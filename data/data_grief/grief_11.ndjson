And that's how it should be. To those of you that are really suffering with your grief...I've been there. Continue to reach out in whatever way you need to. My thoughts are with you.\n\nBut because of the fact that most of the people here are suffering, it can make people who aren't feel like they're doing their grief wrong, or they're in denial and suppressing their feelings, and most of the time that is not the case.\n\nOver the past few decades grief researchers have found that the majority of people come out of grief okay. They don't forget their loved one, and there will always be some sadness, but their symptoms are mostly manageable even in the early stages and they can be functional and even experience joy and laughter, and over time things get back to normal, or a new normal at least. Here's a nice summary of the findings of one of the foremost grief researchers:\n\n [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George\\_Bonanno#Contributions\\_to\\_the\\_field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bonanno#Contributions_to_the_field) \n\nMake no mistake, some of us (about 15% in most studies) have complicated grief and will struggle for awhile. Those people likely will need professional intervention and as a society, we should do more to help them than we are. We shouldn't pressure them to \"get over it\" and make them feel like an outcast for not putting on a happy face. Those of you in that situation now, you have my sympathy, and I'm so sorry this has happened to you.\n\nBut if you're NOT feeling that way, do not feel like there's something wrong with you, or like you're suppressing your emotions and will pay the price for it later. As Bonnano says, if you think you're doing okay, you're doing okay.\n\nBTW if you're interested in reading more about this, I recommend the book The Other Side Of Sadness by Bonnano. It takes a very scientific look at grief with lots of complex studies of people who have been through major traumatic losses or events.

I was certain we'd get a phone call in the middle of the night that my dad had died in the ICU.\n\nI grieved my dad's death for a second time at the house when he collapsed from what we now know was an attack of ventricular tachycardia. I held his face, a deep red going purple, as I yelled at him to keep his eyes open.\n\nLater that night at the hospital, I grieved a third time when they called Code Blue on him twice, when I saw half of the damn staff pile into his room, heard the defibrillator charge up, and a fully grown 6 ft+ man get on top of him and start chest compressions, my dad's brand new stitches tearing. \n\nI grieved again, certain he had to be dead for sure this time, when the EP specialist at hospital # 3 said that he couldn't help him, that if he attempted the ablation procedure he said he would do, my dad would either bleed out on the table from his new sutures rupturing or because his heart would go into an electrical storm, spasming wildly until it finally stopped.\n\nHe's stable now. They were able to get his heart to beat normally again with ablation at hospital # 4.

In fact, one weekend, me and Jeremy were 6 or 7 and mom told us one day we couldn't go up.  I called papaw anyway and acted like it was business as usual.  When mom called frantic saying we were missing... yeah long term isn't a priority at that age \n\nDuring our childhood, they said their goal for us was to save enough money when we turned 18, we could go to college and focus on studies only (We went and both got bachelor's, me in business and jerm in marketing).\n\nThey took us on sunmer vacations.  After third grade, it was a road trip from KY to the Grand Canyon.  Having weathered that, papaw convinced us next summer we'd drive to Alaska, stopping at the mall of America, Mt Rushmore, the Badlands, Canadian Rockies, a ferry up the coast of Alaska, and down through Seattle on the way back towards home.  Long but life-changing!  When we took French II in high school, they paid for our trips to France (Me the first year, Jeremy the next year).  And that's the only time we've been seperated, we're 36.\n\nSo my twin lives with my mom and stepdad, five minutes away.  My mom's side of the family, we've suffered some serious losses starting in the '10s (My mom's uncle died of human mad cow so you can guess how it went).  And upon losing sister #2, my mom was losing her grip.  I'll share another day the unbelievable odds she faced in '09, my first month of sobriety after 12 years of using and how I faced every fucking demon imaginable....and everything came out ok..\n\nFast forward to January of this year.  Mamaw had been having a rough go since last year, just not her usual self.  Me and gramps even discussed it, chalking it up to old age at the time (We were oblivious to what could really be wrong).\n\nIn a nutshell, mamaw was diagnosed with a UTI and also she had been hospitalized.  Papaw asked if I'd care for her and he would help.  Of course, Jeremy came everytime and then some when we needed him.\n\nBut mamaw took two steps forward and 15 back.  Multiple ER visits, they said low sodium and potassium.  She was sleeping 20 hours a day.  And my mamaw still cooked a meat and three vegetables,  cleaned house, and sewed and did crafts recently.\n\nIn July, we had to go call an ambulance.  I knew then this shit was going to get very real.\n\nAnd this is one thing that is eating me alive.  I had to help mamaw on a small porta potty and papaw was outside.  Not able to safely pull her pants up because she went weak, I sit her on our couch and was gonna see if papaw's mower was on the hill (Same room still, five steps away).  I even cushioned her in on both sides.  If he was mowing, calling his phone would be fruitless no hearing aids in.  As soon as I said, he's done, crack.\n\nShe basically mimicked a stroke, she rolled left and could do absolutely nothing and went face first into the hardwood.  And noticing it knocked her wind out, I sit there rubbing her back.  I still remember saying, \"It's knocked your wind out mamaw, breathe with me, it's ok, I'm not going anywhere I'm staying right here.\"\n\nTo say that this shreds me is an understatement.  But that day papaw become more convinced and I was adamant she'd had a stroke.  \n\nSo I've gotten really upset about the hardwood fall... it's the second time I've told it and I feel drained.  But I think everyone can get a good sense of where we stood so I have to shorten the next bit.\n\nIt wasn't long before an MRI revealed a mass in the brain (it was 2cm, 6cm spot, by the brain stem).  And even though it wasn't cancerous, she was so weak by this point treatment wasn't viable.\n\nShe told me many times if she couldn't get up and do anything she was ready to go.  And let me tell you, proudly, my mamaw was a proud Christian.  She talked the talk and walked the walk \ud83d\udcaf.  \n\nAnd one day in May, papaw was gone, she said Justin, I'm dying.\n\nAhh mamaw, you're not going anywhere yet.  \n\nI want you and Jeremy to get back in church and I wanna go before your papaw.  I'm too nervous to handle losing him.  Promise you'll take care of him..\n\nSo I started attending church the first Sunday and have enjoyed it immensely.  I'm a Christian since I was 12 but political bs drove me away as a teen (Baptist Church in KY can be something).\n\nAnd I won't leave papaw until I see it through.\n\nMainly, my situation is my papaws a man of few words... hearing has a hand in that....but I have felt so alone all year.  I've screamed into my pillow, I have the worst rollercoaster of emotions.  I'm seriously about bedridden one week, getting up to wash a few clothes or cook.\n\nAnd I guess throwing myself into this, I've neglected me.  I'm not complaining...but now I can't find joy at all.  That scares me.  I was most outgoing my sr yr of HS and was the guy who can take over a room.\n\nI worry my spark won't come back.  I've battled depression but this is different.  I don't feel unhappy all the time but realistically, I know I am.\n\nAnd I just needed to get all this out.  I'm the one people turn to for answers and I'm used to being a leader.  But unfortunately, ppl express bewilderment to know I've battled depression.  \"I never noticed.\"  \"You weren't depressed.\"  And my favorite \"You're always so happy.\"\n\nWhat bothers me more is I don't wanna sound selfish because this group, you all are here for a reason, too.  And each and every person, whatever your loss, I send you my prayers.\n\nSo idk what I'm asking for really.... maybe just for somebody to say I understand completely.  \n\nFor the first time in a long time, I'm lost.  And I'm not ashamed to be the one to say I may need some help.\n\n\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb in advance if you stayed with my story and I look forward to reading others stories and offering anything I have.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He was an alcoholic and we didn\u2019t have a close relationship. He was never bad to me and I didn\u2019t even know he was an alcoholic until I was an adult, but he was just never around. He saw me every other weekend for a few years when I was small and disappeared for years when I was about 7 until I was in my teens. He got sober for a good 5 years and we connected a little during that time, but then he relapsed. I don\u2019t know how he died exactly, the toxicology reports haven\u2019t come back yet, but I\u2019m betting either an accidental mixing of meds with alcohol or suicide from overdose.\n\nI\u2019ve had a lot of mixed feelings about the situation. Relieved he\u2019s not suffering, angry because he couldn\u2019t be a father to me, sad because no there\u2019s no chance to have a good relationship in the future. I feel guilty because I didn\u2019t keep in good contact with him when he was sober because I was angry from him not being there for me when I was a kid in poverty with a struggling single mom. I didn\u2019t lash out at him or tell him off, but I wanted him to make the effort to reach out and reconnect. I wanted him to make up for what he did and finally be responsible and show me he cared. But he never did and now he\u2019s dead. More recently, I started processing everything and seemed to be doing well. I was having some positive feelings about my dad and felt forgiving.\n\nUntil the beginning of September when I got a call about my grandma. She\u2019s in her late 60s, she\u2019s physically healthy, but was recently diagnosed with dementia, which was pretty mild. Also, my dad was her only child. After my dad died, her dementia seemed to worsen rapidly.\n\nMy grandma had tried to kill herself by jumping out of a window. She shattered her ankle and broke several vertebrae. She was in the ICU, a medical floor, and then was moved to a Geri psych unit. While there, she declined even more and started lashing out and yelling, which she had never done. She was in the hospital for months because no rehab would take her due to her behavior. A few weeks ago, my grandpa was going to take her home, but then they found bleeding in her brain. She\u2019s still in the hospital now isn\u2019t doing well. She even needs people to feel her, which I know is not a good sign.\n\nI\u2019ve also been told that before my dad died he would drunkenly call her to say he was going to kill himself. Apparently he did this often and she would tell him that he couldn\u2019t live without him. Then he told her that they should go together.\n\nSo I\u2019ve been so so so so angry and I don\u2019t know how to deal with it. I feel like my dad did nothing good in his life and even in death he only could do shitty things. His ashes aren\u2019t even buried yet and I want to smash the urn. I am so close with my grandma and she helped raise me because my dad wasn\u2019t there. I live several states away but I\u2019ve been taking off a lot of work to come see her as much as I can. I know she\u2019s going to die soon and I\u2019m afraid each time will be the last time I see her.\n\nSo I\u2019m at my grandparent\u2019s house right now so I can visit her the next few days. I figured I would go through some of my grandma\u2019s things that she has out to remind me of our memories together. And right before I decided to post this, I found she had saved my dad\u2019s wallet- completely preserved from when he died. I decided to look through it because for some reason I still want to feel close to him.\n\nAnd I found a picture of me. None of his other kids. Just me. One of the pictures from my senior year in high school, which was 10 years ago. I don\u2019t know how to process it. I feel so torn because I\u2019m still angry, but also happy that he was thinking about me all this time.\n\nThank you for listening or at least being a place I could write this and get it out of me.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Last Thursday my grandmother (I called her Nanny and will refer to her as such from here on) went in for a heart ablation. Nanny was in congestive heart failure and she had COPD as well. She had been going downhill for the last couple of years but every time I would come over or talk to me on the phone, she did her best to put on a front to not let me see how weak she really was, but the last couple of times I saw her I could tell something was wrong. She had very little energy and basically couldn't breathe without the assistance of supplemental oxygen. Anyways, the doctors put her under and they were getting ready to operate when her heart stopped. No heart attack, no stroke, no seizure or anything. It just quit. The doctors immediately began CPR and ended up having to shock Nanny 7 times to bring her back. During this time her brain recived very little oxygen. They put her in the CCU on short term life support, at this point I'm in North Carolina working and have no idea this is even going on. I talked to my Grandpa that morning while they were searching for the hospital to have her procedure done. I didn't realize then that I had already heard my grandma's last words to me, secondhand over the phone. \"Is that (OP)? Tell him I love him.\" I ended up driving 12 hours Saturday night/Sunday morning to see her. I went to the hospital twice a day every day all week. It seemed like for every piece of good news we got, 10 bad reports followed. Ironically, her heart was doing fine. The difribilator somehow shocked it back into rythymn.  As time went on, it was becoming more apparent that my Nanny was not going to get better. She was unable to breathe effectively without the ventilator, her liver was in shock, and doctors were concerned about brain damage. Family came down to visit, and concersations between my Grandpa, my uncle, and I were had about when it was time to \"pull the plug\" as Nanny did NOT want to be on long term life support. We tried everything to get her to wake up and breathe on her own. Talking to her, squeezing her hand, etc. Doctors said she responded to pain but I couldn't bring myself to test that for myself. I held her hand and stroked her hair for hours on end, telling her how much I love her and how I wish I could have been a better grandson. Finally, Wednesday afternoon the straw that broke the camels back. The report from the neurologist. Hee brain stem was intact, which explained all the muscle and eye movement we saw from her. Her cerebrum however has sustained moderate to severe damage. Doctors could keep her alive, but she would likely never recover from her vegetative state. Thursday morning just after 10:00, my Grandpa told me he was about to do it. I nodded in agreement. The RN took out the ventilator tube and all the other shit they had down her throat. It was just me, my Gramps, my Great Aunt (her sister) and my aunt (her sisters daughter) in the room. Me and my Grandpa were the only people from her every day life to be there for her at the end. Both my mother and uncle, her only 2 kids, never showed up. I held her hand and caressed her face while she took her last breaths. It took less than half an hour off of the vent for her little body to give up. Just like that, a woman I have known from the day I was born is gone. All I wanted was to hear her voice one more time. I've never had to deal with the death of someone so close to me before, nor have I seen anyone actually die in front of me. It feels like someone reached into my chest and tore off a piece of my soul. She had no qualms about letting anyone know that I was the light of her life. I'm honestly in a state of shock right now, and have been since about 11:30 Thursday morning. I did everything I could possibly do for her, but it wasn't enough. She just didn't have the fight in her anymore. I don't know what to do, I knew this would happen one day but I had hoped it would be another 5 or 10 years off at least.

He was dealing with liver issues for 3 years before that (years of unhealthy living and drinking) - so the cancer was a surprise. He was given 6 months to live. He was remarried and living 4 hours from me.   \nLess than a month after diagnosis, my step-mom called me on a Friday and said he wasn't doing well and I should come see him. Instead of going that night, I decided to wait until the morning. I packed a bag to stay for a while, thinking I would give myself a week and plan out my next few months of visits.   \nI took my time getting there. A casual morning drive in an attempt to prepare myself to see the strongest man in my life in his weakest moments. My older sister was flying in to see him as well. Midway through my drive she let me know she landed and was on her way to his house. Our step-mom picked her up at the airport. A couple hours later I pulled up and sat in the driveway.

My feelings of grief are amplified by the circumstances surrounding his death which have lead me to keenly feel the mocking nature of fate. He was a relatively young man who was turning his life around after making a lot of admittedly dumb decisions. He did three and a half years in the State penitentiary for drug dealing. He lost his business, his wife, and all of his money. Add to that he was diagnosed with cancer while incarcerated. Through it all - I don\u2019t see how- but he persevered. We gave him all the support we could but it wasn\u2019t much as my wife was struggling with her own devastating illness and in fact passed away while he was in jail. But he beat cancer and even became an aide in the Prison Hospice. He took classes while incarcerated because he had decided to work with the disabled when he got out. He used his time locked up to learn and better himself. He learned American Sign Language and Tagalog (to honor his late mother who was Filipino). She would have been so very very proud. Upon release he was truly a different person. Totally remade and ready for the new world he had made for himself. He started another business, too. This one providing transportation and support for the elderly disabled and hearing impaired individuals designed to help them remain independent. It was a hit. The accounts started coming. In addition, he started working for an amazing theater group of all hearing impaired actors. And to put the icing on top, he and the director of the theater fell deeply in love and were to be married. Everything was set. A bright future filled with new love and new purpose lay before him. His painful past was truly behind him...But it wasn\u2019t to be. On his way home from a long day of work at 9:53pm, Nov 2, 2018, he was killed by a drunk driver (who survived the crash, of course). How could he have come through all he came through just to lose his life in this way? It still feels like a sick joke. A sad,sick, mocking joke.

That she probably battled with her whole life. The last six months she deteriorated fast. A dementia that developed quickly and a body that worsened. The doctors are shocked that everything happened so quickly and they didn\u2019t see anything pointing to some medically underlying cause. I honestly think she gave up. She didn\u2019t have the will or strength to continue on. Because of that I\u2019m happy she went so quickly.

He always worked his ass off to support our family, and he even worked for years through the myriad of health problems and weird diseases that eventually took his life, though he did have to retire early when he became too sick to work.  I was always provided for and never wanted for necessities, and for my young childhood to early teens we were actually pretty well off.  However, he was a narcissist, as well as emotionally and physically abusive.  He was verbally and emotionally abusive to my mother, and every once in a while he would shove or slap her, and he was the same with me.  I didn't have it nearly as badly as some people, he never put either of us in the hospital or anything, but it still has left me with relatively few happy memories of him.\n\nAnyway, he died after a several month long period of progressively worsening COPD from smoking, the cherry on top of two decades of heart attacks, auto immune diseases, and medical issues caused by drugs he had to take for those things.  However, when he died I found that I wasn't as devastated as I thought I'd be, and I rationalized it as shock or whatever.  But it's been more than six months and I don't really miss him.  The reason I'm writing this is that, last night, I had a dream he was alive again, and I wasn't happy about it.  In the dream I was annoyed and frustrated that he was there because I knew he was supposed to be dead.  Does this make me a bad person? Am I ungrateful for not missing him despite the fact that he never left our family or hurt us too badly or stopped providing for us?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

It wasn't serious, he said, and the first couple days in the hospital the doctors confirmed he had no serious injuries. He was being kept to monitor low blood pressure that may have caused him to faint. I stayed with him, keeping him company and encouraging him to rest and to enter a rehab facility after. He was alert, and we talked and laughed as always. I thought he'd be fine.\n\nOn Thursday, I expressed concern that he seemed confused, but nurses and doctors told me it was normal. On Friday morning, I was told he'd have a final CT scan before moving into the rehab center to gain strength. That scan revealed serious brain bleeding, and Dad was transferred to a hospital that could deal with brain trauma. There were ups and downs and inconclusive information, but my brother and I were finally told the brain bleeding was worsening despite interventions, and that *if* my dad pulled through, he'd be unable to eat, move, talk, or do anything but sit and be cared for the rest of his life in a nursing home. He was no longer conscious or speaking, and it was clear from body tremors and tension that he was in great mental anguish. We decided on hospice and stayed with him 24 hours a day while he passed.  He passed while my brother had left to give his wife an anniversary present, and while I was sitting chatting with my best friend. We sat with him for a couple hours after he passed.\n\nWithin days, we'd arranged a funeral and prepared his house for family from out of state. We cried, we laughed, we told stories. We buried him in Chuck Taylors since they were all he wore, and with a Nerf gun because one family holiday tradition was epic Nerf battles. I managed to write something to say at his memorial, and he had a military funeral, which was touching.\n\nThere are still things to settle, but things have certainly slowed down from the chaos of the last couple weeks. Now I'm emotionally a mess. I can't believe he's actually gone. I can't believe it all happened so suddenly, but the doctors think the bleeding preceded the fall, and notes we've found and observations about his behavior we're pieced together make us think he knew he was dying and didn't tell us. His medical records reveal a brain lesion he hadn't told me about.\n\nI go from shock to pain. Nothing has ever hurt this much. I can't believe I thought I'd experienced heartbreak before. I miss him so much already, and I'm replaying things that are causing me to feel immense regret and guilt (missed calls, missed visits, being impatient with him sometimes). I can't believe I'll never sit with him or laugh with him again. He was the cutest, funniest, sweetest man. I can't do anything without thinking about him. I look at my dog and think about how much he loved her. I start to eat and think about how we'll never have a meal together again.

We were young scientists on a remote and temporary field station on a secluded beach in Costa Rica. That time of my life, and I think all of our lives, was transformative to us, and we shared a special bond. One of the girls, D, was in my class in Uni, and we were close friends and travelled again together before graduation- we went on separate adventures to separate coasts but kept in touch and followed each other\u2019s journeys. \n\nEarlier this year D was killed in a horrible tragedy. This occurred during a particularly painful time in my life. A week before D, a friend of mine from high school took his own life. And in the same catastrophic accident that killed D, another friend from my university class lost her life. I kind of didn\u2019t know how to cope with all this loss all at once, but my grief fixated on D because of our history. I spiralled and have been seeking help to deal with things better and am feeling optimistic with therapy. \n\nI have an opportunity to go back to Costa Rica for a week at a discounted flight cost, with one of my long distance best friends. This friend said he would be willing to drive down and visit my old beach for part of the trip (even though our old camp no longer exists). My heart is pulling me to go because I feel like I need to go back to this beach, close my eyes and feel like D is alive and next to me one more time and cry my eyes out and leave memorials for her. \n\nEveryone encourages me to go, but I have a history of impulsivity over the course of my grief (substance overuse, spending a lot of money on tattoos, etc). I am a graduate student who is not making a whole lot of money (I break even with a tiny bit leftover after rent, expenses and general life stuff). I have some classes that I may miss one lecture of.

Hugs to all that need them.\n\nI lost my Mom some time ago, and thought I went through some healthy grieving but I guess I unknowingly delayed it. I was her caregiver and stayed in the house for over a year afterwards. When I finally sold it and moved out, it hit me hard. It\u2019s still hitting me hard.\n\nMy therapist (a psychologist) says that grief is like rewiring your brain. I\u2019ve had dizziness, head throbbing, I just feel off and wobbly. I\u2019ve had a checkup with my primary care physician, even saw a cardiologist just in case. I\u2019m getting good sleep, I\u2019m eating well, and I\u2019m getting 30 mins of cardio most days. And yet, some days I just feel like shit. It\u2019s giving me crazy anxiety that something else is wrong, but multiple doctors tell me it\u2019s just grief and anxiety.\n\nIt\u2019s really hard to wrap my head around the physical symptoms grief can cause. From what I read, I guess it can really mess with your brain, neurotransmitters and all, and cause all kinds of things. But my anxiety doesn\u2019t wanna believe it.\n\nAnyone been through this? What kind of physical symptoms does grief cause you all? Can you recommend any good reading on it? Understanding it better might help me.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

{"post_id": "dsco20", "created_utc": 1573023508, "title": "For my Sweet Momma", "author": "undedheart", "self_text": "Hello, all. This is my first time writing here... and also my first time writing about my mom's passing. Perhaps it's a little late, considering it happened in May of this year, but... well, here I am. I apologize if it's a little long. Just a warning, I describe how I found my mom.\n\nSome backstory--my parents had a really rough divorce when I was in high school. I mean, whose divorce isn't rough? But they \"dated\" off and on, saw other people, cheated on those people with each other, and even filed domestic abuse charges at one point, all while still living under the same roof--with me and my younger brother.\n\nMy mom always liked to have a little wine every now and then, but when the divorce came things got serious. I was finding empty bottles of cheap vodka under the bed, in the garage, and various other strange places in the house. But fast-forward about 10 years, and the drinking continued. My mom got together with a guy she grew up with, and the two of them seemed to have the sweetest relationship, though I know she always, always loved my dad. I knew her drinking was a problem, and had tried many times to talk to her about it, but I never wanted to be the bad guy. Plus I knew I couldn't make her stop and that only she could do that if she really, truly wanted to quit.\n\nOne day, she was so ill from drinking she was admitted to the hospital and ended up staying there for months. From that moment on, she never drank again (to my knowledge). But here's where the real slippery slope happened... My mom's drinking caused a whole slew of other health problems, some of which I didn't even know could be associated with drinking and were awfully gruesome to see her go through. Her health slowly recovered over a couple of years, and her doctors said she no longer needed a liver transplant. What a miracle! \n\nDuring her recovery, I recommended my mom talk to a therapist about the alcoholism and the divorce. She was open to it, but had a difficult time finding one. Finally, my mom got in with a psychiatrist, but things were sketchy from the start. The psychiatrist had extremely short sessions with my mom, which ended in her getting a prescription for oxycodone. I do believe my mom was in constant pain, but I wish she'd never gotten that prescription. She traded one addiction for another, and let me tell you--it doesn't take much to be life-threatening. She was always prescribed very low doses and generally took them as directed, but it ultimately took her life.\n\nThe night she died was just like any other. She and my stepdad watched the series finale of Game of Thrones. She came into my room and kissed me on the head and said goodnight. She'd had a fever all day, but didn't want to see a doctor. I wish, so much, that I had pushed her harder to go to the hospital... And about an hour later, my stepdad came into my room and said \"something is wrong, you better come here.\"\n\nI'm pretty sure it was far too late by the time the paramedics arrived. She wasn't breathing when we found her. It turns out that she had gone into respiratory failure, from the oxycodone. She had taken more than prescribed, but not enough to suspect suicide. And I believe, with all my heart, that it wasn't suicide... We had talked earlier that day about doing some gardening together in the coming days. She was feeling really well and had even wanted to start going for walks to get back in shape. And now... I don't even know. Sometimes I just feel numb. More than anything, I just feel love for her. I feel guilt too... like I should have been harder on her. I knew she had a problem with the oxycodone, but again, I didn't want to be the bad guy. I urged her to stop all the time but it wasn't enough. I should have done more. Even though it's been months, it still doesn't feel real. I still feel like I'm going to see her soon, somehow. But I know that's not true...\n\nTL;DR - My mom traded alcoholism for an addiction to oxycodone, which ultimately took her life. I love her and miss her dearly... she was my best friend. I live with my stepdad now in the same place my mom passed away, and tonight I heard him crying quietly in his room. I wish I knew what to say.\n\nIf you read all of that, thank you. I just wanted to get it out of my head.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

We lost my paternal grandmother, the matriarch of my family and one of the closest and most important people in my life. She was my third parent and checked a lot of boxes for me that my own mom didn't. She was almost 90 and very ill, and it was not unexpected. She passed in her sleep after a quick decline.\nThree weeks later, we lost my maternal aunt. She was in her sixties, very disabled from a motorcycle wreck ten years ago. She was in terrible health due to smoking and prescription drug addiction, but the death was very unexpected. An undetected lung infection put her into septic shock and she died of it within days. I was not close to her, and sadly she spent much of her life as a very mean person. She wasn't totally without redeeming qualities, but she died having estranged her children and grandchildren, leaving my mother her sole caretaker and heir at the end.\nI'm struggling with the loss of my grandma. I've had some new life events happen since her death, which only underscores the fact that she's not here to share in them with me. I wasn't ready for her death despite her age and condition.\nOne strange issue that's coming up for me lately is that I feel really angry (internally, I don't show it!) when my mom displays grief over her sister. My aunt took advantage of my mom's generosity in my opinion, and laid the entire burden of her needs on my mom without compunction. She was mean, cruel and the relationship seemed completely one-sided to me. My grandmother and my mom had a great healthy relationship, but it seems like my mom is so much more wrapped up in the death of her sister. It's like Grandma's passing is old news.\nI'm NOT the grief police and I can tell this is inappropriate, so I have not voiced this to anyone.

On mobile so please excuse formatting. \n\nAs the title says, I lost my dad this past June. I had been is sole caretaker for several years and finally convinced him to move in with me almost 2 years ago. We converted our garage into a nice little one bedroom for him so he could still have his personal space and I was only steps away when he needed something. We got almost 2 years of him here with us. My daughter grew closer with him and we had a wonderful relationship. He was my best friend. I found him on the morning of June 24th laying in the floor, unresponsive. I had begged and begged the night before to take him to e.r. because I just knew something was wrong.\n\nI can't get over the feeling that I didn't do enough. I should have been there. He shouldn't have died alone when I was only a few steps away. I can't get the picture of him laying there out of my head. Everytime I look over at the apartment and don't see his light on it physically hurts me. I want to tear it down.\n\nLogically I know there is nothing that I could have done. When it's your time, it's your time, but I just can't stop those thoughts and I break down constantly. I'm fine one minute and in the floor crying the next. My doctor has me on medication for depression and anxiety, but it's not helping much.\n\nI lost my mom when I was 18 and I'm now closing in on 35 and this is just so much harder. Not that I loved my mom any less, but i just can't explain it. I feel like I'm never going to get over the \"freshness\" of it all and I'm suffering silently. \n\nAnyway I just needed to get that out there into the world.

Or even others?", "author": "assstastic1", "self_text": "So a little background...I lost my older sister a few weeks ago.  She was only 26 and had two young children. For a couple of years now she had been becoming more and more addicted to opioids such as pain pills. Every year it got worse to the point where she was so high that she would fall asleep sitting up and talking during family events. We tried to help her but she would get very upset and accuse us of not loving her and she would say things like 'maybe it's best if I just die'. She would call us all hours of the night when she 'freak outs' like this and as awful as this sounds, it got exhausting. \n\nShe wasn't willing to accept help and she didn't believe she had a problem. A few weeks before her passing, she was arrested for driving under the influence with her children in the car. She was going 40 mph on a freeway and had reportedly almost caused a semi to crash when she cut them off. We knew it was extremely serious at this point as she was not only risking hurting herself but others as well. She was also in the middle of a nasty custody battle and this was not helping her case. She was held over the weekend and then was willing to check into a rehab facility. For a few weeks, things seemed better. Her boyfriend was monitoring her medication by keeping it locked away and her texts and calls no longer sounded like nonsense that you couldn't even make out. She was getting excited for the holidays and we were all starting to talk more. My mom even said \"I can see the fun, happy Shay coming back\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then one night I was in the bath tub and my sister calls and says \"she's dead\" while I hear my mom screaming and screaming in the background. I just sobbed in the tub. I couldn't move and my boyfriend had to come help me out and drive me to my mom's. My sisters were outside in the cold because they couldn't be in the house with my mom screaming and crying. My  sister who passed lived 45 minutes away and my oldest sister lived nearby so she was there waiting with the children on the front lawn for the coroner to come get her body while neighbors drove by recording and taking pictures. Small town. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt turns out, my sister had secretly gotten a 90 day prescription on oxys that her PA (who has been over medicating her for a year now) gave to her per request every single time she asked. Prescription for a month gone in two weeks? No problem, let me refill ya. We all believe it was an accident as there was no note and she was doing a lot of future talk, but we'll never really know for sure. She had a great night with her family, went to bed and never woke up. I guess she just overdid it, but does it really matter? It doesn't hurt any more or less either way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so guilty every single day since. I should have answered more of her calls. I should have fought harder to make her get treatment even if it made her mad. I should have been a better sister the last few years. She wasn't the same person who I grew up with, the pills changed her. Because of that, I just grew...irritated with her. And when my grief turns to rage I begin to blame others. How did her boyfriend who lived with her and was monitoring her meds not notice her change? Why didn't he say anything? Why is that PA not responsible for killing my sister? Why was she able to do that? And even though I know it's not my mother's fault, why didn't my mom do something about the text she got the night before where my sister said she was so sad she was struggling? How did every single person in her life manage to fail her enough that this is how it ended? How do I accept everything? How do I not spend my life going through cycles of guilt and rage and hatred? What do I do now that a piece of my heart is gone forever?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

It was all very private. But I wanted to write something for her. One, because she would have deserved it. Two, I think it's like a therapy for me. So here it is:\n\nMy Mother\n\nMy Mother spent half of her life struggling. \u00a0She spent the other half struggling and being a Mother. \u00a0The first half of her life, she found it hard to feel like she belonged. \u00a0The second half of her life, she found her purpose for living, and knew then that she belonged. \u00a0You see, my Mother probably never knew it, but even though I was her only blood, she still had family. \u00a0She had that family in some of you, and in some that aren\u2019t here. \u00a0She most importantly, had that family in me, always. \u00a0My Mother did not get to do much in her life. \u00a0Sure, she went a few places, and did a few fun things, but I know for a fact that there was a lot more that she would have loved to do. \u00a0But I can tell you this: while she didn\u2019t get to do much in her life, what she never knew was that above all else, she was a hero. \u00a0My hero. \u00a0The things that she did do in her life, that were more important than any place she could have gone, truly made her the best Mother she could be. \u00a0And I know that for my Mother, even if she didn\u2019t know that she was, that would have meant the world to her. \u00a0My Mother never got to go to Ireland, but she spent countless times and hours taking care of me when I was sick or hurt. \u00a0My Mother never got be famous for her singing, but she always made me feel famous when she\u2019d cheer me on in choir. \u00a0My Mother didn\u2019t get to go many places I\u2019m sure she wishes she could have, but my Mother took me so many places and made so many memories for me to never forget. \u00a0Like the time we won tickets to see Bruce Springsteen. \u00a0I think that was one of the happiest times of her life. \u00a0Her favorite singer, with her only, and favorite Daughter. \u00a0My Mother spent most of her life missing her own Mother, and I\u2019m sure my Mother may have questioned sometimes whether or not she was a good Mother. \u00a0But, without a doubt, I can tell you that her Mother would have been proud of her, because she was the best Mother she could have been. \u00a0And for that, I am so thankful. \u00a0I\u2019m so thankful that this woman spent half of her life, loving me and taking care of me, even though I know that sometimes she felt like she couldn\u2019t. \u00a0I miss my Mother every single day. \u00a0I miss her voice, I miss her face, and I miss her saying \u201cI love you, Bunny.\u201d \u00a0But I know that I carry a part of her with me always. \u00a0Every time my heart beats, that\u2019s part of her heart beating. \u00a0I have her voiced saved, and so she can still tell me in her own voice that she loves me, and for that, I am forever grateful. \u00a0And, I can always look in a mirror to see her face. \u00a0I carry my Mother on with me into my future, and I know without a doubt, that she\u2019s singing and dancing in the skies, shining down and smiling upon me so that I may continue a happy life. \u00a0Even in the afterlife, I know that she\u2019s still taking care of me. \u00a0So while my Mother never went to Ireland, or sang with a band, I go on living my life with the courage and strength to do the things she never got to in her memory. \u00a0She gives me this courage and strength, even though she\u2019s gone in the physical form. \u00a0\n\nI will add one last thing to this, and if you haven\u2019t thus far, then please listen now. \u00a0If you\u2019re lucky enough to still have your parents around, then hug them. \u00a0Hug them tight, tell them you love them, and make as many memories with them as you can.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

After several hugs and reassurances that it's good to cry it out instead of bottling it up (for me, anyway, but it seemed to help her, too), I had her walk with me to my desk for some eye drops (to hide some of the evidence of her crying), and a bag of candy for her meeting (so no one would fuss about her being late). I had gotten hugs from coworkers who came across my crying, so it was a little nice to pay it forward.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

She was 4 yrs old when I got her in 2007, picked up off the side of the road after someone had dumped her. \n\tI was going to take her to the vet anyway that morning to see about getting her some better arthritis medication, but other than her hips giving her grief, she was fine. She was playing with me yesterday, ran up to my car when i pulled in from school, talked to me (barked, playful growl) as i got her food.\n\t As I was going to bed I went over to her dog bed and told \u201c I love you, Kyra. Night Night\u201d and she gave me kiss on the hand and face and I went to bed. When I got up at 7:45 to take her to the vet my dad had tears in his eyes and when I looked at Kyra her eyes were moving back and forth rapidly, she couldn\u2019t walk, her left leg was totally stiff, she wouldn\u2019t move her head from one position and she couldn\u2019t control the left side of her face. At this point I was already thinking stroke.\n\t My dad said she had messed her dog bed (peed) and he put her in her other bed and that she drank all the water he gave her that morning and ate her food, but that doesn\u2019t really mean much when a 16 year old dog has a stroke.  So we made the decision to take her to the vet and have her put down. We put her dog bed in the back of my car and my dad rode with me. He talked to her and petted her as we were driving but I\u2019m not even sure she knew where she was or who we were. She died in my car before we made it to the vet. We took her to the vet anyway to have her vital signs checked. But when I looked in her eyes I knew. We brought her back home and put her in her casket we made for her. \n\tThe look in her eyes was exactly how my grandma looked before she died, the rapid movement, much like REM, not knowing what was happening. It hurts so much and reminds me so much of my grandma ( she passed Nov. 10, 2017). \n\tI just wanted to share because I haven\u2019t talked to anyone about this except for my parents and I haven\u2019t cried in front of either of my parents, but I went and cried to Kyra, my beautiful baby girl, one last time like I have for so many years. Many, many times I\u2019ve been on the brink of offing myself and stopped because Kyra needed me. She always looked at me with so much love in her eyes, in a way that no other dog or human ever has.

I need to ask for advice and vent (also, sorry for all language mistakes, english is not my first language).   \nMy grandpa always was a healthy person, he would go to all the doctors he needed to, he would eat healthy and go fishing, for walks... He also learns a lot about new technologies. He's a great person. One morning he suffered a stroke, which really shocked all of my closest family and friends. Thankfully, we live nearby the hospital, so he turned out okay, he was just dizzy. In the hospital they found out he has \"a hole in his heart\", but then it turned out it wasn't life threatening and they will treat him as soon as he feels a bit stronger. Then another stroke (while driving a car. He then still went to the forest to pick up some mushrooms). And then in the hospital again they found cancer.  Pancreas  and a bunch of other places. He can't have any surgery, so doctors decided on a lighter chemo to try and weaken cancer. Everything happened in span of 2-3 weeks.   \nGrandpa stopped eating. He feels nauseous, nothing tastes him. Grandma is more and more tired by cooking every day new meals, that he might not even feel like eating. He lost a lot of weight, can't sleep regularly, has problem with sight. Do you have any advice on that? I was thinking if it got really bad we could get some drips, so he could at least get hydrated and get some nutrients? But maybe chemo will help and we won't have to. I really don't know what to expect.   \nHe also worries we will leave him, which is weird but I know that our mind during vulnerable moments are shitty and tell us stupid things. His fishing buddies and family call him, talk with him. I hope he soon understands that nobody is going to leave him alone.   \nEverybody in my family griefs completely diferently. Some are angry and pretend it didn't happen, some are sad and come to me to vent, and I try to take action (and get stopped by the rest of my family, and sometimes they are right). Even tried to bring my cousins from another country so we could have nice christmas. Problem is she just had a baby and it would be difficult. I just don't want anybody to regret anything later. Got advice from my therapyst to \"think of things I'd like to do with him, and then do it\". He might get better and we will all laugh about it, but it's just hard sometimes now.  \nI'm sorry, this is too long. And it's more venting than asking for advice.

He was more like a brother. He was in and out of juvie in his teens and then in and out of jail/prison when he became an adult. He had just gotten out of jail three days prior to this. \n\nA little backstory: he was my moms sisters child but I am from a country where cousins are like your other siblings basically. and as the oldest of all the kids in my family I remember getting off the bus in middle school and waiting on the corner to pick him and his brother up from their elementary school bus and walking them to our house.\n\nmy aunt is an amazing and sweet person. very calm for the most part and just genuinely the sweetest one in our family but she always struggled financially and would often get super depressed as a single mom to three small children so they often lived with us on and off. my sister is technically my cousin but she was adopted by my mom because she was the youngest and she just lived with us permanently and so she just lost her biological brother.\n\nwe always visited him wherever he was locked up and would buy him clothes and get him set up with a phone when he got out  but we also tried to give him tough love. we were always so worried he\u2019d think we didn\u2019t care about him and he would be absent for so many milestones that we always showered him with love and whatever he needed when he got out. idk maybe we enabeled him but it was partly picking up the slack for my aunt who we all knew loved him a lot fiercely and different from her other children. Probably because she missed him for such extended amounts of time and the other two (his older brother and my sister) were pretty level headed and never got into trouble.\n\nsorry for the rant but it hasn\u2019t even been a week and while I\u2019ve sobbed on friends shoulders (we\u2019ve all been trying to stay strong for my aunt who can\u2019t accept that he is gone) I haven\u2019t been able to say all this to them. mostly just getting wasted and sobbing while they hug me.\n\nThis is how we found out. I was supposed to train at my new job Sunday at 7am and I remember my sister being fully dressed and waking me up in a rush at 4am asking to borrow my iPhone charger. I was so sleepy that I remember thinking it\u2019s weird because my sister isn\u2019t the type to sneak out but assumed one of her friends was downstairs because they often park in front of my house and hang out talking in their car\u2019s. I immediately went back to sleep because I was supposed to wake up in two hours for work. Then I remember getting a call from my sister at 6am. Right before my alarm was gonna go off actually.\n\nI was still in a sleepy daze and I answered thinking maybe she forgot her keys and someone locked the door on her. She was hyperventilating and crying so hard that I couldn\u2019t understand a word she was saying. At first I was scared that she drove somewhere and got into a bad car accident. She just kept mumbling things and I had to tell her to calm down and explain what was happening. I remember grabbing my coat thinking I\u2019d have to drive to where she crashed. She could barely get words out but she said she was just driving on the highway and didn\u2019t know where she was. Finally she said the words that stopped my fucking heart. She says \u201cW got shot. He\u2019s dead. He\u2019s dead help me H (my name). help me I don\u2019t know where I am and he is dead\u201d. I almost immediately start screaming and start banging on my mom and stepdads room and my brothers room. My mom and stepdad have a lock on their bedroom door and I kept trying the Knob and yelling and crying. I was the one who had to explain it to them. I just started yelling that W is dead and my poor mom jolts awake and almost falls out of bed and is on the ground dazed for a second but starts yelling and crying.\n\nMy sisters version of the events:\nShe gets a call from this girl my cousin was dating at 4am and the girl tells her that he was shot and that they\u2019re at the the hospital. My sister is panicking a little bit but thinks he was just wounded and she told me she didn\u2019t want to wake me up because she knew I had to go to work. She takes my charger and drives to the suburbs where he was. She gets there and immediately says hi I\u2019m W\u2019s sister. They don\u2019t tell her anything and put her in a room where she\u2019s being recorded and ask her a bunch of questions. she\u2019s obviously impatient and frustrated so after a bit she\u2019s just like CAN I PLEASE GO SEE MY BROTHER NOW? One of the officers says \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss\u201d and that\u2019s how she finds out her 21 year old brother is dead. She throws up and is heaving when she has nothing else to throw up. She has to tell her mom and other brother what happened. I\u2019m the third person she called. \n\nI\u2019ve been crying a lot and when I\u2019m not crying I\u2019m just so fucking empty. I\u2019ve always severely struggled with my mental health and I know this is gonna ruin me for a long long time. I feel like an imposter. I feel like I\u2019m just using this as an excuse and that I\u2019m a piece of shit who is inwardly lying to myself and making his death about me. I\u2019ve been disassociating a lot. I\u2019ve been abusing substances (way more than usual). Sometimes I\u2019m so empty and i prefer that to the fucking mess I am the rest of the time. I took the last three work shifts off at my brand new job and went in tonight because I\u2019m off my training period and didn\u2019t want them to be severely understaffed. My boss never emails back so I was worried that I wouldn\u2019t have a job anymore but I also really didn\u2019t fucking care. Several of my coworkers asked why I had been missing for the majority of the week and I had to keep saying \u201cmy cousin died\u201d and I\u2019ve been weirdly over sharing that fact because it doesn\u2019t seem right to hide what happened to him. It\u2019s just been flying out of my mouth all week because why the fuck should I hide what happened so I don\u2019t make people feel uncomfortable? But I\u2019ve also had times where I ignore everyone\u2019s calls because I am exhausted and don\u2019t want to talk about it that day. \n\nThinking (knowing) this is our future without him is killing me.

All I do is walk around and realize that my cousin will never get to experience the things I\u2019m experiencing. \n\nSorry for the rant and thank you all that read all of this.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I haven't been able to mourn the passing of my aunt on my father's side who passed when I was 16 because I still haven't been able to get over his death and smoking is the only thing I do that reminds me of him where I feel close to him. \n\nHe was a pretty bad smoker. I smoke maybe once or twice a day. He would usually smoke a whole pack. I never touched a cigarette or even thought about touching a cigarette before his death. It's more than likely what killed him, or at least definitely sped up the process. He was 49 and died of a heart attack. It's definitely not what he would have wanted. He tried to quit so many times for his family, but the people he hung around were all heavy smokers and I think that maybe it was one of the reasons he couldn't quit.\n\nI feel like whenever I try to quit, I'm losing my uncle. I feel like I have no other way to feel at peace because this is how I coped since I was 14. When I get upset for any other reason I grab a smoke.

It is really hard to even type that because it all still doesn\u2019t feel real. I was his caregiver for 4 years, started when I was 16. I can\u2019t think of him without having those feeling of helplessness and heartbreak come back. Having to dress him, clean up his accidents, bathe him and feed him. I knew I would be the one to caregive for him. Mentally I felt like I was the strongest in my family to do it and I was the only one with no job. But being responsible for his life was fucking terrifying. Caring for him through those 4 years made me almost forget every memory of him before his Alzheimers. It\u2019s been two years and I still can\u2019t think of him without this huge feeling of rage building up. There\u2019s a feeling you get that\u2019s very hard to describe when your father looks at you and has no clue who you are, threatens to kill you cause he thinks your a stranger in his home. And it\u2019s this feeling that I got almost everyday and just the stress of taking care of him that makes me think I\u2019m not gonna live long. I was selfish in my years of caring for him. He had a stroke and was obese so I put him on a healthy diet to get his weight on track because I was so scared of losing him. even though I think now he would want have eaten whatever the fuck he wanted in his final years. A week before he went into the hospital he had almost a perfect day since his Alzheimers. He remembered me, dressed himself, and we even had a sword fight with rolled up magazines I\u2019ll never forget it. He got put on new medication and it seemed to be working well until a week later he fell, ended up in a hospital and the Alzheimers completely over took him. The brightest light in my life taken away so violently. Life is a fucking asshole. He never got to see me get a job, car, girlfriend. He fought so hard for me when I was younger, through my mental health problems only to never live long enough to see it pay off or see me amount to anything.There\u2019s really no point to this post but I need to get what\u2019s constantly in my head out.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

If not homeless, he was incarcerated for low level crimes such as trespassing or assault. Chris was cursed with a cluster fuck of genetics that led to addiction and most likely was sexually assaulted by a neighbor though no one suspected until years later. He had undiagnosed mental health issues and was failed colossally by all systems he came across that were meant to help him. But however messed up our family was/is, we did try to help him to the best of our abilities, myself more than most. Especially early on. From rehabs to money to setting him up in a place to not helping to therapy to church to trying to commit him to ... you name it. But the reality is some people are in too much pain and the patterns get too wired or something-I don\u2019t know for sure. \n\nBut we all knew  it was going to end this way sooner for Chris. He had already been mourned  more times than I can count. We never knew when the final call was going to come. And its good in some ways -the relief in knowing I don\u2019t have to worry about it again. Nonetheless knowing that his life was so miserable and his death was so miserable, well it\u2019s hard to live with sometimes. \n\nHe was handsome and smart and artistic. All of it ruined by the streets and the life he had. \n\nTomorrow, Veterans Day, Is the one-year anniversary of his death. It also happens to be the day he was born 47 years ago. Yep, he died on his birthday.\n\nI wish it had been a better world for you Chris. I wish I could believe you were in a better place but I am glad you are out of pain at least.

He wasn't one to drink or do drugs. The news has left me and many others devastated.\n\nI met Matt just a year prior when me and a friend went to a restaurant and he was our waiter. \"Break Up With Your Girlfriend\" by Ariana Grande was playing, and we talked for an hour about music. \"It's such a good song but a terrible message,\" he'd always say. We shared alot in common.\n\nShortly after he started to work with me and we became really close friends. I was a couple years younger than him but that didn't really make a difference. We'd hang out often and always had a good time together.\n\nWhen he graduated college he left his job to find a better one. It was our last shift together when I hugged him goodbye, and we promised to keep hanging out. That was Monday, 4 days before he was pronounced dead.\n\nWe drove 2 hours for the funeral service. It was a closed casket funeral. We all wanted to see him one last time, but we couldn't. The whole situation felt surreal until I layed my hand on his casket. All the tears poured out and haven't stopped since.\n\nThe other day I got a reminder on my phone of an upcoming concert - a concert he was going to go with me and a few of our friends. Certain songs send me into a deep depression because I can't help but think of him.\n\nA little about me; I have major depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder. In other words, losing Matt has hit me so, so incredibly hard. I'm just in my senior year of highschool. All my mom is concerned about are my grades which have slipped in the last week. I tried explaining my situation, only to be told to \"move on\".\n\nI can't move on. He was only 20 years old. He was one of the greatest people I've met; always smiling, always a beam of sunshine, a genuine heart. It felt like we were friends for so many years but we only met last year. \n\nI miss him so much. I know he doesn't want me to be sad about losing him. I know I need to get back into my schoolwork. But I'm not ready to. I miss him. I don't know what to do since this is the first person I've lost in my life that I cared about so much.\n\nThank you for reading.

{"post_id": "dv52ve", "created_utc": 1573534153, "title": "One Year Anniversary", "author": "iiiBansheeiii", "self_text": "TL; DR Grief is the price of love.\n\nA little more than four years ago I joined Second Life. Through a mutual friend I met a man whose wife was in a semi-conscious state. He needed someone to talk to and I didn't have much of a life and so we talked almost every day. Mostly about his wife and day. His fears for her and things that were happening that she knew nothing of and brainstorming ways to make her life better. She died in April of 2016.\n\nShe was from Finland and they had lived there for 7 years or so, but he didn't speak the language and his kids were here in the States and he decided he was going to come back to the US. He talked about various places to land and eventually asked if I wanted him to come to live in the city I live in. I said, \"Yes.\"\n\nOn January 1, 2017 he took a ship from Finland, a train across Europe, the Queen Elizabeth II across the Pacific, and a train half way across the US. I picked him up at the train station in the middle of the night in the middle of January in winter in a state that knows winter. We found him an apartment nearby, although he went there basically to sleep. He crossed seas, continents, mountains, and oceans to come to me. \n\nI had never been in love before and he was all things remarkable. I told him, and believe, that I had been waiting for him. He was rather dismissive of that idea, but there were some strange connections that make me think I'm more right than not.\n\nHe was 12 years older than I am and had a myriad of health issues. We three health scares  starting in October of 2017, July 2018 and then November 2018, all having to do with his heart, the last two being heart attacks requiring angioplasties. The last angioplasty had complications requiring him to be put on a machine to help his heart rest a bit. He went into the hospital Saturday night, had the surgery on Monday, was on the machine all day Tuesday. I spent most of the time at the hospital. On Wednesday I went back to my apartment to rest for a little while. As I was trying to sleep the phone rang. The ID indicated it was dealing with P's care so I picked up the call to give the information needed. I tried to lie back down and one of my brothers called. At that point I had the overwhelming need to go back to the hospital. I arrived and they told me that they were weaning him off the machine and asked me to wait a half an hour. About 10 minutes later they called a code in his room.\n\nThey sent doctors to talk to me and prepare me for the fact that he wasn't going to survive. I was making frantic calls to his kids (who were apprised of everything multiple times a day) and finally asked if I could please go be with him.\n\nI entered into the controlled chaos that is a code. I walked to the foot of his bed and grabbed his foot and told him. \"I'm here and I'm waiting for you.\" Words we frequently used to tell each other we loved the other. The person performing CPR, said, \"I have a heartbeat.\" Another said, \"I have a pulse.\" So I know, I know he heard me. But he couldn't stay.\n\nTuesday night last year, about this time I had been to the store and noticed that I had a tire losing air. After getting air put in I drove by the hospital and turned in to stop and see P for a little while. We laughed and joked and I left to let him rest.\n\nYesterday when I went to the store I had a low air indicator again and shook my head at the echo. We had planned to marry in October of this year. I am an incredibly fortunate woman. I had often said I would rather be single than be in a bad relationship and at the end of the day I have had love that is beyond any expectation. Yes. 22 months is nothing. I wish it had been 22 years... 44 years... a lifetime, but it was a miracle it happened at all. \n\nIf you got this far, thanks for reading.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

About 3 weeks ago she was at my job attending a concert, having a blast. I hadn\u2019t seen her since August. A little over a week ago we were planning a early thanksgiving celebration because I worked the night before thanksgiving. Wednesday the 6 I\u2019m driving up to her side of town, she had been rushed to the hospital.

She\u2019s been in and out of the hospital a lot lately because her blood sugar has been wacky. \n\nThe second i got to the hospital nurses and doctors rushed in to put my mom on a ventilator. The next morning I get a call at 4:30 that we need to come to the hospital immediately because this will probably be my moms last day. We were told she had a stroke, and there was poor chance of recovery. Her blood sugar was 900 when the paramedics arrived at her house. Her kidneys shut down. Her heart was operating at 30%. If we wanted to try other options she would probably lose her other leg because of poor blood circulation. We made the decision at 10 that morning we would remove her from everything at 1:00pm, to allow everyone who was able to come say their goodbyes. At 2:27pm she took her last breath. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t feel real. I\u2019m still expecting her to call me and ask why I haven\u2019t called her in a few days.

I was the closest to him out of my entire family and it hit me really hard. I'm 15 and while my therapist claims I have more emotional intelligence than most people my age, I still don't know what the fuck to do. I don't think anyone knows what to do when their dad dies though, to be fair. It's a tragedy that only happens once then never again. It changes your entire life.\n\nMy dad gave me this unwavering love and support I didn't even know was possible. We were both artistic minds and he never failed to support me in every artistic endeavor right from the very beginning. He always had my back when no one else did. I don't think I'll ever experience that kind of undivided love and support from anyone else, my father was one of a kind. He was so devoted to his four sons he ended up getting sober for us.\n\nHe was addicted to heroin and I can't imagine the pain he went through to get clean. And after he did, he never used again. Everybody else thought he was going to relapse, I was the only one to believe in him, I wanted to pay him back for all the support and love he'd given me over the years. I had total trust in him to stick it out and he did until the end. I would rather him have relapsed than killed himself but it almost seems kind of selfish to think that I would rather him keep suffering. I miss that man so fucking much but at least he's okay now.\n\nThat brings me to the title of this post. Sea Of Dreams by Oberhofer is my song for him. He's never heard it and I doubt he would even like it that much if he had but every time I listen to it, without fail, I think of him and cry. It's a beautiful song but it has nothing to do with death or his situation in the least so it took me until now to figure out why it reminds me of him.\n\nI've never been one to look too much into religion and the afterlife. My thinking was (and still is to an extent) that I will cross that bridge when I come to it. After all, what's the point in pondering an afterlife if you can never be sure what it's actually going to be? It's wasted thinking. But when I picture my dad in the afterlife, I see him at peace among the stars. Stars that meld together with his paintings to create a beautiful space full of peace and creativity. A sea of dreams. I don't know if that's where he is or if he's anywhere at all, but I like to think that's where he is and that he's finally content among the stars, free of all the burdens that held him back in life.\n\nI miss that man more than anyone will ever know, but he's at peace, and I think that's all he ever wanted. Contentment. Something out of reach for him in life. While I wish he'd just kept reaching for it while he was alive, he's got it now and I'm happy for him. I'll just have to honor him by living where he couldn't, I owe him that much. \n\nDad, if you're out there, I love you, and if you're not, I still love you. I'm glad you're finally okay regardless of how bad I'm hurting. I dunno where you are but hopefully we'll meet again someday. I love you man, never forget that.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I haven't taken my medication today(anti-depressants) and I am back to my real self. To the self that grieves and grieves and grieves and thinks of the what if's.\n\nI didn't have the money to visit him before he died. I tried getting it in so many ways. Even prostitution. But I just couldn't get the money. We barely talked the last few months. He sent me a few messages once a week so I know if he is still alive. He didn't want to video chat cause he had no energy and he didn't want me to see what he looked like. The last time I saw him he was skinny like a skeleton. Coughing constantly. And his face looked as if he aged 35 years. He never smiled in the last couple months I saw him. He didn't want me to remember him that way but when I think about him I imagine how skinny he must have gotten in the hospital. I imagine how if I was there and the moment they said he's gone, I would have started choking on my tears, screaming, probably banging my head against the wall hoping it would kill me. But he made sure that never happens. He said he didn't want to see me. He said he didn't want me to see him.\n\nBut that didn't save me from being in pain. I attempted suicide 5 times and one of those I ended up in the hospital for 8 days, getting my stomach pumped, with convulsions, barely moving, wishing I was dead. All I wanted is to be with him. I'm crying as I write this. In the end it never goes away. Yes, the anti depressants keep me from attempting suicide, but deep down I want to join him. I want to fall into his arms. And here goes the part that might hurt someone reading so please stop here if you lost someone to cancer.\n\nI... Want to die... The way he did. From cancer.\n\nI know it might sound disrespectful. As if I don't know what I'm wishing for. That I am insensitive. That I don't care.\n\nBut if it will help me find him again, then I don't care in which ways I have to kill myself, which illnesses I have to contract. I will do almost anything to one day be with him again.\n\nThis medication keeps me alive but that's all. I am a vegetable. Eat, sleep and breathe. I'm numb. This is all fake. I am not really happy. I am just high on chemicals. I have not gotten over it and I never will.\n\nOne thing I really hate is how the meds have made a long term impact on me and I am 90% less suicidal. And when you are not suicidal it is very hard to kill yourself. So I decided to let my grief out by \"doing things that can give me cancer\" whatever that might mean. But there is another problem. It seems like I am so tired of life and everything that I am too tired to even just drink, or smoke, or do anything to cause self-destruction. I hate this. It feels like a prison. I can't even cry unless I skip my meds. I am not happy. I am not happy. I am just tied to a bed and too tired to try to escape.\n\nHe told me he wants me to find someone new and move on. And here I am with a boyfriend who I love and who loves me, and while yes, I do stay alive for him, I never stop thinking about getting cancer. Yet I don't have enough energy to work towards it.\n\nI'm a prisoner. I am miserable but can't stop smiling because I'm drugged every day. I tried stopping but the withdrawals give me intense mental pain. And every time I do that, surprisingly I don't see him. I don't see myself hugging him. Instead I see my boyfriend crying and ending up just like me, grieving forever.\n\nSo I am basically stuck here. My only hope is dying when I am old one day. Or maybe I will get cancer due to obesity if I'm lucky. I am sorry if this hurt you, but yes, I would be lucky if my grief would stop forever. \n\nI will be continuing my meds again from tomorrow on. I just wanted someone to know that I am in pain, that my happiness is fake and that I am unhappy. I am only alive out of tiredness and not wanting my boyfriend to end up grieving like me.\n\nTLDR I am sorry if this hurt anyone. I have come across some people who attacked me for saying I want cancer but I think this is my way of grieving and it's not any less valid than theirs. Unfortunately I will probably be here till I'm old. Living like a zombie, numb. But I guess my peace just never mattered. I am just here to suffer and be guilt tripped into staying alive. The only person who respected my wishes to die is the one who died against his will and who I am in deep grief about to this day.\n\nI miss you, my sweet. I'll find you soon. Even if I have to wonder the universe for eternity. We will meet eventually. I promise. And I am sorry if I disrespected your illness and death. You know it all comes from pain because my heart got ripped out of my chest and crushed to pieces with you being gone. I hope you understand like you always did. You were the only one who did. I hope you're peaceful wherever you are. Wait for me. I will die too. Sooner or later. We'll be together. I love you.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Since I was 9 I had been being strong for my mom, being her support, making her laugh, taking care of her, etc. I only cried when  I was sure I was alone and every time I started crumbling around my father he would tell me to stop. Work harassed me til I came back to work a quick 6 days from the day of her passing.  I felt I had no chance or opportunity to just fall apart after so many years pushing to be strong. All I wanted was to just let go.   \n\n\nHolidays 2018 my at the time still new-ish partner allowed me to just let it out, knowing I had a lot pent up, she didn't speak, didn't tell me to calm down, just held me and let me go through my thing.

But I needed more of that, even though I wiped my tears and pretended to be fine the next day and every day after that. I cried some on her birthday 2/6, some more on the anniversary of her passing, and some on my birthday.

Yesterday I took a deep breath and spoke to the grief counselors at the hospice that helped us take care of my mom during her last days and asked them if it was too late to take them up on their services offer and they coordinated with me to begin some counseling sessions.

Everything was always done as a big family group. This year we lost three family members just three months apart. Grandfather, grandmother and mother...just like that these integral family members were wiped out.\n\nMy sister wants our Christmas celebrations to take place at the family home and she is trying to organise everything...In previous years I did all the Christmas prep and planning but now it\u2019s unbearable. The biggest problem is that she wants everyone to celebrate it the exact way we have every year. I asked why and her response was because memories and all that sentimental stuff...To me that just feels wrong and the opposite of moving on?\n\nI said I can\u2019t have anything to do with it. I suggested alternatives. It\u2019s bad enough that before my mother died she bought everyone their Christmas presents. I don\u2019t even know how I\u2019m going to deal with that aspect of Christmas as it is. I love my family but if I celebrate Christmas the way they want to I know it will probably be a lot of steps backwards for me.

My grandfather won\u2019t be there to don his elf hat and give out presents, grandma won\u2019t be there to flex on everyone how she got the *most* presents and my mother won\u2019t be there to spread the Christmas cheer like no one else possibly can.\n\nI believe that we need to start fresh. To make new traditions. Do something completely different. But everyone else disagrees with me on this...they kind of want to fetishise the past...\n\nIf anyone here has words of wisdom I would greatly appreciate hearing from you\u2764\ufe0f", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Sorry for letting it out here.\n\n\nI don\u2019t think this is anyone\u2019s business but I don\u2019t know how else to say it.\n\nI never really met you. On my graduation day in 2016, I physically met you for the first time. You told me you were my dad and asked for a hug, which I gave, and then offered me a check that I never felt comfortable cashing. You seemed nice but unstable- you were not legally supposed to be there, and in the end I\u2019m not sure I was supposed to see anything. I found out things about you I\u2019m not comfortable with knowing. It leaves me wondering if you died of guilt or frustration, or if I was supposed to have tried to fix the mess I was made from. I think you came that day with good intentions. Still, I was too scared to reach out. We only ever said hello. Did I contribute to this? Did you die hating the daughter you\u2019d only spoken to once? Or were you happy you met me?\n\nI want to be angry but I also want to feel compassion. I don\u2019t forgive what I know about you, but I don\u2019t wish death on you or anyone. It\u2019s so hard to think about a person you only knew through a glass window. Maybe it\u2019s selfish, but I\u2019m trying to base how you might have felt on how Ive felt. We both have bipolar, and it\u2019s the one thing I know I got from you. I\u2019ve tried to kill myself, too. It was the illness talking for my actions and my desire to die. I\u2019m really sad that you fell victim to that. I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll be the same. But I know that the thoughts, the impulse, the things it makes you think about yourself, its too much for one person. I heard you never really talked about it. My family has been here to bear it with me. I don\u2019t know who was there for you, or if they were stable. I don\u2019t think they were. I\u2019m sorry.\n\nSo I guess it\u2019s much too late, but my thoughts go out to you. I call someone else dad, but Jeremy, you should know how I\u2019m doing. I don\u2019t have much social media so there wasn\u2019t much to look for. I skipped 3rd grade, and despite my mood swings I worked hard. I graduated high school with an average GPA but I took plenty of honors classes. I got my associates of arts degree in 2018! I guess art is hereditary too. I\u2019m off to a big school to finish my education and hopefully become an animator. It\u2019s not as skillful or personal as tattoos but it\u2019s in the same ball park. I tried to do as much of it by myself as I could, I even moved across the country all by myself and paid for the 90% of the degree I have. I\u2019m a huge nerd like I heard you were, I play D&amp;D and I watch anime. I\u2019ll be 21 this month, but I\u2019m probably not going to do anything crazy since I don\u2019t drink or smoke. I\u2019m sorry you won\u2019t be here to see that, but I feel like you probably knew I would be. I\u2019m actually a little scared it\u2019s the reason you passed before November. \n\nI want you to be proud of me even if you don\u2019t know who I actually am. I don\u2019t know what you thought about me. I feel guilty that I never thought more than curiosity. I don\u2019t know where you\u2019ve gone now, but I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s someplace without stress. Maybe it\u2019s nowhere. I\u2019m too young to understand that and probably never will. Honestly I\u2019d probably be angry if someone tried to use religion to sugar coat things to me. I don\u2019t think you lived a sugar coated life. I don\u2019t know if I have siblings on your side or anything like that, but if I do I hope they were as lucky as I was. Maybe you even found a new family. I hope the people that loved you are doing well. I hope that despite the tragedy, you and those close to you lived with some kind of memory that was fond and sweet. I wish there was more I could do, but I know realistically I\u2019m just a kid with your blood and nothing else.

I\u2019m more prone to crying than anything else.. but my mother posting about it literally every day, all day is driving me insane. I know that sounds incredibly insensitive because she\u2019s grieving too. But she didn\u2019t give a crap about my sister the entire time she was alive. Stole money from her that was for college (stipends. \u201cKids needed shoes\u201d. It was 3k.), and dropped her off at college her freshman year 2 weeks early with no money or food because my other sister had to be there early. She just \u201cforgot\u201d to give her money. Bullshit...Not to mention sister was forced to go to that ultra Christian private college to begin with. She quit after a year and a half and moved in with me so she could get away from people calling her a whore. (She had tattoos and fell asleep at her boyfriends house overnight. No-no\u2019s in a Christian school) I looked out for her. I made sure she had a car for work, because I gave her mine. I helped her move into an apartment 4 hours away from me. And then a year and a half later, I helped her move into her new house with her bf. My mom didn\u2019t care to visit her even once. Not even when she was living with me, only 30mins away. Mom didn\u2019t call unless she needed something. She didn\u2019t support her. Mom didn\u2019t say she was proud of her for making her own way and being her own person. My mother hated that. My mother is a true narcissist.. She\u2019s always the victim and if there was no contact, it was the other persons fault. You don\u2019t like being smacked around? Don\u2019t be a bad kid.

Something was clearly bothering her. I asked her if anything was wrong and she said that she was just tired and cranky. Later in the morning after a few hours of work go by I text her something along the lines of \"hey, are you OK today? I just want you to know that I got you.\" to which she replies \"I feel disconnected to you and I don't really know if you got me\".  \n\n\nThis sparks a pretty intense discussion after she leaves me on 'read' all day. I tell her that I'm trying to do everything right and talk about things. I tell her that I want to be there for her and provide. I love this woman with my whole heart. She then tells me that there is a disconnect because my life is so much more different than hers; People like me. I get invited to things. My parents love each other and message me lots. My career is going very well. I get paid way more than I should, based on the current job market in my area. It can be argued that all of those points are quite the opposite for her. We left on a positive note but I'm experienced enough in relationships to know that this is definitely going to come up again.  \n\n\nHow do I level with her? How do I help? How do I not feel guilty for having a great life?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I watched him on his death bed struggling to breathe, moaning, and falling in an out of sleep. All he could eat was crushed ice and that's it. Growing up, my dad was my hero and my biggest fear was watching him die (he served for the military for 24 years). The fear was so bad I could actually just think about seeing him lifeless and I would instantly start crying. \nBefore he passed, my last words to him was \"Don't worry, dad I promise I'll be right back here first thing in the morning. I love you. \" And he didn't respond but he gave me a look before I left to go back to the hotel because visiting time was over. He passed away that night and I feel like that was the day my world ended. I stopped drawing, stopped making music, stopped reading, stopped playing video games and I picked up drinking. I was stuck in an abusive relationship and wasn't allowed to mourn. I ended up slipping into Alcoholism just to stop my brain from replaying his moans and labored breathing. To also make me forget kissing his lifeless body and telling him I love him. My mother offered no support. She was actually cussing me out as I got back on the plane to go home after he passed because she despised my dad (they split up when I was an infant and she acts like a petty teen about it) she was mad that my dad's death impacted me instead of celebrating like she was. I lost all of my friends because I was \"too emotional\" Even though they offered to be there, my abusive ex threw me to the streets after taking all my money and I ended up flirting with alcoholism because I then felt too ashamed, isolated and alone to get help for my problems. It's been a year, this week I've finally been working on my drinking and I still feel just as empty and none of my interests have returned. I find comfort in an online group because it's easier to let my problems out on the internet than to a real person face to face. Every day I think about killing myself but the fear of what happens after death stops me. The idea of there being nothing when you die makes me so sick because that means my dad is gone for forever. But at the same time, I constantly think about how we are going to all die anyway and it makes me even more sad because I worry about watching my sisters die or anyone else in my family. \nMy inbox is always open for those who need grief support, I'm always going to be an ear you need.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

In mid-July, she passed out for 36 hours and went to the ER when she woke up. She spent the next 3 days in ICU, then the next week in the hospital. She was transitioned into a \"rehab facility,\" which turned out to be a nursing home, and a really shitty one at that. She didn't have any insurance, so we were really limited on where she could go, particularly with her picc line, but I still feel so guilty because I'm the one who insisted on one of five places close to my house/work. It's because of me she ended up in a complete shit hole with terrible nurses, disgusting food, and no amenities. \n\nOn September 12, her doctor's appointment was good. She was improving and was going home soon. I went to see her on September 13, but I was in such a hurry. I just stopped by to drop things off to her before rushing home to get ready for my date. I told her where I was going and who with, and she really wanted to go to the show, too - one of her favorite operas. She looked so sad. My dating life was always of interest since I always had many men in the wings. This was the 8th or 10th time I was going out with this one, and she asked, \"So, have you decided on him?\" \"Yea, Mom, I think so...he's pretty great.\" She'll never get to meet him. \n\nThat night, he and I spent our first night together, and I didn't want anything to break our ecstasy, so I didn't talk to anyone, including my mom, all weekend. I didn't know I'd never have the chance to talk to her again. \n\nSeptember 16, I thought about stopping by to see her, but I was so tired from the shitty day at work...\"I'll go tomorrow.\" I didn't even call.\n\nSeptember 17, 3:30a, I woke up to find a missed call from the nursing home. When I called back, the nurse hurriedly told me that my mom had passed, \"sorry.\" \n\nI worked on cleaning out her house, all her many precious books and possessions. Since then, I've had this recurring nightmare that she's not really gone, and when we are reunited, she's so angry and hurt that I sold and donated all of her things. I wake up crying trying to remind myself that she's definitely gone and can't use her things now, but it doesn't help. It's been happening more and more, and more vividly. In my dreams, she's asking about specific items that I so carelessly dismissed or recognized as important and gave to a friend (tonight's dream featured a specific compact mirror she never even had a chance to use because she was \"saving\" it, and I passed it on to her best friend at the memorial). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI miss you, Mom. I'm so sorry I was always in such a hurry. You were only 66. It never occurred to me that I'd lose you so early. I thought we still had many years together. I'm so sorry I didn't come after work on Monday. I'm so sorry you'll never get to meet K. After you passed, he really stepped up to try to help me through everything. Mom, I wish you were here.

The holidays haven't been the same since, and I've stopped caring about my birthday as well (it falls just three weeks after she passed).  I've completely numbed out as a way of coping/surviving, I suppose.  I don't know if \"coping\" would be completely accurate, as I still have constant nightmares, and the coulda/woulda/shoulda is always gnawing at me.  What could I have done differently? What should I have seen? What would have happened if we'd done this instead of that?  Etc.  \n\nMy family are living their own lives and we're not terribly close.  My father died when I was a teenager, and I've no siblings.  So I'm left to sort of process this in my own way, which has been to just internalize everything and joke my way through life.  Travel when I need to run away from my feelings (especially around the holidays).\n\nFor those who operate in the same way, how do you explain to those around you that you need to be alone when being around people is sort of expected? I'm traveling abroad over Thanksgiving, and I've just booked another holiday abroad over Christmas.  I need to be in different scenery and on my own to process and I guess avoid my feelings, even though I know this deeply worries my friends and someone I've recently begun dating.

It\u2019s so hard.", "author": "kittyopuppy", "self_text": "I don\u2019t expect anyone to read this, it\u2019s just therapeutic for me to write this all out. If you do read this, thank you for hearing me ramble about this messy part of my past. Most people don\u2019t know my story. It\u2019s a lot for me to get into and I don\u2019t expect anyone to understand. I\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot lately since the holidays are approaching and it gets really hard for me around this time of year.\n\nThis Christmas will mark 2 years of her passing. I was the primary caregiver for my grandmother for nearly 3 years and I was with her during her last days. I had just turned 19 when I moved in to take care of her full time. Looking back now, that was way too much responsibility to put on someone so young, I don\u2019t know how I did it. \n\nShe had severe dementia, and with each passing month, her mental state declined. It was heartbreaking to see such a vibrant, independent, dignified lady wither away into someone who became so frail and senile. Fortunately, her personality never left her. \n\nAnd out of all of the things that she had forgotten, and all of the memories and people that she could no longer remember, she remembered me, even through the last minutes of her life. I was her \u201cbaby.\u201d My nana never called me by my first name. She always referred to me as \u201cBaby\u201d or \u201cthe baby\u201d since I was the youngest girl. That was what her parents called her, and what my grandfather called her, and she passed that name along to me when I was born.\n\nIf I hadn\u2019t have moved in to take care of her, there were two other options: my mother could have quit her job to take care of Nana and risk losing her retirement, or put Nana in a nursing home where she\u2019d be confused and scared and most likely not last very long. I know that I made the right decision with putting my life on hold to take care of my family. If I had to do it all over again, I\u2019d do it in a heartbeat. At the time though, I didn\u2019t realize how much I was sacrificing. \n\nI couldn\u2019t have a normal life. Taking care of her was my entire world. I couldn\u2019t have a normal social life, professional life, love life. I couldn\u2019t even have a normal sleep schedule. She was my full time job. Whenever I wanted to go out for an evening, I\u2019d have to get a babysitter. Looking back, it was like I was a single mother. I had so much weight to carry on my shoulders at such a tender age. I didn\u2019t get those carefree college years that most people get. I looked passed it at the time, but I\u2019m 23 now and I feel so disconnected from people my age. I cannot relate to them. While they were out playing beer pong and going to music festivals, I was changing bed pans and consoling my grandmother through her sundowning episodes/nighttime hallucinations.\n\nPart of me still really resents my parents, particularly my mother, for not helping me more. I didn\u2019t do what I did to be a martyr, I did it because I felt like it was the right thing to do. However, I felt dumped on and neglected. I was spreading myself too thin and it made my struggle with codependency even harder. It got to the point where no one in my family would even think about helping me out and giving me a break. 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, I was taking care of someone. I was physically and mentally exhausted. It took me a year and a half after she died just to adjust my sleep schedule.\n\nAs unsupportive my parents were, my uncles and aunts were 100x worse. When my grandma was in hospice, my uncle\u2019s wife cussed me out and accused me of being a gold digger. A lot of family members thought I was getting some big payout, but really, I knew I\u2019d end up with nothing and that was okay. All that mattered was that she was taken care of. The estate wasn\u2019t even a thought in my mind.\n\nMy uncle (the one with the crazy wife) inherited everything, including her house. He kicked me out two weeks after she died. I knew I had to move and was preparing myself to get out of there, but one day after coming home from the grocery store, I found everything I owned thrown out into the yard in the rain. He had literally kicked me out, no notice. That house is still vacant. He cannot find anyone to buy it. I took care of and maintained that house like it was my own. I loved that house. I cooked so many good meals in that little kitchen. I decorated that house for every holiday. I\u2019d sit on the porch swing with Nana while we\u2019d sing together and listen to the wind chimes through the breeze on summer evenings. That place was my *home* and he tossed me out like garbage. \n\nI spent the entire time I lived with her preparing myself for her death. I knew it was coming, and I knew that I\u2019d have a major life shift, but when it really happened, I felt so out of control. I was with her when she died. My sister and I held each other as we watched her take her last breath. After she had passed, the muscles in her face relaxed, and her eyes opened. They had this glazed over expression. I was so shocked seeing this, that I screamed and almost fainted. I couldn\u2019t feel my legs and I couldn\u2019t stop screaming. It was like I wasn\u2019t in control of my body. It was an awful feeling.\n\nI have been around a lot dead bodies (former mortuary assistant) but it\u2019s different when it\u2019s your family, and it\u2019s really different seeing someone die right before your eyes. My sister whisked me away outside and held me as I sobbed. When we got home, seeing all of Nana\u2019s things like her medicine and her walker, made me tremble. It was so eerie to see everything where we last left it. Her laundry in the basket, her teddy bear that always sat by her chair, her favorite snacks in the fridge that I had bought her. It scared me, it was a very harsh reminder that she was dead and none of this was to be used again. I remember my sister and I staying up all night talking, and she left the room to get something and I said \u201cplease don\u2019t leave me, I\u2019m really scared.\u201d I felt so creeped out. I can\u2019t fully describe it, but it was to most morbid feeling I\u2019ve ever felt.\n\nI was not given the luxury of time to process all of this loss at the time. I was so concerned about my finances, where I\u2019d live, and finding a job, and with the lack of emotional support from my family, I have had to put all of this grief on the back burner. Back in July, I felt that I was in a safe enough place to begin to feel what I need to feel. It\u2019s hard for me to really get over this due to my living situation. I live with my parents at the moment, and there house is right between Nana\u2019s and my psycho uncle\u2019s. So every day, I have to sit and see that house that was my home sit there, dead, vacant, a very clear reminder that she\u2019s gone and our time together is over. \n\nI miss her so much. We were so close. Losing her felt like I lost my child. Taking care of her was like taking care of a child, and I felt like I had lost a baby. I had an identity crisis after she had died because my whole life revolves around taking care of someone else. I felt like my life had lost its purpose and I had to learn how to take care of myself.\n\nI\u2019m feel so lucky to have had my special bond with her. I got time with her that no one else had, and living with her got me away from my domineering father, which helped me realize how bad growing up with him was. Taking care of her was a huge part of my development as an adult and I wouldn\u2019t trade that experience for the world.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

What about the ribbons, and the solidarity head shaving, and the #hope that the honest, hard working cancer patients of America have come to expect and deserve? It doesn't make sense that my mom was just walking around with this inside of her. For god's sake, her organs were rotting and she was *fine.* Up until she wasn't. Obviously. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFuck all of the 'what if' questions. What if she went to the hospital sooner? What if someone looked at that little pebble in her stomach more closely? What if she had insurance? Would she still be alive if she had been going to the doctor regularly? What if? What if? What if? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd you know what, mom, what the fuck were you thinking? I'm sure that during that first hospital trip, when you signed the papers and made me your medical power of attorney, you never thought I would have to use it. But I *did.* I signed the DNR. I decided when you died. I had the conversation. I was the one who had to say the words and now I have to spend the whole rest of my life living with it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpeaking of which, fuck you, dad. \"You stole her chance at a miracle,\" seriously, fuck off. Miracles are made up by people who can't accept reality long enough to give their daughter a hug after she let her mother stop *suffering.* And you know what? You and mom hated each other so goddamn much it's legendary, and I'm never gonna forget you waiting until she was on her deathbed to decide you loved her. That's a real bitch move, dad.

I wonder if they ever tell this story at their church. I wonder if they tell it to their friends, or post about it on facebook. I wonder if they ever thought about what happened to me after that. They wouldn't know, because they haven't called me. They don't return my calls. I'm not even going to ask for anything, I just want to reach out and feel like someone's there. But there isn't. There isn't. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou know, I could have gone without learning who my 'real friends' are, because turns out I didn't have any and I ended up completely alone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo I make you uncomfortable?

I would run away from this if I could. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd hey, fuck getting called 'so strong' or, worse, *'an inspiration'.* Sure, I'm super fucking inspirational.

I'm broke as shit and one unexpected expense from falling right off the fucking cliff and ain't no one gonna be there to catch me if that happens and I'm *always* scared of that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me just take a second to say fuck magical thinking. And fuck everyone with a sweet story like 'Oh, she always said she was going to be reincarnated into a songbird, and every time I hear the sparrows in the morning I know she's near'. Excuse me, I'm having my weekly crisis over whether or not I *really* believe that my mother communicates to me via license plates. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's something no one ever told me about.

Everybody dies, and not everyone is a blessed angel. Complicated people leave behind complicated messes and I'm fucking tired of shifting through the shit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have this dream sometimes. My mom just shows up, walks right through the door like nothing ever happened. And I know, I know in my mind that she's dead and dead means gone. But I just don't care. I don't care because she's *there*, right there and she wants to hug me, she's smiling and it's her voice and, well.... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA shift happens. Her smile is twisted.

I woke up on a crisp, icy November morning to learn that my grandma, \u201cGram\u201d, passed away in her sleep. With my phone off during the night, I\u2019d missed the frantic calls to the paramedic and the final, heartbreaking ER visit that the rest of my family endured. \n\nEveryone responds differently to the loss of their grandparents. Some shrug it off; the lack of closeness spares them from the sting of death. For others, and for me, the loss of a grandparent is equivalent to saying goodbye to mom or dad. I\u2019d lived with Gram for my entire life prior to getting married. Wrapping my mind around losing her - especially when I\u2019d seen her just days ago, laughing, talking, playing with my 2-year-old daughter, smiling and *living -* was nearly impossible. \n\nI don\u2019t have to detail the physical and emotional pain of grief, because if you\u2019re reading this, chances are that you\u2019ve experienced it. Whether it\u2019s the dull throb of losing a distant loved one or the soul-shattering agony of parting with a spouse or child, it can feel impossible to bear. In death, I know Gram would want me to focus on happier times, so I\u2019ll take the liberty of telling you about my wonderful grandma and what made her unique. \n\nGram was kind. Not the superficial be-nice-to-people-because-that\u2019s-what-society-expects kind, but the type of kind that welcomes in the depressed, disabled and downtrodden. My mother has battled anxiety and depression her entire life, and a devastating divorce left her homeless with three kids. Gram stepped in to help by offering her a place to live, empowering her to find a job and helping provide for my brothers and me. In Gram\u2019s final years, my mom returned the favor by being the best caretaker you can imagine. \n\nGram loved music. She was incredible pianist and a trained opera singer, and while she could never get me to practice the piano, I sang with her for years. I\u2019ll forever remember standing next to her at the piano, stumbling my way through complicated arias and attempting to sing in French, while she encouraged me to keep trying. Gram was nice but bold; if I made a mistake or tried to weasel my way out of something that was hard, she wouldn\u2019t let me get away with it! \n\nGram had a fantastic home. On the day of her passing, I sat in her large living room. Now it feels so empty, but mementos of a life well lived adorn every surface. Pictures of her dear husband, seven children and numerous grandchildren sit in mismatched dusty, frames. There are snapshots from family trips, school pictures, images of candid moments at summer barbecues and family reunions. On one shelf I find something special I made for Gram when I was 5 years old - a grainy picture of me surrounded by spray-painted macaroni and beans. 21 years later, it\u2019s a reminder of our deeply entwined roots. \n\nThe motley jumble of family photos is found among designer furniture, incredible paintings and all kinds of trinkets that could occupy a showroom. Gram loved nice things - her closet, packed to the brim with beautiful clothing, shoes and jewelry, is a testament to her taste for finery. \n\nBut Gram loved one thing above all - God. She had an ever-present faith in a higher power and a staunch belief that she\u2019d see her Heavenly Father again. That is a legacy she passed to her children, grandchildren and everyone else whose lives she touched. Personally, I\u2019ve clung to my faith and hope that Gram is in a better place and that we\u2019ll be reunited someday. But faith can only provide so many answers, and I will grieve, whether nirvana or nothingness claimed her. \n\nGoing through grief and dealing with death is rotten, plain and simple. Each day the people we love walk the tightrope between life and death; easily snuffed out by an unexpected tragedy or a pernicious disease. The sweet taste of love eventually gives way to the bitter sting of grief. \n\nIf your heart is hurting tonight please know that you\u2019re not alone - I grieve with you. And  everyone who loves will grieve, at some time and in some way. But Gram\u2019s home, with its seemingly endless photographs of friends and family, captures a fundamental truth: each moment of pain is worth enduring for a life bursting with love. \n\nThank you for letting me wax poetic about Gram tonight. I miss her so much \ud83d\udc94", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He meant the world to me. He was like a second father to me. On that very same day we also lost our dog. It was a traumatising day that I wish just could be erased from history. \n\nI graduated in June. My grandfather (and my parents) couldn\u2019t make it to my graduation so I didn\u2019t go at all. Ever since september I haven\u2019t drawn at all. Something that was such a big part of my personality is now left in a drawer, abandoned. I haven\u2019t really looked for work, especially not in the area I graduated in. Family life around here ain\u2019t great. I just feel depleted of any life source that was in me. \n\nMy uncles aren\u2019t super cool dudes like I thought. Mom told me that grandpa wanted to leave his grandchildren 25k each but my uncles don\u2019t have as much children as my parents do so they objected. And it\u2019s fine I guess. I really don\u2019t care about the money. A part of me is actually glad I don\u2019t need to think about that money and the feelings it would carry. I wish I could just have my grandpa back. But it sucks to know that my uncles are such greedy people. They basically divided everything that was in my grandparents house between the two of them. My dad doesn\u2019t like confrontation so he accepted it. \n\nThe only thing I really wanted was a knitted doll that I used to play with when I was little. My uncles already have grandchildren so I didn\u2019t get that doll. So I opted for the second thing, a large painting. It was always displayed in the living room so I would have loved to have it. Just something to look at and remember my grandfather. Well my uncle already called dibs on it. The paintings aren\u2019t worth much on the market. I think maybe 50 max? My uncle isn\u2019t really interested in art so I was surprised he wanted it. Part of me is very certain that he will just sell it... which breaks my heart. To be fair I got two small paintings that were displayed upstairs instead. They just don\u2019t really evoke the same feeling but I guess I\u2019ll take whatever I can get at this point. \n\nMy dad even said I should be grateful I would get these paintings since my uncle already called dibs. But they literally already so much. The flatscreen tv, the old standing clock, the washing machine, cutlery, vases, clothes, and so on. You name it, they got it. I wanted one thing and it was denied. My father said that he didn\u2019t know I wanted it... But that\u2019s the thing. No one ever asked us about it. We practically grew up there. My mom and dad were always working so that house was a second home. And now they all act like it was a stranger\u2019s house. I can\u2019t help that my grandparents liked us so much. My uncles hated it apparently. During the service something was mentioned that my brother, my sister and I were his beloved grandchildren. My uncles found it a bit inappropriate. But it was the fucking truth. My cousins were already teenagers when we were born... They never really had that connection with my grandparents. Hell, they never even visited him in the elderly home. And I know that for a fact. How can they be offended that my grandpa liked us more. He never was unfair in his treatment. He treated everyone with the same love and affection. Why are we pushed aside like we never even met him? They are making this whole situation unbearable. I know they lost their dad. I know that\u2019s rough. But I lost my grandpa too. I deserve to have just something of his that reminds me of him. I\u2019m literally typing this all while bawling my eyes out. I just wish they didn\u2019t make this so difficult. Is it so much too ask to have one doll or one specific painting? \n\nAnd then you have the house. My grandma is still alive. She still owns that house but because she doesn\u2019t want to live alone, she is in an eldery home. If a house is empty for too long, you have to pay some kind of fee. At first it all started as a simple favour. My brother would pretend to live there just so that my uncles and my dad wouldn\u2019t have to pay. Then it evolved in maybe letting my brother and I stay there for 300 a month. Then my sister wanted to stay there too. We went to the house to just check it out. Talk about details and stuff. \n\nIt broke my heart. It completely shattered my heart into a million pieces. The house was so empty. Every working thing or piece of value was gone. Divided between my two uncles. So my brother and I said \u201cnope I\u2019m out.\u201d Since the cost of living there would be significantly higher. My sister still wanted to live there but my dad said we all decided not to live there. Two days later my sister finds out that my dad said that. They rectify that but my uncles already had someone check out the house. They said they could get 600 a month for the house. So now the price is 600 and that does not include water, electricity or heating. 600 for just being there. Nothing more. So it went from a family favour to a cash grab. My sister still wants to live there... I would rather have them pay the fee of an empty house. Nobody would rent that house, especially not the state it\u2019s in. It\u2019s also a terrible location tbh...\n\nAt this point I\u2019m pretty sure my grief is mixing in with all the other emotions but I\u2019m crying every night, just wishing that my grandpa was still alive so that he could fix this situation. He would know what to say. What to do. Everyone respected his decisions... it wouldn\u2019t be such a mess. Sorry for such a long post and for the rambled mess that this is. It\u2019s almost 7 am.

The last time I spoke to him we had said oh we will hang out soon. \nI just couldn't stop thinking of all the good times we had growing up, beach days, parties, football games, playing call of duty, it just made me so sad to think we won\u2019t get to experience anything like that ever again. He was such a great dude; funny, nice, supportive, and it just breaks my heart that someone so great left this world so soon. It just doesn\u2019t seem fair that we get to live on while good people like him die. I\u2019m kind of just ranting but I\u2019m just sad and I\u2019m not sure how to feel.

Something went wrong and she ended up having a lot of internal bleeding which led to her falling into a coma. Unfortunately she never woke up and passed 3 days after her surgery. Even though she was older, this was very unexpected. \n\nBefore she officially passed, my boyfriend flew out to where she was hospitalized (Nevada) and stayed out there for a little over a week. During his time there, I offered to fly out there twice and he declined both times. I took that as him needing space so I didn\u2019t feel any type of way about that. \n\nSince he\u2019s been back home, things have been expectedly different then how they were before. I anticipated this because my boyfriend and his mother were extremely close. They talked on the phone almost every single day and he was really looking forward to me officially getting to meet her in person this Thanksgiving. \n\nI can tell that my boyfriend is trying to remain as positive as he can, however he has been way more irritable and a bit shut off. It\u2019s been hard for me because I feel like he takes some of his irritability out on me. I\u2019ve been trying my hardest to be patient but we\u2019ve sadly been getting into more arguments then lately. During our last argument he said some pretty hurtful things about how he feels like I haven\u2019t been there for him during this time and how it seems like I just don\u2019t care at all. \n\nThis was really hurtful because I\u2019ve never been through this with someone and so I\u2019m not really sure what to do or what he needs. Mind you, my own grandfather passed away just last month, so I\u2019ve been dealing with my own grief (not as severe as his obviously, but still hard). Is there anyone out there who has been through grief with a partner? What were some things that worked for you and your relationship? I don\u2019t want our relationship to crumble because of this, but everyday has felt like a battle!\n\nTLDR- Boyfriends mom passed away unexpectedly. We got into an argument and he said that I haven\u2019t been supportive or there for him at all. What are some things that have worked for anyone who\u2019s gone through grief with a partner?  Or if you\u2019ve gone through this personally, what kind of support did you need from your partner/spouse.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I suffer from a lot of guilt and haven\u2019t really come back from this yet. She loved cats and they were always super drawn to her. As soon as she passed I decided I\u2019d one day get another cat and name it after her, and it was just this feeling that I would find a kitty with kindred spirit. \n\nAbout 5 days ago, I found a very sociable and beautiful kitten in my apt complex in the cold at night. The kitty seems spayed, has a nice coat, so may have lived with someone/has an owner so I\u2019ve been asking around and looking on lost animal pages. Going to make a photo flyer ASAP and post it around the buildings. However , there are no signs of an owner yet and if nothing comes up I\u2019m keeping the cat. Also: this neighborhood is overrun with stray cats.\n\nSo that being said, in these 5 days I\u2019ve already bonded so much with the cat..... I named it my late friends name. Everyone in the house is referring to the cat by name and so am I. I didn\u2019t think anything of it at first but now I\u2019m starting to think naming the cat after my friend could be unhealthy? Partly because I\u2019m still looking for an owner just in case (although unlikely because there are so many strays) and because I feel I\u2019m still very much grieving. \n\nTD;LR is it wise to name a pet after a dead loved one?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

The doctors weren't sure we'll survive until Christmas, but he did for some years. Sadly, this year is where he can't. 2 months ago I paid a visit to my mom, my little brother and my step dad. My brother had a football training so my step dad and I went to see him. After the training we went back to the car, and my step dad started whizzing. We all knew he wasn't okay, he couldn't gardening, lifting heavy objects not climbing up stairs so we put him in a bedroom on 1st floor. I live with my did so I don't see my mom and all quite often, but it's always a good and peaceful moment when we do my sister and I. 2 days ago my mom called me and told me my step dad was sent to the hospital because he couldn't breathing at all. She called me back yesterday morning to ask me if I could take care of my brother but I was at University so sadly no. Hopefully my sister lives near the university so both my mom and my brother could go there to see her. Later that day I tried to do something else to bother my mind, wishing that everything would be better, but the bad news arrived. My step dad can't breathe without a specific machine. My mom told me that we can go and see him today for the last time, before the doctors put him in a coma and let him go.\nI can't realize actually, but I cried after she told me that. Like I wrote before, he was with me for around 10 years of my life (and I'm 21 so yeah, I spend almost mid of my life with him). I can't stop thinking that I won't see him anymore after today, and what would happen to my mom and my brother. I called a friend yesterday, she told me she was here for me, and I almost cried again (I'm a bit emotional, so hearing a trusted friend telling me they'll be here for me can make me cry in hard times).

He went to the ER about 6 times once by ambulance and about 10 times to urgent care. When he went in he would ask for drugs thinking it was just his Sciatic nerve flaring up. On his second to last trip to the ER he asked for an MRI. The doctor said that he didn\u2019t see the reason for it but he agreed. They found a mass on his tail bone. So they admitted him to the hospital. Where in the next couple of days they did a chest scan and found a mass in his lungs. They then did a biopsy on the mass in his lung and sent it off for testing. They started radiation on the one on his tail bone in the next couple of days before sending him home. \n\nWhen he got home he couldn\u2019t move from the couch, we tried to get him to the hospital for his treatments but he was in too much pain. After about five days of us fighting to get him to go to his treatments we settled on going to the ER where for whatever reason they decided to admit him. My dad for about 2 weeks things were going ok at least what I was told but I am sure my dad kept a lot from us. His mom came down to see him and so did one of his sisters. I think my dad was in a lot more pain then he let on to us they did a surgery to stabilize his tail bone to reduce pain and the surgeon said that his tail bone was mush. About two weeks after he was admired, The day before they were going to pull him off of 24/7 monitoring his heart stopped twice and they were able to resuscitate him and intubate him. \n\nHe was asleep for about 3 days before we started to get a response out of him. It\u2019s a little blurry what happened for that first week. But we went to see him everyday to keep track of how he was doing. More family came down to see him on Friday, his mom again, his youngest sister again, both of my sisters and their husbands and 4 of his 6 grandchildren. After seeing him they went home on Sunday and Monday they were able to extubate him and his daughters were able to talk to him, he couldn\u2019t project his voice it was more of a whisper, for a couple minutes but before my mom and I could get there they had to intubate him again. That Wednesday the doctors wanted to meet with us. We discussed his situation he had sever emphysema for a man of his age, He was fighting off pneumonia, and he had cancer that was spreading fairly quickly. They did another chest looking to see why his blood levels kept dropping and they found that his cancer had metastasized to his kidneys his diaphragm and a couple other spots. They said that even if he was able to get over his pneumonia he would have to gain back they 50lbs he had lost in the hospital because he had no markers for any targeted treatments. they said it could take 6 weeks before he got over his pneumonia and then it could take months before he was ready to do chemo and at that point with how fast the cancer was moving they weren\u2019t sure if he could do. As a family we decided that when he was ready the doctors would extubate him and if he was struggling they would move to comfort care. They extubated him either Saturday or Sunday and then he passed that Thursday. He passed that morning. After he passed we went to see him. It was one of the hardest moments in my life and I can vividly see him. He had one tear running down his face.\n\nI hope it was a tear of release and not pain. I am sad that he was alone when he passed. I miss my dad, I am sad that he passed before I got married and had kids. I am sad that my kids will never get to know the man that was my best-friend, my rock, and my hero in so many ways. I know he was not perfect, I am pissed that he smoked, I am pissed that he didn\u2019t advocate for himself sooner, and I am pissed that he didn\u2019t share more with us. I wish I could have five more minutes with him before he went into the icu so I could talk to him and hug him and just tell him I love him. I am glad his fight is over that and that wherever he is that he is at peace. I want him to know that he was a great dad who made me into the man I am today and that I am so glad that people say I am anything like him.

I need to get something off my chest that I\u2019m unable to talk about freely. \n\nI have a vivid memory. I remember as far back as 2-3 years old. My parents were great people. I was very attached to them and I slept in their bed. The happiness and love I felt in my early years is something I\u2019m incredibly grateful for. My dad was a disabled veteran. He was introverted, funny, and never once yelled at me. He eventually needed surgery on his spine. When I was 8 he was arrested the first time for prescription pills. My life took a turn for the worst in every way possible. I won\u2019t go into those details much but he would often go years in jail until I\u2019d see him again. He wouldn\u2019t be home long. The longest was a year, which would be his last year alive. By then I was an extremely depressed 14 year old with bad anxiety. I didn\u2019t understand my mental illness and my asian mom dealt with it by calling the police on me every time I couldn\u2019t force myself out of bed for school. After years of praying he could get better, I lost hope. I blamed my father greatly for the issues in my family. I didn\u2019t treat him well and I was still ignorant towards addiction. The opiates+benzos made him incredibly high and delusional constantly. He would have seizures every week and dislocate his shoulder. Often times he\u2019d seize and not remember me. I always thought drugs would take his life. When I was 15 my father was struck by a car walking home from a VA appointment after missing the bus. I had to witness my father\u2019s mutilated body. He had no life insurance and we were denied DIC pension because his death wasn\u2019t service connected. A year ago we got access to his medical records and were notified he went to the hospital that day due to a welfare check. He was suicidal and they basically discussed his reasons to live and released him. We weren\u2019t given any of that information until a year ago before a VA video hearing. I\u2019m in my early 20s now and I finally go to therapy. The trauma makes my life incredibly difficult and I fear my loved ones dying quite often. It hurts and I miss him everyday. He died at age 39. My last interaction with him was a fight. Now I do my best to love and spend as much time with my mom as possible but I\u2019m paranoid I\u2019ll lose her too. I\u2019ve discussed these topics in therapy and I do the homework but some days I still break down over it.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He went into cardiac arrest and I performed CPR on him but was unsuccessful. He had surgery done on him and didn\u2019t take it well. He went to the hospital and was released.

Told him to drink some water and get some rest. Within the hour, my grandmother called out to me, and I rushed to call 911 and performed CPR on him.

My heart tore up at the sight of my mother and my grandmother crying their hearts out. He was supposed to move to his dream apartment at the beach, and the closing date for selling the house was this week.

I lost my older brother to murder last year on July, I used to smoke 420 alot to help but I think I was delaying my grief process.

Currently I hardly feel angry but my anxiety has spiked and became an issue. I always was shy and introverted, but it was always manageable. It wasn't until recently I've noticed my anxiety has taken over. At first I though I had social anxiety, I do but I didn't let it get to it to me but I realized it's the grieving process.

We\u2019ve tried rehabs and treatment programs of all sorts. When I met him last year I just had become sober, he was 3 months sober after a week long relapse after being clean for 10 months. We had a wonderful relationship. He lifted me up during my darkest days, he saved me. All I could do in return was try and save him. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. He relapsed. I took care of him during this time. He needed to be 24+ hours into full withdrawals to get on suboxone. I took him downtown east side to get on it, they rejected because they were past the cut off point for patients yet we were there 5 hours before closing. He tried to bolt and I called a million other places and everywhere said no. I was running out of time before he bolted. Only thing I could do was let him use small amounts in order to try and get threw the night without bad withdrawals kicking in.  It was full time babysitting, couldn\u2019t go to work. Couldn\u2019t leave him alone. This was against my rules but I had no choice other then to monitor him so he wasn\u2019t at a -20 and more a -2. Long story short I went on a trip and I was paranoid and anxious as ever to leave. But after all the stress he told me to go for a few days. I came home and he was on the program, he sent verified proof and all but I just don\u2019t know what happened.\n\nCome Saturday night, I made plans with him Sunday to go get pedicures. I\u2019m exhausted and I said goodnight I\u2019m going to bed I love you. I use to get mad with him because he would call me 20 times a day.  I fucking wish he called. He texted me back saying he loved me at 9pm. He sent me a text at 1050pm saying can I call you. I didn\u2019t answer I was sleeping. So I woke up at midnight from a nightmare, sweating, completely panicked. I read the text and didn\u2019t respond. \n\nI woke up at 830am completely sick to my stomach and panicked. I had to get ahold of him. I just felt the need to more than ever. He never responded. So by 930am I set out to his house. Figured I would check on him and we can start the day early. I arrived a little after 10am. I didn\u2019t have keys to the apartment so I was banging on the door to his place. No answer. Weird, he always answered. I called him in total 17 times. Hoping he would answer and be like \u201csorry left my phone in the living room\u201d like always did. So I decided to start looking threw the windows because he always answered or woke up. So I could see the blinds were slightly cracked and I could make out feet in his bedroom. It was dark and I could see the TV was on, barely illuminating what looked like feet. So I went around to the bedroom window and I climbed over these rocks, banging on the window I was yelling his name. The neighbours told me to shut up. I didn\u2019t care. I could now see what looked like his body. So I went back to the front window and started looking for ways to get in. The window opened from the top so I got on a chair and pried it open with my fingers. I stuck my head in and ripped the blinds open. I panicked because I could see his shirtless body now laying in quite an unnatural position. I almost fell off my chair I was standing on. I started thinking okay I could climb threw the window and maybe he\u2019s sleeping from the suboxone. I don\u2019t know how this shit works and I don\u2019t know if you maybe slept deep. But the problem with the window was it would be hard to lift myself threw without smashing the whole thing and potentially hurting myself really bad. I\u2019m freaking out at this point so I decided to go straight to the landlord. I told her \u201ceither you can let me in or I\u2019m kicking the door in. Either way I\u2019m getting in\u201d(I\u2019m a professional door kicker in-er and a professional at getting arrested right after doing this). She went around to the back and fumbled her keys and took what seemed like forever to open the door. Eventually she does and I push her out of the way and run to him immediately. \n\nI grabbed him. He was cold and hard feeling. I was screaming 911 and already called it before I even knew what I was doing. I went to school to be a paramedic but didn\u2019t do the second part of it. I know the steps in what to do. I threw my phone on the bed, I told them we need advanced life support and the address. I realized at that time his hands were what looked reptile like. He was extremely white. And he had his arms folded under him and his head turned to the side looking at the tv. I fucking knew what was happened by the look of his hands at this point. I grabbed his face screaming \u201c Zac ZAC ZAAAC wake up, wake the fuck up\u201d but as I turned his head to look at me I noticed a lot of blood on the bed from his mouth and his face was paper white. I quickly grabbed him and he\u2019s already a 230 pound guy but he felt like a million pounds. I flipped him over, he still remained in the arms crossed position and I flipped him off the side of the bed and onto the ground. When I did this I noticed way more blood, now on me, and just everywhere. He was all swollen and the blood pooled to the low points so he almost was like a dark purple black in certain areas of his chest and face. I was going to start CPR and naloxone him but I got off my knees on the ground and I left the apartment. I knew you couldn\u2019t bring him back. CPR was going to do anything. Nothing was. He was in the same position he was laying in when he died but now on the ground and on the back and I couldn\u2019t move his arms by his side. \n\nAt this point I\u2019m now outside in the street having a full blown melt down in the pissing rain. These guys in a car stopped and said what\u2019s going on. I screamed \u201cmy boyfriends dead, don\u2019t even go in there\u201d and they went in and quickly came out, clearly horrified on what they saw. I just remember being in the street with water rushing at me from the top of the hill and it was raining crazy. I was just stuck on the street and the police grabbed me and put me in an ambulance. I saw the fire fighters go in and come out.... advanced care go in and come out.... They all were walking towards me. I\u2019m hysterical. The police officer hugged me and said she\u2019s sorry for my loss. I asked every single person on scene... \u201care you sure he\u2019s dead\u201d. I already knew when I saw him he was. But I couldn\u2019t grasp it. Coroners came, site clean up and all that arrived. I asked them too. Victim services came and I told them \u201cI think you need to double check, he might not be. \n\nFast forward to today. 5 days since I found him. I\u2019m empty and feel like a bag of shit. I should have stayed with him. The coroner predicts he died at midnight or as late as 2am. Fentanyl was the cause of death. Fucking fentanyl. I have had friends and family all come by my place. I have roughly $1000 in flowers in my place. But I still feel alone. I wear his clothes to bed every night. I cry uncontrollably. I feel alone. I feel fucking so alone.  I had a trip to Vegas I gave a ticket away to someone else. I barely can leave my house. I can\u2019t eat right and when I do I want straight sugar. I can\u2019t sleep. I can\u2019t function. I\u2019ve lost the man I love so unconditionally and so much. I\u2019m a poet and I\u2019ve been keeping a journal near by to right down these lines I come up with and my feelings constantly.

I\u2019m on a rollercoaster. I feel like I can\u2019t ever move on without him. His love was so bold and true. I can always share pieces I\u2019ve written about him. if people are interested.

It was really sudden and I'm trying to navigate the grief that I'm feeling...\n\nI'm 31 this year and by all accounts I'd consider this to be relatively young, generally speaking, to lose a parent. My mom wasn't necessarily young either (67) but she was in good health and just retired so she was due for some good relaxation and retired living... My family was never well off but my parents worked hard and saved money, raised me to a point where I'm married, have my own house and can support myself and so the plan was always for them to enjoy their retirement savings (and I'd even pitch in to help them with that as well).\n\nSomething I keep coming up against in my head in this grieving process is that I feel like my mom was 'cheated' out of what would have been the best years of her life. My wife and I don't have kids, but we have plans to (and are/were actively trying). I feel like as a parent, with adult children, there are things you should be able to experience or enjoy as a mother (or grandmother) and I'm just so sad that my mom is unable to experience these things. It pains me to think that she worked until she was 65, grinding out a living for her family (not to say she didn't live a happy life either), but that only two years into her retirement, all of that was taken away from her.\n\nI feel so indebted to my mom, and since it's so fresh, everything I see, even just similarly aged people, remind me of her.

He had suffered from mental health and substance abuse issues for more than a decade. My dad went to check on him and found him. That's when October 24th became the worst day of all of our lives.\n\nMy grief is compounded by guilt. While my brother and I were not exactly estranged, we were not close. I hadn't talked to him since May. The last time I spoke with him was to confront him about his behavior at my wedding (which was the last time I saw him). The conversation ended well, and the last thing we said to each other was that we loved one another. I so regret not calling or trying to see him in the months that followed. I was still resentful, and I think part of me was trying to avoid the chaos that he sometimes brought into my family's life. Because we had been distant for a long, long time (not entirely because of the drugs and mental health issues; we had always been very different), I think was also just used to not communicating with him. Part of me feels like I don't deserve to be as sad as I am because of our distant relationship. I hope he knew that I loved him so much- the fact that we were not close did not change that.\n\nMy grief is also compounded by unanswered questions. We don't yet know how he died. We think it was an accidental overdose but we won't find out for another month or so. My worst fear is that the medical examiner will conclude that he intentionally took his own life. The last interaction my parents had with him was to kick him out of their home because he was high all day. I don't blame them at all for this, but I'm terrified they will blame themselves for what happened. They did literally everything they could over the years- they have been the absolute best parents to both of us. It's not their fault.\n\nAnother unanswered question is why my brother was never able to recover from his mental health and substance abuse issues. In 2015 he got into a detox program, moved back to my hometown, and was able to quit using heroin with the help of suboxone. That was a huge accomplishment, and I was so proud of him. But then he became addicted to benzodiazepenes. He was also never able to fully give up alcohol and marijuana. There were stretches of time he seemed almost back to normal, and then the bottom would fall out. He was smart, and he was loved and supported. Why couldn't he get better when other people, many of whom did not have the same advantages he did, can? \n\nI feel like my heart breaks everyday. My mom said she wished she had been there when he died. I was initially disturbed by this, but now I wish I had been there, too. As awful as it would have been, I wish we could have all held him while he passed away to make sure he knew he was loved.\n\nI hope it gets easier to adapt to our new reality. I have been back at home (in another state) and at work for a couple weeks. Sometimes it feels good to accomplish things, but most days I feel like I am just going through the motions. I see a therapist, who has been great, but obviously grief is a process. \n\nAny insights or non-judgmental support would be appreciated.

My Dad Won't Leave My Dreams.", "author": "Creak17", "self_text": "First, some background information:\n\nIt's been 136 days since my Dad passed away suddenly from Ketoacidosis with ethanol abuse as a contributory. He used alcohol to fall asleep and had severe depression, but he was sober for a bit and working on getting help. His apartment was a mess, but he always promised he would clean it, so me (20F) and my brother (16) tried not bother him and clean what he would let us do (he felt bad and wouldn't let us clean). His death has brought so many problems. Since my parents are divorced, I had to be in charge of everything. With help from family, we held his funeral and because of weather, the next day (my birthday) we buried him. When I went to clean his apartment, there was empty alcohol containers everywhere, which was not there when I had last saw him. My Dad didn't have a will or any paperwork in order, so it took forever to get money pay bills. I did hire a lawyer, but he either doesn't have motivation to work or he doesn't know what he is doing. I don't know if the government or companies are going to come after me for his large debts.\n\nSo, on to my issue. My Dad has been plaguing my dreams ever since he died. While I don't remember every dream, I know he was there. Most of the dreams have him surviving or somehow coming back to life. In these dreams, I hang out with him and try to rationalize what happened. Usually, he's living in the same condition he was in when he died and I get upset with him about it while he sees no issue. Other dreams, I know he's dead and I just sit with him. Many times he comforts me and other times we talk. For an example, I was talking to him about how I'm struggling in college and thinking about dropping out, which I am thinking about in real life. He agreed with me.\n\nThese dreams are really affecting me. I have a hard time getting up in the morning, due to the dread I feel and my pain from fibromyalgia (which has worsened ever since he left) and I've missed classes because of this. I'm now super forgetful, which also affects my school and family life. I was diagnosed with depression before my Dad died, but now it is worse. I'm also no longer wanting to do things I used to love, like play video games, since my Dad helped me become the nerd I am today. I've been working on getting help, but hospitals and insurance like to take their sweet time and I can't afford much. Most of my family has been supportive though.\n\nSo, I'm posting here today to 1. Vent my story and 2. ask questions. Are having constant dreams of my Dad normal? Is there a way to lessen these dreams, or at least make them not so traumatic?

I still can't believe it. She was one of those people that was larger than life, with a smile and a laugh ready for anyone. She loved deeply and had relationships with people all over the world. I'm the kind of person who has only a few deep relationships, and I considered her one of them. But the past couple of years have been hard for me mental health wise - I struggled with a long period of social anxiety that alienated me from everyone except my then-boyfriend, or people I saw in person. I rarely connected online or by phone with anyone, no matter how close. It strained a lot of my relationships, but they still carried on. I've been working a lot to improve that lately.\n\nNow that she's gone, so many people are sharing how much they loved her. I know she had a really close group of friends that she travelled with and saw frequently. It makes me feel insecure in what we had - we had a friendship that was just the two of us, not really part of any bigger group. They have seen her a lot more and a lot more frequently than me, all documented on social media. I have to trust that the friendship I had with her is as strong as I know it to be. I had been meaning to reach out to her soon to plan to travel to her city - something we do every one or two years, since we live halfway across the country from one another. But now it won't happen.\n\nI feel like a terrible friend. I hope that she knows how much I loved her, how much I will miss her, how important she was in my life.

I\u2019ve posted here before and got a lot of support and figured I\u2019d try again since I\u2019m going through a rough time right now.\n\n\n\n\nI just have one specific memory bouncing around in my head.\n\nI was about 4th grade, maybe 5th (10 or 11 years old I think,) by then. But I remember cheerleading tryouts coming up and my grandma (my court appointed guardian) wouldn't let me do it. She wouldn't let me do dance. She wouldn't let me do gymnastics. Nothing. No extracurriculars. \n\nAnd then I'd go to my moms, and this was back when she'd actually spend time with us, and she'd be cooking dinner and I'd be sitting at the bar drinking a mini can of soda, and i asked her, \"mom?if I lived with you, would you let me do cheerleading?\" And she told me \"why of course I would, Kierstin. I would let you do any sport or activity you wanted and I would support you.\" \n\nAnd I said \"well, why can't I live with you?\" And she told me that my grandma wouldn't allow it. And that I could make that decision when I turned 14. And I counted down the years until I turned 14, and I pleaded and begged and even ran away from my grandmothers so I could live with my mom. \n\nBut by that point in my life (14-15,)my mom was uninterested in me living with her at that point, even though TJ, her boyfriend at the time had a bedroom set up for me, I had everything I needed to live there from visiting and he would beg my mom to take me back and she just wouldn't. And I just think about all of that a lot. I know things were good with her at one point and it's so, god damn painful, it literally knocks the wind out of my chest to know that there was a moment in my mother's life that she stopped fighting for me, she decided she no longer wanted to support my dreams of being a dancer or a cheerleader, or any dreams that I would have as I grew up. She decided she no longer wanted to wrap Christmas presents for Bradley and I to open every year, that she didn't want to make us home cooked meals and have movie nights on the couch, or rewatch the first episode of South Park over and over, laughing at \"don't kick the baby,\" and I just wonder what I did so wrong to not deserve losing a fairly normal motherly relationship. \n\nAnd then I got tired of feeling as if my mother stopped caring about me and I stopped talking to her for three years. I got married on April 18, and she texted me happy birthday on the 27th, saying that she loved me. And I didn\u2019t say it back because I was guarded. We made plans to have dinner on May 5th, so she could meet my husband, her son in law. \n\nShe suddenly passed away on May 3rd of undetected Coronary Artery Disease, 2 days before I was supposed to see her. I had, so many questions that I wanted answers too. I wanted to tell her about her grandchild growing inside of me, that couldn\u2019t survive due to the shock I felt when she died.

(Panic-inducing flashbacks)", "author": "vizualdestroyer", "self_text": "I'm currently at work having a panic attack and not sure how to go about this.\n\nMy father passed away last month after a very brief battle with cancer (diagnosed May this year). He was always strict about his diet and only got more stubborn as his cancer got worse. Towards the last few weeks he refused to eat almost anything. A week before he died I was able to convince him to get chemo, then a few days later to get a feeding tube put in. Despite already being Stage IV, this is when he started to get incredibly worse, before passing away exactly a week after his first chemotherapy session.\n\nWhile I know it had to be done, and that I was only trying to give him a fighting chance, I have so much guilt. It often feels like I am solely responsible for killing him. With that said, the guilt can be managed. The thing I struggle with is the constant flashbacks of him at his worst. I hate these images because it's hard to even recognise how that person in the hospital bed was my best friend.\n\nI know guilt is a normal response when grieving, but gosh that doesn't do anything to make it easier.

We had lived together as roommates for the last five years of her life.  She was my friend, greatest cheerleader, roommate, and the best human being I\u2019ve ever known.  She stayed by my side, kept a roof over my head during my seven year battle with drug addiction.  Those were the toughest, most tumultuous years of my life and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine the pain and hurt she endured just trying to keep me alive.  In fact, I got clean when in February of 2010 I was kicked out of my older sisters house and she decided she was going with me.  That night as we sat on the side of her bed, she held my hands and said \u201cBubba.  You have to stop now.  You have to.  Please.  We won\u2019t survive if you don\u2019t.  I\u2019ll die.\u201d  With those words, I, almost overnight, put drugs behind me and began to move forward with my life. \n\nIn July of 2018, because of a Facebook post I made in support of my (M38) best friend (M23) and his then boyfriend, as well as the greater LGTBQ community, we, my best friend and I, were fired from our positions within the  local catholic diocese - I as a music director and he as my associate director.   This same month I slipped into the worst depression I\u2019d ever experienced.  I finally began to grieve the giant all-encompassing loss of my mom.  Between that grief, and the grief over losing my job, I slipped into the worst depression I\u2019d ever experienced.  (I was diagnosed as Bipolar in 2004).  \n\nIn August of 2018, I relapsed.  \n\nIn December 2018, I tried to commit suicide.  My roommate - who was up until the previous month my girlfriend and fianc\u00e9e - was woken up by the sound of our dogs barking hysterically.  I had miscalculated the time it would take for me to become unconscious and, rather than peacefully slipping away in the bed upstairs, I collapsed into the floor and began to convulse.  My body hitting the floor is what startled our dogs, who with their unusually loud barking, woke my fianc\u00e9e from a deep sleep, and ultimately saved my life.   I continued to relapse after my attempt.\n\nFinally, in February of 2019, my best friend, my very best friend in the whole world, committed suicide. \n\nI had  slowly begun to process my moms death, bounce back from being fired for the first time in my life, dealing with the consequences of my relapse, and attempted suicide, when J killed himself.  Our friendship had a unique dynamic in that we first met when he was a 15 year old student and I was a 30 year old music teacher, though it wouldn\u2019t be until after he turned 21 that we would become friends.  So when I say our dynamic was unique, it was because I looked at him as my son, younger brother, and lifelong friend.  \n\nAll of that to say this.  I am stuck in the mud, in neutral, unable to move forward with my life.  I\u2019ve seen the same psychiatrist and therapist regularly off and on since my 2004 Bipolar diagnoses, I take psych meds, am working on rebuilding my relationship with my once fianc\u00e9e turned roommate.  I am stuck.  I don\u2019t know how to move forward.  I don\u2019t know that I even want to anymore.  I\u2019m just taking up space, converting oxygen into carbon dioxide.  I miss my mom, my best friend, my career.  My roommate/former fianc\u00e9e has BEEN.  MY.  ROCK.  but I am no longer attached to the idea of life.  I\u2019ve heard all the usual platitudes, but nothing helps.  I have an apathy towards life I\u2019ve never had.  I feel like I\u2019m still spiraling, lost, hurting and sad.  \n\nNot sure what I hope will come of this post, but thank you for your time.

Although we primarily focus on Dungeons &amp; Dragons, other tabletop roleplaying game characters are welcome.\n\nThis formal offer is the least I can do for a subreddit that has helped equip me with empathetic communication skills. Our sub was founded because a redditor u/SomeHairyGuy (Laurence) posted to the larger D&amp;D community when he was terminally ill, asking if his character could be put into official D&amp;D adventures somehow. That character, a Wizard named Galder, was included in published adventures. Since then we've grown to include many adventurers who belonged to players who will be missed dearly.\n\nOur subreddit accepts characters of players who have passed away. So if you feel this would help with the grieving process of friends of the deceased, just know that the offer is here. Content warning; brief mention of suicide.&gt;! I was hesitant to post because I want to be cautious not to encourage suicidal individuals to submit their characters.!&lt; Hopefully, this post has a message clear enough for folks relatively unfamiliar with the games themselves. If seeing the characters who meant so much to your loved one continue their adventures at other gaming tables would provide catharsis, please feel free to post in r/AdventuresOfGalder or contact the mods their for guidance.\n\nWarm thanks to this sub for listening.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Too many toxins in her blood from her kidneys and liver not working right. There was apparently a tumor in her stomach area as well but she wasn't healthy enough for a biopsy to take place. My heart has been broken and I've been trying to find my usual sense of humor again. She was also the other half of my crafting business, and now I don't feel like making anything and vending without her. So I'm taking a break from vending next year. She passed the day after what would have been her three year wedding anniversary. I need to reach out to her husband but I'm just having a hard time reaching out to anyone. She was amazing and talented and we were very similar in how our minds thought of things (aka our minds were in the gutter 24/7). We met at a workplace we both worked for. And once we met, we were pretty inseparable. She was one of the people I talked to all the time and it's been lonely without her to chat with.  \n\n\nAnd then last night, one of my oldest, best friend/sister, passed away last night. We met at summer camp a long time ago  (somewhere in the 90's) and kept being friends after that. When she came home from college, she'd drive down to visit me. Once, when I was in High School, I was trying to get my letter jacket by being a Manager on our female sports teams. I got to go with on their Christmas trip to a show and a certain theme park about 30 minutes away from where I live. I had a good time but was kind of lonely - I didn't really get along with a lot of those kids. We were supposed to pair up and I was kind of leftover. Well, I got the okay to wander by myself and at one point in the theme park, I heard a familiar voice and it was her and her family there, enjoying the Christmas lights &amp; decorations. I ended up spending the rest of that trip with her and her family and had a wonderful time. I went camping with them once to the lake - went out on their boat and everything. Got the worst sunburn I'd ever had while I was out there, and the camper had the AC blasting, so goosebumps + sunburn were no fun, but I had the best time with her family. I ended up hooking her up with a guy friend that we consider each other siblings, so it was a weird clash of worlds but it was a good choice. They ended up not staying together but they were a cute couple. I let him know this morning that she had passed last night. I also let my first husband know, because we'd spend time with her when she'd come home from teaching English in Japan.  \n\n\nTheir deaths happened a month and a day from each other, and I just want to curl up somewhere and cry, but I know if I do, it'll trigger a migraine.

The past 12 months have been absolutely unbelievable and I think her story is very inspiring so I need to tell it.\n\nLast November she took her dog out for a walk near her home and slipped on black ice.  She fell flat on her back and our lives were never the same.  The fall broke one of her vertebra and and severed her spinal cord.  She was instantly a paraplegic from the chest down at the age of 70.\n\nShe was airlifted to hospital and the neurosurgeons did the best they could to repair the damage.  They saved her life, but they also discovered the reason the fall had such a catastrophic impact - she had metastatic cancer growing in the vertebra that shattered.  The Dr. described it like an egg shell.  When she fell, the impact basically crushed the bone and subsequently severed the spinal cord. She was given 12 months to live with the type of cancer she had. \n\nOne would think that becoming paralyzed at age 70 with a terminal cancer diagnosis on top of that would send the best of us into despair.  Not her - she said screw the cancer, I'm going to walk again.   She never complained once and she just decided to get on with it.  \n\nShe would need months of rehabilitation and physio therapy to regain any sort of independence or mobility.  She was in a rehabilitation facility for 3 months straight and worked her butt off, learning to transfer from bed to wheelchair to commode etc.  She had to relearn how us use a shower and a toilet.  How to get in and out of a car.  All the things we take for granted and she didn't care about the looming terminal cancer.  She felt well, so she worked her butt off every single day to get to the point where she could go home and regain independence and dignity.  That's exactly what she did.  I renovated her home and made it wheelchair accessible and she moved home last March.  She blew everyone away.\n\nMy Dad passed from cancer in 2015 and it was devastating for my Mom.  She was a nurse and she took care of him during his last months.  She was just getting over his passing and really starting to enjoy her life when she had the accident that paralyzed her.  Life just ins't fair sometimes is it?  She'd slap me right now...\"When life gives you lemons..\" she'd say.\n\nMy Mom had 8 really good months at home after her accident.  It was really challenging for her, but she did her best every day to make her life worth living.  She inspired us all with her gumption and her tenacity.  I did everything I could to help her over the last year.  I renovated her home, took her to Drs visits, brought her out for dinners with my kids etc.\n\nAbout 6 weeks ago she started having pain in her back.  We went to her Dr. and they gave her a CT scan.  It was bad news.  The cancer was hitting her with a vengeance and it wasn't going to get better.  She took this in stride, but was obviously a bit defeated.  \"I so wanted to be able to walk again\" she'd say.\n\nAfter seeing what Dad went through in 2015 with his cancer, Mom wanted nothing to do with it.  She wanted to go out on her own terms.  She decided to use the medically assisted dying program.  She chose a date and got signoff from her Docs.  It was very difficult for us all, but its what she wanted.  We were all with her when she gently slipped away.  She looked at us all calmly and said \"take care of each other and keep smiling\".  Now she is out of pain and with my Dad.  That's what I believe anyway.\n\nI'm in a lot of pain right now with her passing, but I know it will heal with time.  Such a wonderful mother and so strong.

I didn\u2019t exactly grow up with the best childhood. From living in drug houses, on the streets, in hotels, or staying with a kid from school for a couple of nights I was never used to stability. I have moved school many time due to getting a new foster home, being in a girls home, or living with my bio family. When I was little I was diagnosed with adhd and anger issues. Shortly following those diagnoses my bio mom was told I had many signs of manic depression other known as bipolar disorder but because I was so young they didn\u2019t want to diagnose me with anything further, in case I grew out of it. Also because those medical records will follow me forever. With that being said it can make it harder to get into certain colleges and get certain jobs this being because they wouldn\u2019t want me to hurt anyone else. I was later diagnosed with manic, psychotic, major, and chemical depression. I wasn\u2019t aware I could be diagnosed with so many different types depressions (I wasn\u2019t even aware there was more than one kind). If that wasn\u2019t bad enough it was later found that I have generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder. Just when I thought that I couldn\u2019t be anymore messed up in the head, after many warning signs, a physiologist was worried about me having schizophrenia. I guess at 12 you shouldn\u2019t have delusions/ or hallucinations of bad things and say that it\u2019s okay cause their your friends. I argued to that man saying he was wrong, that they were real. After a breakdown of me screaming at him to stop calling me \u201ccrazy\u201d and telling me that \u201cthey are watching me\u201d I was diagnosed with schizophrenia. I blame most of my issues on my bio mom. Maybe if she wasn\u2019t doing hard drugs while pregnant with me, I might be a little more normal. To be fair she didn\u2019t know she was pregnant right away, but when she found out and told the man who I should call my father, he disappeared leaving my mom alone, pregnant with me and to cracked out to make good decisions. My mom wanted an abortion but her sister wouldn\u2019t let her. My mother didn\u2019t care if I lived or died, so she continued to make the bad choices that I think affect me today. Her sister took care of me until I was 1 but gave me back because she had her own kids to deal with (which I\u2019m not mad about). So my mom just took me along to all of her little drug trips... Then she didn\u2019t want me anymore.  When people think of foster homes they think of kind helping people but that\u2019s not always the case. Not many people care enough to find out what happens in these homes though. I was later put into foster care at the age of 9. My mom ended up going to rehab because she wanted to get better for me but until then I had to bounce back between foster homes who only wanted the pay check most of the time. My mom left rehab and continued her ways. I\u2019m not going to lie and say I was an angel child because I wasn\u2019t. A lot of the times when I had to change homes it was my fault. Fighting kids and running away from the homes was my only option to get away from the physical, verbal, mental, and sexual abuse I went through. Because of my \u201cbad behavior\u201d I was put in a girls home. Until my mom showed up clean wanting me back. My mom proved to them she could take care of me. That didn\u2019t last long though. Before I knew it my mom was leaving me at a strangers house because she got a new boyfriend. This stranger she left me with was an older woman and she lived with her older brother and sister. Staying with them was horrible, I wasn\u2019t being fed, I was being screamed at and beatin and I had to earn my stay by doing whatever they wanted. After a failed suicide attempt I was back in the hospital where I was officially put back into foster care. I had to continue staying with those awful people. The state ended up making the brother move out because he had two charges for beating kids. Little did the state know the sisters weren\u2019t much better. I was later taken out of there custody after they tried to beat me to death. I wish I could say that things got better after that. but the thing that broke me the most is what comes next. My sisters death. She was in a good place with loving people who took care of her. she died at the age of 13 from an asthma attack. She is my bff and I love her very much. There is way more to be said about the awful things that have happened in my past but now I\u2019m supposed to be in my \u201cforever home\u201d. Oh wait how can it be a forever home when they won\u2019t even adopt you. They are keeping you until they don\u2019t want you anymore. Same as everyone else. The people I\u2019m with now are great don\u2019t get me wrong. I just don\u2019t think I can handle living in a house where I\u2019m still being screamed at, I get in trouble for being mentally unstable, and most of the time they think my triggers from my ptsd are funny. When a male raises his voice at me I breakdown in tears, out of habit. When there is sudden movement near me I flinch, out of habit. I get in trouble for things like this. But what can you expect from a teenage girl who was raped by many different men, almost beaten to death, held at gun point, partially deaf because she was beat in the head with a metal baseball bat, a girl who has had 9 failed suicide attempts, a girl who was locked in a basement for days at a time given dog food and a bowl of water and had to wear a dogs collar around her neck because she was a \u201cbad girl\u201d.  I\u2019m often scared of stupid sounds most people don\u2019t even acknowledge. All because of the things I have been through. The man that made me pretend I was a dog used to blow whistles at me before he\u2019d beat me, so I\u2019m now scared of whistles. The woman who kept 6 of us foster kids in a single room with one bed would made a smoothie every morning before we had to help her with her \u201cfavors\u201d, so I\u2019m now terrified of blenders. Funny story, I hate getting my haircut because one of the woman that fostered me was upset that I was a girl. I wasn\u2019t aware she wanted a boy so bad that she would cut my hair and make me wear boys clothes. This is the life that I lived and every single time I close my eyes I start to see it happening all over again. My flashbacks have been getting worse. I\u2019ve been through so many coping mechanism, I have talked to so many therapists, I have been put on meds to try and help... but I can\u2019t unsee, I can\u2019t unhear, and I definitely can\u2019t unlive the things from my past.

I know that raw searing pain that eats at your soul and I'm so fucking thankful I have moved past that first stage of grieving but every once in a while that pain comes rushing back and I'm overwhelmed. I know tonight is going to hurt and tomorrow is going to hurt like a motherfucker. Thanksgiving was the first holiday we got to enjoy without her ex husband and it was so pure and lovely and nothing can recreate that experience. And she loved holidays. My sister would go all out for every holiday. When we went in her room I swear she had at least one decoration for every holiday up and it was March. \n\nI hate holidays. I hate these days.

She spent the last year of her life in a rehab and then a nursing home and desperately wanted to go back home. She suffered from macular degeneration which made her mostly blind in the end, but it was dehydration and lack of food at the nursing home that ultimately took her from us. \nI was her oldest grandchild and we had a very special relationship because of that. She was my primary babysitter too so I spent a lot of time with her when I was growing up. \n\nI didn\u2019t visit as much as I should have when she was in the home.

I know that we made the right decision for our cat, but I can\u2019t stop struggling with guilt and feelings of regret anyways.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, we started to notice that our cat was hiding, avoiding food, and generally just acting different from how he usually does. We called multiple vet clinics around our city that night to ask if it sounded like he needed to be taken into the animal hospital right away, and the general consensus was that we should hold on until morning to see if his health and behavior improves.\n\nWhen we woke up yesterday (Wednesday), we didn\u2019t feel like he had gotten better so we scheduled to take him into the vet right away. At the clinic, they told us that his condition was serious enough that he would need to be taken to the hospital, and we went right away.\n\nOur cat was severely dehydrated, losing lucidity, and losing body temperature. The hospital discovered that he had developed diabetes and was going into ketosis; his liver and pancreas were both failing in addition.\n\nThe hospital offered a number of different treatment plans, such as transferring our cat to another hospital two hours away or keeping him over night on a fluids and insulin IV drip with scheduled feeding times. Even if our cat would have recovered from the IV treatment, he would live with diabetes for the rest of his life and require the appropriate treatment.\n\nKnowing our cat, we knew this would not improve his quality of life at all. He hates traveling, strangers, and he\u2019s super finicky. Clipping his nails was always a challenge, and if we even pet him in the wrong direction he\u2019d get mad at us (he was a drama queen, haha\u2764\ufe0f). \n\nI also have Type 1 Diabetes, and my diabetes management can be so frustrating, painful, and isolating at times, and this is with a clear understanding of what the disease is and why treatment is necessary. We didn\u2019t think our cat would understand anything besides feeling anxious and pain over shots, hate dieting, etc.\n\nI stayed in the room and gave him chin scratches as they euthanized him. I really hope that he felt loved until the very end, but I can\u2019t help but worry that he thinks we gave up on him. Or feel guilty for not realizing that he was sick earlier to treat him. Thinking about the one and a half days (or even more) that he spent hungry, cold, alone, and dehydrated kills me, even though I know we never would have let this happen if we had just known.\n\nI\u2019m just really struggling.

Perhaps to provide insight, to show people that have experienced this, that it does get better? To have some strange diary to reflect on one day, maybe to continue these updates. It's a weird thing I have this need to do, so here we are.\n\nIt's been strange. . .but probably the most eye-opening time ever in my life. The blanket isn't tight anymore. This strange infliction I believed I was branded with is no longer a scab, but a scar in its own right. In a way, I've made peace with it. I understand that there was nothing I could do. That things do indeed happen for a reason. . .as cliche as that is. . .but to hear that isn't quite enough. You need to feel what that means deep in your core. \n\nI've become faithful, more in ties with spirituality. I've never believed in god, but I align myself with believing to better yourself and heal yourself deep down inside. Only you can do that. If you truly want to feel better, maybe try some meditation. It's hard at times, but it has helped me significantly. \n\nI've finally got a good job by applying myself and working hard against my depression, anxiety, and grief. Which for me is truly a grand accomplishment. I would like to be making more, doing more. . .but I'm in a better place then I was a year ago and that's what matters. \n\nSurround yourself with people who are genuine and cut out those who aren't. It's not easy, and I have lost around 20 friends this year. Primarily online writing friends, but, they were at times closer than the ones I have in person. I don't regret my choice. Life is peaceful. No drama and that is so important. You cannot heal in the same place that makes you sick, as they say. \n\nI grew distant from family to work on myself. . .and it is another one of the most important things you can do for yourself. If you need time, **take it**. They will be there for you when you are ready and if they aren't, you will find people who are. Don't turn a blind eye to true love and compassion. It will make things better, but only when you are ready for it. \n\nEverything will be okay, least I think so for once in my life. I'm so curious about what life will bring to me, and I'm excited to see what happens once I truly soar. I've been considering writing a book about my life. I want to help people? Perhaps bring an inkling of hope to those still lost in this dark storm. \n\n\\--\n\n[First Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/832k69/the_loss_of_my_mother/)  \n[Second Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/awoz4j/almost_a_year_since_my_last_post/)", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I don't know how he died exactly, but it happened slowly and I should have taken the signs more seriously. My dog's name was Manali, and he was with me since he was 2 months old, and he was still growing when he passed in front of my eyes.  \n\n\n One morning he didn't want to walk further after his morning pee, so we turned around and headed home. he jumped up the stairs to the front door and collapsed right in front of the door. I tried CPR but it was useless.  \n\n\nHe was an outdoor/indoor dog. I let him be wild and leash-less outside as we live in a mountainous rural area. One night Manali came home from one of his adventures waaaay later than normal and absolutely exhausted. I checked him over for any wounds, found nothing, and then gave him lots of water and food before bed. At the time I guessed that he had just lost his way going somewhere new and had some trouble getting back in the dark. He was tired from the long mountain journey... and he stayed tired like that for 3 whole days before starting to perk up again. Then there was an okay-ish-week where I wasn't worried because I stupidly thought he had stopped begging and digging holes just because he was maturing.. not because he conserving energy. Then the last week Manali slowly became quiet too, no whining or barking. When he started breathing heavy, I called the nearest vet (hour and half drive) and made an appointment the next day... but then my friends gave some terrible reviews of the vet and I decided to cancel.   \n\n\nI let another week pass before calling in a vet that does home visits. The Vet visited the night before Manali died and gave him a B12 injection. I found the injection done sloppily and now I wonder if it might have actually quickened his end... but I'll never know.   \n\n\nI'll never know what happened to Manali... and I'll always believe I could have prevented it somehow by acting quicker. He was such a good dog. One time he had a run-in with a leopard and got away. He used to ride on motorcycles as a puppy and loved it. I really thought that I had at least another 10 years with this friend of mine. I imagine now that something happened to him that day he came home late, somehow disrupting his internal organs. In my mind,  I'm caught in a web of ways it might have happened... but I don't think I'll ever know. \n\n I would like to have my own child someday, but now I am really doubting my ability to care properly for them. Like, shouldn't my instincts have told me that Manali was near death? I really never thought it would come to that like this.\n\nAnyways, I really needed to get that off my chest in writing...   \nIn the comments, I'm open to opinions of what might have happened to Manali...  even though I should probably let it go... also any suggestions on how to deal with grief is greatly appreciated.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

It was a beautiful service, the priest had a really nice speech, it was hymns that grandmother had chosen and beautiful music that was preformed and chosen by people who knew her. \n\nIt was the first really beautiful winter day of the season, cold and crisp air and the sun shining on us. The whole family with all the cousins and everybody\u2019s loved ones was there and we supported each other. \n\nIt was beautiful but it was also hell. It\u2019s weird and I can\u2019t still really understand that she\u2019s gone, she who always have been there. \nI kept it together pretty well most of the time. When amazing grace was sung there wasn\u2019t that many who could hold back the tears, when the priest talked about some of the charming oddities that she did or said we laughed and cried. Then the singer started singing the song that was sung at my dads funeral and I broke. It\u2019s this really beautiful song and it\u2019s a song that will forever be death and funeral for me. It was that kind of body shaking, ugly crying that just wouldn\u2019t stop. But I tried to keep as quiet as possible to not embarrass myself, silly I know. \n\nAnd then when I could breath again we were walking out in the beautiful winter day to say our last goodbye at the grave she got to share with grandfather, just a few meters away is the grave of their son, my dad. We put the roses down in the grave and then moved inside to a beautiful memorial. \n\nWe ate and talked and laughed and the room were just filled with love and warmth. For grandmother and for each other. We went to light candles on the graves of everybody near and dear to us. Then ended the day in the best way possible, dinner with family and a quite competitive game night that was filled with laughter. \n\n\nFor everybody having to go trough loosing a loved one I just want to give the biggest hug and send my love your way. It\u2019s not easy but we do it, we cry, we laugh, we remember and we love each other.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I figured I\u2019d just sit there, it would be over, and I\u2019d go back to sitting and thinking about everyone I miss.\n\nI actually really enjoyed most of the movie and especially the song \u201cThe Next Right Thing\u201d by Kristen Bell\u2019s character, Anna.  It made me start thinking that I should try to apply the same thinking to my life.  Just do the next right thing one step at a time.  No thinking about the future anymore and how I have no one.  Just be present and brush my teeth.  Then brush my hair.  Breathe.  Just try to take things little by little until maybe it becomes okay again.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My mother, sister, and I got in the car to drive to my other sister\u2019s house for Thanksgiving. Something about the day didn\u2019t feel right and the intense rain didn\u2019t help lighten the mood. After 10 minutes of being on the road my mother got a phone call. Not knowing the number, she let the call go to voicemail and we all listened to it on the car speakers. It was the hospital calling in regards to my grandfather being admitted with no details on why he was admitted. The worst part of this was the fact we were given no information on my grandmother.\n\nOut of shock, we quickly called my sister to tell her to drive to the hospital to see what happened while we tried our best to drive over in the hour and a half of traffic. My mom couldn\u2019t handle the stress of not being given information and not hearing back from my sister about the situation, but I think being left in the dark by the medical professionals helped us survive the drive.\n\nWe pulled up to the hospital and quickly ran through the doors and up to the fourth floor where my sister told us to meet her. When we told the front desk we were there to see my grandfather, the most daunting sentence came into my ears.\n\n\u201cGrief counseling is through the double doors to your left.\u201d\n\nMy mother\u2019s eyes started to welt and we got to the entrance of the counseling room where my sister was waiting with tears in her eyes. We sat down in the room and we were greeted by a social worker and a CHP officer. The first thing we heard from them was that my grandfather is down the hall, but my mom had to ask.\n\n\u201cWhere is my mother?\u201d\n\nAfter a second of silence she realized why they were quiet. The last thing my mother said before going hysterical and weeping were, \u201cNana\u2019s dead?\u201d.\n\nWhen I heard my mom answer her own question, I froze. Everyone of my siblings and my mother couldn\u2019t contain their tears and pain, but I was frozen in place. Everything in my body gave up on functioning and I was just a hollow shell with no emotion or purpose. I shed tears but I wasn\u2019t sobbing, and I hate myself for having that disconnection from my sadness. But, the day only got worse. My mother asked what had happened to my grandparents.\n\nOn the drive to my sister\u2019s house, my grandparents car hydroplaned. Their car spun out into the median where an ambulance was parked, helping another car accident, when the passenger\u2019s side slammed into the corner of the ambulance. My grandmother was in that passenger seat where she was struck and died instantaneously. My grandfather was lucky enough to survive the crash with some broken fingers, ribs, cracked sternum, and a lesion on the back of the skull.\n\nHearing this brought me back to the moment we were living in. All I could think of was the physical and mental state was left in, and all I wanted right there was to comfort him for every second I could go on living. Going to his room in the hospital was the worst feeling in the world. The second he made eye contact with us, he lost control and could not stop crying from the guilt of being the driver. This man was the father in my childhood after mine passed away when I was only two years old, and he cried with the thoughts of us despising him. At that very moment I broke down, this was someone I have loved endlessly and he believed that every part of that accident had become his fault. All I could feel was intense sadness for him to the point where I wanted to drop out of college and be with him for every last second I have in this life because I know he will eat himself to the core with guilt. And even now, all I want is to protect him from his hate and pain. But what I want more than anything is to have had the perfect goodbye for my grandmother.\n\nI wish I could\u2019ve put the effort to have visited her more often. I wish I could\u2019ve hugged her one more time and to feel her unconditional love from those hugs. I wish I could have told her all the new stories I have from this semester of school. I wish I could feel her hand caressing me as I cuddle against her. I wish I could hear her voice telling me of all the new cooking shows she wants to watch with me. I wish I could walk into her house with the smell of her cooking lingering through the air. I wish my last conversation with her was in person and not over the phone. I wish I could be with her right now just talking through the night about her future great-grandchildren. I wish I could have had one last goodbye in person where I could express how much I love her and how much she means to me.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

But i just wanna get this out. Not a lot of my friends are supporting me and find the whole thing too depressing to talk about even though i need someone to talk to. So monday the 25th was my 18th birthday. The night before i had a panic attack for a while about death. No reason really, it just happens to me sometimes but this time it was intense. For some reason i was terrified of being 18 and even counted down til 12 am like it was new years. So i go to sleep, wake up and start my day. Im just in bed for a while, then i decide i should be happy because its my birthday and im finally an adult. Right when i start getting excited and trying to boost my spirits, one of my friends posts on their snapchat story a bunch of pictures of my friend D. (Im a girl, D is a boy). At first im thinking \"he just misses him\" because he moved to another state this year. Then i see the last post. Its a long paragraph and i can barely even read it before i just know something is wrong. Still thinking maybe he just misses him, i text D. No answer. Hasnt wished me a happy birthday which is really strange since we met on my 16th birthday so he knows what day it is. Hasnt opened my streak picture from much earlier. I text my friends that dont really know D (but they know who he is because i talk about him all the time) and i start freaking out and saying he might be dead and theyre saying no youre crazy. I go read the post again and i read it clearly and finish it. I go to D's facebook and people have been posting RIP. I google his name and there it is. Fatal car crash around 5 am. He was either going to or from work. His co worker who was driving also died. I dont really know why im writing so much. I guess i havent really got to tell the full story to anyone. Ive been crying every day. The 1st 2 days it was non stop and screaming. I have never ever felt this amount of pain in my life. And heres the thing too; i fucking loved him. We wanted to be together but because he moved so far we put it off. I always said when im 18 ill come up to visit you because ill have my license, and then he would also always say when youre 18 you gotta come asap. So im 18 for 5 hours and hes gone. Just fucking gone. My world is so shattered. And when im telling you i have never met a more positive person in my life, its so true about him. He was hurting on the inside, we talked about it sometimes. But he was always so full of positive energy despite everything that hes been through. Ive hardly eaten anything this whole week. Thanksgiving i had the dinner and thats it, i had very small portions and had to choke it down. Ive thrown up when i tried to eat before this. Im sure a lot of you know the pain, its indescribable. I still am waiting for him to wake up. Im questioning my beliefs and everything i thought i knew about life and death. I dont understand why him and i never will. He was such a genuinely good soul. He was 19. I dont want to say his name or anything too personal because i 1. Dont really want anyone that knew him to find out that we were more than friends because idk if hed want that and 2. I still wanna protect his privacy. But if you look up the little bit of info ive provided im sure you could figure out who he was. But yeah idk. Idek what im saying. I just need to get this out. It hurts so bad. I keep listening to 27 by MGK. He loved MGK and he loved that song. It breaks my heart. This whole thing is so fucking awful. I wake up every day shaking and crying and filled with anxiety. I just want him to wake up. I cant accept that hes really just gone forever. Im not really christian, im not really anything. I wish i did believe in a god and a heaven. It would make this so much easier. But i really dont know about an afterlife. I sit here and i talk to him all day telling him i love him and im so sorry. I feel like im talking to the wall. I even sat here with a candle lit and talked to that, hoping that when it freaked out and started moving a lot that it was him answering. Granted, it really did only move after i said something but like 10 seconds later. So its possible it was him but i really do not know and im not getting my hopes up. I just want to have one last conversation with him. Idk how to deal with this. The only other person ive lost is my grammy, whos funeral i went to when i was like 4 or 5 and all i remember is crying the entire time because i didnt understand how she was dead. I always knew i wouldnt be able to handle death well, but i never ever predicted id have to deal with it this early in my life. Im sorry this is so long, if youve read it all thank you. I really dont know what the fuck to do. Everything reminds me of him because we were so similar. Another 2 songs ive been listening to are \"lose one friend\" and \"car crash\" both by hotel books. If youre in a similar situation to the title of those, it honestly does help a little. Makes me cry a lot but it gives me some sort of closure. From \"lose one friend\", it says \"ive wrestled with the idea of taking your place, but if anyone deserves a break from this world of pain, its you, its not me\". That one line really does make me realize he was too good for this world. D lost someone really close to him last year. He did talk about dying a lot and said in songs he made that he wanted to die but i really dont think he did. Obviously this wasnt suicide, he wasnt even driving. But he didnt wear a seatbelt. And theres so many little things that if they changed he would still be here. I have such a long list. It sucks so bad. Im sorry this is kind of all over the place, like i said just need to get a lot of this out. Thank you for listening whoever you are. Im open to literally any suggestions. I feel like im completely drowning at this point and i dont know what to do. I get my license at 11 am today. Its 3:31 am and i really should go to sleep but i really cant. Again, thank you for reading if you did. Any religious suggestions or anything at all, id really appreciate. I would say im agnostic at this point but yeah, im down to have hope in anything at all.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He took antibiotics and he was fine afterwards, but obviously the cancer was still present.\n\nHe made it to the 5 month mark. His cancer only got really bad in October, and the tumor on his nose grew a lot. Even if he's still very sick, he can still walk and play, but not too much. He's always hungry. He barks. He has trouble sleeping, which is a sign that his quality of life is not as great as it was before. \n\nI don't want to put him down but we have to. I know I'm going to miss him a lot.
