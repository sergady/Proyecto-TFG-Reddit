She passed away at school, her college to be exact. She had goals and a nursing major she was working hard on. She was 21. \n\nShe also was born with a genetic metabolic disorder, we never got the chance to officially diagnose her but she had a light form of Mucopolysaccharidosis. (We figured this out because my younger sibling has the same condition, they strangely look identical at this point. ) this condition resulted in her having to get a brain shunt that drained excess brain fluid into the stomach. This was also what I think was the cause of her death. She fell at school and the shunt disconnected and she fell into a coma and never woke up. This affected me tremendously. It\u2019s been years and it still feels like I have a gaping hole in my chest. I never got to say goodbye. I saw her getting ready for school in the morning and she asked me to help her button her jacket up because it was cold Monday morning in February and she turned around, her long ponytail swinging behind her, leaving me behind. The next time I saw her she was a porcelain doll in a casket. My parents decided to disconnect her without even telling me or my younger siblings what had happened. She was brain dead, but everyday I wonder what would have happened if we had kept her body connected for a little longer. I was in school when it happened.

I've known her most of my life as she worked at my nursery and primary school and I only met my friend when we attended high school together. She had cancer about ten years ago which was apparently so serious the doctors didn't think she'd recover but she went into remission until about 2017, in which it came back and spread to the point they told her she wouldn't recover but could live another few years with treatment. She has been getting frailer and has been undergoing chemotherapy but overall she has still been getting out and about.\n\nObviously we all knew her illness was severe but I don't think anyone expected her to pass this soon. I haven't asked my friend about it because I know it's the last thing she'll want to talk about right now but we'd made plans to meet up tomorrow which she wouldn't have done if she'd suspected her mother was close to the end. \n\nMy friend's father died when she was very young (not sure what age, I never wanted to ask her about it) but she has three older siblings and several aunts/uncles. She lives in a flat of her own and is very self-sufficient therefore housing/finances won't be a worry for her. \n\nAlthough I've experienced a lot of loss in my life I'm fortunate enough to have both parents still alive and I can't even begin to imagine what she's going through. Even though it's somewhat expected, I doubt you can prepare yourself for something like that. My friend has also had a hard time this summer as her pet rabbit died so she was already grieving and now this has happened too. \n\nBasically, I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on what I could do to support my friend and her family through this difficult time. She isn't really one to accept help but I want to make sure she has everything she needs without stepping on anyone's toes. I'm not really great at emotional stuff bc of mental issues but I want to support her.

When she moved out of my parents house she would have me at her apartment on the weekend for sleepovers. I loved every moment. When she had her first kid I was only 10 years old. When he was born my whole world changed. I felt like I had a responsibility to be the best aunt I could be.  I babysat all the time and he loved me so much. My sister went on to have 3 more kids after that and with each one I grew a new bond with that means more to me than anyone else in my life. They lived only 10 minutes away from me so I helped and babysat whenever I could.

Just the idea of working that position is so odd to me. How long before they got the job did they decide they wanted that position? I can't imagine kids growing up wanting to be a security guard, much less at a hospital.\n\nThere were two security guards there the night my brother died. Both were young, somewhere in their 20's, but older than him. They chatted to each other a bit but otherwise just stood or sat around. Used their phones. Nodded briefly at whoever walked in. For some reason, one moved just outside the room my brother was in while we waited for the news. He kept checking his Twitter. But when the doctor came to talk to us, he just had to cash in on that obscene curiosity and glance up at us while we registered the fact I'd just lost my only brother and my divorced parents' oldest son. I hadn't even seen my mom and dad together since his high school graduation.\n\nI wonder if that's why he took the job. To see people at their most vulnerable; to witness life-change on a regular basis. Lace up his boots, clock in, and sit five feet adjacent while I begin to experience the most profound loss of likely the rest of my life. I wonder if he has a sense of pride. Maybe he feels he's helping by working at an ER. Maybe he feels guilty. It's such a weird job, he does that every night. People dying with in 100 feet of him constantly, and he isn't even doing anything. Sitting in that stupid plastic chair. I wonder how many times he's heard the Code Blue. We heard it six times in those four hours, all for my brother. He even spoke to us on the way out. \"Sorry for your loss.\" He was the first to say it. And I wonder just how many times he says it in a week. How many people heard those words for the first time, from him? Has he had to hear those words? If not, he can't even begin to fathom the altercations concerned with the loss of the person whom you're closest with. We'd been making music together for years, movies and videos for longer. Not only was he my older brother, he was the only solid role model I had, my best friend, an amazing teacher, and an invaluable creative partner.

He kept saying things like, \"It doesn't make sense. He's so young.\" Like we didn't know it already. And Los Angeles is supposed to have some of the best hospitals in the country. The closest one just happened to be the one with flickering lights, where homeless drug addicts go to ride off their final highs.

I\u2019m a little sad, but almost never sad enough to cry; more just like shed a small tear like you would if you saw a sad story about a dog online. Then that\u2019s it. No real sadness at the funeral other than the empathy for other people who are grief stricken.\n\nI lost 4 family members this past year, each about two months apart, and 3 of the 4 were extended family members I did know my whole life and love. The 4th death was difficult in a different way because it was an estranged family member that brought up different emotional issues. \n\nBut after each of these deaths, I felt what could be called very emotionally muted. Both happiness and sadness weren\u2019t really present even in daily life for about a year, then all of the sudden emotion hit me like a brick wall, my old eating disorder came back up, and I started having suicidal thoughts and I was basically extremely emotionally unstable for a couple of months. After some therapy for the eating disorder, I\u2019ve been relatively back to normal for like 6 months which is great.\n\nI am also the type of person when something very serious is happening (ie a person has a seizure in front of me) I have no real reaction to it, and can do things like very matter-of-factly call 911 or stabilize the person.

Thought I would share it here.", "author": "GummieLindsays", "self_text": "Grandma Marilyn had a huge influence in my life. She was always there for me at any given moment in time. In fact, she was there for all of us. Especially during the hardest parts. We were very blessed to have her in our life. I know she will be someone who will always be irreplaceable in my heart.\n\nGrandma Marilyn was a very funny woman, she had a great personality. One of my favorite jokes she'd always say to me growing up was, \"Balls, balls, said the Queen. If I had two, I'd be King\". I'll never forget that joke, and I will carry it with me and share it with anyone who needs a good laugh. Grandma Marilyn was one of a kind, I've never met anyone else like her. She was a very spunky, humorous, loving, sharing, and kind woman. Though, one of her best qualities she had was her mental strength. No matter what hardships she faced, she was able to conquer all of them. She was a walking miracle after her major brain hemorrhage around 20 years ago.\n\nI will always cherish the memories I shared with Grandma. From the earliest memories growing up as a little kid, to the ones from the last time I was able to see her. \n\nAs a little kid, I'll never forget her butterfly magnets she had on her fridge, and how I was fascinated with how pretty they were. I remember how, over time, she decided to give them to me because I loved them so much. And before she had her stroke, I'll never forget the beanie baby toys she had at her apartment for us grandchildren to play with anytime we went over there to spend the night. I'll never forget her cat named cricket, and I'll also never forget that large sea shell she always had sitting on the floor next to her chair. \n\nWhen I got older, I looked even more forward to staying the night at her place. We would always watch Animal Planet together, and when the Crocodile Hunter aired on TV, she would prop her legs up and watch it with me. We would also go to the local community building in her small senior apartment complex, and we would work on puzzles together all the time. Sometimes we would go on a walk to Braums, just around the corner, and get an ice cream together too. She would even save her juices that she'd get from Meals on Wheels, just so she could share them with me.\n\nI'll never forget her somewhat obsession with chickens and roosters either. And I'll never forget how she would do her shopping through Avon brochures, and brochures of other companies, picking us all something out to give to each of us every year. \n\nWhen I became an adult and moved away from Oklahoma, there was a time in my life that I didn't make enough from my job. I ended up being put on food stamps because I couldn't afford to buy food while living on my own. One of the biggest acts of kindness anyone has ever done for me, was my grandma would mail me $20 a month for about a year, just to help me out. She even told me to treat myself to a movie sometime, or go do something fun with a friend. To me, that money coming from her meant more than anything. She helped me out with what little she had, because she didn't want to see me struggle. She had the biggest heart anyone could ever imagine.\n\nShe always treated us to the small meaningful things in life. Even though she didn't have a whole lot in life, she lived her life like she did. And with what little bit she had, she always made a way to share with us or help us out. I know she really loved us deeply from the bottom of her heart. \n\nI wish she was still around with us right now, but in good health, because I wish I could ask her for advice on how to get through the really hard times in life. But at the same time I'm glad she has moved onto the next life without the pain of suffering that she endured for many years. I really loved her a lot, and I miss her so much. I wish I had been able to be there for her when she needed us the most.\n\nThank you Grandma for being an important influence in my life. I love you and I miss you dearly. I hope to be a great woman like how you were some day.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Both of them died from lung cancer. \n\nWhen I first got the news that my grandma passed, I didn't feel anything at all. I think it's easier when you expect it to be coming any day. I didn't even cry until we went to her house and I saw her body. It is the worst thing to see someone who you've only ever known as a living, full of life thing, and then to see and feel their body, cold, empty, and void of the colorful person they once were. After I saw her I couldn't stop crying. \n\nNow that my grandpa passed, I still don't feel anything. It's harder because he lives across the country and I can't remember the last time I saw him in person, though I called him a lot. It really hasn't had a direct impact on my life... it's just hard to know that he's not over there living his life anymore. I can never call him again. \n\nI miss my grandparents so much. There's so much I think about now that I wish I could still tell them or things I want to ask them. It's empty knowing they're not there, at the head of our family anymore. \n\nBut I'm not exactly devastated. Is that okay? I feel more sad for my parents losing their parents than I do for losing my grandparents. And I'm still very sad, don't get me wrong. It's just complicated and hard to explain. I feel so powerless against death. I feel like mourning doesn't do me much good. It's just a fact of life. It was inevitable. It's still painful, but there is nothing I can do to make this go away, so it feels like the only thing I should do is focus on my own life and my family's lives more. I wish nothing more than to have one last phone call with my grandpa, just to tell him how much I love him. But since that can't happen, what else should I do besides move on?

Of course they should approach my husband first because his loss is much more earth-shattering than mine; he grew up with her and shared things with her that someone outside the household never would know, he lost a direct link to his family and childhood and personal history that I know is so much more than I lost.

I\u2019m sitting in a pitch black room and counting, \u201c1, 2, 3... 22, 23, 24..\u201d I\u2019m counting the seconds between his breaths. I\u2019m waiting for the sun to come up because I need to tell his wife, Nancy, .. Tell Meaghan, Sean, SOMEONE, that the time between each breath has doubled since I first sat down. Every time I hear his labored inhale I exhale my own breath because each time I\u2019m just so sure that it might not happen it again. \n\nNancy is in the doorway, she and Meg are up, it\u2019s only 5:45a or so. I tell Nancy about Dad\u2019s breathing and she listens for a minute or two and then she\u2019s in the kitchen calling my Aunt Sheila. Aunt Sheila is on the way and before I know it she\u2019s coming in through the garage door. We need to call the hospice nurse, she says, and we do. I remember a week prior when my dad told the home hospice intake person that his prognosis didn\u2019t really matter, yet. Nancy had to pull the lady aside to tell her what the prognosis was before she left; \u201ca few weeks, to a few months.\u201d \n\nHospice is there within the hour, I think Sean is still sleeping, he was up with Dad, counting breaths, until maybe 4a. The lady from hospice says \u201cit\u2019s going to happen today, call whoever needs to say goodbye.\u201d\n\nI remember Aunt Sheila looking at me and saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to call Mom.\u201d\n\nGrandma Susie shows up, she always looks well, maybe that\u2019s generational. She wasn\u2019t well, though. There was a navy chair in the corner of the room, facing my dad. She sat there most of the day, expressionless.\n\nPeople were coming by once word travelled. The pastor that married Dad and Nancy was in the kitchen most of the day, I think. He brought food. I remember my Uncle Mark showing up. I remember my Aunt Cathy coming in and I remember her ex-husband (and one of my dad\u2019s best-friends), Barry coming in. All of the goodbyes were heartbreaking. There were a couple of guys from his work, they were brief. \n\nMeaghan, Sean and I are on our knees beside his hospital bed in the middle of the living room. The floor was hard on my knees and it hurt. Meaghan spoke, where Sean and I couldn\u2019t seem to muster up a peep. \u201cYou\u2019re the best Daddy we ever could have asked for. You gave us such a good life. We love you so much. You gave us the BEST life.\u201d She repeated those words like a mantra all day long. \n\nHe opened his eyes and he looked at us, his three children, looking up at him from the side of his bed, I could see the pain in his eyes. Not from the cancer. It was because he realized he was dying and he wasn\u2019t ready. He closed his eyes and a few single tears trickled down his cheeks and then he was gone again. This happened every hour or so, almost all day. \n\nMore people are in saying their goodbyes. You can feel the heaviness in the room. \n\nIt\u2019s early evening and suddenly Dad is awake, he asks if we can turn the Cardinals game on. It\u2019s the first words he\u2019s spoken all day. We\u2019re confused but we do it, and for the first time all day people start chatting, eating, laughing even. I watch my dad from the corner of the room and he\u2019s not watching the game, he\u2019s watching us. His family. He seems so so sad. The game isn\u2019t on for very long, I don\u2019t think. He\u2019s tired and wants to lay down again and so we turn the TV off.\n\nIt\u2019s time. \n\n\n\nHis breathing is labored.\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re standing around him. I\u2019m at his bed, Meaghan and Sean are, too. Nancy. Aunt Sheila. I think my grandmother must be.\nHe squeezes my hand.\n\u201cWhat is it, Dad?\u201d\n\u201cSit me up.\u201d He says\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cSIT ME UP.\u201d And he\u2019s pulling on my hand, so we do sit him up. We\u2019re holding him and his weight is heavy. He can\u2019t breathe. \nOh god, it\u2019s happening. I don\u2019t know how to describe the sound of it but I THINK that I know his lungs are filling up with fluid. He can\u2019t breathe.\n\nHE CAN\u2019T BREATHE. \nThen, he doesn\u2019t breathe. \n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s it. It\u2019s over. We hold him sitting up for a while and we cry. We\u2019re going through this together and we\u2019re also going through it apart.\n\nI\u2019m the first person to walk away, I run to his master bathroom and I throw up. It\u2019s all stomach acid and vile. \n\nI go outside and I call Samm, I tell her \u201cit\u2019s happened\u201d and she\u2019s there within minutes. We sit outside, up against the side of her car in the driveway and wait for the coroner. I smoke a cigarette and wonder what kind of monster smokes immediately after cancer kills their dad.\n\nAll the sudden our neighbor, Chery, is coming across the yard. Meaghan and Sean are outside too and Chery is crying, she\u2019s on the phone with our mom and to it she says \u201cI\u2019ve got them, Beck, I\u2019ve got them.\u201d And she grabs all three of us up in a bear hug and we all cry. \n\nAbby comes outside, too. I sit in the driveway; Samm is on one side of me and Abby is on the other. People are showing up, even though it\u2019s late. So many cars, so many people. Is this always what happens when someone dies? At some point Samm and I go to the Redbird Express to pick up a couple of cases of beer, because all these people might need something to drink?? Nancy\u2019s dad, tells me that drinking beer is not what we need right now and in my mind I tell him to fuck off but I also nod my head at him and when he goes inside, I cry. Am I doing this wrong?\n\nI never go back into the house while my Dad\u2019s body is in there. The coroner finally shows up and I cry and Samm holds me. I plug my ears and bury my head but I still hear them carry my Dad\u2019s lifeless body out to their van, there is some clanking and doors are shutting. The engine starts and they\u2019re gone. He\u2019s gone. \n\nWhen I go back inside, Nancy\u2019s sister is cleaning, feverishly. She says that\u2019s what she does with nervous energy and then bitches that the coroner took my Dad\u2019s sleeping pills because we probably could\u2019ve used some of those tonight. There\u2019s a rose on the empty hospital bed in the living room. \n\nSamm wonders if I\u2019d like to come sleep at her house that night, and I do want to. Grams and Poppy had stayed awake waiting for us and as soon as we walk through the door Grams stands up and says \u201cOh honey\u201d and she hugs me really tight. I wonder if people really do know how much I\u2019m hurting, because it seems like they do?\n\nI go to sleep that night in Samm\u2019s bedroom, the boom box radio is playing like it did when we were kids.

My fianc\u00e9e and I took my teenage kids funeral clothes shopping:  my son (13) was being real difficult but We finally got a decent outfit, for my daughter (14) we keep looking.  We go to Miami in 2 weeks for the funeral:  the cremation was Friday and that was not an easy day.\n\nYesterday we went to an amusement park:  mom always said that life goes on, so we are doing that.

For whatever reason my mother is doing perfectly well, thank you, and I feel like she's trying to expedite some things. She wanted to clean out his closet a few weeks ago but I asked that she hold off until after the funeral because to me it's wrong to get rid of things like that before you even say goodbye. She agreed.\n\nLast week she was supposed to do it I think on Tuesday or Wednesday. The funeral was Sunday and inurnment Monday. She didn't get around to it. I left town Thursday and got back Sunday afternoon. I told her this and she sent me a text Saturday saying she was cleaning out his closet Sunday. I then told her I expected to be back around noon. At noon she told me she was going out for lunch and I said I was running late and wouldn't be home until 4.\n\nI ended up not going over there at 4 because I'd just gotten home and was tired. But she cleaned it up anyway. She called me when she was done asking if I wanted anything (I'd mentioned I wanted a particular sweater) and I said yes, but please wait. I guess my brother was ready to take it all to Goodwill right then. We got in a fight. She basically didn't want to hold onto it any longer. Said it was \"clutter\" in her entryway. Then when I asked why she didn't keep it in his bedroom (she didn't share with him) she said she didn't want it there either. Cue irrational fighting as my mother doesn't know how to deal with stress and I'm pretty sure my brother pressured her into dumping it that night so she wouldn't have to as he would do it for her. But she agreed to hold onto it so long as I picked it up that night to donate myself later. I could hear my brother in the background with his tone of \"this is bullshit, stop wasting my time.\"\n\nI couldn't do it. I cried and cried. I didn't want to see his empty closet. Mostly I didn't want to accept donating his clothes because only living people need clothes and to donate them means he's not alive. He's not coming home. He'll never need his clothes again.\n\nWhen I was still living with him I gave him guff all the time about his outfit choices. He basically wore the same things: solid color polo shirts, usually red, blue, and yellow. They were paired with jeans mostly but he also wore shorts. I gave him a hard time because his shirts were faded in color or his outfits wouldn't match. He would always sigh if we were going out and I expressed dislike for his clothing choices.\n\nI cried about never seeing him in those outfits again. Never being able to ask him what he thinks he's wearing. He had multiple shirts of the same color and I don't know how to decide which to keep. It seems like he always wore red but *which* red shirt when he had 5? I cried for what seemed like at least 30m. My heart breaks for these memories and never being able to do it again. I want my dad back. I don't want his death to be real.\n\nI can't do it. I had to go to my mom's because she was cat sitting and didn't want the cat anymore. I had to look for the cat. She was particularly fond of my dad's bed so I had to go in there to see his empty closet and all those trash bags full of his clothes sitting on his bed. It didn't hurt as much as I thought. I got it all out at home before I went over there.\n\nI told my mom I can't do it. I asked if she could have the clothes a few more days. I said I can't accept that he's not coming home. Without my brother around I don't think she felt as much stress. She said yes. But she tried to argue that *she's* the one giving his clothes away, not me. I feel differently if I have to put them in my car and donate them myself, not her. I think she's distancing herself. The flowers she's been getting smell nice but why do we only have flowers when people die?\n\nThat was long. Thank you for reading. Big steps like this solidify the reality of the situation and it hurts so much. I know his clothes will go away eventually but god I feel like every time someone dies we rush things. My mother lives alone now and I don't see reason to push everything of his out already. But also I don't want to accept his death as permanent. I want him back.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

His substance abuse (following his car accident and prescribed opiates) had changed us both, and neither of us knew the right thing to do. So I moved out, started law school and he promised to get help and come back to me as the man I fell in love with (or in his words, \"the man I deserved\"). He was the strongest person I knew and I never doubted he would be back in my arms one day -even when his habit was costing him hundreds of dollars a week, he still worked full time and was working towards his MBA- Sadly, that's not how things went and a few years later, he died of an overdose. We had kept in touch, but only sporadically as he would stop talking to everyone when he was using and his addiction only worsened. When he died I felt like I wasn't allowed to mourn him. He wasn't my boyfriend anymore, he was never my fianc\u00e9, only a handful of people even knew he had bought the ring, my family just saw him as a druggie by then, and so much time had passed. It's been five years since he died and part of me hates myself for allowing him to continue to be such a big part of my heart and thoughts. I still feel like I'm not allowed to talk to anyone about my grief because of how much time has gone by. It's like I lived with my love for him on pause for years and when he died, the weight of the loss was greater than the feelings I had outwardly showed regarding him to anyone, and it felt unwelcomed.

We roughly been dating for 3yrs and 2 months she was from the Philippines I\u2019ve finally settled my finical problems out to where I could go see her next month for a week. That\u2019s the short of it. I bought tickets already to China to connect to the Philippines. I\u2019m unsure what to do I\u2019ve been crying all weekend she passed on the 3rd of August. I\u2019ve spoken to her family and friends she  passed in an area where she she did not want me to go near due to high rate of kidnapping and. Murder of foreign people by rebel fighters. She left behind a 2 yr old son which I\u2019ve come to adore as he were my own child and I want to go visit him but I\u2019d want to go see her burial site as well. My family says it\u2019s not a good idea to travel there due to the state of that part of the country.  I can understand that and her family has implied the same when I asked. I called the airline to see if they could change the date to this month to see what the cost would be and it\u2019s insanely expensive. So I\u2019ve come to terms I won\u2019t be able to go this month anyway. But I think it\u2019s just me wanting to be there for her son more then anything else. I\u2019m not sure what to do. \n\n\nFull story- so 4 yrs ago I was on a dating site and met her we hit it. Off became good friends she was still in college we\u2019d Skype chat on fb daily she introduced me to her friends and dorm mates. We talked daily spend hours speaking she was very bright and smart and out going aswell  couldn\u2019t tell you a negative thing about her if I tried well okay her self confidence was lacking but I would always encourage her to do her best. So come 6months of chatting she suddenly stopped speaking to me. I\u2019d message her and ask her if everything was okay and all that stuff. Come 2 weeks later she told me she was pregnant from her ex and that she was going to marry him but she didn\u2019t love him. So obviously I was pissed and I pointed out that if she didn\u2019t love him not to marry him. She came to find out that his condition to marry was to abort the child. And she wasn\u2019t going to let that happen so she decided to cut ties with him after that . We kept speaking and she was depressed obviously worried about dealing with the pregnancy alone and finishing her classes before the baby was due . So I told her that I was in love with her and I\u2019d support anything she decided to do and the smiles she had on her face was one I\u2019d never forget fast forward 8 months later she brought her brother from Provence to Manila to get his life started in the city and help her out while she was pregnant. Month later she was giving birth to a beautiful baby boy. Through out her first 6-9 months she stayed in Manila running a shop out of her apartment building to cover for her expenses. She felt overwhelmed and wanted to go back to her Provence to have a break so i encouraged to do so she\u2019d have her brothers and mother to help while she decided what to do. So what I expected to be a month trip ended up turning into two years of living there she didn\u2019t like it but really didn\u2019t have a choice she wasn\u2019t able to find work so she ran the family store for the first year come last month she finally got a job at the mall a few towns over from home she got up at 4am to get ready and commute to work and she would get out at 5-7 o\u2019clock and commute 1-2 hrs home . So she just started the job I told her I was able to get a week off to go see her and she was so excited then she recalled someone telling her that they don\u2019t allow days off unless you been there for a year already . So I told her just ask and find out it was 12pm there and 12am where I live and I went to bed so I wake up getting ready for work and I read her messages from earlier that morning while I was asleep and she had basically explained her whole life story to everyone in the locker room while speaking to her boss she was crying because everybody knew all her life story between me and her and her son and his father not wanting him and they gave her 5 days off approval. So I replied with I\u2019m sorry that happened but I\u2019m glad we can finally see each other. It was 9am here and she is usually tired from getting up so early and playing with her son so I figured she was asleep and went about my day. Come 9 pm my time I get a text from her best friend asking me if this was the guy dating cj I reply yeah who\u2019s this I\u2019m so and so  and I recall speaking to her back when she was in school and she tells me that cj died last night I immediately saw her brother online and confirmed it I dropped my phone I was with my family at the time my mother saw the message and I started crying my eyes out. \n\n\nSo yeah now I\u2019m trying to figure out what i should do I want to go see her son but the state of the area isn\u2019t a place where a foreigner should go I\u2019m trying to see if the family will be willing to travel so I can meet them in a safe area for me to meet her son. I\u2019ve gotten the I shouldn\u2019t go from many and a few saying I should but obviously is a safe place. I\u2019ve got 35 days till my ticket expires to either continue on my initial trip or change it with out losing money.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

They gave him some anti-anxiety meds and he calmed down, then they transferred him to a mental hospital.\n\nHe's been hospitalized before for depression, way back in the 80's, and has been on medication his whole life. He just weaned off a med, and then Mom dies \u2013\u00a0perfect timing. They have him on something new, but it takes time to take effect. \n\nThen again, it's not unusual to be suicidal and depressed after your spouse dies.\n\nThat's the worrying thing. He's never lived alone. He doesn't have the hobbies and friends and activities a person needs to stay occupied. He's not big on talk therapy and learning coping skills. I worry Dad expects a pill to fix this, and a pill is not going to fix this.\n\nMeanwhile, I live in another country, and haven't been home (that other country) in five weeks now. I have a flight booked home Friday, but I just can't do that while Dad is still hospitalized.\n\nI don't want the life I've built abroad to fall apart, but I just don't know how long it's going to take for Dad to be okay living by himself. At least my brother lives close by, but I shudder to think what might have happened if I hadn't been there to take him to the emergency room.\n\nThis is not looking good.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I never made it to his funeral and i think someone needs to read this and hear about him. Im not a writer by any means but ill do my best to portray a man who always had my back.\n\nTheo was raised by his mother in a small town, I don\u2019t know much about him from this time but from what I can tell from the stories i got from his family he was a quiet child, gifted with a brain that drew the attention of many of his teachers. Preferring isolation and books to the company of others. I remember talking with him, once and asking about the first time he was in a fight, most of the time he would say his first fight was at 15 over the fact some guy mocked the way he spoke. Though after a few drinks you could sometimes pull the truth out of him. I got the story of an eight year old kid trying desperately trying to choke out the 20 year old man who had beaten his sister unconscious in the living room of a small flat while his mother called the police. I think this is the single best way to sum up the man I grew to know. At any moment  willing to step inbetween someone he cared for and a beating or worse.\n\nTheo was always a contrast of a person he was loud boisterous never knew when to turn it down. He could be a massive arsehole and a braggart, he could hold a grudge like noone i have ever met. He was also unflinchingly loyal and compassionate to those he i believe loved. Would never talk badly about those he cared for even when being wronged by them. \n\nHe had his quiet moments too. More often then not when these moments occured i think sadness is what fueled them. I dont feel like he had much happiness in his life. while he was here i dont think many people took to time to realise this.\nOften on nights out find him the 6 foot 2 fridge of a human in the corner with some small drunk girl crying her eyes out alone as she spilled her guts about all that was wrong. Offering what advice he could. If you ever brought it up he would say he was trying to get his dick wet. Never saw him ever try.\n\nI think through one way or another he had this fundimental kindness that the world taught him was a weakness. The world never beat it out of him despite his efforts to convince people it had. Even after so much piled on top of him. Never wimpered never complained. He was a human with limitless measures of unconditional love. \n\nI ask people to take the time with people like this. Someone who on the surface may seem rough crude and dickish. And if you do have someone like this on your life ask what is wrong.

I was physically, mentally, and emotionally abused by him. He almost always put drugs before me and my sister. But beneath all those bad memories, there *were* some good ones.

He died of overdose. Even with all the mental issues I have that were caused by him, even with all the bad memories, I still find myself crying over his death. I don't miss who he was right before he died, I miss who he *used* to be. And it hurts that he didn't care enough to get better for his two children.\n\nOn top of that, two days later my uncle died. I wasn't all that close to him, but it certainly didn't help the situation. I'm a *very* overemotional person. \n\nAnd because of the way that I'm coping, I pushed one of my friends too faraway and I may never get her back. \n\nI have been an emotional wreck and the littlest things seem to trigger a sobbing fit, I just want to pull myself back together, but everything seems so impossible to do.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I\u2019ve turned my refrigerator into a \u201cwall of love\u201d where I pin up pictures or cards from people who love me the most. This way every time I come into my kitchen I can experience some happiness. I have love notes and photos from my boyfriend, housewarming cards and thank you cards from cousins and friends, and photos of my sibling and nephew and niece. I also have two copies of my aunts memorial card from the funeral, one facing forward with her dates of birth and death and a poem we wrote for her, and one showing the back which is a photo of her walking on the beach. \n\nI have them held together by a yellow magnet, which was her favorite color. Underneath that I have a housewarming card from her daughter. My aunt used to send me cards for every occasion on her and her children\u2019s behalf, so the fact that her daughter makes sure to send me cards for every occasion makes me feel like the tradition didn\u2019t die. \n\nLast night my boyfriend went to go swat a fly that was flying around my kitchen, and he swatted the fridge. All of my cards, photos, and magnets came flying off the fridge. I started yelling at my boyfriend telling him to be more careful with my belongings, especially those on the refrigerator. As I went to pick up all the magnets and cards scattered on the ground, I found that I literally couldn\u2019t pick them up. I started shaking. I realized in that moment that i couldn\u2019t remember how I had configured the photos and cards, and I couldn\u2019t find my yellow magnet for my aunt\u2019s funeral cards. \n\nThat\u2019s when I burst into tears on my kitchen floor. I was in a complete frenzy because I wanted to pick up the pieces but I couldn\u2019t. I was angry. I was sad. I just remember screaming \u201call I have left of her are these stupid fucking pictures.\u201d and \u201cshe\u2019s never coming back.\u201d I eventually found the yellow magnet under my kitchen table and was able to put everything back the way I had it. I cried on the couch for the next hour. \n\nIt\u2019s crazy how the little things send you back to the day you first heard the news. These bursts of grief can come days, months, and even years later after you think you\u2019ve mostly gotten over what has happened.

But then I realize that he\u2019s dead. But I look anyways. \n\nSometimes, like right now, I believe in my heart he will return. The fact that he can\u2019t is only a minor doubt to me.

We didn\u2019t have a massive family but he treated all 4 of his children with a full heart (me being the youngest) and protected us from the hard days that my abusive Mother created. He was the kind of father that even though he knew I would be ok driving home after visiting him with my kids, they were precious cargo to him so he would follow me home in his car and sit waiting till I had got into the house then he would drive home. He was a gentleman, generous, hard working and extremely talented. And if someone asked me to describe the perfect Father it would hands down always be him! \nThe week before my 27th birthday he asked me what I would like as a gift and because I liked to challenge him because I loved his ability to succeed I asked for a heart shaped mirror. And sure enough on my Birthday that\u2019s exactly what I got!!! The most beautiful heart shaped mirror I have ever seen... Little did I know that would be my last birthday with him in my life. He took ill shortly after, mostly because of the huge amount of stress my Mother caused him. He was back and forth to the drs with chest pains and his diabetes became out of control. He came to visit me one evening out of the blue and was very different. He looked drained and was sad. He cried and pretty much begged me to move in to my house because my Mum had become unbearable and he no longer could cope. I told him that I didn\u2019t have a room for him or a bed but we would try and sort something out so we can get him out of there. I felt useless because of all the years he had been there for me I couldn\u2019t even put him up in my house that night. He drove home and that was the last time I saw him alive. The next morning he had a heart attack and was rushed in to hospital. Two of my siblings came to my house very upset and told me that it was touch and go so they needed to get me to the hospital quickly, but it was too late, he had just died literally 5 mins before I got there and to top it off he was with my Mother at the time he passed. The person who caused him the most anguish in his life. She was emotionless and I never saw her cry once. \nThe worst possible thing I could have done was to see him in the funeral home, He looked empty and pained and I regret doing that because when he had just died he looked peaceful. I wish I could get the horrible funeral home image out of my head! Anyway all these years later not one of my family talk to each other anymore as we all one by one pushed each other away for one reason or another. Mostly because we didn\u2019t know how to live without him.

Both her and my mom were ill, and met in the context of healing from the illness. Eventually mom died. Many things happened in between, but I tried to stay in touch with my mom\u2019s friend because of the bond created by our shared history through my mom. I managed to stay in touch with her a couple of times a year on average since mom passed away, and also visited her a few times. The last time I spoke to her was in Christmas. I called her. She said that she was not doing very well. However she was a strong, reassuring person by nature, and I guess I underestimated how bad she was actually doing. I followed up a couple of months later, with an sms. This happened three days before her death. Over the phone she was reassuring, again. She said she was doing better. Today, six months after the funeral, I learned that she died three days after that last sms. Nobody in my family seems to be particularly shocked. The shared memories are jamming in my head and I don\u2019t know what to make of them. I don\u2019t understand why nobody informed me, or invited me to the funeral. I learned about her death from the newspaper. Perhaps she was more of a friend to me, than I was to her. But I still feel a strong spiritual tie to this person. I would like to talk about her to people, and I cannot, because everyone seems to have other priorities. I would like to greet her goodbye. I know I cannot do any of the above, and my questions will probably stay unanswered. I just wonder if you have any word for me, any comment, or any \u201csomething\u201d to say to help me unlock this feelings of exclusion, lack of closure, and irreparability. I wish I had called her, instead of just writing her the sms... among other things that I wish. But now it\u2019s too late.

The thing that broke me, was hearing them zip up his body. I guess at that point it became real to me. Seeing him at his viewing also ruined me. He looked nothing like himself. He was caked with so much makeup but I could still see the bruising. \n\nSince then, I cant sleep a full 8 hours. I think the most I've gotten in one night straight was 4 hours.

They were slated to come home a week ago yesterday, they texted my dad that they would be home soon.

I had no idea about anything until my sister called and said she wasn't feeling well for days and dad was trying to get her to the hospital. I live in another state. I made my sister call 911. Once in the hospital she was admitted to the ICU. I was able to get there and see her with my dad and sister. She was alert and obstinate as always. Refused to make a decision on whether she wanted surgery or not. She was worried about the cost and kept telling doctors she wanted to see the prices in writing. She died the next morning. \n\nWe had a complicated relationship and the grieving has been no different. My mom struggled with mental illness and was involuntarily committed about 12 years ago for awhile. She was a narcissist, and could be mean, but growing up she was my best friend. She was a good mom when I was a kid. I'm trying to remember who she was growing up, so I can feel something. I really haven't felt much. My grief has been all physical: diarrhea, nausea, caught a cold, headaches, tired. My emotional grieving is almost non-existent. I almost feel relieved she is gone. I no longer have to feel guilty that I don't want to talk to her or see her. I no longer have to be angry at her rude comments. I no longer have to dread mother's day because nothing was never enough. But then I feel guilty...  I hope eventually the guilt and relief will subside and I will feel sad that she's gone.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I need outsiders to provide me with a little insight that those biased around me cannot. \n\nHe was 25 when he died. We had been dating for about three months, everything was going so good we had a groove and we were good friends who talked about pretty much everything. He was super passionate about his craft beers (he worked as a bartender at a trendy bar) and so intelligent. He knew just about anything you asked him. He loved reddit, which is why I even made an account here in the first place. \n\nHe drove a motorcycle which he loved so much. On his way to work on a Thursday in May, a dumb truck killed him in an instant. On my way to work that same day, at about 2:50 pm I was driving and on the radio I heard of a motorcycle accident on a northbound highway. I did not pay it any mind, because my guy would never be involved. My friend called me at about 2:52 and asked if I had spoken to him. I hadn\u2019t, because he was working and I woke up with barely any time before I had to rush to work. I assured her that he could never be the one in the accident. \n\nI texted him\n\n\u201chey let me know if you're alive just heard about an accident on highway and it was a motorcycle and I'm shook up about it \ud83e\udd7a\u201d \n\nI expected a response. At around 5, I had already called him three times which went directly to voicemail. My friend and coworker suggested I call his workplace. I was too anxious to do it so she did it for me. They confirmed it. \n\nI broke down crying. I called my mom and she picked me up from work and I took a week off. Even now, a little over three months later it\u2019s hard to digest the fact that he passed away to quickly and was ripped from me like this. \n\nThe thing is, and why i feel so much guilt, that a few days prior to his passing I was considering breaking things off with him. We weren\u2019t on the same page about the future, I wanted more commitment and he wanted to just date because he had two jobs and no time for a healthy committed relationship. I never met any of his friends or family and he only ever met my friends that worked with me. \n\nI had to find his sister through a deep dive to ask her if it was really him involved in the accident. I found his best friend too. They had no idea who I was. Or they did, but placed no importance in me. His funeral happened about a week after but I made the decision to not even ask when it was. \n\nI felt and still feel, that I have no place to grieve when a family lost a son and a brother and a best friend. I only knew him for three months. I don\u2019t have the right to be in the same grieving space as his wonderful sister and mom. Even his asshole father. \n\nI stayed home for a week, my friends refusing to leave me alone to wallow. I don\u2019t think I correctly processed his death but it\u2019s only been three months. I\u2019ve made some questionable decisions since then but my guilt refuses to let me blame his death for my actions. \n\nI think I just need to allow myself more time to grieve.

She is 6 years older than me and this was my first relationship of over 5 months, and I was young when I got into it (started dating when I was 22 and broke up when I was 27).  We had sex for awhile after the breakup, but I was confused about a lot of feelings and at the time I didn\u2019t have the tools to communicate that I now possess in relationships. \n\nEarly on in the relationship once and later in about the second or third year I cheated on her (not sex but some oral and kissing). The guilt ate me up and though I loved her I was having a lot of guilt and felt like I didn\u2019t know myself as an adult, so I felt like I needed space. We broke up two years later. Eventually I was honest about the cheating. We even hooked up after that confession of guilt. Around the age of 29 I went to visit her with my (was our dog) and thought we were going to get back together, only to later be ignored because her roommate (and current boyfriend) made a grandiose gesture and left his serious relationship for her. I never stopped loving her, and by the time I got my shit together it was too late. I know she\u2019s probably gone forever, and she seems happy in her new life. I still feel the pain of guilt, though I\u2019ve forgiven myself for my mistakes, and  I regret not ever once really communicating what was going on in my young brain... I\u2019ve been in a couple relationships since, most recently a 2 year long relationship (I\u2019ll be 33 soon) and I\u2019ve learned how to communicate my needs, desires and feelings, and it almost makes me miss my ex even more because I know I could be a better partner now... tell me, does anyone have an effective technique for battling this type of grief? \n\nI miss her. It\u2019s been years now. I know I should be over it, but I truly feel I\u2019ve lost my soulmate. I blame myself for it ending, as I should... I know she\u2019s not coming back, but still dream about her when I make a point to stop thinking about her. It seems inescapable... it\u2019s really affecting me today and I could use some help.

On the day she died, she called me, frantic about her husband. He had died by suicide and she was alone. They married young, but he was the love of her life. Our call dropped, and I'm ashamed to say I was relieved in the moment because I had been having a long day and I did not know how to react. I texted her to make sure she was okay, and offered to have her come stay with me if she wanted company. She told me she had to talk to her husband's family the next day and that she was staying with a family friend. I think one of my biggest regrets in life will be taking her word for it. The next day, I found out about her death, and it feels like I have been spiraling ever since. Her funeral was genuinely the worst day of my life.\n\nMy mental health was already in a crummy place--I am a poor college student who grew up in an abusive household--but it feels like the worst manifestations of it have become more intense this year. I constantly fear that my loved ones secretly hate me and don't want me around, especially because the people in my life, for the most part, didn't know how to respond to my grief. After having a few awkward interactions I decided I didn't want to bother them with it, so I felt lonely. I am preoccupied with death and other morbid thoughts all the time, from worrying about my own untimely death or worrying that my dad (who is old and in poor health) will die.\n\nMy best friend's birthday is next week, and I feel like she has been on my mind more lately because of that. But in all, this year has been incredibly tough. I am coming up on my last year of undergrad, and I will be extremely busy with applying for grad school and preparing for the next stage of my life. I want to be able to give this the time that it deserves, but I don't want it to consume me to the point that I can't cope with daily life. I made it through last semester by the skin of my teeth and I don't want a repeat of that.\n\nI keep remembering the worst moments of our friendship and wishing I had been a better friend to her. She had endless faith in me and it feels like I didn't deserve it, especially with how I handled her last moments. When I went to her funeral, her god mom (who helped go through her things) said that she wrote about me often in her journals and drawing books. That meant a lot to me, but I can't help feeling like I didn't deserve that love and trust.\n\nI know that this is not something you \"get over,\" but I thought things would be a bit easier for me after how much time has passed. Does this ever get better? Has anyone had similar feelings? I am tired of feeling so desperately unhappy and unworthy of love. I am seeing a counselor regularly, but the days in between can feel absolutely suffocating.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

In my 22 years of life I haven\u2019t seen my father much because of substance abuse issues and not staying in one place for too long so it was hard to keep track of him. Every few years or so I\u2019d see him but before I knew it, he\u2019d be gone again. Not for a moment was I ever angry with him, even as a child. I understood he loved me and wanted to be more involved. I want to say I was eight or nine years old when I last saw him, and when I was thirteen I moved from Louisiana to Indiana so there was definitely no way I would have seen him again.\n\n I finished high school there and moved back home, and the following year reached out to him with the help of my maternal grandmother. I still have the letters he sent me to this day, because it\u2019s one of the only things I have to remember him by. We rebuilt a relationship that I\u2019ll always be grateful for, but I knew he still struggled with the problems that kept him from me. Sometimes he successfully stayed sober, and sometimes he\u2019d call or leave strange texts that were obviously done while under the influence (in those moments I wouldn\u2019t respond because I didn\u2019t know how to). \n\nSometimes he\u2019d ask me to get lunch with him, and I never did - not out of malice but because I guess I was so preoccupied with school and work. The last I spoke to him was Christmas of 2018. A few months ago, I was coming home from school and got a call from my grandma that she needed to talk to me and it was important.\n\nI learned he\u2019d passed away the prior week. My father was adopted and I wasn\u2019t close with that side of the family because he wasn\u2019t (although I spent many weekends and summers with them as a child). It took one week for his adoptive family to inform us of his death, yet it took not even five minutes for my mother to find his sister on Facebook to send a message of condolences (they also spoke on the phone of course so she could give her my number). \n\nHis sister called me the next day and we spoke for a while. I found out she donated most of his clothes to the homeless shelter he stayed at and they had a funeral service that I had no idea about. \n\nI am his only blood relative, and I was kept in the dark throughout this whole situation. I just want to know if it\u2019s justified for me to be angry with them for this. It\u2019s wonderful and noble for her to donate his clothes, but he and I connected over conversations of music and I know he had plenty of band shirts. I couldn\u2019t even have one of those? I couldn\u2019t have anything of his before it was all gone?\n\nThe anger I\u2019m feeling towards them is real, but isn\u2019t nearly as intense as the guilt for not speaking to him since Christmas. I can\u2019t even put it into words. He beat himself up so harshly for not always being around and believed so strongly I was angry with him, but I never had anything but love and understanding in my heart. The regret of not telling him this more often, of not being more involved and reassuring, it weighs so heavily on me that I\u2019m on a waitlist for a therapist. I don\u2019t know how long I have to wait. It\u2019s unbearable.\n\nI\u2019m sorry if this is incoherent or sloppy. I just feel like an awful person.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Crazy, obscene, LONG, can a post be too long?!?! Also, longtime lurker and first ever post. Throwaway to protect children. \n\nI've wanted to put this to \"paper\" for some time, 1. to maybe make someone else feel less alone or maybe make them feel better about their own grief and choices and 2. just get it all out there. Wish I could be more public and detailed but my children would never understand and be devastated beyond repair.\n\nSeveral years ago my spouse died in a horrific accident very near our home. We had 2 adolescent/teen children at the time. He was a big fish in a little pond and he was very well known in his industry in the US. His death was publicized like national news in our little town. There will never be words for my(our)loss, devastation, shock, heartache. We had been together since we were teens. Every major life experience we shared together and then some. He was my best friend. And to keep it real, he was also human and could be an absolute asshole, me as well. After more than 20 years together we knew each others best and worst sides and had fought and worked hard to keep a healthy, happy marriage. Most of the time we were great together but we had few years mixed in there of not being as happy as we wanted to be. We were on a great path at the end. \n\nHis death rocked my world and turned me numb to the core. I was suicidal for many months although I dont think anyone else saw it beyond just normal grief. As much as I was dying on the inside I would absolutely die before I brought more suffering to my children. We cried, talked, laughed, mourned, shut down, grieved and moved inch by inch for a long time. We talked about him, (and still do), like he was in the room. We celebrated his birthday and honored his memory and humor at every opportunity. He was the life of every party and to suddenly lose that energy changed every moment of our lives. None of us started therapy until atleast 6 months after. Too raw to dig too deep. But we kept it very real and open at home and with friends. There were no filters about any emotion. I also made an effort to find activities that would get us laughing and finding moments of joy in life. For me, grief and sorrow doesnt mean there can't still be smiles and laughter. \n\nTo the throwaway matter....All of the above being stated, I started having an unintentional relationship 6 weeks after his death. The relationship was with grade school/high school bestfriend that had been off the radar for 20 years. He called to offer condolences and slowly turned right back into my bestfriend/therapist/lover. The connection was as if time had never stopped for us. He listened to my endless tears and breakdowns and nightmares. He held my hand when I was lost and wanted to die. He cried for me when I cried when we made love. My family quickly discovered my relationship and was SO disapproving and judgemental! My behavior didn't fit their mold for grief. We all agreed the children could not know. The children to this day have NO idea and I hope never will. They could never understand such devastating loss and love in the same breadth, nor do most. This guy is no longer a romantic partner but still my best friend. Although most, including a therapist, would say I had no idea what I was doing and was only distracting myself from my grief, this guy was what got me through my grief. He helped me heal in a way no therapist ever could have. The endless, exhausting, emotional rollercoaster he supported at all hours was more than selfless.The heart has abundant room for love that doesnt have to labeled or categorized. As obscene, controversial and confusing as my hasty relationship was to everyone else and sometimes even myself, I have zero regrets. That new relationship did not change my grief, or sorrow or heartache. It only showed me that love is endless and true love doesnt die when a body does. For me, I felt that giving up would disrespect the life my husband lost. I am still privileged to be here living a healthy life and must keep living and enjoying life to honor him and the sacrifices he made taking care of us. 4 years later, it's still not always easy. There are still days I fall to a heap and stay sobbing for hours, but those days are few and far between now. I have found love again that my children are aware of, if not cautiously. Life keeps moving and I have chosen to honor that gift and keep moving as well, sometimes hour by hour full of sorrow, and sometimes just like the good old days with laughter and joy for days on end. Either way my husband is in the background for every moment.\n\nThere is absolutely hope within grief if you are willing to be patient and let go of fear and judgement and knowing new love and joy doesn't mean forgetting the past.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He remarried very soon after my grandmother divorced him (after years of mental and physical abuse that almost drove her to suicide more than once, as well as numerous affairs and spending most of his time on drugs and drinking heavily) and my mother told him that he wasn\u2019t allowed to skip in and out of my sister and I\u2019s lives\u2014 if he wanted to be granddaddy Glenn, he had to act like it. He chose to raise his second wife\u2019s grandkids instead, putting them into fancy private schools and buying them cars while my family went through quite a bit of time where debt piled up and we didn\u2019t know if we\u2019d have money for groceries. \n\nWhen I was about ten years old, he sobered up, and came to tell us he was a born-again Christian and had changed. He made a lot of promises then: he\u2019d take us to Disney world, and build a Bear, and buy us whatever we wanted from the mall. Did he keep a single one of his promises? Nope, he disappeared, time and time again. He\u2019d see us at a funeral or the family reunion, make a bunch of promises, and go back to raising his step-grandchildren while acting like my sister and I didn\u2019t exist. He\u2019s about as close to me as those cousins you see once every year or two at a big family gathering or funeral, where you only remember their name because you asked your mom first. Sure, I know who he is and that he\u2019s my grandfather because my mother made sure I knew, but I\u2019m not even sure he knows what I\u2019m studying in college. He\u2019s never sent a single birthday card, or called to see how I was doing, or even acknowledged my high school or associates degree graduation. His sister, my great aunt, has been to almost every chorus concert and theatre production without fail, and showed up at my graduation with $50 bucks and a page long letter in the card. I\u2019m not even sure if Glenn bothered to read the graduation announcement. \n\nHe hasn\u2019t been there for anything, so why do I hurt so bad now that he took his last breath a little under thirty hours ago? Why does my chest physically hurt when I think about how I don\u2019t have any memories to talk about at his funeral (because no one wants to remember how he couldn\u2019t keep a promise to get his ten year old granddaughter a $20 stuffed animal when you\u2019re supposed to be uplifting the dead in praise) or any pictures of us together to put on Facebook in memorial? Why do I feel angry at the thought of spending five hours at his visitation tonight\u2014missing almost all of my last D&amp;D session before I move three hours away for college\u2014 when he never spent more than five minutes talking to me when he was alive. This wasn\u2019t a sudden death, this happened after three months in hospice completely aware of his surroundings and KNOWING he wouldn\u2019t make it to February at all, if he even made it to thanksgiving. I\u2019m going to have to drink at least two Mike\u2019s Hard Lemonades before I go to the funeral home tonight, because the very thought of spending what could have been time with people I enjoy, instead being with consoling others over a man I have so much bitterness and anger towards, makes me angrier all over again. Why should I do what is expected of me as his granddaughter when he never did what was expected of him as my grandfather? He doesn\u2019t deserve my time, not after he wasted so much of my life. My mother keeps telling me he\u2019s been living in regret for over twenty-five years, but that\u2019s not good enough\u2014 if he truly regretted it, he should have tried to reach out to me. His regret means nothing to me if he didn\u2019t actually use it to make amends. \n\nHe\u2019s given me nothing to mourn, so why the hell am I crying over the fact we never got a relationship? Why can\u2019t I sleep at all because I can\u2019t get my mind to shut down and my emotions to settle? Why does my chest hurt so bad it feels like my heart is carving its way out of my chest?

I've dealt with the deaths of my other rabbit and a very friendly neighborhood cat (who basically spent all day on our couch), who each died a few years back. With the others I was better able to cope because I had my remaining rabbit for emotional support. Without her, without any animal support, it has been tougher. So there's some context, on to my question. My rabbit lived in a room right inside our front door, so every day when I got home I'd call out a greeting to her and say hello as I entered the house. She wouldn't come running over or anything, but she was always there. At this point, a few weeks after we had to put her down, I'm mostly fine, but I get a daily sad reminder every time I come home and my autopilot begins to call out a greeting to the now depressingly empty room. I know this is kind of oddly specific, but does anyone here have any ideas for how to change my habit, how to make it so that whenever I enter my house my first thought isn't me remembering losing her?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

In two weeks, I attended five memorials and a 4-day mountaineering trip, got 4 tattoos/piercings, traveled for over 20 hours, and nearly maxed out my credit card with extravagant self care (perhaps with a hint of self-destruction) and furniture for the apartment I moved into 3 weeks after it happened. \n\nDue to the nature of the accident, investigation, and resulting legal matters, I was exposed to photos and information about the crash that I wish I could unsee. I think my seeing it may ultimately do some good, but am now battling the hallucinations, nightmares, anxiety, and sleep deprivation that come with PTSD. It\u2019s been pretty crippling, and functioning on even a basic level has been (and continues to be) difficult some days, even with a regime of medication. \n\nSolely because I am bored out of my mind and the all-day introvert vibe is getting lonely, I decided to return to work next week. When I did that, I didn\u2019t imagine the panic attacks that would lead up to my return.

She was found in the shower, deceased, my her mom. Really, she's technically my cousin's daughter, but she's always been as close as a good cousin to me, especially since we're both the same age.\n\nIn my family, family is valued a lot. And the last time I saw my cousin who passed was when I shaved my head for a childhood cancer fundraiser and she came to support me. She had childhood cancer when she was younger and was declared cancer free after a couple of years, so she was my inspiration.\n\nJust to nights ago, she passed away really suddenly. She was healthy and seemed completely fine... So coming back from my nightly run to see my parents at the doorstep waiting to tell me that she had passed 30 minutes prior was a big shock. I had to tell a teacher that I would miss class Monday when I had a presentation (I caught him while the class was empty except for a kid making up a test so I decided I could tell him) and ended up crying the whole time I was explaining what had happened.\n\nOn the day she passed, I was shocked. I cried in the shower. But then on the second day, I felt like everything was a bad dream and I wasn't really in my body. The third day rolled around and I feel detached from my body, if that makes sense... The feeling of being in a dream is probably the best way to explain what it feels like. The thing is that I've felt like this before, and that was during the months I had terrible anxiety. It also seems like I feel detached from my body because I can't grasp the fact that she has really passed away or something...\n\nDo you think I'm in denial, or is anxiety a part of grief? What's happening to me? I'm just really confused... Honestly, you guys don't need to just answer to my questions. Losing family this close to me is something really new to me, so I have no idea what's going on.\n\n((I'm typing this whole really sleepy, so I'm sorry if my writing is bad or my grammar/spelling is wack...))", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

On Wednesday the 14th of August he was attacked by a feral and ran off across the road to a place we cannot access and search. He's most likely so close that he can come out of whatever hidey hole he's found and come home. But, he's a massive scaredy cat that only really knows how to be an indoor cat. Its Saturday morning and I've prepared for the reality of him never coming home. Wherever he is, I fear he is stuck and unable to return.\n\nLast year he's brother was stolen from our then home and never returned. It has been a painful 18 months without him and the loss of my only cat this week has pushed me over the edge. I've had an extremely difficult year, I had knee surgery, I'm currently in the 13th month of looking for permanent employment and have realised my microbiology degree is effectively uselss. A ton of other small things have happened to frustrate and pain me, but through all this I had my cat.\n\nA 7kg bundle of pure love and affection. Through the 6 years I've had him he has provided nothing but love and affection during even my darkest hours. He's been a better companion than any human has ever been. He's a large grey ball of love, companionship and understanding . Everyday when I'd get home, I'd hear that distinct meowing as I walk up the steps from the underground parking, \"Human! You're home! I've missed you!\". That's what those distinct meows of excitement meant. As soon as I'd locked up and put my things done, it meant snuggle time and carrying the tiny little emperor (his newest nickname) around.\n\nWhen I didn't hear that on Wednesday I knew something was wrong. Immediately my gut told me I had to find him and he was gone. I was right as confirmed by the groundskeeper and a security guard next door. He had run off in a panic after being attacked by a feral. I knew where he was but had no access to the area as the groundskeeper there was uncooperative and spiteful. She refused to let us in to even search or let us call a resident or the owner for permission to search. Google has no answers for me as to who owns the building or the individual apartments. Somewhere he's frightened, hungry and alone. I've been sick with worry and have done everything in my power to get him back and to search for him. But I don't think he'll be coming home. It's been so long that I'm sure he can't find his way back anymore.\n\nHe's never been just a cat, he's always been a part of my family, a small fuzzy pawed part but a part non the less. In his small green eyes I've seen more love and affection for me than anyone else has ever shown and it hurts more than words can describe knowing I only had 6 years with him. There hasn't been a single moment in those 6 years I regretted adopting him. Him and his brother were the two most loving animals I've ever owned. The loss of both of them in a year and half has crushed me completely. I can't eat or sleep properly and crying has just been part of what I do for the last few days. \n\nI've never felt more alone in the world than now. He may have been \"just a cat\" but he's my cat. He's my small ray of sunshine in the dark world and now he's gone. I miss him more and more as every hour passes. He was a source of comfort during the time I had him and a constant unwavering source at that. \n\nI'll always love you my fuzzybutt, you're still my favourite person even if you're just a cat.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

In May 2014 she went into anaphylactic shock while driving and was in a horrible car accident.\n\nShe actually died a few times in the hospital. She had stage 3 brain trauma and wasn\u2019t supposed to survive, much less be able to walk and talk and leave the hospital in like 2 months, but that\u2019s just what she did. Even the doctors said it was a miracle. She was a miracle.\n\nAnyone with experience with TBI can attest that it\u2019s hard. The struggle doesn\u2019t end after they leave to hospital. We butted heads over stupid things a lot those first few years. But we always made up eventually. You know, sister stuff. You love them, you hate them, you love them again lol\n\nShe had several conditions that caused her severe daily pain. She rarely complained. She never gave up. I can\u2019t emphasize how strong she was. I could never be half as strong as her. \n\nLast year she actually moved out on her own. Then a few months ago she stopped answering my moms texts, so she asked her roommate to check in on her. She was unresponsive on the floor. He did CPR and gave first aid until paramedics arrived. She survived thanks to him. She died and came back yet again. She spent like a week in the hospital (causing trouble and being stubborn for the drs, typical of her lol) and after this she moved in with her dad to be monitored better. The drs figure she went into anaphylaxis again and couldn\u2019t get to her epipen in time.\n\nShe was so happy to be with her dad (we have different dads) They\u2019ve had issues in the past, Custody battle and stuff, but they were getting along very well and she was so happy there. We were all closer together so I saw her a lot again. Id never admit it, but I missed her a lot when she moved out. The whole family was happy. It seemed like things might be looking up. \n\nOn Thursday she stopped answering my moms texts. She asked her dad to check on her so he finished what he was doing and headed to her room. She was already gone. He called my mom but she could barely understand him he was beside himself. I had my shoes on by the time she got off the phone. I\u2019ll never forget us sitting in the car, her turning to me and going \u201care you sure you want to come?\u201d I just said \u201cyes\u201d and she started the car. \n\nWhen we got there I ran ahead, passing the ambulance outside I asked \u201cis she in there?\u201d And the paramedic just said no. I just ran inside. There was a cop blocking her door. I turned to her dad who was sobbing in the kitchen and said \u201cdid they give up?\u201d And he just shook his head. I must\u2019ve sounded crazy to the policewoman because I turned to her and said \u201clisten to me, she dies all the time, you just have to keep trying. She will come back. Just keep trying. She does this all the time.\u201d \n\nShe just told me they\u2019d tried all they could. That she was gone. I asked to see her, thinking in my head somehow I could do CPR and bring her back myself since they\u2019d given up. They said I couldn\u2019t see her until the medical examiner arrived and did his thing. So I waited for hours while he finished his thing. I was there with my parents, her dad, our little sister, and my grandma. I waited and waited. When he was done I asked to see her. They said I couldn\u2019t. I said just her hand. Let me hold her hand. Just let me touch her hand. They wouldn\u2019t. That\u2019s the point I just lost it screaming and crying and being hysterical. I just wanted to hold my big sissy\u2019s hand. Just for a second. They wouldn\u2019t let me. \n\nThe ME was obviously suspicious about such a young woman dying unexpectedly and was treating it almost as a crime scene. All they told us about what they think happened was that it appeared she was eating cherries and it\u2019s possible she choked. Now if she survived all the shit she has, just to die by choking on a fucking cherry, I might just lose it. I won\u2019t be able to handle that. Anything but the fucking cherry I can accept. Not. The. Fucking. Cherry.\n\nSo she was supposed to have an autopsy yesterday, we might be getting some answers today but the full report is going to take a long time. Today we\u2019re meeting with some funeral homes. I know she\u2019d want to be cremated. She always talks about that jewelry with ashes in them, and she thought they were great. The thing is if I don\u2019t see her I will never accept that she\u2019s dead. I\u2019ve been laying awake all night convincing myself that there are tons of stories of people coming back to life in freezers and it being a miracle. She\u2019s a miracle, why wouldn\u2019t she come back in a damn freezer? That sounds exactly like something she\u2019d do. I know it\u2019s illogical. I need to see her. Just her hand even. I just need to touch her to convince myself it\u2019s real. I don\u2019t want her embalmed and to have a whole viewing ceremony, I just want to touch her hand for a second. I don\u2019t care how fucked up she looks. That stuff doesnt get me. I don\u2019t even have to see the rest of her. Just her hand. Something. Her hair. I don\u2019t care. I just need to see her. If they don\u2019t let me I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get over it. \n\nEither way we\u2019re still telling loved ones. What the fuck is wrong with people who hear and immediately post shit to Facebook. Not everyone knows yet, just keep your fucking mouth shut for 2 god damn days until we finish the obituary at least. We haven\u2019t posted shit about it, it\u2019s not your place to out us. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a message of support, fucking private message it to us then. They think the attention they get on Facebook is more important than our privacy and chance to tell certain people before it\u2019s blasted all over the god damn internet.

We do some tests in the hospital and leave, about halfway home we get a call from the hospital to come back immediately. What happened then was finding out he had a brain tumor and was then flown to another hospital with stepmom riding, this was it I thought and hd th worst drive home.  \n  \nMy brother got me a plane ticket to go see dad and we stayed in the hospital and went though his recovery and treatments, it was then he was told by doctors he'd need to start taking insulin injections and limit his diet.  \n  \nWe get home and dad and stepmom couldn't do the injections so I took over it, and his medication, and watching his diet and limiting carbs, even if it meant fast food was what he wanted that was okay with limits. Shortly after we learn that the brain tumor was limiting his vision so he couldn't drive. Stepmom doesnt know how to drive so i took on this responsibility too.  \n  \nThings are going ok, I'm doing the best I can for him. In January 2019 we get another scare. He just passes out hard on the toilet and 911 is called, it was a result of low blood pressure  but still a scary week in the hospital leading to his recovery.  \n  \nIn July 2019, he started to have a lot of difficulty walking, and has been stubborn about it. In august of 2019 we take him to the hospital simply because we cannot get him up off his chair, he cant walk and is in too much pain. We learn his cancer spread to his lungs.  he sharply deteriorates over a very stressful week leading to his passing in hospice.  \n  \nNow I'm just, feeling so alone.

And when he went back to school, none of his peers would bring it up because they were scared to upset him.\n\nThis resulted in him going almost a decade with acting like she never existed and just pushing all the negative emotions away.

He was essentially like a little brother I never had. Being only half a year younger than me and sharing most interests, we spent time together almost always, feeling like he really was someone who finally cared about me and understood me, and he felt like someone I had to look out for, to protect. We made so many plans together, for the future, some of which were rather ridiculous looking back (since back then we were 14), but some actually even got into their early execution phases, like actually forming application letters for universities. We shared many hobbies at the time, being sneakerheads, loving the same movies and songs, snowboarding and parkour/freerunning. Every weekend we would meet up and do some jumps, usually on roofs. One day, we went on top of trains. That I would concider one of the best days I ever lived.\n\nOne day I moved away, from Switzterland to Italy. Funny enough, I found it harder to part from him than from my current girlfriend. About 2 months after I moved, I was sitting in my room when my friend from Switzerland called me, informing me that Jelle had been transported to the hospital in critical conditions. At first I did not believe, but as she explained I understood it was not a joke. He had climbed the trains again, to re-live some memories. Except this time, he got too close and got hit by a very high voltage from the cables above the rail-way. \n\nDuring his coma, I was supporting his two younger sisters, Eva and Roos. Roos, being the older one, about 13 at the time kept me in course about everything. I was in school at the time, writing my English exam when she texted me to call her ASAP. I excused myself to the bathroom, and called her. She said that they have decided to disconnect Jelle\u00b4s life support, as he was in huge pain. He was alone in a hospital room for days, in pain because 75 percent of his skin had burnt. Accepting the fact that he was living his last hours, I asked Roos to ask Jelle whether or not he remembered me (he had amnesia which affected his last 2 months) and that \"I felt blessed and honored to have a friend like Jelle.\" and went back to class. \n\nAt around 6am the next day Roos wrote to me, that Jelle had passed away at 5:30am. What haunted me the most, was that when Roos told Jelle what I asked her to, he actually started displaying sadness. Before this he did not. He was happy to die. Until that moment. \n\n11 days later his funeral took place at which I was lucky enough to hold a speech. \n\nNow here comes why I came here, looking for help. I have not felt any sort of pain, grief or whatsoever up until two months ago. Of course, I was sad at first. Lost a friend, never get to see him again. But it passed me as fast as it came. I thought about it a lot, considered myself a really bad human being. But here we are, almost two years later, and I feel ready to give anything to see Jelle again. I started dreaming about him, missing him, finding more and more moments that remind me of him in which I think \"Damn, I wish he could be here. He would love that\". Even thoughts about the fact that I introduced him to parkour, which essentially killed him, meaning I partially killed him keep crossing me. I feel overwhelmed by this, and even talking to my parents, or even my girlfriend does not help. She simply has too many aspects that remind him of me. I feel like nobody understands me really. So I came here, looking for help. How do I deal with this? With my last two highschool years coming up, I really am feeling anxious, and this situation is not helping. Any sort of support is very appretiated.\n\nI apologize for the huge text and wish eveyone a blessed day.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I ask to borrow my friend's lipstick. \"Where are you going now?\" he asks. I'm going to hear a live band at a local bar just a few minutes from my house. I don't have a date, I just want to hear some live music. He just shakes his head at me.\n\nHe didn't spend 30 of his formative years with his soulmate. He didn't watch that person die in his arms suddenly and unexpectedly. He just knows his older sister is going out for the evening, and he doesn't like it.\n\nI'm at the bar, the music is rocking. The bar is hot, so I step outside to get some air. A good looking woman I've never met before sits beside me. She talks to me like she's known me all my life. She takes my hand and leads me back onto the dance floor. At one point she kisses me. Another woman joins us. The three of us are all feeling the beat of the bass, dancing to every song, letting go of all our cares and worries for a few hours. We've all experienced loss and sorrow, but for tonight we will put it behind us for a while. Sometimes we slow dance, sometimes we rock out. Everyone is having a great time. It's exhilarating. I haven't gone out dancing like this in decades. \n\nFinally it's time for me to go home. I get in my car, and can't fight back the tears. This would be the point in the evening I would be coming home to him - to tell him about the hot brunette hitting on me, to tell him how the band rocked, and to take him to our bed and finish out the evening as only we did best. Only he's not there. And this giant empty hole in my chest feels like my soul has been ripped out through my rib cage. And I wipe my eyes so I can see to drive.\n\nSo yeah, sometimes we rock out and dance the night away, because it's the only way to temporarily shoo away the demons that follow over our shoulder constantly reminding us that our world was shattered, that we will never love that way again. Sometimes sweating and dancing and crying to a rock band is like a ritual of healing, because we are still living and breathing creatures, grasping to celebrate the life our loved ones helped us create.

I had had a long week, I was broke and didn\u2019t want to be bothered but, I am a woman of my word. \n\n\nI\u2019ll never say I am one to believe in love at first sight, but there was something because when my gaze met his for the first time, there was a spark. He was different. We were different together. It was honestly like a movie. For instance, after our hours long first date, it was Monday morning and time for me to go home. \n\nWe had scheduled my Uber for 12:00 pm. It was now 11:55 am and my driver was on his way( Now that I\u2019m thinking about it I called off that day to be able to have more time with him, boy am I happy I did now) he was sitting on the edge of his bed and pulled me down to straddle him when Al Greens \u201clet\u2019s stay together\u201d starts playing on his speaker. It was just so funny because honestly, could you even THINK of anything cheesier happening? Truthfully, neither one of us wanted me to go. I kinda pulled back from the hug and looked at him, those bright blue eyes shimmering and he\u2019s grinning, that big smile stretching ear to ear and says\u201d what I didn\u2019t plan this\u201d. \n\n\nAnd so, that is how things went for us. Our time together was just, on fire. He was going to take me fishing and shooting. We were going to go four wheeling and ride dirt bikes. He was supposed to teach me how to play guitar, he was my skydiving buddy. Everything we said we were going to do together, I will do. I\u2019ll do them but I know I\u2019ll have him with me. I feel so strange because I had him for such a short time, but there\u2019s this lasting impact he\u2019s made on me. We never ended up officially initiating a romantic relationship. As time went on as life goes, we get busy. We got little more distant than what I liked but he was always there and assessable if I needed him. I got so comfortable and used to that idea. I was in the process of looking for a car and an apartment. He had bought a house about an hour away and had to be to work at 3am so that made it hard. \n\nThe thing about it is, we still had time together. We would be on the phone for hours on end. A lot of times he stayed up way too late with me. We were like teenagers, honestly. It was just such an authentic \u201cI like you\u201d. And when we could get together in person I can\u2019t even describe the feeling he made me feel. He was so trusting, he\u2019d give me his phone, which was always funny because it was an android and I had the hardest time learning how to use it so I could never figure it out. I was always the DJ and he would tell me \u201cJust download the music you play\u201d so I could have my choices cycled through when we were together and so he could learn them. So simple, but that was the beauty of him. \n\nThere was so much going on in those eyes and the way that man looked at me. Every time he looked at me, i just felt it. He had such an admiration for me and I don\u2019t understand it because in my eyes he was the one. It\u2019s just, I\u2019ve always heard of people having people like this. I just never thought I would be one.   \n\nHe taught me so much in the little time I had him. We made so many plans together. The last time we spoke, I told him I missed him and he told me he missed me too and that he had just been busy with work and renovating his house, but that we needed to get together again. He normally would reach out to me at least, at the very least once a week and that is from the last time one of us messaged each other. I was a little salty and worried as it had been just over a week and that never happened . Seeing as how things were so busy for both of us and I didn\u2019t have a car. \n\nI am A reason that there was distance. Not because I didn\u2019t want him but because I honestly have self esteem issues and doubted him wanting me, I will work on that. (I\u2019ve even found myself doubting my validity to be grieving while writing this)I blamed it on (and still want to) blame it on the fact that I didn\u2019t have a car. It\u2019s stupid, I didn\u2019t want him to try and go above and beyond for me, I told myself it wasn\u2019t fair, that in order to be in a functional relationship and to be equal and fair to him, I needed a car first. \n\nAnyway, on this past Friday, I went to message him but decided to try Facebook first, just to check and then found out he had died on Tuesday and it was Friday, no reason why posted and no funeral details. Up until that point I had only met his mom and that wasn\u2019t planned and probably shouldn\u2019t have happened so soon. I reached out to his brother solely based on the fact that I had to. He got back with me quite promptly and told me thank you and that he had mentioned me often and was definitely a fan of mine as well. I was also invited to the memorial service they are having for him.  I was shocked but honestly it warmed my heart and I will be going. \n\nThere\u2019s so much more. So much that I can\u2019t say because it wasn\u2019t said. But also because some things do go without saying. This is hard. He was more than I ever expected. I am so hurt and confused. We had so much shit to do together. It just feels like I lost him at the beginning of our journey and I just don\u2019t understand why.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My dad took my mother to the hospital where she was admitted. They did an angiogram and found 4 blockages in her heart.\n\nThey then moved my mother to a hospital down in Ogden, Utah, between the Salt Lake City and Cache Valley area (I live in SLC, parents in Cache Valley). She was to undergo cardiac bypass surgery. Mom was in okay shape, in good spirtis, but her blood pressure was too high, and her body had already undergone so much in the last year that this was concerning to me\nI thought she might die. But I stop, and think: She's only 74. Everything will turn out fine.\n\nWe take my sister's kids for the weekend and go back to Salt Lake so my sister and dad who live at my parent's house can get some rest.\n\nOn August 5th, the hospital perform surgery on my mother. Things went as the surgeon expected, except they found 5 blockages and doubt one of them would take. They being my mother to the ICU and she's coherent at some point, saying people's names, and she isn't all there, but who is after open heart surgery? Eventually things start to heal and she is able to hold my dad's hand. I was working that day and checked in on the surgery throughout the workday.\n\nOn August 6th, I go up to visit after work. Mom is really tired from all of the drugs and stuff. We get some words out of her, but not too much. Me and my dad get food in the cafeteria and I go back to Salt Lake for work the next day, and I don't see my mother the following day, but I call to check up on Dad.\n\nOn August 8th, my dad and nephew have gone back up to Cache Valley to sleep the night. Mom has a longer recovery ahead than we thought. None of the family is to be with her on Thursday night as we've been up and down like crazy the past few days, so I decide to go to the hospital to keep mom company. I walk into the ICU room and she is on a breathing tube.\n\nI remember the sunset, colors of blue and orange, a rainy night with an interesting sundown. I stayed with my mother at the hospital until 9:40PM, seeing if there were any little things I could do to make her feel more comfortable. I got a warm blanket, held her hand, talked to her, said goodbye, and left to go back to Salt Lake for work the following day.\n\nAt 10:03PM, my sister who is a cardiac ICU nurse calls me to see how mom is doing. At 10:15PM, my other sister calls me and tells me to turn the car around and head back to Ogden. I call the hospital for details, and they say her heart stopped pumping, and they had to do CPR for 2 minutes to get her back.\n\nThe hospital called all of the family to the ICU. We were all there by 11:40PM, and they were having doubts about being able to sustain her as she may have cardiovascular shock or sepsis, and her blood pressure is too low, her organs are shutting down, and the only option left is CRRT dialysis. We try this for about 7 hours, and not even a tiny improvement is happening, she is continuing to decline.\n\nThe family reconvines once more slightly past 8AM on Friday morning, and we discuss my mother's end of life documents. It says in the documents not to keep her on life support if there is a chance she will not recover or will be permanently handicapped, and the doctors determined we were well past that point. She was on so much medication keeping her alive that there was nothing left to be done, and the only sustainable way was to keep her on the maxed out doses of what she was already on, which was starting to cause very negative side-effects as well.\n\nShortly after 1PM, my sister who works in another hospital in the Cardiac ICU ward began to advise the nurses on which dosages of which medication to lower that would stop my mother's heart from beating, as the nurses injected fentanyl to help mom with amy pain. My sister was living her worst nightmare, she was essentially advising the nurses on how our mother should die. A large amount of family gathered around the room as we watched mom go for 120bpm to flatline within 20 minutes. By 1:42pm, she was pronounced dead.\n\nEveryone said their goodbyes once more as my mother laid dead on the hospital bed, and me and my partner were the last ones to leave. I stood there, my dead mother in front of me, my face wet with tears, with no more medical equipment connected, my mother's mouth agape, and dead. I knew what I was seeing, but I didn't want to believe it.\n\nOn August 15th, we laid my mom to rest, putting on a spectacular funeral service for her which our family and our friends were very moved by. The funeral was quite packed. I got up and spoke, failing to hold my words together as I read one of the last messages I sent to her and got back from her. They were messages of gratefulness, love, and joy. A mother and son's love. \n\nIt is now August 19th, I've returned to work, and I'm incredibly depressed. I got a tiny raise and received more good news at work today, and I almost always call Mom when I get news like this, because she just adores hearing it and gushing over how amazing her kids are. Now mom is no longer there.\n\nIt's hard to describe what this is like. I've never had someone so close to me die before. I'm very saddened that she won't see me get married, watch more of her grandchildren grow to be adults, or be with my father.\n\nI miss my mom.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Everyday I am grieving a loss that is to come. I torture myself with sad thoughts on a daily basis. Imagining when things take a turn for the worse, when she decides to surrender to the cancer (right now she's still trying to fight and undergoing treatment), playing in my head how her final days will be, if it will be painful or peaceful for her, how on earth will I get through her funeral, etc.  All of those things. That\u2019s why anticipatory grief is so hard. When my dad passed away unexpectedly, it was extremely hard, but you\u2019re able to start the grieving process right away. With this, it\u2019s a daily fear and worry and anticipation. It\u2019s both a blessing and a curse. A blessing to be able to tie up loose ends and let nothing go unsaid (which is such a gift. I didn\u2019t get that with my dad), but it\u2019s SO hard to get through.\n\nIt is so hard to think of having our final goodbye or our final conversation, knowing that the time is nearing. I think that is the hardest scenario for me to picture - when she's in hospice and still coherent, knowing she is about to die and us saying everything we want to say to each other. Telling her that she is the best mom I could have ever asked for and that I will go on honoring her, remembering her, loving her and making her proud. We have had those conversations already, but the finality of knowing \"this is really the end\" and having to have that conversation one last time is more than I can even bear to think about.\n\nI'm also struggling with all of the milestones in my life that she is going to miss out on. I am the only one out of my siblings who has yet to be married or have children. She got to be there for all of those milestones for my siblings and they were some of the proudest moments of her life. She loves her Grandchildren more than anything. Being a Grandmother is her pride and joy. The fact that my future children won't get to know and love her, and vice versa, puts my heart in wrenches. I feel like life will never feel happy or normal again.\n\nHas anyone dealt with this kind of grief, and does it get easier? Is there a sense of peace once they pass? Will it ever get better?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My great uncle a couple days before my great aunt\u2019s birthday. And now my grandpa. Two weeks after my birthday, 9 days after his birthday, and the day of my cousin\u2019s 8th birthday.\n\nMy grandpa had been in the hospital for almost a month. He ignored a really really bad cough, loss of appetite, and overall unwell feeling for what we speculate to have been many months. \n\nHe initially went to the doctor for it, and was told it was a UTI. He got a couple shots and was sent home. Two days later he went back to the hospital with chest pains and was then diagnosed with moderate COPD (heavy smoker for years), severe pneumonia, low kidney function, and extremely low sodium. I don\u2019t know how these people missed that the first time\u2014they did bloodwork both times, but somehow it\u2019s just a UTI and then two days later his body is basically shutting down?\n\nTwo nights later he had a heart attack and was rushed to a bigger hospital about an hour away, but he survived. He was doing good. Another couple of days and he has a second, bigger heart attack. This time they put him in an induced coma and place a breathing tube. He had that in place for ten days? Maybe more. His kidneys were failing, his liver was barely functioning (history of extreme alcoholism but sober for 10+ years), and his blood was very thick. \n\nHis pneumonia just kept getting worse. They found a small spot where he was bleeding into his lungs. Even after they stopped the sedatives and paralytics he didn\u2019t wake up for days, because his body couldn\u2019t metabolize and get rid of them from his system. \n\nIt looked so grim. \n\nBut then, he started getting better! They started dialysis and he began to wake up. After a day or two he was alert, commanding, communicating through writing, sitting up, moving around, etc. They took his breathing tube out the day after they had made plans to perform a tracheotomy. \n\nHe did so so well. He was moving between the hospital bed and a chair. Talking. He was actually talking! It looked like he was really going to beat this and go home. His pneumonia was stable and not getting worse, his kidneys were getting better, his liver was doing better. \n\nHe kept talking all day about how he was ready to go home. He wanted to be home... I\u2019m realizing now maybe he somehow knew it was time for him to go \u201chome.\u201d To be with God. He wanted ice cream. He kept asking for it, but he couldn\u2019t have it. \u201cMaybe tomorrow you can have some ice cream, Grandpa.\u201d \n\nBut then last night, his heart just stopped. Flat lined. Out of nowhere. They resuscitated him, and my mother, grandmother, and I rushed to make it back up there in time to say goodbye and be with him.\n\nHe was gone for 6 minutes the first time. Then it happened again... he was dead before we made it there. When we arrived we walked into his room to see him grey, lifeless, and cold. They didn\u2019t call to tell us. They just let us show up and find out for ourselves. None of his other kids from his previous marriage before my grandmother bothered to call us either, despite them being there when he died.\n\nI think I was in shock. I couldn\u2019t cry. I feel numb. He was getting better. He was doing so good, and then just hours later he\u2019s dead. I probably looked stone cold that hour we spent just standing around his cold, dead body. I just stared into space and tried to feel... anything. Anything at all. \n\nI finally broke down this morning, seeing all the RIP posts all over Facebook. A man I\u2019ve never met sent me a message, giving condolences and telling me how my grandpa had saved his life when he was struggling with addiction. \n\nHe was such a good man. He struggled for years before finding his God and beating his alcoholism. He spent more years working at the same rehab he\u2019d finally recovered in, aiding so many in finding their peace and recovery as well. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine never seeing him again. Never hearing his voice again. Never getting one of his hugs again. \n\nI love you grandpa. I\u2019ll miss you forever. Rest In Peace.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

So in the summer of 2017, my father passed away due to stage IV cancer. I was the one holding his hand when he died, and my girlfriend of a year and a half was helping my mom as she went into shock. Fast forward to this year, me (21 M) and my girlfriend (21 F) were still together since then until a couple months ago where she broke it off. We were together for 3.5 years. She told me the reason for it was in the two years since my dad died I was never there for her emotionally, neglected her and that when she wanted to get physical I never wanted to. I still love and cherish this woman more than anything on this planet, but this break up hurt. When I used to have panic attacks about my dad, she would calm me down, and tell me that she would wait as long as it took for me to get better. Thats what confuses me as I felt as in the later portion of these past two years, I started to get into the acceptance phase of grief with my father, and really feeling as if I could change for the better and be the person he wanted me to be. But with this break up I\u2019ve had time to reflect and realize that I did do those things to her, put it was never purposefully or with any intent on hurting her feelings. I realized that I was depressed and anxious and suicidal but that I never expressed it. And all of those flaws and changes in character was a result in me grieving over my father. I just truly believe that this person I was for the past two years is not me, and I\u2019m afraid that with this break up I may revert back to my old ways, which is what I don\u2019t want because I want to change for me and for her. Sorry if this is too long, I just recently realized that I had subconsciously repressed thoughts of suicide and needed to express my feelings on my situation somehow.

My godmother lost her husband three years prior.\n\nHe  fell and broke his leg. He then was operated and in rehabilitation  afterwards on his way being better.  Being there he complained about  pain in his broken leg and was shushed by the personal of the clinic.  Later they found that the screw they planted in to fix the broken bones  had been come lose and was scratching on his bone. Then they moved him  to the hospital, but he already started to deteriorate, sliped in a coma  shortly after his arival and woke up only once to gestiure a kiss to  her. Because the injury was caused by a fall police was involved. When  he was cleared he was send to the morque imidiatly and my godmother  could not say goodby to the love of her life of almoust 40 years. ( We  are in germany, open cofins ar not commen and he was cremated) He was  not a healthy man, got a new kidney 10 years back and had heart problems  due to his medication so his sudden death was just kind of sudden. Also  he died just two weeks before his birthday ( allready planned and  guests had been invited) and exactly one month befor their anniversary,  making a whole month just hell for my godmother.\n\nHer  niece and I are trying to help her as best as we can. The first  year was very though and we feared we might lose her to alcohol or a  broken heart. After this she stared to get better and better. She is  still griefing for her husband, but we all know that this is normal and  takes time. In fall last year she seemed optimistic for the first time.  Taking on projects and planning on buying a dog. So on a good way, one  would think. The dog (f, labrador) is now 8 month old and living with  her since march. And she seems to be completly overwelmed with this  young energetic animal. She loves her very much and is trying to train  her but she is just not able to take controll over the dog. Her comands  are ignored 80 to 90% of the time, which can be dangerous when the dog  escapes the large garden and runs onto the street (luckyly no heavy  traffic). She went to training with the dog and got frustrated when she  was criticized by the trainer/breeder. I thought this might be, because  she doesn't work well with the breeder/trainer, because both are very  headstrong woman who had a lot to fight in their life and sometimes this  doesn't mix well. But she is really bad in taking criticism and feels  attacted whenever one is telling her when she makes a mistake. Her  niece, who is like a daughter to her, was so feed up, that she was  thinking about not showing up on this years obit. She showed up, but I  feel it is a sign how far things have gone between the two of them. I  thought that this is the part where you see how her husband is missing.  He always was calm and collected and like a rock. Even if something  happend he wasn't shocked or didn't show. He handled everything calmly  and carefully, balancing her out in a way.\n\nBut  a few days ago I was there and overheard something she told some  friends who visited her. The dog had been very exited, because she loves  people and was jumping and running around trying to get pets. My  godmother was stressed. This sunday is her husbands birthday, so we are  kind of in the middle of this hellish month. I took the dog out to play  with her a little bit and to distract her and when I came in my  godmother was crying. She was telling her guests ( very very good  friends, who allready know this story) how it came that she has no  children of her own and they tried to comfort her, telling her that she  had me and her niece and than I added: \"And you have \\[Dog\\].\" she than  scoffed and said. \"And what a dog \"I\" have. I just brought her, because  \\[husband\\] said, when I retire we do all the things we wanted to do  again, travel and making a cruise and getting a dog. He always wanted  his own labby.\" I can't get this out of my head. Let me make it clear  again. She loves that dog to pieces. But everything looks quiete  different to me after hearing this.\n\nShe  is still griefing for her husband and I thing her problems with the dog  are mirroring this. Seeing the friction it causes with her niece, which  she practicly raised, I think she is at a point where she needs  professional help to move on. The problem is, that she told me two years  ago, that she can't go to a support group, because she can't open up in  front of strangers. And a group of strangers is simply overkill for  her. So I was thinking she should be looking for a therapist, but I have  no idea how to bring this up to her without mortaly offending her. Like  I said it is this very hard time right now but I fear, when this time  passes she might not see the need in seeking help. But making this more  problematic, a few month after her husbands death, a lot of people  pushed her to be over with the grieving and moving on in life. She was  rightfully pissed, but others might have done more harm. These people  added, that if she wasn't over it after new year (her husband died in  august) she should seek out a support group, because this was not  normal. So me telling her to find a therapist to help her with the grief  is a highly emotionally charged. But I fear, moving on like this will  make her push more people away from her.\n\nDoes anyone has any advice how to handle this situation?\n\ntl;dr: Godmother is grieffing her dead husband and this is starting to affect her relationships.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I felt like someone had taken my entire world and shifted the axis just enough for everything to fall out of place\u2014it felt like someone took my fully lived in home and tilted it just far enough for everything to fall off the shelves, for the furniture to shift and fall from its place, and left me in the center of the mess of broken and displaced items. I was only nineteen at the time. While i had lost a couple of friends and some other more distant family members, it was the first truly big, profound death in my life. It changed me. \n\nI thought I knew grief. I thought that when someone else close to me died, it would hurt, but that I knew the landscape. That although it would be painful, it would be less shocking, somehow less confusing, less complicated. I was wrong. \n\nMy family lives in another state. I came home last Friday, and have been adrift. Two weeks and three days isn\u2019t that long, but it may as well have been an eternity. My friends are supportive, but there\u2019s nothing they can really do. My boyfriend was initially supportive while I was gone, but acted like a colossal ass this past weekend, so I have barely spoken to him since Sunday night. He has been slammed with work, so I have been largely left alone. He clearly expects me to do the work of facilitating a conversation to \u201cfix\u201d it, and I don\u2019t have the energy. I can\u2019t be bothered to care enough. My brother is dead, and your meetings, your small inconveniences, your excuses for being a jerk are meaningless to me. Maybe that\u2019s not fair. But neither is this situation. Neither is life. \n\nMy sleep schedule is fucked. Remembering to eat is impossible, and even when I somehow manage it, I sometimes skip a meal anyway because everything sounds terrible. I don\u2019t want anything. I just want my brother back. I want more time\u2014more time to resolve conflicts, more time to tell him I love him, more time to beg him to get help, more time to tell him he\u2019s an asshole and fight with him, because at least if we are fighting it means he\u2019s still here. \n\nSibling grief is complicated. When you lose a parent, or when a parent loses a child, or a spouse loses their partner, the impact is obvious. Undeniable. But the loss of someone you grew up with, who walked alongside you from the beginning, who was a built in comrade and collaborator, sometimes competition, sometimes more frenemy than friend, is devastating. It\u2019s a different loss than that of my dad, that\u2019s true. But it is not less. And somehow I thought it would be less. \n\nI can\u2019t stop crying, and the planet keeps spinning as if nothing happened at all. I want to scream, can\u2019t you see that everything is different? Can\u2019t you see that now nothing will be the same? \n\nPeople die every day, even people who are far better persons than my brother ever was, and the world doesn\u2019t stop for them. Why would it stop for him? This is the nature of things, and death is as natural and fundamental to living as is breathing and eating and loving. But I still want to scream.

It started with them calling my mother's ex-husband and trying to involve him in the funeral. He's my biological father, but he's been very cruel to my mother and my sister and I, and I don't see him as a father (if that helps any backstory). He donated money to my mother's funeral as his 'way to say goodbye and do the right thing' as what I know from mutual people who were friends with my father's family and friends with my mom. We were worried that it would mean he was going to try to invite himself to family functions afterward. I understand logically that we couldn't stop him from attending the funeral because it is public. It does just suck because he abused her for so long. \n\nThe funeral was over the top with things we didn't need or want, but my mom had put my aunt (her sister) and my uncle (her brother) in charge of getting things done so my sister and I wouldn't have to worry about it. She was diagnosed 4 years ago almost 5 and has been doing very good up until this past Feb-march. That's when we were told treatment was not working &amp; she declined fairly rapidly after that until she passed May 5. \n\nMy uncle &amp; his wife (the sister-in-law) invited my father to her celebration of life when that was a private family function, so it's not like it was public and just anyone could show up. We told her last night we were upset about that and she turned it around on us. She said that our mother (who is passed) put a bad taste in our mouths about our father, but maybe what we're telling her about him is true - she doesn't know. Then went onto say that we had 4 years to save for her funeral and it's basically our fault.\n\nWe didn't expect to see a funeral for 4 years. Just the last 3-4 months. I'm just absolutely disgusted and I feel gross, because my mother had trusted these people to be kind. The petty part of me wants to go find the bill and pay them back with whatever I have in small coins. Had we just cremated her and not rented a coffin or had a private viewing or any of the small little stuff, the price would have come down significantly. However, that's what they wanted. I'm just really hurt and angry by that statement. Logically yeah we should have started saving, but treatments were working and we just didn't think we'd get to this point.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I didn't (and don't) want to die, but I didn't want to feel that loss anymore.\n\nI know some of the things that are supposed to help with grief. A few months before my friend died, I was in a short-lived relationship with someone whose father passed away a few weeks prior, and I devoted all my down time to looking up how to help someone through grief. I know one of the things that supposedly helps is talking to other people who knew and loved the deceased, sharing your memories with them....\n\nMy friend lived in a different state. We met in person only once. That didn't matter to either of us. He was always there, on the other end of the phone, through every joy I celebrated and every struggle I ever went through, for almost ten years. But because of the distance, I can't \"share memories\" with the people who knew and loved him. I don't know those people. I met some of his friends the night I met him, and we've stayed in touch over Facebook, but we're not close, and they're *actively grieving* my friend, who they had many more years with and (no matter how close our friendship was) were even closer to. How can I possibly call them to whine about how much I miss him?\n\nThis is all a jumbled mess of thoughts. I've been meaning to post for a while now.\n\nSometimes... I want to call the police officer (their name was listed in the news report) who arrived on the scene, and ask about my friend. He never even made it to the hospital, he died on the scene. I want to know - and DON'T want to know - of what? Was it instant? Did he feel any pain? Did he know? \n\nSometimes, I want to read the police report. Is that fucked-up of me? \n\nI work for a personal injury lawyer. I see police reports almost every day. The day after my friend died, we got a new case - a motorcycle wreck, of all things. The police report had the wrong box checked, so our client was incorrectly listed as a fatality. I had a crying fit/panic attack so severe I had to run to the bathroom. When I realized the report was wrong and the client was still alive, I was so relieved. The client turned out to be a complete and utter dick. That doesn't mean he deserves anything bad to happen to him, no, but it fucked me up that a mean-spirited dick of an old man could get hit on his motorcycle and not only survive, but walk away from it richer, thanks to a nice fat lawsuit; meanwhile, my sweet, caring friend, who lived less than half the years the old man has, gets hit on his motorcycle and that's it. He's gone. Working where I do, I've seen good people with horrific, life-altering injuries get hefty financial compensation for their pain and suffering. I've also seen shitty, greedy people exaggerating minor injuries or prolonging medical treatments to drive up their costs and sue for a higher sum - and since my friend died, I *hate* them. I hate how ridiculously fucking unfair and arbitrary it is that a car/bike wreck can make you rich or it can kill you. And it killed my friend.\n\nSomething about seeing that incorrectly written report the day after my friend died, and seeing the end of someone's whole life reduced to a checkbox on a report, fucked me up. Then, realizing it was incorrect, I wished I could just White-Out the Fatalities box on my friend's police report and it would bring him back.\n\nSorry this post turned out longer than I thought it would. I don't actually want answers to my questions about my friend's final moments. I just want to know... why do I want to read the police report? Why do I want to contact the police officer? Has anyone done this? Does it actually help?\n\nThanks for reading.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My father has been slowly getting worse since he had his first heart attack almost 15 years ago. There's been a joke in my family that if it were any other man he'd be gone by now, but my dad is a fighter. (He really isn't, he's been forthright about wanting to die for a while). My dad has undergone two heart surgeries. His kidneys are failing now. He can no longer breathe without oxygen, and he cannot control his bowels. My mom has been taking care of him, but she's older and can't do it anymore. When he's released from the hospital he's going to hospice this time. I grew up a \"daddy's girl\" but there were times where I was angry at him for long periods of time, and I regret that now.\n\nHere's a tidbit about me. My grandmother was like a third parent to me. She lived with us and raised us just like my mom and dad did. She passed away when I was in the 6th grade (I'm 32), and I've never gotten over it. I've never had a family member who was dying, only a family member who died suddenly (only my grandmother). So this is very new to me, and knowing how hard my grandmother's death was on me, I have no idea how to handle my father dying. I live almost 3 hours away, but I'm trying to go see him as much as possible. I don't currently work, so it's a lot easier now than if I did.\n\nMy husband is a wonderful support person, but I still feel alone. Being home alone all day, Reddit has really become a source of entertainment and contemplation as silly as that may sound. So, I figured I'd post my feelings here. I'm already grieving my father who has not yet passed away, and I don't know how to handle it.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My brother and I never really knew what person we were going to come home from school to. 90% of the time she would be a very loving and generous person, and the remaining 10% she would become enraged because a sock was on the floor. It causes you to never fully trust anyone.\nIn 2012 my brother and his fianc\u00e9 were involved in a horrible boating accident where a man lost his life and a lady was horribly and permanently injured. This was the beginning of the worst season of life I could ever imagine.\nThe case dragged on in the courts for over 6 years. During that time the stress of it sent my mother deeper into a Bipolar abyss. A little over two years ago it turned into full blown paranoia. She was constantly attacking my father, blaming him for every little made-up thing she felt wrong in her life. Eventually in July 2017 she fell into a manic state and began calling everyone telling them my father was stalking her. It got to the point that I had to drive to her house about 3 hours away and ultimately have her committed via what they call a 1013 in Georgia. I had to ride with her in the back of a police car to the hospital because she refused to ride in the ambulance. She was in a treatment facility for over about 2 weeks.\n\nAfter she left the facility she had agreed to see a therapist who was the head of psychology at the local medical school. A person that, on paper, was as qualified as you would want. My Dad took her to her first appointment and she put on a show as we would call it. Blaming everything on Dad. It was apparently so convincing that he told her she didn\u2019t need to be on the meds that had been prescribed. She immediately went home and flushed them all down the toilet.\nI wrote the doctor a very long email explaining the situation giving him the completely picture from the family\u2019s perspective, near the end of my note I wrote:\n\n\u201cWe talked to my father after the appointment at your office today. He is completely and utterly crushed and feels totally helpless and I am honestly deeply concerned for his well being. I have never heard him this sorrowful and dejected and that is saying quite a bit given what he has been through for the past several months. She has flushed all of her medication down the toilet; we feel like we have been set back to the very beginning of this whole thing.\u201d\n\nAfter much back and forth he agreed to an appointment with our whole family in two days. My, Dad, my Brother and me.\nWe arrived and, despite her gaslighting, he diagnosed her as Bipolar Hypomanic and provided her meds with a plan to monitor their effectiveness through bloodtests, but she was compliant for only a few days. At this point she became even worse. She stepped up her attacks on my Dad, she was making his life miserable. He lost so much weight, wasn\u2019t sleeping, but refused to leave her side for longer than a couple of days. She finally served him with divorce papers on 9/22/17 (they had been married for over 40 years), Dad was dejected but my brother and I vowed to do everything in our power to continue to get things right because we knew she was only trying to hurt him. \n\nOn the morning of 9/25 my father killed himself in the backyard of their home. My Dad was the sweetest, most loving and most gentle person I will ever know. He loved my mom unconditionally to the moment he pulled the trigger. He just lost all hope of things ever getting better.\n\nThat very next day my brother was checked into a hospital and was diagnosed with MRSA. He would remain in the hospital for several weeks while I worked to plan Dad\u2019s services.\nDuring one of my trips to their home I arranged for an appointment with Mom and her \u2018Pshychotherapist\u2019. I wanted to make sure Mom was receiving the appropriate treatment. It was during this meeting that this doctor proceeded to tell me that my Dad killed himself because he couldn\u2019t handle the thought of living without my Mom and that he had driven her away by not being affectionate or communicating enough. He said that in these situations he always recommends that people go home and read the Bible. Needless to say, I had my answer, she was not getting treated for what she suffered from.\n\nMoving ahead several weeks, my brother was finally released from the hospital and we had Dad\u2019s services. I eulogized him twice. I still really miss him.\n\nFor a time my brother and I would support each other, with the help of family and friends. In July of the next year, my brother\u2019s boat accident case was finally settled. He submitted an Alford plea whereby he would accept 1 year of house arrest and probation while maintaining innocence. He was really struggling at this time, we were both still reeling from the loss of Dad and honestly didn\u2019t know what dealing with grief truly meant, he was drinking and displaying self destructive tendencies. I would communicate with him to tell him that we needed to really get him help and that the time will pass quickly. The night of 10/15/18 he and his wife (who happens to be a very good friend of my then girlfriend/partner) had a fight, she slept downstairs and my brother took multiple different drugs from benedryl to 3-4 benzodiazepines and anti-depressants. He died of an overdose at some point the morning of 10/16. My sister in law called me at 6 am to tell me she had been performing CPR and he was cold. My girlfriend and I rushed up there, about halfway she got a call tell her that my brother had been pronounced dead. I got there in time to say goodbye and watched them wheel him into the coroner van. I still have a hard time expressing the devastation I felt. I started to call different people to tell them what had happened. \n\nI called my aunt (my mother\u2019s sister in law), there was a really unsual pause in the conversation after I told her. She said to me, \u2018I need to tell you something, a week ago your mother attempted suicide at home. She took a bunch of Xanax and when that didn\u2019t work she cut open both arteries in her arms. She has been in a facility since being released from the hospital. We promised her we wouldn\u2019t tell you guys until she had completed treatment and was home\u2019 So within a matter of hours I had found out that my brother had died (I feel like intentionally or apathetically, despite the coroner report) and my mother had tried to and my brother, I guess fortunately, never knew. I had to go to her mental health facility and tell her that her youngest son had died.\n\nMom was released from the facility about a week later. She went right back into a Bipolar mania. She was breaking things around the house, tearing up my photos, blaming everyone for the death or her son. I was trying to plan my brother\u2019s funeral with the threat of my mother blowing the entire thing up. She was calling and threatening anyone she could think of, to the point that several of our close family friends said that they weren\u2019t going to be able to make it to his funeral. We even had to hire police at the funeral home. I spoke with her on 10/30, 3 days prior to the services, in an attempt to get her to snap back to reality and see if she would be able to be ok at the service (this was the last time I communicated with my mother). The very next day, she called the police and told them she had a prowler. When they arrived they found my mother holed up in her attic. When she came down she assaulted the police officers by discharging a fire extinguisher in their face. They ultimately took her into custody and she was again 1013\u2019d. This time they continued to extend her stay as much as possible, through 3 different facilities, because she was clearly unstable. She missed my brother\u2019s funeral and was finally released in early December when a judge ruled that she was competent to go home, despite the recommendation of every doctor and caregiver. She went home and my only updates are from people that see her around town, she wont talk to any family.  A good friend helped me plan the service, I eulogized my little brother.\n\nMy brother and I shared several friends. There was one in particular that he was very close to, a friend I went to high school and college with and we were roommates for going on 10 years after college. A few years ago he had developed a mysterious medical condition that caused him severe intestinal pain amongst other things. He would be ok for a few months but then would be effectively sidelined for weeks. He had moved to his parents\u2019 home for a time until he was actually doing much better, buying a home, connecting with old high school friends, being his normal hilarious self. He was devastated by my brother\u2019s death. We were in contact fairly regularly (he lived a solid hour away from me so it was primarily by text). On 5/6/19 I got a call from him, I was on a conference call and wasn\u2019t able to answer, so I texted him to let him know that. A few minutes later I got a message from another high school friend, my friend had killed himself in his backyard. Along with several of his other close friends, I eulogized my friend of 28 years.\n\nSo within the span of 22 months, I had to have my mother committed (for the first of many times) and my father, my brother and my dear friend all killed themselves (whether or not you feel like my brother was intentional/apathetic, he still did it himself).\n\nFinally, I have been with my current girlfriend for over 7 years. We have seen and done so much together, we were really good partners in life. Just the other night we sit down to dinner and she tells me basically that my grieving process has precluded her from having the fun and excitement she craves in her life. That she had been considering asking for an open relationship since shortly after my brother died. She told me that she puts a premium on looking forward to the unknown and that the depth we had created in all of our life experiences together were not that compelling, so what do I think we need to do about it. I know this is going to come across as defensive, but I was always very aware that I needed to make sure that I didn\u2019t crawl into a ball and become an unfeeling mass of flesh, but it was a struggle to enjoy things for a while there.  We made time to do things we enjoy and continue to be connected.\n\nSo, now, I don\u2019t know what is going to happen. I don\u2019t have an immediate family and the person I had built a really deep  connection with through shared experience and I thought would fill that role, now says they might not want to be in a relationship. \n\nIm fortunate my professional life is going well, so I try to focus there, but its hard to be productive when the slow destruction of your personal life is nearly complete.\n\nThank you for reading this.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My mother died at the end of May. Usually I am fine, but this one thing keeps sneaking up on me. My mother had many health problems, and I had spent the last three years helping her etc as much as I could. i live four hours away, my sibling is out of state. At the beginning of May she had to go into a nursing home/ rehab facility to await a back procedure. She was supposed to be there for a week and a half, but long story short she died of pneumonia three and half weeks later. I had taken off time from work to visit her when she first went in. I was always taking time off work to help her. She first told me she had pneumonia about a week and a half after her admittance. Here is where I feel guilty. My brother and I had come up with a shared responsibilty plan sort of thing. I have always been the legs on the ground because I live closer, which sometimes I resented. So he said he would do all the calls etc with the doctors and nursing staff, and I would take time off work and go up as needed. I took what mom told me about the pneumonia to him, he said he would talk to them. They denied she had it. In fact they lied about a lot of things, and I am not entirely sure what to do about that either. They told us her cancer had spread (later scans showed her tumors were shrinking), she had dementia etc. As she got sicker she was very inchoerent, and I just took what my brother was saying (from their mouths) at face value. Though sometimes I felt like something wasn't right. By the time we both figured out what was happening it was too late. We had her transferred to a real hospital, but they couldn't save her. I keep thinking \"why didn't I go back up even a week earlier?\", and the honest truth was that I was tired. I had been going back and forth for three years, and on the phone with my mother everyday. I loved my mother, I did it all willingly, but at this point I had just gone up and was tired.

I asked DH if MIL even knew my mom died, that\u2019s how little contact there was. My FIL (they are divorced) who is at times a royal pain in the ass, was super kind and compassionate. But nothing from MIL.\n\nWe are visiting MIL now (she lives a few states away from us), and the minute we got here she hugs me and goes \u201coh, I was so sad to hear your bad news\u201d in this weird syrupy sing song voice that\u2019s nothing like what she normally sounds like. So...I knew I was in for a weird conversation. \n\nThen, a few minutes later, she asks how my dad is doing and when I tell her that he\u2019s having a tough time because they were married for 50 years, she cuts me off and goes, \u201cwell, at least your mom didn\u2019t die drooling on herself in a nursing home. I could never do that.\u201d I mean...yes, we are all very grateful that she died at home, but she did have Parkinson\u2019s and was in fact frequently drooling on herself, along with all the other indignities involved. I know my mom is in a better place, I truly do, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m cool with hearing comments about how quickly MIL would demand we \u201cpull the plug\u201d on her if she ever loses quality of life. It\u2019s like, believe me lady, no one wants to die the way my mom did, and as Parkinson\u2019s patients go, she got off easy.\n\nThen she launches into some stuff about how her neighbor\u2019s husband \u201ctook two years to croak\u201d. Yes, friends, she used the word croak.\n\nMy MIL has never been known for her tact, and I knew I was in for some weird shit, but this was even stranger than I expected. We\u2019re here for a few days and I know it\u2019s really important for DH and DD to have this time with his mom, but I don\u2019t think I was mentally ready to come here and listen to her brag about how healthy she is, like it\u2019s some fucking accomplishment. \n\nOk, I guess that was a rant.

Both my SO and child we present, though my kid got sent home (we live across the street) when my SO felt something was wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, the issue we're having is finding others to grieve with. We're not family, so we are not comfortable talking to them about it much. We were friendly with them but not super close. My SO is having a much harder time with this as she was present and the one to call 911. She feels a deep trauma, but also frequently feels like she doesn't deserve to feel that way since we weren't family. Part of it was being on the scene, despite not seeing anything.

Part of it is the jarring nature of it all. \n\n\n\n\n\nI know it's a long shot but does anyone here have anything similar?

I've had losses with death and with other areas of my life and I am getting to point where I am not sure I can take it anymore. I am not trying to be a snowflake on here where I think things and opportunities should just be handed to me. I know how to work hard to get what I want but my luck seems to be running out. I will give you the rundown. \n\nI've posted here before. I lost my Dad over 8 years ago to stomach cancer when I was 27, he was 65. Out of the blue it came and got him, we had 5 months left on this earth together and I think about it every single day. My Mom never got over it and right after my Dad's death she became ill herself and has been suffering with COPD from years of smoking. I am thankful she doesn't have cancer, but watching her get worse and become this old lady before my eyes has been quite a number of grieving moments in and of itself. I went through many of the stages of grief and I still go through them to this day, but one of the stages has never left me and that is anger. Anger seems to be a new friend of mine I carry with me in all aspects of my life from personal to work and I cannot seem to shake it. I am angry cancer took my Dad. I am angry my Mom decided to cope with his death by smoking herself to almost death and now burdening me with taking care of her and her affairs. She has been hospitalized 6 times since 2012 and the last two she came extremely close to dying. I put boundaries between us, but I still have a sense of guilt. I should mention I am an only child.\n\nAnother loss. We are coming to this time of selling my childhood home, which I have had an odd relationship with since my Dad's passing. At first, I couldn't stand to be there. It was not a familiar place anymore. Then through the grief it became a refuge. And finally, two years ago it became a place my Mom could no longer live in for her health and safety. And here we are the final stop on this part of the journey of cleaning out 35+ years of memories and the thought of someone else living there makes me sick to my stomach.\n\nAnother loss. Myself. Me. Who am I? As I get older meeting people is harder. Friends or even boyfriends. It seems as I age I have less friends by way of falling outs, logistics, or just organic means to no one's fault. I know that some of this is life but it is magnified by the losses I have experienced. Some people say to me, \"You have gone through a lot for someone your age.\" And you know what? That actually makes me feel even worse. I am 35 and I was hoping by this age I would be married with at least a kid or two and I am not. I am single as ever. I see my friends getting married and now starting to have children and I am just lagging behind them. I am standing on the pier while they all sail into the sunset. The day will come when I will be phased out because I will be the middle aged Auntie who gets invited of pity not because I have a 3 year old their kid can play with while we sit over on the side drinking wine or whatever. When I hear good news for people I know I pretend to be happy for them. I can't genuinely be happy for them because I am not happy for myself. And how shitty of a thing is that to say? It makes me shitty to behave in such a manner, but after being beat down one loss after another it's hard to be happy for anyone. Some may say I am jealous, and that is fine if you want to label it that, but I bring it back to the anger thing.\n\nWhen will I start gaining? Because, as I stated in the beginning, I am not sure I can take this anymore. I am dying on the inside. I'm dying on the inside and no one knows.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I know what's happening.\n\nHusband's come up, and the aid's coming, and I run around to the opposite side of the hospice bed, and I take her wrist, and I check for a pulse there.

My husband wipes her mouth. There's a pulse oximeter on the coffee table; I grab it, and stick it on her finger. It's not picking up anything.\n\nI take it off. I pace. Husband grabs me. \"Hey,\" he says, \"take a deep breath.\" He places a hand on her chest. He says he can feel something. \n\nThe aid touches Mom's legs. \"She's cold.\"\n\nHusband: \"I'll turn the air conditioner down.\"\n\nI try to find Mom's pulse again. The aid asks me if I'm getting anything.\n\n\"I can't find it.\"\n\nThe aid starts trying to rouse her. I put the oximeter back on her finger, and the aid tells me to put it on her thumb.\n\nNothing. Nothing. The meter rises and falls, searching, failing. \n\nIn my gut, already, I know. I know.\n\nMom's color is draining and the aid can't find a pulse, either. \"I think she's going,\" the aid says. And then, \"I think she's left.\"\n\n6 hours and 55 minutes ago.

Both my parents died within 25 months, my Dad in February 2017 and my mom in March. I was adopted at a very young age, 6 months, and they raised me instead of my biological mom, who is one of their kids. My Dad and I had a very close relationship until I was 23 and moved into an apartment with my girlfriend (now my wife). My parents took my leaving hard and often said that I chose her and her family over them. Which isn't so, but it was really hard not to take that to heart at the time. Since then, I called them out on it and they assured me that they loved my now wife and never felt that way. All this is making a point, I promise. Anyways, my first week of the second semester of graduate school, which was in 2011, my Dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, my Mom was his primary care giver. He didn't really progress heavily till another 2 years. Since then I've gotten married, graduated college and started a full time job, which I'm still st. However, all of those have left me empty inside since and part of that is depression. Both of my folks were in their 60s at this point. I have four older siblings who are at least 18 years older than me, two of my sisters and one of my brothers lived near them and the other brother lives near me. This is already a long story but I feel like I lost myself in my relationship and wasn't there for my Dad and Mom like I felt I should be. In the last few years, I realized my wife and I are extremely codependent and I was honestly unhappy the last few years of our relationship while my Dad's health declined. My mom was never one to ask for help and I thought things were okay and she didn't need me, while I was trying to build a career and fix my marriage, he died and then 2 years later, my Mom died unexpectedly. I feel like such an ungrateful child, they sacrificed everything for me to grow up and go to college and be successful and I feel like I abandoned them. Now I look at my wife and feel such resentment, like I chose her over them. To the naked eye, this is ridiculous, but this is how I feel right now. I had something special with my folks that I will never have again, and I think it's part of the reason some of my siblings resent me and have shamed me for not being there enough for my folks. Between my parents dying, my mother in law died unexpectedly, so my wife is dealing as well. All of this has put a damper on a relationship that hasn't been good for awhile. We are both trying to be good for each other and it feels incredibly lonely. I just wish my Mom and my Dad were to help me navigate all of this. I feel so utterly alone, scared, and frightened. I'm 32 years old and have no idea how to parent myself. Thanks to those who read this. Please be kind, grief, complicated grief especially, is a fucked up mix bag, and I just needed to get this out to someone before I isolate myself even further.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

And as their mom I\u2019ve been consoling my 3 kids (12, 9, 6 1/2) all day and I need to tell someone out there how much pain I feel too. I had to make the decision to put down my 12 year old dog (cancer) years ago and it was devastating, but this pain is much worse since it\u2019s unexpected. She just turned 5 and she was the best dog I ever had, she was the first dog that was \u201cmine\u201d- she knew I was her mommy and followed me everywhere and loved me the most. My kids cherished her, she cuddled with them all day and was the sweetest 8 lb dog you ever met. When my last dog died, I didn\u2019t think any dog could ever be better for me, but somehow this foster dog ended up being my family\u2019s best friend. \n\nShe was outside relaxing in her chair while we got ready to celebrate my daughter\u2019s birthday and I couldn\u2019t find her. I thought maybe the gardener left gate open, so my husband went outside to look and found her floating in the deep end of the pool and yelled for me. I was able to keep kids inside so they didn\u2019t see too. I checked my cameras and she had drowned 20 mins before. The gardener was in the backyard at the time, he didn\u2019t even notice. She was near the deep end and was looking in another direction, one foot misplaced and she tipped into pool. She panicked and forgot where to get out. She\u2019s 8lb so she couldn\u2019t just lift herself out in deep end. She didn\u2019t bark. It was quick. I don\u2019t know why I watched the video, but somehow I felt better- like she wasn\u2019t begging for help and ignored. No one could have saved her. It was just a tragic accident and it gave me some comfort. I\u2019m not mad or angry. \n\nMy heart is broken though. I always thought she would die of old age, not by drowning. She didn\u2019t deserve this. She was so innocent and loving. I wish it wasn\u2019t this way. And I can\u2019t take the pain away, my kids are hurting, she was their best friend. I can\u2019t make it better. I feel bad that it was on my kid\u2019s birthday too, we didn\u2019t celebrate at all and they cried for most of the last 9 hours until they fell asleep.   \n\nI\u2019ve lost my father to suicide so I know time heals all wounds, but for some reason that doesn\u2019t help me today and seeing my kids cry. I\u2019m grateful for 5 wonderful years with her, I just wish it could have been longer. RIP my sweet Willow, I\u2019m sorry this happened to you.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

We were waiting on a new heart for her, but after a stroke and bleeding to the brain, there was nothing that could be done. We all got to mourn her the best way you can with lots of crying, time to tell her that we loved her though we weren\u2019t sure she could hear us, and we held her hand as she passed away at about 9 AM after late rites were performed. \n\nI don\u2019t know if she knew she was dying. One day, the doctor was putting her on the critical list and she was giving him the thumbs up. The next she was dead. I know there were times where she knew she could die, but I don\u2019t think she was ready. I wonder if she was scared that afternoon that she fell unconscious. I stayed with her until 12 that afternoon until I had to go to therapy. I spent the evening with someone until midnight. On my way home, my father called me frantically saying we needed to go to the hospital and I already suspected it was the end. \n\nI wish I hadn\u2019t left that day. I wish I wasn\u2019t with some stupid boy that night. At the very least, I wish I had left therapy and gone to see her again. It wouldn\u2019t have done anything but I just wish. \n\nAnd I\u2019m having these flashes of her last few months. How in September I was student teaching and sleeping 3 hours a night as I struggled. There were many times I denied her, \u201cMom, I can\u2019t I have to finish this lesson plan.\u201d What a stupid excuse especially because I couldn\u2019t stick it out anyways. I ended up mental and in a psych ward. We had to cancel our trip to her sister\u2019s. That could\u2019ve been the last time she went up to Vermont. Lord knows she missed opportunities to go up for a whole year because I was working or she was sick. Instead, she was visiting me in the loony bin.\n\nThen I have flashes of all the times she wanted me to eat. I don\u2019t know what happened in August, but I was at a BBQ for work and it just started with taking only some chicken, veggies, and denying myself the cookie. Didn\u2019t think much of it, just seemed like the healthy choice. I only ate at most 500 calories a day after that. \n\nAnd I kept lying to her about eating dinner or \u201cI had a big lunch\u201d, \u201cI ate at home\u201d. She knew something was wrong. I dropped 25 lbs by January. She was in shock. She was proud, but always warned about Karen Carpenter and how I needed to be careful. I specifically remember this one time in September when she was in the hospital. She was eating peanut M&amp;Ms\u2014her favorite. She asked if I wanted any and of course I said no. But now all I can think is that every time I said no to a handful of M&amp;Ms I was saying no to her, to being with her. \n\nI remember when she got some candy for Christmas and we had to sneak it to her because the hospital was strict about her diet. I tried to let her have a little of each kind, but my dad cut her off. \u201cWhat are sweet twists?\u201d I remember her asking as I pulled the box away. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna get her in trouble,\u201d Dad said. \u201cWhat are sweet twists?\u201d she yelled. \n\nMom, I never ate those sweet twists, even when I started binge eating after you died, because you never got one. \n\nThese flashes keep playing over and over again in my mind along with memories from before all this. Mom bought these exercise tapes when I was in high school and it came with a stupid thing called a wave board. She looked silly trying to balance on it, but it was the last time I remember her being that mobile. And she was laughing. \n\nI keep seeing the quiet concern she always held in her eyes when she looked at me. I keep hearing her laugh\u2014how it came out in little chuckles or big ferocious ones so strong a sound barely came out. I remember her eye rolls and the \u201care you fucking kidding me?\u201d face, the tone she\u2019d take when we were all being \u201ctoo stupid to function\u201d. She wanted things her way. She was feisty. Being sick took that out of her. In her final week, she cried, just wanting to quit work and be taken care of for once instead of worrying about everyone else. And I wanted to make that happen if it meant working myself to exhaustion again. \n\nHere I am\u2014without her. There\u2019s no one to help take a bath or change a dressing. There\u2019s no one to flush an IV for or charge a battery for a device. There\u2019s no one when things get tough and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do, there\u2019s no one to watch Hallmark Christmas movies, there\u2019s no one to tell me they love me when I cry. \n\nThere\u2019s no Mom. There\u2019s no one to talk to about Mom. I reached for my phone tonight, racking my brain on who to talk to and there was no one.

It was fairly unexpected. She had been in and out of the hospital for a few months, but finally seemed to be on the mend. When I received the call the morning of, I cried for a few minutes, but I was watching my 2 year old and didn\u2019t want her to wonder what was going on with dad. I pulled myself together and got on with my day. I called my wife to let her know, and again, I got a little choked up, but maintained. That night after work, the only one awake in the house, I was fully expecting to finally break down about it, but strangely I didn\u2019t. About 4 days later was the funeral. I knew it was going to be rough, and it was. I could only take brief glances at the casket, because I knew if I looked too long and reflected, I\u2019d lose it in front of my wife and parents, and I didn\u2019t want to do that. I sat through the visitation and viewing, the occasional tear eeking out, but that was it. I figured after all this, when I was finally alone, I could get it all out. But again I didn\u2019t. And I still haven\u2019t. I\u2019m starting to have the dreams where I\u2019m back at her house, and she\u2019s there, but I know she shouldn\u2019t be.

I was moving later that morning, and I was determined to get everything squared away before my boyfriend and his family arrived at 10 AM to help me move my larger furniture items. I stepped outside to pack another load of clothing and my brother, along with his girlfriend (both 20), were getting into their car. I was so busy packing and he was so busy leaving that we just nodded at each other, and he said \u201chey\u201d, to which I returned with a \u201chey\u201d of my own. They got into the car. I went back inside. That was the last I spoke to him. \n\nAt 9:16 AM, there was a pounding on my door. My dog was going nuts, and I remember being irritated as I got up. It was 14 minutes until my alarm was supposed to go off, and having gone to sleep at 5 AM, I was desperate for every last minute of sleep. I pulled on my clothes and peeked through the curtains as I approached my door. I saw the unmistakable uniform of a state trooper. \n\nThey asked for my mother when I opened the door. She lived upstairs in a separate apartment from mine and I was concerned. Three weeks prior she\u2019d gotten a speeding ticket for rushing me to the hospital, which the responding officer had promised to drop if she\u2019d shown up with my discharge papers. She had, but I\u2019d thought maybe there was some miscommunication. \n\nI asked why they were there; they wouldn\u2019t tell me. They asked for her again. I said I didn\u2019t know if she was home, but that I would check. She wasn\u2019t, but her husband was. I trailed him back down to where the officers were waiting. \n\nThey asked him if my brother lived there. He said yes. They held out a picture and asked if it was my brother. He said yes. I thought maybe my brother was in trouble, or that he\u2019d done something. But then they said it. \n\nI don\u2019t remember the exact wording now. It\u2019s all a bit of a blur. But it was something along the lines of, \u201che was involved in a car accident early this morning, in which he was the passenger. He died on scene.\u201d\n\nIt took a second for that to sink in. It was just the very last thing I was expecting, you know? I\u2019d just seen him a few hours ago. I remember immediately falling because my knees gave out. I remember sobbing \u201cno\u201d and maybe \u201cplease\u201d. I remember my stepfather explaining that I was his sister. I remember how stoic the cop looked. \n\nMy mom had been on her way home during this conversation, and when she arrived and they told her, she screamed. I imagine the whole neighborhood heard her. \n\nThe officer assigned to the crash could only tell us that it was an ongoing investigation. We gained the most information from the coroner, the tow company, and the news websites. \n\nWe gathered that my brother had been a passenger, with his girlfriend driving his car. We don\u2019t know where they were going. They were on a narrow, dark rode and were eastbound on a curving hill when, at 4:30 AM, my brothers car crossed the centerline and smashed head-on into an oncoming car. \n\nMy brother and his girlfriend died on scene, according to the news. Another site stated that a third car hit them shortly after the crash, and that my brother and his girlfriend \u201clater died\u201d of their injuries. I think that means that he suffered. \n\nWe have a meeting with the funeral home tomorrow. My mom is heartbroken and devastated. None of us expected to have to make arrangements and bury a 20 year old. He and his girlfriend\u2019s dog just lays on our deck and waits for them to come home. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t know how to cope with this. I don\u2019t know how to come back from it. I have no desire to finish this last semester of college, no desire to move an hour away from my mom now even though I have to, no desire to shower or eat or do anything but drink and cry. \n\nI keep thinking that if only I\u2019d stopped longer to talk to him, maybe they wouldn\u2019t have ever encountered that car. \n\nEveryone keeps telling me to let them know if they can do anything for me. But they can\u2019t. They can\u2019t bring him back. Neither can I. That\u2019s the worst part.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I have friends and family that know my other account.\n\nIt's been over 70 days since I lost my Dad. I've been pushing through everything, trying to be the stability for my Mom and my younger brother. It's hard because I live a distance away. My brother's coping mechanism is to frantically run from one \"busy\" thing to another; I'm worried about him but there's not much I can do but to reach out. He doesn't answer (too busy) but there are family members watching out for him. My Mom hasn't had much chance to grieve yet. I never realized that a constant barrage of well-meaning people tends to put everything on hold for the bereaved. She's had very little time to herself since he passed, and it's starting to wear on her. She doesn't want to say anything that may hurt friends and family that are constantly stopping by; she understands they're hurting, too. It's a frustrating situation.\n\nI am having a harder time coping with this than I thought I would have. I find myself staying up very late at night, just so I can silently cry and not disturb or upset my husband (not that he would be angry; he would just feel helpless.)\n\nI feel guilty immediately after smiling or laughing, because how *could* I. My Dad is gone. \n\nAs time passes, I feel more and more anxious. I kept my loss to myself, telling only a few people. After surviving the first wave of \"I'm sorry for your loss\"es, I've been able to process things a little more completely and have occasions where I feel absolutely overwhelmed with grief. But the time for mourning has passed. People wouldn't understand, and I don't want to talk to anyone about something so profound. I don't want to feel, and yet I do. People tell me I should be happy for him, because he's in a better place, which I find to be ludicrous because with his family is where he's supposed to be. They tell me that grief is just feeling sorry for myself, because I miss him. That strikes me as a rather cruel thing to say, and a very shallow way of looking at things.\n\nI want to cherish my memories of him. I desperately do. The moment I try to think of happier times, the shock of the entire process of arrangements, notifications, phone calls, letters and the sheer physicality of his dying hit me as though it happened a half hour ago. So I guess I'm not ready for even memories yet.\n\nThis is exhausting. Pretending to be fine, continuing with work and life as normal. I am slow to process this. Slow to find my feet. I have to help my family, so I press onward.\n\nI guess I'm trying this out to see if it helps at all. I can't see myself going to some sort of grief counselor; I can't speak of this to friends and family, and the idea of talking to a stranger about such an intimate event in my life is horrifying.

We were talking about music. We had different tastes but we were discussing some universally admired artists, asking each other favorite songs and playing them for each other.

For me, grieve came in waves. For me, at first, I was drowning in it. Then it was just painful, but not unbearable, then it would hit me only once in a while. Seeing a happy kid with their parents would usually do it.  Then less and less.\n\nI'm back in it right now. It hurts. It's not been letting up for a while now, tough. I know it will get better, but for the moment, I think it will help me to write about it. \n\nThank you for this space.\n\nA week ago I was playing a video game with a friend, and a terrible turd named Todd was introduced in the game. She made a joke about how all Todds are terrible, and I ended up recounting an anecdote about what it's like to grow up with that name in Germany. The German word for death is Tod. \"Class, meet your new school mate, Death\". I was always terribly embarrassed by it, and that experience was not something I would want my child to go through. \n\nAnd then it hit me that if my daughter was still alive she would have gone through pretty much the same exact experience, because her mom named her Isis. This what might have is, I think, when it started. \n\nI'm thinking about the profound positive impact she had on me. My parents weren't great role models. I didn't grow up with a template for love, not a healthy kind, and I knew that. I didn't know if I could be a good dad. I wanted kids then, but I was afraid that I was just going to end up passing down my issues. The largest part of me had therefore decided not to have kids. \n\nWhen I found out that I had a daughter, almost a year after she was born, something incredible happened that changed my life forever. Instant unconditional love just struck me. Like a lightning strike, out of nowhere. I wanted to do anything, was willing to sacrifice anything, to someone more important than myself, and it was there happiest moment of my life. It still is. \n\nThe capacity for love I have today, it's only because she came into my life and kicked open a locked door inside of me with such force that it fucking shattered. Lack of templates be damned. \n\nShe gave me this gift. She never got to make this world her own, but she still affects it. She is in every act of kindness, a part of me forever. And I love her so much, and today, this week, I miss her so much.I want to tell her that I'm so grateful to her.  So, so grateful. \ud83d\ude2d", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I went downstairs to go see my dogs and I realized one was missing, so I went upstairs to go find her, as sometimes she\u2019ll manage to get herself on the couch up there. I was greeted by my two roommates at the top of the stairs telling me that I needed to sit down and they had to talk to me. Then came the news that my baby wasn\u2019t with us anymore. They left the door open after I had left for work and my blind pug wandered outside without any supervision, and she got hit... and she laid there. They didn\u2019t find her for at least 20 minutes they said, and it kills me that my baby, my everything I swore to protect, was laying there dying alone, scared. All while I wasn\u2019t home. I moved out of that house the day after. \n\nAlmost a month has gone by and I\u2019m still a wreck. She was my reason to live, she gave me a reason to get up in the morning. She was always there for me during the tough times to give me snuggles. She was always there to put a smile on my face. I lost that. I lost the biggest part of me. Its so hard for me to get out of bed, to do anything, to go out and socialize. I just can\u2019t bring myself to do any of it anymore. It\u2019s even hard to eat. \n\nI just feel so guilty that I lost my baby due to someone else\u2019s negligence. I keep going back to what preventative measures I could have taken, what I could have done differently to save her. Or just how different my life would be if I still had her. A part of me still expects to see her one day. I\u2019m expecting that I\u2019ll just be able to go pick her up from the vet and she\u2019ll be okay again, even though I\u2019ve already picked up her ashes. \n\nI talk to her every night. Before I got her ashes back I would hold her collar and talk to her, ask how shes doing, send my love, tell her about my day and the dogs, and how much I miss her. Now that I have her ashes back with me I snuggle them with her blanket wrapped around them, I sleep next to them, I bring them on walks with me and the boys. I\u2019m always scared people will judge me for that if I ever mentioned it to anyone, but it makes me feel just slightly better, being able to still include her in activities and still almost treat her as if she was still here. But she\u2019s not.\n\nMy heart is completely broken. My little pug took a huge part of me that day when she died. It\u2019s so hard for me to continue on without her. And every day that passes is another day further from the last day I was able to hold her paw, kiss her face, give her pets and belly rubs. It just gets harder everyday and it\u2019s hard for me to hold on. I just want to cuddle my little girl again.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Dealing with her illness, death and handling her affairs afterwards, pretty much with no help from my sister, was absolutely draining. It was the hardest, scariest, most stressful and emotional time of my life. Shortly before she passed away my grandmother (who is like a second mother to me) fell and broke her hip. She recovered, but has to stay in assisted living because of mobility issues.\n\nA month after my mom passed, my sister (only sibling) got very sick and had to have surgery and she and her children had to be cared for, for a few weeks. Another very scary and stressful time. A few months after getting through the first holidays without my mom and grandma, my aunt had a major stroke. Thankfully, she was treated in time and made a full recovery.\n\nDuring that time, I found a lump in my breast and was completely terrified and just shut down. I just stayed in bed for about 2 weeks and just cried. I'm so grateful that it turned out to be a benign cyst. I went in to have an exam and the doctor felt a large cyst on one of my ovaries, so he sent me sobbing and crying to get an ultrasound done. I had a tennis ball sized cyst on each ovary that had to be surgically removed. Great. My first surgery, after all of the back to back extremely stressful crap I had just gone through, and dealing with all of this without my mom here felt impossible. My surgery was in February and went fine. I started feeling really \"out of it\" and had bloodwork, an MRI and saw countless doctors and all of them came to the conclusion that stress and anxiety were causing me to feel the way I was. Going through that year and a half of taking care of my dying mother, her death, and then all of the major events that happened in a span of 4 months had taken its toll on me. I had a complete nervous breakdown. Constant anxiety and dissociation.\n\n Fast forward to early 2018 and I was still losing hair that doctors assured me was from stress. I saw a hair restoration specialist and he diagnosed me with a progressive alopecia. I spent that year in bed frought with anxiety and depression over that. Come to find out, my hormones had been out of whack for a year and my doctor never even told me. He assured me everything was fine when I called to check. It's destroying me. I lost my grandmother early this year, and my dog, my constant companion, died 2 weeks ago. Meds and therapy only help so much. I can't stand grieving my loved ones and now I'm grieving the loss of myself every single day. I can't heal. I literally spend every day in bed or on my couch anxious and crying. I try to leave my house sometimes and have tried to take up new hobbies, but it never leaves me. I feel so lost.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I lost my mom 5 months ago to a serious illness. She was sick and then became handicapped and then sicker on and off for the past decade of my life. I'm 36 years old, and my mom died at 70. I know she wasn't young (as one @ssh0le coworker pointed out when telling me she's \"sorry\"), but I feel robbed of having her for another 10 or 20 years. My grandma lived to be 93. My husband and I helped my dad take care of my mom for the past 5 or so years. It was rough. She was my best friend. I married the love of my life, but my mom was my soulmate. I don't know how else to put it. We talked every single day about everything.\n\nAnyway, that's the backstory. I'm doing okay. I mean, I'm not, but I'm functioning and exercising and hanging out with my husband and friends. I have good days and bad days. The thing is, I want to leave my job, and I'm wondering if I'm being rational.\n\nI have a long commute. 40-45 minutes in bumper-to-bumper traffic. I hate it. I used to call my mom on my way home and ask about her day and plan what we'd have for dinner. I used to tell her about my crappy passive aggressive coworkers and union drama and all of that. I can't do that anymore. I sit and look at my phone on my same desk, in that same place, and everything is the same except she's gone.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being impulsive, but I've wanted to leave my job for a while. I used to have more patience for all of the snarking and drama and BS where I work, and now I have none. I work with mostly women, and it's a catty atmosphere. \n\nLiterally 2 months before my mom died, I was promoted to a supervisor position. I took it because it meant a better title, but I barely make more money and I have 200% the responsibility. I've discovered that I HATE supervising and \"being in charge\" -- I miss my old position where I did IT work all day in a quiet office I shared with a quiet coworker. I'm pretty introverted. Now I have meetings all day, coworkers to direct, whispers behind doors (I'm \"the man\" and no longer in the union now, which is rife with conflict) and I just want to run away from it all.\n\nI applied for an IT job that is about 2 blocks from where I live (A DREAM) but it's significantly less money and a step down. I'm hoping for an interview, but I've also been sending out resumes to all sorts of jobs that are closer to where I live.\n\nIs it crazy that I want to change my job because I need a distraction from my grief? My job is such a source of stress and I want to be somewhere without coworkers saying they're sorry for talking about mother's day within my earshot. I want a job that conjures NO memories of my mom, one that's a different place. I have enough memories and grief when I'm not at work....\n\nI also feel very apathetic and like I don't care about my job or my performance or really the outcome of anything in my workplace. I still do a stellar job and I just got back a glowing performance review (although perhaps it was from pity due to the year I've had)... but still.\n\nI'm not sure why I even posted this.

Stubbornly she refused to go to the Dr. you know how parents are! But she'd always complained of pains all her life so this didn't seem any different but it was.\n\nYou see: Life. Life has been trying to take my mother from me, since I was little. It was one thing after another from cancerous abdominal tumors, throat cancer, skin cancer, 2 corneal transplants w/some complications, Diabetes and complications from BAND surgery later in life.\n\nMy mother has constantly fought, and suffered and won. But this time... she lost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer fatigue continued to get worse, when finally she came down with what we all believed to be was the cold/flu. We took her to the Dr, as she ran a low-grade fever.\n\nThis Dr proscribed her antibiotics, thinking it was just an infection, that was on a Friday. She did NOT improve, so on Monday I took her to the same Dr, he requested a chest Xray that Monday. Nothing came up it seems, and she continued to feel worse; my aunt finally came that Wednesday and took her again, this time he had blood work done.\n\nIt came back with abnormalities, they said and wanted her to the ER right away. So she and my aunt left. That was the last time my mom would ever be home.\n\nShe waited in the ER for over 12 hrs for a room,finally given one Thursday morning. They started taking tests, giving her blood transfusions saying, that the department that runs diagnostic doesn't work the weekends, we'd have to wait until Monday.\n\nThere we are, Friday just trying to get her to feel better, to eat, to drink and she did. It bothered me so much to see her like that. I practically pretended she was fine, she'd be home like every other time but I was secretly crying my eyes out expecting the worst, googling everything I could find on leukemia and other possible prognosis. Then I'd sleep and play some video games like I was in some fantasy world.\n\nEach day though, Friday, Saturday, Sunday she was improving, she was eating more, she was being herself. Saying inappropriate things, telling stories about family members.  My mom was my mom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday came the Dr said she had Leukemia, but her felt so confident he could treat her, that tomorrow (tuesday) they'd give her the type, send her to another hospital that's better at treating it. We were all so excited, so happy, my mom would come home again she'd win another battle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night/Tuesday morning she began to have more breathing issues, she'd maintained this low grade fever since being admitted Thursday, and she gave them permission to fully intubate her, because he lungs were hardening. The infection she had along with the leukemia was hardening her lungs, from that morning until noon they aggressively treated trying to 'reverse' things if possible but we were told this type of prognosis was very slim.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few hours later I'm holding her hand, in the ICU hooked up to every machine imaginable: Life support. It was over, every battle had finally ended and I stayed with her as they removed the tubes, I had failed her...at least thats how I feel. For not seeing her for two days because I was doing those things; I stayed to the end so maybe she could know, she could tell that I loved her more than life itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a few minutes my mother tried to breathe; her heart slowing, that death-rattle as she involuntarily gasped for air at this point then nothingness. In a few minutes the woman who had defined me and my life was gone. Sleeping eternally before my eyes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was mother and father both, the only parent I had despite having my father (who is mentally ill) who could never care for me, or himself. This woman I had tried to show my love to by giving her everything materialistic I could afford that she never had: new cars, houses, vacations, clothes, anything she wanted I'd try to get it for her. I hope that my mother knows I love her, that I did everything for her and now she's gone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sit here on my PC like I'm in a fantasy world to numb my pain, the internet my only escape as it has ever been. I feel like I'm letting her down by not weeping for hours into the day or night, that I am not 'behaving' like a grieving daughter should. I sat and looked at coffins, flowers, everything I want to make her funeral perfect in the way she wanted. Lilac and purple...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've spent my life being a f\\*ck up, even though I tried my best for that time, that moment, no matter how stupid my idea, how childish I was my Mommy was there, always.

He was someone who didn\u2019t think he deserved it when good things happened to him; who really didn\u2019t think much of himself, who didn\u2019t think he *made* much of himself. But that humility made him gentle and hard-working, and it made him continuously strive to be better and be good to his family.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Even if he didn\u2019t realize it, my daddy taught me a lot of things that I find really valuable in my life, and so I thought I\u2019d share some of them with you:   \n&gt;  \n&gt;1. Be kind to everyone, and always be thoughtful and considerate of those around you. We always joked about how, even through the worst of his sickness, after every shot, poke, prod, or yank, he would always give a light-hearted, \u201cok, thank you!\u201d I learned by watching him, that even when you\u2019re your worst self, you should always put out your best self, and you should always give thought to what you say to others, because people remember that about you.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;People remember you by how you made them feel. My dad knew someone everywhere we went. He could just pick up a conversation with a near stranger, because he recognized him from a Guitar Center in 2014. My dad had a lot of friends\u2014I think people gravitated towards him because he could find a common interest with anyone, and that made people feel an easy connection. It\u2019s funny because he normally came off as quiet and standoffish, but that usually never lasted\u2014 all you had to do was tell him you liked his hair, or his tattoos.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;2. Be kind and gentle towards animals. We made fun of my dad, and called him Father Nature or a Garden Gnome. Other peoples\u2019 pets flocked to him at parties, like they could sniff out his benevolence. Our own pets favored him over my mother and I, even though we coaxed them with table scraps and snacks. Didn\u2019t matter\u2014 they perched on his lap with pride as soon as he sat down. The animals that live outside our house were his, too. He made sure to keep the bird bath topped off with fresh water, he left dry cat food out in hidden spots for the stray cats, and he\u2019d shoo rabbits out of the street at 3 in the morning because he was afraid they\u2019d get hit by a car. My mom actually just reminded me recently of the time he said he learned that pigs cried when they felt pain, and so he decided he was not going to eat pork anymore.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3. Be thankful for everything you have in your life, even the things you wouldn\u2019t normally consider. The surgery to remove the tumor in January took a little more than half his tongue, and damaged a lot of muscles in his neck and throat, which caused him to have dysphagia, which is an inability to swallow. It was something we were going to begin rehabilitating after treatment, but for those months after surgery, he had a feeding tube, and that\u2019s how he got pretty much all of his food and nourishment. There\u2019s a picture I have of him, in particular, from February\u2014 in the photo he has his feeding tube and he\u2019s sitting at the kitchen table and he looks just elated. In that moment, he had just tasted some cream of mushroom soup for the first time in a couple months, and he told me \u201cThat was the most delicious soup I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d And I was like, \u201cCream of mushroom is disgusting but whatever.\u201d   \n&gt;  \n&gt;But ever since then, when I\u2019d run to catch an elevator I'd think to myself, *I\u2019m so glad I have these legs to run.* When I\u2019d hear really good song come on in the car I\u2019d think, *I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m sitting here in my car enjoying music and sunshine.* I think I\u2019ll always do that now, thanks to my dad.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;4. Find the thing that makes your heart sing and your personality shine, and keep it close to you for as long as you live. He, of course, liked comic books and horror movies and reading and bad British comedy, but we all knew music was his true love. I couldn\u2019t say all this about him and leave out his love of music. He could play any instrument you handed him, just give him a couple minutes to pluck around on it and he\u2019d figure a little something out. Play a song of any genre and he knew who recorded it, what album it came off of, and then he'd have a recommendation for another song you might like.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Music was his thing, his over-arching theme in his life. My parents surrounded me with music growing up, and I think it was because he wanted to submerse me in his most favorite thing, the thing that made him, him. We went to concerts, saw cover bands, waited around to get autographs; and when I got older he started taking me to concerts of bands I liked (while making fun of them), and taught me to have a CD booklet and sharpie on me at all times, ready at a moment\u2019s notice, just in case.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;There was a time when I was very young, I remember actually wondering if he was a Beatle. He would bring me on his usual record store rounds and I remember seeing the Let It Be album cover at some point, where they all had long hair and beards and mustaches and I remember looking closely at them and really had to think about, ok so *which one is him?* He really got into karaoke in the last few years, and would make me sing Beatles songs with him, so I could sing the Paul harmonies while he sang the John part. I was always like \u201cGod, Dad, you\u2019re so embarrassing,\u201d but he loved it so much. He was always our favorite Beatle. He played like George, acted like John, looked like Paul, and sang like Ringo. \ud83d\ude02  \n&gt;  \n&gt;5. Be sure to always recognize the people in your life, to pay attention to them, and express to them how they inspire you when you get the opportunity. For example, my mom is fierce, and I admire her ability to make things happen when you need her help. My fianc\u00e9 is full of such light and encouragement, he brightens the mood in every room he enters.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;I wish I would have taken the time to tell my dad how he inspired me. One day while I was driving him to treatment, he sat in the passenger seat of my car, and with tears in his eyes, said, \u201cIf there\u2019s anything you ever wondered or wanted to know about me, I want you to know, you can just ask me. I want you to feel like you know me.\u201d And I brushed it off and joked and said, \u201cTrust me, I know enough.\u201d But now I wish I would have given him more recognition when I had the chance, and I hope he knows that I did know him. I watched him so intently my whole life.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Tell your people you love them, every day.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;6. Lettuce does not belong on sandwiches.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

The only warning I got was last week when she told me that she wasnt sure she wanted to be in a relationship anymore and we talked about things we could do to improve things.  Normal adult stuff right?\n\nI got home 2 days later and found a mortgage packet in the mailbox and presented it to her, she told me most of the story.  She had been talking with her single friend and they decided that she would buy a condo and her friend would pay rent.   She went through the entire process of looking at places, negotiating contracts, due diligence and financing and they close next Thrusday.   She bent over backwards to hide all of this.   During this time she even told me how great our relationship was, that I was clearly climbing out of the grief from all the trauma (because I was very above board about EVERYTHING I was feeling, what i was doing about it and very deliberate about doing things TOGETHER to ensure that the relationship wasnt taken for granted.\n\nSo now she has started the process of moving out of the home/life we built and this hurts more that all of the other tragedies that have happened.

Meanwhile, I bought a house across the country, moved while 8months pregnant, and welcomed my first child into the world.\n\nYesterday marked the one year anniversary of my sister-in-law losing her battle with cancer. She was 37. I was across the country in Denver when I found out, and being very close to my brother I hopped on the next plane to go be with him in Baltimore. I stayed for a week. \n\nOne day into my stay, we get a phone call that our father has been rushed to the hospital for emergency open heart surgery. my brother fortunately lived very close to the hospital, so we met Pops on his way into the OR to say \u2018I love you and good luck\u2019. \n\nSurgery went well. My father had congestive heart failure and one of the leads to his pacemaker (internal) had developed a mass. They removed the mass and all of the leads and planned to replace the pacemaker once he was rehabilitated from such invasive surgery. \n\nA few days later, they had services for my sister-in-law. I went through the motions with my brother as he shopped for a suit, sorted through photos, and tried to figure out how to live a life without his best friend and one true love. He had been living with his wife at a home they rented from his MIL, and already she had started asking questions about his plans. It was horrible to watch helplessly as my big brother, went through such a living nightmare. \n\nI flew back to Denver a few days after the service and after my dad had been cleared. He was to stay in the cardiac unit a while and then move on to do rehab and eventually go home. \n\nOH YEAH, meanwhile I am also 6.5 months pregnant at this time! My husband stayed in Denver because we needed his income and couldn\u2019t afford the cost of double plane travel. ALSO, we were planning to move back to Baltimore so we were in the middle of buying a house, across the country, while juggling doctors appointments and picking up our belongings.\n\nLess than two weeks go by, and I receive a call from my brother\u2019s sister-in-law. There has been an accident and my brother has fallen 2.5 stories off of the roof of his home. He and a neighbor were moving furniture off of the roof when he slipped and fell. He fractured one leg in multiple places and had severe injuries to his face and head, but there was not internal bleeding and he was in the ICU. \n\nI couldn\u2019t afford to fly back out, and by now we had settled on a house with plans to move back in six weeks. I spent every day on the phone with doctors - my dad\u2019s, my brother\u2019s, and my own. I coordinated with close friends of my brother to let them know what happened and to arrange visits when possible. My dad was recovering, with some complications due to blood pressure and renal failure (common after heart surgery), but was slowly improving. He was delirious at first but after about a week that seemed to mostly clear. My brother was in a medically induced coma and intubated, and eventually underwent a number of surgeries on his leg and foot. \n\nFinally, we moved back to Baltimore. My husband drove our car across the country and I flew by myself - 8 months pregnant and carrying a cat! Lol!. But we made it. We got somewhat unpacked, and within a week I was able to visit both Dad and brother. \n\nIt was AWFUL to see my brother that way. He looked like a ghost of himself and had lost so much weight. Around this time they started to reduce his sedation drugs, so after a week or so he was regaining consciousness. At first he was completely delusional. He didn\u2019t always recognize people and did not remember who had visited. He was confused and it was heartbreaking to watch, and to wonder if we would ever get him back.\n\nMy dad was moved to a rehab center and was doing better, now fighting a bad infection in his arm from where the IV leads were. He was not eating and therefor not regaining strength. My brother was regaining memory slowly, and one day started to seem much more \u2018with it\u2019. We realized quickly that he had forgotten about his wife\u2019s passing. Being the closest to him, I arranged for a number of family members to be present, and I went in ahead with my mother to relay the awful news. Once I gently reminded him, he did remember the other details of her passing and even planning the services, and as painful as it was it appeared to be the trigger he needed to start progressing mentally. a few weeks later he too was moved to a rehab facility.\n\nNot a week later, my first child was born. I had a relatively event-free birth and everyone was healthy. \n\nThe same day I went home, my brother was sent home to stay with my sister. My father was not doing well, he was still not eating and he had an episode that rushed him back to the cardiac ICU. I spent the days learning how to care for a newborn and counting down until I could take him to meet his Poppy. Unfortunately that never happened. My father passed away about a month after my son was born, being in the ICU I couldn\u2019t bring an infant into the unit. My brother was actually recovering from his last surgery in the same hospital, a few floors up, the night we went to say goodbye to my dad. He was discharged that night and met us all in the ICU to say his final goodbye. My heart shattered as I kissed the man who raised me, who took such pride in his kids, who absolutely couldn\u2019t have loved any harder, for the last time. \n\nTwo weeks later was Christmas. Suffice it to say that we didn\u2019t do a whole lot of celebrating, but we faked it when needed for the kids. \n\nMy brother, having suffered a severe head injury, had some good moments and bad in subsequent months. He did not see his neurologist or therapist regularly and it occasionally seemed he was taking more than the prescribed amount of pain medication. \n\nLess than five months after my father died, my brother was found dead in his room at my sisters apartment. The toxicology and autopsy did not reveal much, and the cause of death death was ( two months later) ruled unknown. \n\nIt has been three months since this happened and I am still so heartbroken. Not a day goes by where I do not bawl my eyes out for all of this terrible loss. I\u2019m not really sure how life goes on from here, I know it does, but it certainly will never be the same.\n\nMy son is now nine months old and will never meet his poppy or his uncle or his aunt\u2026 But I have to find a way to have their memory live on so he can know who they were. \n\nI\u2019m open to suggestions.\n\nSincerely, \nBroken Mama", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

It is also accompanied by a heaviness in my chest and a weepy feeling. The best explanation for this that I can think of is it could be complicated grief. I have read about how repressed grief can (for lack of a better term) catch up to a person; forcing them to go through it whether one wants to or not. \n\nBackground: I have never been able to cry or grieve over the tragedies I have survived. I have repressed so much of it for more than a decade. My ex husband was very abusive and (please do not judge me) tried to murder me more than once. I also suffered severe sexual assault and exploitation. The last thing was that my sister and three of my nieces were killed by a drunk driver. All of these things happened within a span of three years. In order to survive I just shut down, and carried on.\n\nEvery single time I would come close to crying I would feel nauseated and either throw up or gag. It got so bad that I would feel nauseous when I felt sad or thought about the past. This went on for more than a decade.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started feeling emotional, heavy, and extremely irritated with everyone. Above all, I just craved being alone. I also started crying. I mean, crying so much that it feels endless. Like a bottomless well. I cry about everything and nothing. I just want to curl up in a blanket with some wine and never leave my house. \n\nTo be clear: I do not think it is clinical depression; I have been there, and this is not the same. I still actually get up and get my stuff done, though not perfectly. At least, though, I can say that it is not the crippling inability to keep up that comes with depression. \n\nTL;DR: after years of repression I might be suffering from complicated grief, but I need some advice from someone who knows what it looks like.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

She was 15 this year and in end-stage kidney failure. So there wasn't really much we could do. I'd had her since I was nine. We got her when she was five months old. She was a rescue. And a really really good pup.\n\nI'm in the process of moving. As in, I'm literally moving to a new city away from my small town on Sunday. My twin sister moved the week before. She actually drove back up to say goodbye to Daisy. She's a wreck. I mean, we all are, but she is a lot more sentimental about things and she was incredibly close to Daisy.\n\nA few months ago we had to put down my ESA Kanu. Kanu was the best cat you could ask for. He was always there for me during the time we thought my heart would stop any day. He would always be up for a cuddle. He purred like a motorboat. He was just so sweet and gentle and always by my side. \n\nWe had to put him down right before we left for my sister's college graduation. Like legit we had to put him down and then drive down to my sister's college. He'd been having problems breathing and we took him to the vet who said he was likely going to throw a clot and probably wouldn't survive the weekend. Kanu was an old cat. He was 17 years old. The vet said even if they found the exact problem, there wasn't much he could do. Kanu most likely wouldn't survive the testing, much less any treatment. His tongue was purplish. \n\nHim dying hurt me like Daisy hurt my sister dying. I'm a bulimic and I relapsed BAD after he died. I'm still in said relapse. He was such a help for me beforehand.\n\nLastly, my dad died in 2013. On July 4th. His death ripped my already shaky family apart. My mom, who had problems before, became very toxic and emotionally abusive. Our relationship is better now but we still have a lot of problems and while she isn't as openly toxic or abusive or anything, our relationship is very much strained and will never be the same. In general my family is bad with emotions. I'm kinda the emotional punching bag for everyone because I'm the resident fuck-up. But that's not the point.\n\nI just feel so disheartened. Everyone in my family seems to die at the worst times. And the blow of Kanu still hasn't gotten any softer and now Daisy is gone. And it's just hard. And it hurts. And I can't turn to my family for comfort because I know my mom is incapable of giving it to me and my sister is too hurt herself to be able to. And it sucks. It just sucks.\n\nHonestly, I feel worse about them then I did my dad. Which makes me feel bad, too. Because my dad was my dad. We didn't necessarily have the best relationship but he was my dad and he died suddenly. We didn't even get a week or a few days of 'oh they seem sick' like we did with my pets.

I've known her most of my life as she worked at my nursery and primary school and I only met my friend when we attended high school together. She had cancer about ten years ago which was apparently so serious the doctors didn't think she'd recover but she went into remission until about 2017, in which it came back and spread to the point they told her she wouldn't recover but could live another few years with treatment. She has been getting frailer and has been undergoing chemotherapy but overall she has still been getting out and about.\n\nObviously we all knew her illness was severe but I don't think anyone expected her to pass this soon. I haven't asked my friend about it because I know it's the last thing she'll want to talk about right now but we'd made plans to meet up tomorrow which she wouldn't have done if she'd suspected her mother was close to the end. \n\nMy friend's father died when she was very young (not sure what age, I never wanted to ask her about it) but she has three older siblings and several aunts/uncles. She lives in a flat of her own and is very self-sufficient therefore housing/finances won't be a worry for her. \n\nAlthough I've experienced a lot of loss in my life I'm fortunate enough to have both parents still alive and I can't even begin to imagine what she's going through.

If anybody has endured a similar situation I would love to hear some advice. \n\nThis is my first time posting here and just wanted to say I feel it's such an invaluable community.

I got fed up with security and told him that ultimately it is missing property and it\u2019s their job.  He then asks me \u2018well, was it anything valuable?\u2019\n\nThen I kinda lost it.  I told him I did not care if it\u2019s a toothbrush, it was my mother\u2019s personal effects and entrusted to their care and we want them back.\n\nI then called the administrator and filed a formal complaint.  Let\u2019s see where this goes, if things are still missing I\u2019ll file a police report.\n\nSo mad!\n\nEdit:  got a call from the hospital yesterday morning and they still have no idea.

Just the idea of working that position is so odd to me. How long before they got the job did they decide they wanted that position? I can't imagine kids growing up wanting to be a security guard, much less at a hospital.\n\nThere were two security guards there the night my brother died. Both were young, somewhere in their 20's, but older than him. They chatted to each other a bit but otherwise just stood or sat around. Used their phones. Nodded briefly at whoever walked in. For some reason, one moved just outside the room my brother was in while we waited for the news. He kept checking his Twitter. But when the doctor came to talk to us, he just had to cash in on that obscene curiosity and glance up at us while we registered the fact I'd just lost my only brother and my divorced parents' oldest son. I hadn't even seen my mom and dad together since his high school graduation.\n\nI wonder if that's why he took the job. To see people at their most vulnerable; to witness life-change on a regular basis. Lace up his boots, clock in, and sit five feet adjacent while I begin to experience the most profound loss of likely the rest of my life. I wonder if he has a sense of pride. Maybe he feels he's helping by working at an ER. Maybe he feels guilty. It's such a weird job, he does that every night. People dying with in 100 feet of him constantly, and he isn't even doing anything. Sitting in that stupid plastic chair. I wonder how many times he's heard the Code Blue. We heard it six times in those four hours, all for my brother. He even spoke to us on the way out. \"Sorry for your loss.\" He was the first to say it. And I wonder just how many times he says it in a week. How many people heard those words for the first time, from him? Has he had to hear those words? If not, he can't even begin to fathom the altercations concerned with the loss of the person whom you're closest with. We'd been making music together for years, movies and videos for longer. Not only was he my older brother, he was the only solid role model I had, my best friend, an amazing teacher, and an invaluable creative partner. This dude with the black jumpsuit and plastic badge will never even begin to touch on how much my brother meant to me and the effects of the situation which he commented on so routinely.\n\nIt's funny how everyone has the exact same things to say. I'm gonna hear people react to my brother's death for the rest of my life. Each time I make a new close friend, enter a relationship, run into an old acquaintance. \"I'm really sorry to hear about that. If you ever need anything...\" I guess there must be a template or something that I missed out on. It just feels so manufactured.\n\nAnd the doctor. He had to come talk to us three or four times before finally telling us my brother was dead. He was just getting us as close to ready as possible. The best part is he was totally clueless. He kept saying things like, \"It doesn't make sense. He's so young.\" Like we didn't know it already. And Los Angeles is supposed to have some of the best hospitals in the country. The closest one just happened to be the one with flickering lights, where homeless drug addicts go to ride off their final highs. If the ambulance had gone a few miles further, maybe down to Kaiser, would he still be here?\n\nAll these wonderings and still nothing is learned. I just really miss him. Everything is so weird.

The 4th death was difficult in a different way because it was an estranged family member that brought up different emotional issues. \n\nBut after each of these deaths, I felt what could be called very emotionally muted. Both happiness and sadness weren\u2019t really present even in daily life for about a year, then all of the sudden emotion hit me like a brick wall, my old eating disorder came back up, and I started having suicidal thoughts and I was basically extremely emotionally unstable for a couple of months. After some therapy for the eating disorder, I\u2019ve been relatively back to normal for like 6 months which is great.\n\nI am also the type of person when something very serious is happening (ie a person has a seizure in front of me) I have no real reaction to it, and can do things like very matter-of-factly call 911 or stabilize the person.

Thought I would share it here.", "author": "GummieLindsays", "self_text": "Grandma Marilyn had a huge influence in my life. She was always there for me at any given moment in time. In fact, she was there for all of us. Especially during the hardest parts. We were very blessed to have her in our life. I know she will be someone who will always be irreplaceable in my heart.\n\nGrandma Marilyn was a very funny woman, she had a great personality. One of my favorite jokes she'd always say to me growing up was, \"Balls, balls, said the Queen. If I had two, I'd be King\". I'll never forget that joke, and I will carry it with me and share it with anyone who needs a good laugh. Grandma Marilyn was one of a kind, I've never met anyone else like her. She was a very spunky, humorous, loving, sharing, and kind woman. Though, one of her best qualities she had was her mental strength. No matter what hardships she faced, she was able to conquer all of them. She was a walking miracle after her major brain hemorrhage around 20 years ago.\n\nI will always cherish the memories I shared with Grandma. From the earliest memories growing up as a little kid, to the ones from the last time I was able to see her. \n\nAs a little kid, I'll never forget her butterfly magnets she had on her fridge, and how I was fascinated with how pretty they were. I remember how, over time, she decided to give them to me because I loved them so much. And before she had her stroke, I'll never forget the beanie baby toys she had at her apartment for us grandchildren to play with anytime we went over there to spend the night. I'll never forget her cat named cricket, and I'll also never forget that large sea shell she always had sitting on the floor next to her chair. \n\nWhen I got older, I looked even more forward to staying the night at her place. We would always watch Animal Planet together, and when the Crocodile Hunter aired on TV, she would prop her legs up and watch it with me. We would also go to the local community building in her small senior apartment complex, and we would work on puzzles together all the time. Sometimes we would go on a walk to Braums, just around the corner, and get an ice cream together too. She would even save her juices that she'd get from Meals on Wheels, just so she could share them with me.\n\nI'll never forget her somewhat obsession with chickens and roosters either. And I'll never forget how she would do her shopping through Avon brochures, and brochures of other companies, picking us all something out to give to each of us every year. \n\nWhen I became an adult and moved away from Oklahoma, there was a time in my life that I didn't make enough from my job. I ended up being put on food stamps because I couldn't afford to buy food while living on my own. One of the biggest acts of kindness anyone has ever done for me, was my grandma would mail me $20 a month for about a year, just to help me out. She even told me to treat myself to a movie sometime, or go do something fun with a friend. To me, that money coming from her meant more than anything. She helped me out with what little she had, because she didn't want to see me struggle. She had the biggest heart anyone could ever imagine.\n\nShe always treated us to the small meaningful things in life. Even though she didn't have a whole lot in life, she lived her life like she did. And with what little bit she had, she always made a way to share with us or help us out. I know she really loved us deeply from the bottom of her heart. \n\nI wish she was still around with us right now, but in good health, because I wish I could ask her for advice on how to get through the really hard times in life. But at the same time I'm glad she has moved onto the next life without the pain of suffering that she endured for many years. I really loved her a lot, and I miss her so much. I wish I had been able to be there for her when she needed us the most.\n\nThank you Grandma for being an important influence in my life. I love you and I miss you dearly.

I told him how much I missed him checking on me before bed every night, how much I wished he could just tuck me in and tell me goodnight one more time.  at this point in writing the letter, the song I was listening to ended and I reached over to shuffle a different playlist.\n\nthe song that came on was by sleeping at last, the band that more or less soundtracked the eight months my dad was in the hospital before he passed.  I took that alone as a sign, but then I saw what the song was called.  the title was \"october 30, 2018: goodnight\"\n\noctober 30 was the day my dad passed away.\n\nhe literally told me goodnight.\n\nI respect anyone who doesn't believe in signs from deceased loved ones.  I've been one of those people on and off for all four years since he's been gone.  but at that moment I was overcome with closeness to his spirit.  I felt so peaceful and started crying.  I finished my letter and slept more peacefully and soundly than I have in a long time.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I\u2019m waiting for the sun to come up because I need to tell his wife, Nancy, .. Tell Meaghan, Sean, SOMEONE, that the time between each breath has doubled since I first sat down. Every time I hear his labored inhale I exhale my own breath because each time I\u2019m just so sure that it might not happen it again. \n\nNancy is in the doorway, she and Meg are up, it\u2019s only 5:45a or so. I tell Nancy about Dad\u2019s breathing and she listens for a minute or two and then she\u2019s in the kitchen calling my Aunt Sheila. Aunt Sheila is on the way and before I know it she\u2019s coming in through the garage door. We need to call the hospice nurse, she says, and we do. I remember a week prior when my dad told the home hospice intake person that his prognosis didn\u2019t really matter, yet. Nancy had to pull the lady aside to tell her what the prognosis was before she left; \u201ca few weeks, to a few months.\u201d \n\nHospice is there within the hour, I think Sean is still sleeping, he was up with Dad, counting breaths, until maybe 4a. The lady from hospice says \u201cit\u2019s going to happen today, call whoever needs to say goodbye.\u201d\n\nI remember Aunt Sheila looking at me and saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to call Mom.\u201d\n\nGrandma Susie shows up, she always looks well, maybe that\u2019s generational. She wasn\u2019t well, though. There was a navy chair in the corner of the room, facing my dad. She sat there most of the day, expressionless.\n\nPeople were coming by once word travelled. The pastor that married Dad and Nancy was in the kitchen most of the day, I think. He brought food. I remember my Uncle Mark showing up. I remember my Aunt Cathy coming in and I remember her ex-husband (and one of my dad\u2019s best-friends), Barry coming in. All of the goodbyes were heartbreaking. There were a couple of guys from his work, they were brief. \n\nMeaghan, Sean and I are on our knees beside his hospital bed in the middle of the living room. The floor was hard on my knees and it hurt. Meaghan spoke, where Sean and I couldn\u2019t seem to muster up a peep. \u201cYou\u2019re the best Daddy we ever could have asked for. You gave us such a good life. We love you so much. You gave us the BEST life.\u201d She repeated those words like a mantra all day long. \n\nHe opened his eyes and he looked at us, his three children, looking up at him from the side of his bed, I could see the pain in his eyes. Not from the cancer. It was because he realized he was dying and he wasn\u2019t ready. He closed his eyes and a few single tears trickled down his cheeks and then he was gone again. This happened every hour or so, almost all day. \n\nMore people are in saying their goodbyes. You can feel the heaviness in the room. \n\nIt\u2019s early evening and suddenly Dad is awake, he asks if we can turn the Cardinals game on. It\u2019s the first words he\u2019s spoken all day. We\u2019re confused but we do it, and for the first time all day people start chatting, eating, laughing even. I watch my dad from the corner of the room and he\u2019s not watching the game, he\u2019s watching us. His family. He seems so so sad. The game isn\u2019t on for very long, I don\u2019t think. He\u2019s tired and wants to lay down again and so we turn the TV off.\n\nIt\u2019s time. \n\n\n\nHis breathing is labored.\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re standing around him. I\u2019m at his bed, Meaghan and Sean are, too. Nancy. Aunt Sheila. I think my grandmother must be.\nHe squeezes my hand.\n\u201cWhat is it, Dad?\u201d\n\u201cSit me up.\u201d He says\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cSIT ME UP.\u201d And he\u2019s pulling on my hand, so we do sit him up. We\u2019re holding him and his weight is heavy. He can\u2019t breathe. \nOh god, it\u2019s happening. I don\u2019t know how to describe the sound of it but I THINK that I know his lungs are filling up with fluid. He can\u2019t breathe.\n\nHE CAN\u2019T BREATHE. \nThen, he doesn\u2019t breathe. \n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s it. It\u2019s over. We hold him sitting up for a while and we cry. We\u2019re going through this together and we\u2019re also going through it apart.\n\nI\u2019m the first person to walk away, I run to his master bathroom and I throw up. It\u2019s all stomach acid and vile. \n\nI go outside and I call Samm, I tell her \u201cit\u2019s happened\u201d and she\u2019s there within minutes. We sit outside, up against the side of her car in the driveway and wait for the coroner. I smoke a cigarette and wonder what kind of monster smokes immediately after cancer kills their dad.\n\nAll the sudden our neighbor, Chery, is coming across the yard. Meaghan and Sean are outside too and Chery is crying, she\u2019s on the phone with our mom and to it she says \u201cI\u2019ve got them, Beck, I\u2019ve got them.\u201d And she grabs all three of us up in a bear hug and we all cry. \n\nAbby comes outside, too.

Nancy\u2019s dad, tells me that drinking beer is not what we need right now and in my mind I tell him to fuck off but I also nod my head at him and when he goes inside, I cry. Am I doing this wrong?\n\nI never go back into the house while my Dad\u2019s body is in there. The coroner finally shows up and I cry and Samm holds me.

For whatever reason my mother is doing perfectly well, thank you, and I feel like she's trying to expedite some things. She wanted to clean out his closet a few weeks ago but I asked that she hold off until after the funeral because to me it's wrong to get rid of things like that before you even say goodbye. She agreed.\n\nLast week she was supposed to do it I think on Tuesday or Wednesday. The funeral was Sunday and inurnment Monday. She didn't get around to it. I left town Thursday and got back Sunday afternoon. I told her this and she sent me a text Saturday saying she was cleaning out his closet Sunday. I then told her I expected to be back around noon. At noon she told me she was going out for lunch and I said I was running late and wouldn't be home until 4.\n\nI ended up not going over there at 4 because I'd just gotten home and was tired. But she cleaned it up anyway. She called me when she was done asking if I wanted anything (I'd mentioned I wanted a particular sweater) and I said yes, but please wait. I guess my brother was ready to take it all to Goodwill right then. We got in a fight. She basically didn't want to hold onto it any longer. Said it was \"clutter\" in her entryway. Then when I asked why she didn't keep it in his bedroom (she didn't share with him) she said she didn't want it there either. Cue irrational fighting as my mother doesn't know how to deal with stress and I'm pretty sure my brother pressured her into dumping it that night so she wouldn't have to as he would do it for her. But she agreed to hold onto it so long as I picked it up that night to donate myself later. I could hear my brother in the background with his tone of \"this is bullshit, stop wasting my time.\"\n\nI couldn't do it. I cried and cried. I didn't want to see his empty closet. Mostly I didn't want to accept donating his clothes because only living people need clothes and to donate them means he's not alive. He's not coming home. He'll never need his clothes again.\n\nWhen I was still living with him I gave him guff all the time about his outfit choices. He basically wore the same things: solid color polo shirts, usually red, blue, and yellow. They were paired with jeans mostly but he also wore shorts. I gave him a hard time because his shirts were faded in color or his outfits wouldn't match. He would always sigh if we were going out and I expressed dislike for his clothing choices.\n\nI cried about never seeing him in those outfits again. Never being able to ask him what he thinks he's wearing. He had multiple shirts of the same color and I don't know how to decide which to keep. It seems like he always wore red but *which* red shirt when he had 5? I cried for what seemed like at least 30m. My heart breaks for these memories and never being able to do it again. I want my dad back. I don't want his death to be real.\n\nI can't do it. I had to go to my mom's because she was cat sitting and didn't want the cat anymore. I had to look for the cat. She was particularly fond of my dad's bed so I had to go in there to see his empty closet and all those trash bags full of his clothes sitting on his bed. It didn't hurt as much as I thought. I got it all out at home before I went over there.\n\nI told my mom I can't do it. I asked if she could have the clothes a few more days. I said I can't accept that he's not coming home. Without my brother around I don't think she felt as much stress. She said yes. But she tried to argue that *she's* the one giving his clothes away, not me. I feel differently if I have to put them in my car and donate them myself, not her. I think she's distancing herself. The flowers she's been getting smell nice but why do we only have flowers when people die?\n\nThat was long. Thank you for reading. Big steps like this solidify the reality of the situation and it hurts so much. I know his clothes will go away eventually but god I feel like every time someone dies we rush things. My mother lives alone now and I don't see reason to push everything of his out already. But also I don't want to accept his death as permanent. I want him back.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Mentally, emotionally, physically I need him more than I ever have. It\u2019s fucked up everything for me, it\u2019s like the grief prolongs itself, I\u2019m just so confused all the time, so lost, and someone just told me that it\u2019s not so bad because it happened such a long time ago? But, it is, this shit doesn\u2019t go away. In fact, I think it\u2019s worse now than when it happened. How do I describe this to someone? How do I describe why I\u2019m so depressed? All of my mental health issues have stemmed from this problem. How do people support me through this? How do I cope with this?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I haven\u2019t seen grief like this since I was a child and it really shook me. I felt  completely helpless, all I could do was hug him when he would let me and rub his back.

We roughly been dating for 3yrs and 2 months she was from the Philippines I\u2019ve finally settled my finical problems out to where I could go see her next month for a week. That\u2019s the short of it. I bought tickets already to China to connect to the Philippines. I\u2019m unsure what to do I\u2019ve been crying all weekend she passed on the 3rd of August. I\u2019ve spoken to her family and friends she  passed in an area where she she did not want me to go near due to high rate of kidnapping and. Murder of foreign people by rebel fighters. She left behind a 2 yr old son which I\u2019ve come to adore as he were my own child and I want to go visit him but I\u2019d want to go see her burial site as well. My family says it\u2019s not a good idea to travel there due to the state of that part of the country.  I can understand that and her family has implied the same when I asked. I called the airline to see if they could change the date to this month to see what the cost would be and it\u2019s insanely expensive. So I\u2019ve come to terms I won\u2019t be able to go this month anyway. But I think it\u2019s just me wanting to be there for her son more then anything else. I\u2019m not sure what to do. \n\n\nFull story- so 4 yrs ago I was on a dating site and met her we hit it. Off became good friends she was still in college we\u2019d Skype chat on fb daily she introduced me to her friends and dorm mates. We talked daily spend hours speaking she was very bright and smart and out going aswell  couldn\u2019t tell you a negative thing about her if I tried well okay her self confidence was lacking but I would always encourage her to do her best. So come 6months of chatting she suddenly stopped speaking to me. I\u2019d message her and ask her if everything was okay and all that stuff. Come 2 weeks later she told me she was pregnant from her ex and that she was going to marry him but she didn\u2019t love him. So obviously I was pissed and I pointed out that if she didn\u2019t love him not to marry him. She came to find out that his condition to marry was to abort the child. And she wasn\u2019t going to let that happen so she decided to cut ties with him after that . We kept speaking and she was depressed obviously worried about dealing with the pregnancy alone and finishing her classes before the baby was due . So I told her that I was in love with her and I\u2019d support anything she decided to do and the smiles she had on her face was one I\u2019d never forget fast forward 8 months later she brought her brother from Provence to Manila to get his life started in the city and help her out while she was pregnant. Month later she was giving birth to a beautiful baby boy. Through out her first 6-9 months she stayed in Manila running a shop out of her apartment building to cover for her expenses. She felt overwhelmed and wanted to go back to her Provence to have a break so i encouraged to do so she\u2019d have her brothers and mother to help while she decided what to do. So what I expected to be a month trip ended up turning into two years of living there she didn\u2019t like it but really didn\u2019t have a choice she wasn\u2019t able to find work so she ran the family store for the first year come last month she finally got a job at the mall a few towns over from home she got up at 4am to get ready and commute to work and she would get out at 5-7 o\u2019clock and commute 1-2 hrs home . So she just started the job I told her I was able to get a week off to go see her and she was so excited then she recalled someone telling her that they don\u2019t allow days off unless you been there for a year already . So I told her just ask and find out it was 12pm there and 12am where I live and I went to bed so I wake up getting ready for work and I read her messages from earlier that morning while I was asleep and she had basically explained her whole life story to everyone in the locker room while speaking to her boss she was crying because everybody knew all her life story between me and her and her son and his father not wanting him and they gave her 5 days off approval. So I replied with I\u2019m sorry that happened but I\u2019m glad we can finally see each other. It was 9am here and she is usually tired from getting up so early and playing with her son so I figured she was asleep and went about my day. Come 9 pm my time I get a text from her best friend asking me if this was the guy dating cj I reply yeah who\u2019s this I\u2019m so and so  and I recall speaking to her back when she was in school and she tells me that cj died last night I immediately saw her brother online and confirmed it I dropped my phone I was with my family at the time my mother saw the message and I started crying my eyes out. \n\n\nSo yeah now I\u2019m trying to figure out what i should do I want to go see her son but the state of the area isn\u2019t a place where a foreigner should go I\u2019m trying to see if the family will be willing to travel so I can meet them in a safe area for me to meet her son. I\u2019ve gotten the I shouldn\u2019t go from many and a few saying I should but obviously is a safe place. I\u2019ve got 35 days till my ticket expires to either continue on my initial trip or change it with out losing money.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Just a month ago, the number of people I had lost was three. Our dear family friend, Brian, my great grandmother and my grandfather. Just a month later, I have lost two more, my great aunt and my great uncle. My family is old, and things like this were bound to happen to the oldest of us, but with Brian being 65, and my grandfather only a few years shy of 70, they all came as a tremendous shock and still have left a hole in. my heart.\n\nFunerals are meant to be when you let go, but I've found that to not be the case. After 4, and the fifth for my great uncle Ken coming up, funerals, I have found the grief doesn't dissipate with heartfelt eulogies and goodbyes with their favourite music, it continues long after that. I have been in a constant state of grief for nearly 2 years, all of it building and building as more of my family join those we have already lost on the other side, and there has been little to no relief. I can't look at photographs, I can't listen to the music they listened to, and the sound of a phone ringing reduces me to a sobbing mess, because it rouses all the memories of finding out the news, the terrible, dreadful news.\n\nI fear this is all going to catch up to me, as I cope mainly by shutting down. I hold my feelings close to me, I have withdrawn from making new social connections, and I have essentially severed all emotional holds. I think I just need support now, and someone who understands to help me open up, but I can't help the overwhelming fear and panic of even more people being lost.\n\ndeath has made me feel powerless.\n\nTLDR; grief fucking sucks and ive had enough of it", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I don\u2019t care, except that\u2019s really unlike me, which makes me worry that if i don\u2019t get out of this funk quick enough all my relationships will suffer due to my attitude right now.

I don\u2019t want to rely on people for support, mostly bc it\u2019s not enough.

I never made it to his funeral and i think someone needs to read this and hear about him. Im not a writer by any means but ill do my best to portray a man who always had my back.\n\nTheo was raised by his mother in a small town, I don\u2019t know much about him from this time but from what I can tell from the stories i got from his family he was a quiet child, gifted with a brain that drew the attention of many of his teachers. Preferring isolation and books to the company of others. I remember talking with him, once and asking about the first time he was in a fight, most of the time he would say his first fight was at 15 over the fact some guy mocked the way he spoke. Though after a few drinks you could sometimes pull the truth out of him. I got the story of an eight year old kid trying desperately trying to choke out the 20 year old man who had beaten his sister unconscious in the living room of a small flat while his mother called the police. I think this is the single best way to sum up the man I grew to know. At any moment  willing to step inbetween someone he cared for and a beating or worse.\n\nTheo was always a contrast of a person he was loud boisterous never knew when to turn it down. He could be a massive arsehole and a braggart, he could hold a grudge like noone i have ever met. He was also unflinchingly loyal and compassionate to those he i believe loved. Would never talk badly about those he cared for even when being wronged by them. \n\nHe had his quiet moments too. More often then not when these moments occured i think sadness is what fueled them. I dont feel like he had much happiness in his life. while he was here i dont think many people took to time to realise this.\nOften on nights out find him the 6 foot 2 fridge of a human in the corner with some small drunk girl crying her eyes out alone as she spilled her guts about all that was wrong. Offering what advice he could. If you ever brought it up he would say he was trying to get his dick wet. Never saw him ever try.\n\nI think through one way or another he had this fundimental kindness that the world taught him was a weakness. The world never beat it out of him despite his efforts to convince people it had. Even after so much piled on top of him. Never wimpered never complained. He was a human with limitless measures of unconditional love. \n\nI ask people to take the time with people like this. Someone who on the surface may seem rough crude and dickish. And if you do have someone like this on your life ask what is wrong. I think it might of made the difference if he thought someone cared.\n\nTo the kindest person i ever met.\nTheodore.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

The reality is this is a perfectly normal experience and it\u2019s okay to talk about it. \n\nMy aunt was murdered 1.5 years ago and it\u2019s been a horrific experience for my family and myself. I\u2019ve turned my refrigerator into a \u201cwall of love\u201d where I pin up pictures or cards from people who love me the most. This way every time I come into my kitchen I can experience some happiness. I have love notes and photos from my boyfriend, housewarming cards and thank you cards from cousins and friends, and photos of my sibling and nephew and niece. I also have two copies of my aunts memorial card from the funeral, one facing forward with her dates of birth and death and a poem we wrote for her, and one showing the back which is a photo of her walking on the beach. \n\nI have them held together by a yellow magnet, which was her favorite color. Underneath that I have a housewarming card from her daughter. My aunt used to send me cards for every occasion on her and her children\u2019s behalf, so the fact that her daughter makes sure to send me cards for every occasion makes me feel like the tradition didn\u2019t die. \n\nLast night my boyfriend went to go swat a fly that was flying around my kitchen, and he swatted the fridge. All of my cards, photos, and magnets came flying off the fridge. I started yelling at my boyfriend telling him to be more careful with my belongings, especially those on the refrigerator. As I went to pick up all the magnets and cards scattered on the ground, I found that I literally couldn\u2019t pick them up. I started shaking. I realized in that moment that i couldn\u2019t remember how I had configured the photos and cards, and I couldn\u2019t find my yellow magnet for my aunt\u2019s funeral cards. \n\nThat\u2019s when I burst into tears on my kitchen floor. I was in a complete frenzy because I wanted to pick up the pieces but I couldn\u2019t. I was angry. I was sad. I just remember screaming \u201call I have left of her are these stupid fucking pictures.\u201d and \u201cshe\u2019s never coming back.\u201d I eventually found the yellow magnet under my kitchen table and was able to put everything back the way I had it. I cried on the couch for the next hour. \n\nIt\u2019s crazy how the little things send you back to the day you first heard the news. These bursts of grief can come days, months, and even years later after you think you\u2019ve mostly gotten over what has happened. Hopefully some of you can relate to this and find some comfort in the fact that you\u2019re not alone. It\u2019s okay to be randomly sad sometimes.

I don\u2019t believe in an afterlife, and I don\u2019t believe I will ever see him again.\n\nHe died when I was 14, a month after I found out. He was my favorite parent, he was my rock, he was my best friend, the person who supported me most in this world, and I loved him more than anyone. \n\nIt was traumatic, and some events following. I was in shock for a long time, and never got to truly grieve. He died on a Thursday, and I went back to school that Monday, and carried on with life. Grief never hit me hard, I never broke down and lost it for weeks. I never sat and cried for a day because he was gone. Even still, I break down for an hour and even if I\u2019m thinking of him, I\u2019m fairly composed. \n\nMy head feels broken. I\u2019m 18 now, and ever since he\u2019s died, due to my lack of religion, I knew I wouldn\u2019t ever see him again. It is simple for me to say and think that thought, that he\u2019s gone forever. But I have dreams, so vivid, and real, where he returns, he apologizes he has been gone so long, but tells me he is back now. He acknowledges he got sick, but he tells me he is better now. I\u2019m always angry and upset he left, but it\u2019s the best feeling in this entire world that he\u2019s back again.\n\nA part of me believes that he will come back. I have hope somewhere, that he will return, he will walk through the front door and speak to me like in my dreams. If it happened, I wouldn\u2019t be shocked I feel like, although I know it\u2019s impossible. He is dead, I watched them take away his body, I saw his ashes. I was at the funeral, I was at the wake. I watched him die. \n\nI stand at work, and sometimes I look at the door and wish he would walk in. I see men that have some resemblance to him, and wish that they could just become him and come hug me. Sometimes someone sounds like him, in an isle over, and my heart skips a beat...is he here? But then I realize that he\u2019s dead. But I look anyways. \n\nSometimes, like right now, I believe in my heart he will return. The fact that he can\u2019t is only a minor doubt to me. I hate this feeling and it makes me feel like I\u2019m losing my mind. I don\u2019t know how to combat this. I hate this. I don\u2019t think I will ever not feel this.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

She left him really early in my life, I dont even remember him but vaguely in my childhood. When I turned 14-15 I moved in with him until I met my husband and moved out when I was 16. Dad and I were close the short while I lived there, but his fiance and I weren't really at all, she was used to having his full attention so I felt like I was in the way of that. \nI moved in with my boyfriend, now husband, and dad and I drifted apart. I never made an effort to see him because he didnt really make an effort to see me. We had our son 2 years ago and I felt like I was finally ready for him to meet him when he was about 6 months old, it was around christmas. We had made a plan to meet up, but I got cold feet and backed out because I wasnt sure how I felt with my baby, something that means the most to me in the world, meeting someone who had let me down so often in my life. And now I'm pregnant again and the when I told him he responded maybe you'll let me meet this one. And that was really the last time we spoke. \nAbout 3 weeks ago I get a text that hes in ICU with stage 4 lung cancer. I went to see him a few times but couldn't bring my son because of the ICU rules. Yesterday was my sons 2nd birthday, my dad passed away on his birthday. I was called the morning of and they told me to bring the baby with me, that this was the end. I didnt believe it, like surely he would be okay. He was so alert and seemed happy when I went the last time a week ago. I went, and he was already in a vegetative state. Nothing else that could do. My son got to meet him, touch his hand, but it was too late to work on our relationship. Or for him to get to know my son. I feel like I've robbed my son of a grandparent. I feel like all feelings I held onto caused this, like maybe if we were in his life he would have fought harder. \nI just cant believe hes gone. I always thought there would be a chance to fix whatever we had between us. I just have to get this off my chest. My husband doesnt fully understand, even though hes as supportive as he can be. And I can't really talk about this with anyone else, because of my mom and dads history.\n It just breaks my heart that he'll never meet him only grandchildren, and that they'll never know how much he changed and what a good person he was trying to be.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

We didn\u2019t have a massive family but he treated all 4 of his children with a full heart (me being the youngest) and protected us from the hard days that my abusive Mother created. He was the kind of father that even though he knew I would be ok driving home after visiting him with my kids, they were precious cargo to him so he would follow me home in his car and sit waiting till I had got into the house then he would drive home. He was a gentleman, generous, hard working and extremely talented. And if someone asked me to describe the perfect Father it would hands down always be him! \nThe week before my 27th birthday he asked me what I would like as a gift and because I liked to challenge him because I loved his ability to succeed I asked for a heart shaped mirror. And sure enough on my Birthday that\u2019s exactly what I got!!! The most beautiful heart shaped mirror I have ever seen... Little did I know that would be my last birthday with him in my life. He took ill shortly after, mostly because of the huge amount of stress my Mother caused him. He was back and forth to the drs with chest pains and his diabetes became out of control. He came to visit me one evening out of the blue and was very different. He looked drained and was sad. He cried and pretty much begged me to move in to my house because my Mum had become unbearable and he no longer could cope. I told him that I didn\u2019t have a room for him or a bed but we would try and sort something out so we can get him out of there. I felt useless because of all the years he had been there for me I couldn\u2019t even put him up in my house that night. He drove home and that was the last time I saw him alive. The next morning he had a heart attack and was rushed in to hospital. Two of my siblings came to my house very upset and told me that it was touch and go so they needed to get me to the hospital quickly, but it was too late, he had just died literally 5 mins before I got there and to top it off he was with my Mother at the time he passed. The person who caused him the most anguish in his life. She was emotionless and I never saw her cry once. \nThe worst possible thing I could have done was to see him in the funeral home, He looked empty and pained and I regret doing that because when he had just died he looked peaceful. I wish I could get the horrible funeral home image out of my head! Anyway all these years later not one of my family talk to each other anymore as we all one by one pushed each other away for one reason or another. Mostly because we didn\u2019t know how to live without him. And I still grieve him terribly, knowing if he had stayed that night he might have been still here now! \nThank you for listening, I just needed to get that off my chest \ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude22", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Both her and my mom were ill, and met in the context of healing from the illness. Eventually mom died. Many things happened in between, but I tried to stay in touch with my mom\u2019s friend because of the bond created by our shared history through my mom. I managed to stay in touch with her a couple of times a year on average since mom passed away, and also visited her a few times. The last time I spoke to her was in Christmas. I called her. She said that she was not doing very well. However she was a strong, reassuring person by nature, and I guess I underestimated how bad she was actually doing. I followed up a couple of months later, with an sms. This happened three days before her death. Over the phone she was reassuring, again. She said she was doing better. Today, six months after the funeral, I learned that she died three days after that last sms. Nobody in my family seems to be particularly shocked. The shared memories are jamming in my head and I don\u2019t know what to make of them. I don\u2019t understand why nobody informed me, or invited me to the funeral. I learned about her death from the newspaper. Perhaps she was more of a friend to me, than I was to her. But I still feel a strong spiritual tie to this person. I would like to talk about her to people, and I cannot, because everyone seems to have other priorities. I would like to greet her goodbye. I know I cannot do any of the above, and my questions will probably stay unanswered. I just wonder if you have any word for me, any comment, or any \u201csomething\u201d to say to help me unlock this feelings of exclusion, lack of closure, and irreparability. I wish I had called her, instead of just writing her the sms... among other things that I wish. But now it\u2019s too late.

The night he did, I went over to my uncle's house for support along with my sister and my uncle's sister..What I didn't know until i got there, was that his body was still there. My sister wanted to say goodbye and trying to be the supportive big sister, I decided I would go with her. \n\nThese next few parts may be triggering to people as I go into detail about the manner of death. Which is important for my current issues. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n&gt;!!&lt;\n \nHe ended his life by placing trash bags around his head and securing them tightly. We believe he may have also used some medicine or alcohol to make him drowsy but we are still awaiting toxicology results. By the time we got there the bags were removed from his body but layed beside him. Initially seeing him helped calm my mind. I had created a much more gruesome picture in my head and truly he looked very peaceful like he was just taking a nap on his bed. We also found his cellphone, he made a playlist on YouTube titled \"the end\" and it was the last thing he listened to. The playlist contained only songs from Weezer, which happened to be one of my favorite bands. \n\nI was sitting downstairs in their living room when the staff from the funeral home came to collect him. The thing that broke me, was hearing them zip up his body. I guess at that point it became real to me. Seeing him at his viewing also ruined me. He looked nothing like himself. He was caked with so much makeup but I could still see the bruising. \n\nSince then, I cant sleep a full 8 hours. I think the most I've gotten in one night straight was 4 hours. I wake up continuously, often laying awake until my alarm goes off for work. When I do sleep, I'm often having nightmares.  I dreamed last night my son was dead. The night before that my cousin died all over again. \n\nDuring the day and at work, I'm exhausted, snippy, overeating or not eating at all. I have crying spells daily, the simplest things remind me of everything. I cant take out the trash anymore. It upsets me too much. I cant listen to Weezer anymore. I went to their concert last summer with my husband which happened to be his first concert. That is no longer a happy memory for me. I often get flashbacks seeing his body.\n\nI explained this to my sister and she suggested it may be beyond grief, it may be PTSD.

They had just celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary this year.\n\nEver the active, involved couple they were, they attended a political rally a couple of hours west of our home last weekend. They were slated to come home a week ago yesterday, they texted my dad that they would be home soon. They never came back. \n\nThere was a semi-truck accident on the highway and my grandparents, like the other cars, were stopped while they were clearing the accident off the road. A truck came barreling over the hill and wasn't paying attention to the road in front of them. They didn't see the stopped cars and rear-ended my grandparents at highway speeds. They said it was too late to stop.\n\nSince it was a rear accident, my grandparents' airbags didn't deploy. They hit the car in front of them. The truck and the car in front came out unscathed. My grandparents were airlifted to the hospital, in critical condition.\n\nMy grandparents were broken beyond repair. My grandfather had a stroke during the accident, my grandmother caught pneumonia. These were in addition to their collapsed lungs, broken bones, and ruined spines. Their ventilators were removed this morning. My grandmother died this afternoon, my grandfather is moving into hospice tomorrow. He can't talk, I don't even know if he can understand us. He's been fighting the machines and, even though they gave him a full dose of morphine, he's still struggling like hell because that's the stubborn Southerner he is. I think he'll go soon, especially since my grandmother is gone now. They were 2 peas in a pod-one without the other was so rare, and I know they wouldn't want to be apart like this for long. \n\nThis was so sudden, so heartbreaking, and so avoidable for our family. I feel nothing but sorrow for my beloved grandparents. They had so much more life left in them, they were so youthful. My grandfather was always doing yardwork for his neighbors and my parents, my grandmother spent her time volunteering at the hospital or participating in the Republican Party in her county. It could have all been avoided, if this man was paying attention to the highway and not whatever he was doing (the distraction is unspecified, as this is an ongoing police investigation). \n\nMy point is, I know the grief will begin to dissipate once my grandparents have been buried. Knowing myself, I will feel a great amount of rage towards the man who killed my grandparents.

He loved reddit, which is why I even made an account here in the first place. \n\nHe drove a motorcycle which he loved so much.

I did not pay it any mind, because my guy would never be involved. My friend called me at about 2:52 and asked if I had spoken to him.

I cant tell if I feel it's only been 2 months? Or it's already been 2 months! The rollercoaster ride of grief has been a lot to handle, but I feel like I'm starting to do a little bit better. For example, I think I've accepted that yes, he is gone and I'm never going to see him or hear his voice again. That's tough to think/write but at the same time, I just.....understand. I still talk to him. I say things out loud \"to him\" like \"I miss you so much\" all the time. I kind of feel like a crazy person when I do that but it brings me comfort. Does anyone else here talk out loud to the one they've lost?\n\nMy birthday is tomorrow. I'll be 32. And all alone. I've never been one for celebrating my birthday but, I was always content to spend the day or at least part of it just lounging around with my boyfriend, eating whatever I wanted and watching a movie together. I'm grateful that I have to work this year so I won't be home all alone. I have friends but like I said, I have never been one to celebrate. I also have mixed feelings about the fact that I'm turning 32 and just 2 months ago my life completely got turned upside down. I thought I had a plan for the future (with my boyfriend...typical stuff like buying a house, etc), but now I feel kind of defeated. I'm living day by day. Am I going to be all alone forever now? I'm 32, I work 3rd shift, will be switching to 2nd in a couple of months but still not a very \"normal\" schedule so makes it hard to spend time with people. \n\nSo, I'm just feeling empty today. 2 months ago I lost my best friend, I turn 32 tomorrow all alone and I'm not really sure what direction my life is headed but im doing my best to stay afloat.

It seemed so impossible to go on raising three school-aged kids alone. I would be strong for them during the day, but cry in the shower and at night.

My kids and I laugh about the funny things that he said and watch movies that he liked and honestly enjoy his memory. I have met an amazing man who is there for me even when I am still grieving. Making small life decisions alone no longer seems crippling. \n\nI know that grief has no timeline and for some it may be quicker than for others. But I just wanted to come back to this sub to remind those who are struggling that there is a light even when it seems impossible to go on and that you shouldn\u2019t feel ashamed or guilty about experiencing happiness even in the midst of grief. Your loved ones would not have wanted to bring you sadness. They would want to have been remembered for all of the joy that they brought to your life and to the lives of those around you. I know this sounds overly-simplistic, but I just wanted to share my experience. \n\nThis is going to sound insensitive but It makes me angry that my mother in law only wants to cry about him when we think or talk about him. I feel like she is making his life all about his death and all about her grief. \n\nHis life was so much more than that. His life is in he eyes of my kids and the inside jokes that we tell each other and the pictures on the wall of the beautiful memories that have shaped us into the people we are today. I refuse to wallow in the images of his emaciated body in a hospital bed because a life cut short does not negate all of the good that he did in the world and I will not rob my children\u2019s lives of his positivity because I want to hang on to the last few months of his life. \n\nI\u2019m not sure that this helps everyone, and it will probably make some people angry.

Almost seven years ago I broke up with my girlfriend of 5 years. She is 6 years older than me and this was my first relationship of over 5 months, and I was young when I got into it (started dating when I was 22 and broke up when I was 27).  We had sex for awhile after the breakup, but I was confused about a lot of feelings and at the time I didn\u2019t have the tools to communicate that I now possess in relationships. \n\nEarly on in the relationship once and later in about the second or third year I cheated on her (not sex but some oral and kissing). The guilt ate me up and though I loved her I was having a lot of guilt and felt like I didn\u2019t know myself as an adult, so I felt like I needed space. We broke up two years later. Eventually I was honest about the cheating. We even hooked up after that confession of guilt. Around the age of 29 I went to visit her with my (was our dog) and thought we were going to get back together, only to later be ignored because her roommate (and current boyfriend) made a grandiose gesture and left his serious relationship for her. I never stopped loving her, and by the time I got my shit together it was too late. I know she\u2019s probably gone forever, and she seems happy in her new life. I still feel the pain of guilt, though I\u2019ve forgiven myself for my mistakes, and  I regret not ever once really communicating what was going on in my young brain... I\u2019ve been in a couple relationships since, most recently a 2 year long relationship (I\u2019ll be 33 soon) and I\u2019ve learned how to communicate my needs, desires and feelings, and it almost makes me miss my ex even more because I know I could be a better partner now... tell me, does anyone have an effective technique for battling this type of grief? \n\nI miss her. It\u2019s been years now. I know I should be over it, but I truly feel I\u2019ve lost my soulmate. I blame myself for it ending, as I should...

On the day she died, she called me, frantic about her husband. He had died by suicide and she was alone. They married young, but he was the love of her life. Our call dropped, and I'm ashamed to say I was relieved in the moment because I had been having a long day and I did not know how to react. I texted her to make sure she was okay, and offered to have her come stay with me if she wanted company. She told me she had to talk to her husband's family the next day and that she was staying with a family friend. I think one of my biggest regrets in life will be taking her word for it. The next day, I found out about her death, and it feels like I have been spiraling ever since. Her funeral was genuinely the worst day of my life.\n\nMy mental health was already in a crummy place--I am a poor college student who grew up in an abusive household--but it feels like the worst manifestations of it have become more intense this year. I constantly fear that my loved ones secretly hate me and don't want me around, especially because the people in my life, for the most part, didn't know how to respond to my grief. After having a few awkward interactions I decided I didn't want to bother them with it, so I felt lonely. I am preoccupied with death and other morbid thoughts all the time, from worrying about my own untimely death or worrying that my dad (who is old and in poor health) will die.\n\nMy best friend's birthday is next week, and I feel like she has been on my mind more lately because of that. But in all, this year has been incredibly tough. I am coming up on my last year of undergrad, and I will be extremely busy with applying for grad school and preparing for the next stage of my life. I want to be able to give this the time that it deserves, but I don't want it to consume me to the point that I can't cope with daily life. I made it through last semester by the skin of my teeth and I don't want a repeat of that.\n\nI keep remembering the worst moments of our friendship and wishing I had been a better friend to her. She had endless faith in me and it feels like I didn't deserve it, especially with how I handled her last moments. When I went to her funeral, her god mom (who helped go through her things) said that she wrote about me often in her journals and drawing books. That meant a lot to me, but I can't help feeling like I didn't deserve that love and trust.\n\nI know that this is not something you \"get over,\" but I thought things would be a bit easier for me after how much time has passed. Does this ever get better? Has anyone had similar feelings? I am tired of feeling so desperately unhappy and unworthy of love.

In my 22 years of life I haven\u2019t seen my father much because of substance abuse issues and not staying in one place for too long so it was hard to keep track of him. Every few years or so I\u2019d see him but before I knew it, he\u2019d be gone again. Not for a moment was I ever angry with him, even as a child. I understood he loved me and wanted to be more involved. I want to say I was eight or nine years old when I last saw him, and when I was thirteen I moved from Louisiana to Indiana so there was definitely no way I would have seen him again.\n\n I finished high school there and moved back home, and the following year reached out to him with the help of my maternal grandmother. I still have the letters he sent me to this day, because it\u2019s one of the only things I have to remember him by. We rebuilt a relationship that I\u2019ll always be grateful for, but I knew he still struggled with the problems that kept him from me. Sometimes he successfully stayed sober, and sometimes he\u2019d call or leave strange texts that were obviously done while under the influence (in those moments I wouldn\u2019t respond because I didn\u2019t know how to). \n\nSometimes he\u2019d ask me to get lunch with him, and I never did - not out of malice but because I guess I was so preoccupied with school and work. The last I spoke to him was Christmas of 2018. A few months ago, I was coming home from school and got a call from my grandma that she needed to talk to me and it was important.\n\nI learned he\u2019d passed away the prior week. My father was adopted and I wasn\u2019t close with that side of the family because he wasn\u2019t (although I spent many weekends and summers with them as a child). It took one week for his adoptive family to inform us of his death, yet it took not even five minutes for my mother to find his sister on Facebook to send a message of condolences (they also spoke on the phone of course so she could give her my number). \n\nHis sister called me the next day and we spoke for a while. I found out she donated most of his clothes to the homeless shelter he stayed at and they had a funeral service that I had no idea about. \n\nI am his only blood relative, and I was kept in the dark throughout this whole situation. I just want to know if it\u2019s justified for me to be angry with them for this. It\u2019s wonderful and noble for her to donate his clothes, but he and I connected over conversations of music and I know he had plenty of band shirts. I couldn\u2019t even have one of those? I couldn\u2019t have anything of his before it was all gone?\n\nThe anger I\u2019m feeling towards them is real, but isn\u2019t nearly as intense as the guilt for not speaking to him since Christmas. I can\u2019t even put it into words. He beat himself up so harshly for not always being around and believed so strongly I was angry with him, but I never had anything but love and understanding in my heart. The regret of not telling him this more often, of not being more involved and reassuring, it weighs so heavily on me that I\u2019m on a waitlist for a therapist. I don\u2019t know how long I have to wait. It\u2019s unbearable.\n\nI\u2019m sorry if this is incoherent or sloppy. I just feel like an awful person.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Crazy, obscene, LONG, can a post be too long?!?! Also, longtime lurker and first ever post. Throwaway to protect children. \n\nI've wanted to put this to \"paper\" for some time, 1. to maybe make someone else feel less alone or maybe make them feel better about their own grief and choices and 2. just get it all out there. Wish I could be more public and detailed but my children would never understand and be devastated beyond repair.\n\nSeveral years ago my spouse died in a horrific accident very near our home. We had 2 adolescent/teen children at the time. He was a big fish in a little pond and he was very well known in his industry in the US. His death was publicized like national news in our little town. There will never be words for my(our)loss, devastation, shock, heartache. We had been together since we were teens. Every major life experience we shared together and then some. He was my best friend. And to keep it real, he was also human and could be an absolute asshole, me as well. After more than 20 years together we knew each others best and worst sides and had fought and worked hard to keep a healthy, happy marriage. Most of the time we were great together but we had few years mixed in there of not being as happy as we wanted to be. We were on a great path at the end. \n\nHis death rocked my world and turned me numb to the core. I was suicidal for many months although I dont think anyone else saw it beyond just normal grief. As much as I was dying on the inside I would absolutely die before I brought more suffering to my children. We cried, talked, laughed, mourned, shut down, grieved and moved inch by inch for a long time. We talked about him, (and still do), like he was in the room. We celebrated his birthday and honored his memory and humor at every opportunity. He was the life of every party and to suddenly lose that energy changed every moment of our lives. None of us started therapy until atleast 6 months after. Too raw to dig too deep. But we kept it very real and open at home and with friends. There were no filters about any emotion. I also made an effort to find activities that would get us laughing and finding moments of joy in life. For me, grief and sorrow doesnt mean there can't still be smiles and laughter. \n\nTo the throwaway matter....All of the above being stated, I started having an unintentional relationship 6 weeks after his death. The relationship was with grade school/high school bestfriend that had been off the radar for 20 years. He called to offer condolences and slowly turned right back into my bestfriend/therapist/lover. The connection was as if time had never stopped for us. He listened to my endless tears and breakdowns and nightmares. He held my hand when I was lost and wanted to die. He cried for me when I cried when we made love. My family quickly discovered my relationship and was SO disapproving and judgemental! My behavior didn't fit their mold for grief. We all agreed the children could not know. The children to this day have NO idea and I hope never will. They could never understand such devastating loss and love in the same breadth, nor do most. This guy is no longer a romantic partner but still my best friend. Although most, including a therapist, would say I had no idea what I was doing and was only distracting myself from my grief, this guy was what got me through my grief. He helped me heal in a way no therapist ever could have. The endless, exhausting, emotional rollercoaster he supported at all hours was more than selfless.The heart has abundant room for love that doesnt have to labeled or categorized. As obscene, controversial and confusing as my hasty relationship was to everyone else and sometimes even myself, I have zero regrets. That new relationship did not change my grief, or sorrow or heartache. It only showed me that love is endless and true love doesnt die when a body does. For me, I felt that giving up would disrespect the life my husband lost. I am still privileged to be here living a healthy life and must keep living and enjoying life to honor him and the sacrifices he made taking care of us. 4 years later, it's still not always easy. There are still days I fall to a heap and stay sobbing for hours, but those days are few and far between now. I have found love again that my children are aware of, if not cautiously. Life keeps moving and I have chosen to honor that gift and keep moving as well, sometimes hour by hour full of sorrow, and sometimes just like the good old days with laughter and joy for days on end. Either way my husband is in the background for every moment.\n\nThere is absolutely hope within grief if you are willing to be patient and let go of fear and judgement and knowing new love and joy doesn't mean forgetting the past.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He remarried very soon after my grandmother divorced him (after years of mental and physical abuse that almost drove her to suicide more than once, as well as numerous affairs and spending most of his time on drugs and drinking heavily) and my mother told him that he wasn\u2019t allowed to skip in and out of my sister and I\u2019s lives\u2014 if he wanted to be granddaddy Glenn, he had to act like it. He chose to raise his second wife\u2019s grandkids instead, putting them into fancy private schools and buying them cars while my family went through quite a bit of time where debt piled up and we didn\u2019t know if we\u2019d have money for groceries. \n\nWhen I was about ten years old, he sobered up, and came to tell us he was a born-again Christian and had changed. He made a lot of promises then: he\u2019d take us to Disney world, and build a Bear, and buy us whatever we wanted from the mall. Did he keep a single one of his promises? Nope, he disappeared, time and time again. He\u2019d see us at a funeral or the family reunion, make a bunch of promises, and go back to raising his step-grandchildren while acting like my sister and I didn\u2019t exist. He\u2019s about as close to me as those cousins you see once every year or two at a big family gathering or funeral, where you only remember their name because you asked your mom first. Sure, I know who he is and that he\u2019s my grandfather because my mother made sure I knew, but I\u2019m not even sure he knows what I\u2019m studying in college. He\u2019s never sent a single birthday card, or called to see how I was doing, or even acknowledged my high school or associates degree graduation. His sister, my great aunt, has been to almost every chorus concert and theatre production without fail, and showed up at my graduation with $50 bucks and a page long letter in the card. I\u2019m not even sure if Glenn bothered to read the graduation announcement. \n\nHe hasn\u2019t been there for anything, so why do I hurt so bad now that he took his last breath a little under thirty hours ago? Why does my chest physically hurt when I think about how I don\u2019t have any memories to talk about at his funeral (because no one wants to remember how he couldn\u2019t keep a promise to get his ten year old granddaughter a $20 stuffed animal when you\u2019re supposed to be uplifting the dead in praise) or any pictures of us together to put on Facebook in memorial? Why do I feel angry at the thought of spending five hours at his visitation tonight\u2014missing almost all of my last D&amp;D session before I move three hours away for college\u2014 when he never spent more than five minutes talking to me when he was alive. This wasn\u2019t a sudden death, this happened after three months in hospice completely aware of his surroundings and KNOWING he wouldn\u2019t make it to February at all, if he even made it to thanksgiving. I\u2019m going to have to drink at least two Mike\u2019s Hard Lemonades before I go to the funeral home tonight, because the very thought of spending what could have been time with people I enjoy, instead being with consoling others over a man I have so much bitterness and anger towards, makes me angrier all over again. Why should I do what is expected of me as his granddaughter when he never did what was expected of him as my grandfather? He doesn\u2019t deserve my time, not after he wasted so much of my life. My mother keeps telling me he\u2019s been living in regret for over twenty-five years, but that\u2019s not good enough\u2014 if he truly regretted it, he should have tried to reach out to me. His regret means nothing to me if he didn\u2019t actually use it to make amends. \n\nHe\u2019s given me nothing to mourn, so why the hell am I crying over the fact we never got a relationship? Why can\u2019t I sleep at all because I can\u2019t get my mind to shut down and my emotions to settle? Why does my chest hurt so bad it feels like my heart is carving its way out of my chest? How the hell do I get through this when I\u2019m not grieving a person, but the relationship we should have had to begin with?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Basically, I didn't think about it much, but when I did, I remembered it fondly. \n\nWe kept in touch, checking in on holidays, birthdays, maybe 4 or 5 times a year. Lately we were both single and there was some reminiscing. She suggested I come visit her sometime, I planned on making it happen soon but life always got in the way. \n\nWent to post something on her facebook the other day and found that her page had been memorialized. Googled her name and she died over a month ago. Probably drug or alcohol related, maybe a suicide. They found her in a pond behind a walmart. just a brutally grim end to her life. I talked to her 10 days before, she said things were really good, better than they had been in a while. \n\nI feel decimated by this. I've been drinking each night since I found out, going through ancient conversations and photos -- stuff I didn't even do when we broke up -- , listening to songs I associate with the year we were together, failing to hold back tears.  I haven't told too many people because it all seems too heavy and too obscure. And maybe a little pathetic, like I'm holding on to this ancient relationship.

Really, she's technically my cousin's daughter, but she's always been as close as a good cousin to me, especially since we're both the same age.\n\nIn my family, family is valued a lot.

The thing is that I've felt like this before, and that was during the months I had terrible anxiety. It also seems like I feel detached from my body because I can't grasp the fact that she has really passed away or something...\n\nDo you think I'm in denial, or is anxiety a part of grief?

On Wednesday the 14th of August he was attacked by a feral and ran off across the road to a place we cannot access and search. He's most likely so close that he can come out of whatever hidey hole he's found and come home. But, he's a massive scaredy cat that only really knows how to be an indoor cat. Its Saturday morning and I've prepared for the reality of him never coming home. Wherever he is, I fear he is stuck and unable to return.\n\nLast year he's brother was stolen from our then home and never returned. It has been a painful 18 months without him and the loss of my only cat this week has pushed me over the edge. I've had an extremely difficult year, I had knee surgery, I'm currently in the 13th month of looking for permanent employment and have realised my microbiology degree is effectively uselss. A ton of other small things have happened to frustrate and pain me, but through all this I had my cat.\n\nA 7kg bundle of pure love and affection. Through the 6 years I've had him he has provided nothing but love and affection during even my darkest hours. He's been a better companion than any human has ever been. He's a large grey ball of love, companionship and understanding . Everyday when I'd get home, I'd hear that distinct meowing as I walk up the steps from the underground parking, \"Human! You're home! I've missed you!\". That's what those distinct meows of excitement meant. As soon as I'd locked up and put my things done, it meant snuggle time and carrying the tiny little emperor (his newest nickname) around.\n\nWhen I didn't hear that on Wednesday I knew something was wrong. Immediately my gut told me I had to find him and he was gone. I was right as confirmed by the groundskeeper and a security guard next door. He had run off in a panic after being attacked by a feral. I knew where he was but had no access to the area as the groundskeeper there was uncooperative and spiteful. She refused to let us in to even search or let us call a resident or the owner for permission to search. Google has no answers for me as to who owns the building or the individual apartments. Somewhere he's frightened, hungry and alone. I've been sick with worry and have done everything in my power to get him back and to search for him. But I don't think he'll be coming home. It's been so long that I'm sure he can't find his way back anymore.\n\nHe's never been just a cat, he's always been a part of my family, a small fuzzy pawed part but a part non the less. In his small green eyes I've seen more love and affection for me than anyone else has ever shown and it hurts more than words can describe knowing I only had 6 years with him. There hasn't been a single moment in those 6 years I regretted adopting him. Him and his brother were the two most loving animals I've ever owned. The loss of both of them in a year and half has crushed me completely. I can't eat or sleep properly and crying has just been part of what I do for the last few days. \n\nI've never felt more alone in the world than now. He may have been \"just a cat\" but he's my cat. He's my small ray of sunshine in the dark world and now he's gone. I miss him more and more as every hour passes. He was a source of comfort during the time I had him and a constant unwavering source at that. \n\nI'll always love you my fuzzybutt, you're still my favourite person even if you're just a cat.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Even the doctors said it was a miracle. She was a miracle.\n\nAnyone with experience with TBI can attest that it\u2019s hard. The struggle doesn\u2019t end after they leave to hospital. We butted heads over stupid things a lot those first few years. But we always made up eventually. You know, sister stuff. You love them, you hate them, you love them again lol\n\nShe had several conditions that caused her severe daily pain. She rarely complained. She never gave up. I can\u2019t emphasize how strong she was. I could never be half as strong as her. \n\nLast year she actually moved out on her own. Then a few months ago she stopped answering my moms texts, so she asked her roommate to check in on her. She was unresponsive on the floor. He did CPR and gave first aid until paramedics arrived. She survived thanks to him. She died and came back yet again. She spent like a week in the hospital (causing trouble and being stubborn for the drs, typical of her lol) and after this she moved in with her dad to be monitored better. The drs figure she went into anaphylaxis again and couldn\u2019t get to her epipen in time.\n\nShe was so happy to be with her dad (we have different dads) They\u2019ve had issues in the past, Custody battle and stuff, but they were getting along very well and she was so happy there. We were all closer together so I saw her a lot again. Id never admit it, but I missed her a lot when she moved out. The whole family was happy. It seemed like things might be looking up. \n\nOn Thursday she stopped answering my moms texts. She asked her dad to check on her so he finished what he was doing and headed to her room. She was already gone. He called my mom but she could barely understand him he was beside himself. I had my shoes on by the time she got off the phone. I\u2019ll never forget us sitting in the car, her turning to me and going \u201care you sure you want to come?\u201d I just said \u201cyes\u201d and she started the car. \n\nWhen we got there I ran ahead, passing the ambulance outside I asked \u201cis she in there?\u201d And the paramedic just said no. I just ran inside. There was a cop blocking her door. I turned to her dad who was sobbing in the kitchen and said \u201cdid they give up?\u201d And he just shook his head. I must\u2019ve sounded crazy to the policewoman because I turned to her and said \u201clisten to me, she dies all the time, you just have to keep trying. She will come back. Just keep trying. She does this all the time.\u201d \n\nShe just told me they\u2019d tried all they could. That she was gone. I asked to see her, thinking in my head somehow I could do CPR and bring her back myself since they\u2019d given up. They said I couldn\u2019t see her until the medical examiner arrived and did his thing. So I waited for hours while he finished his thing. I was there with my parents, her dad, our little sister, and my grandma. I waited and waited. When he was done I asked to see her. They said I couldn\u2019t. I said just her hand. Let me hold her hand. Just let me touch her hand. They wouldn\u2019t. That\u2019s the point I just lost it screaming and crying and being hysterical. I just wanted to hold my big sissy\u2019s hand. Just for a second. They wouldn\u2019t let me. \n\nThe ME was obviously suspicious about such a young woman dying unexpectedly and was treating it almost as a crime scene. All they told us about what they think happened was that it appeared she was eating cherries and it\u2019s possible she choked. Now if she survived all the shit she has, just to die by choking on a fucking cherry, I might just lose it. I won\u2019t be able to handle that. Anything but the fucking cherry I can accept. Not. The. Fucking. Cherry.\n\nSo she was supposed to have an autopsy yesterday, we might be getting some answers today but the full report is going to take a long time. Today we\u2019re meeting with some funeral homes. I know she\u2019d want to be cremated. She always talks about that jewelry with ashes in them, and she thought they were great. The thing is if I don\u2019t see her I will never accept that she\u2019s dead. I\u2019ve been laying awake all night convincing myself that there are tons of stories of people coming back to life in freezers and it being a miracle. She\u2019s a miracle, why wouldn\u2019t she come back in a damn freezer? That sounds exactly like something she\u2019d do. I know it\u2019s illogical. I need to see her. Just her hand even. I just need to touch her to convince myself it\u2019s real. I don\u2019t want her embalmed and to have a whole viewing ceremony, I just want to touch her hand for a second. I don\u2019t care how fucked up she looks. That stuff doesnt get me. I don\u2019t even have to see the rest of her. Just her hand. Something. Her hair. I don\u2019t care. I just need to see her. If they don\u2019t let me I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get over it. \n\nEither way we\u2019re still telling loved ones. What the fuck is wrong with people who hear and immediately post shit to Facebook. Not everyone knows yet, just keep your fucking mouth shut for 2 god damn days until we finish the obituary at least. We haven\u2019t posted shit about it, it\u2019s not your place to out us. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a message of support, fucking private message it to us then. They think the attention they get on Facebook is more important than our privacy and chance to tell certain people before it\u2019s blasted all over the god damn internet. I\u2019m fucking done with it. \n\nSorry this is long and angry. I just need to put this somewhere. Otherwise I will blow up on people. I still might but you know.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

In 1993 I lost my mom, and that year my older brother left to go to college on another island where he now lives.  \n\n  \nMy dad raised me alone for a while, did his best, we had little money but did the best we could.  \n  \nHe remarried in 2002ish.  \n\nIn 2017 I was driving my dad to a hospital way out of town for a doctor visit, he didnt tell me what it was for, as we pull in he tells me \"Dont freak out, were here for a cancer doc\". We do some tests in the hospital and leave, about halfway home we get a call from the hospital to come back immediately. What happened then was finding out he had a brain tumor and was then flown to another hospital with stepmom riding, this was it I thought and hd th worst drive home.  \n  \nMy brother got me a plane ticket to go see dad and we stayed in the hospital and went though his recovery and treatments, it was then he was told by doctors he'd need to start taking insulin injections and limit his diet.  \n  \nWe get home and dad and stepmom couldn't do the injections so I took over it, and his medication, and watching his diet and limiting carbs, even if it meant fast food was what he wanted that was okay with limits. Shortly after we learn that the brain tumor was limiting his vision so he couldn't drive. Stepmom doesnt know how to drive so i took on this responsibility too.  \n  \nThings are going ok, I'm doing the best I can for him. In January 2019 we get another scare. He just passes out hard on the toilet and 911 is called, it was a result of low blood pressure  but still a scary week in the hospital leading to his recovery.  \n  \nIn July 2019, he started to have a lot of difficulty walking, and has been stubborn about it. In august of 2019 we take him to the hospital simply because we cannot get him up off his chair, he cant walk and is in too much pain. We learn his cancer spread to his lungs.  he sharply deteriorates over a very stressful week leading to his passing in hospice.  \n  \nNow I'm just, feeling so alone. My brother is here but I'm so uncertain about the future and overcome with loss. For the last 2 years dad became my full time job and I would not trade it for a thing, we got to spent a lot of time together but it was lots of work and scares in trying to manage him.

And when he went back to school, none of his peers would bring it up because they were scared to upset him.\n\nThis resulted in him going almost a decade with acting like she never existed and just pushing all the negative emotions away.

He was essentially like a little brother I never had. Being only half a year younger than me and sharing most interests, we spent time together almost always, feeling like he really was someone who finally cared about me and understood me, and he felt like someone I had to look out for, to protect. We made so many plans together, for the future, some of which were rather ridiculous looking back (since back then we were 14), but some actually even got into their early execution phases, like actually forming application letters for universities. We shared many hobbies at the time, being sneakerheads, loving the same movies and songs, snowboarding and parkour/freerunning. Every weekend we would meet up and do some jumps, usually on roofs. One day, we went on top of trains. That I would concider one of the best days I ever lived.\n\nOne day I moved away, from Switzterland to Italy. Funny enough, I found it harder to part from him than from my current girlfriend. About 2 months after I moved, I was sitting in my room when my friend from Switzerland called me, informing me that Jelle had been transported to the hospital in critical conditions. At first I did not believe, but as she explained I understood it was not a joke. He had climbed the trains again, to re-live some memories. Except this time, he got too close and got hit by a very high voltage from the cables above the rail-way. \n\nDuring his coma, I was supporting his two younger sisters, Eva and Roos. Roos, being the older one, about 13 at the time kept me in course about everything. I was in school at the time, writing my English exam when she texted me to call her ASAP. I excused myself to the bathroom, and called her. She said that they have decided to disconnect Jelle\u00b4s life support, as he was in huge pain. He was alone in a hospital room for days, in pain because 75 percent of his skin had burnt. Accepting the fact that he was living his last hours, I asked Roos to ask Jelle whether or not he remembered me (he had amnesia which affected his last 2 months) and that \"I felt blessed and honored to have a friend like Jelle.\" and went back to class. \n\nAt around 6am the next day Roos wrote to me, that Jelle had passed away at 5:30am. What haunted me the most, was that when Roos told Jelle what I asked her to, he actually started displaying sadness. Before this he did not. He was happy to die. Until that moment. \n\n11 days later his funeral took place at which I was lucky enough to hold a speech. \n\nNow here comes why I came here, looking for help. I have not felt any sort of pain, grief or whatsoever up until two months ago. Of course, I was sad at first. Lost a friend, never get to see him again. But it passed me as fast as it came. I thought about it a lot, considered myself a really bad human being. But here we are, almost two years later, and I feel ready to give anything to see Jelle again. I started dreaming about him, missing him, finding more and more moments that remind me of him in which I think \"Damn, I wish he could be here. He would love that\". Even thoughts about the fact that I introduced him to parkour, which essentially killed him, meaning I partially killed him keep crossing me. I feel overwhelmed by this, and even talking to my parents, or even my girlfriend does not help. She simply has too many aspects that remind him of me. I feel like nobody understands me really. So I came here, looking for help. How do I deal with this? With my last two highschool years coming up, I really am feeling anxious, and this situation is not helping. Any sort of support is very appretiated.\n\nI apologize for the huge text and wish eveyone a blessed day.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My brother tells me to slow down, don't rush into anything. I tell him that I'm not looking for anything serious - I just want a little company now and then to go to a show or find someone to do things together, instead of staying home and feeling sad on a weekend night, is that too much to ask? \"You need to learn to sit at home alone without feeling sad\" he says. I ask to borrow my friend's lipstick. \"Where are you going now?\" he asks. I'm going to hear a live band at a local bar just a few minutes from my house. I don't have a date, I just want to hear some live music. He just shakes his head at me.\n\nHe didn't spend 30 of his formative years with his soulmate. He didn't watch that person die in his arms suddenly and unexpectedly. He just knows his older sister is going out for the evening, and he doesn't like it.\n\nI'm at the bar, the music is rocking. The bar is hot, so I step outside to get some air. A good looking woman I've never met before sits beside me. She talks to me like she's known me all my life. She takes my hand and leads me back onto the dance floor. At one point she kisses me. Another woman joins us. The three of us are all feeling the beat of the bass, dancing to every song, letting go of all our cares and worries for a few hours. We've all experienced loss and sorrow, but for tonight we will put it behind us for a while. Sometimes we slow dance, sometimes we rock out. Everyone is having a great time. It's exhilarating. I haven't gone out dancing like this in decades. \n\nFinally it's time for me to go home. I get in my car, and can't fight back the tears. This would be the point in the evening I would be coming home to him - to tell him about the hot brunette hitting on me, to tell him how the band rocked, and to take him to our bed and finish out the evening as only we did best. Only he's not there. And this giant empty hole in my chest feels like my soul has been ripped out through my rib cage. And I wipe my eyes so I can see to drive.\n\nSo yeah, sometimes we rock out and dance the night away, because it's the only way to temporarily shoo away the demons that follow over our shoulder constantly reminding us that our world was shattered, that we will never love that way again. Sometimes sweating and dancing and crying to a rock band is like a ritual of healing, because we are still living and breathing creatures, grasping to celebrate the life our loved ones helped us create. And sometimes we hold out hope that we can still find some measure of peace and joy in the life we have remaining.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I've known that family since I started middle school, over half of my life.\n\nThe police are calling it a suicide. We don't know for sure but it wouldn't surprise me if they were right. I've spent the last ten years or so taking turns, talking my friends and acquaintances down from suicide. I've done it so much that I once called a hotline for help and, within a minute of picking up, the person on the other end told me \"you clearly have experience with this\" and couldn't give me any more advice. I always knew it would only be a matter of time before I failed to save someone, before I didn't reach out soon enough or didn't read the cues or didn't answer a phone call when the other person needed my help. And I can't shake the feeling that this was my fault somehow.\n\nWhen I first heard the news, I was devastated and locked myself in my room for a few hours. And then I thought, my best friend needs comfort more than I do so I need to get over this faster and be there for her. And I compartmentalized and repressed my reaction and now I sort of can't feel anything.\n\nI don't know how I should be feeling or reacting, whether I'm grieving too much or not enough.

Less? Am I allowed to want comfort when someone else might need me to be strong for them? Am I allowed to give comfort when I should be a mess right now?

I want to tell you about someone because I\u2019m not understanding the point. I know life will go on as it does, people survive things like this all the time. But what is the point for me?  \n\nI (25f) met this guy (28m) on Hinge, I had no expectations out of this date, quite frankly I didn\u2019t even want to go anymore. I had had a long week, I was broke and didn\u2019t want to be bothered but, I am a woman of my word. \n\n\nI\u2019ll never say I am one to believe in love at first sight, but there was something because when my gaze met his for the first time, there was a spark. He was different. We were different together. It was honestly like a movie. For instance, after our hours long first date, it was Monday morning and time for me to go home. \n\nWe had scheduled my Uber for 12:00 pm. It was now 11:55 am and my driver was on his way( Now that I\u2019m thinking about it I called off that day to be able to have more time with him, boy am I happy I did now) he was sitting on the edge of his bed and pulled me down to straddle him when Al Greens \u201clet\u2019s stay together\u201d starts playing on his speaker. It was just so funny because honestly, could you even THINK of anything cheesier happening? Truthfully, neither one of us wanted me to go. I kinda pulled back from the hug and looked at him, those bright blue eyes shimmering and he\u2019s grinning, that big smile stretching ear to ear and says\u201d what I didn\u2019t plan this\u201d. \n\n\nAnd so, that is how things went for us. Our time together was just, on fire. He was going to take me fishing and shooting. We were going to go four wheeling and ride dirt bikes. He was supposed to teach me how to play guitar, he was my skydiving buddy. Everything we said we were going to do together, I will do. I\u2019ll do them but I know I\u2019ll have him with me. I feel so strange because I had him for such a short time, but there\u2019s this lasting impact he\u2019s made on me. We never ended up officially initiating a romantic relationship. As time went on as life goes, we get busy. We got little more distant than what I liked but he was always there and assessable if I needed him. I got so comfortable and used to that idea. I was in the process of looking for a car and an apartment. He had bought a house about an hour away and had to be to work at 3am so that made it hard. \n\nThe thing about it is, we still had time together. We would be on the phone for hours on end. A lot of times he stayed up way too late with me. We were like teenagers, honestly. It was just such an authentic \u201cI like you\u201d. And when we could get together in person I can\u2019t even describe the feeling he made me feel. He was so trusting, he\u2019d give me his phone, which was always funny because it was an android and I had the hardest time learning how to use it so I could never figure it out. I was always the DJ and he would tell me \u201cJust download the music you play\u201d so I could have my choices cycled through when we were together and so he could learn them. So simple, but that was the beauty of him. \n\nThere was so much going on in those eyes and the way that man looked at me. Every time he looked at me, i just felt it. He had such an admiration for me and I don\u2019t understand it because in my eyes he was the one. It\u2019s just, I\u2019ve always heard of people having people like this. I just never thought I would be one.   \n\nHe taught me so much in the little time I had him. We made so many plans together. The last time we spoke, I told him I missed him and he told me he missed me too and that he had just been busy with work and renovating his house, but that we needed to get together again. He normally would reach out to me at least, at the very least once a week and that is from the last time one of us messaged each other. I was a little salty and worried as it had been just over a week and that never happened . Seeing as how things were so busy for both of us and I didn\u2019t have a car. \n\nI am A reason that there was distance. Not because I didn\u2019t want him but because I honestly have self esteem issues and doubted him wanting me, I will work on that. (I\u2019ve even found myself doubting my validity to be grieving while writing this)I blamed it on (and still want to) blame it on the fact that I didn\u2019t have a car. It\u2019s stupid, I didn\u2019t want him to try and go above and beyond for me, I told myself it wasn\u2019t fair, that in order to be in a functional relationship and to be equal and fair to him, I needed a car first. \n\nAnyway, on this past Friday, I went to message him but decided to try Facebook first, just to check and then found out he had died on Tuesday and it was Friday, no reason why posted and no funeral details. Up until that point I had only met his mom and that wasn\u2019t planned and probably shouldn\u2019t have happened so soon. I reached out to his brother solely based on the fact that I had to. He got back with me quite promptly and told me thank you and that he had mentioned me often and was definitely a fan of mine as well. I was also invited to the memorial service they are having for him.  I was shocked but honestly it warmed my heart and I will be going. \n\nThere\u2019s so much more. So much that I can\u2019t say because it wasn\u2019t said. But also because some things do go without saying. This is hard. He was more than I ever expected. I am so hurt and confused. We had so much shit to do together. It just feels like I lost him at the beginning of our journey and I just don\u2019t understand why.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My dad took my mother to the hospital where she was admitted. They did an angiogram and found 4 blockages in her heart.\n\nThey then moved my mother to a hospital down in Ogden, Utah, between the Salt Lake City and Cache Valley area (I live in SLC, parents in Cache Valley). She was to undergo cardiac bypass surgery. Mom was in okay shape, in good spirtis, but her blood pressure was too high, and her body had already undergone so much in the last year that this was concerning to me\nI thought she might die. But I stop, and think: She's only 74. Everything will turn out fine.\n\nWe take my sister's kids for the weekend and go back to Salt Lake so my sister and dad who live at my parent's house can get some rest.\n\nOn August 5th, the hospital perform surgery on my mother. Things went as the surgeon expected, except they found 5 blockages and doubt one of them would take. They being my mother to the ICU and she's coherent at some point, saying people's names, and she isn't all there, but who is after open heart surgery? Eventually things start to heal and she is able to hold my dad's hand. I was working that day and checked in on the surgery throughout the workday.\n\nOn August 6th, I go up to visit after work. Mom is really tired from all of the drugs and stuff. We get some words out of her, but not too much. Me and my dad get food in the cafeteria and I go back to Salt Lake for work the next day, and I don't see my mother the following day, but I call to check up on Dad.\n\nOn August 8th, my dad and nephew have gone back up to Cache Valley to sleep the night. Mom has a longer recovery ahead than we thought. None of the family is to be with her on Thursday night as we've been up and down like crazy the past few days, so I decide to go to the hospital to keep mom company. I walk into the ICU room and she is on a breathing tube.\n\nI remember the sunset, colors of blue and orange, a rainy night with an interesting sundown. I stayed with my mother at the hospital until 9:40PM, seeing if there were any little things I could do to make her feel more comfortable. I got a warm blanket, held her hand, talked to her, said goodbye, and left to go back to Salt Lake for work the following day.\n\nAt 10:03PM, my sister who is a cardiac ICU nurse calls me to see how mom is doing. At 10:15PM, my other sister calls me and tells me to turn the car around and head back to Ogden. I call the hospital for details, and they say her heart stopped pumping, and they had to do CPR for 2 minutes to get her back.\n\nThe hospital called all of the family to the ICU. We were all there by 11:40PM, and they were having doubts about being able to sustain her as she may have cardiovascular shock or sepsis, and her blood pressure is too low, her organs are shutting down, and the only option left is CRRT dialysis. We try this for about 7 hours, and not even a tiny improvement is happening, she is continuing to decline.\n\nThe family reconvines once more slightly past 8AM on Friday morning, and we discuss my mother's end of life documents. It says in the documents not to keep her on life support if there is a chance she will not recover or will be permanently handicapped, and the doctors determined we were well past that point. She was on so much medication keeping her alive that there was nothing left to be done, and the only sustainable way was to keep her on the maxed out doses of what she was already on, which was starting to cause very negative side-effects as well.\n\nShortly after 1PM, my sister who works in another hospital in the Cardiac ICU ward began to advise the nurses on which dosages of which medication to lower that would stop my mother's heart from beating, as the nurses injected fentanyl to help mom with amy pain. My sister was living her worst nightmare, she was essentially advising the nurses on how our mother should die. A large amount of family gathered around the room as we watched mom go for 120bpm to flatline within 20 minutes. By 1:42pm, she was pronounced dead.\n\nEveryone said their goodbyes once more as my mother laid dead on the hospital bed, and me and my partner were the last ones to leave. I stood there, my dead mother in front of me, my face wet with tears, with no more medical equipment connected, my mother's mouth agape, and dead. I knew what I was seeing, but I didn't want to believe it.\n\nOn August 15th, we laid my mom to rest, putting on a spectacular funeral service for her which our family and our friends were very moved by. The funeral was quite packed. I got up and spoke, failing to hold my words together as I read one of the last messages I sent to her and got back from her. They were messages of gratefulness, love, and joy. A mother and son's love. \n\nIt is now August 19th, I've returned to work, and I'm incredibly depressed. I got a tiny raise and received more good news at work today, and I almost always call Mom when I get news like this, because she just adores hearing it and gushing over how amazing her kids are. Now mom is no longer there.\n\nIt's hard to describe what this is like. I've never had someone so close to me die before. I'm very saddened that she won't see me get married, watch more of her grandchildren grow to be adults, or be with my father.\n\nI miss my mom.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Since she was diagnosed 6 months ago, nothing has been the same. Her cancer is only getting worse and she has been given a likely timeline of only a few more months. Everyday I am grieving a loss that is to come. I torture myself with sad thoughts on a daily basis. Imagining when things take a turn for the worse, when she decides to surrender to the cancer (right now she's still trying to fight and undergoing treatment), playing in my head how her final days will be, if it will be painful or peaceful for her, how on earth will I get through her funeral, etc.  All of those things. That\u2019s why anticipatory grief is so hard. When my dad passed away unexpectedly, it was extremely hard, but you\u2019re able to start the grieving process right away. With this, it\u2019s a daily fear and worry and anticipation. It\u2019s both a blessing and a curse. A blessing to be able to tie up loose ends and let nothing go unsaid (which is such a gift. I didn\u2019t get that with my dad), but it\u2019s SO hard to get through.\n\nIt is so hard to think of having our final goodbye or our final conversation, knowing that the time is nearing. I think that is the hardest scenario for me to picture - when she's in hospice and still coherent, knowing she is about to die and us saying everything we want to say to each other. Telling her that she is the best mom I could have ever asked for and that I will go on honoring her, remembering her, loving her and making her proud. We have had those conversations already, but the finality of knowing \"this is really the end\" and having to have that conversation one last time is more than I can even bear to think about.\n\nI'm also struggling with all of the milestones in my life that she is going to miss out on. I am the only one out of my siblings who has yet to be married or have children. She got to be there for all of those milestones for my siblings and they were some of the proudest moments of her life. She loves her Grandchildren more than anything. Being a Grandmother is her pride and joy. The fact that my future children won't get to know and love her, and vice versa, puts my heart in wrenches.

My great uncle a couple days before my great aunt\u2019s birthday. And now my grandpa. Two weeks after my birthday, 9 days after his birthday, and the day of my cousin\u2019s 8th birthday.\n\nMy grandpa had been in the hospital for almost a month. He ignored a really really bad cough, loss of appetite, and overall unwell feeling for what we speculate to have been many months. \n\nHe initially went to the doctor for it, and was told it was a UTI. He got a couple shots and was sent home. Two days later he went back to the hospital with chest pains and was then diagnosed with moderate COPD (heavy smoker for years), severe pneumonia, low kidney function, and extremely low sodium. I don\u2019t know how these people missed that the first time\u2014they did bloodwork both times, but somehow it\u2019s just a UTI and then two days later his body is basically shutting down?\n\nTwo nights later he had a heart attack and was rushed to a bigger hospital about an hour away, but he survived. He was doing good. Another couple of days and he has a second, bigger heart attack. This time they put him in an induced coma and place a breathing tube. He had that in place for ten days? Maybe more. His kidneys were failing, his liver was barely functioning (history of extreme alcoholism but sober for 10+ years), and his blood was very thick. \n\nHis pneumonia just kept getting worse. They found a small spot where he was bleeding into his lungs. Even after they stopped the sedatives and paralytics he didn\u2019t wake up for days, because his body couldn\u2019t metabolize and get rid of them from his system. \n\nIt looked so grim. \n\nBut then, he started getting better! They started dialysis and he began to wake up. After a day or two he was alert, commanding, communicating through writing, sitting up, moving around, etc. They took his breathing tube out the day after they had made plans to perform a tracheotomy. \n\nHe did so so well. He was moving between the hospital bed and a chair. Talking. He was actually talking! It looked like he was really going to beat this and go home. His pneumonia was stable and not getting worse, his kidneys were getting better, his liver was doing better. \n\nHe kept talking all day about how he was ready to go home. He wanted to be home... I\u2019m realizing now maybe he somehow knew it was time for him to go \u201chome.\u201d To be with God. He wanted ice cream. He kept asking for it, but he couldn\u2019t have it. \u201cMaybe tomorrow you can have some ice cream, Grandpa.\u201d \n\nBut then last night, his heart just stopped. Flat lined. Out of nowhere. They resuscitated him, and my mother, grandmother, and I rushed to make it back up there in time to say goodbye and be with him.\n\nHe was gone for 6 minutes the first time. Then it happened again... he was dead before we made it there. When we arrived we walked into his room to see him grey, lifeless, and cold. They didn\u2019t call to tell us. They just let us show up and find out for ourselves. None of his other kids from his previous marriage before my grandmother bothered to call us either, despite them being there when he died.\n\nI think I was in shock. I couldn\u2019t cry. I feel numb. He was getting better. He was doing so good, and then just hours later he\u2019s dead. I probably looked stone cold that hour we spent just standing around his cold, dead body. I just stared into space and tried to feel... anything. Anything at all. \n\nI finally broke down this morning, seeing all the RIP posts all over Facebook. A man I\u2019ve never met sent me a message, giving condolences and telling me how my grandpa had saved his life when he was struggling with addiction. \n\nHe was such a good man. He struggled for years before finding his God and beating his alcoholism. He spent more years working at the same rehab he\u2019d finally recovered in, aiding so many in finding their peace and recovery as well. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine never seeing him again. Never hearing his voice again. Never getting one of his hugs again. \n\nI love you grandpa. I\u2019ll miss you forever. Rest In Peace.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

So in the summer of 2017, my father passed away due to stage IV cancer. I was the one holding his hand when he died, and my girlfriend of a year and a half was helping my mom as she went into shock. Fast forward to this year, me (21 M) and my girlfriend (21 F) were still together since then until a couple months ago where she broke it off. We were together for 3.5 years. She told me the reason for it was in the two years since my dad died I was never there for her emotionally, neglected her and that when she wanted to get physical I never wanted to. I still love and cherish this woman more than anything on this planet, but this break up hurt. When I used to have panic attacks about my dad, she would calm me down, and tell me that she would wait as long as it took for me to get better. Thats what confuses me as I felt as in the later portion of these past two years, I started to get into the acceptance phase of grief with my father, and really feeling as if I could change for the better and be the person he wanted me to be. But with this break up I\u2019ve had time to reflect and realize that I did do those things to her, put it was never purposefully or with any intent on hurting her feelings. I realized that I was depressed and anxious and suicidal but that I never expressed it. And all of those flaws and changes in character was a result in me grieving over my father.

My godmother lost her husband three years prior.\n\nHe  fell and broke his leg. He then was operated and in rehabilitation  afterwards on his way being better.  Being there he complained about  pain in his broken leg and was shushed by the personal of the clinic.  Later they found that the screw they planted in to fix the broken bones  had been come lose and was scratching on his bone. Then they moved him  to the hospital, but he already started to deteriorate, sliped in a coma  shortly after his arival and woke up only once to gestiure a kiss to  her. Because the injury was caused by a fall police was involved. When  he was cleared he was send to the morque imidiatly and my godmother  could not say goodby to the love of her life of almoust 40 years. ( We  are in germany, open cofins ar not commen and he was cremated) He was  not a healthy man, got a new kidney 10 years back and had heart problems  due to his medication so his sudden death was just kind of sudden. Also  he died just two weeks before his birthday ( allready planned and  guests had been invited) and exactly one month befor their anniversary,  making a whole month just hell for my godmother.\n\nHer  niece and I are trying to help her as best as we can. The first  year was very though and we feared we might lose her to alcohol or a  broken heart. After this she stared to get better and better. She is  still griefing for her husband, but we all know that this is normal and  takes time. In fall last year she seemed optimistic for the first time.  Taking on projects and planning on buying a dog. So on a good way, one  would think. The dog (f, labrador) is now 8 month old and living with  her since march. And she seems to be completly overwelmed with this  young energetic animal. She loves her very much and is trying to train  her but she is just not able to take controll over the dog. Her comands  are ignored 80 to 90% of the time, which can be dangerous when the dog  escapes the large garden and runs onto the street (luckyly no heavy  traffic). She went to training with the dog and got frustrated when she  was criticized by the trainer/breeder. I thought this might be, because  she doesn't work well with the breeder/trainer, because both are very  headstrong woman who had a lot to fight in their life and sometimes this  doesn't mix well. But she is really bad in taking criticism and feels  attacted whenever one is telling her when she makes a mistake. Her  niece, who is like a daughter to her, was so feed up, that she was  thinking about not showing up on this years obit. She showed up, but I  feel it is a sign how far things have gone between the two of them. I  thought that this is the part where you see how her husband is missing.  He always was calm and collected and like a rock. Even if something  happend he wasn't shocked or didn't show. He handled everything calmly  and carefully, balancing her out in a way.\n\nBut  a few days ago I was there and overheard something she told some  friends who visited her. The dog had been very exited, because she loves  people and was jumping and running around trying to get pets. My  godmother was stressed. This sunday is her husbands birthday, so we are  kind of in the middle of this hellish month. I took the dog out to play  with her a little bit and to distract her and when I came in my  godmother was crying. She was telling her guests ( very very good  friends, who allready know this story) how it came that she has no  children of her own and they tried to comfort her, telling her that she  had me and her niece and than I added: \"And you have \\[Dog\\].\" she than  scoffed and said. \"And what a dog \"I\" have. I just brought her, because  \\[husband\\] said, when I retire we do all the things we wanted to do  again, travel and making a cruise and getting a dog. He always wanted  his own labby.\" I can't get this out of my head. Let me make it clear  again. She loves that dog to pieces. But everything looks quiete  different to me after hearing this.\n\nShe  is still griefing for her husband and I thing her problems with the dog  are mirroring this. Seeing the friction it causes with her niece, which  she practicly raised, I think she is at a point where she needs  professional help to move on. The problem is, that she told me two years  ago, that she can't go to a support group, because she can't open up in  front of strangers. And a group of strangers is simply overkill for  her. So I was thinking she should be looking for a therapist, but I have  no idea how to bring this up to her without mortaly offending her. Like  I said it is this very hard time right now but I fear, when this time  passes she might not see the need in seeking help. But making this more  problematic, a few month after her husbands death, a lot of people  pushed her to be over with the grieving and moving on in life. She was  rightfully pissed, but others might have done more harm. These people  added, that if she wasn't over it after new year (her husband died in  august) she should seek out a support group, because this was not  normal. So me telling her to find a therapist to help her with the grief  is a highly emotionally charged. But I fear, moving on like this will  make her push more people away from her.\n\nDoes anyone has any advice how to handle this situation?\n\ntl;dr: Godmother is grieffing her dead husband and this is starting to affect her relationships.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I felt like someone had taken my entire world and shifted the axis just enough for everything to fall out of place\u2014it felt like someone took my fully lived in home and tilted it just far enough for everything to fall off the shelves, for the furniture to shift and fall from its place, and left me in the center of the mess of broken and displaced items. I was only nineteen at the time. While i had lost a couple of friends and some other more distant family members, it was the first truly big, profound death in my life. It changed me. \n\nI thought I knew grief. I thought that when someone else close to me died, it would hurt, but that I knew the landscape. That although it would be painful, it would be less shocking, somehow less confusing, less complicated. I was wrong. \n\nMy family lives in another state. I came home last Friday, and have been adrift. Two weeks and three days isn\u2019t that long, but it may as well have been an eternity. My friends are supportive, but there\u2019s nothing they can really do. My boyfriend was initially supportive while I was gone, but acted like a colossal ass this past weekend, so I have barely spoken to him since Sunday night. He has been slammed with work, so I have been largely left alone. He clearly expects me to do the work of facilitating a conversation to \u201cfix\u201d it, and I don\u2019t have the energy. I can\u2019t be bothered to care enough. My brother is dead, and your meetings, your small inconveniences, your excuses for being a jerk are meaningless to me. Maybe that\u2019s not fair. But neither is this situation. Neither is life. \n\nMy sleep schedule is fucked. Remembering to eat is impossible, and even when I somehow manage it, I sometimes skip a meal anyway because everything sounds terrible. I don\u2019t want anything. I just want my brother back. I want more time\u2014more time to resolve conflicts, more time to tell him I love him, more time to beg him to get help, more time to tell him he\u2019s an asshole and fight with him, because at least if we are fighting it means he\u2019s still here. \n\nSibling grief is complicated. When you lose a parent, or when a parent loses a child, or a spouse loses their partner, the impact is obvious. Undeniable. But the loss of someone you grew up with, who walked alongside you from the beginning, who was a built in comrade and collaborator, sometimes competition, sometimes more frenemy than friend, is devastating. It\u2019s a different loss than that of my dad, that\u2019s true. But it is not less. And somehow I thought it would be less. \n\nI can\u2019t stop crying, and the planet keeps spinning as if nothing happened at all. I want to scream, can\u2019t you see that everything is different? Can\u2019t you see that now nothing will be the same? \n\nPeople die every day, even people who are far better persons than my brother ever was, and the world doesn\u2019t stop for them. Why would it stop for him? This is the nature of things, and death is as natural and fundamental to living as is breathing and eating and loving. But I still want to scream.

It started with them calling my mother's ex-husband and trying to involve him in the funeral.

He donated money to my mother's funeral as his 'way to say goodbye and do the right thing' as what I know from mutual people who were friends with my father's family and friends with my mom.

She said that our mother (who is passed) put a bad taste in our mouths about our father, but maybe what we're telling her about him is true - she doesn't know.

Sometimes I wish I could read the police report.", "author": "aredditalterego", "self_text": "One of my closest friends died in a motorcycle wreck last year. I can't begin to tell you how kind-hearted, and sweet, and caring he was. I miss him every day. \n\nSome days are harder than others. The days and weeks surrounding the first anniversary of his death were like the day  he died, all over again. All I wanted to do was hide under the covers and not exist. I didn't (and don't) want to die, but I didn't want to feel that loss anymore.\n\nI know some of the things that are supposed to help with grief. A few months before my friend died, I was in a short-lived relationship with someone whose father passed away a few weeks prior, and I devoted all my down time to looking up how to help someone through grief. I know one of the things that supposedly helps is talking to other people who knew and loved the deceased, sharing your memories with them....\n\nMy friend lived in a different state. We met in person only once. That didn't matter to either of us. He was always there, on the other end of the phone, through every joy I celebrated and every struggle I ever went through, for almost ten years. But because of the distance, I can't \"share memories\" with the people who knew and loved him. I don't know those people. I met some of his friends the night I met him, and we've stayed in touch over Facebook, but we're not close, and they're *actively grieving* my friend, who they had many more years with and (no matter how close our friendship was) were even closer to. How can I possibly call them to whine about how much I miss him?\n\nThis is all a jumbled mess of thoughts. I've been meaning to post for a while now.\n\nSometimes... I want to call the police officer (their name was listed in the news report) who arrived on the scene, and ask about my friend. He never even made it to the hospital, he died on the scene. I want to know - and DON'T want to know - of what? Was it instant? Did he feel any pain? Did he know? \n\nSometimes, I want to read the police report. Is that fucked-up of me? \n\nI work for a personal injury lawyer. I see police reports almost every day. The day after my friend died, we got a new case - a motorcycle wreck, of all things. The police report had the wrong box checked, so our client was incorrectly listed as a fatality. I had a crying fit/panic attack so severe I had to run to the bathroom. When I realized the report was wrong and the client was still alive, I was so relieved. The client turned out to be a complete and utter dick. That doesn't mean he deserves anything bad to happen to him, no, but it fucked me up that a mean-spirited dick of an old man could get hit on his motorcycle and not only survive, but walk away from it richer, thanks to a nice fat lawsuit; meanwhile, my sweet, caring friend, who lived less than half the years the old man has, gets hit on his motorcycle and that's it. He's gone. Working where I do, I've seen good people with horrific, life-altering injuries get hefty financial compensation for their pain and suffering. I've also seen shitty, greedy people exaggerating minor injuries or prolonging medical treatments to drive up their costs and sue for a higher sum - and since my friend died, I *hate* them. I hate how ridiculously fucking unfair and arbitrary it is that a car/bike wreck can make you rich or it can kill you. And it killed my friend.\n\nSomething about seeing that incorrectly written report the day after my friend died, and seeing the end of someone's whole life reduced to a checkbox on a report, fucked me up. Then, realizing it was incorrect, I wished I could just White-Out the Fatalities box on my friend's police report and it would bring him back.\n\nSorry this post turned out longer than I thought it would. I don't actually want answers to my questions about my friend's final moments. I just want to know... why do I want to read the police report? Why do I want to contact the police officer? Has anyone done this? Does it actually help?\n\nThanks for reading.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My dad has undergone two heart surgeries. His kidneys are failing now. He can no longer breathe without oxygen, and he cannot control his bowels. My mom has been taking care of him, but she's older and can't do it anymore. When he's released from the hospital he's going to hospice this time.

I've never had a family member who was dying, only a family member who died suddenly (only my grandmother).

{"post_id": "cuhnhk", "created_utc": 1566584014, "title": "The decimation of a family", "author": "parkertl", "self_text": "Hi Guys, Im looking for some help and Im hoping that I can distill my experience in a \u2018reasonable\u2019 post. \nI grew up with a bipolar mother, she battled bouts of mania and anger for my entire childhood. My brother and I never really knew what person we were going to come home from school to. 90% of the time she would be a very loving and generous person, and the remaining 10% she would become enraged because a sock was on the floor. It causes you to never fully trust anyone.\nIn 2012 my brother and his fianc\u00e9 were involved in a horrible boating accident where a man lost his life and a lady was horribly and permanently injured. This was the beginning of the worst season of life I could ever imagine.\nThe case dragged on in the courts for over 6 years. During that time the stress of it sent my mother deeper into a Bipolar abyss. A little over two years ago it turned into full blown paranoia. She was constantly attacking my father, blaming him for every little made-up thing she felt wrong in her life. Eventually in July 2017 she fell into a manic state and began calling everyone telling them my father was stalking her. It got to the point that I had to drive to her house about 3 hours away and ultimately have her committed via what they call a 1013 in Georgia. I had to ride with her in the back of a police car to the hospital because she refused to ride in the ambulance. She was in a treatment facility for over about 2 weeks.\n\nAfter she left the facility she had agreed to see a therapist who was the head of psychology at the local medical school. A person that, on paper, was as qualified as you would want. My Dad took her to her first appointment and she put on a show as we would call it. Blaming everything on Dad. It was apparently so convincing that he told her she didn\u2019t need to be on the meds that had been prescribed. She immediately went home and flushed them all down the toilet.\nI wrote the doctor a very long email explaining the situation giving him the completely picture from the family\u2019s perspective, near the end of my note I wrote:\n\n\u201cWe talked to my father after the appointment at your office today. He is completely and utterly crushed and feels totally helpless and I am honestly deeply concerned for his well being. I have never heard him this sorrowful and dejected and that is saying quite a bit given what he has been through for the past several months. She has flushed all of her medication down the toilet; we feel like we have been set back to the very beginning of this whole thing.\u201d\n\nAfter much back and forth he agreed to an appointment with our whole family in two days. My, Dad, my Brother and me.\nWe arrived and, despite her gaslighting, he diagnosed her as Bipolar Hypomanic and provided her meds with a plan to monitor their effectiveness through bloodtests, but she was compliant for only a few days. At this point she became even worse. She stepped up her attacks on my Dad, she was making his life miserable. He lost so much weight, wasn\u2019t sleeping, but refused to leave her side for longer than a couple of days. She finally served him with divorce papers on 9/22/17 (they had been married for over 40 years), Dad was dejected but my brother and I vowed to do everything in our power to continue to get things right because we knew she was only trying to hurt him. \n\nOn the morning of 9/25 my father killed himself in the backyard of their home. My Dad was the sweetest, most loving and most gentle person I will ever know. He loved my mom unconditionally to the moment he pulled the trigger. He just lost all hope of things ever getting better.\n\nThat very next day my brother was checked into a hospital and was diagnosed with MRSA. He would remain in the hospital for several weeks while I worked to plan Dad\u2019s services.\nDuring one of my trips to their home I arranged for an appointment with Mom and her \u2018Pshychotherapist\u2019. I wanted to make sure Mom was receiving the appropriate treatment. It was during this meeting that this doctor proceeded to tell me that my Dad killed himself because he couldn\u2019t handle the thought of living without my Mom and that he had driven her away by not being affectionate or communicating enough. He said that in these situations he always recommends that people go home and read the Bible. Needless to say, I had my answer, she was not getting treated for what she suffered from.\n\nMoving ahead several weeks, my brother was finally released from the hospital and we had Dad\u2019s services. I eulogized him twice. I still really miss him.\n\nFor a time my brother and I would support each other, with the help of family and friends. In July of the next year, my brother\u2019s boat accident case was finally settled. He submitted an Alford plea whereby he would accept 1 year of house arrest and probation while maintaining innocence. He was really struggling at this time, we were both still reeling from the loss of Dad and honestly didn\u2019t know what dealing with grief truly meant, he was drinking and displaying self destructive tendencies. I would communicate with him to tell him that we needed to really get him help and that the time will pass quickly. The night of 10/15/18 he and his wife (who happens to be a very good friend of my then girlfriend/partner) had a fight, she slept downstairs and my brother took multiple different drugs from benedryl to 3-4 benzodiazepines and anti-depressants. He died of an overdose at some point the morning of 10/16. My sister in law called me at 6 am to tell me she had been performing CPR and he was cold. My girlfriend and I rushed up there, about halfway she got a call tell her that my brother had been pronounced dead. I got there in time to say goodbye and watched them wheel him into the coroner van. I still have a hard time expressing the devastation I felt. I started to call different people to tell them what had happened. \n\nI called my aunt (my mother\u2019s sister in law), there was a really unsual pause in the conversation after I told her. She said to me, \u2018I need to tell you something, a week ago your mother attempted suicide at home. She took a bunch of Xanax and when that didn\u2019t work she cut open both arteries in her arms. She has been in a facility since being released from the hospital. We promised her we wouldn\u2019t tell you guys until she had completed treatment and was home\u2019 So within a matter of hours I had found out that my brother had died (I feel like intentionally or apathetically, despite the coroner report) and my mother had tried to and my brother, I guess fortunately, never knew. I had to go to her mental health facility and tell her that her youngest son had died.\n\nMom was released from the facility about a week later. She went right back into a Bipolar mania. She was breaking things around the house, tearing up my photos, blaming everyone for the death or her son. I was trying to plan my brother\u2019s funeral with the threat of my mother blowing the entire thing up. She was calling and threatening anyone she could think of, to the point that several of our close family friends said that they weren\u2019t going to be able to make it to his funeral. We even had to hire police at the funeral home. I spoke with her on 10/30, 3 days prior to the services, in an attempt to get her to snap back to reality and see if she would be able to be ok at the service (this was the last time I communicated with my mother). The very next day, she called the police and told them she had a prowler. When they arrived they found my mother holed up in her attic. When she came down she assaulted the police officers by discharging a fire extinguisher in their face. They ultimately took her into custody and she was again 1013\u2019d. This time they continued to extend her stay as much as possible, through 3 different facilities, because she was clearly unstable. She missed my brother\u2019s funeral and was finally released in early December when a judge ruled that she was competent to go home, despite the recommendation of every doctor and caregiver. She went home and my only updates are from people that see her around town, she wont talk to any family.  A good friend helped me plan the service, I eulogized my little brother.\n\nMy brother and I shared several friends. There was one in particular that he was very close to, a friend I went to high school and college with and we were roommates for going on 10 years after college. A few years ago he had developed a mysterious medical condition that caused him severe intestinal pain amongst other things. He would be ok for a few months but then would be effectively sidelined for weeks. He had moved to his parents\u2019 home for a time until he was actually doing much better, buying a home, connecting with old high school friends, being his normal hilarious self. He was devastated by my brother\u2019s death. We were in contact fairly regularly (he lived a solid hour away from me so it was primarily by text). On 5/6/19 I got a call from him, I was on a conference call and wasn\u2019t able to answer, so I texted him to let him know that. A few minutes later I got a message from another high school friend, my friend had killed himself in his backyard. Along with several of his other close friends, I eulogized my friend of 28 years.\n\nSo within the span of 22 months, I had to have my mother committed (for the first of many times) and my father, my brother and my dear friend all killed themselves (whether or not you feel like my brother was intentional/apathetic, he still did it himself).\n\nFinally, I have been with my current girlfriend for over 7 years. We have seen and done so much together, we were really good partners in life. Just the other night we sit down to dinner and she tells me basically that my grieving process has precluded her from having the fun and excitement she craves in her life. That she had been considering asking for an open relationship since shortly after my brother died. She told me that she puts a premium on looking forward to the unknown and that the depth we had created in all of our life experiences together were not that compelling, so what do I think we need to do about it. I know this is going to come across as defensive, but I was always very aware that I needed to make sure that I didn\u2019t crawl into a ball and become an unfeeling mass of flesh, but it was a struggle to enjoy things for a while there.  We made time to do things we enjoy and continue to be connected.\n\nSo, now, I don\u2019t know what is going to happen. I don\u2019t have an immediate family and the person I had built a really deep  connection with through shared experience and I thought would fill that role, now says they might not want to be in a relationship. \n\nIm fortunate my professional life is going well, so I try to focus there, but its hard to be productive when the slow destruction of your personal life is nearly complete.\n\nThank you for reading this.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

At the beginning of May she had to go into a nursing home/ rehab facility to await a back procedure. She was supposed to be there for a week and a half, but long story short she died of pneumonia three and half weeks later. I had taken off time from work to visit her when she first went in. I was always taking time off work to help her. She first told me she had pneumonia about a week and a half after her admittance. Here is where I feel guilty. My brother and I had come up with a shared responsibilty plan sort of thing. I have always been the legs on the ground because I live closer, which sometimes I resented. So he said he would do all the calls etc with the doctors and nursing staff, and I would take time off work and go up as needed. I took what mom told me about the pneumonia to him, he said he would talk to them. They denied she had it. In fact they lied about a lot of things, and I am not entirely sure what to do about that either. They told us her cancer had spread (later scans showed her tumors were shrinking), she had dementia etc. As she got sicker she was very inchoerent, and I just took what my brother was saying (from their mouths) at face value. Though sometimes I felt like something wasn't right. By the time we both figured out what was happening it was too late. We had her transferred to a real hospital, but they couldn't save her. I keep thinking \"why didn't I go back up even a week earlier?\", and the honest truth was that I was tired. I had been going back and forth for three years, and on the phone with my mother everyday. I loved my mother, I did it all willingly, but at this point I had just gone up and was tired. I feel like i messed up the time it really counted, and I know my mother wouldn't hold it against me, but something inside of me feels so badly that i need her forgiveness.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Logically this makes no sense since there is no guarantee the treatments would work even if he ate the number of calories he needed to eat and food made him feel sick so all it could have done was made him miserable\n\nI am angry at the doctors that convinces him to agree to the DNR. Again, logically it made sense. The tumor reached his brain. He was living on borrowed time and resuscitating would have just prolonged things. But just 2 days before he agreed to the DNR he told his drs he was going to keep fighting. Just 1 days before he told them he wanted to do what needed to be done to keep breathing, that he was really interested in living. That day, even though it was logical, they broke what spirit he had. \n\nI am angry at myself because i still remember my mother fighting with him to eat. I had spent so long trying to help her and when things got bad i finally told her that there was a point where she needed to accept that if he didnt want to eat that he would be the one to suffer the consequences of not doing what he needed to do and she needed to give herself a break and not make their time together miserable. Wtf was i thinking. I am angry i was so cold. Yes he suffered the consequences. So did we. \n\nI come back to being angry at my deceased father because he quit. He just quit. Whats worse is he quit out of depression. Out of hopelessness. Out of a broken heart and spirit. He didnt reach a point where he realized he was ready. He wasnt ready, no matter how many times i try to say he was, that he made choices, i say these to make me feel better but they arent true. He wasnt ready he was trapped. He wasnt at peace he was terrified. He didnt accept the result, he quit so he couldnt fail. \n\nSo now im just....angry...", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Both my SO and child we present, though my kid got sent home (we live across the street) when my SO felt something was wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, the issue we're having is finding others to grieve with.

I feel like when she died the last 16 years of my life disappeared, like my life before her and after her were just stitched together. I am worried that it won't come back, that she will be gone from my memory forever, that my life will go on not just without her, but without a trace of her. Even things like looking at her picture don't really effect me most of the time.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? I'm not worried about \"grieving the right way\", but not having memories that are meaningful (or being able to connect meaning to memories) is awful. The idea that I could just move on without an emotional connection is horrifying.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I've had losses with death and with other areas of my life and I am getting to point where I am not sure I can take it anymore. I am not trying to be a snowflake on here where I think things and opportunities should just be handed to me. I know how to work hard to get what I want but my luck seems to be running out. I will give you the rundown. \n\nI've posted here before. I lost my Dad over 8 years ago to stomach cancer when I was 27, he was 65. Out of the blue it came and got him, we had 5 months left on this earth together and I think about it every single day. My Mom never got over it and right after my Dad's death she became ill herself and has been suffering with COPD from years of smoking. I am thankful she doesn't have cancer, but watching her get worse and become this old lady before my eyes has been quite a number of grieving moments in and of itself. I went through many of the stages of grief and I still go through them to this day, but one of the stages has never left me and that is anger. Anger seems to be a new friend of mine I carry with me in all aspects of my life from personal to work and I cannot seem to shake it. I am angry cancer took my Dad. I am angry my Mom decided to cope with his death by smoking herself to almost death and now burdening me with taking care of her and her affairs. She has been hospitalized 6 times since 2012 and the last two she came extremely close to dying. I put boundaries between us, but I still have a sense of guilt. I should mention I am an only child.\n\nAnother loss. We are coming to this time of selling my childhood home, which I have had an odd relationship with since my Dad's passing. At first, I couldn't stand to be there. It was not a familiar place anymore. Then through the grief it became a refuge. And finally, two years ago it became a place my Mom could no longer live in for her health and safety. And here we are the final stop on this part of the journey of cleaning out 35+ years of memories and the thought of someone else living there makes me sick to my stomach.\n\nAnother loss. Myself. Me. Who am I? As I get older meeting people is harder. Friends or even boyfriends. It seems as I age I have less friends by way of falling outs, logistics, or just organic means to no one's fault. I know that some of this is life but it is magnified by the losses I have experienced. Some people say to me, \"You have gone through a lot for someone your age.\" And you know what? That actually makes me feel even worse. I am 35 and I was hoping by this age I would be married with at least a kid or two and I am not. I am single as ever. I see my friends getting married and now starting to have children and I am just lagging behind them. I am standing on the pier while they all sail into the sunset. The day will come when I will be phased out because I will be the middle aged Auntie who gets invited of pity not because I have a 3 year old their kid can play with while we sit over on the side drinking wine or whatever. When I hear good news for people I know I pretend to be happy for them. I can't genuinely be happy for them because I am not happy for myself. And how shitty of a thing is that to say? It makes me shitty to behave in such a manner, but after being beat down one loss after another it's hard to be happy for anyone. Some may say I am jealous, and that is fine if you want to label it that, but I bring it back to the anger thing.\n\nWhen will I start gaining? Because, as I stated in the beginning, I am not sure I can take this anymore. I am dying on the inside. I'm dying on the inside and no one knows.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Bernie Sanders is on, and I'm annoyed, because I made the mistake of reading a few of the comments, and oh my fuck.\n\n10 hours ago. Arrive at Mom's. She happens to call, how about that, and husband answers, and tells her we're pulling into the driveway.\n\n9 hours ago. I mention I'm going to pick up lunch. Mom wants a chef salad and two bottles of ginger ale; we're skeptical about the latter, so husband checks to see how much is in the house. The answer is: plenty. The home health aid gives us a twenty, asks us to pick up a few things for her. We head out.\n\n8 and a half hours ago. I ask Mom if she wants raspberry vinaigrette on her salad. I adjust her hospice bed, so she can sit up and eat. Husband puts son's food in the microwave.\n\n8 hours ago. Mom coughs. A cluster of nerves blossom in my stomach. She says she's fine. She asks for a knife.\n\n7 hours and 45 minutes ago. She coughs again. And again. She's not really eating. There's fluid, very obviously fluid. The aid gives her medicine. \n\n7 hours and 30 minutes ago. She asks for something to spit into. She's coughing up phlegm; this is normal for her, but there's something, in the back of my head, and in the pit of my stomach. \n\n7 hours and 20 minutes ago. She's asking for help, but what can we do? She has a DNI, and she's on hospice, so it's not like we can call someone and have them suck the fluid out. She says she can't breathe. She's removed her oxygen, so I get it re-secured and instruct her to take deep breaths through her nose, and husband starts coaching her through coughing, and that feeling is getting stronger. He and the aid are telling me it'll be fine. They've seen this before. She just needs to get the air back into her lungs, and to calm down a bit, and she'll be fine.\n\nI look at my husband and say, \"I've got a really bad feeling about this.\"\n\n7 hours and 15 minutes ago. It's harder to get her to answer us. \"Can you see us?\" \"Yes.\" \"Are you in pain?\" \"Yes.\" \"Where?\"\n\nShe responds, whimpering, \"I don't know!\"\n\nFluid, again. Keep coughing, keep coughing. Breathe through your nose.\n\n7 hours and 10 minutes ago. Her eyes are unfocused and starting to roll back.\n\nI know it. I know it, in my gut. I've known it for at least half an hour. I've fucking known it, but I've told myself no, no, no, I'm catastrophizing.\n\n7 hours ago. She makes this awful gurgling sound. There's froth coming out of her mouth. I'm near her head, so, at first, I check for her pulse in her neck. What I feel is a convulsion. More froth comes out.\n\nI know it. I know what's happening.\n\nHusband's come up, and the aid's coming, and I run around to the opposite side of the hospice bed, and I take her wrist, and I check for a pulse there. I feel a beat -- but then, the pause is so long before the next, and the next is fainter, and then there isn't a third, and I think, \"no no no I'm mistaken,\" and I dig my fingers into her wrist, and wait, and there's nothing. My husband wipes her mouth. There's a pulse oximeter on the coffee table; I grab it, and stick it on her finger. It's not picking up anything.\n\nI take it off. I pace. Husband grabs me. \"Hey,\" he says, \"take a deep breath.\" He places a hand on her chest. He says he can feel something. \n\nThe aid touches Mom's legs. \"She's cold.\"\n\nHusband: \"I'll turn the air conditioner down.\"\n\nI try to find Mom's pulse again. The aid asks me if I'm getting anything.\n\n\"I can't find it.\"\n\nThe aid starts trying to rouse her. I put the oximeter back on her finger, and the aid tells me to put it on her thumb.\n\nNothing. Nothing. The meter rises and falls, searching, failing. \n\nIn my gut, already, I know. I know.\n\nMom's color is draining and the aid can't find a pulse, either. \"I think she's going,\" the aid says. And then, \"I think she's left.\"\n\n6 hours and 55 minutes ago. Backing away from the hospice bed. Crying out, falling to the floor. The aid grabbing me, hugging me, telling me she's resting. \n\nThere is no preparation for this. There is nothing that...there is nothing. Years and years and years, and still, the moment comes, and there is shock. 15 years ago, she went to the hospital, and my father called me at college and told me he didn't think she was going to make it. It's been 2 years since he died, and since we started really fearing she'd go at any time.\n\nAnd yet... Granted, I didn't expect it would be quite this way. I didn't think I'd see it, I didn't think it would be so strangely violent. I didn't think I'd feel her final heartbeats. \n\n4 hours and 35 minutes ago. Two close family friends, at the house. Employees of the funeral home at the door. My mother in a red body bag (they've tried to make it not look like a body bag, but that's what the fuck it is, come on). \n\nPeople are informed. They're passing on the news. I've made a list of things that need to be done. It's not the first time I've planned arrangements, but this time around, I'm going to have to sell a house. My son will not grow up spending time here.\n\nMy son will forget his grandparents. \n\n2 hours ago, he asks where grandma is. \n\nShe was alive 8 hours ago. She was alive. 10 hours ago she asked me how I was. I told her I was tired, and she said she was sorry. \"I don't like that you're tired.\" \"Eh, everyone's tired.\" \"Not me!\"\n\n7 and a half hours, struggling, but still alive. 7 hours, dead.\n\nA difference of 3 hours.\n\nHere I am, in an old house, with an empty, deflated bed in the living room, on a computer that I bought for my father, who is also dead.\n\nIt's all ending, now.

There are digital casino and card games from 1996. There's Compton's Interactive Encyclopedia, from 1995.

Both my parents died within 25 months, my Dad in February 2017 and my mom in March. I was adopted at a very young age, 6 months, and they raised me instead of my biological mom, who is one of their kids. My Dad and I had a very close relationship until I was 23 and moved into an apartment with my girlfriend (now my wife). My parents took my leaving hard and often said that I chose her and her family over them. Which isn't so, but it was really hard not to take that to heart at the time. Since then, I called them out on it and they assured me that they loved my now wife and never felt that way. All this is making a point, I promise. Anyways, my first week of the second semester of graduate school, which was in 2011, my Dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, my Mom was his primary care giver. He didn't really progress heavily till another 2 years. Since then I've gotten married, graduated college and started a full time job, which I'm still st. However, all of those have left me empty inside since and part of that is depression. Both of my folks were in their 60s at this point. I have four older siblings who are at least 18 years older than me, two of my sisters and one of my brothers lived near them and the other brother lives near me. This is already a long story but I feel like I lost myself in my relationship and wasn't there for my Dad and Mom like I felt I should be. In the last few years, I realized my wife and I are extremely codependent and I was honestly unhappy the last few years of our relationship while my Dad's health declined. My mom was never one to ask for help and I thought things were okay and she didn't need me, while I was trying to build a career and fix my marriage, he died and then 2 years later, my Mom died unexpectedly. I feel like such an ungrateful child, they sacrificed everything for me to grow up and go to college and be successful and I feel like I abandoned them. Now I look at my wife and feel such resentment, like I chose her over them. To the naked eye, this is ridiculous, but this is how I feel right now. I had something special with my folks that I will never have again, and I think it's part of the reason some of my siblings resent me and have shamed me for not being there enough for my folks. Between my parents dying, my mother in law died unexpectedly, so my wife is dealing as well. All of this has put a damper on a relationship that hasn't been good for awhile. We are both trying to be good for each other and it feels incredibly lonely. I just wish my Mom and my Dad were to help me navigate all of this. I feel so utterly alone, scared, and frightened. I'm 32 years old and have no idea how to parent myself. Thanks to those who read this. Please be kind, grief, complicated grief especially, is a fucked up mix bag, and I just needed to get this out to someone before I isolate myself even further.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

And as their mom I\u2019ve been consoling my 3 kids (12, 9, 6 1/2) all day and I need to tell someone out there how much pain I feel too. I had to make the decision to put down my 12 year old dog (cancer) years ago and it was devastating, but this pain is much worse since it\u2019s unexpected. She just turned 5 and she was the best dog I ever had, she was the first dog that was \u201cmine\u201d- she knew I was her mommy and followed me everywhere and loved me the most. My kids cherished her, she cuddled with them all day and was the sweetest 8 lb dog you ever met. When my last dog died, I didn\u2019t think any dog could ever be better for me, but somehow this foster dog ended up being my family\u2019s best friend. \n\nShe was outside relaxing in her chair while we got ready to celebrate my daughter\u2019s birthday and I couldn\u2019t find her. I thought maybe the gardener left gate open, so my husband went outside to look and found her floating in the deep end of the pool and yelled for me. I was able to keep kids inside so they didn\u2019t see too. I checked my cameras and she had drowned 20 mins before. The gardener was in the backyard at the time, he didn\u2019t even notice. She was near the deep end and was looking in another direction, one foot misplaced and she tipped into pool. She panicked and forgot where to get out. She\u2019s 8lb so she couldn\u2019t just lift herself out in deep end. She didn\u2019t bark. It was quick. I don\u2019t know why I watched the video, but somehow I felt better- like she wasn\u2019t begging for help and ignored. No one could have saved her. It was just a tragic accident and it gave me some comfort. I\u2019m not mad or angry. \n\nMy heart is broken though. I always thought she would die of old age, not by drowning. She didn\u2019t deserve this. She was so innocent and loving. I wish it wasn\u2019t this way. And I can\u2019t take the pain away, my kids are hurting, she was their best friend. I can\u2019t make it better. I feel bad that it was on my kid\u2019s birthday too, we didn\u2019t celebrate at all and they cried for most of the last 9 hours until they fell asleep.   \n\nI\u2019ve lost my father to suicide so I know time heals all wounds, but for some reason that doesn\u2019t help me today and seeing my kids cry.

We were waiting on a new heart for her, but after a stroke and bleeding to the brain, there was nothing that could be done. We all got to mourn her the best way you can with lots of crying, time to tell her that we loved her though we weren\u2019t sure she could hear us, and we held her hand as she passed away at about 9 AM after late rites were performed. \n\nI don\u2019t know if she knew she was dying. One day, the doctor was putting her on the critical list and she was giving him the thumbs up. The next she was dead. I know there were times where she knew she could die, but I don\u2019t think she was ready. I wonder if she was scared that afternoon that she fell unconscious. I stayed with her until 12 that afternoon until I had to go to therapy. I spent the evening with someone until midnight. On my way home, my father called me frantically saying we needed to go to the hospital and I already suspected it was the end. \n\nI wish I hadn\u2019t left that day. I wish I wasn\u2019t with some stupid boy that night. At the very least, I wish I had left therapy and gone to see her again. It wouldn\u2019t have done anything but I just wish. \n\nAnd I\u2019m having these flashes of her last few months. How in September I was student teaching and sleeping 3 hours a night as I struggled. There were many times I denied her, \u201cMom, I can\u2019t I have to finish this lesson plan.\u201d What a stupid excuse especially because I couldn\u2019t stick it out anyways. I ended up mental and in a psych ward. We had to cancel our trip to her sister\u2019s. That could\u2019ve been the last time she went up to Vermont. Lord knows she missed opportunities to go up for a whole year because I was working or she was sick. Instead, she was visiting me in the loony bin.\n\nThen I have flashes of all the times she wanted me to eat. I don\u2019t know what happened in August, but I was at a BBQ for work and it just started with taking only some chicken, veggies, and denying myself the cookie. Didn\u2019t think much of it, just seemed like the healthy choice. I only ate at most 500 calories a day after that. \n\nAnd I kept lying to her about eating dinner or \u201cI had a big lunch\u201d, \u201cI ate at home\u201d. She knew something was wrong. I dropped 25 lbs by January. She was in shock. She was proud, but always warned about Karen Carpenter and how I needed to be careful. I specifically remember this one time in September when she was in the hospital. She was eating peanut M&amp;Ms\u2014her favorite. She asked if I wanted any and of course I said no. But now all I can think is that every time I said no to a handful of M&amp;Ms I was saying no to her, to being with her. \n\nI remember when she got some candy for Christmas and we had to sneak it to her because the hospital was strict about her diet. I tried to let her have a little of each kind, but my dad cut her off. \u201cWhat are sweet twists?\u201d I remember her asking as I pulled the box away. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna get her in trouble,\u201d Dad said. \u201cWhat are sweet twists?\u201d she yelled. \n\nMom, I never ate those sweet twists, even when I started binge eating after you died, because you never got one. \n\nThese flashes keep playing over and over again in my mind along with memories from before all this. Mom bought these exercise tapes when I was in high school and it came with a stupid thing called a wave board. She looked silly trying to balance on it, but it was the last time I remember her being that mobile. And she was laughing. \n\nI keep seeing the quiet concern she always held in her eyes when she looked at me. I keep hearing her laugh\u2014how it came out in little chuckles or big ferocious ones so strong a sound barely came out. I remember her eye rolls and the \u201care you fucking kidding me?\u201d face, the tone she\u2019d take when we were all being \u201ctoo stupid to function\u201d. She wanted things her way. She was feisty. Being sick took that out of her. In her final week, she cried, just wanting to quit work and be taken care of for once instead of worrying about everyone else. And I wanted to make that happen if it meant working myself to exhaustion again. \n\nHere I am\u2014without her. There\u2019s no one to help take a bath or change a dressing. There\u2019s no one to flush an IV for or charge a battery for a device. There\u2019s no one when things get tough and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do, there\u2019s no one to watch Hallmark Christmas movies, there\u2019s no one to tell me they love me when I cry. \n\nThere\u2019s no Mom.

It was 14 minutes until my alarm was supposed to go off, and having gone to sleep at 5 AM, I was desperate for every last minute of sleep. I pulled on my clothes and peeked through the curtains as I approached my door. I saw the unmistakable uniform of a state trooper. \n\nThey asked for my mother when I opened the door. She lived upstairs in a separate apartment from mine and I was concerned. Three weeks prior she\u2019d gotten a speeding ticket for rushing me to the hospital, which the responding officer had promised to drop if she\u2019d shown up with my discharge papers. She had, but I\u2019d thought maybe there was some miscommunication. \n\nI asked why they were there; they wouldn\u2019t tell me. They asked for her again. I said I didn\u2019t know if she was home, but that I would check. She wasn\u2019t, but her husband was. I trailed him back down to where the officers were waiting. \n\nThey asked him if my brother lived there. He said yes. They held out a picture and asked if it was my brother. He said yes. I thought maybe my brother was in trouble, or that he\u2019d done something. But then they said it. \n\nI don\u2019t remember the exact wording now. It\u2019s all a bit of a blur.

I remember sobbing \u201cno\u201d and maybe \u201cplease\u201d. I remember my stepfather explaining that I was his sister. I remember how stoic the cop looked. \n\nMy mom had been on her way home during this conversation, and when she arrived and they told her, she screamed. I imagine the whole neighborhood heard her. \n\nThe officer assigned to the crash could only tell us that it was an ongoing investigation. We gained the most information from the coroner, the tow company, and the news websites. \n\nWe gathered that my brother had been a passenger, with his girlfriend driving his car. We don\u2019t know where they were going. They were on a narrow, dark rode and were eastbound on a curving hill when, at 4:30 AM, my brothers car crossed the centerline and smashed head-on into an oncoming car. \n\nMy brother and his girlfriend died on scene, according to the news. Another site stated that a third car hit them shortly after the crash, and that my brother and his girlfriend \u201clater died\u201d of their injuries. I think that means that he suffered. \n\nWe have a meeting with the funeral home tomorrow. My mom is heartbroken and devastated. None of us expected to have to make arrangements and bury a 20 year old. He and his girlfriend\u2019s dog just lays on our deck and waits for them to come home. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t know how to cope with this. I don\u2019t know how to come back from it. I have no desire to finish this last semester of college, no desire to move an hour away from my mom now even though I have to, no desire to shower or eat or do anything but drink and cry. \n\nI keep thinking that if only I\u2019d stopped longer to talk to him, maybe they wouldn\u2019t have ever encountered that car. \n\nEveryone keeps telling me to let them know if they can do anything for me. But they can\u2019t. They can\u2019t bring him back. Neither can I. That\u2019s the worst part.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I have friends and family that know my other account.\n\nIt's been over 70 days since I lost my Dad. I've been pushing through everything, trying to be the stability for my Mom and my younger brother. It's hard because I live a distance away. My brother's coping mechanism is to frantically run from one \"busy\" thing to another; I'm worried about him but there's not much I can do but to reach out. He doesn't answer (too busy) but there are family members watching out for him. My Mom hasn't had much chance to grieve yet. I never realized that a constant barrage of well-meaning people tends to put everything on hold for the bereaved. She's had very little time to herself since he passed, and it's starting to wear on her. She doesn't want to say anything that may hurt friends and family that are constantly stopping by; she understands they're hurting, too. It's a frustrating situation.\n\nI am having a harder time coping with this than I thought I would have. I find myself staying up very late at night, just so I can silently cry and not disturb or upset my husband (not that he would be angry; he would just feel helpless.)\n\nI feel guilty immediately after smiling or laughing, because how *could* I. My Dad is gone. \n\nAs time passes, I feel more and more anxious. I kept my loss to myself, telling only a few people. After surviving the first wave of \"I'm sorry for your loss\"es, I've been able to process things a little more completely and have occasions where I feel absolutely overwhelmed with grief. But the time for mourning has passed. People wouldn't understand, and I don't want to talk to anyone about something so profound. I don't want to feel, and yet I do. People tell me I should be happy for him, because he's in a better place, which I find to be ludicrous because with his family is where he's supposed to be. They tell me that grief is just feeling sorry for myself, because I miss him. That strikes me as a rather cruel thing to say, and a very shallow way of looking at things.\n\nI want to cherish my memories of him. I desperately do. The moment I try to think of happier times, the shock of the entire process of arrangements, notifications, phone calls, letters and the sheer physicality of his dying hit me as though it happened a half hour ago. So I guess I'm not ready for even memories yet.\n\nThis is exhausting. Pretending to be fine, continuing with work and life as normal. I am slow to process this. Slow to find my feet. I have to help my family, so I press onward.\n\nI guess I'm trying this out to see if it helps at all. I can't see myself going to some sort of grief counselor; I can't speak of this to friends and family, and the idea of talking to a stranger about such an intimate event in my life is horrifying. This sub is about as close as I can get.\n\nThank you for letting me talk.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I never had lost anyone, especially not someone in my household. I was the youngest of 3, I have an older sister, he was the oldest. I can write for hours on how my life changed after this, how my mom shut down for years, my dad was our glue that held us together.

I lost my two main roll models on how to be a man. I don\u2019t want to blame my issues in life now on this completely but I feel it had a huge huge impact on my over passiveness and my let nothing in life bother me attitude.

Seeing a happy kid with their parents would usually do it.  Then less and less.\n\nI'm back in it right now. It hurts. It's not been letting up for a while now, tough. I know it will get better, but for the moment, I think it will help me to write about it. \n\nThank you for this space.\n\nA week ago I was playing a video game with a friend, and a terrible turd named Todd was introduced in the game. She made a joke about how all Todds are terrible, and I ended up recounting an anecdote about what it's like to grow up with that name in Germany. The German word for death is Tod. \"Class, meet your new school mate, Death\". I was always terribly embarrassed by it, and that experience was not something I would want my child to go through. \n\nAnd then it hit me that if my daughter was still alive she would have gone through pretty much the same exact experience, because her mom named her Isis. This what might have is, I think, when it started. \n\nI'm thinking about the profound positive impact she had on me. My parents weren't great role models. I didn't grow up with a template for love, not a healthy kind, and I knew that. I didn't know if I could be a good dad. I wanted kids then, but I was afraid that I was just going to end up passing down my issues. The largest part of me had therefore decided not to have kids. \n\nWhen I found out that I had a daughter, almost a year after she was born, something incredible happened that changed my life forever. Instant unconditional love just struck me. Like a lightning strike, out of nowhere. I wanted to do anything, was willing to sacrifice anything, to someone more important than myself, and it was there happiest moment of my life. It still is. \n\nThe capacity for love I have today, it's only because she came into my life and kicked open a locked door inside of me with such force that it fucking shattered.

I was greeted by my two roommates at the top of the stairs telling me that I needed to sit down and they had to talk to me. Then came the news that my baby wasn\u2019t with us anymore. They left the door open after I had left for work and my blind pug wandered outside without any supervision, and she got hit... and she laid there.

I moved out of that house the day after. \n\nAlmost a month has gone by and I\u2019m still a wreck. She was my reason to live, she gave me a reason to get up in the morning. She was always there for me during the tough times to give me snuggles. She was always there to put a smile on my face. I lost that. I lost the biggest part of me.

Dealing with her illness, death and handling her affairs afterwards, pretty much with no help from my sister, was absolutely draining. It was the hardest, scariest, most stressful and emotional time of my life. Shortly before she passed away my grandmother (who is like a second mother to me) fell and broke her hip. She recovered, but has to stay in assisted living because of mobility issues.\n\nA month after my mom passed, my sister (only sibling) got very sick and had to have surgery and she and her children had to be cared for, for a few weeks. Another very scary and stressful time. A few months after getting through the first holidays without my mom and grandma, my aunt had a major stroke. Thankfully, she was treated in time and made a full recovery.\n\nDuring that time, I found a lump in my breast and was completely terrified and just shut down. I just stayed in bed for about 2 weeks and just cried. I'm so grateful that it turned out to be a benign cyst. I went in to have an exam and the doctor felt a large cyst on one of my ovaries, so he sent me sobbing and crying to get an ultrasound done. I had a tennis ball sized cyst on each ovary that had to be surgically removed. Great. My first surgery, after all of the back to back extremely stressful crap I had just gone through, and dealing with all of this without my mom here felt impossible. My surgery was in February and went fine. I started feeling really \"out of it\" and had bloodwork, an MRI and saw countless doctors and all of them came to the conclusion that stress and anxiety were causing me to feel the way I was. Going through that year and a half of taking care of my dying mother, her death, and then all of the major events that happened in a span of 4 months had taken its toll on me. I had a complete nervous breakdown. Constant anxiety and dissociation.\n\n Fast forward to early 2018 and I was still losing hair that doctors assured me was from stress. I saw a hair restoration specialist and he diagnosed me with a progressive alopecia. I spent that year in bed frought with anxiety and depression over that. Come to find out, my hormones had been out of whack for a year and my doctor never even told me. He assured me everything was fine when I called to check. It's destroying me. I lost my grandmother early this year, and my dog, my constant companion, died 2 weeks ago. Meds and therapy only help so much. I can't stand grieving my loved ones and now I'm grieving the loss of myself every single day. I can't heal. I literally spend every day in bed or on my couch anxious and crying.

I lost my mom 5 months ago to a serious illness. She was sick and then became handicapped and then sicker on and off for the past decade of my life. I'm 36 years old, and my mom died at 70. I know she wasn't young (as one @ssh0le coworker pointed out when telling me she's \"sorry\"), but I feel robbed of having her for another 10 or 20 years. My grandma lived to be 93. My husband and I helped my dad take care of my mom for the past 5 or so years. It was rough. She was my best friend. I married the love of my life, but my mom was my soulmate. I don't know how else to put it. We talked every single day about everything.\n\nAnyway, that's the backstory. I'm doing okay. I mean, I'm not, but I'm functioning and exercising and hanging out with my husband and friends. I have good days and bad days. The thing is, I want to leave my job, and I'm wondering if I'm being rational.\n\nI have a long commute. 40-45 minutes in bumper-to-bumper traffic. I hate it. I used to call my mom on my way home and ask about her day and plan what we'd have for dinner. I used to tell her about my crappy passive aggressive coworkers and union drama and all of that. I can't do that anymore. I sit and look at my phone on my same desk, in that same place, and everything is the same except she's gone.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being impulsive, but I've wanted to leave my job for a while. I used to have more patience for all of the snarking and drama and BS where I work, and now I have none. I work with mostly women, and it's a catty atmosphere. \n\nLiterally 2 months before my mom died, I was promoted to a supervisor position. I took it because it meant a better title, but I barely make more money and I have 200% the responsibility. I've discovered that I HATE supervising and \"being in charge\" -- I miss my old position where I did IT work all day in a quiet office I shared with a quiet coworker. I'm pretty introverted. Now I have meetings all day, coworkers to direct, whispers behind doors (I'm \"the man\" and no longer in the union now, which is rife with conflict) and I just want to run away from it all.\n\nI applied for an IT job that is about 2 blocks from where I live (A DREAM) but it's significantly less money and a step down. I'm hoping for an interview, but I've also been sending out resumes to all sorts of jobs that are closer to where I live.\n\nIs it crazy that I want to change my job because I need a distraction from my grief? My job is such a source of stress and I want to be somewhere without coworkers saying they're sorry for talking about mother's day within my earshot. I want a job that conjures NO memories of my mom, one that's a different place. I have enough memories and grief when I'm not at work....\n\nI also feel very apathetic and like I don't care about my job or my performance or really the outcome of anything in my workplace. I still do a stellar job and I just got back a glowing performance review (although perhaps it was from pity due to the year I've had)... but still.\n\nI'm not sure why I even posted this. I suppose this is something I'd be calling my mom to discuss and get her opinion on!", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Stubbornly she refused to go to the Dr. you know how parents are! But she'd always complained of pains all her life so this didn't seem any different but it was.\n\nYou see: Life. Life has been trying to take my mother from me, since I was little. It was one thing after another from cancerous abdominal tumors, throat cancer, skin cancer, 2 corneal transplants w/some complications, Diabetes and complications from BAND surgery later in life.\n\nMy mother has constantly fought, and suffered and won. But this time... she lost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer fatigue continued to get worse, when finally she came down with what we all believed to be was the cold/flu. We took her to the Dr, as she ran a low-grade fever.\n\nThis Dr proscribed her antibiotics, thinking it was just an infection, that was on a Friday. She did NOT improve, so on Monday I took her to the same Dr, he requested a chest Xray that Monday. Nothing came up it seems, and she continued to feel worse; my aunt finally came that Wednesday and took her again, this time he had blood work done.\n\nIt came back with abnormalities, they said and wanted her to the ER right away. So she and my aunt left. That was the last time my mom would ever be home.\n\nShe waited in the ER for over 12 hrs for a room,finally given one Thursday morning. They started taking tests, giving her blood transfusions saying, that the department that runs diagnostic doesn't work the weekends, we'd have to wait until Monday.\n\nThere we are, Friday just trying to get her to feel better, to eat, to drink and she did. It bothered me so much to see her like that. I practically pretended she was fine, she'd be home like every other time but I was secretly crying my eyes out expecting the worst, googling everything I could find on leukemia and other possible prognosis. Then I'd sleep and play some video games like I was in some fantasy world.\n\nEach day though, Friday, Saturday, Sunday she was improving, she was eating more, she was being herself. Saying inappropriate things, telling stories about family members.  My mom was my mom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday came the Dr said she had Leukemia, but her felt so confident he could treat her, that tomorrow (tuesday) they'd give her the type, send her to another hospital that's better at treating it. We were all so excited, so happy, my mom would come home again she'd win another battle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday night/Tuesday morning she began to have more breathing issues, she'd maintained this low grade fever since being admitted Thursday, and she gave them permission to fully intubate her, because he lungs were hardening. The infection she had along with the leukemia was hardening her lungs, from that morning until noon they aggressively treated trying to 'reverse' things if possible but we were told this type of prognosis was very slim.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few hours later I'm holding her hand, in the ICU hooked up to every machine imaginable: Life support. It was over, every battle had finally ended and I stayed with her as they removed the tubes, I had failed her...at least thats how I feel. For not seeing her for two days because I was doing those things; I stayed to the end so maybe she could know, she could tell that I loved her more than life itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a few minutes my mother tried to breathe; her heart slowing, that death-rattle as she involuntarily gasped for air at this point then nothingness. In a few minutes the woman who had defined me and my life was gone. Sleeping eternally before my eyes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was mother and father both, the only parent I had despite having my father (who is mentally ill) who could never care for me, or himself. This woman I had tried to show my love to by giving her everything materialistic I could afford that she never had: new cars, houses, vacations, clothes, anything she wanted I'd try to get it for her. I hope that my mother knows I love her, that I did everything for her and now she's gone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sit here on my PC like I'm in a fantasy world to numb my pain, the internet my only escape as it has ever been. I feel like I'm letting her down by not weeping for hours into the day or night, that I am not 'behaving' like a grieving daughter should. I sat and looked at coffins, flowers, everything I want to make her funeral perfect in the way she wanted. Lilac and purple...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've spent my life being a f\\*ck up, even though I tried my best for that time, that moment, no matter how stupid my idea, how childish I was my Mommy was there, always. Now; I feel like my strength, happiness, purpose in life is gone. All her suffering gone,  never to worry about anything anymore, about anyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother who gave to the world, an angel in this universe where everyone even I, think about ONLY themselves. I can only dream to be a portion the woman my mother was; because that is a legacy no one can touch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm struggling so hard, I havent set up arrangements yet, I haven't even set a date for the funeral. I'm a wreck I'm worried my lack of motivation will lead to me losing everything she fought for and seemed important to her and I just can't bring myself to pull myself out of this hole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I keep sitting here, I keep typing, I keep reading hoping to find the cure to my pain but I know it'll be eternally painful without her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMissing my Mommy......", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I can talk about my moms life and death without any tears and probably seem better off than I actually feel on the inside. \n\nI cry alone and that\u2019s when I feel comfortable to process the emotions. \n\nThe last two days I spent at my moms house going through her things, figuring out with kid wanted what (I have three older siblings) and packing/ cleaning. \n\nI kept it together the whole time and this is the first time I hadn\u2019t gotten emotional going there or leaving, but that\u2019s because I was with my brother and SO, and I have a hard time being emotional in front of other people. \n\nThree days ago my SO asked if I wanted to go to his friends cabin this weekend for labor day. I said yes as I felt that I wanted to. \nBut now, I think maybe after dealing with some of my moms things for a few days without releasing the emotions, i\u2019m sort of an emotional mess. \n\nI really just want to lay around all weekend at home, get some cleaning done, and just relax with my own thoughts. I don\u2019t want to cancel though because I have already said yes to a few things and then ended up canceling, and I don\u2019t want to make a habit of not following through. \n\nBut I can\u2019t seem to help when I feel terrible. I could have maybe prevented feeling so bad today by letting emotions out the past two days but it would have made it hard to focus on what i had to get done there. \n\nI\u2019m most afraid of breaking down emotionally at the cabin, or bringing the whole mood down. I will be with my SO\u2019s friends/ girlfriends who are all very loving, kind, compassionate, and supportive; but, I don\u2019t want to share my grief with them. It will feel awkward no matter how much they tell me it\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t want to bother them with my sad feelings when it\u2019s supposed to be a fun weekend. \n\nI don\u2019t really feel like drinking either, and I don\u2019t really feel like being in party/ celebration mode. It takes a lot of effort to act like I\u2019m okay. I know I don\u2019t have to, but i\u2019m not comfortable enough to open up to anyone emotionally. Not even my SO or my family, let alone friends. \n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s healthier. Taking time for myself to reflect and recharge, or just following through with plans and hoping for the best and enjoying time with friends. My brain is telling me it won\u2019t be enjoyable, although i\u2019m sure it will be a fun time. \n\nI just don\u2019t feel ready to spend a weekend with people who aren\u2019t going through what I am. A call from their mom might trigger me. A conversation might trigger me. I do my best to control how I react but as most people know in this sub, sometimes the grief just crashes over you like a huge wave. \n\nI know not sharing my emotions is a problem, but that\u2019s not something I can fix immediately, but I am aware I should work on that. \n\nI\u2019m just wondering what has worked for other people. What have others done in these situations? I could always drive separately to the cabin and leave if I feel the need. I just mentally and emotionally don\u2019t feel capable to keep it together the whole weekend and have a good time.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He moved out in October and I followed in November.\n\nIn January 2019, I learned I had contracted the HSV2 virus from the guy I\u2019d been seeing who had not disclosed to me. He called me a whore and ghosted me afterward. (He was the only one I\u2019d slept with since the breakup) We haven\u2019t spoken since.

{"post_id": "cxmk31", "created_utc": 1567197445, "title": "My Dad's Eulogy", "author": "clevergreen", "self_text": "I got up at my dad's funeral and spoke to all our friends and family about how he was my absolute hero. I thought maybe it'd be nice to share it on the internet. I'm not sure why. He died of Stage IV Squamous Cell Carcinoma, that returned after reconstruction of his tongue and jaw, chemo, and radiation. I never thought I'd have to say goodbye to a parent at 27. Reading over this reminds me of what a funny and gentle-hearted man he was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;My dad fancied himself the funniest, smartest, most good-looking human to ever grace us with his presence, but if you knew him, you could tell it was an act, like a persona. Behind that was a very humble man. He was someone who didn\u2019t think he deserved it when good things happened to him; who really didn\u2019t think much of himself, who didn\u2019t think he *made* much of himself. But that humility made him gentle and hard-working, and it made him continuously strive to be better and be good to his family.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Even if he didn\u2019t realize it, my daddy taught me a lot of things that I find really valuable in my life, and so I thought I\u2019d share some of them with you:   \n&gt;  \n&gt;1. Be kind to everyone, and always be thoughtful and considerate of those around you. We always joked about how, even through the worst of his sickness, after every shot, poke, prod, or yank, he would always give a light-hearted, \u201cok, thank you!\u201d I learned by watching him, that even when you\u2019re your worst self, you should always put out your best self, and you should always give thought to what you say to others, because people remember that about you.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;People remember you by how you made them feel. My dad knew someone everywhere we went. He could just pick up a conversation with a near stranger, because he recognized him from a Guitar Center in 2014. My dad had a lot of friends\u2014I think people gravitated towards him because he could find a common interest with anyone, and that made people feel an easy connection. It\u2019s funny because he normally came off as quiet and standoffish, but that usually never lasted\u2014 all you had to do was tell him you liked his hair, or his tattoos.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;2. Be kind and gentle towards animals. We made fun of my dad, and called him Father Nature or a Garden Gnome. Other peoples\u2019 pets flocked to him at parties, like they could sniff out his benevolence. Our own pets favored him over my mother and I, even though we coaxed them with table scraps and snacks. Didn\u2019t matter\u2014 they perched on his lap with pride as soon as he sat down. The animals that live outside our house were his, too. He made sure to keep the bird bath topped off with fresh water, he left dry cat food out in hidden spots for the stray cats, and he\u2019d shoo rabbits out of the street at 3 in the morning because he was afraid they\u2019d get hit by a car. My mom actually just reminded me recently of the time he said he learned that pigs cried when they felt pain, and so he decided he was not going to eat pork anymore.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3. Be thankful for everything you have in your life, even the things you wouldn\u2019t normally consider. The surgery to remove the tumor in January took a little more than half his tongue, and damaged a lot of muscles in his neck and throat, which caused him to have dysphagia, which is an inability to swallow. It was something we were going to begin rehabilitating after treatment, but for those months after surgery, he had a feeding tube, and that\u2019s how he got pretty much all of his food and nourishment. There\u2019s a picture I have of him, in particular, from February\u2014 in the photo he has his feeding tube and he\u2019s sitting at the kitchen table and he looks just elated. In that moment, he had just tasted some cream of mushroom soup for the first time in a couple months, and he told me \u201cThat was the most delicious soup I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d And I was like, \u201cCream of mushroom is disgusting but whatever.\u201d   \n&gt;  \n&gt;But ever since then, when I\u2019d run to catch an elevator I'd think to myself, *I\u2019m so glad I have these legs to run.* When I\u2019d hear really good song come on in the car I\u2019d think, *I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m sitting here in my car enjoying music and sunshine.* I think I\u2019ll always do that now, thanks to my dad.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;4. Find the thing that makes your heart sing and your personality shine, and keep it close to you for as long as you live. He, of course, liked comic books and horror movies and reading and bad British comedy, but we all knew music was his true love. I couldn\u2019t say all this about him and leave out his love of music. He could play any instrument you handed him, just give him a couple minutes to pluck around on it and he\u2019d figure a little something out. Play a song of any genre and he knew who recorded it, what album it came off of, and then he'd have a recommendation for another song you might like.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Music was his thing, his over-arching theme in his life. My parents surrounded me with music growing up, and I think it was because he wanted to submerse me in his most favorite thing, the thing that made him, him. We went to concerts, saw cover bands, waited around to get autographs; and when I got older he started taking me to concerts of bands I liked (while making fun of them), and taught me to have a CD booklet and sharpie on me at all times, ready at a moment\u2019s notice, just in case.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;There was a time when I was very young, I remember actually wondering if he was a Beatle. He would bring me on his usual record store rounds and I remember seeing the Let It Be album cover at some point, where they all had long hair and beards and mustaches and I remember looking closely at them and really had to think about, ok so *which one is him?* He really got into karaoke in the last few years, and would make me sing Beatles songs with him, so I could sing the Paul harmonies while he sang the John part. I was always like \u201cGod, Dad, you\u2019re so embarrassing,\u201d but he loved it so much. He was always our favorite Beatle. He played like George, acted like John, looked like Paul, and sang like Ringo. \ud83d\ude02  \n&gt;  \n&gt;5. Be sure to always recognize the people in your life, to pay attention to them, and express to them how they inspire you when you get the opportunity. For example, my mom is fierce, and I admire her ability to make things happen when you need her help. My fianc\u00e9 is full of such light and encouragement, he brightens the mood in every room he enters.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;I wish I would have taken the time to tell my dad how he inspired me. One day while I was driving him to treatment, he sat in the passenger seat of my car, and with tears in his eyes, said, \u201cIf there\u2019s anything you ever wondered or wanted to know about me, I want you to know, you can just ask me. I want you to feel like you know me.\u201d And I brushed it off and joked and said, \u201cTrust me, I know enough.\u201d But now I wish I would have given him more recognition when I had the chance, and I hope he knows that I did know him. I watched him so intently my whole life.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Tell your people you love them, every day.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;6. Lettuce does not belong on sandwiches.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

She had been talking with her single friend and they decided that she would buy a condo and her friend would pay rent.   She went through the entire process of looking at places, negotiating contracts, due diligence and financing and they close next Thrusday.   She bent over backwards to hide all of this.   During this time she even told me how great our relationship was, that I was clearly climbing out of the grief from all the trauma (because I was very above board about EVERYTHING I was feeling, what i was doing about it and very deliberate about doing things TOGETHER to ensure that the relationship wasnt taken for granted.\n\nSo now she has started the process of moving out of the home/life we built and this hurts more that all of the other tragedies that have happened.

Meanwhile, I bought a house across the country, moved while 8months pregnant, and welcomed my first child into the world.\n\nYesterday marked the one year anniversary of my sister-in-law losing her battle with cancer. She was 37. I was across the country in Denver when I found out, and being very close to my brother I hopped on the next plane to go be with him in Baltimore. I stayed for a week. \n\nOne day into my stay, we get a phone call that our father has been rushed to the hospital for emergency open heart surgery. my brother fortunately lived very close to the hospital, so we met Pops on his way into the OR to say \u2018I love you and good luck\u2019. \n\nSurgery went well. My father had congestive heart failure and one of the leads to his pacemaker (internal) had developed a mass. They removed the mass and all of the leads and planned to replace the pacemaker once he was rehabilitated from such invasive surgery. \n\nA few days later, they had services for my sister-in-law. I went through the motions with my brother as he shopped for a suit, sorted through photos, and tried to figure out how to live a life without his best friend and one true love. He had been living with his wife at a home they rented from his MIL, and already she had started asking questions about his plans. It was horrible to watch helplessly as my big brother, went through such a living nightmare. \n\nI flew back to Denver a few days after the service and after my dad had been cleared. He was to stay in the cardiac unit a while and then move on to do rehab and eventually go home. \n\nOH YEAH, meanwhile I am also 6.5 months pregnant at this time! My husband stayed in Denver because we needed his income and couldn\u2019t afford the cost of double plane travel. ALSO, we were planning to move back to Baltimore so we were in the middle of buying a house, across the country, while juggling doctors appointments and picking up our belongings.\n\nLess than two weeks go by, and I receive a call from my brother\u2019s sister-in-law. There has been an accident and my brother has fallen 2.5 stories off of the roof of his home. He and a neighbor were moving furniture off of the roof when he slipped and fell. He fractured one leg in multiple places and had severe injuries to his face and head, but there was not internal bleeding and he was in the ICU. \n\nI couldn\u2019t afford to fly back out, and by now we had settled on a house with plans to move back in six weeks. I spent every day on the phone with doctors - my dad\u2019s, my brother\u2019s, and my own. I coordinated with close friends of my brother to let them know what happened and to arrange visits when possible. My dad was recovering, with some complications due to blood pressure and renal failure (common after heart surgery), but was slowly improving. He was delirious at first but after about a week that seemed to mostly clear. My brother was in a medically induced coma and intubated, and eventually underwent a number of surgeries on his leg and foot. \n\nFinally, we moved back to Baltimore. My husband drove our car across the country and I flew by myself - 8 months pregnant and carrying a cat! Lol!. But we made it. We got somewhat unpacked, and within a week I was able to visit both Dad and brother. \n\nIt was AWFUL to see my brother that way. He looked like a ghost of himself and had lost so much weight. Around this time they started to reduce his sedation drugs, so after a week or so he was regaining consciousness. At first he was completely delusional. He didn\u2019t always recognize people and did not remember who had visited. He was confused and it was heartbreaking to watch, and to wonder if we would ever get him back.\n\nMy dad was moved to a rehab center and was doing better, now fighting a bad infection in his arm from where the IV leads were. He was not eating and therefor not regaining strength. My brother was regaining memory slowly, and one day started to seem much more \u2018with it\u2019. We realized quickly that he had forgotten about his wife\u2019s passing. Being the closest to him, I arranged for a number of family members to be present, and I went in ahead with my mother to relay the awful news. Once I gently reminded him, he did remember the other details of her passing and even planning the services, and as painful as it was it appeared to be the trigger he needed to start progressing mentally. a few weeks later he too was moved to a rehab facility.\n\nNot a week later, my first child was born. I had a relatively event-free birth and everyone was healthy. \n\nThe same day I went home, my brother was sent home to stay with my sister. My father was not doing well, he was still not eating and he had an episode that rushed him back to the cardiac ICU. I spent the days learning how to care for a newborn and counting down until I could take him to meet his Poppy. Unfortunately that never happened. My father passed away about a month after my son was born, being in the ICU I couldn\u2019t bring an infant into the unit. My brother was actually recovering from his last surgery in the same hospital, a few floors up, the night we went to say goodbye to my dad. He was discharged that night and met us all in the ICU to say his final goodbye. My heart shattered as I kissed the man who raised me, who took such pride in his kids, who absolutely couldn\u2019t have loved any harder, for the last time. \n\nTwo weeks later was Christmas. Suffice it to say that we didn\u2019t do a whole lot of celebrating, but we faked it when needed for the kids. \n\nMy brother, having suffered a severe head injury, had some good moments and bad in subsequent months. He did not see his neurologist or therapist regularly and it occasionally seemed he was taking more than the prescribed amount of pain medication. \n\nLess than five months after my father died, my brother was found dead in his room at my sisters apartment. The toxicology and autopsy did not reveal much, and the cause of death death was ( two months later) ruled unknown. \n\nIt has been three months since this happened and I am still so heartbroken. Not a day goes by where I do not bawl my eyes out for all of this terrible loss. I\u2019m not really sure how life goes on from here, I know it does, but it certainly will never be the same.\n\nMy son is now nine months old and will never meet his poppy or his uncle or his aunt\u2026 But I have to find a way to have their memory live on so he can know who they were. \n\nI\u2019m open to suggestions.\n\nSincerely, \nBroken Mama", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I also suffered severe sexual assault and exploitation. The last thing was that my sister and three of my nieces were killed by a drunk driver. All of these things happened within a span of three years. In order to survive I just shut down, and carried on.\n\nEvery single time I would come close to crying I would feel nauseated and either throw up or gag. It got so bad that I would feel nauseous when I felt sad or thought about the past. This went on for more than a decade.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started feeling emotional, heavy, and extremely irritated with everyone. Above all, I just craved being alone. I also started crying. I mean, crying so much that it feels endless. Like a bottomless well. I cry about everything and nothing. I just want to curl up in a blanket with some wine and never leave my house. \n\nTo be clear: I do not think it is clinical depression; I have been there, and this is not the same. I still actually get up and get my stuff done, though not perfectly. At least, though, I can say that it is not the crippling inability to keep up that comes with depression. \n\nTL;DR: after years of repression I might be suffering from complicated grief, but I need some advice from someone who knows what it looks like.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I had heard a decent number of stories about him and everyone having incredible experiences in his DnD games, and all the drinking stories. \n\nI had just moved into the house. This house had been occupied by \"the dnd crew\" (including him) for years before, and when they all moved out, we took over. All of us a few years younger, but most of the others moving in were already friends with the former occupants. \n\nWell when he came over to pick up the last of his stuff, he brought a bottle of Don Julio someone had bought him. And those of us present, he gave us a taste. We then all talked DnD for an hour or two. \n\nSkip ahead a couple months, and I got invited to one of his legendary dnd games. (For those familiar, I'm talking Critical Role level dnd games with a much more in depth/realistic world, but less voice actor skills. Either way, absolutely fucking legendary)  it's been about a year since I joined as my favorite character i have ever made/played. \n\nWell, he killed himself last weekend. And I still..fuck. I can't figure this out. Why or how or what. I split my knuckles open at work today when I got pissed. I dont know why he did it. I dont even regret punching the pillar, it was a welcome distraction. \n\nBut we had the visitation today, and they decided on open casket. So the visitation wasnt bad. One of the other players in our dnd game was his best friend. And all of us players talked with a few other friends for a good amount of time before heading to a bar. \n\nThing is, it was open casket. It felt wrong. It feels wrong. Even just referring to him in the past tense feels so fucking wrong. I keep expecting the notification for our next dnd session. \nBut I'm trying to picture him at the head of the table to my left, describing our location. Or roleplaying a beloved character. I dont fucking know how to feel. \n\nI realized tonight, listening to all his stories, I've barely got anything. I have our dnd game. And aside from that, I've got like two memories. I barely got a chance to know him. I could have gotten to know him more, but I didnt. \n\nHis funeral is tomorrow. I'm not fucking ready.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

She was 15 this year and in end-stage kidney failure. So there wasn't really much we could do. I'd had her since I was nine. We got her when she was five months old. She was a rescue. And a really really good pup.\n\nI'm in the process of moving. As in, I'm literally moving to a new city away from my small town on Sunday. My twin sister moved the week before. She actually drove back up to say goodbye to Daisy. She's a wreck. I mean, we all are, but she is a lot more sentimental about things and she was incredibly close to Daisy.\n\nA few months ago we had to put down my ESA Kanu. Kanu was the best cat you could ask for. He was always there for me during the time we thought my heart would stop any day. He would always be up for a cuddle. He purred like a motorboat. He was just so sweet and gentle and always by my side. \n\nWe had to put him down right before we left for my sister's college graduation. Like legit we had to put him down and then drive down to my sister's college. He'd been having problems breathing and we took him to the vet who said he was likely going to throw a clot and probably wouldn't survive the weekend. Kanu was an old cat. He was 17 years old. The vet said even if they found the exact problem, there wasn't much he could do. Kanu most likely wouldn't survive the testing, much less any treatment. His tongue was purplish. \n\nHim dying hurt me like Daisy hurt my sister dying. I'm a bulimic and I relapsed BAD after he died. I'm still in said relapse. He was such a help for me beforehand.\n\nLastly, my dad died in 2013. On July 4th. His death ripped my already shaky family apart. My mom, who had problems before, became very toxic and emotionally abusive. Our relationship is better now but we still have a lot of problems and while she isn't as openly toxic or abusive or anything, our relationship is very much strained and will never be the same. In general my family is bad with emotions. I'm kinda the emotional punching bag for everyone because I'm the resident fuck-up. But that's not the point.\n\nI just feel so disheartened. Everyone in my family seems to die at the worst times. And the blow of Kanu still hasn't gotten any softer and now Daisy is gone. And it's just hard. And it hurts. And I can't turn to my family for comfort because I know my mom is incapable of giving it to me and my sister is too hurt herself to be able to. And it sucks. It just sucks.\n\nHonestly, I feel worse about them then I did my dad. Which makes me feel bad, too. Because my dad was my dad. We didn't necessarily have the best relationship but he was my dad and he died suddenly. We didn't even get a week or a few days of 'oh they seem sick' like we did with my pets. Dad's heart just stopped while on a run. \n\nI'm just tired of feeling sad and feeling like I have nowhere to feel sad. And IDK I thought maybe getting this out here would help. I'm enclosing pictures of Kanu and Daisy. I don't have any of my dad.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/tbo8gqld6qj31.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/z0qorpld6qj31.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/5ok64rld6qj31.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/gxxlwqld6qj31.jpg", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}
