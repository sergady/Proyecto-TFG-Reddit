She had been more of a second mother to me than an Aunt and at the time the loss affected me deeply, my job performance suffered and I never really recovered physically from bad eating and poor sleeping coping mechanisms I developed around then. About a year after my Aunt passed my younger sister suddenly passed away from what the coroner finally called an asthma attack in her sleep which led to cardiac arrest. She was only 21. \n\n I have been in therapy, I have tried. I have a job, pay my taxes and am married with a wonderful 15 month old baby but it all seems to to be going through the motions. Life feels like a haze. On the 19th of March my mother who was only 52 died suddenly while in the hospital for a series of seemingly mild issues, even getting her instructions on what to when released, when she entered ventricular fibrillation and despite being on the cardiac floor of a quality hospital she coded and they were unable to resuscitate her. \n\nI just have no idea what to do. I feel like I don't have any grief left. I have been numb for weeks. I sit through the work day counting down the minutes until I can pick up my daughter from day care.

At the time, I was about 34 weeks pregnant with his first grandchild. I got a phone call from my sister at 3am to tell me that he'd passed, and my mom had been the one to find him in the garage (my parents have both smoked since they were teenagers, and they do it in the garage to keep the smell out of the house). My mom had gotten up for work and since my dad wasn't in bed, she expected to find him sleeping in his seat in the garage, but as soon as she saw him, she knew he was gone. Massive heart attack, which wasn't too surprising, really. He was diabetic, had never been great about eating well or exercising, not even after his five bypass open heart surgery almost 7 years prior. But while the cause of death wasn't surprising, obviously the fact that he died in his sleep was devastating.\n\nEven more devastating was that I live 2000 miles from my family, across the country, and being as pregnant as I was, I couldn't travel to see them and only had my husband for comfort, who was great, but I knew felt hopeless because he couldn't actually do anything but hold me when I needed. It was difficult, to say the least, especially since I knew how bad stress was for the growing baby in my belly, so I tried not to think about it, which really meant that I ended up spending a lot of time sleeping in that last month before I gave birth.\n\nI didn't get to see my family until my son was five weeks old and they came on a pre-planned visit to meet him. My dad originally had a ticket, too, but my mom was able to get his refunded due to the circumstances. They stayed for a week before going home, and two weeks later me, my husband, and our two-month-old traveled to my home town for my dad's memorial, which had been postponed until the baby would be okay to travel. That day was both rough and also reassuring. I got to see some old friends of my dad's, family that I hadn't seen in years, and everyone fawned over my son, who was a ray of sunshine for everyone he met, living and smiling proof that life goes on.\n\nIn the time since, I've mostly been focused on taking care of and getting to know my son. I'm lucky that he's been a relatively easy baby. Started sleeping through the night around 2.5 months, doesn't fuss unless there's genuinely something wrong, smiles and laughs a lot... He's wonderful, and I'm so happy to get to be his mom. We have a lot of fun together, especially these days now that he's 9 months old and crawling and getting into everything. Watching him discover the world around him is such a treat.\n\nI think of my dad at least a little everyday, and most of the time it's with a smile. My son blows raspberries on my bare shoulder often, which makes me think of how I apparently used to do the same to my shirtless dad as a baby. I know my dad would laugh his ass off and tell me how it's pure karma. But some days the grief still knocks me sideways, and yesterday was the worst day I've had in a while.\n\nAmazon photos had some pictures from years past to show me, and it included a short clip from Snapchat of my dad laughing childishly while my mom complains faintly in the background about not being able to breathe (he'd just let out a super stinky fart, that actually tells you a lot about how my dad was, lol). Normally when I'm feeling down, I actually seek out this video to cheer me up. But I watched it a few times, and showed my curious baby too. But watching him watch my dad laugh kind of broke me. He was interested that there was laughter, but it was a super disconnected interest. I might as well have been showing him a random YouTube video of a stranger laughing. And it hit me all over again how unfair it is that he died so young. My parents were only 18 and 23 when I was born, so I always imagined getting to grow old with them. \n\nMy dad got to know that I was pregnant, that it was a boy (I only have sisters), and even his name, but never got to hold him. My son will know about him, but will never love him. How could he? His Pawpaw will only ever be a collection of stories and old pictures to him. And my mom is struggling so much and refuses to seek help (she's been an alcoholic since before my dad died, but doesn't see it that way) so I'm forced to consider the possibility that she won't get to see my son reach adulthood. \n\nI'm not really sure what I'm looking for here. I stumbled across this subreddit in an AskReddit thread and thought maybe typing up my feelings would help, but I'm not sure if it has. If you've read through this rambling mess, I commend you for getting this far, and I hope everything made sense. ", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

She kept her hair in a plastic grocery bag because she missed her hair so much. She lost the ability to walk a month before she came home on hospice  and wanted to walk again that she requested a walker. Hospice told us she had a month or so left but she felt it was more like 15 days. She died at 16 days of being home. I had spent part of December and all of January with her taking her to appointments and literally in and out of emergency rooms. We spent New Years Eve and day in the hospital. :( She wanted me to come back home to my wife and so I did and then she died 16 days later. I had made plans to go see her again for her birthday but she died a week before (March 10th was her birthday). That was one of the hardest day of my life. Since then I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression which my PCP feels I had I undiagnosed from before. Anyway all of this happened so quickly. I\u2019m on celexa now and I feel numb and have cried a lot less than at first. Thanks for reading all of this. ", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I had three years since her cancer diagnosis to process what was going to happen, and knew the actual end was coming for a while before it did, so I feel like I was pretty ok when it happened. I woke up on a Saturday morning to about 50 missed calls from my aunt, trying desperately to reach me before someone posted on Facebook. I knew immediately what had happened, and didn\u2019t really cry that much. I was able to go on with work and classes that Monday. Following her wishes, we had a non-traditional \u201cservice\u201d about 6 months after the fact. It was basically a big picnic and party on the lake, to get together with our widespread family, and we had a slide show and moments to speak about memories, a good cry, and the rest of the day was a blast. It was good closure, and a reminder of who is still here, and that she\u2019s the reason we are who we are. \n\nSometimes I remember my last memories with her, and how they often come first these days, blacking our the many good times we had. Those are the ones that are getting harder to recall. I can remember vividly staying with her, flushing out her ports with saline, giving her injections, I can remember exact numbers when I weighed her and took her vitals. I struggle to remember what we did for my 16th birthday or what her special techniques for our favorite meals were. I wish I had absorbed more, written things down, taken photos. I think I remember the last few years so vividly because I knew that they were going to be the last, that any morning I was going to wake her up for her infusion and I\u2019d be making *the* phone call. I was trying to digest and savor every single second...why couldn\u2019t I have done that with the good days?\n\nI can still remember her voice clearly, but certain mannerisms and features are slipping away. Why can I remember her cough more than her eyes? The measurement guide for her colostomy bag was indigo, but were her glasses silver or gold? What was the exact color of her hair before it turned white?\n\nI just moved into my first house the day before yesterday, and today I\u2019ve been crying more than unpacking. More than I\u2019ve cried since she\u2019s been gone, I think. So much has happened since she\u2019s been here, luckily more good than bad, but it\u2019s tainted by the fact that I can\u2019t share any of it with her. I graduated college a month after she passed. The stark contrast of my high school graduation photo with her by my side, and my college graduation photo of me standing alone says it all. I\u2019ve traveled, climbed the tallest mountain in the US, moved across the country twice, adopted a cat, bought a car, and I\u2019ll be getting married soon. All of it my first thought was always that I wanted to tell her. Then, I move into this house and it wasn\u2019t my first thought anymore. I don\u2019t want to move on, because I feel like I have nowhere to move on to except an island of my own. \n\nMy brother and I have drifted, my cousins who were once so united by her presence have fallen into their own lives without our matriarch to bring us together. I haven\u2019t seen most of them since the \u201cfuneral\u201d. My fianc\u00e9 is great, but there\u2019s something about those lost  familial connections that just adds to my grief. I feel abandoned. It\u2019s hard to explain to him, because he hasn\u2019t experienced any close losses. We just had a friend pass away last week, and I feel that\u2019s subconsciously bringing this back to the forefront, thinking about how his children will now have to learn to navigate a world without the person who taught them to live in it, just as I am still trying to do. \n\nI just feel like whenever a big event happens in my life, I\u2019m grieving her all over again. Even thinking of her less makes it worse. Most days are fine. \n\nDays like this are hard. ", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He was sick for a couple of years before he passed and my mother told me a week or so after my birthday (he was sick at my birthday party but they didn't want to tell me before and ruin it for me I guess.) and he started treatment pretty soon after that. I just remember how quickly he started looking ill, it was weird like one day he looked fine and then all of a sudden his hair was going and he was getting real skinny and kept being sick and was in so much pain like every movement would hurt him. And I remember one day I was reading upstairs and my parents came in and he'd been told that things were looking up and that he only had a couple treatments left and I was so happy because I thought I was gonna get my Dad back soon and everything was ok again and then somehow I guess it spread and we were back in the same boat. He just got weaker and weaker and I watched him decline to the point where he needed a damn stair lift at age 57 because he couldn't even walk upstairs but somehow it didn't occur to me he was dying because no one ever said to me that he was gonna die. The way I found out was my Mum burst into my room at like 6 in the morning which I knew was weird because I didn't have to get up for school until 7:30 and I was like what's going on? And then she just said ''I have to go to the hospital'' and I asked her if everything was gonna be okay and she just said no and then next thing I was downstairs and my auntie was there and then my Mum was gone. To be honest I don't remember any of that day until it was about 7pm and my Mum came home and just said ''he's gone sweetheart'' and that was it.\n\nIt feels like the world just gets ripped from under your feet. Since then I just kind of drift not enjoying anything and being angry and sad all the time and it's pointless because I'm hurting myself and the ones I love because of it and it's all because I can't get over his death. And to be honest I feel like I've been grieving for so long now that I don't know how to do anything else like I'm stuck in a hole that I just keep digging deeper into rather than trying to climb out. I never got to say goodbye to him and to be honest I'm so angry at my Mum and my Dad for not telling me that he was dying and that he wasn't just in the hospital but a hospice and everybody including my sister (10 years my senior) knew except me. I feel guilty for being mad at them because I know they didn't do it to be mean or hurt me they were just trying to keep me safe but it's done way more damage than good because if I'd gotten to say the things I want and need to say to him so badly maybe I'd be able to get over it. I'm scared of letting go because I don't want to let him go but I need to but I just don't know how. \n", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Yesterday was so painful and heartbreaking.\n\nA few weeks ago, my cat Tigger went missing. He knows his way around so this struck me as weird. I called the animal shelter, searched the neighborhood every few days, and posted to Facebook. People saw him around where I lived. I know this because he has a swirly pattern on his belly and was born without a few toes. His belly also hung and jiggled when he walked. He was truly a special kitty that anyone would notice. \n\nEver since a week ago, I've been having dreams of him. I'd find him somehow and he'd run into my arms and beg me to hold him. I even had a dream of the first time I met him, before Hurricane Katrina. The skies were dark and dreary, and my family was preparing to evacuate. And he was just a small kitten who kept coming to our house. But this time, I was my current age (18) instead of 5, and he was a grown cat rather than a kitten. He would beg me for a bath, which is strange because he HATED baths. There were several other dreams with the same situation happening. I thought of it as hope that I would find my baby soon. \n\nI came home from school yesterday, and my mom called me. Coincidentally, I was in the driveway when she asked me where I was. She then told me to come inside. She opens the back door and tells me \"We found him\" \n\nWords can NOT describe my excitement. I was so happy! My heart immediately started racing. But then I looked at my mom's face. \n\nAnd then I looked back. \n\nAnd there he was. Dead. Already decomposing, beyond recognition. It all happened so fast and I remember his position on the ground, but then it changes in my mind. I don't even remember what happened, I just remembered falling and crying so hard that I lost my breath. \n\nThat wasn't him :( That was his outer shell, his soul was no longer in a live body to directly communicate with me. He is gone, and I had to see that traumatizing image. It will be burned in my mind for the rest of my life.  \n\nI asked my mom if she was sure that it was him. She sadly was. I cried on her for what felt like hours. A piece of his fur blew onto the cement. It was clean and smelled just like him, rather than the pungent odor of death. In fact, it smelled just like his favorite flea shampoo. I'm gonna buy a special box for it to keep on my dresser. \n\nHaving to bury my baby was the most painful, heartbreaking thing I have ever needed to do. It took me so long to write this post because of all the tears. It's hard to eat or smile anymore. \n\nBut my mom helped me realize something. He was never missing, he just didn't want us to see him in pain from his old age. He came home to rest forever, and wanted to spare us the hurt of seeing him like that. And those dreams were because he was letting me know he made it over the rainbow bridge. Why else would my mind be revisiting times I had forgotten about? When I reflected on this, it hit me. \n\nThe last time he was in my house, I gave him a bath. But that time, I got in the bath with him so he wouldn't be as scared. He came in my dream to take a bath because it was the last thing we did together. \n\nTigger, I am so sorry. Momma is so sorry she couldn't be there with you for your last breaths. I am so sorry I couldn't do so much for you. I am so sorry my brother abandoned you after taking you in, and leaving you to me, busy with college and work. I am so sorry my baby. I know you forgave me and keep thanking me in my dreams. I keep seeing signs from you everywhere! \n\nI don't think I'll ever be the same again. Tigger, you left a paw print on my heart.

If I ever try to bring his mum or his sister up, he just shuts me down and says that he doesn't want to speak to me about it, but I'm worried because I know that he isn't speaking to anyone else so all this crap is just building up in his brain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd to make matters worse, it's his seventeenth birthday soon and I don't know what to get him. I asked him if he wanted to celebrate his birthday this year, and he said he will as long as it's not something big or over the top, and I respect that. I just don't know what to buy him! I know that he probably just wants his sister back, but I obviously can't get him that. I don't know whether to get him something normal or get him something to remind him of his sister. The fact  that he's a twin has made it even worse because he's never actually spent a birthday alone. They always had joint parties because it was easier and they basically had the same group of friends.\n\nI don't really know if anyone can help me here, but I'm desperate and don't know where else to turn. Everyone I know in real life just tells me to treat him normally, but it's really difficult when nothing is normal.\n\n**EDIT: Thank-you all so much for your replies. I discussed the possibility of him going to therapy and he seems up to it. So, again, thank-you.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Yet, as time went on, the reality of this man's decisions have set in and I cannot get over how fucking mad I am at him at all times.\n\nI didn't know this, but he would always tell my mother that he was going to be the first one to die (even though he was nine years younger than my Mom). He would say this to her, all while WILLINGLY not getting life insurance - not writing a will - not building a joint bank account for my Mom for emergencies. And that was only the start.\n\nWe later came to realize that he had also been cheating on my Mom (something that used to happen early in their marriage but had *supposedly* stopped) - not only was he cheating - but he was spending around $600 a month (at the least) on hookers, prostitutes, escorts, whatever you want to call it.\n\nHe also convinced my Mom that she didn't have to worry about paying taxes because *they didn't make enough for the IRS to care* \\- he knew she didn't know anything about this, yet still fed her this bullshit story - so on top of it all, my Mom has to figure out how to pay the IRS back for over 6 years in back taxes.\n\nI recognize that my Mom should have known better, or that she should of left him, but she didn't.\n\nWe are holding a service for him later this month, and my family wants me to speak about it but I am having a very hard time even building the desire to do so. I am so fucking pissed at him - he has corrupted my mom - cheated on her endlessly - made her feel like she is worthless - and now he's fucking dead. And I don't think I will ever be able to forgive him.\n\nI honestly don't know how I'm going to get through the service, because everyone is going to talk about how *amazing*  and how *kind* he was, and I just can't fucking hear it, but I also can't not go.\n\nIdk what I'm looking to get out of this - there just really isn't anyone else I can say this to because everyone is either tired of hearing it - or simply doesn't want to - and I have absolutely no where to put all this anger and frustration.\n\nI am so scared that I am going to force people away from me because I am having such a hard time getting over this. \n\nAt the end of the day, the ONLY positive thing to come from that man was my little brother - who is one of the biggest blessings I've had in my life - and for him alone, I really wish I could muster the courage to say something nice at the service.\n\nAnyway, if you made it this far - thanks for reading - I already kinda feel better for having said it - I just feel like I'm the only one who cares (which I know is a selfish mentality and cannot possibly be true as my mom was the one who got cheated on, I'm sure she cares a lot and isn't saying anything) - I'm rambling at this point - I'm just furious and really wish I wasn't.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

It was expected in the sense of he'd been having severe health issues for the last 5-6 years, but I think we all thought that he would be with us for at least a couple more months. I flew home for the funeral (I'm a student in school pretty far away from home). The entire thing was really rough, especially on my mom and her sister (his kids), but he had been talking about being ready to go for a bit, so I think we all knew he was at peace. It was still really hard for me though; I hadn't really lost anyone close to me at that point. \n\nThat was all about a week and a half before my spring break. The day after I got home for break, my parents took our 7-year-old, supposedly healthy dog, Jagger, to a vet hospital because he was having breathing problems. Three days later he was dead. He'd been more lethargic lately, but my mom honestly thought he was just sad because I left for school. They took him to the vet about a month and a half before and found out he had a thyroid problem, but in the end it was a heart issue we didn't even know about. After everything with my grandpa, taking Jagger to the vet kind of took a backseat until it was too late. Along with that, the whole thing was related to the food we were feeding him. My parents, especially my dad, feel like it was completely their fault even though they had no idea about it. \n\nThe three days before he went were honestly the worst days of my life. The last time I saw him alive he didn't even seem to recognize that we were there. Jagger was such a kind dog who always gave me and everyone so much love and he and my other dog were such loving and happy parts of my life; they were always my favorite part of getting home after being out or from school. His entire death was so painful and the last thing he deserved. \n\nI'm back at school now and feel like a mess. All of this grief feels so big and I don't know how to feel it. I feel stupid talking to most of my friends about Jagger because the ones who have been the most supportive lost grandparents first semester so they really understand that and it feels like I'm belittling their losses by talking about my dog. And although there are some people at school who did know my grandpa and Jagger, it's really hard being away from my parents and sister. I don't even want to think about going home to a house that doesn't have Jagger in it and a town that doesn't have my grandpa there. I feel lost. I just don't know how to move forward with this pain into a world that doesn't have either of them in it. ", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

The only person that\u2019s ever taken me fishing was my father when I was like 4, maybe. But he died when I was 8. \n\nI definitely didn\u2019t know how to process it at the time. My relationship with him was kind of weird growing up. I absolutely hated staying at his house, (he and my mom separated before I was even born) he was the total opposite of my mother when it came to parenting style. My mom was chill and spoiled me while my dad was strict and had three other daughters I had to deal with, along with a wife whom I did not like. Most nights I\u2019d spend there I\u2019d literally cry in bed wishing I could go home to my mom. Apparently when I was rly little I\u2019d cry when he\u2019d come pick me up from my mom\u2019s house. He even once gave me a talk about how he rly tried to be a good father but how I wasn\u2019t being a good daughter since I didn\u2019t want to be there? I don\u2019t quite remember the specifics but I just remember I cried bc he made me feel rly guilty. But obviously point is I absolutely hated being there. \n\nSo when he died I almost felt a sense of relief. I didn\u2019t have to stay at his house and suffer anymore. No more annoying little half sister. No more bitchy step mom. No more 2 hour tv limits. No more crying at night. But I also felt guilty for feeling like this. It\u2019s kind of fucked up to feel some sense of happiness from a family member\u2019s death, right??\n\nAnd of course I did also feel some sadness. Bc even with all the negatives, there still were some nice moments like the rare times I didn\u2019t have to share him with his wife or other kids. When he taught me how to throw ninja stars and shoot a B.B. gun or when we\u2019d build bionacles together while watching lord of the rings. It\u2019s taken me a long long time to realize this, but he actually was a really good father. Now that I\u2019m older I can appreciate how he tried to raise me and appreciate even more all the good times he gave me. This all did not hit me until today when I saw a father fishing with his daughter at the lake. I realized how I took my time with him for granted and felt absolutely terrible for hating being at his house. I let myself cry it out in the car in the way home. I\u2019m so sorry, Dad, that I didn\u2019t appreciate you and everything you did for me. I know I was so young and couldn\u2019t have rly known any better but it still breaks my heart. I miss you and wish you were here to see me now at 22. I wish I got to experience having a father growing up. I wish I could know what you\u2019d think of me now and if you\u2019d be proud of me. Sometimes I can\u2019t help but think about how much I\u2019ve missed out on since you died so early. \n\nI haven\u2019t visited his grave in many years, but I plan on going once the semester is over. I don\u2019t know who to talk to about this since having a parent die at a young age isn\u2019t a common experience.

It got to a point where my little sister asked, \u201ccan\u2019t we have a conversation where we *don\u2019t* talk about her?\u201d That hurt me, but I honored her wishes. For the longest time I only talked about OS to my mom, the only other person who wanted to talk about her.\n\nA few weeks ago she called me to talk about birthday gifts (we have 4 in our family within a few weeks). She told me later that she had thought, \u201cI should call OS to see what X niece wants for her birthday,\u201d  she called me to talk about it and I failed to realize she was reaching out.  I kinda blew her off and said, \u201coh, yeah, that happens,\u201d and changed the subject.\n\nI feel badly that I didn\u2019t honor her grief, but for me, I\u2019m past that point. I dealt with it elsewhere because that\u2019s what she requested.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m looking for here. I guess I just had to get that off my chest.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My uncles, dad and myself thought of her as our world and grandpa was our hero (this post in particular is about her tho). \n\nIn 2015, a week before mother\u2019s day, she felt ill and had to go to the hospital. I was 17 at the time and my family wouldn\u2019t tell me much of what was going on, but a couple of days before her passing my mom took me to visit her and on our way back I was telling her \u201cdad said grandma is getting better, hopefully she\u2019ll be home soon\u201d and my mom snapped and finally told the truth: My grandma had been diagnosed with cancer - iirc it was stomach cancer - and they weren\u2019t doing chemo or harsh treatment as she was in her 80s, my dad just didn\u2019t want to tell me. I was shocked. A week later, she passed away. It was the hardest moment in my life, I sobbed so much and just slept through most of the day, I didn\u2019t know how life would be without her. It was also the first funeral I went to and I broke down at the sight of her. She looked peaceful and beautiful but I didn\u2019t want to let her go. \n\nSince then, every time I try to talk about her my family shuts it down or feels uncomfortable. We haven\u2019t had any honest conversations about this that weren\u2019t interrupted or quickly ended with some \u201cshe\u2019s watching over us\u201d, \u201cjust keep working to make her proud\u201d or similar quote. I want to talk about HER. About how she liked doing her crosswords, drinking coconut water and cooking. I want to be able to look at a new recipe we try and say \u201cWow Grandma M would have really liked this!\u201d.

How dare she? Even typing this pissed me off. So I\u2019ve kept quiet, because my dad sided with her. \n\nI\u2019m currently living at her old house with my uncle. My dad lived here for a bit after their passing but moved and rarely comes back, I\u2019ve learned through other people he can\u2019t deal with the memories here and my other uncle comes around every week for a bit but also can\u2019t stand here too long. I\u2019m the opposite -  this house is like a warm hug of all the happy memories, the Christmases, Easters, of running with my friends in the yard and learning to read of the first time.

My grandfather decided he didn't want to pursue treatment and would go into hospice. \n\nI made arrangements to take some vacation time and go see him.

I was born on her 30th. (Exactly one month after my husbands birthday)  A month later she gets diagnosed with stage 4b ovarian. \nDue of language barriers and because I couldn't think of my mom alone like that I was in every of her appointments.\n\nOur plans for a small wedding got smaller and smaller as the treatment went on and when she had her hysterectomy surgery done, the follow up chemo session was was set for my husbands and I anniversary/wedding date. \n\nHusband and I wanted to elope anyways. So, a week after my moms surgery, she was up and dolled up. We got someone to officiate the wedding and we married in her apartment. \n\nShe was doing so good and hopeful until the\n turn of the year. We thought it was a virus.. I had gotten sick too so I hadn't see her as frequently. \nAfter that hospitalization things went downhill\n \nAround February or March I saw the big change in my moms personality. They had  given me a booklet at the hospital. About how when a person starts the dying stages. \n\nI convinced my mom to let her mom and sister visit her. She forgave them. (Unfortunately they brought useless stupid drama,  fortuantely, after her death.)\nI got know her a lot more after dealing with her family, her mom, as an adult and I understand her better.. and I wish I could tell her. That inderstand why she the way she was.\n\nFinally, after a big struggle to get my sister a humanitarian Visa, she made it to my mom. The Visa was for 7 days, but 2 of those days were used up traveling via bus. \nBut she made it. The day before her Visa expired my mom started to sleep more and more. \nShe only had to overstay for 7 days. \n\nIt was nearing midnight, and typically I would go home to my husband and be back in the morning.  It was so hard to leave my mother, but my husband and dog were and are my only comfort in this world.\nThat day, I stayed with my sister in the living room while my dad slept on the side of the hospice bed. My mom breathing had become more haggard and she hadnt spoken in 2 days.\n\nMy sister was laying down the bedsheets while I had just laid down  in the couch and had grabbed my phone to text my husba happy birthday as it just has turned midnight. \n\nI didnt even hit send when I heard my mother, she couldnt talk but we heard her voice and immediately we ran to her. \nHer breathing was so harsh, so slow, but we knew and we sat there with her, telling her to let go and see her dad who had just passed 3 months earlier. I dont what else I said, but I just knew I wanted her to be free. \n\nI was the one in charge of stuff so i immediately  go out the room to let the nurse know. When I come back in the room, she had a smile on her face. Previously her mouth was open and pretty much locked when my dad had try getting her head in a more comfortable position the day before. \n\nAfter that, it's like a haze. \nMy sister went back and two months later my dad could stand being in the apartment and this country alone and he moves back to our native country. \n\nThe funny thing about my mom dying on my husbands birthday (funny ok word to use?) is that my mom was the kind that did not like being a bother. She had an awful MIL and mom when it came to her relationship with my dad, she made sure she did not do the same. So two or three weeks before she died she told me fo make sure I do something for my husbands birthday, at least take to out to eat, something to appreciate how wonderful he'd been. (He physically helped her on certain occasions, as well as always being supportive)\n\nSo now here I am, 2 weeks away from my husbands birthday again. \n\nWe've made plans to go camping I wanted to get him a watch. Make his day special.  But thanks to my inability to work full shifts and think of the future because im stuck inside brain, I've ended up with smaller checks and no real plans. I think we can still make a day trip to a lake or river maybe.\n\nas the time has gotten closer, he avoids mentioning her, I think to maybe not hurt me? \nI dont want to be bummed out on his day either,\nBut I miss my mom so much. I'm sure he feels some sort of upset about sharing his birthday but of course he would never say that to me. \nI have no one near me I can talk about her. I understand why people get awkward about death, it's scary and it's a whole nother world we like to pretend it doesnt exist. \n\nHelp is the most obvious answer. But group counseling seems entirely too social and therapist is out of my budget. \n\nI dunno, I think typing all this out for an hour is just as helpful and cheaper.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

She had suffered a slew of health problems for about 10 years. She was only 54. \n\nMy mother raised me to care for people. We were caregivers to my very sick grandparents while I grew up, starting with me literally babysitting my grandfather after a major heart attack and triple bypass at 4 years old because I could call 911 if he keeled over. \n\nShe was also a home health nurse. During the summers she took me to her client homes, and taught me how to take vital signs.  She even had me (10years old) soothe a clients wife as her husband (unbeknownst to me or the wife)died in their bedroom. \n\nMy grandparents really took advantage of my mother\u2019s inability to say no and on top of a 40 hour work week, raising me, and having a farm, she cared for them daily for much of my childhood. My father hated her spending so much time and money on them. So it was a constant stress to her. She always told me to put her in a nursing home when she got \u201clike that.\u201d \n\nOnce I was grown she fled our home town to a swamp four hours away so she could get away from her parents. We weren\u2019t extremely close  due to her being an alcoholic, emotionally abusive shitbag during my teen years and I didn\u2019t go see her much. We eventually became closer in the past 6 years or so, and after her mother died November 2017 we got very close and talked every day on the phone. (I live across the country) \n\nWe knew she wasn\u2019t going to have a great long life. Smoking and drinking had taken their toll on her body. She had COPD and Polycythemia (like leukemia but manageable with regular treatment) so we had often talked of what she wanted if she ended up on life support, how she wanted to be cremated etc. \n\nEvery night I was scared it would be my last time to talk to her though. She wasn\u2019t treated well by the swamp doctors and we could tell it was all getting harder for her. I was wondering about bringing her up to New England to be in a home near me. \n\nAnd then ten days on life support and I had to tell her goodbye. I had to tell them to let her die. I was her daughter, her friend, and ultimately her reaper. \n\nThere\u2019s a million other things I could say about everything that has happened but the short of it is, she\u2019s dead and I\u2019m grieving but maybe not enough? It was hard the first month and I can certainly work myself up now, but I\u2019m already feeling better and I feel guilty. Maybe still in shock? Or maybe our relationship was so long distance that it\u2019s not as hard... I don\u2019t know. \n\nI\u2019m glad she wouldn\u2019t let me care for her because I would have, but we would have hated each other. We were great phone friends but in person we couldn\u2019t get on for long. \n\nBut another part of me is like, HOW could you raise me to be a caregiver and then run away when you needed it back? I feel guilty for not feeling guilty about insisting she let me help more. She kept telling me to live my life and take care of my kid and husband. It\u2019s what she said she wanted but not what she raised me to do. \n\nNow I don\u2019t worry every day that she will burn herself up with a dropped cigarette, or fall down the stairs and suffer alone until she dies or a million other concerns of horrible tragic death. \n\nI was with her, she didn\u2019t die alone, and I\u2019m so grateful. She was scared to die for most of my life. But I found out she knew she was going to really die for the last month of her life and she let her health go unchecked. She wanted to die. \n\n\n\nTL;DR Mom raised me to care for people, moved away so I couldn\u2019t care for her, and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m feeling grief enough.

The night before he passed we had a fight and he threw a beer bottle at me and the glass shattered all around my feet.

I was and still am deeply devastated that he decided taking is own life was something he needed to do to be free from his depression. I\u2019m not sure what point I am trying to make. I just have been having a hard time lately. Images of his body flash into my head a lot and I\u2019ll think about where our relationship went so wrong. I remember red flags that should have signaled me to leave sooner. I feel guilt about not calling 911 when he first mentioned having suicidal thoughts. Just everything in our relationship was a mess and he didn\u2019t leave a note. I saw the corners exam results and his time of death was about an hour before I woke up to go to work.

He sounded so good. Told me all about his job, that he was always the first one to arrive. Said it was hard work, but his dedication was observed and was already moving up. His plan was to go to officer camp and join the army. He had his BA in psychology, and was going to use the GI bill to get his masters. He was so proud of himself and had come so far. I was so hopeful and took a deep exhale. \n\nHe asked if he could come by my work that night since his girlfriend was out of town. (I work at a hotel bar) but I was doing a private event and wouldn\u2019t have been able to chat. I said to come next week, he said that my work had the best French fries, which is adorable in itself. He asked if he could be a bridesmaid in my wedding (which was exactly two months away) which made me laugh. He said \u201cguys do it all the time now!\u201d And said he was excited and had picked out what he was going to wear. I told him I loved him before we got off the phone.\n\nThis was a complete 180 from his life even six months ago. He started with OxyContin, which inevitably lead to heroin. There was years of lies, theft, isolation. He only smoked heroin until our mother passed unexpectedly on Christmas Eve 2016. That changed everything. Started to shoot up, stole thousands and thousands from my dad, a lot of turmoil. My dad enabled his since we were all grieving after losing our mom so suddenly. It was a mess. I tried to get him into treatment, methadone, Suboxone. He denied he had a problem. \n\nOddly enough I was addicted to heroin from 19-25, he was one of the members of my family that begged me to stop, and I started with methadone and treatment/therapy. It completely changed my life and I have been clean for years.\n\nBut he started to be honest around the beginning of last year. Admitted he had a problem, said he wanted to stop, started taking subs. I was cautiously optimistic, but it really did seem like he was turning his life around. He made time to see family, spent more time with my dad, was open about his struggle and how he didn\u2019t want to do it anymore. His eyes were clear and bright, he had energy and enthusiasm. \n\nHe was supposed to come and see my dad that Sunday, November 19th. He couldn\u2019t get ahold of him. That was typical before, but not now. I called/texted to no avail, so I went to his apartment. His phone was there when we used find my iPhone. I knew in my heart we lost him. I didn\u2019t have a key, so I called the landlord and the cops. My brother had a pit bull we could hear barking. The police officers said that if the dog threatened them they would have to put the dog down, to add insult to injury. I said I would get the dog so they could go in the apartment. Once his dog saw me, she ran to the bedroom where he was. He in his bed, no longer alive. That image will never leave me. I got the dog and collapsed outside screaming. I had my dad on speakerphone because he wanted to know what was going on. He knew without me telling him. I couldn\u2019t talk, couldn\u2019t breathe. This should not be happening, cannot be happening. Other than seeing my mother\u2019s body, it was the worst day of my life. They did not find any drug paraphernalia. \n\nThe next 2 months were a blur, I could barely get out of bed let alone complete all my wedding stuff. We found out he passed away from a pulmonary embolism. He also had deep vein thrombosis and acute pneumonia. They all stemmed from heroin abuse. \n\nEveryone assumed it was an overdose. It wasn\u2019t, and that made it so much more heartbreaking. My wedding was a blur, if I could do it again I would have given myself more time. I drank tequila to dumb the pain of him and my mom not being there. I think about him everyday.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Exclusively breastfeeding my beautiful 2 1/2 month old baby boy and playing with my 3 1/2 year old daughter had been rough that weekend and tons of activities and appointments with no help as my partner was working a lot had taken its toll on me. (Not that he helped much anyway, as I found out at the hospital with police that he had been using crystal meth behind our backs). \n\n\n\nI laid down to feed my boy after my daughter had been dropped off 2 hours away at her dads for the week (better schools in his area and he and I are still very close so we had a unique custody plan) at 11pm. We\u2019d done professional photos, shopped, played, visited family, they\u2019d had me up at 4:30am all weekend. I was DEAD tired. His crib had broken so we were cosleeping until the new one arrived the coming Saturday. We snuggled up to breastfed and I fell asleep. My partner woke me up at 12am and took the baby from his \u201csafe\u201d position with me and I instructed him to watch him and put him in his swing while I caught up on some rest for a couple hours. (I say \u201csafe\u201d because now I believe no form of cosleeping is safe.) Apparently that was too much to ask because he laid him back in the bed with me while I was completely asleep in a totally unsafe manner. He checked on us 2 hours later and our little man had flipped over, asphyxiated and wasn\u2019t breathing. Cue desperate CPR, paramedics arrived, they worked for an hour and we lost him at 3:24am. I was so beyond devastated. My world imploded in that moment. I\u2019ll never be right. I discovered my fianc\u00e9\u2019s meth abuse had also entered my system as \u201ccontact\u201d.

I just couldn't see myself doing that about someone who died that I rarely spoke to in the couple+ years toward the end, even if we were close activity-wise or emotionally a couple years in college.\n\nNot trying to have some closeness competition on who was closest to my friend. Just can't stand people putting up illusions, esp publicly. I know how lonely my friend was when I wasn't available. I know they spoke with people from college occasionally in a blue moon, as did they with my friend. I was there to see how often they relied on me because of how reliable and there I was for them and because they killed themself, it just makes me angrier when someone tries to manipulate the perception of how close they were in the end. If they really had the level of friendships they've been pretending to have had with them since they died, I never would've heard from my friend as often and had to step in to help as much as I did. I bore the brunt of all that for years, gladly and often with initiative. I'm still not out there trying to get recognition for it. That would just be disrespectful, tacky, and selfish.\n\nEdit: some structure/spelling", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I believe much was due to so much of my childhood revolving around feelings which has led me to feel too strongly and caused me to become a highly sensitive person. I rebelled in 7th grade, blocked off all of my feelings and became the class clown/bad kid to protect myself and try to fit in. 25 years later I believe it has all caught up to me and I feel like I am going to explode with sadness, frustration, anger and depression.  I have spent my entire life masking feelings with humor and a notion of nothing being serious.  I decided to take nothing seriously because I couldn't handle my feelings associated with anything I wasn't making fun of or masking with sarcasm. I am starting to come to the notion that my personality has been made up and that I am a complete phony however I never felt this way when I wasn't depressed.  I believe that I invented the \"funny guy\" personality as a protective measure in 7th grade and never strayed away since. I also have extreme ADHD and was never able to do well in school or behave at all which also led to my rebellion against the world. I've abused alcohol most of my life to cope, have gotten into dozens of fist fights and actually ended up in jail a few times for 180 collective days.  Fortunately, jail scared the shit out of me and I have avoided drunken aggressive, violent behavior for the most part over the past 5 years. I have legitimate PTSD from being in jail. I think about it everyday and it has made me paranoid and consumed by fear. I feel however that it is boiling up inside of me and ready to unload in an awful manner the next time I get really drunk while dealing with the feelings of my father dying from cancer. I've stayed sober for a year a couple of times but cannot stand the softness and vulnerability of AA. I cannot survive in the real world holding hands and saying \"it works if you work it\" everyday.  The real me is just a sad, depressed soul who manifests his sadness into anger in order to get by in the world.  This society does not take well to sad men hence I believe I have fallen victim to toxic masculinity. The real me just wants to die but I have to maintain strength for my family and people who care about me.  I've been isolating from society for many years out of fear I will lose all of my friends and most of my other friends respect again after being a drunken disaster and going to jail. I only drink beer now however I am ashamed of doing so because I know I shouldn't be drinking. I ran with a very bad crowd growing up and have constant shame of whom I chose as friends and am scared that they will call/text mean things because I no longer keep in touch with them which some have. I wish I weren't so sensitive. I used to pretend I didn't care about anything which worked well for me until I could no longer repress my feelings. I am no longer the person who I pretended to be for so long. My father dying and the guilt/shame he will never see me settled and doing well is hitting me like a ton of bricks. I am single in my late 30's with no kids and currently no real job that holds me accountable.  I was supposed to start a new job last week that I chickened out of after having a massive anxiety attack. I'm in a relationship with a woman who is getting married later this year. WTF has my life come to?  I am jealous whenever I see happy people and/or go on social media every blue moon to see all of my friends seemingly happy with kids with their lives together.  It's these days, I wish that I were religious or able to find god.\n\nI just moved in with 2 friends so hopefully having company around will help in addition to the antidepressant I started taking a week ago. I'm terrified that I am going to have a really bad drunken episode soon because of how disgusted I am with where I am in my life.  Then, maybe I will be forced to go to jail, rehab or the mental ward. I'm ready to revert back to the old bad me because I can't deal with my hurt anymore.

That was, according to them, as hard as expected.\n\nHer paternal grandad is also ill, he's had heart problems for years now. \n\nIn recent months, her maternal grandparents have deteriorated completely to the point where one or both of them could literally go at any moment. Over the last week they've refused all possible care, transferal to a nursing home or hospital, and help from any of us. Essentially they WILL both die at home in the next week or so.\n\nIf that wasn't bad enough, her parents just this second got a call that her paternal grandad has just (about fifteen minutes before I started writing this) fallen very unwell, and all I know is he has also refused hospitalisation in the event that he goes into cardiac arrest, so now he too is in a situation where he could die any day now.\n\nBottom line: 3/4 of her grandparents are in all likelihood going to die in the next week or two at most.\n\nBasically, I've never experienced a bereavement so don't know what to do with this situation at all.

They're more resigned to it all than anything else. My girlfriend for sure definitely seems to be way further on the \"Old people die, stuff happens\" side of things than I thought.\n\nEven so, she says herself that this will just be a lot of grief hitting her at once. I've only met all three of these grandparents two or three times each, so it won't affect me at all other than a few days of sadness at the fact that it's happened. I'm just terrified of the coming months, my girlfriend and I are both at the same university (we're older than most students and are living together in the town where our uni is) and my nightmare is the possibility of this sudden event that is external to our relationship changing our position and way of life so much that something happens to us.\n\nIt's all a massive mix of worrying about her, worrying how it will affect our relationship, and worrying about all of this coming at a time when we both have responsibilities and things to do (our degrees, paying for living i.e. food etc, and staying a happy couple). This much grief at once can only have a massive negative impact on SOMETHING, namely my partner of course, but I'm also worried about other ramifications that I might not even aware of right now.\n\nAll I can ask is: What can I expect, and what should I do?\n\nThank you so much for your time.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I would give her a kiss and a hug and ask that she hang on, tell her that she was a good girl and that I loved her and that I hope she wouldn\u2019t suffer much longer. She couldn\u2019t use her paws on one side of her body and she was having difficulty breathing. They decided it was time to let her go when her breathing got really difficult three Sundays ago. It was the right decision. She wasn\u2019t going to get better and each day she was suffering more and more. She couldn\u2019t do the things she used to love. I remember when she would run through the open fields in the park near our house. She loved being free. She loved to run as fast as she could from one end of the field to the other with us chasing after her. She never needed a ball to chase, she just loved the grass under her paws and the fresh air against her fur. She loved the smells. She smelled the wind, she smelled the earth, but mostly she liked to use her nose like a detective, following an invisible world I couldn\u2019t see in which she found traces of other dogs. I don\u2019t know what they told her but she liked to listen and leave her own message. Jamie helped me through a time when I didn\u2019t think I could it take anymore. She helped me see the joy in simple things. Taking naps, walking, going to the park or the forest, being by the lake, watching her chase ducks, playing with her, petting her, feeling her soft fur and looking into her large brown eyes. Her eyes were expressive, her eyebrows even more so. She used to breathe with her pink tongue hanging comically out of her mouth when she was her happiest. I miss the way she smells, the way she greeted us dramatically at the door and the way she sighed loudly in her sleep. I miss the joy she brought me and the joy I brought her. Sometimes the sadness of her loss seems like too much to bare. First Benedict, now Jamie. It\u2019s been six weeks since my rabbit Benedict died. He got sick so quickly and I wasn\u2019t there to help him. I can\u2019t go down that road now though. It's too much. I just know I miss them both terribly and I don\u2019t know what else to do.

In the last few months, grief symptoms have been hitting me hard, and I didn't even know what it was. For the last few weeks I have been very depressed and anxious, have been crying about it every day, and just can barely manage myself out of bed to go to school. It was just never this bad before. I only have so many people I can talk to about this and it felt good to type it out idk. I'll never be okay with what happened to him.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I'm keeping this somewhat vague and using a random account because I feel ashamed of how pathetic it feels to me. I just wanted to describe what's happening and see if anyone else has had this experience. Maybe there's some rational, effective way to navigate it. TL;DR: I'm tricking myself into thinking I sense my dead lover's \"spirit\" in a somewhat random person I don't know, and the shame and anxiety from this leaves my body in a state of physical terror.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lost someone I was deeply in love with over a year ago. I had a few weeks of what I would have expected as \"normal\" grief (denial, isolation, crying all the time, binge drinking, other unhealthy and some healthy coping mechanisms). Then it felt like my body just shut down all the healthy grief outlets (like crying/processing - I've always had trouble expressing emotions) so that I could continue on with everyday life. It was weird and unsettling but I think the body/mind tries to protect the heart sometimes by just closing everything off, if that makes sense. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, a few weeks ago I started having dreams about him again. I have two types of dreams about him now: 1) in which he and I are either together in some alternate realm (\"the afterlife\") laughing and being sweet and cuddly with each other, and actually discussing the circumstances of his death as if they were some hilarious, fabricated joke that had happened to someone else; and 2) in which he is miraculously alive again in another body, and I can somehow sense his spirit in this new person and know it's actually him for some reason that only makes sense in the dream. I hate and love these dreams because they're the only time I get to see him and touch him, and they feel SO chillingly real, but I feel like it can't be healthy to fixate like this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe actual weird part: A couple weeks ago I saw someone that my body/emotions are telling me is him in another body. Yes, I rationally understand that that's insane and not possible. I feel an intense, physical, absolutely impossible-to-ignore reaction to/inexorable pull toward this person. I just found out his name, I've barely spoken to him, and I know next to nothing about him. We see each other in passing in class a couple times a week. The feeling in my body when I see him or expect to be around him feels like absolute terror mixed with little-girl-crush: my heart rate skyrockets, my stomach clenches and I feel nauseated, my breathing gets shallow and labored, I feel my face and neck get hot, and I feel like I can't even speak because my voice would be shaking and unnaturally high. The couple times I've exchanged words (like, 8 words total, no exaggeration) with him, I've felt like I was gonna vomit or laugh hysterically or cry. I don't know how to make sense of this intense physical reaction other than that I'm wishing my dead lover back to life through delusional dreams, and my non-rational self wants this to be true so badly that I'm assigning his spirit and essential self to this new person. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHas anyone else experienced something like this? This person also seems to want to be near me (body language, other cues) for whatever reason, so I feel like completely ignoring him and pretending I'm not screaming internally in his presence would be extremely difficult. And part of me doesn't want to do that, maybe because I do want him to be the embodied soul of a dead person I love? To put it bluntly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so creepy and weird. I am also happily in a new relationship, and I REALLY don't want to talk about this with my boyfriend. I wouldn't want to hear about it if I were him, and this feels like something that's entirely in my mind that I need to figure out without putting it on him as well.

Might not be the most \"structured\" text but oh well. \n\n10 Months ago, I lost my boyfriend to suicide. We had been together for 2 years, living in a different state from our families. I'm now 24, and he was about to turn 30.He hung himself 2 weeks after I took him to the hospital after he confessed about being suicidal. I found him one night after work.\nLong story short... He had PTSD. I always tried to get him to get counseling, and he always tried to get better without it. He never accepted any help. He accepted that he was struggling, sometimes even agreeing to seeing someone, only to change his mind the next day. But I never thought his life would end up the way it did. I knew he was suffering... And it was horrible to watch. But I never thought he would commit such a cruel gesture. \nI was getting better. I had just moved back to the city we were living in, ready to be away from my family again. I finally understood why I was holding on to life like I blindly did for the past 10months. Things started to make sense again, life wasn't so heavy all the time. Not only could I enjoy the fun and stupid moments I could have with friends/collegues, life just seemed like maybe it would start to be fair again.\n\n3 weeks ago, my close friend and roomate hung himself. I got woke up by the sound of his girlfriend screaming and crying. I thought they had gotten into a fight, I was very tired and still waking up. Until my friend came into my room and said not to come out, because our buddy was hanging outside the front porch.\nHe and my boyfriend we're friends. I remember him telling me how much his death affected him. \nBut we never thought his life would end the same way. We came to know he had a history of psychosis, and that he had tell a few people during the past year that he had suicidal thoughts. But nothing like my boyfriend showed.\nSince last week, nothing makes sense. I've seen a therapist for the last 8 months, but I stopped seing him since I moved back from my parent's city. I know it would help to go see one again, but I feel like I'm just slowly getting out of denial now because it didn't seem necessary before now. \n\nThe last 2 days have been really hard. I don't want to die. And I'm not in extreme suffering or anything. I just feel like I've lost the little bit of clarity I had. I feel empty. I feel extremely tired and small. I just want a fucking break, I just want to be like everybody else that I see when I drive around town and stop for gas. Not that I'm mad or jealous of them. I just wish life would stop fucking with the mental health of the people I loved most. ( oh cause yeah, my mother's bipolar and my brother's had depression and anxiety for all my teenage and young adult life now. )\nI don't know what I'm seeking exactly by posting this here... But I think I want to make sure I'm not the only #deep person who wish she wasn't so #deep ( yes Bo Burnham reference I'm tired. Also yes lots of dark humor coping mechanism to survive ever since so a lil' joke is always welcomed :D..... :(", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Why?", "author": "rubyyy95", "self_text": "**trigger warning- sucide**\nHi everyone, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, so please redirect me if it's not.\n\nIn October 2016 my (23F) grandpa completed suicide by driving head on into a truck. He tried to take my grandma with him so she was also in the car. She had horrible injuries and spent months and months in hospital. Thankfully, she survived and is doing okay, considering what happened. I have always been really close with my grandparents so this was a really terrible thing to have happen.\n\nSince about 3 weeks after it happened, I've found that I really struggle to feel sadness about my grandpa being dead. I consciously know I care, but I literally feel nothing while thinking about it. I feel sad that he got to the point that he thought what he did was an option, but that's it. Most of my emotions towards it are directed towards my nan and how horrible everything she went through (and is still going through) is.\n\nI was wondering if anyone else feels like this? Or why I would feel like this? I know these are pretty unique circumstances so I don't know of anyone could relate directly, but I feel really messed up for not having any emotions about my grandpa dying. I literally can't even cry about it if I want to. The feeling is just not there.\n\nIt might be helpful to add that I have a history of trauma, and I know that has an impact on the way your brain processes things.\n\nAny insight or advice would be helpful :)", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I know this sounds stupid and ridiculous but I was young, I was 14 discovering parts of me. I turned out to be bisexual. I just remember being so obsessed with him but at the same time, I wanted to be like him when I grow up. I wanted to have body like him, his haircut, the way he talk; he had a scar on his stomach and I remember wanting one too. I remember searching for his history. And now that he's dead. I dont know if Im grieving or not. I guess it was unexpected. And everytime I hear myself read the sentence that he's dead, it takes me back to those days and it makes me tremble because I just cant believe that hes dead. Hes not in this world anymore. I stopped watching his videos but he remains to be in my mind when I stumble upon videos of straight film. I cant believe that a random guy like him would have a big impact on me, but then again he helped me shaped myself. I just... maybe its the fact that I will never get to see (in this case, an read an update) about him again. I felt the same way when one of my classmates died. And nobody is taking me seriously, my friends are just brushing it off. Is this valid to feel? Am I allowed to feel this way? And the way he died. Its so tragic.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Apparently, him and mom where having couples therapy and had write and share stuff on a daily basis, around different subjects. I couldn't help but read my dad's entries.\n\nI saw my early childhood through his eyes and his words. His pride in me, in his fatherhood. How he wanted me to grow up and be all I wanted to be. It soothed me at that time.\n\nMy dad was always super protective of me - understandable in his situation as I was the only happy thing to happen for him in his relationship with mom. He always supported me in everything I did, even when he wasn't agreeing with me. Words of encouragement, money, advice. He was always there. \n\nHe worried about my work, because I have a weird career path and I change jobs every 2-3 years, whilst he worked in the same industry for 40 years. But in the last year or so, he was feeling confident in where I was in life. Like \"bassman1976 is  doing great at work and in life. I don't need to worry anymore\".\n\nHe helped my wife and I get our place - he signed up his home equity as a collateral on the house so we didn't have to take our savings for a cashdown. \"I don't want to give you guys the money straight ahead, but this will help you and you'll keep your savings\". He did the same last year when we completely renovated the house.\n\nHe couldn't get out of the house anymore that much, but everytime I visited, I would show him the plans, pictures of the progress. He was stoked that we'd have a \"new place\"\n\nIn the fall, he told me he had 2 things on his bucket list. Cleaning out the garage so I don't have to when he's gone, and come see the renovated house. He didn't get to do any of those things. \n\nThe other thing he was looking forward...My dad was a car enthusiast. I honestly cannot remember all the cars he drove. At one point, we had 7 cars at the house, for 3 drivers. My mom's, mine, and 5 for Dad...So when I started telling him about electric cars and the fact that my wife and I were looking into one...he was all ears. Two weeks after he passed, we put a deposit on a Kona EV. We will get it at the end of the month. He won't see it.\n\nBut in a weird way - and I know that it is easy to link two things together when there's no connection - I think he knows and approves.\n\nLast week, I was driving my wife's car from detailing, going through the numbers of the upcoming new car in my head, and I was starting to question our decision. It's a $50K+ vehicle before incentives and whatnot...It's not like buying shoes or whatever. So I was wondering if we made the right call on that when an 80's 2-tone green Ford Econoline merged on the road I was driving on, the kind of vehicle that you don't see that often on the road. Also one of the few vehicles that stand out in my dad's ever revolving roster of cars. He drove one like that for a few years and everybody in the extended family knows about and remembers the \"EnviroBus\", as we called it. \n\nThe Ford drove alongside me until I made a turn to go back home. And I thought that in a way, Dad was telling me that I had made the good choice.\n\n\\---\n\nIn a weird way, I feel more confident now than when he was still living. Because I know I don't have him to fall back on anymore. That I'm on my own now. \n\nIt's been 3 months, I miss him to death. Monday's gonna be his first birthday without him. I plan on starting a new tradition for that. The week after will be my birthday as well. My first without my dad and his weird phone call. \n\n\"Hey it's me\" (Me....WHO'S ME? But only him said that...)\n\n'Hey dad!\"\n\n\"Happy birthday big guy\"\n\n\"Thanks dad\".\n\n\"I'm giving the phone to mom, bye\"\n\n\"bye dad\".\n\nThen he would yell from across the room, while mom spoke to me, to tell me everything he forgot to tell me...", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I was shaking and hysterically crying but I knew I was able to get a hold of my dad at work (I worked at the same place for 14 years).\n\nMy sister and I hung up the phone, both in shock and crying and my SO (who woke up during the commotion of my disbelief and sobbing about my mom) and I walked out to our patio so I could smoke. SO and I were both sobbing.  A woman who I've seen walk by our place many times happened to stop and looked at him and asked if we were ok. He said, \"we just found out her mom died in a car accident this morning\". The woman (who I've never spoken to in my life)  walked up to our patio and held out her arms and asked me for a hug. I needed one and she prayed while I cried in her arms. \n\nI told the woman (who was talking about something that I don't remember) that I'm sorry, but I had to get a hold of my dad because he didn't yet know.  She continued talking about whatever she was, and my dad finally called me at 8:57 AM AZ time. \n\nI did not break the news gracefully, and I will never forget the pain in my Dad's voice when he realized what I was saying. They had been married 47 years. They have five kids and ten grandkids. \n\nA few hours later, my SO said, \"Do you realize that was probably your mom sending that lady to give you a hug and pray for you?\" I laughed and said the lady even rambled on after I told her I couldn't talk, just like my mom did. \n\nI do think she was there that first morning. I've had a beautiful dream about her too. \n\nI just miss her so much. For whatever reason, today has been particularly rough, after the last two days of being relatively \"ok\". The part that sucks is that this is how I have to live for the rest of my life. I know I will manage, but for now, I just don't know how I'm going to do that. \ud83d\ude2d", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Our society puts such an emphasis on getting back to normal, never stopping for anything, but that doesn\u2019t work for everyone. For me it was too hard to move for such a long time, months and months, and it\u2019s still a problem. I didn\u2019t clean my room or do laundry for ages. I didn\u2019t eat or drink water enough. The sadness causes pains in my body that makes it hard to move, I think. It\u2019s hard to go out and be social with people and I really have to convince myself to do it. So I just want to let everyone know, if you need to rest, do it. Don\u2019t feel bad if you say no to social engagements. If you do any extra activities, try to ask for a break for a while. Try to stay home from work for some time. I only got a few days off work when my dad passed away and when I came back, my boss was right there talking a huge long list of information at me, when I could barely process anything at the time. If someone can make you food, let them. That\u2019s really helpful. This is our bodies and minds telling us to slow down from life and take that time to focus on our pain and on healing from it. Even after the last sympathy card comes in, sometimes we still need a really long time to rest and recover. Our society can go at such a frenetic pace. Remembrance and grieving is a slow process that doesn\u2019t get along well with picking up and going back to work, acting like everything is fine. I just hope this might help people who have just lost someone close to them.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

As a result, I grew up only seeing my grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins for a few weeks every other year, if I was lucky. My cousin C (m28) was my favorite on my mom's side when we were younger, because he was a sweetheart and didn't exclude me for being a girl like our older cousin. C's father, my uncle B (59), has always been sort of the black sheep of the family (borrowing money, living beyond his means, etc.), but as a single father he did *everything* for C.\n\nWhen he was around 18, C started showing signs of schizophrenia. He became a bit of a recluse, and we were lucky if we saw him once during our trips to see family, which became more frequent as I got older and could afford my own ticket. A year or two ago, B quit his job and became C's fulltime caregiver. He moved the two of them to the countryside (a several-hour drive away), since the close quarters in the city aggravated C's illness. C loved it there, apparently. \n\nIn January, on a Thursday at about 1 AM, my mother (60) woke me up (live at home, high cost of living), sobbing, and my immediate thought was that my grandmother (85 and suffering from strokes and dementia) had passed. It was the biggest shock of my life to hear that no, Nan was fine, but B had gone to wake C and found him cold in his bed.\n\nThat morning/night was the worst of my life. I couldn't get back to sleep. I stayed up with my mom while she called my brother (26 and living with his gf) to tell him, and when she called my aunts, and when she called B. I listened to the despair in his voice as he spoke to my mom. I listened later, when my mom told me he had tried to call my aunt D for help, but she had kept ignoring his calls because he owed her money and she was annoyed with him. I listened as mom explained how worried she was about B, because C was his entire world, and he was hours away from the family, with only the police and his dogs for company.\n\nI stayed with mom for the entire day, and my brother came over and stayed, too. I think we both knew without saying that she needed us there to see that we were all right.\n\nIt took days to get an autopsy done. Cause of death was determined to be pneumonia, which floored me. For a few weeks, I was scared to sleep because I already had a mild fear of dying in my sleep. My dad told me he had looked in on me a few times, for his own peace of mind.\n\nMom flew to England once plans were made for the funeral. I didn't get to go, and the separation while my mom was away made my fears worse.\n\nC was amazing. He played soccer in high school and was good enough at it to be a prospect for professional teams. He had a strong sense of justice and hated pedophiles in particular (which factored in to his illness). He had two older half-siblings and was a wonderful uncle, himself. He was a gentle giant (probably 6'7\") and even in his illness, I don't think he hurt a fly. I don't exactly miss him - he wasn't enough a part of my life for him to miss.\n\nMy heart aches so much because I'm thinking of B, whose entire world came crashing down. He's living my worst nightmare. He won't move back to the city (with the rest of the family and his support structure) because he wants to stay in the place my cousin loved. I want be there for him, but at the same time, I'm afraid that I'll do more harm than good - closest in age to his son of all his niblings, and the daughter of the sibling closest in age to him. I'm worried that he'll look at me and think of how C should be almost my age.\n\nStill, I wish I could have gone to C's funeral.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He gave his condolences and they were heartfelt because he actually knew her and we shared a couple of memories about her. I have no problem with this, I find it quite lovely actually, just to see how one person can touch many.\n\nBut another time, I met one of my partner's childhood friends and the conversation went like this:\n\nMe: Oh yeah I used to go rock climbing with my dad sometimes. We went to X location a lot actually, it was pretty fun.\n\nHer: Do you guys still do that? I know my dad prefers to sit at home and watch the match.\n\nMe: Nah, he passed almost a year ago. I've gone a few times with [partner] though.\n\nHer: I'm so sorry for your loss, that must be so difficult!\n\nThe way I mentioned his passing was casual if anything. I wasn't on the verge of tears or gave any indication that this was something I desperately wanted to discuss. I remember frowning a little and looking over at my partner before saying \"So you work as X, my friend does too, what's that like?\". She looked a little confused for a second before continuing on with this trail of thought.\n\nI sound like such a bitch I know, but I honest to God don't understand why someone would think I'd want to have such an intimate discussion with someone I barely know. It's so bizarre to me but maybe it's just a thing where I'm from?\n\nThoughts?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

We would always make a trip to a town about 45 minutes away and get fresh kielbasa, dye eggs, bake kifli (butter cookies with fruit in the middle....I feel like every culture has a version of these) and, even at 30, my husband and I would get Easter baskets filled with candy and little gifts and we would eat candy and kielbasa before church.\n\nThis year, I don't know what to do. I know that Easter isn't going to be a really big deal because my husband and I both have to work (I volunteered) and my dad has to work too (thank goodness.) Since I'll be working, I won't even be at church. My question is, did you guys keep your traditions alive after your parent passed? It's Good Friday and I haven't dyed any eggs or bought any kielbasa or candy. One of my girlfriends (who has been practically a family member for years) told me she would come over and help me make the kifli.

I'm wearing your hoodie right now, it was your favorite. What i would give to see you in it again, to hear you laugh while you show me one of those prank videos you found absolutely hilarious on Facebook and start talking about how you want to recreate it and go viral (I never had the heart to tell you that they were fake and those were actors). I was so fortunate to have you for 19 years, you gave me so much and I am enternally grateful to you. I wish I told you that more. \n\nDad, your heart was bigger than your wallet.

I treasure every gift you gave me, the random ones you would bring me home on rare occasions you went to the store after work because you heard me talking about wanting it. I love the batman jacket you got me, the one you saw randomly and got so excited because you had a superman one and wanted us to match. \n\nDad, I wish you could see Top Gun 2 when it comes out. You constantly made me watch Top Gun with you so I could hear you quote all the lines word for word because you loved that movie and Tom Cruise so much. I wish I could hear you do that again. Thank you for getting me into LOTR when I was younger, you opened the door to a whole new world to me and it quickly became my favorite movies. \n\nDad, thank you for trying so hard to share and understand my interests. You always wanted to play the video games I liked and wanted to go to conventions with me, to explore what I loved even if you didnt like it that much. You didnt understand why I loved Harry Potter, but because I loved it you would listen to me ramble and even took the quiz so I could excitedly tell you about your house. You were a Gryffindor, it fit you. And you loved the house colors. \n\nDad, thank you for giving me the best life you could. You were an amazing father and how I wish I responded to the last text you sent me. You were going on a cruise with mom, celebrating your 20th anniversary. I was watching your pets and Nikki, my sweet sister and your youngest daughter, I had just moved out a couple weeks before. You were obsessed with your new thing to lose weight, and you had bone broth in the fridge. I had talked to mom 2 days before, she told me you said not to drink the bone broth. The day of your death, you jokingly texted me not to drink it. I laughed when I saw it and didnt respond, I put my phone in my pocket planning to take a picture with it later saying I was going to drink it all. \n\nNot even 30 minutes later my boyfriend came to my work, he told my manager something serious happened in the family. My manager came and got me, my heart sunk. I tried to convince myself that nothing bad had actually happened, but in my heart I was fearing for you. For some reason, I knew it was about you. He told me you had a heart attack and didnt know if you were going to survive. I broke down at work. I was sent home. I had to tell Nikki, we clung to each other and sobbed uncontrollably. We called your parents, we asked them to come over. They moved down to be closer to you and us, we prayed to God hoping you would be okay. We started to hope that you would be. \n\nYou weren't, and I never got to say goodbye. You died before we could even get to the hospital to see you, and I felt my life shatter. I didnt sleep that night, I couldnt stop crying. Your work shut down for the day of the funeral, they all loved you so much. Everyone wore red to honor you, we all know how much you loved Nebraska. Your Nebraska group even got you Nebraska flowers, it was so nice. \n\nI'll never forget seeing mom cling to my grandfather, holding the shirt you wore that day sobbing. I'll never forget the sounds of those cries, knowing nothing I do will help.

We grew up together for 8 years before my younger brother was born, we'd seen through my parents divorce and their new unstable relationships and the many falling out with family members, he's was truly the only one in my family that really understood me and we were so similar minded in every way. He'd suffered from alcoholism since 17 years old I was 9 then and oblivious to what was going on, as the years went by we got more and more close because I was coming into teenage years, by the last 3/4 years we were inseparable, I told him everything and we would talk every day and discuss what was bothering us and helping eachother sort it out, my parents had a hard time with him and always getting into fights and falling out with him and it really hurt me because I knew he needed them, I know my parents meant so much to him and I could see how hurt he was by them being so set in their ways and giving out to him for how he was or saying to go to rehab (he'd been in rehab 3 times and left at his own will all of those times) I know all he needed was love from them, if for everyone to just love him and help him out but all people seemed to do was give out or drink alongside him which is fucked up if you ask me. He was suffering when he was drinking and he hated alcohol so much but he needed that thing to help him with anxiety and depression and when you live alone and don't love yourself why not spend money you get for being an alcoholic from the government on more drink? He didn't die from the alcohol becsuse the cops told us there was other drugs there and we won't know for months until they test his blood but I know if my brother didn't drink or alcohol wasn't such a goddamn tradition in Ireland he wouldn't have been in that situation and he'd have lived a happy life, he would take drugs to help with withdrawal and I don't mean weed like bad things I never even knew about. I found his reddit a few weeks back and the things he said about what he'd do when he had no alcohol made me sick, to think he was so desperate to feel numb that he'd go to such extents. At Christmas 2018 I had a long talk to him about how every night I sit up crying about how I dont want to loose him and how I really do not want to receive a phonecall about him and that I needed him and he honestly did try I know he wanted to get better and he told me he wanted to but I understood that, I'm in no way mad at him for it but mad at how people deal with alcohol in this country and how people deal with others with mental health, people are dying every day due to alcohol and suicide but everyone just keeps doing the same damn things and it's like as soon as you are of age all you do for occasions is drink and poison yourself. he was 2 months clean when he died but he would have bad days, like all of us and he took something or multiple things to make that day better, he was found just looking like he was sleeping on his couch with a takeaway half eaten in the kitchen, which I later had to throw away and clean from his apartment 3 weeks later. The other day I had a really bad panic attack at night I felt as though my heart was going to stop and my chest was going to close in, I've had panic attacks before but never as bad as this one, my chest hurt for days after. I just feel the sadness so deep in my chest that it makes me nauseous. I just miss him to much and I feel like I'm so alone in missing him because nobody else had the bond we had, he'd told me he tried to commit suicide before but he didn't because he didn't want to leave me alone in this world that he wanted to protect me and my younger brothers, I know he didnt mean to die but I just wish I could swap places with him and let him have a better go at life because it wasn't fair that he had to die at 27, he hadn't got to even enjoy life or see the world he was the whole time trying to fight this horrible disease. I never drank much anyway from when I turned 18 because I wanted to support my brother in showing him that fuck alcohol you can do it sober but now I don't think I can ever even look at alcohol the same, even people in my family went drinking after he was buried, it breaks my heart, how many people have to die from alcohol or alcoholism for us to make a change? It's literally poison and we give it to those who turn 18, they are babies at that age, I'm still a baby, my brother aswell, I wanted to live into my 80s with him and be sitting somewhere on a beach reminiscing about our crazy lives but now I can't and it's just heart crushing. To cope with my grief I'm telling myself that life isn't real its all one big joke or that he is actually \"gone off grid\" as he'd always joke about and just faked his own death I even waited all day April fools day thinkin it would be like him to play a prank on us all, also thinking its all a simulation and I'll see him again but this is just my brain trying to give my broken heart a rest. He was my best friend in the whole world and I'll never ever replace him or forget him or miss him any less. He made me the person I am today and I'm so happy I got to have the time I did with him, I'd relive life over and over and over again forever if it meant id get to see him again, even for a few minutes.

During my darkest moments, i would repeat to myself in my mind \"that x guy on reddit told me it gets better, maybe I will get better too\", and I would feel peace. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not going to share particular details (mostly because I want to forget them), but you may know that I accepted my father's death, my family is starting to rebuild itself, my brother is back at uni and my father had a life-saver secret life insurance that led to a hefty amount of money for me and my brothers. We received it on December. Public education is tuition free in my country, so my sister is using her money to pay for a uni entrance\u00a0test preparation, and I'm no longer feeling compelled to quit uni and start a job to feed them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor people right now struggling with grief, depression, and/or any of the likes, I'm here to tell you what people have told me in the past: IT DOES GET BETTER. I swear, it does. Read my posts, I was on a really dark place, and I'm telling you, there is still hope. Brace yourself, you're on a sinking boat, but although a boat is more convenient when we're at high seas, we still can swim. Never stop swimming!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Thank You. Have wonderful day!", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Someone found him and texted the family a picture of him lying on the ground moments before he died. There was no way for EMS to get there in time. We\u2019d been talking about Indiana Jones literally hours before.\n\nI live abroad and ended up traveling 26 hours to make it to the funeral, the whole flight I spent it crying and wailing, with my spouse trying to comfort me. My spouse\u2019s dad drove us to the airport and I was so angry, that he was alive, that he was older than my dad, that he was never as good a father as mine was, that he asked me \u2018Was he sick?\u2019\n\nA lot of people asked/ask me that. I guess in order to \u2018comfort\u2019 me by telling me \u2018he\u2019s no longer suffering\u2019 but my dad was 100% healthy, and was hiking when this happened.\n\nMy dad was incredible, an excellent father, friend, husband, son, brother, and just all around person. He always made me feel accepted. I\u2019m gay and my family, my mom included, have not been the best about it, but my dad made me feel like my spouse was part of the family, he always made us feel welcome, he always made sure to include them when speaking to me, something everyone else hasn\u2019t done. We visited my hometown together and he was so excited showing off everything he loved about his country to my spouse.\n\nI mentioned the picture because though I have tons of them on my phone, on his that I kept, on my walls, on my computer, my socials, that\u2019s what I see when I close my eyes. That and the feeling that the casket was too small for him. \n\nI dream often about him. In dreams he\u2019s never \u2018dead\u2019, at least not that I know of, until someone, usually my brother, asks him, how come he\u2019s here, body intact, when he was cremated, when an autopsy was performed. At that point I either wake up or he says he\u2019s here because I keep calling him back. I wish this was reality.\n\nMy little sibling died when we were children. Our family dog, a fur sibling, also died suddenly and before his time before I was a teen. When I moved abroad my dad reminded me to never be afraid because my sibling and our dog were always looking after me. My first year abroad\u2014lonely and alone\u2014I had many dreams of the two of them telling me not to worry, they were always with me. I would tell these dreams to my dad and he would get so happy and emotional. He would say \u2018They really are.\u2019 My grandmother reminded me at the funeral that he\u2019s now with them, looking after me, but all I could do is was angrily tell her I wanted him here. I still do.\n\nMany people try to comfort me by telling me my mother has it worse. I have my spouse, I have my furbaby, and she has nothing, and both her children and her siblings live far away. They also tell me to consider my grandparents, who lost a son, whereas I \u2018only lost\u2019 a parent, which follows \u2018the natural order.\u2019 I wish the worst on those people. It angers me so much it\u2019s hard to describe.\n\nI lost my job because I had to take extended leave, considering I was taking a transatlantic flight. So did my spouse. I can\u2019t get another one because I have to return home once again in May, and then July, for the scattering of the ashes and other things. So on top of grief I\u2019ve been dealing with extreme financial strain. My stomachs been a mess.\n\nHis birthday was yesterday. I\u2019d thought I try to do something in his memory but was devastated and out of it all day. Waking up was almost impossible and not till well past noon.\n\nI hope one day things will be a little better. I don\u2019t really see an out here, yet.\n\nTL;DR My dad died in March. I\u2019m dealing with grief and financial stress and things are hard all over. I hope it\u2019ll get better some day.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

It's like being afraid to check your bank account. Knowing you have $25 in there is better than getting your card declined.\n\nMy father had a phone he stopped using about 2 years ago. It's not his most recent one, but he used it a lot. He was never up to date on what was techy so to speak, so he'd always have these funny covers on his phone to protect it. I plugged in this Iphone with a goofy bright orange cover on it and waited for the phone to boot up. There were 3 pictures on the phone. One of my half brother as a little boy. One of him and his girlfriend, and the other of just her.\n\nThe 2 years where he had cancer his girlfriend never shut up about money. She'd complain about driving him to chemotherapy. She'd refuse to sit with him and only take his car so she didn't \"Drive up the miles on hers\". When I got the news my dad was terminal, she wouldn't even give us the privacy of leaving the room. She rolled over next to him in bed and said to me \"You know, yous (She couldn't say you) could NEVER do what I did for your father!\". I guess she meant having a romantic relationship with him or something. It was so infuriating and out of line.\n\nWhen I'd go in to his bedroom to give him IV's of saline, she wouldn't even use the bathroom. I'd have to wait outside of his bedroom while she got changed to party and THEN I could enter. She wouldn't let me enter his bedroom to give him his care until she was done getting ready to part.\n\nI absolutely despise her. I mean, my anger has never been so bad. There's a scene in the Sopranos where Richie gets this HUGE house and Tony is so enraged that he has to walk outside because he's about to faint. That's been my anger now.

She accidentally overdosed on an herbal medicine for diabetes and everything happened within minutes of drinking it. I was with her at the time. She was having a severe seizure so we put her in the car to take to the hospital. She was in my lap when she lost consciousness and died. We were extremely close and I always felt like she was the only person in my family I could talk to that would understand. She was the only person that cared more about me and my happiness than family reputation. \n\nIt\u2019s been almost a year since and something super weird happened today. I was taking a nap around 6:30pm and I dreamt that I saw her again and was talking to her about normal stuff like what I\u2019ve been doing with my life. Then I realized that I was talking to a dead person so i went to my dad (in the dream) and I asked him \u201cWhat is this?\u201d And he said \u201cYou know it\u2019s not really her right, don\u2019t get used to this.\u201d I went back to her and asked \u201cWhy are you lying to me? You\u2019re not real. Are you here to let me say goodbye?\u201d And she didn\u2019t say anything but I hugged her and cried (still in the dream). \n\nIt was a very long hug and we fell to the ground hugging and it was so vivid like I could feel my hands running through her hair but I didn\u2019t feel like it was real. I felt all the physical feelings of the hug just none of the emotions that usually accompany the hugs she used to give me. Then she said something along the lines of okay times up or you\u2019ve had your moment or whatever and I could feel the life slipping out of her again and then she died again on top of me in my arms. \n\nI woke up and tried to move but I was paralyzed mostly I grabbed my phone cuz it was right next to me and I turned it on but I could only see a faint  outline of my phone and the actual screen itself was just a plain gray rectangle. I couldn\u2019t move anything else and I yelled for my dad but he was still out so I just had to wait till I calmed down to move. \n\nI don\u2019t think that was her spirit coming to visit me in my dreams cuz something about the energy was very off. She died on me and I couldn\u2019t move cuz I was pressed down with the weight of my grandmas dead body. Even if it was her soul she wouldn\u2019t do that to me when I\u2019m a dream.

It sounds cliche but it truly does feel like sometimes life is moving around me but I'm still stuck in that time. I barely remember the first month from how numb I was from the grief.  My friends and family watched over me during that time, but once I got home it just felt like everyone could move on so easily. Friends and family asked how I was doing with increasing infrequency, until three months later at Christmas (which was difficult for me), I was asked once by my sister as she was in a rush to feed her baby how I was doing. My sisters and their partners, along with my parents, did their own thing not including me, leaving me to have days alone. Ever since then, people have acted like I should be over it by three months.\n\nNow, I feel like I'm at a point where I feel \"normal\" and not sad all the time, and can talk about it and not cry about it. I can tell someone about it who may have not been in my life prior and I don't get upset or cry. I just have my moments or days when it hurts.\n\nI still don't remember the last time someone asked me how I'm doing with the grief. I think there's this idea that we just \"get over\" the death of someone we love at a certain point. I don't think I'll ever be over it. Especially the way he passed away (diagnosed with terminal cancer at age 23, went from long prognosis to passing away at a year and half into diagnosis), it just feels so unfair. It feels unfair that he hadn't even really started his life yet. He didn't even get a chance at a career, having kids, us progressing our relationship \"normally\". It just makes me so mad and sad at the same time that he had his life taken away from him. Most people get to live a long life before their time comes, and I can't even imagine how that must've felt.\n\nEven now, in a new relationship with someone who I think could be the one, I still cry over him. Every time I go through a life change (like buying my first place, new relationship, new job, all of which has happened since), I struggle because it brings me one more step away from the life I had when he was still alive. You know when someone asks what's new in your life and you say, \"So much!\" and go into detail about it? For me, I imagine someone telling him everything that's happened since he left my life and it just brings me one step away from him.\n\nEven in this new relationship, my new boyfriend has known about my best since the 2nd week into knowing each other. I have been honest with him about the details, but he doesn't seem pressed to know more than the basics. Sometimes I'll try talking to him about it because I just need someone to listen, and he just shuts down and doesn't say anything. I ask what he thinks and his response is usually \"I don't know.\" He isn't usually like this when I need to talk to someone about difficulties in my life . I guess I don't blame him for not wanting to talk about the pain I feel from my previous relationship, but I just wish I could talk to him about this part of my life rather than it feel like I have this other part of my life separate from him.\n\nI don't feel like I'll ever get over these feelings. I think I'll continue to feel like the more time goes on, the longer its been that he's been gone. I just don't know how to deal with all the emotions and thoughts sometimes.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I can forgive myself and I can forgive her, I even say that I can forgive my father. I can let this resentment that's been weighing me down like chains slip away and turn to dust. The same resentment that I had hated myself for even carrying. But, death is never a clean cut, it leaves frayed, ragged edges on all ends. Loss is as complex as the lives that produce it and as complex as the lives that must deal with its existence. But those realizations are behind me for the most part. The reasons I had to resent her: missing graduation, not seeing her grandchild grow up, Not watching my final football season, not seeing senior awards or my last prom, not watching my brothers grow to who they are now, not being here for the life that I wanted to give her like she did for me, they were all valid. The reasons I had to resent him: Missing me and my brothers grow, coming back and tearing us apart, leaving this world and tearing us apart at the fresh scars, being the face that I had always been petrified of becoming, they were all valid. I was not, in fact, a terrible son or person for feeling those things. But, a double edged sword cuts both ways. Just as I am not guilty for well intention-ed, if not terribly pessimistic feelings. She is not guilty for well intention-ed if not overly reckless actions. Just as he is not guilty for indoctrinated, misguided love. I see now that, as it pertains to parental love, intention matters more than effect. And, if anyone were to judge my mother's life on intentions, they'd find it difficult to uncover something impure or devious. If anyone judged my father's life on intentions, you'd find a lot of positive, even if underlying ones. Being a son or daughter is not an easy task, and once your guardians have gone the difficulty increases still. But we try: to make them proud, to prove them right, to prove them wrong, to feel worthy of their love, to convince them that they should have loved us, to show ourselves that they did not live in vein. On the other side of the same coin, parenting is never a straight road. And parents aren't perfect people. But they try, and that's the noblest intention you can have, to give up ambition after ambition and hope after dream after wishful ever after to your own, so they may accomplish those things. That action, of pure, unconditional love, casts a larger shadow than any pessimistic thought, reckless action, or mis-expressed affection. I've decided to forgive them and to forgive myself and to live through her. I will take example from my father, and I will let that stop me from wandering. However, Everything I do, Everything I'm about, the fabric of my very being, were all forged by her example. The man I am today, and the man that I will be when all is said and done, exists to further her spirit, Exists to continue her irrepressible work ethic And Exists, above all else, to make sure the seeds of love that she sowed in this world will blossom and not wilt away. As for what that entails, I'm not entirely certain. I'll know it when I see it. In the meantime, the spectating is over, My life is my own.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

It's been nine years.", "author": "femininedragon", "self_text": "My father died in 2010 from brain cancer, which was diagnosed nine months beforehand after a seizure. We were very close, and I was 12 when he died.\n\nWe lost him by degrees - first he lost his energy, then he stopped being able to get out of bed, then he stopped being able to hold conversations, and then speaking altogether. In the last months I don't know whether he recognised anyone; we would visit him in the nursing home where he was dying, but it didn't feel like it was him. I remember not wanting to go, and mum having to drag me and my brother to visit him. I remember the vomit stains the family photos that we had blu-tacked to the walls by his bed, and the tubes running out of his body. We missed his actual death by a few minutes, but the mental image of his open-mouthed corpse in this stinking nursing home is burned into my memory.\n\nI didn't cry at the time, or at the funeral, or really any time afterwards. At the time I thought it was because he died by degrees, so when he actually died it felt like a relief that the ordeal was over; the dad I knew and loved had gone several months beforehand anyway. I felt very little for the loss of the husk he had become. I have two younger brothers, the younger of whom is severely intellectually disabled, and I think I went into survival mode as things with my mum got very tough soon afterwards (she was the newly widowed mother of three children, one of whom required 24/7 care, so I can understand why she became so constantly stressed. She took a lot of it out on me, I think because I was the oldest child and I think I reminded her a lot of him.). We lost a lot of our support network - we have no immediate family where we live (first generation immigrants) and a lot of our family friends fell out of contact after dad died - either because they were only friends with us because they were friends with him, or because they didn't know how to handle the whole grieving widow thing.\n\nBefore he died my parents had had a bad relationship - if he hadn't died they probably would have gotten divorced within the next few years anyway. My dad was much closer to me than to my brothers, and my mum was (and remains) much closer with my healthy younger brother than she has ever been with me. Their favouritism meant that there was an almost tribal split down the middle of the family.  So when my dad died I became quite isolated; my teammate was gone.\n\nBefore dad died me and my (healthy) brother were constantly at each other's throats, fighting a lot more frequently and viciously than siblings usually do (in retrospect I think it was a reaction to our parents' antagonism), but after dad died things completely switched and we became very close, and I took on a semi-parental role to him. I love him more than anyone else in the world but it's been hard not to resent him for the obvious favouritism my mum shows towards him.\n\nIn the months after he was diagnosed and was going through treatment, I began having a very intense feeling of being watched in my everyday life, when I was alone, by my whole middle school class and teacher - I would act, when I was in my room alone, as if for an audience; self-conscious in my movements and behaviour. It wasn't a paranoid belief that I was actually being watched, but more an emotional sense of living my life for the purpose of an observing third party, a peer group. The pure subjective experience of living disappeared. Over time that feeling waned but it has never fully gone away. I feel self-conscious doing embarrassing things even when no one is watching.\n\nIn the years after his death I was socially withdrawn and very sad, often crying for hours after getting back from school. At the time I figured I was just a sad person, or that his was what adolescence was like for everyone, or that it was a reaction to a loneliness I felt at school, but I wonder if it was connected to my feeling of being lost without my dad. I also comfort ate a lot and was very overweight until I was about 17.\n\nI'm 21 now, in college, and I just woke up sobbing from a dream where he was alive and we had a normal relationship, but he was closer to my (healthy) brother than me in the way that my mum is in real life. Within a few minutes of being woken up by this dream and sobbing really hard I started self-soothing by distracting myself - I have been chatting to a few friends who are awake in different time zones, and I feel the familiar lull of the grief being pushed under the immediate topic of conversation.\n\nThe only other time I have really been hit by the fact that he is gone is the day that he would have turned 60, where I was reminded of the fact unexpectedly and sobbed for hours. That was about two years ago.\n\nI feel like this is unhealthy - whenever I am immediately confronted by his death I reach for a distraction, and I feel like it's stopping me from moving on. I don't think about him or his death day to day. I think it's affected my relationship with my family, and my sense of self and personal success are built around qualities he pushed in me (rigorous academic success; logical thinking over emotional responses), to an extent that gives me tunnel vision and has contributed to a severe academic burnout in recent months.\n\nI don't know how to go about the process of actually facing and grieving his death - it's been so many years now that it feels ridiculous to go for bereavement counselling. I feel like I can't talk to my family about it because my brother was so young that he never really knew dad, and my mum hated him so bringing this to her feels impossible. I feel like I'm going to cry myself out, go back to sleep, and wake up feeling normal, and in a few months or years this will happen again. I don't know what to do.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Anyone else?", "author": "Laura51988", "self_text": "So long story short my boyfriend and I got a golden retriever (Oliver ) in 2015 . Neither of us want children , so this dog was basically our child . We spoiled him , took him everywhere , had subscription boxes of toys delivered to him every month etc .. he was everything to us . I have a severe anxiety disorder , and he was like my therapy, his company made me feel a lot safer and calmer . \n\nAnyways within a year he started getting really sick. Hundreds of dollars worth of vet visits and laser therapy and medication  and still we had no answers as to what was wrong with him, and he soon passed away . He was only a year and 3 months old . \n\nI know everyone handles grief differently.. my boyfriend and I were both messes. It\u2019s probably the only time I\u2019ve seen my bf cry in 8 years , and it made me feel that much worse but he\u2019s stronger in the sense that he accepted it quicker and knew how to move on. I on the other hand fell into a deep depression. I think because of how unexpected it was , how young he was and how helpless I felt. I felt a lot of guilt for not being able to help him, and having to put him down. \n\nFast forward a couple of months and we come across the opportunity to adopt another golden . It was like the moon and the stars perfectly aligned for us to get this dog. There were so many creepy signs that this pup was meant for us, like Oliver himself passed him along to us. His names Archie , and we\u2019ve had him for a year and a half now . At first he kind of made me more sad .. like I was betraying Oliver by loving a new dog.. like I replaced him, but once I got over that , here I am, obsessed with how much I love him. About a month ago I had one of those moments where you just stare at your dog and think of how much you love them cause of how stinking cute they\u2019re being and suddenly I just lost it. I started panicking thinking \u201c what have I done !! \u201c I just went through such heart ache with Oliver\u2019s passing.. and now here I am with another dog who I\u2019ve just realized I love just as much and now I feel stuck. Like there\u2019s no going back, I\u2019ve just forced myself into this same situation cause obviously one day I\u2019m gonna have to say goodbye to him too and then there I was bawling my eyes out over the future death of my perfectly healthy happy young dog as if it was happening today. \n\nNow I can\u2019t stop. It happens at least once a week. Mostly when he\u2019s sleeping and I cuddle him.. at first it\u2019s just a cute moment, we all do it.. bug our pets while they sleep lol but now I just lay with him and it brings me back to laying on the floor with Oliver when he was sick knowing I had to say goodbye soon , or when I laid with him at the vet petting him while he passed away, and then all of a sudden a cute happy moment turns into me full blown crying thinking of having to do that with Archie some day. \n\nAs I said I have anxiety and depression, it\u2019s not really new for me to worry and grieve about things that haven\u2019t happened yet or that I can\u2019t control, and most people just say \u201c you can\u2019t worry about the future you have to live in the moment and appreciate the time you have now \u201c but honestly I think that\u2019s my problem . I appreciate the moments too much cause I\u2019ve had a lot of loss in my life so I\u2019m ALWAYS aware of how important moments are and how easily they can be taken away so that doesn\u2019t help. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering if I\u2019m the only whacko who sometimes stresses out about the future loss of their animals , or if anyone\u2019s been there so I feel less alone in my misery lol \n\nLoving people / animals is amazing but also absolutely terrifying .", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I slept at her house from friday to saturday and yesterday to today. Yeah i liked him, but somehow i don't cry over him. He was pretty cool and just a nice buddy.

Even for a puppy he was just always so calm and gentle and just sweet, he loved to be near us and was a little shy with strangers and was also so gentle and cautious about how he played, even when he got to be a little tank of a thing at 80 pounds of muscle. He and our older girl would cram into the same dog bed even though they each had their own because they loved to snuggle and hated being separated. When my fianc\u00e9 had a medical emergency earlier this year we started getting our boy trained to be a service dog because he was so clever and obedient and he and my SO were so well bonded. \n\nWe have a neighbor we share a fence with and they put this netting all over it last week as part of some thing they were planting. We couldn\u2019t even see it until we went right up to it, but our boy chewed on it and it ended up getting stuck inside his intestines. We had it removed through surgery which is how we realized what it was and went looking for where it came from. It was a rough surgery but the vet was pretty confident that while he wasn\u2019t totally in the clear he had a really good shot. \n\nBy the end of last week he was acting like his old self, he was cuddly and alert and started eating and we really thought thank fucking god, he\u2019s going to be okay. Then in a matter of hours last night he started showing signs of distress and my SO took him to an emergency animal hospital. They realized something inside him had ruptured and we opted to try another surgery and he didn\u2019t make it. \n\nPart of me feels stupid for just how devastated I am but I feel so incredibly heart sick. He was still pretty much a baby. We had so many plans for this summer and for the next 10+ years we should have had him. We did everything we needed to for his recovery and spared no expense or effort in taking care of him. It was just such a stupid weird accident. And it\u2019s been a bad year in general, we\u2019ve had our own health issues, finances have been tight, we\u2019ve had other little tragedies. Honestly such a helpful thing through all that stress and heartache was our pups, being able to be in our home and have the four of us here and together and say \u201cat least we have this.\u201d  And baby boy would curl up with us and let us hold him and it just felt better having him around. \n\nAnd normally I can really buckle down through hardship and come out stronger in the other side but what the fuck. A sweet little boy just died sick and in pain for no reason. Nothing good is going to come from this. It\u2019s not going to lead us to bigger and better things. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do with his things. His bed, his harness, his dishes, his toys, his little life jacket. My fianc\u00e9 is so crushed. I bought our boy for him as a birthday present last year. He\u2019d routinely tell me it was the best gift he ever got, we\u2019d be in our bed with our guy and our lady and comment on how our little family felt like it was finally whole. \n\nI know that with time we\u2019ll eventually be able to feel okay but right now it hurts so much. I can\u2019t stop thinking about him and how sudden this all was. At this time last night his head was in my lap and he was nudging at my hand to keep petting him. Now he\u2019s just gone. He\u2019s gone and I\u2019ll never see him again. The man I love most in the world is devastated and I can\u2019t do anything to ease his pain. Ever our other dog can tell something is wrong and hasn\u2019t left his side since we got home, and keeps sniffing at our boy\u2019s things. \n\nI can\u2019t stop thinking that if we had just gone in to the hospital a little bit sooner, if only I had done XYZ, thinking of all the ways this could have been prevented. I feel so guilty and hurt and I just miss him so much and I can\u2019t stop thinking about what a stressful and scary week this was for him and for that to be the last thing he felt.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I knew he was mentally ill and struggling in school, but it had been going on so long it was a kind of constant. I know that sounds terrible, but I don\u2019t know how else to describe it. \n\nA month ago we got dinner and he was telling me how stressed he was in school and how he didn\u2019t think he would graduate and I didn\u2019t take his pain very seriously because he had told me these types of things before. I should have done something more to help him, but it was so difficult because we went to college nearly 3 hours away from each other. \n\nMy heart hurts so bad. When I go on Facebook I can see he was logged on two days ago. I should have reached out to him and told him how much I care about him. I keep replaying in my mind how he ended his life, and it pains me so much to know that he was in such a dark place and that he felt so alone. I would have done anything for him and I wish he would have reached out to me. \n\nI know it\u2019s typical of people to romanticize the deceased, but he was truly the best person I knew. He was so selfless and giving and polite and kind and gentle. I wish I could have taken his pain away. \n\nI miss him so much. My grief goes in waves: sometimes I\u2019m fine, but as soon as I mention his name I start sobbing. There\u2019s a hole in my heart that I feel so deeply. I want my best friend back.

I'm 19 now. For years after they died I was always mindful of their birthdays and death anniversaries, and those dates have been historically horrible days for me. But I would always do something special like light up a sky lantern or something to remember and honor them. But for the last year or two I've been less invested in celebrating the dates, and I haven't lit any sky lanterns for them in about a year. It's recently gotten to the point where I just completely forget those dates and I'll just suddenly remember like, \"Oh, the day dad died is next week,\" but I won't do anything for it, and I'll seldom be aware of it on the actual day. My life has been more busy than it used to be and I'm also currently dealing with my own personal problems, yet I feel like I'm doing them a disservice by not honoring them on these days. I want to \"move on\" with my life but I feel a bit guilty.\n\nIs this a normal part of grieving, or has anyone else experienced this before? I do miss my parents all the time, would it benefit or hurt me to start celebrating these days again?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I am having a hard time and it's been years. I think I don't know how to process it all. I wake up at weird hours and can't sleep. I grind my teeth from anxiety in my sleep and have sad nightmares. I was very close to my family and surrounded by family my whole life, now most of my family has died over the past ten years and the rest of it is fractured and I feel like my whole reality changed and my perspective on living has changed. I can't buy into what some other people around me at work etc have bought into about life principles because they haven't experienced loss and I feel like they are making those life decisions in the blissful bubble I used to live in. Like sacrificing so much for a job when it doesn't matter because in ten years I could be completely mentally disabled because of a terminal genetic condition if I happened to inherit it, so why do I care about retirement. Why do I care about being responsible or having such a workaholic work ethic. But I do care and it is ingrained in me, but I am trying to change the way I live and work to reduce the stress and anxiety I feel, I have a super high pressure career, because my time could be short or not and my whole outlook on life after seeing my loved ones go through such suffering has changed me forever from who I once was.

All I think about is her. She\u2019s the only close friend I had, and I\u2019ve never been even close to as close with anyone as I was with her. But sometimes I have to be a human. For example, I teach, and when I teach I have to be \u201con\u201d and engaging in order for my students to give half a shit about the class. Most days this is fine, but some days it just feels like I\u2019m putting on a show for everyone. This was especially the case when I was being observed. For some reason I was thinking about her a lot the week before my observation, and although I had done my homework for my class that day I was so worried that I\u2019d fuck it up. And at the same time, I just didn\u2019t want to teach - I wanted to stay in bed all day and listen to a playlist my bff and I used to listen to and cry until I fell asleep. Going to teach that day and having to pretend everything was cool felt like lying to her. So I started to think about what she\u2019d do or say if she was still around and I could text her right before class. For some reason, I thought of how she used to playfully call me \u201cyo/u lil shit\u201d when we\u2019d have some light banter. It made me smile. Idk why, but I thought that if I wrote that on my wrist, then when I was teaching I would know I wasn\u2019t hiding my pain about her and it would help me to remember how she used to help and positively move me. [So I did just that.](https://imgur.com/gallery/3fP71ke) Now I write this on my wrist whenever I\u2019m nervous, low, unmotivated - or heck, even when I just want to \u201cbring her with me\u201d while I do something as mundane as the dishes. It\u2019s not much, but I\u2019ve been working on doing these things to help myself stay alive and to keep moving in a world without her. \n\nI\u2019m thinking that I\u2019m gonna get this tattooed now.\n\nEdited: spelling error", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

{"post_id": "bj6h9a", "created_utc": 1556647476, "title": "This is Hudson", "author": "KaraokeMary", "self_text": "Hudson belonged to this guy I started dating. I would come over to his place to see him and Hudson would jump up and try to lick my face. He was big, black, and all muscle, but the biggest marshmallow of a dog I had ever met. He needed walking every day, so me and this guy would take him all around the park. We would talk for hours on those walks in between trying to keep Hudson from eating goose poop. Eventually this guy and I fell in love on those walks with Hudson, and we decided to move in together. Because I was a student and was home more often, Hudson and I would hang out a lot. We'd snuggle, go on our own private walks, and talk. Man, I talked to that dog constantly, and he listened! Eventually he became my own personal shadow, I could never be in the house without him right behind me. He would harass me while I did yoga, try to sit with me on the stairs even though he was 95 lbs, and guilt trip us both when he knew we were leaving the house without him. If he ran out of water in the middle of the night he would clank his bowl against the wall as loud as he could until one of us got up to refill it. He destroyed countless sheet sets and even a mattress once because he hated it when we left him at the house alone. He survived and fully recovered from cancer, a torn ACL, and nerve sheath swelling near his brain stem that just about paralyzed half his body. We sat with him on the floor as he suffered from countless life-threatening illnesses, only to bounce back to walks and toys and rolling around in the snow. He loved us, and he was well loved. That guy and I got engaged last year. We set our date for August 31st of 2019, and Hudson was so excited to have so many people over for the engagement party. He loved people, pets, and attention. We tried to think of a way to incorporate him in the wedding, because you put your family in your wedding, and we decided he would make a great ring bearer. I looked for special collars for him to bring our rings down the aisle.\n\nAbout a week ago Hudson went off his food, and developed a cough. We took him to the vet and his bloodwork showed severe anemia, his x-rays showed a weird shape to his spleen and some haze that indicated internal bleeding. We scheduled him for splenectomy, which he was supposed to go in for this morning. But we lost him on Sunday night. His big, strong body and life-loving soul just couldn't make it to today. We brought him to the ER, and we were both there with him, stroking his head and side, thanking him for his friendship and trying to convey just how much we loved him as he passed. We miss him terribly, the house is cold and empty and quiet now. Where as before I could not stop thinking about the wedding, now I struggle to imagine it without him. Our hearts are broken. But we wouldn't trade it for anything. Hudson was special, and he was special to us, and man did we live our best lives together with him at our sides. I have moments where I wonder how I will get through the next day, the next hour, the next minute without him. But he was here, and he was so loved, and we will keep him in our hearts for the rest of our lives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is Hudson.

Yes really, just hear me out. My point is, only those who have been out in space really know what it\u2019s like. How the G-force feels, the eeriness of going beyond earth and venturing into a starry black world.\n\nGrief is similar in that if you\u2019ve not been in that situation yourself, it\u2019s difficult to even imagine what it would be like. And even when you do try and picture it, the reality is way beyond what you pictured.\n\nI think one of the most frustrating things about dealing with grief is the reactions you get from those around you, at least that\u2019s what I\u2019ve found anyway. You see, grief should be spoken about, explored and supported, but this doesn\u2019t always happen. Grief makes people act strange. Have you noticed that some people would rather avoid you than talk with you about your grief?\n\nI know it\u2019s very annoying, and it makes you feel like these people don\u2019t care. They probably do care, they just don\u2019t know how to show it. And because they can\u2019t possibly contemplate what your grief feels like, they panic.\n\nIf you find some people drift away, give them time, and a few years down the line they may reappear in your life. There\u2019s no need to hold a grudge because they weren\u2019t there for you. At least hear them out and see how things were from their perspective.\n\nI thought it might be useful to write down how it feels from a grieving person when those around you distance themselves, and what we\u2019d really like people to do.\n\nIf I was to write an open letter to those who don\u2019t understand grief, this is what I would say.\n\nTo whom it may concern\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve lost someone who was dear to me, and now it feels like I can\u2019t live without them, and I\u2019ve fallen apart. I don\u2019t quite know how I\u2019m going to put myself back together. I know you can\u2019t understand what grief feels like, but if I were to try and describe it, it feels as though someone is reaching inside your heart and squeezing it tight.\n\nExcept the squeezing never stops. Every time that person pops into my head, or I am reminded of what I\u2019ve lost, the squeezing starts again, and if it gets too tight, my heart is going to disappear altogether. There are times when I\u2019m getting on with my day like everybody else, and then out of nowhere my grief attacks me, and I\u2019m paralysed.\n\nWhen I voice my grief some people find it awkward. They don\u2019t know what to say and are afraid of saying the wrong thing. Well, the truth is, sometimes I just want someone there as a sounding board, someone who can listen. And there\u2019s really nothing you can say that\u2019s wrong.\n\nOK maybe there\u2019s one thing, \u2018it will get easier\u2019. Please don\u2019t say this. At the moment it feels like it will never get easier, and saying that it will suggests there will be a time when the person I\u2019ve lost will become less important, and that thought terrifies me.\n\nI know you might want to go and hide under a rock when I get upset or start talking about my loss, but I\u2019d really love it if you try and be around some of the time. I don\u2019t need you to show me endless sympathy or be there every single day, I\u2019d just really like to just go for coffee or do things together that might help distract me.\n\nI get that this is hard for you too, and that death and loss is a tough topic for anyone. It probably scares the crap out of you because you are terrified in case you lose someone. You might be drawing a blank when it comes to thinking of something to say to me, but I can help you out. I can steer the conversation and help you to avoid those quiet silences.\n\nOne important thing you need to know is that I\u2019m not just going to snap out of it in a year or so. People with grief don\u2019t just \u2018move on\u2019 when a certain amount of time passes. Instead of ceasing to exist, grief tends to evolve and change, and adapt to each person as their grief takes on new forms. A bit like a shape shifter that can morph into new animals.\n\nToday my grief might feel like a tiger clawing at my skin, and next month it could feel like a dolphin diving through the waves, it just depends. I\u2019d really like you to come on this journey with me. I can teach you a lot about grief and overcoming life\u2019s challenges and our relationship will grow in new and beautiful ways.
