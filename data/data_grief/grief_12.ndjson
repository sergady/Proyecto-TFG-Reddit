We all knew last year would probably be the last holidays spent with her and we went all out. Spent almost every weekend doing things as a family to see her as often as we could. I hosted Christmas at my home and it was the most joy filled Christmas we\u2019ve had in awhile. Fast forward a month and she had a fall and then after the fall her health just took a turn for the worst. I took a week off of work to be there for her passing and my family. It\u2019s been a hard one to cope with just because how unexpected it was for all of us. The day before she passed my significant other told me he had gotten orders to Nebraska and we leave in June. My first ever move away from home where I\u2019m more than 20-30 minutes away from family, and also the first of all the kids to flock the nest. \n\nIn May my great grandfather passed away, a day before my wedding reception. The month before that I was dealing with my aunt getting addicted to drugs again, and my grandfather beating my grandma. If you can\u2019t tell it had already been a doozy of a year before my great grandfather passed. His death was little expected but still torn me apart when i heard the news. My family opted to tell me after my wedding reception because of everything that had unfolded before it. I\u2019m grateful for that. But I never got to see him one more time his passing, I\u2019ve beaten myself up over it but i was planning my wedding, getting ready for a cross country move, and still working full time. \n\nIn June one of my very close co-workers passed very unexpectedly. It was my last week of working with my company, the day before we joked i wouldn\u2019t come finish my last couple days because of how crazy it was during that season. He was there for me through those past 2 deaths, he was one of my best friends at work. We\u2019d literally see each other 6 days a week for a year straight. We all thought the morning he didn\u2019t show for work he was just running late and I\u2019d get a call from him asking what route i was doing, that wasn\u2019t the case. A friend of mine shared an article on Facebook, i read it and was in complete denial. I called my supervisor and asked if it was our guy and she sadly confirmed it was. All three of us were close. 3 peas in a pod. He made that job bearable every single day. After his passing I didn\u2019t even want to show up for the rest of my time there, it didn\u2019t feel right. But I did. It was just something I wasn\u2019t prepared for, life is so short. It took me for a spin. \n\nIn August my nana suffered a stroke, by then I was already moved half across the country trying to settle into this new life I was making. I took the news pretty heavy, she wasn\u2019t able to speak on the phone because her speech was affected by the stroke, i was worried if i didn\u2019t get home soon enough I wouldn\u2019t get the chance to see her one last time, i scrounged up all the money that I could and got on a plane home in October. I saw all my family, including my nana thinking it would be the last time I could see her. My family is never straight forward about how someone\u2019s health is, and i just didn\u2019t wanna miss an opportunity if this was the last leg. She just lost her husband in May, so I definitely thought it was her time. But it wasn\u2019t, thankfully. She\u2019s still kicking and i love that badass woman. \n\nLast month my great grandmother passed away. She was 92. We all knew it was only a matter of time before it was her calling. Her health had been declining the past year. But I never expected having to deal with a passing of a loved one 1300 miles away from home. It was my first time not being able to take a week off and spend it with family. This feeling was all too new, of course dealing with 3 passings before this you would think I might be able to handle it a tad bit better but I couldn\u2019t, i still can\u2019t. I\u2019ve deflected any and all \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m here for you\u201d. Anything along those lines. It\u2019s hard to accept because every one of those are all from my people that are 1300 miles away. I\u2019ve spiraled into a pretty gloomy depression. I have my days where I\u2019m high energy and jolly but by the end of the night I\u2019m exhausted and feel like I\u2019ve used all my energy to try and be happy around the people I\u2019ve met since my move. \n\nThis year has been a whirlwind of loss and pain. I\u2019ve gained some through it all as well don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m grateful for the good things that has been brought upon me this year but I\u2019ve been trying to heal from 3 previous losses of life the 4th one threw me over my edge.

On monday they called the nurses because they thought he was on his way out. I was in South Korea and had been for a month and my flight home wasn't until Thursday. I called him and we got to tell each other we love each other. I finally got to him around midnight on Thursday, he was too heavily medicated to speak to me or even open his eyes but I held his hand and said goodnight. He passed away that night in his sleep. His partner woke me up to tell me he'd gone at about 4am so I went in to say goodbye. He waited for me and that breaks my heart so much. But I feel selfish because I wish I hadn't made it, my last image of him was awful, such a genuinely awful sight, he was so sick. If I hadn't made it my last image of him would have been when he was a lot brighter and the last time we spoke was to say I love you. I know it's horrifically selfish of me but I wish that that image of him still in his bed wasn't the image that I see every time I think about him.

I told him to cease efforts and just embraced my poor mom. Alot of what happened next is a blur. But I do know and am thankful for my firefighter brothers.

I still can\u2019t believe he\u2019s gone. The state he was in was awful. End stage renal failure, staph infection, sepsis, heart failure etc. I hate that my last image of him was of him being so swollen, skin tinted yellow, and toxins literally leaking from his body. The only thing that sort of helped was he had what the nurses called one last \u2018rally\u2019 where he became very lucid and I was able to say goodbye and tell him I loved him. Unfortunately I was warned not to get false hope from this sudden state of lucidity but foolishly I thought to myself that maybe his life could somehow be saved. He liked to eat ice (always did) and seeing him scoop ice out of the cup by himself and carry on a seemingly coherent conversation seemed like things were improving. Sadly, that only lasted a matter of hours. By late afternoon the next day it was impossible to wake him up and by 3am he was gone. The shock still hasn\u2019t worn off. This isn\u2019t my first major loss, but it\u2019s one that hit especially hard. \n\nOn the other hand, I found out in late April just a couple weeks after my birthday that my mom has stage 4 metastatic breast cancer. It spread from her breasts, to her lungs, down her abdominal wall, and into her colon. She can no longer walk around the house without struggling to breathe or coughing to the point where she sometimes throws up. I\u2019m extremely close to my mother as I also consider her my best friend and watching her suffer knowing I only have a short time with her breaks my heart so much. \n\nI\u2019m so overwhelmed with everything especially because the death of my father was unexpected. Despite his health issues, his rapid decline wasn\u2019t something I was anticipating. Although I\u2019m not a kid, I am young enough to where losing both parents feels like I\u2019m being stripped of many many years and memories I could have had left with them. I cherish every day I have my mom here and I know I\u2019m not the only one in this boat and don\u2019t mean to sound selfish or like I\u2019m having a pity party, but I feel desperate for stability and I\u2019m exhausted from anxiety and depression.

I'm 19 and lost my big brother a bit over a year ago. I often think I'm 'over it', as stupid as that sounds, because I go periods in which I fool myself into believing he's just away somewhere. However, sometimes it just hits me and sends me spiralling. I recently got some fantastic news, and after the initial excitement over the last few days I'm just thinking tonight about how I wish I could tell him. He'd be really proud of me, I think.\n\nI didn't get to meet my brother until I was about 16 due to personal circumstances, and I resented him for a long time. We actually became close near the end, and I often feel like it's incredibly unfair that just after I got to really know him, he got taken again so suddenly. It makes me feel guilty-- I beat myself up about it because I think I should've appreciated him when he was there sooner, but I can't really change the past. \n\nApologies to ramble here, but I feel bad to talk about his death to my parents and siblings because it just upsets us all, and it feels awkward to talk about him with a lot of my friends sometimes. I appreciate that this subreddit exists-- thank you.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Hands down the funniest guy I ever knew and the best story teller. \n\nHe would never rest. He was stubborn. He was always going and worked hard every day of his life. He just would never slow down or admit when something was wrong. Ultimately, that was his downfall.

I lost so much of myself when she died, and don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll ever get used to her not being around. \n\nIf things couldn\u2019t be any worse, my great grandmother just died 6 months before her. It caused so much turmoil with everyone in my family over money and who got what from the Will. It\u2019s been such a difficult year because I lost two very important people near and dear to me. I\u2019m struggling to move on from it, and I just learned I have bipolar disorder, which comes with many depressive episodes. My job isn\u2019t what it\u2019s cracked up to be and I feel like I\u2019m not living up to my full potential. I just got ghosted by a guy I was dating for four months when I was sad over the holidays coming up. I feel so alone...\n\nI know one day things will clear and get better. It may not happen right away, and it might still be a difficult journey, but I\u2019m hoping the new year will be a way better one. Anyway, I had to get this off my chest because it\u2019s been bothering me so much lately, especially since this was our first thanksgiving without her. I just want life to be normal again, and not this empty void of a person I used to have around in my life. If I could bring her back and tell her how much she means to me and how much I miss her, just one more time. I never imagined that I\u2019d start losing the ones closest to me at this age.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

We've had this cat since she was a year old and she was the first real pet I ever had, so hearing this just completely wrecked me.

I have no idea what I would call the relationship. I don't want to say it was complicated because that to me sounds like we had serious issues. The only issues we had were normal parent-children stuff. The thing that made us distant wasn't the things we had between us, but rather our attitude. I'm a very emotionally closed off person. I got that from him. I have trouble expressing myself sincerely. I'm one of those assholes who've learned to use self-deprecating jokes around peers to avoid improving myself. My dad was a different story. His closed-offness manifested itself by being really awkward. He could be pretty absent-minded and inappropriate sometimes. Still, I've always felt a bond with him. And I did always want to make him proud. But don't feel like I've ever got to express it well.\n\nLately, dad would steal me away and talk to me in private. Whenever we did it would always end up being about the same old shit. How I needed to start think about my future. My grades, getting a job. All that typical dad advice. I got so tired of hearing the same old pressure-inducing spiel that I kept making excuses to reject his invitations for more talks. It wasn't easy rejecting dad. Whenever he got frustrated that he wasn't being understood he'd get shout-y. And he really felt that I needed to get what he was telling me through my head. The sad part is, I know he really did want to have more deeper talks. And we kinda did once. It's just really hard to start conversations like that when none of us are good at them. \n\nAnyway, he passed away. It was 4 weeks ago, by a brain hemorrhage from a stroke. This was both expected and unexpected. Expected because he's been diagnosed with arrhythmia since September and he's one of those men who became really stubborn when it came to listening to doctors. They told him if he just took his medications it could be reversed, but he kept refusing. It was unexpected, because just a few weeks before, he had a heart attack, and while he was still in denial, that shook him enough to start cooperating and start taking his pills more regularly. But it was too late. He woke up in the morning with a stroke, and before he could recover in the hospital, had a second one the day after. \n\nThis expected and unexpected combination fills me with guilt. Becoming more aware of the possibility of him dying soon made me realize I needed to open up to him soon. Meaning I had most of a year to face my fear and do that already. But since I didn't and he died without warning,without being able to say goodbye, I now feel like shit. What gets me is that I felt like only recently did I start to really know who he was. I figured now that I understand him better, I could begin to have real conversation with him. Find ways to get through to him. Have it so that we could be more than just father and son. We could be friends. \n\nBut now the chance is over.\n\nMy only solace is knowing that what we had wasn't nothing. I know that he loved me and that he worried about me. That is probably enough. But try as I can, I can't shake the feeling that I could have made things better. That my cowardice cost me a more closing ending.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I laid down on the ground where she passed once the paramedics and police allowed me into her room. Her body was still warm. I laid next to her for what seemed like a second but later I found out was 15 minutes. I cried. I plead for her to wake up. The pain in my heart could not go away. In our religion we have 24 hours to bury someone who passes. I went to prayer still in shock and followed the car after that to my moms final resting place. I placed her in her grave.

They were aged in their early twenties. I had a fairly modern friendship as they lived in an overseas developing country. When we first met they showed me around the city over a few days. We caught up again in their city a year later and kept in touch for about 3 years with messages every 4-5 months. It was assumed we would see each other again in their country or mine (it was kinda a life goal of theirs to travel to my country). This wasn't a romantic relationship.\n\nObjectively I know I am not a \"close\" friend, but their positive personality traits made a lasting impression on me and so I am driven to honor their memory in some way. I am thinking of contacting the father and sharing some quotes from them I have that show they cared a lot about their family and also some insight into their aspirations for the future like what job they were thinking about and the city they wanted to live etc (obvious things but sometimes we don't talk to our parents about this stuff). I am also thinking to suggest to the father that I donate in their memory to a charity related to the cause of death, or ask him to suggest another cause they were fond of. Perhaps this is first world thinking though....I am not sure if they would find that strange compared to financial assistance to family. I do know the deceased person highly valued their family's well-being.\n\nNot sure how appropriate it is for me to contact the family given I am not that close. Also a bit apprehensive about how confusing a largely internet based friendship with a foreigner would appear to the family.\n\nAssistance in working through these thoughts would be appreciated, thanks", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He thought his oxygen wasn't working. He was very panicky. He tried using his pulse oximeter and it wouldn't give a read. It worked on my hand, but not on his. I gave him the morphine and lorazepam early. I had to crush the lorazepam up because he couldn't swallow pills anymore. I mixed the morphine with pineapple juice because he hated the taste. It didn't seem to help him, he asked me if he was gonna die. He was asking me to call an ambulance. He was on hospice. But I think he still thought he was going to get better. I called the hospice nurse but she wasn't available. I went into the other room, I panicked, I told them they need to get someone here ASAP or I'm going to call an ambulance because my dad is suffering and nothing is working. I had truly cracked that morning. My dad was saying he couldn't breathe and what was i to do. I knew if I called an ambulance he would just pass away in a hospital room instead of at home like he wanted. But it was awful not being able to do anything for him. Hospice told me to give him more morphine so I did. He started to calm down and feel like he could breathe again but the pulse oximeter still wouldn't work. I kept trying it like a fool. Maybe it's broken. But why does it work for me? His oxygen was that low that it couldn't even read his pulse. He became eerily calm. The hospice nurse finally arrived and said yes the end is near. I called his siblings and my grandpa to come over. He was able to see everyone. Around 10:15 he couldn't control his bladder. Everyone left the room while I cleaned him up. But by the time I had him cleaned up he was asleep. The kind of sleep you don't wake up from. He had the open mouth breathing. And at 11:01 he passed away. I feel guilty because I let go of his hand and turned to get up and when I wasn't looking he took his last breath. It doesn't make sense but I feel like when I let go of his hand maybe he felt like I was letting go of him. He went from being able to talk to being gone within 5 hours. After he died I took his oxygen off his nose. That was the first time I saw him without it on in 5 years. \n\n\nWhat kills me the most is how afraid my dad was of dying. And the fact that even though he was on hospice he would say things like \"I need to get out of this bed and get my strength back\", as if he was going to get better. A week before he passed away he ate mcdonalds. I was so happy to see him eat. I don't think I've ever been so happy to see someone eat. Such a small thing but when someone is eating it means their body is still craving food for fuel. When you begin to die the body kind of ceases that craving. As the week went on he would ask for food but not eat it. Just a few bites. I think it was because of me, he didn't want me to worry or something. But then it became hard to swallow even something like soup. So he kind of gave up on it. Did my dad know he was dying? It kills me. Surely he knew. I hope he wasn't afraid in the end. I tried to comfort him, we had a pastor come to talk to him. I just wish I could talk to him again. I wish I could turn back time and see him again. He died in July of 2018. Over a year later and I'm still haunted. I can still hear the sounds of his heavy breathing. He would wake up breathing heavily and I would give him a breathing treatment. He would doze off with it in his hand. Everytime before he fell asleep he would tell me he loves me. \n\nJust rambling.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

It was cancer that took him, October 4th. I was in the hospice house, at his bed-side when he died. Fun fact about that incident: it put me off of pizza for months. Not because of anything particularly related to my father, but because for two weeks I refused to leave that room save for the occasional smoke break I allowed myself in the parking lot. That meant I didn't head home to eat dinner, meaning I had to order out. And the only three places that would deliver to where I was? Pizza shops.\n\nThat's one of the two foods I can always remember when it comes to my last days with my dad.\n\nThe other is cookies-n-cream ice cream.\n\nI remember that one so well because we got it on the last car show we ever went to, together.\n\nAnd fuck I nearly spoiled that for him, too.\n\nIt was July when the car show rolled around and my dad was in a bad state. He needed an oxygen supply at all times - either through a bottle he could carry when out of the house, or a machine when at home - and he needed assistance at all times. That meant for everything from going to the bathroom to getting food. He'd even had a bunch of his lower teeth removed after swelling and a tumor took them out. It had gotten so bad that my brother and I decided one of us basically had to be a full-time in-home caretaker for as long as it might take for it to end.\n\nOf course at the time we vainly said until he recovered. Academically we knew he was beyond that.\n\nAnd I remember my dad never complained about anything I did when it came to helping him. He never said I wasn't fast enough helping him in the bathroom or cleaning up after he was done. He never said I wasn't fastidious enough when nausea interrupted his meal. I could even remember one time I was out in the kitchen and I heard him in the living room saying that he was incredibly lucky to have a pair of sons who were working so hard to look after him.\n\nAnd yet just because his stomach was giving him troubles and I was tired, I had the audacity to suggest that we not go to the car show that day. After all it would be all blazing July heat and the only bathrooms would be porto-potties.\n\nHe was nearly teary-eyed when he said he'd still really like to go.\n\nY'all... I had been shot at in Afghanistan. I'd been stabbed while working security gigs. And I'd been getting into knock-down, drag-out fights since I'd been old enough to drive myself around.\n\nAnd nothing in my life up until then had felt like such a solid gut punch.\n\nSo we went to a car show with a friend of his.\n\nAnd he kept talking about plans for the Fairlane (the car we had bought, planning to make it a father-son project between us) and I think that day he knew he wasn't going to make it.\n\nBecause he wasn't talking about what we were going to do.\n\nHe kept talking about what I should do to restore it. And things I might like to do with it.\n\nI was listening to the man basically give off his dying wishes right there on some crowded small-town street.\n\nAnd some part of me wonders if I hadn't always been so lazy and lost in myself if we could have gone to more car shows or fishing trips or just shopping trips at the sporting goods store.\n\nAnd I'm trying not to break down while typing this so I can actually get it out.\n\nExtended family kept telling us that time would heal it but its two years on and I can't quite get over it. I feel guilty if I sleep downstairs in my own bed. The recliner upstairs is still \"Dad's chair\". And no joke there are times when I round the corner in the living room and I swear I can see him there in that recliner, watching the nature channel. Or I'll have headphones in and for just a second I'll think I heard him call for me in the living room.\n\nIf time heals then it sure is dragging its feat.\n\nBut at least I got this off my chest for now.

I am junior in college and I am 21 years old almost 22 years old this month.  This August, I transferred to a 4 year university after finishing my basics at a community college (way cheaper). I got accepted in the school of my choice and was super excited. My mom and dad were so proud when I told them. I only took two classes, French and Cultural Psychology because everything else was filled up. I started out good as everyone does in the beginning. I was actually learning French which I always wanted to learn. My first language is spanish and French came a little easier to me. My cultural psychology class was amazing. The professor is beyond and one of the best I\u2019ve ever taken. In September I was already falling behind in my French class homework. The very first weekend of October, I was going to work all weekend to finish the homework I hadn\u2019t done. On Saturday, I took a break and went to my cousins game night. Around midnight, I got a text from my mom saying to come home because my dad wasn\u2019t feeling good. I left game night and rushed home. Was speeding the whole way there. When I got home, my mom and dad were in the living room watching tv. I asked what\u2019s wrong, and she said my dad is having chest pains. I immediately said let\u2019s go to the emergency room. But my dad said he was okay. I was tearing up and telling him I\u2019m scared. He said there\u2019s nothing to worry about. It\u2019ll pass. My dad passed away the next day. It was the worst day of my life. I\u2019ve never felt such pain. He was my best friend. I had the best relationship with my dad. He was kind, intelligent, giving, funny and selfless. He was so loving. He passed on my mom\u2019s birthday. My mom hasn\u2019t been the same since. They were married for 33 years. I sleep with her each night on my dad\u2019s side of the bed. We had a funeral for him. The viewing was super full of people. My dad was a very important person at his job. They loved him so much. My dad was THE guy they went to if they couldn\u2019t figure something out. His co-workers flooded the funeral home. His good friend who retired from the same company said beautiful things about him. He said my dad is irreplaceable. No one can do the job my dad did. Not even close. They would send him to other states to finish a project because they knew my dad was the only one who could. Anyway, I started falling behind in my classes. Specifically my French class. I just didn\u2019t have the motivation anymore. I didn\u2019t care. But I also did because my mom and dad payed out of pocket for my school. Which I am so grateful for and know that not everyone has the privilege to do so. I was feeling guilty. My professor understood my situation. It\u2019s not easy. My other class I was fine but French takes so much time because it literally learning a whole language. You have to practice in order to improve and I wasn\u2019t doing that. It\u2019s now finals week and I only had one final, my French final. My psychology final I took in the beginning of November. I\u2019m writing this on December 4th. I thought my final started at 10 but actually started at 8. I emailed her if I could take it another day or time. She said I could take it at 11. She sent the message at 10:48 and I was still at home. I got to school at 11:30 ish and I couldn\u2019t find the classroom. I emailed her again if she changed classrooms. She emailed back saying the final exam is over. I can\u2019t take it anymore. This really sucks. I\u2019ve only ever failed one class before, my first semester of college. But this hurts more because I pay out of pocket and university is super expensive. I feel like I let my dad down. I know he always said that If fail a class, to just take it again. He never made a big deal of it. Just keep trying.  I just want to make him proud. This has been the worst semester ever. There are so many things that have gone wrong. I miss my dad. I miss his laugh. His smile. Everything. I just needed to vent and this helped a little. Please feel free to respond to this. I would love to hear you guys out.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Nevertheless, I've been struggling for long enough now, and I feel I've just got to get something out of my system.\n\nThe story you are about to read is true to the dot, and I will only be leaving irrelevant details out or changing them, to protect the personal integrity of others involved.\n\nOne year ago, when summer was just at it's peak, I was having the high of my life. My  fianc\u00e9e and me were regularly checking out houses on the market, going to see them and making offers left and right. My carreer was thriving - everything seemed to be going A-OK. Then came the phone call. It was from my mother. She called, and told me that on her way home, she saw a larger tree fall down some 50 meters in front of her car, which had scared her, but nothing had happened. Somewhat religious, she claimed that it was the \"mascot\" (a tiny stuffed rabbit-toy she had gotten as a present) that she kept in the car that was looking after her. I shrugged it off, happy nothing had happened.\n\nA week passes, and so - she heads out again on one of her trips. Told her to drive safe - and we'll meet again after the weekend. She calls me again, on wednesday - saying she feels like an idiot, as she had accidentally locked herself out without her car keys, home keys or phone. Of course, I asked how she is calling me then - turns out the neighbors were home, and were able to help her - and everything was ok. I was relieved, to say the least.\n\nThat same night, I had terrible nightmares. Figured it was just because of the stress and the frequent calls from her regarding things that almost went south.\n\nThen, as the week came towards it's end - I decided I'll drop by her apartment over night, since I had to wake up early in the morning, and her place was closer to where I had to be in the morning. She wasn't home - didn't really flinch too much. Made a few jokes about it to my friends (they knew about all the phone calls too) - but it wasn't unusual, considering her work did require her to travel quite a lot.\n\nIn the morning, I tried texting her, asking if she stayed longer - or went on another trip already. No answer. Once again, didn't really think of it too much, just went on with my day.\n\nDecided to drive back to her place after work, you know - just to pop by and say hi.\n\nThat's where my heart actually sunk. As I came home, I first bellowed - \"Hey, I'm home!\".. No answer. Guess she's not home yet. Check the living room, no - nothing there. Check the kitchen ---- And I realize that nobody had been there for a while, there was nothing in the fridge, nothing in the dish washer - no signs of anyone been there for a week.\n\nI try to call her, voice mail. Several times (why does the brain somehow think that'll change the fact that it'll go to voice mail over and over), but to no avail.\n\nMany will probably have already guessed by now where this is going, but yeah.\n\nI do the next reasonable thing, I call her friends, the rest of the family - nobody's heard from her since that same wednesday I spoke to her. I check her calendar, I see the name and phone number of a customer she was supposed to see on sunday (hey, that's probably where she was on sunday - cool). So of course, I call them. The woman on the end of the line sounded a bit frustrated, since apparently it was a no-show.\n\nOh boy, this is when the human mind starts to leap between a state of \"what is going on\" and \"nope\". I call 911. Operator tells me that there ain't nothing they can do. I try to convince them that where she was previously (at this point, for several  days without anyone hearing or seeing her) - there is nobody in the vicinity that would notice anything being wrong, and I begged for them to send somebody over to check if something had happened (this was a good 100 miles from home, so it was logical to me that someone who is closer, gets there faster to confirm everything is OK and I'm being stupid). Didn't help - so I told them I'll be racing down the highway as fast as my car will go, and adviced them to send a police escort (or chase, I didn't really even care at that point - my mind didn't know what to do anymore).\n\nNo police car showed up to on the way, but I did pick up two of my relatives on the way that were concerned as well. God was I relieved I did that, even though I was hestitant at first, not knowing if we were in a hurry or not.\n\nFor as we arrived, the creepiest sight I've ever seen in my entire life awaited us.\n\nThe car was parked neatly on the yard, with the trunk open - you know, like she was just about to leave. The door to the house was wide open - with the lights on inside.\n\nIt felt as if like time was standing still, and nothing was happening, like I was walking through a photo or something - nothing made any sense. There was food on the table, her bags were half-packed, it just looked like everything was just like it's supposed to be as you are about to leave home - except there is no mother to be found.\n\nWe run around the house and yard - screaming her name, trying to figure out what is going on, but no answer. Just more eery silence, with more and more things found that just look like time had stopped in that entire area.\n\nGod forbid, as I walk down towards the beach - remember the nightmare I had had last wednesday night, after the last time I spoke to her.\n\nIn the nightmare, I remember walking down the path, looking down at the pier down by the beach, seeing her laying there on her back, being pecked on by seagulls. God was that a nightmare I wish I had never seen.\n\nHowever, as I walk down that same path - I obviously then stare in horror towards the pier, panic-scanning every inch of it as it reveals from behind the tree - but no. Nothing there, just the pier. God am I relieved.\n\nUntil I see something floating in the water.\n\nNeedless to say, this is when a bunch of screaming, running and phone calls left and right start, meanwhile we drag her out of the water, only to realize she had been in the warm water for several days, and there was nothing we could even try to do.  And that's when the light rain turned into a proper summer pour-down, accompanied by thunder - not that it really mattered at that point - it was just an extra slap on the wrist to make it feel far worse then it already was.\n\nWe had to wait for almost an HOUR for the police to arrive - and despite asking for some professional help on-site (seeing as I was only 23, my sister was 25 and my aunt was only 33 - none of us had any clue what to do here) - no help arrived. Just the police, who just did their duties - and then left us there.\n\nAfter gathering our thoughts for a moment ,we decided we can't stay there - and we had to drive home.\n\nI offered to drive my mother's car - since I wasn't feeling much anything else (shock, I'm assuming).\n\nDuring that drive, my aunt had called 911 once again, so that we could get some professionals on-site when we arrive at my grandparent's house - you know, to have someone on-site when we tell the 70 year old's that their first child has just been found dead.\n\nNobody had arrived.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's now been well over a year, but the visions still haunt me - I can't forget a single detail - except everything that had happened that day before I got home. The rest of the day is like a god-damn blue-ray film.\n\nI've gone to a psych on order from my employer, I've seen crisis help workers - but it really doesn't seem like any of that has helped me move on - I still see her bloated body when I close my eyes, and if I keep them closed, the entire day starts to replay, wether I want it or not.\n\nAlcohol has occasionally been my go-to when nothing else helped - but mostly I just end up being awake until I just can't anymore - and then wake up for work with no more then 2-5 hours of sleep behind me.\n\nI feel like it's slowly tearing me apart, I don't ever really feel rested - I've stopped looking for a house - I've stopped making an effort at work.. I just don't know what to do.\n\nExcept tell my story, so maybe someone who is going through something similar can find at least some consolation that they aren't alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI never really knew what the phrase \"my condolences\" really meant, since I had never really encountered anything of this caliber before, and it was something I was taught to say when someone was going through grief. Now I know - and I wholeheartedly send my deepest well wishes to anyone going through a rough patch in life.\n\n\\[Edit\\]  \nSome more context to this all - my parents were divorced when I was born, which is why no father was mentioned in all of this.  \n\\- *MorbidCoder*", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

The doctor had given her a month, but we had her for 53 days.\n\n1PM - She was so weak (and so swollen), my dad and I couldn't sit her up in bed. So I called the hospice nurse, and had a hospital bed delivered. My mom decided she wanted to sit up for a bit, which worked out great - she sat in the living room while we set up the hospital bed in her room. She wasn't the biggest fan of the dorky furniture rearrangement, but she slid into bed anyway.\n\n4PM - She was having issues swallowing, so we decided to give her liquid morphine and her usual lorazepam. My mom was so terrified of getting addicted to morphine (???) but she finally gave in. What I didn't know is that she switched the syringes a few months prior - when the nurse said \"fill up to the first mark on the syringe\", it wasn't what we thought, and she wasn't getting enough.\n\n5PM - She was in a lot of pain. I called hospice. They put me on hold (SERIOUSLYYYYYYYYYY) and told me to crush lorazepam and give it to her. I crushed it, but the pill crusher didn't work like I thought, and she didn't get most of it. I didn't realize this for several hours, and have thought about it every night since.\n\n9PM - She was moaning in pain. I called the hospice nurse. She moved her appointment from noon the next day to 9am (LOL thanks). We needed another syringe. I went to Walmart. I tell my dad I'm going to visit with my grandpa (lives nearby), my mom hears and wakes up just long enough to say \"I don't want him over here!\" \n\n10PM - I make up a syringe for my dad to give her the morphine. Dad says however much I want to give her, he's okay with. I give her a little bit more than she was supposed to get. \n\n1AM - I wake up, make up a syringe of morphine and a syringe of crushed lorazepam in water. My dad gives it to her. She's not really conscious. My dad sleeps in the same room, he tells me to make up a morphine syringe for him to give her at 4AM, but to come in and wake him up in case he's not awake.\n\n3:54AM - My dad sends me a text, it says \"I'm awake.\"\n\n3:55AM - I wake up. I see the text, and decide to go in their room to see if my dad needs help administering it. The door to their room is mostly closed, I figure my dad is using the bathroom (bathroom is in bedroom, he took off the door because it confused my mom in her last days). I use a separate bathroom, see the door is still closed, so I hang out in my room for a few minutes getting ready to fall back asleep.\n\n4:01AM - My dad screams my name. I rush in there, he goes \"she's gone\". I grab her hand, she's cold, I say \"Mom?\" a few times, and then hug my dad.

Immediately I felt angry. \"Can't I have my fucking birthday, Halloween, Turkey day, without Christmas breathing down my throat?!\"\n\nEach day since then, I've felt something different. None of it fun. I go to work and flip into a weird mania, I think because it's safer than letting anyone see how I feel. Still. Five years later.\n\nI hate this.\n\nMy best friend had a stroke. A massive brain stem stroke. She was only  44 years old. Her youngest was seven. She also had a 17 year old, a 20 year old, and a 23 year old. We met a few years before we both wound up pregnant. I had a girl in September, she had a boy in October and we were inseparable. From her first child, she called me Auntie, as did and do her kids. Their real Aunt, hates this and me, because I am who the kids go to.\n\nHer oldest called me Christmas day at 1:16 pm. \"Auntie, mom's had a stroke, they have her in surgery, trying to remove a blood clot now.\"  My first thought was of her beautiful, thick, luxurious hair. My second thought was to ask if he needed me to be there. He said yes and I got myself and his brother, who lived in my state with his father, on a plane to Texas. Fucking Texas.\n\nOver the course of the next two weeks, my world caved, my life changed, and my soul was damaged in a way I have never experienced. \n\nI saw a lot. I participated in a few things with the nurses that left me just fucked up in my head. My best friend was paralyzed below her neck, with the exception of her right arm, and that, she could barely move. She also HATED needles, because she had horrible, collapsing and rolling veins. Taking blood was a huge issue for her. The wanted to get a PIC line in her though. I had to help and though I won't go into it, she fought it. She couldn't move, but she managed to fight it. We were both sweating, and crying, and I just kept talking in her ear, trying to take her away from where we were. She was so tiny at 5' nothing and maybe 90 pounds, and she was such a fucking warrior.\n\nThere are many things I remember and wish I didn't, and there are things I have forgotten and am getting ready to open them back up, because I feel I need to know. I e-mailed my mother, long detailed emails while in Texas, trying not to fall apart, while trying to honor my friend's wishes and find her will, trying to deal with her mother, who was very estranged from her and didn't give a shit what her daughter wanted. Mom has always told me she saved all my emails, for when I am ready. It's been so strange living with things I don't remember, but can feel. I am tired of being broken. It's gone on long enough, I know for a fact, my best friend would cry at what has become of me, and that makes me cry, because I would hate her to see me like this.\n\nI don't understand why I  still can't say certain things, including some of the darker places and moments I found myself in the first year after she died. It was made worse by the people in my life I lost because they just couldn't deal with my sad.\n\nI am so fucked up. I've done grief support for three months, through a hospital at home with a Hospice unit. A very good friend, watched me have a melt down and told me I needed help, as he asked me questions and got me to talk, and simply said, after each response, \"You need help\". He told me to call any hospital and ask hospice for help, so I did. I also called a crisis line at one point waiting for my grief support appointment to arrive. Four years  later, I knew I still needed help and started some therapy. I was diagnosed with PTSD and started treatment for that and severe grief. \n\nI make steps, I told my therapist the worst of the worst things I remember. He's nice, he's kind, he's validating and I'm still just fucked up. I would really like to remember it all. But I really wish I had a good therapist to walk me through it and treat me with mushrooms or MDMA. I can't do something like that alone, so part of me is thinking of going to Colorado.\n\nI'm tired of being with people, and playing normal, or even feeling a little normal at times, to hear something, see something, remember something and go back to Texas. It's embarrassing, and hiding it, is hard.\n\nChristmas was her favorite time of year. She loved The Street of Dreams and always took her kids to look at lights and decoration shows in the fancy neighborhoods. I freeze at the song, \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\". I sat by her bed in NICU and said through tears, \"Well Mel, it looks like you went and had yourself a merry little strokemas\". I heard those words in my head to the tune of the song. I've not been able to separate the two since then.  \n\nI'm sorry this is so long.\n\nI've called the three kids from her marriage and said I think we need to keep the Street of Dreams thing going in honor of their mom. They all agree. There is now 3 children, two girlfriends, two children to one of the g/f's and the first granddaughter. I'm witnessing the fruits of her labor and feel like a fucking thief, because SHE should be here. Though I know beyond a doubt, that she would want us to be the family we have become, the family she created by making me Auntie. We all wait for the day the youngest (with a different baby daddy) is old enough to find his brothers and sister. He never wanted to be a dad, never paid support, never treated my friend like she deserved to be treated, but he swooped in after the stroke, took his son, got a blood test and kept the kids away from their brother. He lost his mom and his siblings and left with someone he didn't really know anymore.\n\nI am terrified of the Street of Dreams, because they incorporate lights and music. I don't want the kids to me get upset, and upset them. But I want to honor their mother's memory and I want us to create NEW memories and to stop having Groundhog Day type holidays.\n\nI know holidays are hard for all of us who have lost loved ones. They are special people, and special days we were part of together, but to have the stroke ON Christmas eve/day, to have removed life support ON New Years Day, and to have had to have left two days before she passed, while she was in hospice hurt so bad. \n\nI think I am done with my emotional regurgitation. I'm sorry it's long, but I walked in my door after work, thought how much I miss her, and began crying like she died yesterday.\n\nThank you for listening.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I still hold so much anger and sadness based on the fact my parents did that... I can't get over it and I think about it everyday.\n\nThe story goes... We had a cat around the 15 year mark. Everything was going fine until we brought a new kitten home (found her in the bush outside in -30C weather, was only a few weeks old, way too young to be by herself). The old cat hated the new cat and got territorial, hissed, and was just being a bitch. Fast forward a month or 2, and eventually they tolerated each other enough to be in each others presence and things were mostly fine. Occasionally my old cat would pee in random spots around the house (could be marked to some kidney issues, but the cat was on a good diet and had some supplements from the vet) so it wasn't a huge issue according to the vet. She didn't really exhibit any other distressing signs, was still cuddly, friendly, walked around fine.\n\nMy mom hated the fact that she would pee in those spots and was getting tired of it and cleaning up the mess, which is understandable. I started helping out and doing my best to clean up, but apparently it didn't seem like it was enough.  This probably went on for \\~6 months.\n\nI left for a vacation with my dad, just a week, and when I came back, I went looking around my house to see my cat again. After calling for a bit, my mom came down and informed me that she had her put down while I was gone. I was extremely sad and distraught, but I asked what happened. She said something along the lines of \"She had cancer and it progressed to the point where I had to put her down\"; which I now realise never hearing the vet mention cancer at all. I was too distraught so I didn't bother continuing the conversation, but over the next few weeks it got me thinking about the plausibility of her story and it just seems like utter bullshit to me. My dad hasn't even said a word about this in the entire 2.5 years. I've never confronted them about the story and haven't talked to them about my feelings either.\n\nMy mom and I held a small funeral a year later by burying her favorite toy in the backyard; and that was that. Haven't really talked about it, life just kinda went on but I'm still holding back. I feel immensely betrayed that I couldn't even get to say goodbye on my terms, for my cat. That those last moments with her were taken away. I'm still so angry and tear up everytime I think about it. I'm an only child, and this cat was the one that was there for me all those years and I deserved those last moments.\n\nI know it's just a pet to some people, but to me it feels like a hell of a lot more. How do I move on from this? Do I bother confronting them about it after all this time?\n\nTLDR; Had 15 year old cat with minor health issues. Went on vacation for a week with dad, mom put down my cat while I was gone. Blamed it on \"cancer\". Still angry 2.5 years later after BS story, never confronted them.

Being a teacher is stressful enough, but definitely rewarding. However, I just have a few students that are weighing on my heart. One student of mine had the courage and strength to report his father who had been physically abusing him and sexually abusing his sisters. However, his case manager let me know that my student's father has a really good lawyer and it's possible that he'll be released and I'm told he has made threats against my student. I have another student who started the semester not doing any work. I talked to her and gave my usual rant about the importance of building habits and having some mastery over the English language. Having the skill to structure what you communicate and how you communicate it will honestly help you succeed greatly in life. After this talk, the next class she immediately separated herself from her friends in class and began turning in all her work. However, she stopped showing up to school and it's been two months. I've been told that there is a lot of issues at home and that she doesn't feel safe. I have one more student who always shows up to my class even though he ditches all his other classes. And it's fantastic that he gets his work done. However, the last few weeks he hasn't shown up to school, my class included. I don't know anything about his situation and have gotten no response when contacting his home. Then you can just sprinkle in the fact that I have a great handful of students who don't believe they are intelligent enough. The biggest issue is that I can't do anything. I can only offer resources within my own classroom setting, but I can't actually do anything to help my students in situations that no one should ever go through. I know they aren't my kids, but they are still my students and it's my responsibility to support them as best as I can, but there is literally nothing I can do for them. This is the world we live in. I mean, what the fuck. We all struggle, some succeed, some fail, some grow, some don't, and then some just get so fucking screwed up because the world we live in is sick and vile. As I type this with tears, I still have to prepare my lessons for tomorrow and continue to teach the students that are present. And I don't know what each of them are going through. I try my best to be considerate when a student acts out and offer my ear for them to talk to if they feel comfortable sharing what's going on in their lives, but most students wouldn't want to share because they need to resist and look out for themselves. And I can't do anything. How the fuck am I suppose to follow common core standards, have student meet state expectations, keep the district happy, teach lessons, and all the while expect every student to receive this when the reality is that most of them struggle more than I can ever imagine. I don't expect answers, but prayers and advice would be appreciated. I can't sleep at night. There's already enough stress having to lesson plan, teach, grade individual assignments and tests, reconfigure how I teach to align with what I see in test and assignment scores, make sure that I can get to most if not all my students and their needs in my class because all students learn differently, and still find time to relax. Even this Thanksgiving break was stressful because I recently bought a used car from a dealership and the car apparently needs tons of fixing, but the dealership's mechanics don't work weekends and I'm a teacher working weekdays which includes staying after school to help students (I also volunteered to stay after and tutor any student in the school who needs help with English assignments).

Why do you make her hold on to this painful existence? \n\nRight after that internal conversation my sister came out crying to say she just died. Was that what I was asking for? Did I do this? My sister had to see the horrible images of what happened right before she passed. Was it my fault she had to see that? It probably doesn't make sense, but I question myself over it.\n\nThen I feel guilty because I'm not sobbing like everyone else is. I even got weird looks for being so held together. I just wanted to give them comfort. I still haven't really cried over this. Is there something wrong with me? We were so close.\n\nThere's more but this is long enough.

We found out in the afternoon. I have never dealt with the loss of a parent before, but my boyfriend [22] now has no parents. He lost his father at age 17 due to heroin addiction. Now his mother, whom he was getting along well with and planning on getting an apartment together with, is dead due to a medication she was obtaining illegally (Neurontin). He is also an only child. So now it is like he has almost no one, except me, his cat, and his extended family. And of course, on a less familial level, friends and roommates. I had only been dating him for a couple of months (however we have known each other since elementary + middle school), and so was not able to get to know his mother as well as I would have liked. I know she liked and approved of me, as he even told me so - and so I was truly looking forward to becoming part of their family. I am serious about my boyfriend and I know he is serious about me. However, with this new and tragic unfolding, my boyfriend is utterly heartbroken. And it breaks me to see him so - to see him cry like a baby for his mother again, to say things like there's no point in being alive anymore, and he doesn't want to keep doing this. It breaks my heart. I want him to get through this. I called off work to stay with him all night last night. I made sure to hold him, rub him, pet him, play with his hair, wipe his tears away, kiss him, cry with him, anything I could do to let him know I am there and want to always be there for him. I am trying to be positive for him; because I did not know his mother as well as he did, it is easier for me to be positive and be a rock for him. I am typing this from my classroom. He insisted that I go to class and that just because he is grieving and his mom died that I shouldn't call off my responsibilities for him. I understand wanting to be alone and to have space. But I also am grieving for him, and for the relationship with his mother I was not able to have, and I am also quite shocked. Nobody was expecting this would happen. We had just celebrated Thanksgiving last week. The day we found out, I stayed the night before. We had a good morning together before he left for work. Neither of us knew she was already dead by the time we woke up. We didn't find out until later in the day. Thought it was going to be just another day. I also don't want him to be alone, or feel like he is all alone in the world. I also wonder if I am babying him too much. Am I doing the right thing? What else can I do to help him, and let him know I love and care, while also giving him the space he needs? Any advice appreciated.

We were partners in a project, we had just finalized our plans for our plated dessert the night before.  At the same time that we finalized our plans, she invited me to go home with her for the weekend.  I agreed at first, but not long after, my coworker, a fellow RA, had reminded me I made promises to him to bring students to his program.  I told my friend that I\u2019d have to visit another time.  The next day, she left school to head home to her fianc\u00e9 without me in the car and in the next town over she was hit by a drunk driver who crossed the yellow line.  Earlier this year I found out the guy who killed her was sent to prison for 3.5-5 years and he had a BAC of .15 when he was taken to the hospital after the crash.  He was 35.  A grown man took a 20 year old\u2019s life.\n\nI am still filled with so many emotions even a year later.  A year ago I had to complete an incredibly challenging project all on my own while filled with the grief of losing a close friend.  I was asked by my chef (we were baking and pastry students) if I could join another group, but I needed to complete our project just how we had planned.  I broke down while working on our plated dessert.  Today, since it\u2019s a Saturday, I work as the only baker in the cafe and I was hit with this immense feeling of sadness and loneliness.  I was again working all alone, rushing to complete projects that should have been a two person job.\n\nI\u2019m only 22.  I shouldn\u2019t be losing friends younger than me.

This is really the first significant death other than my uncle who died in 2010, my 2 grandmas who died in 2007 who was 87  and 2018 who was 91. i'm 22 and i am trying to get through my industrial engineering degree and graduate by 2021 hopefully. My dad was always sick and i knew that he had a more limited time on the planet than most. I thought he might make it to at least 70, but that wasin't the case. This experience has been devastating to and i have been hanging in for the most part. I find it very difficult to concentrate on homework often and when i get frustrated on difficult homework problems it makes it harder to concentrate. I do have ADHD and take medication that has worked for me for years. I have always lived with my parents up to now to help take care of my dad and we have always had a very close relationship. A much closer relationship compared to my mom(not to say i don't love my mom but our relationship is different in a good way.). My dad always used mj and we would smoke together(my mom never approved of my dad smoking) which made us closer and i do not regret in the least bit I got to really know my dad on a very personal level and i am honored to say that my dad was my best friend. We shared a lot of the same music interests and listened to the same bands. We even went to a lot of concerts together despite complications from diabetes was getting worse. There are a lot of things i would share with my dad that i wouldn't with my mom. He would be the first one to go to when i would have test anxiety or just wanted some advice or a different perspective. Now that finals are getting closer and the holidays are coming up. i'm finding it harder to concentrate on school work especially at night. At times i fall into a depression when the sun goes down because that is usually the time that i would spend with him. Its also hard when i do get anxious and frustrated on homework because i would just take a break and talk to him for a bit and go back to work. Now I don't have that support system anymore and i don't have my best friend to talk to i get even more anxious or just plain down. i tend to take longer breaks than i usually do and sometimes i just get the triggers that make me miss my dad. I just want to get reassurance that this is just part of the process and that i am doing the best i can. i see counseling bi-weekly and when i do get down or very anxious, i reach out to my friends or just visit them for a bit just to take a break from what i'm doing. Taking to people helps me even if its just talking. The relationship with my mom is still weird and i don't feel shes supportive enough because when i try to have a conversation with here about one of my interests, she really dosen't want to talk. I know she is grieving herself and it could be some of our differences as well but in the future i want to build our relationship further. We haven't had services yet, but i feel that will bring some closure when we do have them. Is it normal to feel distracted and how long may it take before my concentration goes back to normal? Any tips for concentrating during finals?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

That it always hurts but you get better. It\u2019s been 6 1/2 years since my mom died when I was 13. She had pancreatic cancer. Watching the most gleaming,joyful, charismatic, adventurous free soul be crippled with such a horrible illness really numbed me. My parents had just gotten separated months before her diagnoses and my dad was dealing with severe alcoholism all at once. I was very numbed and at the time when she passed it was not too hard for me as weird as that sounds. I was always a mommas boy and we were very close. When she passed my grandparents and relatives took it hard and seemed to get better over time. As I went into high school I was pretty normal. I had my monthly or two nights where I would break down and miss her. Fast forward I\u2019m supposed to be a sophomore in college but currently dropped out. She always got me to do my best academically and was always my rock. She told me she wanted me to go to college and get a good education. That was very important to her. I feel like I\u2019ve let her down. I have no idea what career I want to pursue. I have very poor relationships with everyone in my life and I feel extremely alone. All I can think about is my mom now that I\u2019m becoming an adult and what a crucial role she would be playing here in my life now. Its like it\u2019s been so long and I just expect her to walk in the door any moment and my happiness to be restored. It\u2019s weird because it\u2019s just now starting to happen even though she passed years ago. Sometimes I think oh I want to send that funny pic to my mom. That never started happening till recently. I truly feel like the last six years of my like have been a dream and I just woke up.  I\u2019m so lost and confused. It\u2019s like a giant pit in my soul that has recently started growing. A lot. I have a complete breakdown almost every night and I\u2019m lost in all aspects of my life. she was the only one that seemed to know what direction to point me in.

Just now joined the Grief Group. I lost my Momma November 29th, 2016. That\u2019s five days after Thanksgiving that year. My husband had dinner cooked when I got home from work. I went next door to her place to ask if she was ready to eat dinner. (We lived on one-side of the duplex and she had moved in to the other side of the duplex.)  I knocked and started to open the door. It was locked. That was unusual. I unlocked it and went in. \"Momma, you ready to eat? Momma. Hello? Momma.\", I'm saying as I walk through the house. I get to her bedroom door and it looks like she is still asleep. I say kind of loudly, \"Momma, wake up.\", walking to her bedside. She is still. She looks peacefully asleep.\n\nBut she ..... is not going to wake up to eat dinner.\n\nIt is has been three years now and it is still very raw. I love my Momma. I miss my Momma. I miss her very much. I thought there was at least another 20-25 years. She was only 63. She was supposed to be around until at least 85 years old. You know, around long enough for me/us to have to worry about whether she is going to a senior living or live with us. The usual. No.\n\nI see her birthday in the time on the clock; 6:13. I always say something to her when I see that, when I think of her, or when someone mentions her name. I have things that I should have said more often. I shouldn\u2019t have gotten annoyed with her so easily. I have regrets.\n\nHowever, I am very grateful that she got to see my husband and I clean for more than two years before she left. We had done meth for eighteen years.  Decided to try to get clean. A couple months later, the other side of our duplex opened up for rent. We thought it would be great if she could get into it. Her being there would help us to stay clean. Plus, I would get to see her more. I love that.\n\nI try to keep myself in that spot. The gratefulness of spending time with her every day. Having her right next door to go pick on her or hug her whenever I wanted. Then after a few minutes of that has passed; I am mad. I am completely angered that she was taken away so soon. I cry for a while, yelling hateful things at the sky.\n\nAnd yes, Thanksgiving now SUCKS!\n\nThank you for having me.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

We spent the entire month of December in the hospital with him, Christmas included, and in January we moved him to a rehabilitation center. At this time his doctors found that the cancer had already spread to his lungs, spine, and kidneys and at 79 years old he decided not to seek treatment. In February he came home with hospice, and to help my mom with his care, my husband and I moved in with them. He passed away 2 days after Easter, make for a very fast but excruciatingly long 4 months. \n\nNow that we're rounding in on the 1 year of my dad getting sick and quickly approaching Christmas I'm finding myself less and less excited to do anything for the holidays and this is a sentiment shared by my mom. I'd already told my husband that I didn't want to do anything for Christmas and, being the most patient person that he is, he agreed to take a break this year. \n\nBut now I'm getting outside pressure from my aunts (moms sisters) to make sure that I do something for my mom since \"she seems sad and like she doesn't want to do anything\". Her and I have already had conversations about not doing anything this year, but now I'm doubting if that actually what she wants or if I should still get her gifts, or just go forward with our agreed plan. I know my aunts are coming from a good place but it feels like I'm having to defend my decisions and I don't know what to do. \n\nI don't know if I'm looking for advice, or just needing to vent to anyone willing to listen.

Who's gonna grieve with me when mom dies? When dad dies? Who's gonna hold my hand through it all?

Your suicide meant that you worked so hard to be happy, to be okay, but you couldn't survive the fight. But I know you did, sis. I know you worked so hard for so many years to make it through this fight. I don't blame you for not being able to do it. I know it's hard for me too at times.*\n\n*I am learning how to love fiercely, to be brave in my passion, and to live a life worth living, to be smart and efficient, to be the best \"me\". You told me that we have to make the most of it while we have it good now, even when good isn't that great. I wish we could have had that adventure I wanted to take you on, Lena. I wish I could have taken you to Switzerland.*\n\n*Fuck, I miss you. But I'm going to work this out, I'm going to go get help, and I'm going to be better. I want your story to always live on, Lena.

I was 15, he was 24.  My brother had issues with drugs and his step-dad had a restraining order against him because of his behavior when he was high. Before the drugs became a big thing he and his step dad were very close, the restraining order was more of a scare tactic than anything else. At the end of my brothers life he started reading the Bible and became obsessed with the book of revelations. I don\u2019t know anything about the Bible or any of its parts so I can\u2019t say exactly what this means but he was convinced that myself and his grandmother were saviors and the people \u201cholding us back\u201d were devils. Eventually he went to his mom and step dads house for whatever reason and his step dad ended up calling the police, my brother tried to leave and the police blocked his car at the end of the street, deployed dogs &amp; tasers, and then shot him over a dozen times, killing him in front of his mother. My childhood was extremely traumatic and I struggle with a dissociative disorder, so I kind of blocked out this pain for years and years. I have been working with a therapist to deal with my grief, and in this political climate it\u2019s extremely hard to speak openly about my grief given the nature of his death. I do take issue with the police who killed him and the police force as an entity, but I wish that in my grief people didn\u2019t feel free to use it as a jumping off point to berate me about my feelings towards police or to talk about police at all. Sometimes I wish I could *just* grieve my brother. But it never happens. He was an incredibly loving person with tons of dreams and I wish he had access to the help he needed to get there. In my life of abuse &amp; neglect he was always there. Always checking in, always doing the little things. He was my only source of love and I lost him.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

{"post_id": "e92yiy", "created_utc": 1576042890, "title": "13 Years Too Long", "author": "d-lizabeth", "self_text": "My uncle, who was also my godfather died in July 2006. He was my most favorite person in the whole world. I want to share the story of my experiences with him and how I'm feeling now. His birthday was last week, so lots of feelings are resurfacing. For context: I was a very sensitive child and very mature for my age, he died when I was 6 years old. \n\nMy family is VERY close. We all lived down the same street, and my uncle and I were neighbors. He would often come to the kitchen window, knock on it so my mother would open it, and holler my name. I'd come running from the other side of the house to see him. He would often bring me gifts for doing well in school.\n\nI went to my grandmother's down the street after school every day because my mother was a teacher at a school about 30 mins away from home. Everyone, like my grandpa, uncle, aunt, and mother would be getting off of work at the same time. We would all sit on the porch as they smoked their end-of-the-day cigarettes. My uncle had a little swing installed next to his chair on the porch so he could push me while they all talked. He was always the first to greet me and call me by his pet name for me, \"Lulu.\" \n\nHis house was the messiest place. There was junk everywhere and it reeked of cigarettes. He would let me search his house and in between his sofa cushions for loose change, and he always sent me home with cups full of change for my piggy bank, telling me \"Put it in your college fund, Lulu.\"\n\nHe had surgery on his vocal cords once and wasn't allowed to speak, so he used a pad and paper to speak. He had been out shopping one day with my aunt and maybe saw a toy or something in a shop and wrote down \"Reminds me of \\[My Name\\].\" (Sorry, I don't really share my name on here.)\n\nHe let me rut up his yeard with my Barbie Jeep and even gave me sunglasses to wear while I drove it.\n\nHe let me go home in the middle of the night without frustration when I woke up wanting my mother.\n\nHe fought for custody of his children, whose mother was an abusive drug addict. He died before he saw the end of that, and it only ended in pain for the whole family.\n\nHe got me the Christmas presents I always asked for but never expected to actually get.\n\nHe stood up for the good things, and he fought the bad things.\n\nHe worked hard, and his hands were often dirty. They were also very calloused. \n\nHe was my grandfather's only son, my only uncle, my mother's only brother, my cousins' only father and step-father.\n\nHe chain-smoked and had a gravelly voice, he gave the best hugs, he told the funniest jokes, he was the most caring, most friendly soul, he was loved by many, he was gone too soon. He held my family together, and things went so downhill after he died. I often think about how different things would be now if he hadn't died. \n\nHe loved dragons, and when he went into the hospital, my mother got him a cigarette lighter shaped like a dragon where the fire comes out of the dragon's mouth. He never got to use it.\n\nTwo days before he died, he felt chest pains. He went to the doctor, and the doctor wrote off his worries about heart problems (they run in my family). He misdiagnosed him with something minor and sent him home. The next day, he felt worse. \n\nMy parents brought me to the movies that day. What I didn't know was that my whole family was worried about him and trying to take care of him that day.\n\nThat evening, he felt like he couldn't breathe and had sharp pains in his chest. My grandparents, mother, aunt, and his fiancee rushed him to the hospital. They took a while to tend to him there. They finally got him to an elevator to get him to the floor where the heart stuff is. He died on the way up. \n\nMy mother woke me in the middle of the night to tell me he passed, and I didn't cry. I just said, \"I know, I saw it in my dream.\"\n\nI will never forget the last thing he said to me. \"Bye, Lulu. Come give me a kiss. I'll see you later.\" I never saw him again. \n\nI wasn't allowed to go to the funeral. My mother didn't want me to remember him cold and dead in a casket, and for that, I am thankful. I hear that, for visitation, there was a line from inside the church that ended up going outside and wrapping around. He touched the lives of that many. He was so cherished.\n\nI remember the gathering afterward at my grandparents' house. There was fruit and cake and flowers, and I didn't understand why we were having a \"party\" when he was gone.\n\nMy mother cried every day for about a year. I didn't understand death, I was 6, so I never cried.\n\nI remember asking when I could go and see him again. I remember my mom explaining why I couldn't.\n\nNow that I'm older, I feel the loss so heavily. Now, I understand. Now, it hurts. I've never met anyone with \"delayed grief,\" but here I am. I always wonder what he would think of me now, if he would be proud of me, what advice he would give me, how he would have intervened in my and my family's lives. I wish I could say I don't cry about it often, but I do.\n\nI remember him most when I see orange butterflies. If he'd come back as anything, I think it would be that. \n\nUncle: I hope I will see you later. I miss you more than I can say.

Being from an Asian household, mental health isn't really much talked about and I had gotten more anxious whilst studying for university, but swept it off as if it was nothing, which was what is expected. I was in so much pain I thought I was having a heart attack even though I'm a healthy 19 year old. Well, at first I thought it was just indigestion. However I found myself panicking over it at night and just remember lying there in bed too scared to fall asleep in case I wouldn't wake up again. After a few rounds of vomiting, my flatmate calls 111, they send ambulance and everything was fine, my vitals were normal and they concluded it with mild anxiety. My parents still don't know about this.\n\nThings were fine and I was enjoying summer until I found that I had to resit one of my exams. That was completely fine, I was expecting to resit more than just one module to be honest. In my opinion the exam went quite alright, but I was so stressed I caught a cold and had a high temperature whilst taking the exam. Results come out and I've failed first year, sucks balls but I had to get over it to take the next step. I'm not too sure whether it's because I always try to bury it so I could plan what I can do about it that I end up feeling constantly suffocated. I keep spending nights not being able to sleep until 3am as I'd just lay there overthinking.\n\nWhen things seemed like it was lightening up on me and I actually knew vaguely what I wanted to do, UCAS applications are almost done, life decides to hit me with another hurdle. My grandma had been my very first teacher in life, the family member who accepted and loved me no matter what and is one of the strongest woman I knew. She was the one who taught me how to write with a pen and pencil, how to hold a pen and a spoon back when my mum would be working. She was the one who taught me how to write Chinese, how to paint with acrylics, how to fold origami rabbits and how to play the piano. I still remember so vividly her laughing so happily when I got scared at the ghost stories she told me. Over the recent years, her health was declining, we all knew that. This strong strong woman, could do an intestinal surgery and overcome her very bad enteritis in her late seventies. This very surgery was the start of us witnessing this strong woman weaken.\n\nMy grandma was still very bright and very intelligent, but was confined to sitting on her bed as she got too weak to walk. The previous foodie had become someone who couldn't even eat anything other than mostly boiled vegetables as her digestive system was still very bad. Eventually, she also had heart complications and was only skin on bone. Still, her mental state was extremely well and when we wheeled her to her piano, she still remembered and could play all those pieces I used to listen to.\n\nI've never seen my mother cry until this morning when I woke to her asking me to help her book plane tickets. It was so sudden, she had a chest infection and was in hospital only the day before or so, her heart was too weak for them to give her anything to help her with it and she didn't want another surgery. She was in her nineties. In a way I wanted to say it was a good thing, she didn't have to suffer for longer than she did, but I also feel so much guilt. I feel guilt because I never properly got to say goodbye, I feel like I could've spent so much more time with her. She's in another country, but I had the chance to visit. I had gone back over Christmas last year, but spent most of the time meeting with family friends outside, only coming to her flat in the morning and evenings. I had the chance to return again this October, but due to my pride, not wanting to go back and explain why I wasn't at uni, I made all these excuses about not being able to leave my summer-now-permanent job. I could've spent a month of the last few months of her life with her, but I didn't. I have never feel more regret and guilt in my life than now and I can't do anything about it. I can't even go back to go to her funeral due to plane ticket prices and I can't take time off work.\n\nI feel guilty about everything. I feel guilty about my grandma, I feel guilty about having to worry my parents about uni for the second time, I feel guilty for not doing my best in everything when I had the chance to. I guess this teaches me a lesson that I really shouldn't take things for granted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just wanted her to see me graduate. I don't know how to move on.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Frankly, if you asked me how I'd react to such news beforehand, I'd tell you I'd just collapse entirely. The relationship between me and mother was special, and everyone who saw us understood how close we were. Out of her three children, I was the only one that both respected her and didn't disappoint her. My sister's irresponsible and reckless behavior became a constant issue of consternation between the both of us, so did my brother's apathy and callousness towards mom, which stemmed from the divorce 16 years previous.\n\nMy mother lived a wild lifestyle, and it concerned me for the better part of the last decade. Her new husband didn't provide stability for her, and she couldn't provide it for herself. As frustrated as I was at the time that my mother was helpless and unable to fend for herself, I couldn't let her end up in the gutter. In spite of her faults, she was the single-most responsible person behind every great moment in my childhood, and she raised me into the type of person I am. She got herself addicted to pain medication back between 2004-2009, and, as I think back at it, I realize it could've ended right then and there so easily. It was hard being her son back then. I remember still how lonely and abandoned I felt half the time coming home from freshmen year of high school to find her passed out on the couch from her pills, unreachable when I needed her the most. Additionally, it was speculated that she was using speed throughout that period all the way up to her death, but she never would admit to it. Certain things she was open about, other things not so much. She managed to kick her habit with pain pills, so she was self-aware of how her habits could affect others.  Regardless of everything, in spite of everyone telling me that I had no business being caretaker for my mother, I couldn't let her end up uncared for if no one else would step up to it. I didn't care what she put me through, she was still my mom. She was my best friend. \n\nWe lived with each other from 2009 to 2015. In exchange for being allowed to stay rent-free, she'd cook and clean for me. During that time, we remained close to one another and helped each other out, but I started pining for more out of life. In 2015, I decided to move in with a friend in the city and start the process to join the Army, but that meant that mom would be kicked from the house. Doing that was the hardest thing for me. I felt so guilty, but it was the only way for me to gain any significant advancement in life. \n\nUnexpectedly, she ended up back in her hometown living in a house furnished by her mother. After about ten years of having an icy relationship, they mended things and, shortly thereafter, became the close mother-daughter couple that they once were. I finally found footing in my own life and, once I got settled into a new house, I invited mom to come back, but she declined. She admitted that she'd rather live somewhere else than the podunk little town she was in, but she wanted to stay to care for her elderly mother. Once that was no longer necessary, she'd presumably would then live with me. I kept a room open for her when the time came, but it never would. \n\nMom was diagnosed with COPD just last Feburary, which wasn't too shocking for me. Her breathing was becoming more noticeably labored for the past several years and her appearance was becoming more haggard and frail as a result. At first, I just contributed her declining appearance to residual side-effects from her West Nile Virus from 2003 which, like her pill addiction, nearly killed her. I also told people it's because of her smoking and just plain aging, but, after her death, a lot of things started to make sense way too much and way too late. My mother was seriously ill. I'd call her and ask about her COPD, and she'd tell me that she was cutting sodium from her diet after finding out that sodium causes her to get wheezy. She kept the impression that she had a good hand on things and wouldn't speak too much about her health problems, but I later found out from her close friend that she had so much difficulty breathing at one point that she asked her to bring oxygen canisters from her house that belonged to her friend's mother so that she could breath better at night. She never told me or her mother about it. She didn't want people worrying about her, especially us. \n\nEven though we were 5 hours driving time away, she was still an active and present person in my life. I'd call her every single night right after I got off work at midnight. Literally every single day started with me hearing my mother's voice and telling her that I loved her.  Those calls were so ordinary and routine that I can't recall exactly what we talked about just thirty-six hours before she was found dead. What I do know is that, like always, I told her that I loved her, and she told me the same. She started to suffer from an exacerbation of symptoms with her COPD and, according to those who were there, refused to seek medical attention. She insisted she had things under control. The doctor who signed the death certificate explained that the oxygen content in her body fell below a certain threshold and, once it did, she fainted and collapsed. As her oxygen content continued to drop, her body shut down. Hypoxic respiratory failure as a consequence of emphysema. She was 56. I was 30. One week I was talking to her as I did countless times before, and here I was seven days later pushing her casket in a hearse. I never felt so lost in my life. One thing I'm happy for is that, for the last three years of her life, she not only was in a position where she was cared for, but she also reconnected with her mother. Those two women were who made me, and I tried so hard to get those two back together. My favorite two photos are of us [back in 1992](https://imgur.com/a/PDXq1gS), when I was still a child, and [us in 2017](http://imgur.com/a/HeJELJk), just 25 years later. \n\nThe month before she died, we gathered for the last time for grandmother's 80th birthday. I remember being in my formal Army attire, making a point to drag mom around and introducing her to everyone I could, telling people \"she made me who I am.\" I wanted people to value her just as I did. More to the point, I wanted people to see that, no matter what she did in the past, she had a son who was so immensely proud of her and I wanted people to see that, if this young guy in a soldier outfit was this woman's son, she must've something right. Two days after she died, while standing in front of her house lost in thought, a truck pulled up unexpectedly. A big man with a beard and a naked lady tattoo walks out, looking like the kind of people my mother hung out with, and immediately recognized who I was. He walked to me and said \"I'm so sorry about your mom. She would get us things she'd find in dumpsters and fix them up. We got a lamp from her that she gave us. She was really proud of you.\" I broke down. Although things ended so abruptly, the thing I fought for so much had been won. People finally appreciated my mom the way I did. Yes, it was over, but I won. \n\nMom didn't want a long, drawn-out death. Her ideal way of dying was quick and painless (and I was assured that's what happened) because she couldn't stand the idea of slowly becoming weaker and being unable to enjoy life. She also didn't want to be a burden most of all. Her wish was fulfilled. Another thing I take comfort in is that, knowing her, the last thing she'd want is for me or anyone else to stay sad for her being gone. She thrived off of the happiness of others, and so she'd want everyone to get back to having fun and enjoying life. That's how I carry on. \n\nI didn't mean this to be this long. If you read this far, you've done more than what I expected. I just needed to get this out. Thanks for reading.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I don\u2019t know when the world started stealing it from you. People are cruel. \n\nWhen you were little, you were very selfish and it was stressful but I just weathered it. I knew it was because of  the selfish narcissist that shared half your chromosomes. You bloomed late and you were so thoughtful and caring and trying to understand other people so much more. I think it ended up where you let certain people take advantage of you because you were learning late. I can\u2019t help but hate those people. The ones who discount you, your importance, the ones who say they have no memories of you???? Wtf? The ones who are supposed to be your family yet do nothing in your memory. Do they do anything in your memory? Your a young man who\u2019s life was cut short and as long as I\u2019m breathing and able, I will honor your memory; do anything I can to give meaning to the life you lived; to keep your memory alive. I spend the energy I would have spent still being your mother on this new journey: the life you lived.  If you were here, you\u2019d be creating your own legacy. You wouldn\u2019t want your life or death to mean nothing and touch no one. You weren\u2019t here long enough to impart a legacy on the masses so I am here to impart it on anyone who will listen or participate. Finding your family members and friends willing to participate is truly lacking. Your significance did not end in your death. You aren\u2019t to be forgotten. Your memory won\u2019t be put in a closet or attic to let the dust gather. \n\nIf you don\u2019t understand legacy, please read the definition to its end. \n\nThe Definition of Legacy:\nThe dictionary would define Legacy as a gift or a bequest, that is handed down, endowed or conveyed from one person to another. It is something descendible one comes into possession of that is transmitted, inherited or received from a predecessor. It is to cause or allow something originating from an ancestral source to spread between people or provide something freely and naturally.\n\nLegacy:\n\nOften when you think about legacy, it\u2019s something that is left behind after a person has passed. Legacy is more about sharing what you have learned, not just what you have earned, and bequeathing values over valuables, as material wealth is only a small fraction of your legacy. A more holistic definition of legacy is when you are genuinely grounded in offering yourself and making a meaningful, lasting and energizing contribution to humanity by serving a cause greater than your own. The requirements of a legacy are that you embrace your uniqueness, passionately immersing your whole self into life so that your gift will be to all and that you take responsibility to ensure that it will have a life beyond that of you, its creator, outliving and outlasting your time on earth.\n\nLegacy germinates unity consciousness, is not an entity but an ongoing activity and is what you do between here and eternity. The lens of legacy gives you a view of your life from a generational perspective, where you become aware of the desire to live beyond yourself, focused on making a difference in the lives of others and giving back. The legacy you leave is the life you lead and therefore legacy is the residue of a life well lived. Your life matters as everything that you say and do is a deposit into your legacy. Creating your legacy is a pathway resulting in a deep sense of significance, where true meaning is found somewhere beyond the pursuit of success, which results in a ripple effect that positively impacts society. Inherently, when you shift to living your legacy, your influence comes from who you are authentically at the core and you measure value and life purpose other than by emphasis on accomplishments, wealth, recognition, prestige, acclaim, power or position.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He felt that the pain of the process just wasn\u2019t giving him a reasonable quality of life in return. He died a week later, and it was not peaceful. He was having nightmare hallucinations to the end, as far as we could tell. (From what I can tell, this is unusual for death from kidney failure \u2014 normally people just slip away. But that didn\u2019t make it any easier to watch in this case.)\n\nYesterday, we learned that our cat was also in kidney failure. We had taken her to the vet on Tuesday because she had lost weight and, over the weekend, seemed to have a sudden drop in energy. When the blood tests came back, the vet called my husband and told him she was in kidney failure, and to get her to the emergency vet hospital right away.

So I received all his belongings, including dozens of journals, most of them I've found date from around the time I was born until I was about 15 or 16, two or so years before he died. \n\nThe older ones when I was a baby and little have very sweet passages in them. He recalls taking me out for ice cream, going to the park, loving how I rush to the door to see him when he comes home from work. But these same journals have entries showing a man I didn't know: someone constantly angry and constantly drinking. I saw him drunk a handful of times growing up, every time was terrifying, as he'd scream and curse at my mother, blast music that kept us up all night. As a kid I thought he was just someone who drank rarely, but when he did, he got out of control, and that was the reason I had only seen him drunk a few times: he couldn't handle his liquor. The journals show day after day he writes as he's been drinking, the handwriting gets sloppy, he gets angry. He calls my mother (his wife) horrible names, a slob, a pig, disgusting. He hates her, he wants to leave her, he's so unhappy. Reading these things have hurt me beyond what I can express in words. I did not know he was an alcoholic or so deeply unhappy. I truly had no idea. \n\nHe would go to his workspace in the basement at night after work and be down there for hours which is where he'd write. I'd usually call down the stairs to him when I was going to bed and he'd come up to kiss me goodnight. Maybe once or twice I could smell beer on his breath but I never remember him drunk or angry. I remember him as responsible and reliable but have read passages detailing him being too drunk to pick me up from an elementary school sports game - stuff I do not remember but now alters my childhood. He has constant mentions to sex and pornography (barf) which disgusts me, obviously. For a long time I actually wondered while growing up if he was gay or even asexual, I never saw an inkling that he had any sort of attraction to anything. Yeah, I need brain bleach after the things I've found and seen after his death-- definitely not gay or asexual lol. \n\nIt's been hard on me to realize someone I love seemed to struggle so much. I debated throwing out the journals because when I open one, I never know what I'm going to read: sweet things about me growing up or hateful things or disgusting mentions to \"x-rated stuff\". I could open a journal and be moved to tears by how lovingly he writes about missing his mom \"in heaven\" or in tears because as I'm getting older, he fears I'm turning into a failure and not the way he imagined I'd be. I can hear his voice in his writing, so throwing them out would losing him again in a way, yet I'm not sure he'd want me to read what he wrote.\n\nI haven't told anyone what I've found (except on reddit) because I don't want the people who knew him to think of him differently--because it's hard to have respect for a man who writes such hateful and disgusting things. I don't want anyone to remember him as anything other than kind, generous, and good. He loved animals and nature, art and books. He'd go out of his way to help people. \n\nI won't even tell my therapist. \n\nSo I've carried it alone.\n\nI wrote my dilemma here and everyone said such supportive things. Thank you to anyone who remembered this post and commented. \n\nAnyway I had a dream last night that I had a journal in my hand and was looking at it. He came over to me and peered at what I was reading. \"I can't believe I wrote such things\" he said. He shook his head in disapproval and then gently ripped out a page that had something nasty in it. He didn't take the journal from me, he let me continue holding it in my hands. I don't remember him saying \"I'm sorry\" but in the dream it was clear he was apologetic. Towards the end of the dream I had moved on to doing something else, but saw him again, this time he had the journal and was ripping out another page. He wasn't violently ripping up the book or setting it on fire: just pulling out a few pages that I guess contained anything negative or hurtful. It kind of made me feel like: it's okay to read the journals but don't pay much attention to the bad, \"discard it\" it wasn't truly him, it wasn't truly how he felt. \n\nI don't dream of him often but it made me feel better and I had to share.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My older sister and I used to see my dad every Sunday, I loved going, he would take us on days out, car trips, beach adventures, it was the best of times. After splitting up with my Mum, he moved back in with my Grandma and Grandad who we saw every week too. I loved my Sundays, my dad was your typical dad, loved rock and roll, loved playing guitar, loved Photoshop, and especially loved taking pictures and writing poems. We even joined a poetry group together. I loved the bones of him. \n\nWhen I was around 9/10, we used to go for drives together and we'd go the local offy and he would get a few cans and would always get me a Smirnoff Ice or a WKD. At the time, I thought it was so cool, I shared my dad with my sister but I'm having quality time with him driving around singing songs and the drinking never occurred to me at that age. It stopped when I was around 13 and I understood this wasn't normal, but he never seemed to drink again after that. I was told a lot later that he did have a problem with drink here and it had been going on for years and never stopped. \n\nWhen I was around 15, he joined a band who played local gigs in his home town, he loved music and guitars so this was a dream come true. At the same time, my eldest sister got into a relationship with the drummer of the band, one of my dad's friends. I knew she went out quite a lot with them all, and I didn't really mind because I wasn't at a drinking age. But one night, something happened, I still haven't been told to this day, but something happened between my dad, my sister and her fella. Drink related, I assume. And from then on, my sister cut all contact. Around the same time, my dad got mugged and I went to visit him and he was a completely different person, he had suffered from brain damage and his whole personality was different, I was scared and I stopped seeing him for a few months. I don't know if if was also because of what was going on with my sister. There was some people telling me to see him, and some people telling me not too.\n\nAnyway, I kept in contact with him, visited a few times after that, nothing like how it used to be, everytime I'd go around all he would ask for was my sister, it was like he didn't want anything to do with me. I was begging for attention and all he wanted/asked for was my eldest sister. He never seemed interested in my life, or what I was talking about, I was angry, I just wanted my dad to pay attention to me. The drinking problem had become a very big problem, and it was showing. He was an alcoholic and I didn't know how to deal with it. \n\nBetween being 15 and 18, I visited every now and then and we'd speak every day on Facebook or telephone. He never made the effort to come and see me and I was angry, so I stopped making the effort with him. I become pregnant with my youngest when I was 18, and I thought I could never put drink before this child, so how can he do it to me. (I understand its an addition, but I was so so angry with him.) He begged to see his grandchild, so we met up at a local shop, and it was lovely. It was like my old dad was back, he was sober, my grandma and Grandad was telling me how he was saving up to get a flat and things was back on track. Great, we kept in contact again, talking every day, and he would relapse time and time again, he would disappear and no one would know where he was, and even though my mum had divorced him years  before, it was always her that would go and help find him. \n\nI'm ashamed to say it now, but I didn't want an unstable drunk around my child. He still would only ask for my sister, and would still disappear for months on end without telling anyone, unable to contact him anyway. Around 2014, I was 22 and my daughter was 2 and i had kept in contact with my dad maybe 2/3 times a month through Facebook messenger when he had send me an email saying my grandma had called me and my sister a bunch of slabs and they don't want nothing to do with us. It came out of no where, I was shocked and angry and I ignored the message. That was November 2014. Beginning of December 2014, he messaged me apologising and asking have we fallen out. I replied no, not fallen out. A couple of days later, I messaged him saying hey dad! Which never got delivered. \n\nI rang him on the 18th December, wishing him a merry Christmas and asking did he want to meet up and put everything in the past. He agreed, and he sounded like him old self. I remember ringing him when I could tell he was drunk, but he sounded like my old dad. We chatted for hours and organised a day to meet up. 10th January 2015, my mum woke me up and told me he had died. I was, and still am heartbroken.\n\nI'm so angry and guilty at myself, for not being there to help him or to fix him, if I'd have visited more he might have stopped drinking. If I'd have been there for him, he might still be with me now. I can't cope with it all, and I'm struggling.\n\nAfter he died, I vowed to make sure the same didn't happen with my Grandma and Grandad and I kept in weekly contact with them, seeing them as much as I could. My grandad died last week, and it was his funeral today. And it's all come flooding back. I'm absolutely heartbroken and I don't know where to go from here. It'll be 5 years in January, and the pain hurts more than it did then. My chest hurts whenever I think about him and all the what ifs. \n\nWhere do I go from here? \n\nThank you, if you got this far.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

She died from lung cancer when I was 26 years old. It took me literal years to recover from her passing. I was so filled with grief and sorrow it took over a good portion of my life. I have been working my way through the stages of grief slowly, and finally found myself in a state of acceptance this year. It was very nice! Until it wasn\u2019t anymore...\n\nNow that I\u2019m no longer overwhelmed with sadness, I\u2019m remembering things from my adolescence that are making me angry. \n\nWhen I was young, from like age 5 until I moved out at 19, my schizophrenic abusive uncle lived with us. He would hit me and scream and embarrass me in front of my peers on a regular basis. I begged and pleaded for my mom to kick him out. He didn\u2019t pay any rent, he ate our food, posted pornographic posters and calendars all over the walls, and he made my life miserable. I stopped speaking to him when I was 15 years old, even though I saw him/was in the same room with him daily. \n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t understand why my mom refused to protect me from this man! I have a 13 year old boy now, and I would beat someone senseless if they touched him the way he touched me! They would absolutely be out of my house and out of my life. No questions asked. He is a child and it\u2019s my responsibility to protect him. I would beg her and say that I was a child, she would reply that I \u201cwasn\u2019t acting like a child\u201d and therefore I deserved to be hit? Yelled at? Humiliated and abused? I guess so. I just don\u2019t understand and it\u2019s making me angry. I think about asking her why and I know exactly her response, \u201cOH Michelle, can\u2019t you just let it go already?!\u201d I know for a fact that\u2019s what she would say. And then she would justify it by saying that he was sick and needed her help. \n\nSo all these feelings of anger and resentment also come with additional feelings of shame and embarrassment. I believe in an afterlife and I believe my moms soul is still with me, and that she can hear my thoughts and prayers. I feel embarrassed that she knows I\u2019m having these thoughts. Maybe it\u2019s a result of years of gaslighting, but I think to myself \u201cwhat if she\u2019s annoyed with me from heaven because she still doesn\u2019t believe there was anything wrong with what happened to me? What if I\u2019m disappointing her and she thinks I\u2019m lying/making all of this up?\u201d \n\nIdk, I think I sound a little crazy right now but I\u2019m just trying to navigate these new feelings after years of only remembering her as a perfect and adoring mother, as I did in my grief.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He never stopped being a kitten. I'd never seen a grown cat retain the personality of a kitten before, and bring so much light and happiness into my life and to the other cats around him. \n\nWe live in an area that's not entirely safe, in the country where there's coyotes. There's always this risk, and I've lost pets to disappearance before, but this has broken my heart like nothing else ever. We have quite a few cats, so we can't keep them all inside at night and we have a fenced-in backyard. On the night of December 1st, I put him out. It's supposed to be safe, and I had every belief it was. The last thing I said to him was, teasingly, \"I'm gonna be mean\" because I was putting him out. \n\nI haven't seen him since, and I know what happened. \n\nThere was apparently a hole in the fence and I'm guessing that's how he got out. The thing is is I almost didn't put him out that night, I almost decided to be lazy and cheat and let him stay in. If I'd just made one different decision he'd still be here. I know I wasn't negligent and I had no idea he would escape, but it was still my actions that led to this. Never in my life have I felt guilt like this before. \n\nIt's been ten days now. I'm past the hysterical crying and the most agonizing guilt, but there's still a fog over everything. Even when I'm feeling normal there's this feeling of there being something wrong with the world, something isn't right. He's not here and he's supposed to be. He was supposed to live for years. And I can't even say a proper goodbye.\n\nLess than two weeks ago he was sleeping on my bed in front of my space heater. This time feels so close and yet I can't touch it. I can't go back and fix it and make that one different decision that would bring him back.\n\nMy life has been split into before and after. If I even watch a Youtube video was posted in September I think 'that's when Truffle was still here.' This Thanksgiving was great, I had a nice time and went out with my family and got a new coffee mug and comic. Just mere days before he disappeared, and now these things will always be tainted because it preceded all this.\n\nA few nights ago I dreamed he came back, super slim from being on his own, and I so happy but terrified I was dreaming and kept saying random words to myself to prove I was conscious in the real world because I can think like a waking person. Then I closed my eyes for a bit longer than a normal blink and woke up in my bed. \n\nI still look outside hopeful for him, but know the chances are very low especially the more time goes on. There's no real relief from the pain. No matter how normal and okay I can feel, even most of the day, I'm reminded of him constantly.

It started when I finished EMT school. The day I got my certification my grandpa died of an aneurism while he was working in his alfalfa field. He was a loving, amazing man, and a great mentor. He was in his 80\u2019s and died doing what he loved, working his fields. \n\nA few weeks later my first CPR; a 4 year old boy fell into a bucket and drowned.  His babysitter called 911, but there was not thing we could do by the time we got there.\nI bottled this for awhile, but eventually grieved and moved on.  There were many more CPR calls, death is a big part of EMS. It\u2019s been hard, but not overwhelming.\n\nIn 2017 my little sister (30) died from cardiomegaly and heroin toxicity. We were very close, and she was always a bright spot in my life. She had 6 kids. I\u2019m helping raise one now. He\u2019s another bright spot, an amazing kid.\n\nAbout 6 months later my best friend was shot in the stomach moving a loaded handgun (along with other loose items in a box) into his new house.  His 6yo daughter found him the next day, along with his parents. He was in too much pain, and suffered too much blood loss to call 911.\n3 other friends also lost their lives in this period, I won\u2019t go into detail, but they were all hard loses.  \n\nThis is were I know I need help.  I just don\u2019t know how to process this all.  My wife has been amazing, she has also lost loved ones and at a young age, she\u2019s been nothing but supportive. But it all still overwhelms me. Sometimes I go out with friends, have 2 drinks and immediately want to leave.  I cry about once a month, sometimes more. I know therapy is an option, but does it work? How have you coped? Does this get better?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

When my dad saw my mom for the last time, she was intubated and the visit in the ICU could last merely 5 minutes before we had to be on our own in the room. It was busy. People have been around, arrangements to be settled, others to call to tell them she had passed. Then the funeral, then the memorial. Then it all stopped. Between moving to a new place, packing things, and reality hitting me when I pick up photos of her, her writing in my engagement guest book, where she wishes us to be together through thin and thick. Suddenly I panic and realise she's gone. Then I see her in my dream and she's..she's just there. On Christmas it will be a month. A month since the call from the hospital I dreaded of the longer and worse she was getting. I didn't know last year would be our last together. I didn't. I didn't know. Now it's all together. The funeral came crushing down on us, the recovery for dad, bills she pilled up as she was working despite the doctors telling her not to. A lot of \"ifs\". I don't think I have grieved just because I had to take care of everything from details to just take care of my dad like she asked me. Now I just sit in silence sometimes and cry. Then it stops, I realize I have to be the one to do the things she used to, and idk how. I wish she could be here and tell me. Like she used to. \nI remember when I set the funding page telling her we will settle things once she's out of the hospital for Christmas, we will settle the mortgage for the apartment and she would get the pension for the years she worked, she told me..\"I'm embarrassed to let people know\". Three weeks later I just feel to lost on what to do. Coping is hard. And this wasn't used for her memorial expenses or the tombstone..this would be their aid. https://www.giveandfund.com/giveandfund/project/RecoverySupport", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

They had just moved to a new house and gotten a new puppy as well and he wasn\u2019t dealing with the changes very well. During a grooming appointment he became extremely aggressive and though I\u2019m not sure 100% on the details of what happened, he suffer damage to his trachea as a result and suffered for a week before he eventually passed away from the complications.\n\nAlthough he was nearly 12 years old and likely wouldn\u2019t have lived much longer anyway his death was still sudden and seemed unnecessary due to its nature being completely preventable. He didn\u2019t die of old age like we thought he would, he died of injury. \n\nSo my stepmother was sad about it, we were all sad about it. It\u2019s still sad, it has only been three months since he passed. But I\u2019m beginning to understand just how sad she is about the entire thing.\n\nI had the idea today to get one of those custom pet portraits made of him to give for her for Christmas as I thought it would be a nice thing in the wake of a sad loss to be able to look at him. So I texted my stepsister and asked for some better photos of him than the ones I had and she told me that she believes our mother\u2019s recent health issues (she was in the hospital for a week before thanksgiving and has been having issues on and off before and since) are due to her grief over the dog dying. She said she tried to show her pictures of the dog the other day and my stepmother wouldn\u2019t even look at them. \n\nAnd I had wondered if my stepmother was making herself ill in some way and I hadn\u2019t considered that grief and depression might be physically manifesting themselves and causing her issues but now that makes perfect sense to me. But I just don\u2019t know really what to do or how to deal with that or how to help. She\u2019s very fragile and sensitive to begin with and I\u2019m not particularly fragile or sensitive. \n\nI can get behind not giving her a portrait of her dog in order to spare her from being sad but I also don\u2019t think that simply pretending he never existed and sheltering her from anything that might trigger anxiety or sadness is a useful way for her to move on. \n\nI just don\u2019t really know what to do or how to help her since she\u2019s really making herself physically sick with her mental problems. I worry that everyone walking on eggshells around her isn\u2019t going to improve the situation but I also don\u2019t want to trigger anything in her. Any advice on how to deal with a grieving person would be greatly appreciated. I love her very much and hate to see her so affected.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Two days before Thanksgiving, I got a phone call from my aunt saying that my grandfather passed away suddenly at his home. He was alone at the kitchen table when my aunt and uncle found him. It was particularly devastating and shocking because he was the only grandfather I had known and he taught me so many things about life and God (a very religious man, he was). I love him with all my might so I broke down pretty hard initially. Then I had to call my dad because he drives a truck and no one had told him yet. I had to tell him that his father had passed away and it was one of the hardest moments I\u2019ve ever experienced. \n\nDuring this time, I had been with my boyfriend for around 7 months. I know it had been a fairly short time, but I had thought we felt a connection and were in love. It was common for us to discuss our plans and future together. For some reason, I instinctively texted him (he was at work when my aunt called me) about my grandpa passing, I don\u2019t think he necessarily knew how to react because he just said that he was sorry. He usually said that but for some reason I didn\u2019t pay any mind. I wanted to talk to him after he got off work because I felt like I was having a crisis but he was tired so he went to bed and I couldn\u2019t sleep. Throughout the week, things were pretty hectic and I just felt a wide range of emotions as expected but I still made sure to text and call him to let him know what was up.\n\nThe day of the funeral comes around and it was on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, meaning I would have to miss school and work to attend. That was fine as my boss automatically knew I wasn\u2019t going to be able to come in for several days. I really wanted my boyfriend to be there for me just so I had some support during this awful time but he had to work and couldn\u2019t take off. I was understanding as he has bills and stuff needing to be paid.\n\nWell, that night I get a text from him asking if we could talk when he gets off around midnight. I said that wouldn\u2019t be a good time as today was very emotionally draining. I thought he understood and he then asked if we could talk the day after before he went to work. I said that was fine. That day comes and apparently what he wanted to talk to me about was breaking up with me. He said he was not ready to be in a relationship and was still thinking about his ex (who cheated on him and broke his heart). I was so heartbroken and angry that I couldn\u2019t speak. I just hung up and cried as I missed my grandpa and was wondering why now. I understand he wasn\u2019t ready, but if he had been feeling like this earlier, why couldn\u2019t he tell me?

To listen. No judgment. No expectations for you, but in total support to the other person. This has been me for my mom the past day or so. My grandpa is 87, and he's loving but stubborn and always put everyone before himself. He called yesterday earlier than he ever does to say he needed to go to the hospital. Trouble breathing and general discomfort. We took no chances and rushed to him and got an ambulance. He's stable and resting in the hospital. \n\nI went to visit him again after work tonight. Just me. My mom, dad, and Grandma had checked on him and visited earlier. He told me the doctor came after they left and he couldn't understand much of what was happening but just doesn't want an operation. He doesn't want to chance something going wrong and that's how he passes. That happened to his neighbor, a good friend, and it's haunted him for a few years. He wants \"to go out with what he came in with.\" I don't blame him. He's lived a long life, seen a lot, and been through a lot. No extra machines. Just him. Being Christmastime, it's tough on all of us not knowing how much time is left. Him, too, but he doesn't show it. I've always loved him and been proud of him, and I know he's only thinking about all of us. \n\nI just wanted to share this...being there for mom, for him, for the whole family. It's a process. I guess I'm learning to grieve the usual life I've known. And for now I'll keep doing what I can. There's so much love around us...and it's going to continue. \n\nPeace and hope to everyone out there in whatever stage of grief you find yourself. Keep being there.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My husband and I decided to visit a reproductive endocrinologist after years of failing to get pregnant on our own. We began with less invasive treatment (IUI), but after many more failures it was recommended that we try IVF.  So in October of 2018 we started our first cycle. It was early November when we found out our cycle was a total fail. The very next day was November 8th. This date might not be significant to all of you, but for us and many others it was a complete nightmare.\n\nIn the morning I heard the news that there was a fire near Paradise.  Not a huge cause for concern, there are fires in that area all the time, I went back to work.  The next time I checked the news it was horrific. I immediately became concerned for my husband\u2019s family who all still lived in Paradise, his mother, sister and brother in law, and grandparents. We were unable to reach them for most of the day and I was beside myself with worry. Finally we heard from them, everyone was safe.  We don\u2019t live in the area anymore, but immediately got in the car to make the 20 hour drive back there. That time for me is pretty much a blur, but it was decided that his mother and 98 year old grandmother would come live with us. However, this necessitated the most heartbreaking decision I\u2019ve ever seen. My husband\u2019s 100 year old grandpa had been in a nursing home on hospice before the fire. They evacuated him to a home in Sacramento where he could stay if needed. After a lot of discussion grandma decided that he could not make the trip to a new state. So, we took her to visit him and say goodbye. I will never be able to forget how sad it was, she held his hand and wept while he in his dementia had no idea what was happening. They had been married for 77 years and she knew she would never see him again. \n\nAfter that we began our slow drive home. It\u2019s funny how sometimes you get a little hysterical in these situations, but we all found it hilarious that it was the easiest move ever because they\u2019d escaped with just the clothes on their backs. We got back home just in time for thanksgiving, but the holidays were not very festive for anyone. In February we got the news that grandpa had died, grandma took it pretty hard that she wasn\u2019t able to be with him at the end. \n\nOne of the reasons that we brought them back to live with us was that we have an attached converted garage apartment. We had been renting it out, but gave our tenant notice that we weren\u2019t renewing her lease so we could move his family in. It seemed like it would be the best possible scenario, having them close by but everyone getting their own space. Shortly after we moved them into the apartment, grandma got really sick. We took her to the hospital and found out she had pneumonia. She refused all treatment, so they allowed us to care for her at home with hospice. About two weeks later she died. We were so sad, but also grateful that she got to die at home on her own terms.\n\nAfter grandma passed we decided maybe it was time to get into fertility treatment again. We switched to a new clinic and did three more rounds of IVF. All of them failed. The doctor made it clear that I will never have genetic children. We\u2019ve spent all the money, so adoption is out, donor egg is out, and fostering would be too heartbreaking for me if I couldn\u2019t keep the children. After that, I let the grief overwhelm me.  I attempted suicide and was hospitalized. I\u2019ve been slowly working my way back with the help of drugs and a good psychiatrist. I would not say I\u2019m better by any means, but I\u2019m no longer a danger to myself. \n\nMeanwhile, my mother in law was getting used to living on her own and not care taking for the first time in many years. She had so much fun shopping for everything she needed and decorating the apartment. They got a good insurance settlement from their house, so she\u2019s been able to really spruce up the place without worrying about money. Our one concern was that she was still neglecting her health. She has a number of health issues, including scoliosis and chronic pain, but she had pushed them aside for many years while caring for her parents. In addition to that she now has what I\u2019m sure is PTSD from the fire, they had a harrowing escape during which she saw a burned body. We begged and begged her to get a new doctor and take care of herself.\n\nOn Thursday my husband found her in her apartment barely able to move or speak. We rushed her to the hospital where she quickly got worse. They ran a bunch of tests and found that she had dangerously low sodium and a \u201cfinding\u201d on her lung. They\u2019ve been running more tests, but we spoke to the doctor today and he told us to prepare for the possibility of lung cancer.  I\u2019m so sad and so angry. I thought maybe we\u2019d been through the worst of it, and that she was going to get a fresh start to live life for herself, she\u2019s only 68. \n\nThanks all for reading my story, even if no one responds it\u2019s been really helpful to get it out.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I got a call from my brother and I started making plans to drive my family 15 hours to get to him.\n\n  I showed up just about an hour before he was heading in for surgery to place a stint in his heart and check for further issues.  By the time I got there he was on a ventilator.  He was in and out of consciousness but didn't seem very aware of anything.  Right before they rolled him in for surgery, he became more conscious.  Everyone was given a chance to say a couple words of encouragement to him before he was rolled in.  I was very emotional and didn't want to upset him so I stayed in the background as my brothers and mother all told him he would be okay and that they loved him.  I honestly don't think he even saw me.  \n\nHe came out of surgery ok but was kept heavily sedated and unconscious for the next week.  I spent the next 8 days at his side in the hospital before having to get my wife and kids back to our home and back into school.

He struggled with arthritis for the past few years but it gradually became a big issue and he also had dementia which took a severe turn for the worst the past month before he passed away. So my mother, sister and I booked an appointment to put him to rest, we had gotten his favorite food, some soft toys and planned we would take him for a little walk before we say goodbye because him being a German shep/border collie he loved walks even tho he couldn't run anymore. 5 days before his appointment he fell down the stairs and injured his spine. His way of walking down the stairs was he would skip the last 2 steps but this time he fell from like the 8th one. Looking back I should of never let him walk down those stairs knowing there's a chance he could fall (which is where the guilt comes from). Anyway I spent like 6hrs trying to calm him down thinking it was just his dementia because he would cry every night for the past few weeks anyway. I told my mother he was not okay and I guess she assumed I was over exaggerating. My mother suffers badly from depression and that night was one of her depressed nights. During those 6hrs max was crying non stop, panting and walking weird, he eventually fell asleep and I was crying stroking him telling him it's okay if he passes away now. He woke up and started crying again so I carried him to my room and tried to get him to rest, he continued and then we had to book an emergency appointment and I had to hold my crying max the whole ride, I remember it so well. The vet got my mother to sign all the stuff and they wanted to check him for injuries, as the crying he usually does stops when he's still. Turns out he had a spinal injury. So unknowingly I was hurting my dog by carrying him to my room. He was the best dog and the pillar of my family and I feel so bad for allowing him to walk down the stairs and cause himself the injury. The amount of guilt and grief I feel is unmeasurable, it feels like it happened yesterday even though it happened almost 10 months ago.

I have never loved anyone in the world as much as I loved her. I knew we were meant to be together the moment I saw her in the shelter, and we had 9 and a half years together. Last fall, her eye ruptured (one of the worst days of my life) and I had surgery done to save the eye and her eyesight in it. It was expensive and a lot of work to keep it stable so it could heal. The eye doctor was thrilled with the results, it turned out even better than she expected.\n\nLess than three months after Honey's surgery, my Mom, brother, and brother's girlfriend took her for a walk in the neighborhood while I had some friends visiting. It was a very quiet neighborhood and we had walked the dogs there hundreds of times. A large off-leash dog came out of nowhere and killed her. I don't know all the details, I literally can't handle it, but her neck was snapped and her abdomen torn into. The dog belonged to some of the people working at the park near our house.\n\nThis dog was everything to me. We went to corgi fairs and meet ups, she won costume contests, she was just about the sweetest dog in the world. She would try to roll over for belly rubs on the exam table at the eye clinic. She would howl with a big smile on her face and then roll over for belly rubs from random strangers on walks. We just adored each other. To me, she was the perfect being. I loved everything about her. I can't stand that her life ended this way. I desperately want to go back and fix what happened. I feel like half of my heart is gone and my reality is broken. I never got to say a proper goodbye to her. I put on the harness she died in, a harness I never saw again but I know was splattered with her blood. I never saw her body (which is for the best, I think, but makes it hard to accept). Mom came home with Honey's blood on her. My family tried punching and hitting the dog to get her out of his jaws, and when the dog let go it was too late. The sheriff took photos of her body laying there.\n\nThree months later, my other beloved corgi (who we got at the same time as Honey) suddenly went downhill and we had to put him down for an aggressive cancer. It was peaceful but unexpected, and so hard to deal with. He was only 11.\n\nIn the last year, my Mom accidentally released this very rare pheasant I had rescued and was thrilled about having (my favorite species of bird, unusual in captivity); a bunch of my very old chickens (12+ years old) died in the course of a week due to something I could have saved them from but figured out too late; we moved to a beautiful new place and the move and setting up the place has been a stressful fiasco due to being unable to find reputable help. One of my two new rescued corgis got into some Tylenol and Ibuprofen well-hidden in a suitcase and she was intensively hospitalized for almost a week. Thankfully she made a full recovery, but it was a very traumatic incident to go through, and $6,900 when I hadn't even paid off Honey's surgery yet. I don't make much money to begin with. Nonetheless, I am incredibly grateful that she's still here and healthy. My Mom's horse had a serious injury and for a while it looked like he wasn't going to make it (he's on the mend now). \n\nI just feel like I can't come to terms with what happened to Honey. It's so horrifying to me that her life ended like this. I wake up from the neutral state of sleeping and immediately think \"Honey was killed by a dog.\" And it lingers over me all day like a raincloud.\n\nShe and Hooch, my other corgi, visited me in a dream a few months ago. I try to be skeptical, but I swear it was a visit. They were so vivid and it was nothing like my normal dreams. It was a huge comfort, and symbolic, but I'm still in an extremely dark place.\n\nI'm not quite suicidal--there are a lot of things I want to do and see still in my life--but I'm not far off of it either. I desperately don't want this reality to be true. I desperately want to go back and change what happened. I desperately want her to live as long as she possibly can and die peacefully with me by her side, like I always thought would happen. I can't stand what happened to her, it feels unbearable. I basically have to live with my worst nightmare forever. It won't change no matter how much I can't handle it. It hurts almost more than I can stand.\n\nI go to counseling, I adore my two new dogs and take great care of them, I love the new place I live at now even though it still needs a lot of work. I have things to look forward to. But no matter what I do, Honey's death still feels unbearable to me. I cry nearly every day, often multiple times a day, and I feel like I'm in a haze a lot of the time. The anniversary of her death was miserable, I was in horrible physical and emotional pain. I planted a tree in her memory, but then spent the rest of the night curled up in my room alone in the dark, sobbing and hurting.\n\nShe wasn't a person, but she was the most important creature in the whole world to me. How do you cope with the sudden, awful, violent death of the one you loved most? How do you come to terms with that? I just don't know how to find acceptance or healing among my grief and horror and trauma.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

{"post_id": "ebilfz", "created_utc": 1576519219, "title": "It's been 18 months and I'm still texting my mom on a regular basis just to make it less painful", "author": "siyxx", "self_text": "This is a super long story. \n\nMy mom was diagnosed with lymphoma back in 2011. It was a regular annual check-up so she went to see the doctor alone. When the doctor declared the news, the first thing she asked was whether she would live to see my commencement day (I was in my junior year). The answer was a 'no': she had only about 4 months to live. Mom drove home by herself without shedding a single teardrop. My dad broke down when she told him.\n\nSo that's my mother. Strong as fuck. Me as her top priority forever. I was studying abroad when all this happened. One night during our Skype call, she told me she was going through a chemo. I think part of me just died when she removed the wig. Everything was so... surreal.\n\nAnyway, fast forward to the next year, she made it through (barely) and finally got to attend my graduation like she hoped to do. The cancer was gone but the whole process made her too weak to work anymore. I won't go into details for this part but let's say she decided to go stay at this retreat and learn to live humbly with a chance to study herbalism and alternative medical practices and such. Also the underlying reason was also my dad was a complicated person to live with. \n\nSo we spent the next 6 years back and forth with each other. With her condition it's quite difficult to have a normal mother-daughter routine (i.e hang out at the malls, the small silly activities we do with our moms). I was an only child so we'd always been close. Not until much later that I realized how much the whole thing has affected me right from Day 1. Without even realized, I've been mourning over her sickness and her absence from my life all along.\n\nThe lump was back in April 2017. This time it's a metastatic breast cancer, which is an absolute horrifying and gruesome thing. And I took it badly. I took it so horribly that, in fact, the regrets have been haunting me ever since.\n\nNow I think I might need to explain our situation  for a bit. We are Asian so family obligation is crucial in the socio-cultural structure. Since my mom couldn't work anymore and my dad was a freelance artist/homemaker then of course the role of a sole provider of the family has passed on to me. Again, I won't go into details but it got me severely depressed and extremely angry. I mean, I couldn't just abandon my family to start my own life. That's not even an option. But dedicating my 20s to these responsibilities hasn't been so kind to the existentialist nature of my being. Also, I couldn't just leave my mom to the looming presence of my dad who has been treating her so badly it only took a stage 4 cancer to Jumpstart him back to his sense and start acting like a proper spouse/human being.\n\nLooking at me suffering from paying all the bills taking over the mortgage and trying my best to put food on the table and keep everyone happy, my mom had made a decision not to go through a traditional treatment of chemotherapy. She didn't want to be add anymore burden. Also she went through the process before and she suffered so much. But then things happened so quickly I couldn't process them all and looking back I think I was in denial for the longest of time. Maybe even now I still am. But I digress... \n\nShe got worse in April 2018 and by then I was so depressed I went on medication for the first time. I had become her primary caretaker and, call me a naive child but the 28 year-old me had no clue how to do that. To be a good caretaker I mean.  Deep down I was hoping she could get better even though she was in so much pain. Everything was so conflicting. \n\nWhat made it so hard was that I found her love for me was unbearable. Being under the same roof with my dad was also unbearable. I was afraid I would stuck in that stage my whole life. And I projected all these angers on my mom. Yes, I treated her poorly and probably made her last days on earth so miserable she lose her will to fight. The look in her eyes was the emptiness and despair. But even then I couldn't even bring myself to be nice. \n\nWhen I was out for work, dad would take care of her. It took me the longest time to finally requested to be working from home. But mom's getting worse so quickly by the time I wanted to act right she lose an ability to speak. I felt like someone just punched my head repetitively  when it happened. I was screaming actually. \n\nIn my memory, the last time I talked to her I was just calling her over and over. When I thanked her for all the sacrifices that she did for me, she nodded vigorously. I wish I could say more, something meaningful like an apology, or all the nice memories of us but I couldn't bring myself to do so. She died the next day. \n\nGrowing up I always told people how my mom was my bestfriend. But as years go by I found her unconditional love to be more of noose around my neck. Parental love is a complicated thing. The last few months was just tortuous for everyone and some days I wondered if she even knew that I loved her more than anythinf in my life. And now that she's gone I feel like my heart was just crumbling into million pieces. The emptiness caused by her death always attacked me at the most random hours. Nobody has told me that loss would be so extremely quiet like this. It's like she was vacuumed out of my life in a blink of an eye, leaving me with this colossal void. \n\nMost days are OK, but some days such as this I wish I could do more to make her happy. I wish I could be more forgiving and kind. I wish we had more time. I seemed to check all the boxes of regrets. One might think that since I had 6 years to prepare I would take this in a more composed fashion. It's been a year and a half now and I still keep her phone number alive so I could text her like the time before this nightmare begun. \n\nOK, this just turned into a stream-of-consciousness kind of a story but I guess I just want to vent it out anonymously. If you read to this line, then I am grateful for your time and kind attention. I barely talk about her anymore, because many things have changed after her passing.

What was the final cause? Her lungs? Her heart? Her blood sugar dropping too low?\n\nThey assured me her cause of death would be on the death certificate.

That\u2019s why he did it. That\u2019s why people who commit suicide do it. They want to live so so bad that when they don\u2019t get to live they can\u2019t bear it and end it altogether.

The rooftop we lay beside each other at, the sky we stared at, the lake by my house which we sat by throwing stones and watching the ripples, the cold air of winter that touched my skin when he embraced me for the first time. Everything reminds me of you, baby. I\u2019ll go crazy if I stay in this city for too long.

I have recently realized this is a terrible and toxic mentality to have and have worked on \"softening up\"  My baby sister (26f) has been battling with drugs and alcohol. Not going to sugar coat, she pushed alot people out of her life due to her toxic tendencies and terrible decision making. \n\nI made a decision awhile ago to cut her out of my life. Two reasons, 1 it was giving me anxiety wondering if she was going to steal from me or our parents and 2nd was that all our conversations ended in yelling matches. I know she really did want to get clean and sober and my mindset was that having me yell at her wasn't a healthy or helpful solution. \n\nShe passed that past week after losing her battle with addiction and I am left with so much guilt. I always assumed we would patch things up eventually and work things out. I feel like we as a family clearly failed her or we would not be here. My parents kicked her out of the house after she continued stealing from them and she was having a rough go on the streets. I feel like she needed some tough love but sort of assumed the parents that had coddled her cause she was the baby wouldn't do the tough love thing forever. \n\nI am really struggling with this as I feel I could have been a better bigger brother. That I shouldn't have closed the door on her and instead put myself out more to help her. She was my baby sister and for us to land here, I am devastated and feel so empty inside. We held a candlelight vigil for her and I told all of the people there that despite the fact I didn't support her, I am trying to change and would support any of them. I tried to throw myself into work and even did a work trip but I ended up crying alone in my hotel room.

I'm very new to reddit so please forgive me, haha. Here goes.\n\nBefore my parents, I didnt have many experiences with close deaths. I'd had a couple great grandparents pass before age 10, a great aunt around age 18, and that's it. I'd never lost a friend or anything like that, either. I'm an only child and was raised by my mother and father. They were both HEAVY smokers and my mother was an alcoholic from when I was about 14 up until her death when I was 23. My father survived a heart attack by getting triple-bypass surgery when I was 20 (this caused me to have to drop out of school, but I still lived away from home &amp; worked instead) and he was diagnosed with multiple stage 4 cancers all over his body when I was 23. He died from cancer in December 2017, and my mother died from unknown causes February 2016. An autopsy revealed nothing, and to this day her certificate says \"natural cuases\"...she was on multplie medications for things from bronchitis to diverticulitis; after my dad's cancer diagnosis her health took a major decline as well. They both simply gave up; my dad declined getting treatment and literally chose to accept death instead. My mom dying 2 months later has always led me to feel this constant small feeling that she actually committed suicide by mixing alcohol with her meds. I'll literally never know.\n\nI loved my parents, they weren't perfect, but when my mother died, my world broke. I've always been an anxious person and have battled depression since junior high-ish. She was always there for me. She would talk on the phone when I was too afraid to. She'd answer the door when I would run upstairs at the sound of the doorbell. She was the only person in my entire life that ever encouraged my dream of drawing comics/cartoons one day as a career. She taught me what music  was. I loved her. I would call her crying when I was having a panic attack and couldn't go to work. She was the only person who never judged me. She always asked how I was, not what I was doing. Sorry for ranting.\n\nWhen my parents died, I had no idea the huge list that would come with it of all the things that need to be done...I live in the usa, and I'm an only child. Well, that's partially true. After my parents died, I found out I have 2 half siblings that live in different parts of the US. They are 10 and 20 years older than me and are from my Dad. They did not offer any sort of help at all during the funeral/afterwards and mostly just  inquired about having some of my dad's possessions. Everyone just asked me about money and things. Houses, cars. No one asked me if I was okay. Luckily I was (and still am) dating one of the kindest people on earth, and he was extremely supportive throughout the entire thing and did everything he could possibly do for me. But even then, we aren't married or anything, so he has no legal authority to help me with most of the actual work. My parents she filed for bankruptcy shortly before their deaths, so I had to finish taking care of it all. He drove me all around the state to lawyers and judges and made sure I was eating and made me feel really loved. But I was the one who legally HAD to speak to coroners, funeral directors, priests...I had to plan a funeral and decide where to bury them...I still havent decided, I just still have their urns...\n\nMy mother had 4 sisters, but all of them live in different states and have multiple other kids and their own lives etc. We would get together for Thanksgiving/Christmas, but that's virtually it.  Initially, they were very kind and offered to help in \"any way\" especially with the bankruptcy. But it seemed after the funeral, all anyone wanted to \"help\" with was getting the possessions they thought they had rights to. I was so overwhelmed with shock. I'll never forget driving home and finding most of my home being uprooted by her sisters and their families before I even got in the driveway. I dont even know how they got inside. I guess her key. These people had known me since I was a baby. My mom was their little sister. Was I nothing but a yard sale to them? Was I selfish for wanting help?\n\nThere were tons of days that followed where I couldn't function like a regular human. If my partner hadnt been there, I truly dont think I'd be alive; simply because I would literally just have never left my bed and died of starvation or dehydration or something. But I'm here. The crazy thing is, it's still not over. I lost their house/my childhood home, all of the vehicles, and was forced to sell most of their possessions. I had to cover medical bills all the way back from my dad's HEART ATTACK. Im still confused about things having to do with their income taxes and the bankruptcy, even almost 3 years later. I was also so depressed all I could do was wake up, take care of 1 thing pertaining to my parents or my own \"adult\" responsibilities, and then go right back to the  bed and cry. I didnt have a job for over a year. Things got so bad that I had no other choice than to try to find SOMETHING. My partner was working 40 hour weeks and I felt like shit for just lying in bed crying all day every day. He never once got upset with me, told me to get a job, nothing. He always just made sure I was ok. We were teetering on the line of being ok, but I ran out of the very small amount of money my mother had, and I knew I needed to start trying to replace it because I'd just been spending on my rent and bills so I could keep crying under the covers. Still feel like shit for it, cant believe I did that for a year. Since their deaths, I was having really bad problems leaving the house for long periods of time without starting to panic and needing to go home and I was mortified of getting a job and then not being able to do it...luckily I got a very quiet and solitary accounting job that has made things fairly easy to kind of get myself back into the swing of things...I dont get many hours, but I'm too afraid to get a different job that requires customer service or literally any other type of interaction with another human being...\n\nThe thing is, it's been almost 3 years now and I still feel extremely empty, depressed, and more so than ever...scared. I've always been more anxious than the next guy, but it seems like everything terrifies me to the point of panic. Going outside, talking to other people face to face OR on the phone, sleeping...I've started experiencing hypochondriac-like behavior, constantly thinking I MUST have tumors, cancer, blood clots, or am going to have a stroke or heart attack at any moment...I smoke cigarettes, and it's gotten worse since they've passed. I want to stop, but every time I feel anything, I just smoke one. Stressed, sad, happy, anything. I also only eat takeout because cooking/grocery shopping is literally too much for me to think about. I know that sounds pathetic. And it is. I'm telling you it is. It's so embarrassing and just...sad. I've developed an intense fear of dying, not even dying but what comes after. I'm not very religious, but I was raised Southern Baptist (I know right. I basically grew up in the Footloose town.) but I enjoy reading and listening to multiple different religious/spiritual viewpoints and advice so long as they all come from a positive space/don't advocate hurting others. I also enjoy scientific viewpoints and facts about our world and who we are as electric water sacks. But still, I cant shake this literal FEAR about just how \"unknown\" it all is. Everything. And it always sends me into a depressive spiral of \"what's the point, why am I here, why's anyone or anything here, is it even really here at all\"...\n\nI dont have anyone else in my life other than my partner and my rescue dog. I love them so much, but because I love them, I dont want to have to put all of my burdens on their shoulders alone... I desperately want therapy but can barely pay my rent. I find myself just wishing I could call my Mom every time it gets hard. I know it wont ever go away, but heres my actual question to you, Reddit...\n\nHow do I live WITH this loss and this sadness? I know it wont ever go away, but is grief supposed to be forever? I keep kicking myself for \"still not being over it\"...but there's no one in my life who understands this feeling, and to be honest I'm happy because it sucks. How old were you when you lost your parents? What was it like going through the legal process? Did you have family to help you through it all? Are you still mourning? Is mourning supposed to stop after a certain point? Do you blame yourself for lots of things having to do with their passing? How much of this am I \"allowed\" to say is the cause of my crazy mood swings, insomnia, body aches and dissociation...? Will I ever be able to look at my own handwriting again without swelling up with pain about how it looks exactly like hers? Will I ever be able to look her sisters in the face, or will I always feel like I'm looking at a ghost? Is it wrong of me to never want to go back to my hometown ever again, and to wish I could just forget everything and start over as a 26 year old with amnesia and the world at their feet? Please share experiences, advice, or whatever reddit is for.\n\nThank you for reading; this is my first reddit thread-thingy so I'm sorry if I was too much off the bat. Any and all responses are appreciated.\n\n**Also, would it be ok for me to essentially post this same exact post (maybe tweaked a bit) on the \"off my chest\" subreddit? Still VERY new here and dont want to break rules or anything. Thank you.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

They found tumors in his abdomen and lungs. As the next few days unfolded we learned that he had a rare and aggressive form of testicular cancer, it was in his abdominal lymph nodes, lungs, liver and later we find out they missed it in his spine.\n\n\nHe goes through chemo in the ICU, coughing up blood and going downhill everyday. Finally he pulled through. He went through 3 more rounds of chemo getting stronger throughout treatment. \n\n\nNext step is surgery to get his abdominal lymph nodes removed. Before that could happen, they cancel the surgery 5 days before because his bloodwork showed growing disease, 2 days later he has a seizure, I think I\u2019m watching him die. The cancer went to his brain, they also find it in his spine and realized it\u2019s been there since the beginning.\n\n\nHe gets radiation and we move several hours away from home to get him high dose chemo with stem cell rescue at a major cancer center. We had to cancel our wedding 3 weeks out. We left our self employed business and home for over three months. \n\n\nNext step is surgery for his abdominal lymph nodes, But then they tell us something grew larger in his lung. So first they take a wedge of his lung out. Pathology on tumor was all dead tissue (good!).\n\n\nLast Friday he finally had his abdominal surgery. We are in the hospital now as he recovers. They told us today he lost almost 2 liters of blood during surgery because of a tumor being stuck to an artery. He had the best surgeon in the world for this surgery. They also took one of his testicals,  Hes uncomfortably to say the least and today had been \u201ca day\u201d.\n\n\nI\u2019m struggling with my anxiety on getting the pathology for his last surgery.

I thought I had actually come to terms with his death because he showed up as I was walking through the graveyard he was in and I kept telling him he was dead and he left me alone to grieve. \n\nThe other day I was taking a shower and opened the blinds in the bathroom. The sun shone through in what must have been the same hue as the day he died because all of a sudden my brained flashed to the conversation I had with my uncle on the phone telling me my cousin died and the emotion I felt when I had finally gotten to my moms to tell her Rodney died. \n\nI dropped to the floor and lost it. \n\nIt was like all the bones had been pulled from my body and I had lost the ability to stand or breathe. \n\nI hate that I can remember that day as if I am  currently in it. \n\nTonight, I woke up around 3:30am because my husband had gotten out of bed and my brain was starting to process the dream I just had. I thought I\u2019d be able to just go back to sleep and hope to continue this dream but I just started to cry so I got out of bed and came down straits to write this. \n\nIn the beginning of this dream I dreamt that these people, some I knew and some I didn\u2019t, were putting on a show of sorts in remembrance of my cousin. I was singing a song, and then all of a sudden I was driving down a road that was going to some sort of school. When I got there this lady asked me to decorate for another remembrance and as I was doing that my cousin walked in. \n\nIt was crazy because all of these people that were there to remember him didn\u2019t recognize him. So I ushered him out into this garage and closed the door away from all of these people. He leaned against a car, and asked me why all these people were here and I told him that every month we gathered to remember his life because he died. \n\nI told him that his parents buried him in a catholic cemetery (he was an atheist), that his brothers ransacked his bedroom and were wearing his clothes and taking his stuff the day he died, that I cut ties with that side of the family,  and how much he made everyone hurt from killing himself. \n\nThen he said, \u201cIt was all a mistake but I didn\u2019t really die.\u201d\n\nSo I hugged him and started discussing everything we had to do to legally bring him back from the dead. \n\nThen I woke up. \n\nIt took me a few minutes to process but when I did I couldn\u2019t and still can\u2019t stop crying. \n\nSo I guess I should be grateful that he visits me in my dreams.

I watched his slow decline, and mentally prepared myself for his death. I got the call that I was being offered a position to my new job when my dad was still alive. I asked for the rest of the month before starting the position, and my new boss was understanding. So, I got to be there when my dad passed. I was in the room with him, but didn't notice he had passed away until who knows how much later. It was the middle of the night, and my mom, husband, and I were up talking next to the bed where dad slept. He was almost always sleeping by that point, and there was no \"death rattle\" or anything (he was doing home hospice, so he was at home). In fact, my husband was the one who pointed to him, realizing that he may have passed. It was heartbreaking, but at least I know he was surrounded by people he loved and passed quietly in his sleep.\n\nWe called the coroner and had him buried the very next day at a natural burial site (his wishes). That meant we didn't really have a formal funeral, and everything happened so fast. My brother gave a grave side speech a week later to the handful of family who came, and a week after that I started my new job. I haven't cried but a few quiet tears here and there. I've only really bawled twice, and I don't even remember what triggered it the first time (I'll mention the second time in a minute), but I was at home with my husband.\n\nI'm not really sure what I hope to gain by writing this out. I don't really talk to anyone about my feelings other than my husband. He already deals with my problems as a bipolar person, so I have really tried to minimize my feelings as much as possible so I don't burden him more, even though I know he cares and would gladly listen to me. \n\nMy sister in law has taken over the holiday cooking (which was my father's duty he loved), and everything was just so different over Thanksgiving. I wasn't expecting my reaction, but I had to make an excuse at one point to leave the room for a bit because I bawled over the fact that the mash potatoes (the one thing I was in charge of) weren't coming out right (I wanted them to be like Dad's). For some stupid reason I never got his recipes. He always said \"oh, I just wing it!\" But now I'm kicking myself hard for not trying to get a book together of all the foods he loved to cook. All my childhood favorites are just lost now. I'll never have them again. \n\nAnyway, I'm writing this teary-eyed at work, realizing that I've lost my father at 32. I will experience more of my life without him, than I have with him. 20 years from now I will no longer expect to see him when I visit home. I'll no longer remember him the same way. He'll be a distant memory, like my grandmother is (she lived with us until passing when I was about 12) and that breaks my heart. \n\nIt's also weird, because any accomplishments I have in life, I know he won't be there to be proud of me. It's funny how as adults many of us still strive hard to make our parents proud. I'm not religious, so I don't believe he's \"watching over me\" or anything like that. He was very religious, and he wrote me a letter before he died. A lot of the letter was all about my relationship with God (he still thought I was religious), and how I will grow and conquer my own problems as long as I trust in God. Also, he can't wait to see me again in Heaven. In short, that letter broke my heart too. I was hoping for something a little different I suppose.\n\nAnyway, thanks for anyone who reads this.

As adrenaline crawls up my throat and settles on my head, skin, soul, I battle my instinct to run. Quelling my heaving chest, I am thinking about the mortician's choice of the blue and pink quilts that cover the tables, and the soft pink shroud that covers my brother's body. A soft light falls and centers on his form. There is probably research done as to what puts most families at ease, right? Pink is neither effeminate or masculine, but none of the colors seem dignified. Should it be grey? White? I'm confused at the unrealized expectations that have come to clash with this reality before me. Abruptly I realize that my thoughts are absurd, and work on putting one foot in front of the other once I notice that my sister is reaching for my hand. Without bitterness I tried to remember when the last time that had happened. It's a special occasion, I file this observation away. All the while in the back of my mind I am reminding myself that I am having and noticing these thoughts because of the hormones flooding my system, pull yourself into the present and breathe, please. You know how brains work, tread around these instincts. \n\nAnd they have done such a good job, though all we are allowed to see is his face because of the autopsy (seizure related, nothing definitive). One of us comments that it looks like he will wake up and joke that he was playing a prank. His nose is so cute, it's my fathers 30 years ago. I wish I could see his blue-yellow eyes, and morbidly understand there's probably nothing there. I scrutinize his eyelids to see if it looks unnatural. Maybe I'm expecting to see spikes under his skin. They look normal. Buddy is lifted to sniff his best friend, sniffs once, again, puts his paw out and turns his head resolutely away. My dad comments that we aren't supposed to touch him, \"because he'd probably fall apart\". Eesh. Don't think too hard on that. It had been a couple of weeks as my sister had needed permission to fly from her doctor, but we'd declined embalming. We chuff a laugh, and each of us lay the back of our hands on his cheek as a final closure. And that's what dead feels like. Unnatural. Not ice cold. Just not warm. Unlife. He's gone. Closure. Last hope is cleanly put away. \n\nThis memory is neither bitter, nor painful...time has taken away the emotion specific to it, but the time of year has given everything that overlay that runs from your throat to the center of your abdomen. If I'm not busy lately, I come back to it, most likely needing the review to sort out the pieces in my subconscious so that I can put it to rest. Maybe writing this out will let it go, so that I can remember him with love instead of grief! I already feel better.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

There are no hormones to control like other breast cancers so it\u2019s hard to monitor / treat. After her chemotherapy, we found she has thyroid cancer.

It also hurt that she would never meet my kids. \n\nAfter this, I stayed with my mom at her house and worked from home. She deteriorated so.fast. She could barely walk, had no appetite, couldn\u2019t think straight. It was so weird because I had never seen my mom like that. During an Oncologist appt we let him know about the symptoms, he was very concerned and ordered a head CT immediately. After taking her to the appointment, i went home for the evening to attend my office Christmas party, i figured doing something normal would be nice and my mom really wanted me to go. \n\nAs soon as I got home, I got a call saying my mom had a seizure at home. It was brought on by the CT scan and fluid you\u2019re given prior. From here, we learned my mother had brain tumors which were causing all of her symptoms. I was devastated yet relieved that the doctors had a plan of attack and to do radiation. We were hoping with the treatments the tumors would shrink and she could be somewhat functioning for us to make memories together with the time we had left. \n\nAfter her first radiologist appt, we found out there were 10 tumors around her brain. She was in constant pain and the radiation treatments knocked her out. The doctors told us she may not wake up from the state she was in. In the same day, she woke up and was very responsive, we were all so relieved. I got to spend some really good time with her and I was feeling so hopeful. That night, she went back to being in an unresponsive sleep state, but we figured she just needed the rest since she had been up for so long. \n\nI came back the next morning with my sister and Aunt. My moms radiation treatment was cancelled as she was too unresponsive. The radiologist said she may only have a few days left. \n\nWhile sitting with her, sobbing, she began to make a choking sound. She had been throwing up the night before so I figured it was just that. I couldn\u2019t stand the sound so I left while the doctor and nurse came in. I called my dad and told him to come see my mom since she didn\u2019t have many days left. \n\nWhile walking back to the room, the doctor told me she was passing. Could be hours, could be minutes. When I got back to her room, her lips were already blue. She took a few last breathes and that was it. She was gone. \n\nThis all happened within 1 month. I accepted 2-3 years with the understanding we could make the most of it. She left so suddenly and I have a hole in my heart. I\u2019m riding this weird high of \u201cokayness\u201d while making arrangements and keeping my family together but really fear the future of when this is all over. \n\nI know i will have a piece of exciting news and she will be the first person i want to call. \n\nI can\u2019t believe she\u2019s gone.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I'm now 25 and married, and living on my own, but I feel an immense weight to fill the role of 2 sons...", "author": "krustykrags", "self_text": "Apologies for being long-winded, just don't know how to find my words about this...\n\nMy grief was shock, and then a bout of being distraught. I've since come to terms with life and the fragility of it and while I still grieve my brother's death, I continue to move forward in life. My dad I think still hurts, but I believe he's moved forward mostly. However, my mom still has trouble, especially now around the holidays. It's all made worse by the fact that I got married this year and spend most of my time with my wife or friends. Basically, I don't know how to communicate to my parents, or at least my mom, that I want to live my life just as any son would after he's moved out and gotten married. Instead, I still feel this weight from an unspoken obligation that I have to be around a lot or go out of my way to do things just so that I can fill not only my own role, but the void left behind by my brother. It was hard enough to get them to be okay mentally with me moving out after I came home from college and lived at home for over a year. \n\nAn example: with Christmas coming up, my wife's parents (who I'll preface with saying are great friends with my parents, we all live in the same place) decided that they're going to California for a week over Christmas. They've always been somewhat of a go with the flow family for some holidays, especially because they too have some emotional attachment (my wife's mother's mother passed away close to Christmas years ago, and it was a very important holiday to her). The conversation came up between my mom and I that my wife and I had considered going to California for at least some time to spend some of Christmas with her family. We're not going, and instead we're staying here with my family, but immediately when I brought it up, my mom was almost moved to tears. Granted, this is the first Christmas for them that I won't be at home the night before, or wake up there the day of, etc. And Christmas has always been a big holiday for our family. But still... It makes me super, super anxious thinking about how one year, we might go to spend time with her family if they decide to go out of town again since this year she won't get to see them on Christmas. Or maybe one year, we take a trip just the two of us. Like I feel like I just need to say it to them now, so they can mentally get ready for one year where they might not see us on the exact day of the holiday... We'd still celebrate, it just might be on a different day. But even that could crush my mom I feel like. Or my grandmother.\n\nMaybe it's just a process and each year will get better... eventually we'll have kids and they'll be the focus of the holidays anyway. But it just extends past holidays... It's like if I don't call them or my grandmother, or go see them, or whatever it is, for an extended amount of time, I feel twice the guilt. I try to tell them to invite me, or be the one to call me when they want to talk or hang out or whatever, but it still always seems to fall on me. And I try so hard to not be passive aggressive about. I often get the \"hey haven't heard from you in a while\" when I call or something, and I just want to say \"yeah I haven't heard from you either\" but I know that just makes them feel bad which in turn makes me feel worse. \n\nI just want a normal relationship with my family. It's not abnormal, but it's just so much different. Has anyone else been the younger sibling in a family where the older sibling passed away? How do you deal with that? What do you communicate? Did your parent grieve more through celebration of life and less through sadness?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

It\u2019s not as special anymore. A new Star Wars something comes out every day it seems. You don\u2019t have to search too hard to find cool merch. It\u2019s just always there in your face.

Like most people, my dad exposed me to Star Wars when I was a kid and was so excited when Episode 1 was coming out. He downloaded the trailer and we watched it a million times. He bought me the books and I already knew what was going to happen going in.\n\u2022\nHe took me out of school early to see Episode 2 (I was in 8th grade).\n\u2022\nHe sat in line with me all evening to take me to the midnight showing of Episode 3 (I was a junior in high school). He then we out during the middle of the day the next day to get me and my friends tickets so we could see it together after school. He always told me about how he walked past all the people waiting in line who hadn\u2019t seen it yet and teased them with \u201cohhh it\u2019s great!!!\u201d\n\u2022\nFor Episode 7 he sat in line with a friend of mine, who he didn\u2019t know, ALL DAY so we could get the seats we wanted.\n\u2022\nSo yea, I don\u2019t feel like watching them anymore.

Everyone should have such a childhood as they gave me. Many hugs and kisses, stories before bedtime, trips to see the country and amusement parks. A human could not ask for more attention and love. I knew I was spoiled because people told me so, I was difficult for teachers and had trouble in middle school. Parents paid for me to attend a catholic school even though we weren't catholic, hoping I would fit in better and get a better education. $220 a month was no small amount of money to a coal miner from Kentucky in the 90s.

Bought me a beautiful unique truck for my 16th birthday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took these gifts and my father for granted. Worse I took advantage. Around age 20 I was still working bullshit jobs and living with a girlfriend in a house we rented from her parents. I loved her and I also loved my bestfriend, I formed a second family which was beautiful, until my best friend died. I spiraled out on drugs and ended up in a mental health facility. My parents, of course, came everyday they could and brought me back home still a paranoid wreck. I was under the delusion my friends wealthy parents blamed me for his death and were out to destroy me. I slept at the foot of their bed when I was so terrified I couldn't sleep alone. I was never the same after that, and a year later my girlfriend left me for someone more deserving. Since then I've lived with my parents most of the time. They provided another vehicle for me after the first one they gave me died. I've failed to stick with every job I've had and not always because of the disorder the shrinks say I have.  I'm lazy self centered and now when the man that gave me everything and protected and provided for me is gone, im still just talking about myself. He deserved a better son, and a much better retirement than having to stay around here because I couldn't be counted on to support myself.

He was abused, and he would run away from anyone who tried to pet him for the first month that we had him. They found him abandoned on the side of a road after a terrible tornado destroyed the animal shelter in Joplin, Missouri. Our goal was to make him as happy as possible and give him a second chance at life, and thats exactly what we did. After a couple months, he began to grow closer to us. He no longer ran away from us trying to pet him, he ate his food regularly, and he became very good friends to our other havanese that we had. I could truly tell that, for once in his life, he had trusted somebody. Over those years we made many good memories: taking him for long walks around our golfcourse, trying to get him to learn how to swim, and going on car rides. These were the times that I knew he had been missing out on. Even after the death of our other dog, I could tell that he was happy to have a family that cared for him. Despite him beginning to get old, I thought we could spend a few more years together before saying goodbye. \n\nHowever, all of that abruptly changed, just a few days ago. We were out of town at the time, and I woke up at around 6:30 in the morning, hearing my mom talking with my grandmother on the phone. I just heard my parents questioning what was going on, and I could easily infer what had happened. My dog had been unexpectedly ran over and killed at just 12 years old; the same dog that I had made so many memories with over the years.

Backstory: my dad died about 2 and a half months ago. It was sudden and unexpected. My dad was a very active man. He was 63 but had the energy of a 18 year old. He never got sick. The day he died, my mom and I dropped off my brother and dad to a Texans football game. He was so excited because he is such a big fan and it was his first game. About 10 minutes after leaving, my brother called my mom saying that my dad didn\u2019t feel good. Long story short, my dad had a heart attack. We were all in shock. Anyway, his death impacted my family so much and it always will. My dad was the breadwinner in the family. Had a great paying job, healthcare, company truck and phone. My dad was the best. He was loving, smart, funny, kind. The best dad in the world. He was supportive. My mom has suffered a lot. He died on her birthday. They were married for 33 years. She is having a really hard time. We have a very long road ahead of us. My grandma is devastated as this is her 2nd son she has lost. My brother being the oldest of all his siblings. \n\nAnyway, the thought I had from the moment he died, his body will decay. I can\u2019t help but think what is going to happen to his body. When I arrived at the funeral home for the viewing, I broke down because I had to see his cold body. I couldn\u2019t bear seeing my dad\u2019s body cold where it was once warm. Feeling no pulse and his body cold just got to me. He was bloated and not like himself. After he was buried, maybe 2 weeks after, all I could think was what does he look like now? The thought of his body falling apart and decaying makes me sad. I know it\u2019s part of life and nature but it makes me sad. The person who once was smiling and laughing is now underground, decaying. I think that\u2019s one thing that keeps disturbing me. He\u2019s supposed to be with his family and enjoying the holidays. My birthday is next week, the day after Christmas. Today that I am posting this, makes one year that my first dog, Miranda, died. I know that my dad and dog are together now. He loved her so much. Now they are happy and together again. \nAnyway that\u2019s my thought. I don\u2019t know if anyone has that thought as well. I remember when watching Game of Thrones, when Cersei sees Myrcella\u2019s body, she talks about when the first time she saw a dead body, her mother. And then she asks herself, \u201cwhat does she look like now? Has she turned black?\u201d \nI hope all is well with everyone and the holidays are hard but it\u2019s possible to get through them.

He passed away October 22nd... Which is our older brother's birthday...Thanksgiving marked the first month, Christmas eve marks the second month... He was only 22 years old. I helped plan his viewing from a state away. I helped, by my mother's request, to write the message on the memorial cards, and to speak a poem as one of the last words. I've broken down so many times on the few chances I've had alone.\n\nMy little brother was always the life of the party, happy around people and loved to be the \"Best Uncle\" to any kid that needed someone to play with them, teach them, or anyone who needed a friend. Hell, he even talked a few of his friends down from being suicidal. He was, overall, a great man. \n\nI've been avoiding the subject of him. My throat gets tight, the tears come near instantly, and my words just won't come out. I live a state away from my family, with my own little family. I act as a caregiver for my husband's grandmother. It's hard showing any emotions around her bc she judges you on doing so. I was also taught as a kid to cry silently, where you can't be seen. \n\nWhat I'm getting at is that I have been avoiding every aspect of allowing myself to grieve my brother's death. Until today. Today I went looking through his facebook page. Last night I freaked out a bit because his messanger messages have his voice clips to me and I couldn't find the messages last night. I went through to his page to get to our messages, to hear his voice again... And on his page are so many videos his friends have posted of him and him smiling, happy, loved. \n\nHe wasn't at Thanksgiving this year... He didn't steal the hole tray of baked mac n cheese, like he does every year. He won't be here for Christmas to play with the kids and help them open their gifts (He would sit his 6ft 2in self on the floor and have our nephew on one side and my daughter on the other helping them pull off tape and paper). \n\nMy daughter will be three in only a few weeks. We took her to the viewing. I know it may seem like she is young, and she is too young to grasp death, but she did know who her uncle was. She looked at me and said, \"Mommy he sleepin'\". I said yes baby he is sleeping. My best friend came, amd his daughter (same age as my own, also has a tendancy of calling me mommy and her own mom mama lol) said the same thing. It broke me. \n\nToday I broke at a post our mom wrote on his page. I tried to pretend to be okay and move past it. I can't. I broke again. I'm bawling my eyes out as I write this. To know he will never be at another bbq, he would come into my home unannounced, blaring music, his work boots won't ever be sat by my front door again, he won't be there anymore, to make anymore memories.... \n\nThis is the first time I've posted so much about him, and about how I feel about his loss in a while. Without him here, Christmas just doesn't feel like Christmas this year...", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I was ignorant. I looked upon the posts and as the days passed Christmas seemed easy as pie. You see your loved ones, you are in that buzz, you cook and see people. \nI was wrong.\nIt was the funeral/memorial buzz I was referring to in my mind I guess. Those first 10 days I was handling it. People around, it was still fresh but it was soothing. \nWe went shopping for lil bit this and that yesterday. We were close to the mall at my parents so ofc we would visit. My mom always waited for that. I was going around looking at things. Looking for that ornament I always put on the tree to kind of represent what the year was about. \nIt was hard to find an angel. One that would be proper for her. It was all suddenly hard. Christmas had been always kinda hard. When I had work I would go hunting to buy everyone that little small gift they'd like, as much as we could afford. Usually never getting me something. \nMy mom would scold me. She would slip a bill and tell me to buy me something nice, or as usual. Buy me something herself that I would whine about (because ya know it wasn't this I wanted) but then I would soon adore it and she would be again in the right. She would always lift the guilt to get something for me, like spending 30 on a perfume that I would turn down. \nI didn't get anything. \nI went home. \nIt was empty. \nShe wasn't there on the couch greeting us. \nI went into the bedroom and looked for her pendant I couldn't find. I asked her in a dream where it was and she replied to me it was on the bed side table. Before I could realise we could talk I woke up.\nI had looked in the drawers and had found nothing. I looked again. Nothing. I was starting to think it was just my mind with my stupid dreams. There it was, a bag she had, that someone moved from another room on the table. Some notes, recipes she wrote in the back of receipts. Her glasses, more glasses. I took out her sunglasses and something made noise in the fabric case. Her pendant and earrings. \nIt started raining and the house was cold. She would have put on a shawl and ask my dad to turn the ac on. I looked around for some of her clothes, shoving my face in her wardrobe it smelled like her. \nI took some things, a shirt I would give my mother in law as they wore similar styles. My acoustic she bought me for my birthday that I begged for but never took classes of learned to play. Some of her jewelry. The bracelet I gifted her that said \"mama\".\nShe would scold my dad and taken care of him not changing clothes, the sadness hit me. \nWe drove home and I was holding the pendant in my hands. It wasn't the one I always remember her with. A heavy chain and pendant of Mary. This was lighter. I couldn't remember. Did she melt her gold..and got something lighter to get some money. Was it a gift and her pendant is somewhere else. I can't ask. \nI came home and shoved my face into the blanket that smelled like home. I muffled cried, asking why. Why did she had to die. At the hospital she was telling me \"I feel sorry for you\". In a pity way because I was there in the hospital, trying to get a bit of sleep on the chair. I told her I didn't mind. I didn't sleep much at night. She shouldn't have. Well if she felt sorry for me, why she went and died. Why she didn't try harder to overcome it.\nComing to this post. I unpacked the stuff I got yesterday. And I broke down. One of her winter jackets, as I reached the pocket had some tissues and a couple of notes. Her handwriting. Some weird language to spell mine, hers and my dad's name. A card from a retirement lawyer. The one she never got even if she was too sick to work and was declared \"able to if she can walk\". \nI can't fucking handle Christmas as I smartass thought. It's been over a month I spoke to her. That last half and hour I saw her in the ICU when she was still not intubated. When I left after talking with the doctors she was asleep and I just lightly touched her and she was startled but I just waved bye. She was tired, I know, she was emotionally and physically exhausted. The bank, the house, the bills, Christmas, the work and the retirement she couldn't get. But God damnit it we all are. What's gonna be on Christmas. Exactly a month since she was still here. The call at 7.51 saying she had a heart stroke. Them trying to resuscitate. Failing. Me missing the call. Calling back. Them telling she didn't make it. Try harder idfk. That fucking Thursday. The 21st. When I saw her intubated. Alone. Standing in a corner of that ICU while nurses were just busy around when I was weeping because there was my mom I saw yesterday with tubes in her all around. A breathing machine. The echo of the beep I still hear when I'm in a silent room. I was afraid. I didn't know if I touched it. Would it help. Would she know I was there, would I mess something up, a reading. The same visit that evening. Alone. When it was raining so badly and I was soaked. When they gave me her stuff in a giant bag because she was transferred to the ICU downstairs and didn't need it. Her waking up for a while and me panicking. She tried to get the tube out, talk, idk anymore I was just telling her it was fine, that the tube was to help her breathe. That she had to try. That she had to try harder. Then the anesthesia hit and that was all. The last time I saw her respond. \nI'm sitting in her jacket and crying. Idk even why I'm bothering people online with this random text of shit but it all hurts. Christmas hurts. It hurts and I just wished she tried harder. I literally fucking begged to take some of my time and give it to her. For me. I could fucking spare couple years from my life for her just to have some more. She felt sorry for me and she went and died. Rude. Mom. Very rude. \nI'm sorry. I'm sorry for this text but I don't even know. I don't know.

I am worried that whatever he put on it (other than Hubby's name) will upset my kids. I don't want to see them as we don't have a good relationship for the most part. We are civil, but we don't really like each other. Mostly we have nothing in common. And I stand up to FIL when he is awful. FIL was upset with us when my husband died. Rather than having a priest there to pray over him, my sons read a book to him, one from a series he read out loud to them at bedtime when they were little. It was such a loving thing to do, but it apparently was strange according to my FIL. I let him (FIL) have a Catholic Funeral Mass, what more did he want? (Hubby was Catholic, and I am vehemently not).\n\nI don't want to meet them at his grave. I don't really want to see them at all. I am doing this out of respect to my husband and for my kids. But I dread it. I would rather go out there alone or just with my kids. They would prefer that too. At least it is quite cold here so we won't stand out there for long. \n\nI hate cancer. Hubby died less than 3 months after we found that he had it. Closer to 2 months from diagnosis to death. It was awful. I find it sad that Hubby wanted my mom at his appointments more than his dad or stepmom. He absolutely refused to let me tell his mother anything. He didn't want her there at all, not even when he was healthy. Seeing her today will be awful. She refused to even speak to me at the funeral. \n\nMy thoughts are such a jumble, as you can tell from reading this. Thank you if you read it all.

We were not very close for the last 5 years or so. I have a lot of fond memories of childhood stuff, of course, but we just grew apart the older I got. Moreso, I've been incredibly sad on behalf of my father who I AM very close with. He was also very close with his dad and his primary caretaker for the last year or so.\n\nMy dad has just had a rough year since - he is currently on day 72 of a long-overdue strike at his work. This will be his first Christmas, followed quickly by his first birthday, without his dad. My dad isn't a macho man who never shows emotions or anything, but sadness and tears specifically wasn't something I saw a lot growing up. I've seen him cry more in the last few months than I have in my previous 19 years of existing.\n\nIt's too late to be a Christmas gift, but I'd like to get a memorial/rememberance gift for him as maybe a late birthday gift (his birthday is the first week of January.

I moved out this year but I've tried my best to spend time with him as much as I can, give him hugs, etc. It's especially difficult as I'm autistic and shared empathy is practically impossible for me when I haven't experience something exact, and this is the first family member I have ever lost. I am sad he feels so sad but often I feel bad, almost guilty, for just.. not being very sad anymore about my grandpa passing (obviously I have NEVER voiced this to my father - he knew I didn't have a super close relationship with and personally disliked my grandpa but I have only vented about this to other people in secrecy).\n\nSorry for the longish post!

Firstly because this is a very long one and secondly, English isn't my first language so I hope I express everything correctly and it won't be confusing. I tried to keep is as short as I could, but it's still a long ass read :P. So to everyone who takes the time to read this: Thank you so much, you're the best!! \n\nMy beloved grandma passed away last week and it's been really hard on me. This is the first time in my live that someone so close to me passed away which is difficult by itself, but after her death a few things were revealed which has made it even more difficult for me to deal with. That's why I'm in desperate need of some advice... I'm usually a pretty decisive person but I've never felt so torn/confused about how to feel and it makes me feel very alone and very lost.  \n\nA little backstory. I've always known my grandma wasn't the nicest nor easiest to get along with. She's been nothing but amazing to me and her other grandkids, but she definitely wasn't the best mother for my mom and her two older brothers. After my parents divorced when I was six (I'm 25 now) my mom got in a big fight with her two brothers which led them to break off contact. Partly because she cheated on my dad and left him penniless with two little girls (my sister was 4 and I was 6) to care for on his own, only to marry an absolute asshole within two months after the divorce was finalised but also because divorce was very uncommon off back then. Especially in the small Christian village I'm from, it was an absolute scandal. Because of this, my moms brothers didn't speak to her for the next 18 years and also broke off contact with each other later on because of another fight. During those 18 years my grandpa passed away because of cancer, which left my grandma heartbroken after losing her first and only love. Another thing to note is that the middle child - let's call him Q - always was my grandma's favourite which she's never made a secret. And she's also always had a difficult relationship with the eldest son, S. \n\nFast forward to two years ago. When my mother was diagnosed with kidney cancer, she and her brothers finally made amends after 18 years without contact. This wasn't easy, but they tried their best to make things work and be civil. When my mom was cured they kept the peace for my grandma, who had been suffering from a rare chronic illness for years which kept getting worse until she was eventually admitted to a hospice, this was three weeks ago. During her stay there, she was really calm and peaceful. She was tired and didn't want to go on anymore, she wanted to be with her husband again. While she was in the hospice she was sweet and soft which she hadn't been - especially to my uncle S - in years, which made S very emotional, she finally gave him the motherly love he had been craving for for years. When she eventually passed away last Tuesday morning we all felt very much at peace, despite our grief. But unfortunately this peace didn't last long. The next day my mother and her brothers went through a folder with my grandma's last wished and in this folder were three letters, one for each of her children. The letters for my mom and Q were very sweet, but S's one was absolutely horrible. I don't know what the letter said, but from what I've heard S said: \"I might be cold, but she surpassed even me\". And this destroyed everything. My grandma wrote these letters in 2015, but she was 100% aware of their existence until very recently. My mom and her went through the folder many times even as recent as 4 weeks before her passing and my mom even held the envelopes, so it's not like they were forgotten or were hidden away. I've tried to explain this to everyone I tried talking to about this and they all keep saying the same things: 'Maybe she didn't mean to keep them in there' or 'she wrote them 4 years ago, she must have forgotten'. But despite my love for her, I know my grandma and I know our family. I know she wrote them deliberately and I know she kept those letters in that folder deliberately. My grandma was ill, but she wasn't stupid nor was she demented or forgetful. Her mind was sharp until the very end. We knew she wasn't a particularly warm or nice person, we knew she could be manipulative and demanding and at times even vindictive. But we never knew she could be this evil. What kind of mother would do this to her own children?! She tried to pitch her children against each other, even in death, and she absolutely destroyed her eldest son with the most horrible words she won't ever be able to take back. Her death brought nothing but pain and destruction.  And now we're left with so many questions that will never be answered. \n\nAnd what's made this all so very difficult for me is that - despite her faults - she was the best grandmother. I've always had a special relationship with her. She never admitted to it but according to my mom I was her absolute favourite. I wasn't her first grandchild, but I was her daughters first child which apparently was very special to her. She and my granddad adored me and picked me up every Friday, even though they lived hours away. I spent more time with them then any of the other grandkids and when I got older we remained very close. She was always there. When my mom abandoned us for her idiot second husband that eventually left her penniless, through the many shitty boyfriends she had after and also when my dads girlfriend - who hates me for no reason - kicked me out at 17 with no where to go whilst my dad stood by and did nothing. She never judged me when I got an abortion at 21, she was there when I felt depressed and lonely because of it and I couldn't tell my dad because he always said abortion was murder, even though he knew about it through his girlfriends daughter to whom I told it this in confidence because I thought she was my friend. And he just kept his mouth shut and watched, while I went through the darkest years of my life. My grandma was there for me always. But it feels like it's all ruined now, because what she did is unforgivable and I feel so lost because of it. I want to text her or call her and ask her why she did what she did. And I worry that she won't go to heaven now or won't be able to fine peace. The image of her alone and desperate, still on earth, without anyone who can hear her, without a chance to ever make it right. I want to forgive her, even though I'm not the person to do so. I want her to be happy and to be with grandpa again. I love her so much and I miss her, but a mother shouldn't hurt her own children the way she did. Because the letter was just the tip of the iceberg. And because of this I question everything. What does it say about me that I apparently was the favourite of such a person? Are people just evil in nature? Is nothing really what it seems? I try to put on a happy face, I try to be strong and keep myself busy with work and friends. But when I'm alone my mind runs wild and I've never felt so confused, torn, disappointed. How can someone who has always been so loving and kind to me, be so evil at the same time? I can't sleep, I can't concentrate. I've spent hours looking online for quotes and stories of people who've gone through something similar. Something to make me understand, something that will bring me peace or something that makes feel understood, even a little bit. But there's nothing. That's why I'm writing this here now, because I really don't know what to do anymore...\n\nIf you made it through my very, very longwinded post I'd like to thank you. I don't mean to sound desperate, but thank you for taking time out of your day to read this. Any advice is welcome and appreciated, it really means a lot :).", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Everyone\u2019s first reaction when I say that is \u201cwell, it\u2019s not like you lost a parent\u201d - a sentiment which some even express aloud. My grief is automatically dismissed and considered overdramatic.\n\nBut my grandpa raised me. I used dad and grandpa interchangeably. My mom was a single mom working from home as a non-litigation attorney. She was a workaholic, and if I bothered her between the hours of 5am and 6-8pm, I would be in big trouble. So my grandpa stepped up. He was my whole world. And, in my teen years, when he was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s, I was right there with him, taking him to his appointments, and eventually helping him eat, use the restroom, and get from his chair to his wheelchair. I turned down my dream college to stay close to home, and eventually things got bad enough for me to move back home and care for him (at which point I started community college).\n\nIn preschool, I started having bad anxiety and had panic attacks almost every day during nap time. My whole family is incredibly neurotypical, so nobody knew quite how to handle it. But my grandpa started picking me up during nap time and taking me to the aquarium to look at the fish, and things were ok for a while. He was the only one who ever made my words feel like they had value, and like I was heard when I spoke. Even when he was bad, he still listened. He was my number one supporter and my best friend. When things felt hopeless, he was there to tell me if I was kind and patient, good things would come.\n\nHe passed earlier this year and I miss him with all my heart. I know he was unhappy and he was ready, but I want him back. I feel so selfish because all I can think about is how alone in the world I am without him. I don\u2019t have anyone who quite understands or takes my loss seriously - even my mom told me that I\u2019m \u201cnot grieving enough.\u201d I\u2019m a very introverted person, and my grief comes in the form of shutting myself away and not speaking. My mom is very extroverted and had never struggled with anxiety or depression, so we\u2019re quite different.\n\nI\u2019ve finally found a therapist to start dealing with my grief. I just need someone to validate my feelings. Logically, I know what I\u2019m feeling is normal, and that I\u2019m mourning the loss of my dad, but emotionally I just feel like I\u2019m being silly or overdramatic.\n\nThis is my first time losing anyone, and it\u2019s harder than anyone could have prepared me for. I\u2019ve never seen anyone, like, not alive before, I guess, and the image is branded into my mind. I can\u2019t stop seeing it. It\u2019s had me thinking a lot about death and mortality this year. I just wanna go back to when things were better, and grandpa wasn\u2019t sick. I wish I appreciated that time better. Thanks to anyone who read all this, I just really needed to vent a bit. I appreciate you all and hope you\u2019re able to find some peace in the new year. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re here.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

At 20, my mom got sick and died too. I was their only child. I have a fractured family with a lot of estrangement. It was always us three. Now it's just me.\n\nIt's been almost nine years. I'm 27. I hoped and prayed that with time things would start to get better. I would meet someone. I would find purpose. All these horrible roads I've been forced down would lead me *somewhere*. There would be some sort of sense or peace behind why my lot in life was to witness so much suffering between the two people I loved most in the world. Why it was my lot in life to spend these seven years as a shell of my former self. A reason for *why me?* What did I do to deserve this?\n\nAnyone I know in person who has suffered a loss seems to have a decent support group. Two high school friends lost their dads at 16. But they had siblings, and a decade+ later, they still have their moms. I read about people suffering loses but they have partners or children to share their grief with. They have *someone*.\n\nSeven years spent mostly alone. A very small circle of family and friends getting smaller over the years because it's just too much for me to keep the relationships going. I lurk on social media to see kids from my high school graduating class complete college, go to grad school, travel abroad, start their careers. They're not just dating anymore, they're marrying and having kids. My twenties are nearly gone and with every passing day I struggle to want to go on anymore. I can't look at myself in the mirror anymore. I can't converse with strangers because I don't want them to ask me about my personal life. I am ashamed and embarrassed. I feel pathetic. I feel old. I feel fucking cursed. Bitter. Angry. Worn down. If we were to meet, you probably wouldn't know. I smile brightly at cashiers and am friendly with customer service. I'll answer a friend's phone call when she wants to complain about her relationship problems and listen and give advice if they ask for it. But when it's all over and I'm in my room alone, I'm staring at a wall, empty.\n\nI thought maybe my life would come full circle when I would have a family of my own. I would have my own little one and for them I'd start celebrating Christmas again. I'd be able to feel something. I'd want to live again.\n\nBut I can't even imagine dating let alone someone marrying me and having kids. I haven't even been kissed since I was 19 because of the chaos of everything. I can't even imagine being loved anymore. It feels like a foreign concept that once upon a time, I was two people's most important person. That I was loved more than anything or anyone else in the world.\n\nI feel like damaged goods.\n\nNo one mentions my parents much for fear of awkwardness or upsetting me, I guess. For a while, this was how I wanted it. Now I'm desperate for someone to share a memory with me, to tell me they miss them, too. To make it seem like they weren't just characters made up in my head, but they existed.\n\nThen I read or see on the news people in poverty, on the streets, lacking clean drinking water. Babies dying. Families being murdered. Single moms dying of cancer, praying for a miracle so she can have a few more years left with her kids. Toddlers needing heart transplants. My struggles seem like peanuts in comparison. My dad wanted so badly to live for a few more extra years just so he'd know I'd be okay. In letters, he begged God to get well so he could have just a little more time. Here I am, decently healthy, practically praying for my car to be sidelined on the highway and take me out.\n\nI've tried a great deal of things over the years in an attempt to mourn, move on, find happiness.\n\nTherapy / Medication / Yoga / Moving cities / \"Positive vibes\" / Art / Writing / Exercising / Shopping / Reading / Working and much more.\n\nI've kept going because once you hit rock bottom, the only way is suppose to be up. I've tried for my dogs. I have three of them. Every time I've asked myself for reasons why I want to live, they are always my number one. I would \\*never\\* abandon them without knowing they'd be okay and that's what has kept me here and will keep me here. But sometimes I think I could get a good lump of cash together and find someone willing to take them in and take care of them for the rest of their lives. They maybe would miss me, but it'd be temporary. I have a few close friends that would miss me, but again, life would slowly replace any really bad grief. They'll get on with their lives, have careers, marry, take care of their children. Maybe they'd think of me from time to time but they'd be okay.\n\nIdk, I just needed to vent. This holiday season has been the hardest one I've ever gone through.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I was distraught when we realized it was the end. I was miserable when I learned she passed in hospice. But at the wake and funeral I felt...normal (for the most part). I went through them in a haze, but the amount of people (500+) that showed up to the services filled me with a sense of love and pride about my grandma. I cried twice at the funeral and haven\u2019t cried since. \n\n\nShe was my very best friend, and my partner in crime. My brain knows she\u2019s gone, but it almost feels like she\u2019s just a phone call away or in the next room instead of being gone forever. She loved this time of year, and I always have too. We had our first Christmas Eve and Christmas Day without her and while all my relatives were sad and awkward, I enjoyed my holiday. It was quiet without her, but I felt okay. \n\n\nI hate that I feel okay. I don\u2019t know why I am not as distraught as I feel I \u201cshould\u201d be. This has been the most substantial loss I\u2019ve ever had and I am able to laugh and enjoy the holiday season. I feel like I am broken. My heart aches and periods of sadness wash over me, but I don\u2019t know if/when the pain of losing a part of me will come. I don\u2019t know what to do and I am too embarrassed to share this with my family. So now I am posting here, because I don\u2019t know what else to do.

But I feel the need to share this with someone \u2013 even if it's just an anonymous post on Reddit. So here it goes...\r\nMy mom suddenly passed away in September of 2019 at the age of 49. She didn't live to see my 25th birthday, which was less than a month away. She was the only person whom I fully trusted, and I love her as much as children can possibly love their parents - infinitely. I am her only son... \r\nShe was the kindest and most idealistic person I ever knew! She was so pure (and sometimes naive), never harmed anyone, was always eager to help everyone and she often believed people to be better than they are\u2026 She didn\u2019t deserve all this!\n\r\nThat day, we were going to have dinner one minute, and the next, she collapsed. When I saw her just lying on the floor, I felt raw fear. My emotional part kind of shut down and I functioned (barely) on some kind of autopilot. Parts of what happened next are vague and scrambled. She tried to breathe, but couldn\u2019t. I tried to put her on the couch nearby but somehow the shock made me really weak, so I could only do that on my second attempt (even though she was really slim and tender - I was about 45 kg and she was probably even lighter). When paramedics arrived they didn\u2019t even try doing anything \u2013 they took their time making caustic and downright insulting comments about our appartment (it just so happened that there was a minor mess that I hadn\u2019t had time to clean up). I thought they were waiting for a bribe, but I only had my debit card and no cash on me. So I didn\u2019t bring it up. They argued among themselves about whether they should transport her to ER. At some point, they called actual doctors at the hospital and described my mother\u2019s condition. Eventually, they just told me to get our passports. I didn\u2019t even realize at first that the passports weren\u2019t needed for emergency medical help. Then they told me that my mom had passed. All this time, there was so much derision in the paramedics' voices. \r\n\r\nWhen the police arrived, they told some neighbours what had happened and asked them to be witnesses. When these neighbours found out about what had happened they laughed. One of them gleefully told them that I'd killed my mom! After people from the morgue left, I noticed that certain pretty expensive samples were gone. I'm a chemist, and I was supposed to run a chemical analysis on some coins for a friend of mine. Apparently, paramedics stole them when they were \u2018helping me to find my and my mom's passports'. Or it could be the police. I\u2019m not overly concerned with the financial damage, but I can\u2019t stop thinking about how upset my mom would be about this\u2026 What is wrong with people?! Am I in hell?!\n\r\nThe autopsy report says that it was acute coronary heart disease which developed as a result of acute heart deficiency. Of course, one can\u2019t just trust reports in my home country\u2026 She'd had health problems for 10+ years but postponed seeing a doctor. I'm not even sure if those health problems are connected to the cause of death. But they must be... I should have forced her to see a doctor! Instead, I was so afraid to even think about her condition being serious that I pretended that it's not as bad as it looked. Or, maybe, it would've made a difference if I\u2019d just called an ambulance sooner? What if this idiotic medical reform of 2019 had been approved a little later or not at all? Maybe, if my mom hadn\u2019t been so depressed she wouldn\u2019t have postponed seeing a doctor? There are so many whatif's swarming in my head! It seems that, if something in this chain of events (at least some minor stuff) had gone differently, my mom would've stayed alive!\r\nI couldn\u2019t even bury her body near her uncle's grave as she wanted due to beaurocracy - even though we had the necessary documents.\n\r\nAnd now, I can\u2019t help thinking how she suffered in life: she was born with a heart condition (which, it appears, she didn't even know about until my birth), my maternal grandmother was pretty abusive, her father basically abandoned her, some relatives and just random people physically assaulted her and some literally tried to kill her several times (including when she was pregnant with me)! Her in-laws tried to kill her and me with an ax and a garden hoe when I was less than a year old (at that time she didn\u2019t know they were homicidal psychos)! She nearly died giving me birth. People at her workplaces were often complicit in graft, corruption and embezzlement (no big surprise there \u2013 my home country (Ukraine) is notorious for this) and pawned off the blame on her. One of her first jobs was in microelectronics industry: she was working as hard as possible and earning about twice the salary of a high-qualified engineer. She basically starved herself to save up more money for her future kids (I hadn\u2019t been born yet at that time). And then hyperinflation hit and all those savings turned into nothing. After I was born, my father started beating her in his fits of drunken rage. They\u2019ve been separated since I was about 3 yo. Even I contributed to her depression: I was often so irritable with her because of some minutia\u2026 The list goes on \u2013 it\u2019s like death and suffering were following her everywhere\u2026 She told me so many stories that it feels like I\u2019ve vicariously lived a significant portion of her life before my birth. A lot of those stories are heartbreaking and sad. It\u2019s like pieces of the puzzle are falling into place now\u2026 It feels like it's a coherent chapter of a story now. I only wish it was longer and happier\u2026 It felt like it was me and mom against almost everyone around us. Now, I'm basically alone. I don\u2019t have many friends, and most of those I do have are abroad. Most my relatives are gloating pieces of shit. So what am I left with? Social anxiety? Trust issues? Depression that is now worse then ever? I can't even kill myself because mom would never want this. It would be an insult to her. Whenever I think about how it would feel to slash my wrists I almost feel how she starts crying\u2026 I don't want her to cry, I want her to be happy wherever she is and save a place for me\u2026\n\r\nI was about to apply for PhD programs in the US.

And in the meantime, I just have to do some stuff.

I was 18, my siblings were 17 and 11. She worked at a doctors office and just had a random medical emergency. At eleven PM that night they determined she was brain dead and we let her go. They hypothesized a brain steam stroke, but we never really found out why. She was completely healthy. Two months later I left for college. My dad was in a depression for years. He adopted a dog a year after she passed, and the two became great friends. Over the next two years my sister and I moved out, and all he had was my brother and his dog. In 2017 he made the decision to begin dating, and after six months or so of mutual infatuation, proposed to his girlfriend, who, though she would and could never replace our mother, I liked very much. They married in July of 2018. In October of this year, she woke up to find my father had passed away in his sleep. They both had been through monumental stress in their jobs and had a night of drinking and commiserating. He was also dealing with a lasting nerve issue, and had an unintended reaction to medications he was taking. He passed peacefully in his sleep. \n\nFast forward to now. We have all tried to be there for each other. When my mom died, my father created a trust for us all. And to my stepmothers disappointment, never updated it, although he did leave her a $125,000 policy. My dad had amassed quite a trust for the three of us, and now our stepmother has hired an attorney to come against my dad\u2019s estate... for the sole purpose of obtaining more money.

Of the  'close' friends, one lives 15 minutes away. \n\nI am so angry, I understand that it is awkward and difficult, but you would think someone you consider your bestie would want to help look after you at such a time. These people go one about compassion and such for others a lot and it is just really frustrating that apparently, that does not extend to me.  \n\nI just wanted to have a bit of a rant and see if any one has had a similar experience and to wonder whether it's me, maybe i expect too much from people? and maybe i should have just said something sooner. It feels like it would be too late for me to mention it now. \n\nThis also comes when I had been wondering if our friendship was onesided, as I had recently helped out one of the friends financially, and had been helping take them to appointments so that they didn't have to take long bus journeys.  I guess my hunch was right.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

His birthday was in December, and we weathered that. Christmas was very sad for us, but we have come through it. But New Year - I'm dreading it. It's always been a huge celebration in our family, and the thought of entering a new decade without him and leaving him in this year, as terrible as it has been, is breaking my heart.\n\nHow do you cope with this?

I don't think I'm doing a great job at it. I thought with time it would get easier. I tried therapy, medications... I now suffer from panic attack and anxiety when going to bed. Why? Still no idea. So here's my story...\n\nMy family and I celebrated my mom's last Christmas 6 years ago at my place. On January 17th, she was hospitalized for a very bad cough. Diagnostic fell on her on January 27th and she died on February 12th. I'm the one who said her breathing machine wasn't working anymore. I had the chance to say goodbye. With my older sister, we stayed with her body until the doctor came to make it official. We choose her clothes for the funeral home. We prepared the funerals the next day. I cancelled her credit cards and subscriptions 2 days after. I found a picture for the funeral home and I wrote the text announcing her death and when the funerals will take place. I tried to put my own sadness aside to take care of my dad. I did what I had to do at the time. What needed to be done. A month after, I took care of her stuff, helped by my older sister. We packed everything we could. I went back several times at my dad's to clean up her papers. We had a 2nd funeral since it was too cold in February to bury her. And then came all the 1st... At the anniversary, I told my dad it was time for him to move on. She's gone. My own troubles started after. Insomnia found its way into my life more frequently. Then the panic attacks came along. It got worst when trying to meditate, which is supposed to do the opposite. I tried therapy to deal with my grief and my stress. For 2 1/2 years I battled with my therapist. I had to deal with anxiety and panic attack after each therapy session, apart from the fact I had the impression she was judging me all the time. In the meantime, I tried several pills to help me sleep or control my anxiety. All the side effects without proper help. I thought about suicide all the time - still do sometimes - but I'm still there. I'm still a wreck. I know, but I'm getting a little better now. Hypnotherapy is working from time to time and I'm taking a new medication that control my day-to-day anxiety and another to calm me down to sleep. Still not perfect, just hoping I'm heading to the right direction. I know now my life will never be the same and I accept it. Not that I have any other choice. I don't want to become like my family: my dad is a weeping drunken wreck, my older sister is mad at almost everything and my other sister won't accept my mother's death. I'm the one who has the psychological problems and I don't know why. I was never close to my family and my relationship with my mother was getting better as the years went by. I still have one of her vest that's smelled just like her to this day...\n\nThanks for reading. This is just my grief story. What's yours?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Our dad went over to them and we waited. The car came out of their garden blinking, so we knew that he was alive. His wife and daughter went after him into the hospital by car. They got back in an hour, it was strange. I went up to my room and lied on my bed. I heard my father entering our house. He said nothing, just heard my mom saying \"no way\" and started crying.

My grandmother passed away in September after battling the worst case of pneumonia she had suffered from. It was a roller coaster couple of months leading up to her death. First, her kidneys were failing and they thought she might need dialysis. Then she got hospitalized with pneumonia. She stopped trying to get better for a while because she was so exhausted. Then she seemed to gain that little bit of spark and sass I have known her to have. Then she died. It was unexpected and happened with no warning. I was there through it all and honestly, I don't think I'll not see her last moments when I think of her. \n\nShe meant the world to me. She raised me for most of my life. My mom worked and went to nursing school. My dad worked nights as a police officer. She took care of me when they were busy trying to work so they could afford a real house and not the little travel trailer we lived in. My grandmother has always been a presence in my life and was someone who I held so very dear to me. \n\nFor 20 years, I spent Christmas Eve with her. Not once did we miss a Christmas at nana's. That was the time I always looked forward to. Sitting beside her while we opened presents or playing Santa so I could hand her all of her gifts because her happiness was something i strived for. This holiday season was always associated with her. Nothing changed even as my parents divorced. It was tradition, a tradition I loved.\n\nThis was my first Christmas Eve without her. At first, i thought I was fine. My mom and I played some old games my grandmother loved. We talked to drank and had a good time. Christmas day came around and I gathered with family to open gifts and eat dinner. There was a small part of myself that knew there was something missing, but I tried not to pay any attention to it. Everything just didnt have the same spark as it used to. There was none of my nana's laughter as the grandkids played with everything but our gifts. There was no funny stories about my great uncle Roy whom I'm not even sure I've ever met but know his whole life story. There just wasn't the joy I'm used to. \n\nIt didnt hit me until tonight that I missed her more than anything and, despite all the thoughtful gifts I've received, it was probably one of the worst holidays I've had. I love my family, but nothing felt right.\n\nTbh idk why I posted here. I think I'm just not sure what to do with myself. My grief has sort of over taken my life. I've dropped out of nursing school, of which I was in the third semester. I've isolated myself from friends and family. My life is slowly falling apart and I cant keep pretending that I'm okay. I miss my grandmother. I drown myself in video games that make me unhappy and I cant keep up with chores any more. I just need someone to tell me it's going to be okay because all I feel is pain and I can't breath. Grief fucking sucks. \n\nAlso im on my phone and in tears so pls forgive mistakes and grammar and what not. I'm just desperate to vent.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

It\u2019s been very hard, especially on my father. My mother took care of everything for him\u2014household chores, finances, organization\u2014and he\u2019s struggling to wrap his head around everything she did for him and what he has to do to keep up with basic daily living.\n\nMy sister and I live several hours away from home (my sister is twice as far away as I am), and we both have demanding full-time careers and are finishing graduate degrees this year. Both of us have offered to help our father as much as we can, though in very different styles. I\u2019m more of a \u201ctell me what you need, and I\u2019ll step in however I can\u201d person while she is a \u201clet me figure out what you need and do a few things for you\u201d person. Needless to say, she\u2019s taken on a huge amount of work for my dad while being across the state from him. It\u2019s left her worn out, stressed out, and overwhelmed beyond what she\u2019s already experiencing from losing our mother. Meanwhile, my offers to help either of them were largely unacknowledged, leaving me to feel useless, unimportant, and like a failure to my family and my mother.\n\nMy father, in his grief, very quickly became overbearing and argumentative towards my sister. Because of her approach to helping him, my father came to expect she\u2019d do anything he told her to, regardless of what other work she had going on. At one point, he expected her to custom-build a house with space for him in it, something she and her partner could not afford and did not necessarily want to do as they were only just beginning to consider their home-owning options before our mother became terminal. I tried encouraging her to relinquish some of the load to me and encouraging my father to reach out to me for help, both to no avail.\n\nTheir strained interactions hit a boiling point around the holidays. He started getting more argumentative about every little thing she did while staying with him, everything from going to visit our mother\u2019s grave (he was argumentative about why she would even do that, saying she didn\u2019t need to) to the way she played a video game with him (barking out what she should be doing when his instructions were, in fact, incorrect). He also proceeded to complain to my sister about ME not doing anything to help him when I wasn\u2019t within earshot. He furthermore decided that he wants absolutely nothing to do with his mother-in-law or sister-in-law\u2014my mother\u2019s closest surviving relatives who have offered nothing but help and love as they grieve with us\u2014because he just decided that he hates them, making the holiday celebrations incredibly strained and tense. My sister eventually got fed up with his behavior and left his house screaming and in tears, telling him how his behavior had been making her feel for all of these weeks, something she had already expressed to him several times.\n\nI get that this is his grief and my father is taking out his anger and frustration over losing my mother on everyone around him, but it has my sister and I concerned and uncertain of what we should or shouldn\u2019t be doing. We just don\u2019t know how to help or support a man who (A) has no clue how to support himself because of the tireless work my mother did (even while undergoing cancer treatments, she was paying bills for him, making appointments for him, and so on) and (B) who lashes out with anger towards the people who are trying to be the most loving and most patient with him as they too are mourning the worst loss they\u2019ve ever experienced.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

We all assumed as soon as we got the call, that he might have taken his own life, but after a few days, the medical examiner informed us that from what they could tell, he hadn't been eating for a long, long time and they think he died from complications of malnutrition.  He was only 43.\n\nThe detectives said there was nothing at all to indicate suicide or foul play.\n\nAbout a year and half ago, after several hospitalizations and one run in with the police. My siblings and I decided to try to get guardianship for him as we could see that his living like this, on his own, in our parent's house,(He had lived with them all his life and they passed away about 6 years ago,) was possibly dangerous for him.  The run in with the police was that he was caught trying to enter somebody else's property, miles from his home, in bare feet, and a bathrobe in 19 degree weather in the middle of the night.\n\nSince our parents passed he had grown increasingly aggressive and paranoid, including with us.  He would routinely call us or email us with rantings and screaming accusations.\n\nHere is the frustrating part, the mental health system is, with good reason, set up to advocate for his independence at every turn.\n\nThe judges ruled against us in a temporary guardianship hearing, and then, later in an actual guardianship hearing. This may sound strange to those who have not dealt with mental illness of this sort, but trust me, it is amazing how somebody like my brother who is stark raving mad one day, can show up in a Brooks Brothers suit, fully shaven and present themselves as very capable of taking care of themselves the next day.\n\nSo, after that, we would try to reach out to him, but he became more and more isolated, if we didn't hear from him, we'd call the police in his town to do a check on him. This would agitate him to no end. To the extent that he told us he didn't want us to do that anymore. That was four months ago.  So we would send him emails, etc, and never heard from him.\n\nA neighbor of his was out walking in the neighborhood Christmas day and told us that something made him think...\"You know, I can't remember the last time I saw him around the house or leaving the house.\"  He went up to knock on the door and was really worried when he saw my brother's car had a flat tire. He called the police and the went in and found our brother.\n\nThe detective told us that from what he saw, it looked like he probably hadn't been taking his anti-psychotics in quite a while based on the prescriptions he saw and the bottles, etc.\n\nWe've all been talking about how, we saw this coming, we could clearly envision an end for him like this, but we also all saw it as being years and years down the line. Hence, the title of my post: The manner of his death seems so predestined in a way, but for it to come so quickly has us all in a weird state.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

They fostered and then adopted a sibling group of 4 children. They now have 3 biological children. On Dec 11th, my brother called and talked to everyone to tell them of the news. He was happy. He sounded fine. He sounded tired. He had been running around doing errands so he could have a sibling visit at the hospital. His wife had been in the hospital on bed rest for weeks leading to the birth. He'd been stressed for weeks acting as a single parent to 6 kids (10 and under). He asked for help weeks ago.

I wonder if I should want to speak at the memorial. That's not something I can imagine doing, but I also can't imagine no one from the family saying something.

They were all like parents to me my whole life and now that the last one has passed I have found myself in a weird place. \nI wonder if I did enough for them. All of the errands and appointments and time spent and end of life care, in my mind, will never add up to everything they ever did for me my whole life. \nI am left with an extremely empty feeling that no one will ever care for me the way they did. My parents aren't really the best at times. I do have family that I know loves me and cares but its just not quite the same. \nAnd lastly, I find myself not caring about much right now. Kids want to stay up and eat cake until midnight? Be my guest. Family members try to cause drama? Whatever. We are burying my beautiful grandmother on new years eve and I literally cannot wait for everything to be over so I don't have to see that side of the family for a long time. I honestly am not sure how I'm going to get through it watching them all boohoo over her death when they couldn't even send her a card or pick up a phone when she was here. \n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for listening.

My mother is a successful sales-woman and my uncle owned a successful small store. They overcame a lot and proved to my grandparents that the move to America was worth it.\n\nMy sister and I never grew up with a decent father figure. When I was 5, my parents divorced and my biological dad slowly distanced himself. I realize now that he was either not ready for children thus did not put the effort to be a father. My family was truly me, my sister, my mother, and my grandmother. **My uncle began to step up as a father figure in our lives** when we hit middle school, which is also the time he had his daughter. He made us confident, showed us the newest trends, told stories, and showered his family in gifts. He lived and loved tremendously. \n\nIn high school, my mother remarried a man who gave empty promises. He seemed to have a lot of energy to be a family man, but his willingness to care depleted within years. Earlier this March, he walked about from my family without so much of a word. My mother was left hurting, and my sister and I once again looked up to my uncle for support. My uncle kept us together.\n\n**This past October, I received a 2AM call from my aunt that my uncle had died.** Someone was watching his small store. They placed a tracking device on his car during the work hours to follow him home in hopes to take any money bags. My uncle told my aunt that he was almost home, and she said she just needed to step out for a few minutes to run an errand. When he parked his car in the garage, two robbers held him at gun-point and (perhaps mistakenly) shot him. His daughter heard a noise and found him lying in the garage. No one could save him. The FBI and state police have been working diligently as my uncle was a victim of a string of attacks directed to Asian small business owners in our area.\n\n**Everybody has guilt.** We know it doesn't help anyone and we know it isn't true, but we all blame ourselves still for it. Not being at home on time to prevent it. Not having spent more time with him. Not having the money yet to thank him back in gifts. \n\n\\----\n\nEvery day since his passing, **I have been questioning the meaning of life, espeacially my own.** My counselor wants me to see how much meaning his life had and to see how I can measure meaning like that. But it doesn't help. Nothing is helping. I can't stop this dull anger and apathy. I just don't care that much about my future anymore. I feel so much loss of what could have been or what should have been or what can no longer be.\n\nI think it may be because I don't know anyone who has also gone through a loss like mine, but I feel very alone. \n\n***Has anyone felt this or is feeling this?

I was Grasping the concept, that I would be saying goodbye to the one person ever in my life, to truly get me, embrace me, and love me unconditionally. \n\nWe had married at such a young age, we had grown up together over the last 18 years. I didn\u2019t even know how to comprehend the idea, life without the one human in my life, that literally walked beside me hand in hand, never letting go. I didn\u2019t know if I could ever let go of his hand. \n\nMy heart hurt, it plead with the Lord, \u201cAnything, God. Anything. You got it. For you, please just do the miracles I know you can do. Please\u201d I wrestled with how I could make the decision to remove life support, without the kids later resenting me for \u201cgiving up\u201d. \nI was scared. \n\nAnd for the first time, I didn\u2019t have my partner to reassure me on my decision. \u201cGod,\u201d I cried out....\u201dplease help me, I know Jeremy wouldn\u2019t want to be left like this, he\u2019d told me just months prior. But would the kids understand that or believe me, years down the road.\u201d \n\nIt was just too much for me to hear. And I remember, just praying in that moment and asking the Lord to please be my partner in this decision. \n\nAnd as I uttered those words, I overhear, my son, Jacob talking with a chaplain, and he\u2019s telling her...His dad had told him just two weeks prior, he would never want to be kept alive on life support. I couldn\u2019t believe my ears, I said Jacob, your dad told you that?? Yeah, mom. \n\nI was overwhelmed at the timing of such and the simple yet powerful answer to a much heartfelt prayer. \n\nShortly after, I grabbed the doctors and I told them, of Jeremy\u2019s wishes. The door closed, Jacob and Myself crawled into the bed with our very best friend. My head rest in the spot, right under his shoulder - like I\u2019d laid for 18 years. Jacobs arms wrapped around him on the other side.

Yet, in the very last breaths, a peace came over the room. \n\nAs heartbreaking as it was to let my love pass thru.....In those moments, we were held by the highest of angels. I was reminded in those last breathes of every joy we had experienced, every tear we had shed and the remarkable love that will transcend time and space. \n\nIn those last moments, Jacob and I, we looked at each other and made a promise to Jeremy - we must continue living, and we must not give up on the dreams, we had made together as a family. \n\n3 years ago today was the hardest day of my life. But, with Gods help, we are surviving. We are living. We are embracing life. And most of all, we are loving.

I found a few others, if others have any to share, I think that would be lovely. I think they are all so important, whether they are positive and uplifting, or sorrowful, or just capture the essence of loss.\n\n\u201cGrief can destroy you --or focus you. You can decide a relationship was all for nothing if it had to end in death, and you alone. OR you can realize that every moment of it had more meaning than you dared to recognize at the time, so much meaning it scared you, so you just lived, just took for granted the love and laughter of each day, and didn't allow yourself to consider the sacredness of it. But when it's over and you're alone, you begin to see that it wasn't just a movie and a dinner together, not just watching sunsets together, not just scrubbing a floor or washing dishes together or worrying over a high electric bill. It was everything, it was the why of life, every event and precious moment of it. The answer to the mystery of existence is the love you shared sometimes so imperfectly, and when the loss wakes you to the deeper beauty of it, to the sanctity of it, you can't get off your knees for a long time, you're driven to your knees not by the weight of the loss but by gratitude for what preceded the loss. And the ache is always there, but one day not the emptiness, because to nurture the emptiness, to take solace in it, is to disrespect the gift of life.\u201d \n\n\\- Dean Koontz, Odd Hours\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cWe bereaved are not alone.
