I\u2019m single and have no kids, so she was like my child. When I had no one or moved to new places where I knew no one, she was there. She meant everything to me. Making the decision to euthanize her was one of the most horrible moments of my life. I have a lot of guilt surrounding my loss and I miss her so much.\n\nI am a Christian so I turned to grief share thinking I found a faith based group to help with my grief. I went to the first meeting tonight and the video was very relatable to me even though it was talking about the loss of humans. While I didn\u2019t share openly about my pet, I felt so glad to have found the group.\n\nAfter the meeting was over, the group leader asked about my loss so I explained how I lost my dog. She said she was sorry and asked about her, but then said that this group deals with \u201cvery serious stuff\u201d and is not the group for me. She said they have to maintain the \u201cquality of the group\u201d.\n\nI have been crying ever since leaving the meeting hours ago.

If I can\u2019t turn to the church for support then where can I...I would never try to make my grief out to be worse than anyone else\u2019s but it does matter.

She was a shy and awkward little kid who blossomed into a very beautiful and athletic young woman who was very, very bright (800 English and 760 Math on the SATs, 35 on the ACTs for whatever it was worth), had tons of loving friends, and had whatever boyfriends she wanted whenever she wanted them. Unfortunately, we realized too late that her patterns of completely manic activity (sleeping two hours a night, churning through homework assignments way ahead of time, going on night-time runs) followed by sleeping for twelve and more hours and inertness indicated she was probably also bipolar. We think she probably started using pain pills and went on to heroin to try to even out her symptoms.\n\nWhat can I say about her? She was a wreck who could disappear for days at a time, break promise after promise, and resort to losing an argument by breaking every glass in sight. She was also witty and charismatic and fiercely loyal to her best friends. It came to our attention that she paid them back for the money she borrowed for her drugs well before she paid us back, LMAO. She was a college dropout who knew so much about politics that I stopped talking to her about it not because we had big disagreements (we both Felt the Bern, ourselves) but just because talking to her made me feel like a misinformed moron. She was a lot of different people in one who on one hand could drain all the energy out of me with the bullshit she pulled and on the other I could call after the worst breakup of my life and hang up on four hours later laughing and in high spirits. She was my baby sister and I loved her with everything in me.\n\nThe last time we all got together (this would be me 34/M, my twin 34/F, my brother 30/F, and her 25/F, two years ago) we all went out on the town. Little Sis had been out of rehab for a few months and holding a job, living with our parents, and generally getting it together, but still not doing so great. When I visited home, sometimes I would catch her staring off into a corner with a deep palpable sadness that would make something in my heart twinge. As the evening went on she started laughing and giggling more and turning into her old best self with a little booze in her (despite her massive problems with opiates she was never more than a social drinker, and even then she preferred just smoking a joint). I was so fucking thrilled to have her back. Three weeks later Little Sis made the mistake that a lot of relapsing heroin addicts make, trying to do go right back to her old dosage without accounting for how their tolerance dropped.\n\nThere\u2019s something weirdly old fashioned to me about how coffins look between the brass handles and dark wood and the way all the silk lining is tufted, frilled, and made to spill over the edges. They look like they\u2019re explicitly made for little old ladies to lie in. Seeing my 25-year-old sister lying in one of them made no sense. She was in a dress she almost never wore, barefoot too - she really didn't like wearing shoes when she didn't have to, and she really didn't have to in a silk lined coffin. I still don't have words for it.\n\nMy Mom comes from a German Catholic background so she\u2019s always been anal about Christmas trees. When we were kids starting mid-December she\u2019d spend a few days throwing all the lights and ornaments onto the tree and then stay up late until New Year\u2019s quietly looking at it before going to bed. Christmas 2017 she successfully got the tree up and decorated but when I visited home for the first Christmas after Little Sis died I noticed she stayed up late every night drinking and sobbing, looking at the tree to provide some kind of solace that it couldn\u2019t. That\u2019s the saddest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. This past Christmas the tree didn\u2019t go up at all.\n\nI don't really know what to take away from it. I miss her. My brother and sister and I are closer than we've ever been - we've started to call ourselves the Triforce. Our parents are alcoholic wrecks over it. I'm in an engineering field closely connected to combatting global warming, and in a way she's driving me - I don't want to add more things on top of Little Sis to the list of things that used to be better about the world.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Having to explain how I knew her has been a story in and of itself since I am only 22, how could I be 'friends' with someone over twice my age? My girlfriend went to college with a few non-traditional students in their 40s and they became very close. He invited my girlfriend to his house for various parties and get togethers throughout college and by extension I eventually got invited too. My girlfriend and I are the youngest of his friends that come to hang out and I knew her the least amount of time and I'm really struggling with justifying my sadness over the situation. I know deep down that the time you knew someone doesn't really matter, but seeing my girlfriend be so okay with everything when this woman was basically her mother is hard.

Well anyway, what I\u2019m mainly writing this about is because of the fact her birthday just passed. So of course this has me feeling a lot of different emotions.

I didn\u2019t make a HBD/rip post on social media, I didn\u2019t let go of balloons, didn\u2019t sing happy birthday or blow out a fake cake with a candle.

Should I have made a Facebook post for her?

No one called to tell me until the funeral home made the 4 pm call. After talking to some friends and relatives of my mother's, I found out my younger brother had spent the night and had left at midnight. He was the one who found her when he came back at 6 am.\n\nI was told within a couple hours of her death, my brother had people there helping him remove anything and everything of value from her apartment. Still no notification to me during all this.\n\nMy mother, brother, and I haven't been on speaking terms for a long time. They have both done some very shitty greedy things over the year and I finally grew numb to both of them and just removed them from my life. Mom has tried a few times to talk to me but I just could not do it. I've been burned so many times that, to me, she literally become a stranger to me. But something inside me still wants to think I should feel more than I do. Occasionally I'll see or hear something that makes me think of the better side to her and some tears well up but it never lasts long.\n\nI guess what bothers me the most is that, growing up, mom and I were close. She is responsible for my love of music and literature and, when I started dating, she often ferried me and whomever my girlfriend was on dates. She also did a lot of weird shit too, like punishing us kids to show her younger sister she was a disciplinarian too. When I started working she would take my paycheck and if I complained it was always the free room and board but. Mind you, I didn't mind helping but I know my money went towards extravagances for her and my stepfather. Anyway, there was a lot more that went on that I've thought about as I got older that just doesn't seem right now but it is what it is.\n\nTomorrow I have to go to the funeral home for I don't know what. I really want nothing to do with it all and, if my brother is such a piece of shit as to take her for whatever she had left, then let him have at it. It's his soul and conscious anyway, not mine.\n\nI don't know what emotions, if any, will hit me over the next 3 days. Hard to believe she's gone though. I always imagines things differently before everything went sour between us but I've known for a long time those were thoughts from a different time. Part of me wishes things were different too but damn I tried so many times and every time it was the same shit. She chose her path though and she chose to let my piece of shit brother reign over her life.\n\nStill feel like I should feel more or sonething different thought so I thought I'd post and see if anyone else has experienced anything similar. It might help me come to terms with things.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He was the best human being I\u2019ve ever met and his wife was a saint. They were the couple I looked up to as the best example of what marriage is. He beat stage 4 once and as soon as he was told he was in remission, it had come back. He couldn\u2019t go through the treatments again and decided to let go. It was an extremely difficult death to deal with.\n\nA couple years later, my mom\u2019s long term boyfriend had surgery for his heart and died on the table. She had struggled for my entire life with bi-polar and depression and had tried over the years to take her own life quite a few times. After his death, she succeeded and passed a month later.\n\nA year after that, my FIL died of sepsis in the hospital. He was told on many occasions not to drink with his medication and to eat better but ignored it, so essentially killed himself as well. It was so hard to watch my husband have to make the decision and watch the life go out of his father.\n\nA year or so after that, my aunt was found dead by my uncle on her farm, supposedly a fall or attack by one of their animals.\n\nThen, my best friend\u2019s uncle died. A couple months later, her dad. She knew he would go soon and sped up her wedding plans hoping he would be there, but passed unexpectedly as soon as they started planning. A month after that, she called to say they had to put down their beautiful dog as she had developed a heart issue suddenly and they had to let her go.\n\nMeanwhile, and I know I\u2019m so so lucky to even know my grandparents and have them in my life for so long (my parents had me at 19) but my grandfathers on both sides have health issues, one with Parkinson\u2019s and lives in Holland and one losing his health everyday and will be fully blind soon.\n\nI\u2019ve also been battling my own health scares and had multiple colposcopies in the last couple years.\n\nLastly, my first pupper and the sweetest soul I\u2019ve ever met in this lifetime is twelve, has had health issues her whole life, and has recently rapidly declined to being both blind and deaf and we\u2019re worried every day about having to make the choice about when it\u2019s her time.\n\nThis is so much more than I thought my heart could ever take. It sneaks up on you here and there, or sometimes it hits you all at once, or sometimes you think you\u2019re fine but a passing memory takes you down because hey, it\u2019s your birthday and you used to hate your mom calling you at 6:59am on your birthday because that\u2019s when you were born, but now you\u2019d give anything to have that one more time, despite your strained relationship when she was still here.\n\nIt\u2019s just...so much. And when you\u2019re the \u2018strong one\u2019 everyone depends on, it can really take a toll. \n\nThanks for reading if you made it this far. Despite the bad times, there\u2019s a lot I value in this life and continually try to make the most of it. Just needed to let a little bit of the pain out. If you\u2019re struggling, know you aren\u2019t alone. And I hope things get better for you soon.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Procedure is risky, could potentially die..We think it over and she decides initially not to do the surgery and comes back home. She goes back on Thursday to the hospital after realizing how serious it is and how this could eventually kill her if it\u2019s not treated. Doctor sends her back home for whatever reason and says to do this as an elective procedure for next Friday since there is small chance if rupture soon. Mother disagrees and Oma goes to another hospital Friday to get it done sooner. A UTI shows up and the same doctor is in charge of the surgery. Decide to wait for the UTI to clear before proceeding with surgery.I called her to check up on her everyday and she said she was good and is spending time with my mom. I was sure that she would be fine. Maybe I was afraid it was actually worse than it actually was.\n\nWell Monday...her aneurysm ruptured.

I\u2019m honestly just feeling alone and looking for outlets where I can and I feel like it was just lost a swallowed up there. \n\nToday was the first time in almost two years that I felt like I just wanted it all to end. Almost 3 years ago my mom died (I was 22 and she was amazing-we talked all the time and I felt so loved by her). When she first got sick was when my depression started. It was like an anxious treadmill of everything that Ive done wrong and everything that wasn\u2019t going well in my life and everything that anyone did to hurt me. I thought numerous times of how I just wanted to die so it would be over. Less than a year after my mom died, my boyfriend of 4 years dumped me. The week after he dumped me was the last time I felt truly hopeless and wanted to die. After we broke up, I felt free and focused on myself. It was still hard sometimes but I felt more like myself than ever. Fast forward two years later to now, I\u2019ve recently moved and got a new job to be near a new boyfriend and be near my sister. I thought things were going better and then the last few weeks I have just been exhausted. I was trying to check in with myself and give myself time to rest and trying to make myself go do things etc. I thought it was normal adjusting to a new place and a new work schedule so I was just trying to give myself time. Then yesterday I found out my sister in law (a very sweet and normal woman) had a mental break and was arrested and jailed until today when she was finally released to a hospital for treatment. I\u2019m a mess. This somehow triggered and undid all the work I had done to heal from losing my mom and to have healthy approaches in the midst of difficulty. I felt like I was punched in the stomach and that nothing else in my world feels normal. I knew I was a mess yesterday so I took off work today hoping it would help. My boyfriend came over and we went and did stuff with friends. Then we came back and he started to get out his computer while we were still talking about stuff and I felt so hurt. I couldn\u2019t understand why, in my moment of pain, he couldn\u2019t just remain focused on me. I walked out of the room. He then was really angry at me for walking out and I tried to explain that he had hurt me by choosing to play computer games when I just needed him to be present and it escalated. He said he was just getting set up because the conversation seemed like it ended. I said that still felt hurtful. I ties to explain all I was going through and nothing was really fixed. I feel like I should have just kept my mouth shut or stayed and talked to him before I walked out the first time. I feel like I probably was being unfair and he needed to destress too. I\u2019m already a mess again. I feel like I messed everything else up more. I feel like a failure on so many levels. I feel so lost and alone I just called the Suicide hotline because I didn\u2019t know who else to call. I felt like I just wanted someone to shoot me and take me out of my misery but I also know that would only hurt my family more. And that there is a lot more I want to do with my life. I tried to talk to the woman on the line but I got embarrassed and just ended the conversation super quickly. I cried and I know I\u2019m not really going to harm myself. I\u2019m going to try to find a counselor and make an appointment but that often takes so long. I just want to be heard and understood. I feel like my boyfriend doesn\u2019t understand how much I actually hurt. How helpless I feel. It seems like he thinks I\u2019m overreacting. I have no control over the situation so why should I be upset. I just need someone to let me be upset. To understand that I am broken and want to die but will not actually hurt myself. For someone to see all the pain I have right now and let me a needy mess for like a couple days before I have to move one. I know that\u2019s too much to put on him and I wish I had kept it together. I just want to not hurt so much. I want my mom back. I want to feel at home. I want to not be tired. I want my sister in law to be safe and my brother and their baby to feel safe with her.

{"post_id": "dd6kf8", "created_utc": 1570191446, "title": "I miss her so much", "author": "noneya_beeswax", "self_text": "My grandmother was my whole world. My mom had me at a young age and she is a very selfish woman. I spent the majority of my childhood with my grandma as my mom always wanted to go party more than spend time with me. I thank God for that because my grandma raised me to be a much better person than my mother did. \n\nMy grandma showed me what truly unconditional, selfless love looks like. We have been very close all my life, like two peas in a pod. When my mom wasn\u2019t dumping me off at her house, I would ask to go there because I loved being with her and at her home I felt much more comfortable. I loved going to church with her, yard sales, shopping, and just spending time at home together. She was my landline, my rock in a sea of uncertainty and mayhem. She was an eye in the storm. And I never failed to tell her that I loved her, but I regret not telling her just how much.\n\nAs I became an unruly teen I spent a little less time with her. But I made sure to call her pretty regularly (more than any of her other grandchildren\u2014we were really very very close\u2014I consider her more my mother than my actual mother) and visit when I could.\n\nFast forward to her ongoing heart trouble. This happened when I was about 16 (I\u2019m 28 now). She was a very strong woman who worked her whole life. She was also single as long as I knew her because my grandfather cheated on her and she kicked him out. So she was a single mother who worked her ass off for her family and then she continued to do so for me. She\u2019d had heart issues before but didn\u2019t want to worry me so she never talked about it. Then I got a call from my aunts that she had to have another open heart surgery at a big hospital two hours away. I immediately dropped everything and left with my aunts to go stay nearby and be there for the operation. This fact here shows what my mother is like: my grandma had 3 daughters 0 sons\u2014my two aunts and mom. Me and my two aunts were there for grandmas surgery. It took much longer than it should\u2019ve and when they finally called us back we were told that grandma was blind and it was probably irreversible. Mom still didn\u2019t show until we told her she HAD to.\n\nThis was a huge blow. Grandma was a very independent and self sufficient person, and her blindness turned all our lives on their heads. It was devastating, but we were so grateful we still had her in our lives. She was just more of a fragile old lady and less of the powerhouse of a woman I admired so dearly.\n\nIt happened pretty quickly after that. My usually sharp witted, big time reader, loved to run around with friends and do crossword puzzles grandma had a whole different lifestyle. Her mind started to go quickly. I stayed with her for a period during my early 20\u2019s and that was the first sign that something was very wrong. I would enter a room that would be empty except for her and discover her talking to herself. Once her mind started slipping my mom and aunts stopped taking care of her, stuck her in a nursing home, sold off all her things (I still don\u2019t have anything that was hers to remember her by despite how close we were) and my one aunt took her house.\n\nI went to visit grandma a couple times in the nursing home. I blame aunts and mom uprooting her routine and life for this one but... she no longer seemed to even recognize who I was. She was fully delusional and didn\u2019t even understand when I told her about college (which she had been SO proud of me for) or life in general. Out of the handful of times I went to visit her, I walked out and drove home a sobbing mess.\n\nI know it was selfish, but it was just too painful. I couldn\u2019t see her like that, reduced to a shell of the woman I loved so dearly.\n\nI got the call in January of this year. Mammy (grandma) wasn\u2019t doing well at all, everyone needs to come to the hospital.\n\nWe did vigil at her bedside for three days before she succumbed to her illness. I was calm and collected the entire three days and the second she was declared gone and stopped breathing, my whole being shattered. I will never be the same without her, and it\u2019s so hard to explain to people how I felt she was gone before she was actually gone but it\u2019s still crushing my soul. \n\nMy selfish mom and aunts are just now having any kind of service for her. I\u2019ve been angry over this since losing her.\n\nI wrote a few words to say at her memorial this month. I am also 14 weeks pregnant with my first baby. Rehashing those memories and my heartbreak was so difficult for me. I\u2019m still sitting here sobbing because I miss her so very much.\n\nAnd nobody wants to hear about my grief so I\u2019m keeping it all in and it\u2019s killing me.\n\nI miss her so much.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

This new version of me will be the person that traverses this 'bad' version of my future, the version my worst nightmares were made of.\n\nPeople have started talking about Christmas and I can't believe time has passed so quickly considering I feel like I am standing still.  The other thing that I have noticed is that I think I am having as existential crisis.  I no longer care about anything even though the people around me can't see that.  I realise how insignificant of a spec we are in the bigger picture and I question why we as humans drive forward like little working ants for what purpose? Ultimately nothing.\n\nI see happy families with their children laughing and enjoying life, and I feel like I am on the outside of a window looking in. I have seen beyond the veil into something I hope they never have to experience.  I don't feel like I will ever experience joy or hope again, it just doesn't seem possible.

Quick back ground:  We were toxic for each other.  She was a big part of my life and our friendship was more like unrequited love.  She was bulimic and when we were kids I always took care of her.  We were important to each other in our formative years.  Flash forward: I met my wife.  My BFF had a son.  I lost touch with my best friend but there was always love for each other.  I google her name and find her obituary.  This has been very traumatizing for me. I can't talk to my wife (shes a sweetheart and she tries) because they never got a long and its strange to talk about someone I loved with my wife.  The only thing I've done to cope was take her picture and print out her obituary and place it in a file way in the back my desk. I feel like I put her away. I ignored her for so long so I wouldn't make my wife feel uncomfortable or upset.  My best friend tried reaching out to me for so long and I was always short or ignored her.  I feel guilty, and I feel incredibly sad.  And it's starting to pour out in negative ways. I find myself getting frustrated with my wife and I get mad at her sometimes.  I need help.  Do they have support groups for things like this? Where you aren't a relative but its still a loss? What are things I can do?  Another thing:  her family (which she didn't have a great relationship with) only had a memorial, nobody knows shes dead, it's like she never existed.

I had my mother to catch the grief of her mother for me. There\u2019s no one there to catch mine now. It\u2019s now all fallen. I feel the loss of my nana in these days too. I imagine the warmth and the feeling of being known by these women. I will not be known like this again. What a lonely place, to not be known in this way. The knowing of your fresh soul. A soul that is so raw and untouched by the world. Not of the person I\u2019ve become as the world and life has shaped me, but the soul I was in the purest form. This is the maternal soulmate love I feel. I let the ideas and paths of previous travelers wash over me. Finding your person in your heart, continuing the relationship, knowing them in more profound ways. I love and admire these people, but I do not believe them. I don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t want this to be true. At 30 years old I was so far from losing my mom. There was so much that was not said, so much not done.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I feel like I need an extended period of time away from everyone and everything to try process this whole thing just to see if that helps. A few years ago I did two 6week stints in the space of a year in a psychiatric hospital for treatment of depression/anxiety etc and my doctor has told me this is always an option if everything becomes too much. I feel like there's no words to describe how I'm feeling on a daily basis. I'm fucking angry at nothing and everything at the same time. Sometimes I feel like fucking screaming and roaring until I can't anymore. I think about it and him every second of every day. Just want to lay in bed turn off my phone and fucking disappear. I'd turn to alcohol if it didn't interfere with the concussion I got last year and all the medication I am on for depression anxiety etc. I'd smoke weed  if it didn't make my anxiety worse. I'd disappear somewhere if I didn't have financial obligations. I'd contemplate suicide if I didn't have so many loving friends and family that it would just completely destroy. I don't forsee a time I won't ever not feel like this. I wonder if he's up there somewhere, looking down on me, and what would he think of how I'm handling this. I'm afraid to speak honestly about how I'm feeling with my friends for the fear of being seen as melodramatic. Only since he's died have I realised how deeply I loved him and needed him in my life. He feels like a stranger now for some reason, like a distant memory, even though its only been a year. I'm trying my best to get on with life, new job, running a marathon in a few weeks, going to Japan in a month with friends. Yet it all feels like it could fall apart at any moment. People ask if I want to talk about it but there's nothing to be said that hasn't already been said, and plus I can't really put into words how I feel, other than to cry uncontrollably. I cry every second day, if not every day. I keep in constant touch with his family and girlfriend, trying to help in anyway I can, I ask my other friends how they are coping and they do likewise  for me. But it all seems fruitless. I'd check myself into hospital tomorrow if I didn't have so many obligations in the next two months. Maybe I will after. I look around and see others in the situation, who are equally distraught, managing to keep it together and function, and wonder why I can't,   why I have to be the fucking mess who can't keep it together. Finding it hard to recall all the good times we had in those 9 years, instead im plagued with memories of the 7 months of him being sick, losing his hair, losing his sight in one eye, him looking progressively sick, him in the last two weeks of his life, in tremendous pain with us trying to make him comfortable in his bed, watching him lose his mind as the cancer spread to his brain, becoming incoherent with psychosis like symptoms. Then having to say goodbye to him on his death bed holding his hand  while he was semi conscious not knowing that he was days away from death. Memories of the wake, his almost unrecognisable face which was cold to the touch as I kissed his forehead when I said goodbye for the final time. His funeral, carrying his coffin out of the church. His cremation, watching his coffin disappear behind the curtains knowing that it would be the last time I'd ever see him in any form. Seeing his parents so distraught. All this on repeat in my head. He was the best friend I could ask for, a brother being a more fitting title. he was my first port of call when I had problems and my shoulder to cry on when I needed it. He saw me through so many lows in my life and was there with me celebrating the highs. I did everything I could in those 7 months of illness to be the best friend I could, and I currently try to be the best source of support for his family and girlfriend, knowing hed do the same if the shoe was on the other foot, but it all seems pointless for some reason, like putting a band aid on bullet wound. I know this is my grief and I should own it and not compare myself to others but I can't help it. Maybe hospitalisation in the near future is the best thing, iv done so much to try help myself, clean diet, taking all my medications every day, off alcohol and cigarettes since march, excercising 5 days a week, seeing counselors. While all the above help somewhat, overall  I'm just overwhelmed. I know there are other things in my life that I need to fix aswell that are probably contributing to all this, career uncertainty, lack of sexual relationships etc but this just overshadows everything. I'm not looking for up votes or sympathy, I just wanted to vent anonymously with people who are going through the same shit. I hope you are all OK. Thanks for reading my rant.

Mum (65) died on 14 September 2019 after being diagnosed with advanced lung cancer complicated by Lupus-related interstitial lung disease in May 2019. She was at home and my brother and I were there with her in her last moments - just as she wanted. \n\nMum's been sick for 30 years with Lupus - and my brother (younger) and I (38) have seen her fight all these years with incredible strength, faith and positivity. But we've also gone through most of our lives (and a greater part of our childhood) thinking we would lose her during one of her many operations or flare ups. We have chronic illness ourselves (I had a kidney transplant caused by Sjorgen's. My brother was the donor).\n\nAnyway, mum accepted her diagnosis with her typical grace and preparedness. She always said she had enjoyed many bonus years. \"I am reaching the end of my race,\" she said. \n\nHer siblings did not take the diagnosis or what followed, well. Cognisant of the high-risk low-reward outcomes, Mum decided on Chemo. We left all her medical and care decisions up to her - mum knew best; she'd been a patient for most of her life.\n\nFor the record, my brother was not optimistic about it, while I remained neutral but harboured some hope it would work. But chemo took too much out of her cos of her low baseline and she stopped after 2 rounds (in July) so she could spend her last days at home with us. \n\nEarly in the diagnosis, we made sure mum documented her wishes for care (formally with her medical team). We also talked a lot about what was meaningful for her, what quality of life was to her and what kind of death she wanted. \nShe even planned her funeral with us. She was not afraid and ready to go - she only said she could not bear to leave my brother and I, but had to \"gently let go\". \n\nHer siblings (who really love her dearly) were devastated and insisted on her taking a 'natural cure'. None of them could accept that she was dying - and soon. We tried our best to prepare them to no avail. Instead, we were seen as not being devastated enough and losing hope.\n\nThey were also against her pain management regime and vilified morphine and chemo, believing it to be the cause of her decline. We tried to educate them, even organised a medical family conference to clear the air. \n\nAlmost a month after losing mum, the grief is starting to really sink in and it's a bit of a struggle to get by each day. For me, it's hard waking up knowing my world does not have mum in it anymore.\n\nMy brother and I know the whole cycle of grief thing, so we are coping, but it is what is it - a godawful tough time. But now I hear rumblings from my aunts and uncles about how we \"forced her to do chemo\" (thus killing her) and other insanely hurtful things. \n\nMy mum is very loved and I am trying to see how their anger is part of their grief. But it makes it extremely hard to have them direct so much misunderstanding towards us. We're essentially alone now (fathet is an asshole and we're estranged - but that's another story) and instead of setting aside their (petty) anger to support us, we have to handle everything post-mum on our own. Not even one of them has reached out to ask how we are or offer help. \n\nIt is making this terrible time even harder than it has to be. I know I should just ignore them, but it hurts nonetheless. \n\nI'm sorry for the long post. But I really needed to get this off my chest.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Your brother is gone.\"", "author": "seri53", "self_text": "My brother died last Sunday.\n\nThe title of this post...is the voicemail i got from my father, the words i heard through his helpless sobs. I live out of state and was commuting home from work. I didn't hear my phone in my bag. It's surreal. He was 31. \n\nMy mother died 3 years ago from cancer. My uncle, my father's best friend, 6 months after that. Cancer. My husband's cousin 10 months after that. Cancer. We are all just kernels in a chicken coop. We thought we could be happy again. My father is numbed by sudden loss.\n\nMy brother struggled a lot after my mom died. He always struggled to some degree with depression and decidedly took matters into his own hands to fight his pain. I feel we all tried: myself, my father, my cousins. We tried talking and tried clinics and counselors and he refused it every time. Every. Time. He insisted he was smarter than them, he could do it himself. He ignored my efforts, he ignored my father's pleas, he just gave in. Whatever shit he was on, the extent of which is unknown to me, robbed me of my brother a long time ago. I mourned him for months before his death, just feeling in my heart that i would get that phone call eventually, and i was powerless to stop it. He told me once, \"You can't fix everything, you know.\" And my response was: but why can't i try? It doesn't work that way, i get it. But why can't i try? He was right though, wasn't he? I tried and failed.\n\nCould i have tried harder? I don't know. I'm not shocked, that's what fucking sucks the most. I'm fucking angry. I can't blame him either, I never could; but, my God! What an unfortunate waste his soul succumbed to. He was really so great, at least before this shit. He was funny and smart, stubborn and salty but he knew how to make people laugh. He loved art and music and books and the outdoors. We were supposed to grow old together, now we never will. My toddler will never know his Tio and of course he loved him. The rest of us living will have voids in our hearts forever but, really, how many voids can a heart withstand before it becomes a void itself? My father is numb. My son keeps him smiling.\n\nBut it's a strange feeling, indeed, thinking you will end up burying your childhood family alone. I just keep trying to tell myself we were happy once. That's good. We were luckier than many, challenged like most. People have done more with less.\n\nI don't even know why i'm here. Im new to this Reddit stage but i dont like social media like the rest of my generation does. I wouldn't be surprised if this soliloquy  was left unread or scoffed at. Maybe I'm just here to write. I'm not looking for validation. I just can't piece out what i feel; my mind wont let me. I want answers. I want one answer. I want an idea or a thought or something that could explain what the FUCK, WHY the FUCK, but there isn't one and no one can tell me. Because you can't fix everything. He left me nothing but memories, and we are all just stories in the end, right? But could i be blamed for wanting a little more?  I would've given up solving all the problems in my life just to fix one of his. He wouldn't let me in. Is that an excuse or an answer? Is it neither? It just is. I don't know anymore.\n\n\nAnd so it goes.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

She was only 57 but it wasn\u2019t an unexpected death and I\u2019d already been grieving for months before she passed. I did all I could to prepare for the final loss. I went to counselling. I spoke to my mum about what her wishes were and about how I would cope. I wrote myself letters, I took notes from my mum and went on antidepressants. \nSince she died, I did feel like a lot of my prep had helped - I mean, it didn\u2019t stop me hurting but I felt like I was still living life. I was pleased to go back to work and threw myself at it - I\u2019d also been promoted just before she died and wanted to show I could kick ass at my new job. I signed up for things I had been prevented from doing when I was using all my spare time to care for my mum like Spanish classes, yoga, home improvements. I was grieving but making the most of life. \nThen a few weeks back I started getting a cold which turned in to an ear infection. I was in so much pain and had to go off work. I\u2019ve been off for two weeks now and don\u2019t expect to go back for a few weeks. My doctor said my physical symptoms were all related to my grief. I\u2019ve been almost bed ridden for what seems like ages.... which is a shit thing to say considering my mum was literally bed ridden for so long and she managed to keep a brave face. \nWhy is my body doing this to me. I can\u2019t help but feel like my bosses will think less of me and I\u2019ve ruined my career prospects. But I know I just can\u2019t carry on like normal right now. I feel like my symptoms would probably lift immediately if I could have just a five minute conversation with my mum - she\u2019d sympathise with me, call me her baby, her pumpkin pie and just make me feel better. Instead I\u2019m feeling like my body is trying to stand in the way of my desire to get on with life. \nWhat more does grief want from me. Is it because I went back to work and didn\u2019t give 100% to my grief monster straight after she died so now it\u2019s seeking revenge?\nWill people at work understand my being off sick? \nFuck this is all so confusing.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I'm now 50 years old and feel like my life is dominated by grief and remembrance, sliced, diced and divided by the death of my mother in 1983 when I was 14, and of my wonderful nephew in 2006 when I was 37. I now look at the two deaths as bookends, one beginning a new life of loss that gradually faded into acceptance, and the other an abrupt reminder that we've got no control over anything in life, that there's really no stopping death when it visits us.\n\nMy mom's death colored my entire adolescence, early adulthood and full on adulthood, while my nephew's death has deeply impacted my middle age life and life as father. That continuum of grief is what haunts me everyday of my life, no matter how much good I have in life, no matter how high the highs can be. I've now lived the bulk of my life overshadowed by grief, sorrow and remembrance. Years of therapy have helped me establish a framework through which I view all this, but it's still there, an emptiness that never fills. \n\nThe space across that continuum is only filled with memories.. It's a very pleasant thought to consider that the memory of another person will live forever in your head and heart. In fact, I admit, this is one of the main thing that keeps me going. It's often the idea of someone, fleshed out by their physical being, that makes them real to us. It might even be the only reality, this idea of what people are to us. But let me be the first to say this, memories fucking suck.\n\nSure they're good to get you through, but smack in the face of the flipping calendar pages and the clicking on of years memories fade, they change, they even morph into fiction. I'm tired of memories, for all their power to remind and influence. I want the presence of physical reality, the here and now of a person. Thirty six years on and the memory of my mom's voice, the thoughts of her scratching my head while I laid my head in her lap while watching TV will always bring me to tears. The memories of my nephew hanging from arm like a monkey, of taking him to get his passport for a planned trip, of sharing music and books with him, it's too much. \n\nI get the feeling that the longer you live with memories, the more they seem like the ghosts of your loved ones past. Never changing, always static. Like a clip of film playing on a loop inside your brain. With endless memories, I'm starting to feel like a haunted house filled with the shadows of the dead. No matter how old I grow or how many new lives and experiences inhabit my body and soul, there's all those memories looping around in perpetuity, reminding me of what was lost.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Back in 2014, the only friend I had in high school unexpectedly passed away. We'd just kindled our friendship after years of drifting apart. We talked on the phone every day, hung out, made plans to move in together and travel to India. Then, one day when I was at the gym, I opened up Facebook and saw a \"Rest in Peace\" message on his Facebook wall. Suddenly everything made sense: why he hadn't picked up my call the night before, why he'd ignored our plans to get together in the morning. I still remember how I didn't believe it at first, but nevertheless felt overcome by physical nausea and dread. \n\nAnyway... to make a long story short, I'm not a very emotionally attuned person. My feelings are usually pretty buried, and I'm not the best at recognizing them. But it's apparent now, today, that my friend's sudden, rapid passing has impacted me in some subtle ways. \n\nSomething I have struggled with in recent years is the fear of sudden loss. Whenever a friend goes offline for a few days--or even my girlfriend falls asleep at home after without saying good night--my heart beats a little fast, and I wonder what may've happened. \n\nI know fearing the worst is illogical. But it's compounded by a lot of things--how I hurt people when I was younger, how my grandpa was diagnosed with cancer despite being in visibly good health, how a female friend who drunk called me wound up passing out and getting molested moments later... these things hurt me in the moment, made me or angry or sad, but I've always tried not to dwell on things.\n\nSometimes it makes me feel cold, because I imagine other people must feel constantly beset with grief, and I'm not like that. Yet I can see the consequence, my own emotionality, just below the surface-how quick my mind is to jump to the worst-case scenario. \n\nI mean, every so often, I realize that I don't think about my dead friend every day. We were only close for a few years, in high school, and then we drifted apart before briefly getting closer. But he was my only friend then, the only connection I'd kept to that part of my life. \n\nAnd I guess, even if his memory doesn't come to mind every day, what happened is still there, and it's easier now to see how his death left a psychological scar than it was then.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

She died from cancer. In the month prior to her passing her health had drastically taken a turn for the worse. If cancer wasn\u2019t bad enough, we believed that she had suffered a stroke. There were so many things that we were seeing our mom go through that we just didn\u2019t understand, fearing we were losing her, angry that God was taking her away.\nThere are three of us siblings, and our dad who survives her, but we are barely surviving. For a couple of us that lived close to our parents, we did our best to help out in any way we could. My sister, bore the brunt of this. She was with my parents for the last two weeks that my mom was alive. She was there 24/7, caring for them, helping my dad to help my mom. She saw how the fear of losing his wife was crippling my dad. Lack of sleep, tensions were high, frustrations higher. We did not blame him. We were worried for him. In her fear of not knowing what to do my sister reached out via phone calls and texts to my brother and I. Pouring her heart out over what she had to endure for those last days. Again, we were merely worried that our dad wasn\u2019t coping with all the stresses of losing our mom. In the days after my mom had passed my brother came to be with my dad, he decided that he would share these conversations that we had with him, this, needless to say, did not go over well. My brother betrayed a trust, because he lived far away he asked that we keep him aware of everything that was going on. So that\u2019s what we did! We didn\u2019t expect that he was going to turn these conversations around on us and use them to shed a negative light on my sister and myself. \nMy dad will hardly speak to us, we have made our apologies for any misunderstanding, we have made known our love and support for him, but he won\u2019t move on. Even though he says \u201cthere is nothing to forgive\u201d, \u201cI just want to move on\u201d, he won\u2019t.\nTo top this off, my dad and my brother tore strips off of me and my wife because she had posted on FB, three tribute posts to my mom. Very loving, very moving posts.\nI do not believe that I have been able to fully accept that I have lost my mom. I haven\u2019t been able to fully grieve her passing because it was so rudely interrupted by anger for what my father and brother were/are doing.\nWhen my mom passed away, I lost my father and brother as well.\nI pray that one day these wounds will heal and that the family bonds will be mended.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I have a great job making good money doing something interesting. I feel like I'm closed off from my emotions and have been for almost a decade since my mom died to the point where I struggle to even remember what it was like when she was around because it seems like my coping mechanism was to ignore it and almost pretend it never happened to the point where my first feeling when a family member tells a story with her in it is to feel annoyed that she's brought up. But I mean on the plus side I have never had any problem hanging out with friends and having fun, going out for beers and genuinely enjoying myself. I doubt any of my friends even noticed a difference as there really wasn't any change in me or how I acted.\n\nI've started working out recently and getting back into my hobbies which has been fun. Or at least I worked out once a week ago and have been thinking more about picking my hobbies back up but its hard when you have no real motivation to do much of anything because why put effort into doing anything that isn't right in front of me forcing me to deal with it, and I don't even know if I like them or have just been alright at them in the past and it's not like anything I would do with be good anyways. But I mean I still get up and brush my teeth and wash my face almost every day and take showers before I start to smell and will still have fun trying out new recipes and am motivated to go and hang out with friends so it's not like it's really that bad of a depression, it even feels weird to call it that because it feels like I'm just lazy.\n\nI've got a girlfriend that loves me and is amazing and we get along so well and have so many shared interests and it's just nice that I know I have her there for me. But I'm also so dissociated from emotions that I don't know if I even have the ability to love. My uncle that I was actually relatively close too passed away a few months ago and not a week later I had a coworker come by and offer their condolences and it took me a few seconds to even realize what she was talking about. I mean I'm not happy that he's gone at all he was a great person but I can't say that I feel sad either. Shit sometimes I feel like I'm so emotionally and even mentally cut off from anything outside of what is going on in the moment that if my dad or my brother were to die suddenly I'd probably be in to work by the end of the week if not the next day, and I'd probably only take the days off so I didn't seem weird to my coworkers or because I had an excuse to take a day off but I don't know if I'd feel sad or cry about it. I mean I do enjoy being around them and it wouldn't be fun to not be able to see them again but it's not like there is this love for them that I feel that would be heartbroken. They'd be gone and I'd move on.\n\nI feel like I have to fill every waking moment with some type of distraction be it a tv show, youtube video, reddit, video games, going out with friends, or something similar to avoid falling into anxiety. It's been so long that it is a bit of a subconscious mechanism so even when I try to delve into it it can be hard to. Yeah sometimes I'll dissociate to the point where nothing feels real and I feel like worthless trash that does nothing but the bare minimum to get by but those distractions work pretty well to help get past months like that\n\nSo yeah I mean not great but not unmanageable, most of the time I don't even think about any of it and feel fine. I've started talking to a therapist about it but there is so much to work through and only so much you can talk about in an hour and its hard to know if they even are a good fit.

I've gone through a lot of things without him, graduations, new jobs, new boyfriends - so I've got used to him not being there.

It made me feel guilty but I didn't want to dwell on it.\n\nThis last year has been trying. My mother was diagnosed with cancer last month and she will be starting chemotherapy soon.

Anything melancholy and haunting was right up our street, so when I saw a review that described Nick Cave's new album 'Ghosteen' as gorgeously haunting I was immediately intrigued. Ever since that first listen on Monday I haven't stopped crying or thinking about it. It's such a beautiful and bleak piece of work, possibly one of the most beautiful albums I've ever heard. You can really hear Cave processing and trying to come to terms with his son's death in every word he utters, and it's utterly heartbreaking. It's completely broke me. My dad really liked Nick Cave and he'll never hear this album, and I'll never get to text him or message him and say \"Have you heard Nick Cave's new album!? Why have I never listened to him before?!\"\n\nOn the one hand I'm so thankful for this album as I've been worried that I don't think or cry about my dad often enough. That I'm too wrapped up in my own life to miss him or think about him. It's helped me find a release I didn't know I needed.

The one family member I really see is my aunt, and we have practically nothing in common. I don't feel like I can talk to her about anything, and... I am close to my roommate, but she probably won't be in my life forever. I've never been in a relationship, because I rarely feel that kind of chemistry with someone; it has to come out of friendship for me, and... It's hard to meet people. Dating is hard, because it's so forced and awkward, and trying to develop an interest from the outset it like doing things backward for me.\n\nI work as a server, which is fine for now, but... My goal was always grad school. Even though I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with it, I thought I'd figure it out along the way, meet new people... Well, so far, it's been doing nothing but stressing me out. I feel like I don't know what I'm doing, and I feel like work and school is too much... In short, the feeling I've been getting is that it's not for me. I feel like I'm being lazy, but the trouble is that it's so hard to focus when I feel lost, and I just end up avoiding... I can do the work, and I can do it well, but I always end up freaking myself out over it, and I don't want to keep doing it. I just gave up my research assistant position because... Well, it's another case where I felt like I didn't have a whole lot of guidance on what I was doing, and... I thought I was doing ok with it, but I guess I wasn't keeping up, and now I feel like I did something wrong, like I cheated or something. That's what really triggered me today, and... Well, one factor that's making me feel like grad school really isn't for me (the other factor besides the stress is that I don't even know if I can afford it next semester).\n\nBut if not grad school... Then what? Not that there's anything wrong with being a server, but it's not really what I want to do with my life (and I don't know how long I can do it, anyway)... I like writing poetry; I'm in a group that meets once a month (although I've missed the past couple of meetings because of school). I like listening to music and dancing around and singing to myself and going to concerts (I've considered trying open mic, but that doesn't feel like something I can hold onto). I like taking long walks and daydreaming. What am I supposed to do with any of that? If I had something to hold onto, a career that felt like it was going somewhere, financial security, a partner I really loved,  *some* idea of a bright future I could work toward... That's what the idea of grad school was giving me, that's why I was ok with just poetry and music for a while, but if it's wrong for me... I feel like there's nothing for me but to daydream my life away, about things I can never actually have. I worry that I'm screwing up grad school for myself with all my worrying, and that later I'll realize that it *was* right for me. And then I feel like, I'm blaming myself too much: so many people are being screwed over in this world right now by circumstances they have no control over. But... that doesn't make me feel better. I try to believe that everything happens for a reason, even the bad stuff, but when it feels so random like that, it just makes me feel hopeless. And then it's so hard to even try. Like... I feel like I keep waiting for life to show me which direction to go, but I don't want to waste my life waiting. But now that I am trying to make something happen, I feel like I'm trying to force something that's not right, and I miss the time when I was able to wander around outside listening to music and daydreaming.

I am going to share the whole story so its going to be a decent read. So lets start from where the problems started happening.\n\nAbout 2 months ago my Dad's truck started breaking down (my dad is a truck driver and my mom doesn't work), he took out money from where ever he could for repairs but it kept breaking. Due to this my parents were forced to sell the house. My parents were old school, and I think the fact that my dad wasn't able to keep the mortgage on the house he felt that he failed as a man. I noticed that he was developing serious anxiety, and every little detail with the house sale (light fixture doesn't work, garage door gets stuck, etc) made him think the house would never be sold. The day i moved back to my college dorm room he even told me that he felt liquid floating around in his skull, i should have taken him way more seriously. My brother helped him quite a bit because he helped build houses and is very good with his hands (i was also away attending my last year of college) and my brother also helped sell any unnecessary furniture online so they can downsize and have some extra cash. The house had a buyer and it was going to close on the 30th of September.\n\nTwo weeks before the house was suppose to close (and literally on my birthday) i got a call from my dad, he said \" forgive me, forgive me.... but mom is dead\". I was in shock, i asked him what was going on over and over but the line was silent. I called my brother to ask him when the last time he saw our parents was, and if dad seemed connected to reality. He said he was going to call him and then get back to me. When he called me he said dad told him the same thing and he said he was driving over to the house right now. 20 Mins later, my brother's wife calls me and says that there are 5 cops cars outside the house, yellow tape everywhere, and even a helicopter in the air. I got in my car and drove two hours to figure out what was going on. On my drive back i got a call from the police station, they told me thats where my brother is and for me to come in too for some questions. It was at this point where i really began to believe that what i was fearing had happened - happened.\n\nFast forward past the questions, the police were able to tell me that my mom had serious head trauma and was in critical condition. When me and my brother got to the hospital, after about an hour or two of waiting, the lead doctor called us into a private room. He hold us that all of the injuries my mom sustained where above the shoulders, her brain was swelling to the point that it was trying to push into her spinal column. Also, he told us that when paramedics found my mom at the house, she was already not breathing for maybe 30 mins, She was without a doubt brain dead. I knew that there was no hope - the only thing that we were hoping for now was that her heart would stay beating long enough for our relatives to come from Poland and say their last goodbyes. They were suppose to come on Thursday, but sadly, my mom died on Wednesday at 8 am.\n\nI couldn't believe it. My father never touched my mom his entire life. He is the very reason she was able to quit her drinking problem. I thought that my dad would be able to get through his anxiety those last two weeks. After all the house was closing and my mom was there to reassure him. Two weeks... and they would have 200,000 grand in their pockets. I thought for sure they would be able to breathe, travel, visiting their family in Poland, and enjoy the end of their lives together ( my father was two years away from retirement). I'm lost, I never know everything could fall apart so quickly. What kills me the most is that my mother was the sweetest and most loving person I ever knew - even my friends would say that, she didn't deserve this.\n\nI don't know what is going to happen now. And everything feels like its been going at 100 miles per hour- with closing the house to planning the funeral, and getting Power of Attorney for my father so i can handle all of the finances. For the record I still love my father, my brother and I both do. We know that his actions were the result of a psychotic break. We both hope that he can be saved. I'm not sure how the legal process will play out exactly, but i hope that in time my brother and I can save my father, save him from his guilt, save him from himself. My father took care of me my entire life, made me into the man I am today, now its my turn to take care of him.\n\nI never been through anything like this. I don't know what i'm suppose to be feeling. Sometimes I feel sad, sometimes I feel tired, other times I feel anti social. I forget about it for a second sometimes when i'm playing basketball with my friends, and then it all comes back to me. The truth is I just want to tell my mom how much I love her, and how thankful I am of everything - and i want to hug my dad and tell him i love him, but i can't to either, and it kills.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

To understand my sleep issues, I have to tell you about the day she passed.\n\n\\*Warning for those who uh, sensitive. I have to be descriptive so get my point across\\*\n\nSo Friday morning, I get over to my grandmother's house. It's a day off for me because my aunt is home from work to look after grandma, but I try to go over there and feed her breakfast. My grandma was at the point in her life where food disgusted her and water had a 70/30 chance of being inhaled instead of ingested. She only ate for me. I felt if I failed her and didn't show up to attempt to feed her every day she would pass on quicker, which, I'll be honest, I did not want ( I was extremely selfish, I loved my grandma) Anyway, I get to her house at 9 am. My aunt runs out crying. I'm like oh god, thinking the worst. She explains whats happened with grandma. I run in and see. Grandma is alive and eyes are open, eyes are fixed looking to the wall, reactive though, and she's not blinking. I'm not sure how long she was like that but I could literally see cat hairs stuck to her eyeballs. She's not talking or acting like she comprehends anything. She was also breathing weird. I suppose some people would call it active death, but I wasn't.. expecting that, no schooling I've had, no chit chats with drs, nurses, what have you could have prepared me for that. She was just starring. It was so terrifying. She was like that for four hours until a nurse came out and told us to administer pain meds and Ativan. She eventually fell asleep and then 5 hours later she passed. It took 2 more additional hours for a nurse to come and call time. 2 more hours AFTER for the funeral home to pick up her body. That in itself was stressful. I didn't want to leave the room, even after she passed. So I sat there for hours with her body making sure.. idk. She wasn't coming back, and if she did, I wanted to be there. I know.. it sounds crazy.\n\nMy issue is that every night since that day, every time I try to sleep be it a nap, or for the night, I see my grandmother's open eyes, not blinking face. It overpowers a pretty significant dose of Ativan, in which I lay there for 4-5 hours before passing out. It'll take me a little while to get back onto medical (I lost it when grandma passed, she was my full time job and benefits, I do have an appointment for next week but there's a good chance my medical is already shut off) I'm almost out of Ativan, and I'm just.. not sure what to do. Does the image that's burned into my head go away in time?

I find myself feeling horrible at times about it. To be more specific, I feel horrible about myself and hopeless about my ambitions. His death changed everything. I do not have good self esteem. I have trouble making new friends. I am in a new relationship with a good person, but I am unhappy with myself and my life. I suppose I am seeking some support and guidance about what I should do. I am a student with no health coverage (only part time at the moment). I don't want to ruin my new relationship by depending too much on my partner for reassurance and support (my partner is also in school and working). I have one good friend who has a new child. She has been an amazing source of support, but I don't want to exhaust her with my emotions and neediness. Of course, support is reciprocated for those I care about. I always pay my own way if we eat out, I don't call them unessecsarily, and I do try to listen and to support them as well. I want to be a good person, excellent employee, a dependable, and overall happy. Sometimes I just can't seem to do it. I want to crawl back into bed and hide from the world. This last year I have been a wreck. \n\nHow do you cope with grief?\nHow do you cope with intense feelings of worthlessness? \n\nSometimes I am angry about everything that has happened.

When I was a baby, my father died, and I don't remember him. My grandmother died when I was four or five years old- I'd seen her every day until she was hospitalized, and then we spent every weekend for the greater part of a year in the hospital in the nearest city visiting her, going often on weeknights too. My grandfather finally lost his struggle with Alzheimer's when I was ten- he'd been in the nursing home for about a year prior because my single mother couldn't give him the around the clock supervision he'd come to need at home, but we visited him at least weekly. When he was in the hospital for a fall, I somehow knew it was different than before when I was in the ER waiting room and my mom was in his room. I called my grandpa and told him what was going on, anticipating his death, and he hurried over and arrived just a few minutes before we were pulled into the quiet room.\n\nEven though all of these are at the least nearly a decade old, it still feels like they impact me. I've found a great discomfort with being in hospitals. I can't have conversations about dementia or Alzheimer's because I'll start crying, and I can't go into a nursing home without having a panic attack even though my grandfather and I were never close (he had had Alzheimer's my whole life which made it difficult for me to bond with him). I can't speak about my father or hear people talk about him without breaking down into sobs, even though I have no memory of him because I wasn't even a year old when he passed. \n\nThe most difficult part though is how my mind will kind of enter itself back into fresh grief. Vivid scenarios of people I care about dying seem to be able to crawl into my head, and it plays out how I find out and how I respond, but it's almost entirely immersing- I can start to tremble and cry, and my body responds as if these people are actually dying and it needs to initiate the grief process. Even though it's entirely fantasy, it's hard for me to pull myself out of it and to remind myself that it's not actually happening, because it feels like it's happening. The best thing I can compare it to is how sometimes panic attacks can happen in response to the scenarios someone imagines as their anxiety spirals out of control- it's like that, but instead of it being with anxiety, it's with grief.\n\nMost days I'm fine, but there are other days where I'm really not, especially if something is around that reminds me of these situations that can spark the sort of grief-spiral to go off.

I made a Reddit account just to be able to get this off of my chest. Okay so here it goes, I living with my grandparents basically my entire life. It started just staying with them on the weekends and turned into me moving in. The winter after I graduated high school my grandpa passed and there\u2019s guilt there for being so absent during that time. But the heavy guilt is with the death of my grandma. She had ovarian cancer. She had it before and it went in to remission. It came back and was worse. I got my cna so that I could better help her. The night she died nothing felt right. I left class early and she was sleeping. She didn\u2019t wake up when I came in. I gave her a little shake and told her I was home. She woke up a little and I asked her if she needed anything. She said no and fell back asleep. I heard it. I know the second I heard it what it was. It was the death rattle. I refused to believe it. I kept telling myself in the morning when we go to her chemo appointment I\u2019d have the nurses help me to get her back to normal. Make her better again. I went to bed planning what I would do, how I would get everything to make this as easy as possible to get her back to her old self. I woke up shortly after to the sound of her puking. I just sat there for a minute. I thought it was just her getting sick and I would check on her when she was done and make sure she had water and everything she needed. But it didn\u2019t stop. It just kept going. When I checked on her I could see from the tv light that her chin was wet. I thought she got sick on herself and I\u2019d just clean her up. No big deal. I turned on her bedroom light and saw that was more like chocolate mousse all over her. I think it blood. I called 911 and they told me to get her on the floor and to preform cpr. I did but all I did was push more of the blood out of her mouth. She died. They couldn\u2019t get her to breath on her own. I always wonder if I had gotten to her sooner, or if i had maybe done something that night would she be here? I miss her so much and the guilt I feel is so overwhelming. It gets to the point of me wishing I would pass. Then the guilt would end and I would be with her again. I\u2019ve been in therapy and it\u2019s just not worked. I won\u2019t harm myself, don\u2019t worry. I just get so overwhelmed with all of this that it feels like there\u2019s no way out.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

She was sobbing and clearly grief stricken, I could hear the breaks in her voice and her tone; she was completely distraught.\n\nI don\u2019t know the exact circumstances under which my aunt passed away. I know she had some disease with her bone marrow, and she had been sick for a while.

They didn\u2019t pick me up because I\u2019m still at university, but I feel like I shouldn\u2019t go out or do anything because of her death. I feel like I should feel guilty for doing so earlier.

I found out I was pregnant about a year ago now, I had two kids already and we didn\u2019t plan on having anymore but it happened. I was worried and overwhelmed at first which then turned into elation as my stomach grew. \n\nMy first pregnancy I had horrible preeclampsia to where me and my son almost died (my second pregnancy was perfect) but because of my first I was always terrified it would happen again. So I went to check ups regularly along with calling my doctor if I felt anything was off. So it was a pretty big shock to me when I went to labor and delivery because I thought I was going into labor only for them to to tell me she was gone, there was no heart beat. \n\nOn July 22nd I went in expecting to stay, expecting to have my beautiful daughter. My fianc\u00e9, my son and my daughter were waiting in the car and I would call them if I was going into labor and he would bring the kids to his moms until we were ready to come home. I went in and told them I was having contractions and they put me in a room. They put a heartbeat monitor on my stomach and kept moving it around trying to find the heart beat. The nurse said she couldn\u2019t tell if the heartbeat was mine or the babies and she would be right back. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t come back. Instead a doctor introduces herself to me and brings in an ultrasound machine. \u201cLet\u2019s find this heartbeat\u201d she says with a smile. Not even a minute later she asks me if I\u2019ve felt the baby kick recently and if I\u2019ve had any problems with this pregnancy. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it couldn\u2019t of been too long ago that I did, and just extremely low iron.\u201d I say as I start to slowly panic inside my head. \u201cIs there something wrong with her heart\u201d, \u201cwill I have to have an emergency C section\u201d, \u201cwhat do they do if there\u2019s an emergency with the baby while she\u2019s still inside me\u201d all thoughts racing through my head. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, there\u2019s no heartbeat.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m just frozen. This isn\u2019t real, I\u2019m watching a movie. I think I\u2019m in shock when I finally just lose it. She brings in another doctor to confirm and they try to console me. I was only a few days away from my due date. Everyone I love is waiting in the car thinking their loved one will be here soon. A whole room inside my house is perfectly crafted for my beautiful daughter. This can\u2019t be happening to me. Then they tell me I can give birth now or wait until the morning. I chose to wait. I know it must sound weird but I wanted to spend more time with her. \n\nOn July 23rd at 6:50 pm Harper Margaret Nilsen was born. She looked just like her sister with her button nose. The only thing that stood out was that she had beautiful black hair. And a lot of it. Both of my other children have got the blonde hair from their dads and were bald when they were born. But she had my hair and a lot of it. I got almost a whole day with her. To hold her and kiss her. And then we had to say our goodbyes and put her to rest. \n\nI had to explain to my 8 year old that his sister wasn\u2019t coming anymore. I had to be strong for them, they needed me. I think for the longest time I was in shock. I didn\u2019t cry much and felt a weird normal almost, sensation. Then about a week ago this overwhelming grief just smacked me in the face. I don\u2019t know how to move on with out something my body made. My body doesn\u2019t know how to move on. I just want my daughter back. \n\nI feel like everyone has moved on besides me. I\u2019m just stuck in this place between hell and reality or maybe they\u2019re the same thing. Why me? Why her and not me? I would give up everything just to see her take a breath. Take her first step, say mom for the first time. It\u2019s like I\u2019m watching a movie and it\u2019s happening to someone else. I know it\u2019s real I know she\u2019s gone but the more days that past the more I just don\u2019t want to believe it happened. But the more I\u2019m reminded it did happen. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t know why I posted this here. Maybe I want to vent to strangers because I feel like nothing else is helping and I don\u2019t wanna burden other people with my troubles.

He got very sick very quickly and passed away 2 weeks after. He was in his early twenties and was the star of the family, a special child that everyone loved and cared for. Though he was older than me, we grew up together and I always looked out for him. He lived 3 blocks away and would regularly come visit us, either to steal my chocolates or with some new funny stories about his mischiefs, until I moved overseas for higher education and only saw him once a year. Everyone was devastated when it happened, and having to leave them and fly back overseas for my exams made it worse. \n\nThe last I saw him was during my holiday visit earlier that same year, when for the first time ever, he cried at seeing me leave. He literally cried for 2 hours before I left and it was quite shocking as I had never seen him cry before, and it didn't make any sense. It was like he had an intuition that it would be the last time we meet and he kept asking me to stay longer, which I couldn\u2019t and regret to this day.\n\nAfter he passed away and I came back home, my mind was constantly preoccupied by his thoughts and how I couldn't meet him one last time. He'd slipped into a coma by the time I flew back to the country. It's selfish I know, but I wish he had hold on just a day longer and I would\u2019ve been able to tell him how much I loved him. Anyway, for days I couldn\u2019t sleep or focus, and even failed my exams. Until one day watching the only video I had of him on loop, I dosed off and dreamt of him for the first time (or the only time I actually remember), and it is still as clear in my memory as it was when I had it. \n\nHe was in his parent\u2019s boutique, on the couch he generally used to hang out at, and no one else was around. I entered and was super shocked as couldn\u2019t comprehend what I was seeing. He looked at me and asked me how I was, in the same words and tone he always used to. Before I could even open my mouth, he said, \n\u201cDrunkDiva, I\u2019m fine. Stop worrying. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\nI screamed for my mom and my aunt (his mum) to come to the boutique as it\u2019s connected to their home, and see who\u2019s here. As I screamed he started to fade away, I tried to stop him, but as they came in he was gone and suddenly I woke up scared. Nothing made sense for a minute but I felt an extremely weird warmth and started to cry. \nI\u2019ve never before believed in spirits or supernatural or anything as such, and I probably had the dream as I was thinking about him before I dosed off, but that day for a moment, it gave me peace to believe that he came to visit me. He came to tell me he was okay. It still hurts to have lost him but I guess in that moment, I got a sense of closure.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

In Australia we graduate in year 12. I had known this guy since year 10 because he was my engineering and mechatronics teacher. In year 11 he was my woodwork teacher, and the same in year 12. My woodwork class also just happened to be my mentor class. In my school your mentor class is like your home base. If there is a school event, you do it with your mentor class. So anyway, this guy was my mentor teacher in year 11 and 12. I have probably had more classes with him than any other teacher throughout my schooling life and he was just such a good person. He had this laid back friendly aura about him. He seemed to have a zest for life and his positivity just radiated and made other people feel happy. He was always full of advice and just seemed totally different than a lot of my other teachers. His daughter also went to my school and was in my mentor class for year 11 and the first half of year 12. She dropped out of school because she couldn't handle the anxiety of the exams, with her father's full support. He loved her so much, he would always talk about her and show me what she was doing with her new job after she left. \n\nThe last time I saw him was during graduation and I don't remember what I said to him, but I knew graduation was probably the last time I would ever see 80% of the people I ever knew from my school (students or teachers), so I remember being very philosophical about the fact it was the last time I would see most of these people for the rest of my life. I hope I said something with some amount of substance. \n\nMy mum told me around lunch time today that she had some bad news from my school (my little brother attends so she still gets emails about what's going on), and she told me that Mr B had died from cancer. \n\nI didn't even know he was sick. I hadn't spoken to or heard from him or his daughter for 2 years. He died on Wednesday, so I found out 5 days after it happened. When I woke up this morning, he was alive as far as I knew. Last Wednesday I was doing a photography project with my friends and we had a few drinks and smoked some weed and had a really good night. Meanwhile his daughter would have been having one of the worst times of her entire life. I messaged her a few hours after I found out saying that it had been a long time and I was so sorry to hear about her dad, and I was here if she wanted to talk about it. I'm sure she has closer friends she would much rather talk to, but I still felt I had to message her and just say I'm sorry for what happened. \n\nI haven't had to grieve many people before. I had to grieve my grandfather who lived in Canada when I was 12, I had to grieve my grandfather who lived in my town when I was 15, I grieved for my cat who was attacked by dogs and died in my arms when I was 17. (Obviously grieving grandparents is harder than grieving a cat, but it still hurt). I had to grieve the death of an older friend I knew when I was 15, who recently had two children and died way too young from an aggressive cancer earlier this year, (I'm 19).\n\nWhen I heard the news about my teacher I felt my heart start to beat faster and I felt a sense of dissociation. I have been spending all day just thinking about him while in my garden, and talking about him with my mother when I am inside. I generally don't cry on the first day of finding these things out, it usually takes longer than that for it to hit me I guess, but talking about it kinda made it all come at once. My mother really liked him too (she had met him during parent teacher interviews. He would always tick the box saying he recommended an interview even though nothing was wrong because he just wanted to talk with the parents during the parent teacher meetings!) I cried in her arms tonight and I think she cried too. \n\nIt's kind of weird because whether he was dead or alive, I was not likely to ever see him again either way. I have since bumped into old teachers at pubs and such, so maybe I would have, but I will probably never encounter most of the teachers I have ever had. I feel weird to be so sad about someone I haven't seen in so long. He was just such a good person that no matter how long it has been, his death would always hurt. \n\nRest in peace Mr B. You were not only one of the best teachers I ever knew, but simply one of the best people I ever knew, and I'm truly honored to have had the time with you that I did.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I witnessed my dad accidentally run over one of our dogs. A couple years later, another one of our dogs \"cricket\" got ran over because he didn't see the trailer behind this pickup. Ever since those events have happened, I've felt like death has always followed me. Afterwards, my dad got sick with cancer and passed away when I was 11. It feels like his death has been a void on my heart that I haven't allowed to heal yet. He was the best. He would let me play Doom and Wolfenstein on his computer. We would watch movies together, play xbox, watch T.V. shows together, travel to visit family, and more. His affection for me seemed to be endless. Anytime I played sports he was beaming in the stands with a proud look on his face. I wish I had more time with him. When I was 19, I had a friend unexpectedly pass away. A clot passed through his heart and he never woke up. I had known him since I was 7. He was such a gentle person and the life of the party. A couple months later, a close friend of mine had committed suicide. It was shocking and I've felt kind of numb to it. When I was 21, my very best friend visited my home town for the very last time. He was one of my Day 1s. After he went back to Lawrence, he committed suicide as well. That was very devastating on me. I feel guilty for not talking to him more, or checking in on him, or not noticing little verbal queues. A couple months ago a buddy of mine came to our property to hang out with us. He wanted to go on a walk. I didn't feel like going as I've been battling depression and substance abuse for awhile. He never came back. Turns out, he went onto the highway and a driver killed him in a hit and run. The driver was never found. I'm not sure why I'm still here sometimes and I feel guilty for still being here. Somedays I feel like are too much, but I go through it one day at a time. I've decided to sober up, not running away or escaping from issues anymore. I'm 91 days sober, but these losses have scarred my soul and I'm not sure if they will ever heal.\n\n\\- Ethan", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My dad was an alcoholic and was abusive to my mom. He got sober right after their divorce. Until I was 9, my sibling and I spent many weekends with my dad. He struggled financially so we mostly walked to local parks and beaches and hung out at his apartment drawing and making up stories. I have a lot of fond memories of this time. \n\nWhen I was 9, we moved across the country. My dad called my sibling and I a lot, sent cards, etc. We visited him one summer when I was 11 and had a great time. That was the last time I ever saw him. Both of my parents didn\u2019t have a lot of money, plus my mom still had anger towards him for his past behavior. Over all those years, my dad and I still maintained a relationship through regular phone calls, cards and letters. \n\nI\u2019m now 31. My dad\u2019s health had been declining over the last few years and last week I got a phone call from his nurse in the hospital. He had cancer that had spread aggressively and wasn\u2019t going to make it. He has no family and was there alone. I decided to fly to see him in his final days. I spent Friday, Saturday, and Sunday (all night until Monday morning) with him at the hospital. He was unresponsive the majority of the time. At one point he managed to squeeze my hand back when I held his which made me feel a lot better. I talked to him even though he couldn\u2019t respond, told him I loved him, and that I have no hard feelings for him not being around all these years. I told him I would miss his phone calls. Every time I left the hospital, I told him I would be back soon. On Monday morning, I had to fly back to get back to work. I kissed him on the forehead and told him that I love him, and I would be sad but I would be okay. I left for the airport, and about an hour later received a phone call that he had passed away peacefully.\n\nI\u2019m struggling with so much right now. I\u2019m so sad thinking of the years we never saw each other. Over the last few years my financial situation improved and I could have gone to see him but I didn\u2019t.

I lost my 12 1/2 year old German shepherd, Zilla this past January to her failing health and lymphoma. She was my childhood dog. My parents got her from a questionable breeder when I was in kindergarten (and too young to understand/protest buying a purebred dog). I watched her suffer her entire life from countless health issues such as lupus, panus, hip dysplasia, overextended wrists/ankles, profuse nosebleeds from lupus complications that formed deep cracks in her nose, etc. My family doesnt know when she had developed Lymphoma but it suddenly took a turn for the worse in October 2018 when her ability to walk dramatically dropped. We thought it was just degenerative myelopathy at first but over the next few months it became very clear that she was dying. My family and I all carried her around the house in a sling, cooked her special gourmet meals to convince her to eat, and spent every waking minute with her. A few days before Christmas our vet broke the news that she likely had cancer. We spoonfed her and made sure she was comfortable until the end. She died the second week of January after a long night of staying up watching her. I watched her die in my arms. I'm so happy she passed away peacefully at home with her family around her but it was the first time I had ever witnessed a \"natural death\" and it was absolutely horrific to watch. I had seen a previous dog be put down at a vet when I was around 12. To this day I can't unsee Zilla laying on the floor dead behind the eyes but her chest still violently heaving and gasping for air while I couldn't do anything but sit and watch. I miss her so much. Even before her health took a turn, for a year or so before I had started having frequent nightmares about losing her and my senior cat. I still have nightmares very often about them being sick or dying. My senior cat Leo is 18 and I know that he could live another year or another five years but I cannot shake the fear of watching him die like Zilla did. He is perfectly healthy besides the dozen kidney stones hes had for a long time that the vet says are likely too big to pass (and being a little on the chonky side). I'm just so scared all the time and the thought of losing him sends me into a snotty blubbering ocean of tears. I have a 6 yr old FIV+ cat named Sinbad and while he's perfectly healthy and even with FIV he will likely still live a full life, I'm very scared that he may become sick to the point that his weakened immune system wont be able to fight it off and he might be robbed of the 15-20 years he deserves. I try to spend as much time as I can with Leo and Sinbad, but I can never overcome this fear I have. I know worrying a little is normal for a pet owner or anyone with another living being in their care but the number of horrible dreams and nights spent crying hasn't let up. I know I should discuss this with my therapist and talk about my constant anxiety but it never seems to come up and I'm afraid of crying in front of her which is something I've never done before. Has anyone else had experiences with severe anxiety over pet loss or loss in general?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Do not feel guilty for needing breaks. \n\nBe wary of people who tell you that you need to dwell on your feelings and live in darkness in order to \"work through\" grief. There's actually not much evidence for the idea of grief work at all. My favorite quote from George Bonnano (grief researcher) is \"if you think you're doing okay, you're doing okay.\" If someone tells you you're not grieving enough, politely tell them they don't know what they're talking about.

He went into a coma and as I held his hand and told him that I loved him, he built up the energy to squeeze my hand which usually never happens when someone is in a coma.

Of course, this has also become a problem at school. I literally can not get the thought of him dying out of my head. I get to the verge of tears in class and I really can\u2019t focus. All I want to do is curl up into a fetal position and just cry, but no one would understand. I\u2019m falling extremely behind on schoolwork and am constantly lying to people. I hate this so much.

She was 80 years old and she has been married to my grandad 61 years. They have 4 sons, 10 grandchildren, and 4 great grandchildren. My nannan is the centre of my family, we all adore her to pieces. She\u2019s stubborn and in her head she\u2019s still 20, she\u2019s hilarious and inappropriate and daft and has us all roaring with laughter. She was a singer for a career, her and my grandad travelled. They have so many stories, and even though she\u2019s a bit daft and you\u2019ve heard it 10 times before it still makes you smile every single time. Like the time she accidentally knocked out a robber in Barcelona with a bottle of whisky, and the local police force gave her a heroes welcome and she was known as \u2018wonderwoman\u2019 to the locals for the remainder of her holiday. Stuff like this seemed to follow my nannan round, she would always end up the centre of attention but she loved to entertain. Even in the past couple of years with her mobility deteriorating and arthritis crippling her fingers, she still has 10+ of our family round to hers for a Sunday dinner. She never gave up on me and encouraged me to go for it, when nobody else it. A few months ago I was living abroad about to be deported and stressing, she said on the phone to me \u2018Our Georgia, you\u2019re my double you do not need to ever worry. If you were to fall off the roof of the city hall, you would fall straight into a fur coat!\u2019\n\nHer downfall was her stubbornness- she was too proud to be seen with her walking stick, and by the time she came to terms with that she needed a wheelchair. She had a fall in farmfoods and broke her hip- she was adamant that we told everyone it happened in Marks and Spencer instead, everything must be 5 star for my nannan! They operated and her mobility was fine, then she got pneumonia and beat it. She came out the hospital for one day, then got taken straight back in by paramedics because her oxygen was so low. She hated the hospital- at 80 years, this was the only time she had been in one aside from giving birth. The person my nannan was had gone- she was miserable. She obsessed over the dignitas clinic in Switzerland and told us all that she wanted to die, she lived a full life and how she was now, in hospital weeks on end strapped up to oxygen, was no way to live. She asked all of my family questions about how our other relatives and friends died. It had become an obsession for her, all she could think about.\n\nHer oxygen levels came back up and she was due to come out of hospital today. I saw her 2 days ago- she wasn\u2019t happy but health wise, she was good, they were keeping her in one more day for observation. Before releasing her, they sent my nannan down for a neurological test- she has had unresolved problems with her throat and eating for a couple of years now which is when she started deteriorating and losing a lot of weight. The test lasted an hour, she fell asleep and just never woke up. When they tried to bring her round, her oxygen was so low she was at a point of no recovery. They turned off the monitor because the beeping of the oxygen decline was too difficult to listen to. I really think she gave up. \n\nWhat has happened is a huge shock for my whole family. My Nannan is the glue that holds us together, and she is such a gigantic personality. She died at 1am, and I\u2019m writing this at 8am. It feels like time has stopped. We saw each other nearly every day, if not we would speak on the phone. All of my family adore my nannan and she is so close with us all, she used to say that I am her double. She really was my best friend. \n\nWhen my other Nannan died after a long illness three years ago, my nannan came over with a crate of Sauvignon Blanc and stayed up with me all night watching her shitty television. She loved her TV and rubbish documentaries on Channel 5, then feeding back this information to anyone who\u2019d listen to her. She had probably exaggerated the majority of it, but it was funny how daft she was. There was a couple of weeks where she saw something on the TV and got fascinated with sex robots and this was a conversation starter for her. I digress- last night me and my mum stayed up late drinking our best 5 star wine, watching shitty TV (something like celebrity botched plastic surgery) and half laughing half crying at my nannans stories. This was while my Dad, his brothers and my Grandad sat with my nannan in hospital waiting for her to pass- the hospital told us in the evening she wouldn\u2019t make it through the night, so we had a couple of hours to prepare for the worst.\n\nThis morning I can\u2019t believe this is real and it\u2019s happened. I am glad that she didn\u2019t suffer and her death wasn\u2019t prolonged and painful (I went through this with my other nannan and I couldn\u2019t go through that again), and I can appreciate she didn\u2019t want to be here, but this was so before her time. \n\nI\u2019m going to go check on my parents now, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m looking for advice here I just needed to write this down to try and stop myself feeling so numb. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do. Probably carry on drinking expensive wine, and give my nannan the most 5 star funeral our city has ever seen.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My woman isn't dead, but I feel like she is. I was an over the road truck driver and I went on the road for 2 months and when I was 30 minutes from home, she sent me a message saying she had moved out and it was over. I didn't even get to see her again face to face. I struggled being away for so long and was saving money to be able to support her and her son and be home a lot more often. \n\nWe were an epic couple before that. She was perfect for me and she constantly said I was perfect for her. We met when I was dealing with the loss of an abusive ex and she helped me through it and showed me what a real relationship was like when two people loved each other as equals and not subordinates. \n\nI'm at a loss to deal with this. The day I got her message, I was angry and acted like it didn't matter but every single day the pain grows exponentially and has become unbearable. I discovered she was cheating on me the past couple of months and moved in with him. She has cut off all communication and after talking every day all day for over 3 years, I'm having a hell of a time being used to not hearing from her. I have considered suicide several times but it would destroy friends and family who don't deserve that. \n\nThe hardest part is thinking that this is completely out of character for her. Some of the things she said didn't sound like her, but I have friends who still talk to her and she is just as cruel about me to them. I didn't treat her badly, I supported her and her son, I loved her although I admit to being aloof at times because I didn't want to smother her with my real feelings...I'm at a loss to explain why she appears to hate me now. For instance, when I said I'd rather be dead than lose her she said, \"You can't do that. Everyone would blame me if you did.\" The more I think about it, the more it seems that she was more worried about being blamed than me being dead. :( \n\nI've tried meeting other women, have plenty of female friends who would love to be my next girlfriend but they're not her so it's a complete nonstarter for me. \n\nI'm not sure what my point here is. I don't have a question...but just wanted to vent and have a place to say how much I love and miss my Lena. \n\nFriends have wondered why TF I'd want her back since she cheated and obviously doesn't give a damn about me now. I don't know the answer to that. I'm a fairly intelligent man, but I can't explain why the hell my heart won't let her go. She's my soulmate, and you don't find those very often. I've only found one, and I'm 48 so...it's hard to let this one go. We fit like two perfect puzzle pieces...I've been searching for her my whole life. So why did she do this?

He underwent surgery, there were complications and he never recovered.\n\nI\u2019m currently 27 and work as a doctoral researcher. My supervisor is basically the nicest boss imaginable.\n\nSince the diagnosis, I haven\u2019t been able to properly focus on work. I have done some \u201csimple\u201d stuff that doesn\u2019t require a lot of mental work and already found that quite exhausting, but currently my main task is to write a paper about our findings, which, well, doesn\u2019t go very well, since it requires more concentration than I can manage. As a consequence of this, work has turned from something I reasonably enjoy to something that severely frustrates me over the past few months.\n\nWhen he heard about my loss, my supervisor told me to take all the time I needed. I spent away two weeks straight after his death (and one week before when it was clear it was inevitable) and then returned, but haven\u2019t managed to get any real work done since then.\n\nAnyway, this week, a particularly nasty wave of grief hit me, ending up with me staying at home on Wednesday without calling in and only catching up on that on Thursday. I told him I had caught a cold, which wasn\u2019t a lie since I did have cold symptoms, but it wasn\u2019t exactly the entire truth, either. I know this was unprofessional, but I entirely lacked the energy to do anything that day.\n\nToday he pulled me aside to tell me that what I had done on Wednesday was not okay and that he generally felt I would have to pick up the pace again if I wanted to finish my PhD successfully. As I mentioned, he\u2019s the nicest boss imaginable, so he went on to explain that basically his main complaint was my lack of communication, which I think is fair enough, and asked me if there was any way he (or others) could help.\n\nI think the solution here is to write him a letter, explaining very openly the thoughts and problems I currently have. I don\u2019t currently feel strong enough for an eye-to-eye conversation on the topic. If someone disagrees, please let me know though.\n\nHowever, my main concern is that he is right about me dropping the ball. And I\u2019m not sure what to do about it. I\u2019m currently stuck in this vicious cycle of feeling bad about my performance, doubting my own skills and ending up doing actually worse.\n\nDo you guys know how to manage to get back on track? Does something like breaking down this overwhelming task into several small ones and writing manageable to-do-lists help?

I feel like I\u2019m going to explode.. trigger warning for suicide. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn late August, I got a call at 2am from my younger sister (24) about her bf (32). My husband and I, and my sister and her boyfriend were all extremely close. We did everything together. Literally trips and visits, moving houses, etc. Anyways, sister calls asking if I\u2019d heard from her bf because they\u2019d had a really big fight and she\u2019d left the house to go to her apartment. He\u2019d apparently called his sister and told her he loved her and a bunch of things she couldn\u2019t understand so she had called my sister. It sounded like a goodbye and everyone is panicking. My sister gets into her car and is speeding trying to get to the house but.. it\u2019s too late. He\u2019s already gone. He\u2019d hung himself and she couldn\u2019t cut him down so she\u2019d grabbed his roommates (who had no idea what was going on) and they all cut him down and tried to  resuscitate him.. I can\u2019t even imagine the image of that just circling my sisters brain.. he was literally like a brother to me and I was she\u2019ll-shocked. I can\u2019t even imagine her pain...She seemed to be distracting herself but I insisted on going up to visit her (4 hr drive from me). My husband and I tried not to bring anything up because she\u2019s a very closed off person. We had some Chinese takeout and watched a new anime. Just kind of..hung out with her. I knew her dad (one of my step dads) was coming the next morning to be with her so I thought it was okay for us to leave. I\u2019ve never, never regretted a decision so much in my damn life. Her dad did come, they also had takeout and watched movies, had a few laughs. And then he left. The next day was supposed to be her friends\u2019 turn but she told them I was still there. When I wasn\u2019t. I was on vacation with the entire rest of my family because it had already been paid for. Though the entire time, I was desperately trying to convince her to pack some clothes so I could go get her to be with me. But the point is, she lied to her friends. Pushed me away like I was overreacting. The next day, same thing. Lies, pushing everyone away even though she was clearly getting more and more closed off, and by the morning after that, she was gone too.. Went the same way her bf did.. I\u2019m having such a hard time between disbelief and intense anguish.. This can\u2019t be real but it has to be because it hurts so much. She was literally my person. My best friend. I don\u2019t have anyone else like her in my life. No one I shared every interest with. No one I can send stupid jokes too and they find it funny too. I have my husband but it isn\u2019t the same you know? We share some interests but others bother him, especially now. (I\u2019m a true crime junkie).. I don\u2019t know how to help him heal either. He has cried once in ten years that I have seen\u2014When I was in labor and couldn\u2019t handle the pain. But he can\u2019t even look at their pictures without breaking down in tears. I had to move them to a different room. I don\u2019t know how to deal with the loss of my friend and my sister together. I don\u2019t know how to help my husband process this either. I just feel like part of me is missing. Everyone is overly worried about me now too because as my husband put it \u201cif there were a pecking order for these things, you\u2019d be next on the list..\u201d. I don\u2019t disagree but I can\u2019t even fathom causing anyone else pain like this. But still, I get calls from my grandmother once a day now. The first two weeks, my husband wouldn\u2019t let me close the door to shower. They\u2019re all so worried and I get it but I find it irritating. Why would I ever inflict this much pain on anyone else?.. I\u2019m just wrestling with everything associated with these losses and family drama and I just don\u2019t know if I\u2019m actually handling it well enough or just pushing it down so it doesn\u2019t hurt as much. \n\nI just really needed to get this out I guess.

I know everyone deals with grief differently.   I was in seeking counseling through a program through work, but I had a limited amount of sessions and I am not sure how much my insurance will cover. I really like the lady that I am working with. \n\nI've lost four family members in the last year. Three were within a few months of each other.  One Aunt died of a terminal illness, my niece was born prematurely and passed away, another Aunt was in a serious car accident and passed away from her injuries and my uncle passed unexpectedly while away on a trip.  To give a little context, the aunt that was in the car accident I was not super close to but I held her hand until she passed away. It was my first time actually being in the room when someone had passed, let alone holding their hand.  It is coming up on a few on the anniversaries and I have started to have horrendous nightmares of family members dying unexpectedly. The one I had last night shook me a little because in my dream I woke up and told my family that two family members had passed, but they really had still passed and it was another dream.  And the Aunt that was in the car accident was there and telling me everything is okay. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo to sum it up, I am coming up on the anniversary of a few family members' passing and I am having horrendous nightmares.

This person had been my partner's best friend for 16+ years (we are both in our mid-late 20's), through moves to new countries, across oceans, through everything. They messaged each other something between weekly and daily, they were extremely close. We found out about this loss by this person's sister reaching out to my partner with a brief Facebook message 2 days after this person's death. We have received no information other than \"Their struggling is over, they can finally be at peace\". We asked if there will be a memorial service we could attend or if this person's sister would be willing to talk a little more about it/this person with us. We were informed that the funeral had happened before we were informed of this person's death, and the sister needs more time before they are ready to talk (which is completely reasonable for the sister to feel).\n\nI/we have so many questions.\n\n- How do we find closure? \n\nWe found out about her death so suddenly and it doesn't feel real to either of us. We both felt like it was a scam or prank at first. My partner had just spoken with this person 10 days ago... We can't go to a funeral, talk with other people about this person, hear stories, get some details... This person's Facebook has not even been converted to a \"memorial\" page or whatever yet, no has anyone commented on it about their death... we would go there to try to talk to  people, to ask questions, but it seems inappropriate to break this news on the internet. We can't find an obituary of any sort on the internet either.\n\n\n- How do i support my partner?\n\nI knew this person for a few years, my partner has known and maintained close contact with this person since elementary school. My heart breaks every time i look at my partner because i can't imagine how hard this is hitting her. I haven't maintained any friendships nearly that long and don't have any friends that are remotely that close. I have just been listening to my partner and expressing my own feelings of loss to her. I wanted to know my partner's best friend way better and now that isn't possible. This pales in comparison to what she must be feeling. I want to be there for my partner but I can't help but feel this loss is too monumental for me to be able to say or do anything to help. In between the cry-sessions, we have just been trying to distract ourselves and stay busy the last two days.\n\n- Who can we/my partner talk to?\n\nWe both have therapists that we can vent to, but something seems completely inadequate about that. We want details, we want stories from other people about this person, we want to know if there was a note. We want to know more to prove to ourselves that this is real. This person lived in Europe and we are in The U.S. It is not really feasible to just show up and start asking questions. Do we just have to wait for this news to break on Facebook/Instagram? Do we just have to wait for this person's sister to heal enough to talk to us? \n\n- How do we not feel like every other problem in the world is irrelevant and inconsequential?\n\nWe both are feeling very down. We had been making plans to relocate closer both to this person and my partner's family in the next 1-2 years in addition to making some career changes. All of those plans feel like they belong in the trash now. \n\n\nAny thoughts would be greatly appreciated.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I've made the assumption before it was because he had a lot of trouble loving himself. Learning more and more about him, I was probably right. I usually give funny birthday cards to friends and family, but for him I always made an effort to find a card that had just the right message he needed to read. He needed to be reminded that he is loved for just the way he was.\n\nI found the perfect card for him last year. He was a devout Catholic (the good kind) and it was a quote from Pope Francis. Unfortunately I was in the process of moving and it got lost among the chaos of boxes, knickknacks, and what-nots, so he never got to read it. I was going to rummage through some stuff today to see if I could find it, but I don't think I'm emotionally capable of being able to read it (or physically, since I broke my collarbone).\n\nIt feels impossible to forgive myself for not making more of an effort to celebrate his birthday. He always wanted to celebrate mine, and always said it was his favorite day. I usually plan trips around my birthday as March up where I live is dreadfully glum that time of year. The Friday before the trip, my mother called me to see if I could go out that weekend to celebrate my birthday early. Of course I put it off, saying I need time to pack and get things in order around the house, hoping that we could celebrate once I get back from my trip. She is fine with it, and simply asks to give my dad a call in the next few days.\n\nCome Monday, I finally have the time to call him and chat a bit. I've been texting him throughout but haven't talked in a couple weeks. I'm at the gym on the treadmill and give him a ring, but doesn't answer. He's been texting me back, but says he can't talk. His neighbor messages me asking what is going on at the house. I don't know, I've been moved out for years. I keep calling my dad in a panic, and a man answers the phone. It's not him, who the fuck is this guy? All this man could say is \"There is nothing we could do\". \n\nI didn't believe him at the time, and even now I still find it hard to. I was texting him only minutes ago, and he responded to it. Maybe the EMTs did everything they could to try and help him survive his massive heart attack, and truly there was nothing they could have done, but I could have done so much more. Sometimes I hope my life is just as short so I don't have to suffer from the heavy remorse I will have to bear for too long.\n\nI've never gone through a loss like this in recent memory, and I want to move past this mourning and celebrate the rich life he lived. I know he's gone. He would want me to be happy and live my own life. I want to forgive myself for my lackluster attempts of celebrating birthdays, but it feels like I never will. He's done so much good for our family and the community, and I'm comforted to know how so many people loved him. I hope I can find peace soon and learn to emulate his beautiful life.\n\nAs hard as it is now, I will always love his birthday, even if he didn't.

I always worried about her. I never wanted to move away or be apart for an extended period of time. My mom was my safe place. My warmth. My best friend. The person I could always count on, no matter what. I could and would talk to her about anything. There was a rare day when we didn\u2019t communicate on some level. I never could have imagined that my bond with my mom could have grown any stronger, but it did. When my son was born, my mom was finally a grandma. She loved himmore than anything, and wanted to be with him constantly. She once went a week without seeing him, and when she finally did, she cried because she had missed him so much. She only got to spend 8 months with him. I mean, fuck. If anyone deserved to be a grandma, it was her. And we still need her. I constantly want to send her videos of something my son is doing, knowing she would love it, and I remember. I always want to ask her advice, and I can\u2019t. That\u2019s the part about grief that people don\u2019t understand. You have this huge, impossible loss\u2026 then all of these secondary losses, and there are so many. Relationships change, friendships end, and something as small as me never knowing the recipe to the pasta salad she always made brings me to tears at the grocery store. Nothing will be the same. As far as missing her goes, imagine the most you have ever missed a person. How you counted the days down until you would see them again. This hole in your stomach that wasn\u2019t going to be filled until you saw them. Now imagine that person was taken away, and the hole was ripped into a giant, irreparable wound. You see the struggle in a person with physical trauma. Their attempt to complete tasks which were once normal, are no longer possible. You help them. You sympathize, and you are thankful to not have to endure their suffering. Emotional trauma isn\u2019t seen. Just like with physical pain, you struggle to function. You struggle to complete everyday tasks. As much as possible, you hide the pain. People don\u2019t see it, so it doesn\u2019t exist. I can tell you my pain does exist. My emotional pain causes physical pain. Exhaustion. Forgetfulness. As a self-preservation measure, your brain shuts down certain portions in order to protect you from facing/experiencing more trauma. \u201cGrief Brain\u201d It\u2019s like mom brain, or pregnancy brain, but magnified. Also, we can\u2019t forget about the anger, because there is so much of it. Fuck that person for having a mom when I don\u2019t. Oh, I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re having a bad day\u2026 but did your mom die? Oh, your mom is annoying you by calling? I wish I had \u201cthat problem.\u201d My mom was always worried she would be replaced. That I would become a bigger part of my husband\u2019s family than my own. I told her time and time again I could never replace her. I would always need her. She would always be the most important woman in my life. And she was. She continues to be. And the loss of her is unbearable. Some days feel like the first. Some days feel like it\u2019s been so long, I can\u2019t even remember her. Hug your momma if you can.

So many things remind me of him and every now and then, I'll remember a good time and suddenly feel dizzy or my stomach drops like a rollercoaster. For example, around this time in 2014, he introduced me to 'Twin Peaks' and so whenever the weather starts to cool down this time of year and the skies look grey (like they often did in the show), I remember curling on the couch with him and watching that show with him and suddenly I start to feel lightheaded and my stomach drops. Or occasionally I'll drive down a street that I used to take to go to his place and I find myself breathing faster and start gripping the steering wheel tighter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't want to forget him, but at the same time, I feel like any time I remember the time we spent together I start to feel distraught how those good times are over with and those memories have become painful. 'Hackers' was a movie we watched several times together (the opening song 'Orbital' was his favorite song) and when I finally watched it again, I started to feel like I had been punched in the stomach. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWill this pass in time? The only thing I can think of is trying to reintroduce myself to things we did together (rewatching a show we watched together, going to a certain place we went to together, etc) so I don't associate my life as 'Happy with Sam' and now 'Depressed now that Sam isn't here'", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

We don\u2019t know how long she has but I feel like this whole past year and a half has been just one long grieving process as we lose her little by little, with the worst of the loss still to come.\n\nI already know grandpa is going to take it terribly. He\u2019s been the most dedicated towards seeing her and taking her out every day and making sure that she\u2019s being kept well taken care of at the facility. He says he\u2019s going to bring her home now to live with us again and have a nurse here to care for her for as long as she\u2019ll hold out. \n\nHe had a very mild stroke just a couple of weeks ago and I\u2019m very worried about him too as stroke victims are extremely susceptible to repeats.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m on the verge of losing both my grandparents, who practically raised me like a third kid... I try to help as much as I can and keep from crying but it\u2019s just so much", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I grieved about that and made my piece.\n\nMy father was the youngest of a family of 15. I had plenty of uncle to replace my father, but my favorite uncle lived far away.\n\nLast year, he found out he had pancreatic cancer. He degenerated really quickly. He came to a family gathering  that i could not attend due to work to make his peace with his close family, but he was a really proud man, like my father. He didnt want his whole family to see him suffer.\n\nHis wife, my aunt, supported him and nursed him throughout his illness.\n\nWhen the end was near for him, It just so happened that i was on  a work retreat nearby where he lived (about 45 minutes car ride instead of 12 hours plane ride i could never afford) I called my aunt, asking if I was allowed to come visit him one last time. She denied, as he didnt want anyone to see him in his weakened state.\n\nTwo weak after i came back from my trip, he died.\n\nI was invited to the funeral, but as it was very far away it could not afford it.\n\nWhat really bug me is that i could never made my peace to him and say to him how much he meant to me while he was alive. Honestly, It feel even harder than grieving from my dad.\n\nI dont blame my aunt from keeping me from seeing him. I dont blame myself from not being there when he was put into the ground. I just hate that I was not able to talk to him one last time. Telling him how muche he meant to me during my father grieving time.\n\nIn all my life, of all the things i regret. Of all the things i did wrong.

So if you all don't mind, I'm going to tell you about my dog and why she was one of the greatest gifts my life has ever known and why my time with her was one of the most seminal and consequential experiences of my lifetime.\n\nIt started in late 2012 when my grandmother unexpectedly succumbed to a massive heart attack in her sleep.  Because of the circumstances, I blamed myself for not helping my grandmother enough, for not being the one to save her.  I fell into a deep depression, resigned to my windowless bedroom, buried in the darkness, which only diminished a few hours a day when I happened to gain the will to turn on the television and watch sitcoms on mute.\n\nAbout a month or so later, my family did my step-father's cousin a favor and took in his dog while he went off to serve time.  Her name was Paris, and she became our responsibility.\n\nThere was nothing in particular that drew me to her or made me fall in love with her at first sight.  That is, until the cold winter breeze came rolling in a month later.  We couldn't leave her in the garage, so I agreed to let her sleep in my room.  Little did I know, this was the moment that would change my life forever.  I could no longer stay in the darkness of my bedroom every minute of the day.  A dog must be fed, given water, and taken out to use the bathroom.  I had no choice but to fight my depression a few times a day and provide these necessities for her.\n\nAs days turned into weeks and weeks into months, I found myself growing more and more attached.  We even developed routines and patterns.  She'd sleep with her head on my shoulder and my arm wrapped around her until my muscles went numb, then I'd lift my arm up and she'd lay her head against my chest or rib cage and fell asleep to the sound of my heart beat.  When she'd get scared during thunderstorms, she developed a routine in which she would get under the blanket with me and bury her head between my chest and arm until she stopped shaking from fear. I became attuned to her body language, being able to just look at her and tell that she was hungry, thirsty, or needed to go out--little mannerisms that I can't quite explain to others, but I knew how to spot immediately.\n\nAnd when the time came for her to go back to my step-father's cousin, she and I were too close to be separated.  I got down on my knees and, with tears strolling down my face, told her how much she meant to me and thanked her for saving my life.  I would later, upon confirmation that she was and will forever be my dog, I made a promise I vowed to keep--\"no matter what, I will never let anything happen to you.\"\n\nThrough two other dog bites and her pyometra episode, I did exactly that.  I did everything in my power to protect, care, and love her.  For seven years, my daily life revolved around her. Now, it's like there's a void in my life, and it's so painful.\n\nWhen I finally got to her after the two dogs attacked her, she was barely hanging on, but the sight of me and hearing my voice made every tense muscle in her body relax, like she was waiting for me.  In the car, as she lied in my lap bleeding all over me, she still tried to cuddle me.  She tried to lift her head and place on my shoulder, almost as if to comfort me, to let me know it's going to be okay and that she loves me.  It was like she was hugging me goodbye.\n\nWhen the vet said she wouldn't make it and asked me if I wanted to be with her when she passed, I was crying too much to form words but nodded my head emphatically and without a single moment of hesitation.  As she lied on the vet's table with my arms wrapped around her and the life slowly draining out of her, she kept eye contact with me and I watched her as her face slowly relaxed and felt the pauses between each breath grow longer and longer.  I would not leave her side.  And when she finally stopped breathing, all I could do was hold on to her and scream.\n\nThe last words she heard me say to her:  \"You're such a good girl.  Daddy's here, it's okay to go to sleep.  I love you, baby.  Daddy loves you.\"\n\nParis was my life, my world.  She gave me hope, and she helped give me another chance at life outside of my bedroom walls.  She was the best good girl anyone could have asked for.  She was never mean or threatening.  She loved kids, and she liked playing with smaller canines.  She was the perfect pet.\n\nBut now, there's nothing but the memories, photographs, and tokens.  I will never get to hold her again, kiss her forehead, watch her go nuts for a treat, wake up in the middle of the night to let her get in my bed because of the scary fireworks or lightning strikes, hear her whine when she hears my mother's voice, walk her down her favorite new trail, feel her wet nose nudge me because she needs to pee RIGHT NOW, feel the warmth of her body as she lays by my side with her head on my shoulder or over my beating heart, see her eat the ranch off a salad and spit the lettuce out, watch her sleep on my dirty clothes despite her new $40 bed being a mere two feet away, or rub her belly and tell her she's a good girl and daddy's big ole baby.\n\nI know one day this pain will become manageable, but for right now it's all I have.  And it hurts so fucking much.\n\nI love you, babygirl.  You will forever be my good girl, my best friend.  And for that, I could never thank you enough.  You showed me a kind of love I had never experienced, and you helped show me that living is worthwhile after all.  \n\nIn your memory, I vow to do these things:  1) Keep living like you still need me, 2) Show the same kindness and love to others that you showed me, 3) Walk that new trail you fell in love with on my days off, just as I had planned to do with you, and 3) Never forget the joy and happiness you brought me and I brought you.\n\nI love you, babygirl, and I already miss you so fucking much. Be a good girl, like you always were. I love you.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

She was old, but extremely healthy, so I let her do as she pleased. I wanted her last senior years to be spoiled and wonderful. I fed her the best food I could buy, set up the best spots for her in the house. I always assumed she would get sick and need to be put down. It would be painless and on my terms.

The one who took me in when I was just an infant and had been severally abused by the people who were supposed to care for me. You see, me and my adopted mother didn\u2019t always get along. When she was first diagnosed with COPD, her personality slowly shifted from the person who adored me to a person who would spite me at every chance she got. When I was old enough to go to college, I slowly withdrew myself until we hardly spoke. I would ignore constant pleas for me to talk to her, hang out with her, do anything with her. At the time, I thought I was cutting out a toxic person from my life. I was getting myself out of the abuse that had become a daily part of my life.\n\nNow? I don\u2019t even really remember any of the abuse that drove me to that point. All I can remember is every good thing about her and every time I denied her towards the end. You see, my mom was not perfect. She came from a horrific abusive past, one where she grew up being sexually abused by her uncle. She was physically and verbally abused by her alcoholic parents. The abuse followed her well into adulthood as she escaped two physically and verbally abusive marriages until eventually marrying my father. It wasn\u2019t like she died suddenly either. No. I watched her struggle for an entire week. I watched this person who I realized I loved with every fiber of my being, wither away, unhappy and confused. I listened to her suffocate on her own saliva. I answered back with a lie when she asked me if she was going to die. I hand fed her only for her to spit it up because food was too hard. I changed her diapers and cleaned her face. That week will never leave my mind. It is planted there, and it\u2019s been 5 months and 21 days. She is close to being 6 months gone. Half a year already gone and it still feels like the grief is strangling me.\n\nThe worst part of it all? The other losses that follow when you find yourself in one of the deepest pits in your life. The friends who leave because you\u2019re not the same person anymore and you\u2019re too damaged. The family members who have moved on and expect the same of you, fighting you tooth and nail, having no idea what it was like to watch someone slowly die because they refused to be there for that part. The sitting in your room sobbing because you are absolutely alone and struggling with nobody left to offer you a hand up. You see, everyone is all \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss\u201d and \u201cmy condolences\u201d and \u201ccontact me if you need anything\u201d the first week or two.

Nobody warns you until after the fact that you will probably be in shock at first. That you will feel nothing. That you will be numb. That you won\u2019t feel any pain at all, then eventually the emotions start to tumble in. You go from sad to angry to depressed to back to numb to forgetting for a few days to back to angry. At some point you\u2019re even in denial. She can\u2019t possibly be dead? Right. All of this has to be some cruel sick prank! No way is my family in shambles, my \u201cbest friends\u201d missing, and my mother ashes on a mantle piece. So you call her phone. You call it over and over again. Then it hits you she really is gone. So now you\u2019re back on the cycle. You\u2019re angry then you\u2019re sad then you\u2019re depressed then...\n\nEveryone keeps saying it will get better. It will get easier. The truth? I don\u2019t think it will. I think you learn to live with it. I think you begin to adapt to part of your soul missing. I think you begin to forget the details for a few weeks, maybe even a few months, while you distract yourself with silly little things like college and work and going out with friends. Then you will see something that will remind you of that missing piece. Then for the next few days, maybe even weeks, you\u2019re crying and angry and in distress until you force yourself to forget again. Then reality sets in. You realize you will be forced to lose parts of your soul over and over and over again. That every single person you care about and love will one day die leaving you a shell of your former self. Now life just seems pointless in general. What\u2019s the point in living just to suffer? I have had Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Depression my entire life. Even when I was so low I attempted to take my own life... that pain is nothing to grief. I can\u2019t quite describe what the difference is, but I can definitely tell this is a deeper pain then anything I will ever experience.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My head can't wrap around it.\n\nIn August, my boyfriend's aunt had committed suicide and it was my first death that really hit me on a personal level. I've dealt with suicidal feelings for a long time, his family is family to me. The moments spent crying with my boyfriend and his family, being around while they mourn has been very hard. It never helped we we're all in different states (my bf and I are ldr, and he moved states for work).\n\nNow, today at 2am, my cousin in Australia asked me on Facebook messenger if I heard the news. I obviously didn't know what he was talking about, but my dad and his sister have been fighting and are on non speaking terms and so I thought it was related to that. Then he mentioned our cousins name. I was confused because.. we never really heard from him. Hes distances himself for awhile, especially ever since his twin daughters were born last year. \n\nMy cousin called me and said our cousin had committed suicide. From what I'm told, he and his girlfriend had broken up. I know there's been strain with him and his parents and when it came to taking care of his kids. I guess he just felt like he had no support. \n\nIt's been really hard for so many reasons. Suicide alone is hard. My family is countries away and it's been hard. My family has been fighting and it's hard to tell them to just get their shit together. It's been difficult knowing how my bf's aunt went is the same how my cousin went. Its been hard that it's a way I've attempted. It's been hard that I've been talking to all my cousins, trying to really be the strong one. Everyone is just shocked. It's been really eye opening to a lot of my family members.\n\n.. in all of this, all I feel is just longing and missing my family. Sure, my parents and my sisters and our other cousins are here, but just about everyone else is on the other side of the world and it's so hard to cope with that. I just keep wishing there was more I could do, if things could have been helped or any different if we were closer.\n\nI feel like I also got the head start when it came to grieving suicides. In this span of three months, trying to understand the suicide of another, coping with my suicidal feelings after the fact, and now my cousins passing.. it's like.. I feel it. I understand. I know how I can help the rest of my family to the best of my abilities when it comes to grief. But I'm shattered. It doesn't change he's still gone. It doesn't change we're still hurt. The component of distance really tears me apart. Unlike being able to travel from one state to another within a week of you had to, it's almost impossible when you're on the other side of the world. The time difference makes it hard just to be there when they need me.\n\nThe past three months, I've just been exhausted with grief. It hurts when it's starting to make me feel numb and trauma like if I don't do my best to be here for the ones I love. I just miss my family. I want everything to be okay again.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

It\u2019s all I can do to function most days and my coping mechanisms are truly making it worse. I know I need help but I don\u2019t have it in me to care enough. I don\u2019t have it in me to make it another day. To be a part of society, to do basic things. It\u2019s so hard to get others to understand what your going through a s why you are the way you are. They slowly but surely give up on you and who can blame them really? They have feelings to.

It\u2019ll take god himself to stick around me these days. I don\u2019t see much of him either if at all.  \n\n\nI do need that support but there are other issues involved that add to my pain with him. He is tender, loving, caring, and kind but I always feel he\u2019s hiding something. It eats me up inside. Causes me horrible anxiety and makes me cry non stop. Idk if it\u2019s true or if it\u2019s my brains way of not thinking about my son and protecting me as well as making me convinced that I\u2019m being betrayed so I will reject him before he does me. It\u2019s so difficult when it\u2019s such deep deep painful wounds your dealing with and then the wounds of the past come forward a at once but you don\u2019t think of them consciously. \n\nThey are there no doubt though. \n\nWhat makes this the hardest I think is the lack of a way to explain to people why you are this way b/c you don\u2019t know. How do you explain losing the person you love more than anything in this world  to suicide? \nHow? \nHow? \nHow do you explain that you love them but you are so scared you can\u2019t think straight. You have panic attacks daily. You plan your death daily. You need them but don\u2019t know how to be normal anymore. How do you explain that? \n\nI need advice b/c idk what to do anymore. I don\u2019t have the strength nor do I care enough to do anything about it. I\u2019m tired of being \u201cstrong\u201d I\u2019m not feeling sorry for myself I\u2019m just truly tired. This isn\u2019t my first really tragic death my second or third  but definitely my worst. \nTo make matters worse my partners family doesn\u2019t like him dating .. at all. They never have. They want him to theirselves and I get that I do but they are all like that not just the kids. It\u2019s really bizarre. Why wouldn\u2019t you want your grown child, your father, your brother, nephew whatever.. to be happy? I want him to be happy. His happiness makes me happy. But I don\u2019t bring him happiness anymore and he keeps me separated from his family to appease them. Not me cuz they don\u2019t bother me at all. \n\nI\u2019d like to know them better. They have no desire to know me. So he separates us and I get left behind. \nIf I told you the lengths he goes  to do this you would be amazed and probably tell me to move on. \nThe need to please others is so ingrained in him that he sacrifices my feelings AND his to do so.\nNot always but enough to really, really hurt. \nMy son died I can\u2019t change that and it is a pain that is unbearable so fucking unbearable and I\u2019m supposed to just get on with my life and act normal? \nHow in the hell do you do that? \nHow? \nThanks for listening to my crazy rant.. \nanother day. \nJust another day.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I never had a Dad, so growing up my Mother took on a fatherly role, going to work when I was six weeks old to provide for us and my Nana took on a more motherly role. I have spent almost every day with her, with little more than a weeks break if I've been on holiday.\n\nIn later years, my Nana hasn't had it great, suffering lymphodema, arthritis and an overall suffering of ill health which meant a lot of time we spent together in the past 5 or 6 years she depended on me (not that she'd admit it) but I liked that. I didn't do this out of duty, I did this out of love and the fact that I wanted to. I loved helping her and being her first port of call. She never needed question where or how she was ever going to do anything, as she knew that I would be there to do it for her. We've talked about death over the years in passing, and I knew pretty much everything she wanted already for a funeral which was a blessing really as if we hadn't have had these chats in passing over the years, I would not have been able to cope guessing what she wanted. \n\nShe was my best friend, my only friend. Yet now, I feel like I'm just carrying on as normal and it's like I'm still expecting her to give me a call. I can't get through my day if I actually sit and admit to myself she has died, so I choose to ignore it and treat it as though it's not happening.\n\nWhen she died, I seemed to feel nothing which was more distressing than the death. Work offered me one days bereavement leave as \"on paper she is only a grandmother\" which disgusted me, and I couldn't afford to lose anymore time. \n\nI feel as though I feel very little and that I am still numb, and I can either cry at the slightest of things, or not at all. I have attempted to slide back into normal life, but everything feels so empty now and I feel like I'm functioning on autopilot. \n\nI'm a little bit stuck with where to go, and still don't feel the devastation I really know deep down that I do feel.

About a week later we found out that he had high cholesterol and it was most likely a heart attack, but an autopsy would not be performed. \n\nMy brothers and family flew into town in the next few days and I've been surrounded by them until 2 days ago. I returned to work yesterday and I'm trying to act as normal as possible. I'm having a lot of trouble processing that he's gone and I have a lot of intrusive thought about how he looked and felt like. I have a counseling appointment tomorrow but I can't even remember short term things like if I cleaned the room after a patient or what I wore or ate yesterday, let alone study for the 2 classes that I'm enrolled in.\n\nIn addition, I have 3 younger brothers, one is severely handicapped and since my mother is bipolar and a substance abuser, I have to at least appear like I'm staying strong for them. I'm the only one left in town with my handicapped brother who my dad took 1-2 times a month, so I'm picking up that responsibility as his caretakers and advocate as well. Then comes the stress that even though my parents have been separated and estranged for 15 years, they're still legally married so the woman who cant even manage her medications (her sisters keep them in a safe and allocate them to her) is looking at managing $400k of assets.\n\nHas anyone been through something similar? I'm so lost and I need help.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

She had not been feeling well recently, and it turns out her health was deteriorating. My mom came to her house to do yard work, and my grandma was in rough shape.

I texted him on the 12th, 11 days after he last sent me a message and they wouldn\u2019t deliver. I sent another one a few days later. \n\nMy friend has had cancer since he was 5, and he\u2019s 2 months shy of 19. This Saturday I got a text from his friend back home where he\u2019s from (as he moved to another city for treatment), saying he wasn\u2019t doing well, and they were trying to make him as comfortable as possible. His mom wanted him to send people a text so there\u2019s no confusion &amp; how he knows he\u2019s so loved even if he can\u2019t read them.\nMy fear came true, but I reminded ignorantly hopeful. \n\nI\u2019ve been crying off and on since that Saturday, but this morning while in the shower, I was snooping and looking for more answers and found a Facebook with updates. They weren\u2019t good, and his family is ready to let him go.  I bawled till the water went cold. I\u2019ve never cried this hard in my life. I\u2019m not ready to let him go. I know 13 years is a long painful time to have cancer, but I haven\u2019t gotten the chance to say goodbye. I last sent him a meme, he replied but I never did. I remember the exact moment I read it but didn\u2019t respond, as I was coming out of class to go home. I wish I knew he would be admitted to the hospital a few days later. I wish I would\u2019ve texted him before he became worse, to say goodbye. I was probably off doing fuck all, not knowing what was going on. I wish I knew.

Among some other saddening details some of you might be familiar with. I asked his mom if it was okay to see him before he goes. She said he\u2019s not awake and they don\u2019t expect him to be here much longer. I asked her if she could tell him how much I love him, and told her about the stuff he and my boyfriend had in common, how I never felt cool enough to be his friend as he is so talented as a musician. I thanked her for updating people she\u2019s never met before, and sending love. \n\nI feel guilty for doing anything but thinking about him; even just for half a second. I know at any moment he\u2019s going to go and I\u2019m going to be here doing something, totally oblivious till I get an update. I could be laughing just for a second, as he takes his final breaths. It doesn\u2019t feel right. I feel guilty for even asking to see him before he goes, his parents don\u2019t know me. No one but he did. I feel guilty for hurting. I wasn\u2019t his best friend.

I moved back in with my mom after my divorce so she and I live together. Her boyfriend\u2019s daughters (in their 30s) came here with their two small children last week when their father wasn\u2019t doing well - they live across the country. We had previously only met the one daughter once last year. \n\nThe one daughter was not terribly kind to my mother ever and continued that when they arrived at the hospital. They would say things to make us feel like we weren\u2019t really a part of anything \u201cwell we\u2019re the daughters\u201d and once they told my mom to shut up when she was asking an innocent question. We were careful not to overstep as we knew they were the ones to make decisions. Still, we bought them new blankets and snacks and offered our apartment although it is small (two bedroom one bathroom). Their father has an apartment he shares with a roommate. \n\nThey took us up on the offer that first night when they rang our bell at 3:40 in the morning. And crashed there for the next few days. They would talk well into the night and early morning loudly, have the tv on, the kids would wrestle on the floor, food was left out all night and my mom or I would clean it when she/I woke up to use the restroom, they turned the air on without asking, and would leave the kids alone at home while everyone was out. When he passed away that night we all again came back to our apartment. My sister had joined us at this point. Again they stayed up until 2 or 3 am talking loudly and with the tv on. My mom was trying to get some sleep and grieve. The next morning they were rude to us about what needed to happen. When we asked how we could help they said they were still sleeping - except the one daughter supposedly had a flight back home that night for a wedding, and we didn\u2019t know if they needed a ride. She was going to come back here after the wedding. We felt like we couldn\u2019t cry or mourn because we had to be strong around the kids, and with 7 people in one apartment we didn\u2019t know how long this would be the situation. My mom didn\u2019t want to be home. \n\nMy sister as kindly as possible asked them what the plan was. They became upset and went to their father\u2019s apartment. At which point they then accused my mom of stealing items of his (she didn\u2019t because it was found eventually) and they then said that their mother was the true love of their father\u2019s life ( they\u2019ve been divorced for over 15 years after she cheated). \n\nStill, I feel terribly guilty for not sucking it up and allowing them to stay indefinitely. It came down to making a choice that was better for my mom or for them. It wasn\u2019t until Monday after they had gone that my mom was able to let it all out in the comfort of her home.

I told her I'd be there in two hours, how long it took me to get to her from work. She said \"Okay, I love you more than anything. I want you to know that.\"\u00a0\n\nI knew then that she didn't think she'd make it and so I left my office and took off as fast as I could. Halfway there, I got a call that she'd lost consciousness and they were doing cpr. I floored it the rest of the way, I don't know how no cops stopped me. I made it there in no time and I ran into the hospital and the doctor took me aside and told me she'd coded and they couldn't do anymore for her. The pain she'd had last week had been a heart attack and she'd suffered another right when she'd come in to the hospital and she just couldn't make it. I went into her room and I held her hand as she passed. I stood in her room and held her until the coroner came. I cried so hard I threw up. I can't sleep, I can't eat, I can't drink, I can't even really breathe and I don't know what to do. Everything reminds me of her. I see her everywhere, I think of her constantly. All I can see when I close my eyes is her in the hospital. She looked so small and frail and unlike herself. All I can hear is her telling me she loved me. Her birthday was next week, I already had her party planned. I keep thinking about the holidays and wondering how on earth I'm going to get through them without her. \n\nAnd then I keep being angry with myself for not seeing her more, not visiting last weekend, not pushing her harder to go to the doctor last week. I feel so guilty and angry with myself.\u00a0\n\nThen today, I had to go to the funeral home to make arrangements. I found out that she hadn't been paying on her life insurance so her expenses aren't covered. I'm currently still paying on my son's adoption expenses so I can't afford the ten grand out of pocket that the funeral home is asking for the bare bones basic burial. And I hate that I can't do that for her, that she can't be with my grandpa, that she has to be cremated because the twenty five hundred dollars is more affordable than the ten grand. I hate that she can't have the ceremony she deserved because she was the kindest and sweetest and most selfless person on this planet.\n\nI'm just so tired and broken and hurt. I feel like I have a gaping hole in my chest and everything sets me off and sends me into a crying fit again.\u00a0\n\nHow do I move forward when my whole world feels wrong? My grandma was everything to me and I don't know what to do.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

(Grandma vs. Father)", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "Before you start reading, know that this is a long post. If you want to skip the reading and answer the questions I understand. But you'll have to read it if you need more information about the situation.\n\nMy grandma on my Dad's side found out she had lung cancer about two years ago. She went through chemotherapy and everything seemed fine. 2 months go the doctors told her that the lung cancer was back and had spread to her bone and liver, and they are all stage 4. When we found out the cancer came back she got sick as you would expect, but then last month she started doing better than she had in years. She went from laying in bed all day to wanting me to go take her to a restaurant for lunch. \n\nI had been visiting her every weekend. I can't during the week due to college classes and work. I was suppose to see her Saturday. We were going to go to lunch and scrapbook (her favorite thing). We always plan the next weekend during my visits, so this was planned last Saturday. \n\nMonday she called me and told me that I can still come over, but she has to stay in bed. I didn't think much of it, I dont except her to be feeling good all the time.\n\nYesterday I got a call from her daughter saying she was doing really bad. She is not expected to live to Saturday night. I went to see her as soon as I got out of class and I took the rest of the day off from work. I  was heartbroken when I saw her. They gave her some many drugs to help ease everything for her. She was in and out of consciousness. She would make some sounds and sometimes speak a few words every now and then. She couldn't sit up. She had to wear diapers. It was very clear these were probably going to be the last few days of her life. \n\nMy Grandma is my first real death. My father (her son) died when I was 14, 8 years ago. We had a very rocky relationship due to his bipolar disorder, and drug and alcohol abuse. He verbally abused a lot. Anyway, he packed everything up and moved from Missouri (where we live) to California. He had visited every two years, but called every other month. All a sudden he decided he was going to fight my mom for custody. It was awful, I had to explain to lawyers why my sister and I went through with the abuse and why we don't  want to live with him. We were told he was packing his stuff (to move back to take the case to court) and he had a massive heart attack. He died before before the ambulance got to him. For a very long time I was confused and angry at him. I felt like he stirred up all these feelings trying to get custody of me and my sister after not seeing him for two years, then he just disappeared. I didn't get to say goodbye. At his funeral I had a panic attack, and I was diagnosed with Persistent Depressive Disorder two years later. There was just so many feelings that I was consumed by, especially due to things that happened in the past. I felt like I had moved on from those feelings since then due to the help of loved ones and therapy. \n\nFast forward to the present. My grandma is the first person who I am literally watching die. She was fine Saturday, and now she can barely talk to me or even stay awake. My family keeps saying, \"Your father will greet her, and make sure she's ok\". I know they mean well, but they definitely had a completely different relationship with him than I did. \n\nFor me, this is all bringing up all lot of things that I am not sure I understand yet. Since Monday when I knew she was probably getting sick again, I started not being able to fall asleep or stay asleep. After yesterday I thunk I have began to shut down. Today, I have been up since 12:30am and I am writing this at 6am. I have math test, other classes, and work tomorrow. I've lost my appetite. I can't focus on anything else. Yesterday I had a chemistry test that I am pretty sure I failed. I almost started crying in the middle of it. I knew the material, but I cant think about anything else. \n\nIs this grieving? Can you grieve before your loved one passes away? \n\nI know its different for everyone. It feels different than when my dad died. With my dad it was sudden, I was angry, and it took a while to truly \"grieve\". I had been spending so much time with grandma, and it breaks my heart to see her go through this.\n\nI'm sorry I know this was a lot to read, and I definitely dumped my feelings onto this sub. I appreciate any tips or advice about any of this. Especially anyone who has had similar experiences.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

They say it always comes in threes, well, that time it came in fours. First my father, then my grandfather, my great aunt, and lastly, my great grandpa. (I was very close to all of these people.) They were all gone within a three month time period. It was too much for me to process, so I didn't. I decided to be strong and deal with the circumstances with stocisim. All I could think about was everyone else and how they deserved to be more sad than I was. I think I only made it to the anger stage of grief, in relation to my father's death. I was so very angry with him for not taking better care of himself. He did drink too much, and ultimately, that's what killed him at age 41. He had three children, he should have been here for us.\n\nAround age 14 I cried, hard, for the first time really, since his funeral. The anger finally transformed into sadness. I didn't know how to handle so much grief, so again, I chose not to. I tucked my sadness deep down in order to prevent myself from having another breakdown like that. I couldn't let it happen.\n\nFast forward to age 23, I'm getting divorced after a little more than a year of marriage. I was so unhappy... I tried everything and really the problem was we shouldn't have gotten married. We weren't compatible long term. He didn't want a wife, he wanted a mother. I couldn't do it. He was a mess, heartbroken, sad, he was grieving our relationship while complaining to me/telling me how I ruined his life. I guess I didn't have much of an opportunity to grieve while trying to defend myself and set boundaries. He wasn't allowed to cry to me about how sad he was anymore. He said I was cold. Maybe I was. \n\nDuring the part where we separated, before we officially divorced, my grandmother passed away. She was my best friend growing up. I used to call her often, especially if I wasn't getting along with my mother. She was my person back then. I remember thinking I was glad she didn't have to see me go through the divorce, but she knew it was coming. I remember the day I got the call - her brother called me - my great uncle. He said \"your granny's in the hospital, she's not doing very well and I need you to tell your mother.\" Me? Really? How did this get tossed in my lap? How do you tell your mom that her mother is dying? The answer is, you just do it, because she needs to know and every minute you spend contemplating the right way to break the news is one less minute she has while her mother is still alive. \n\nI thought losing my father was hard, but I was only nine, and if you tell a child \"it's going to be okay\" they tend to believe you. When they said \"it's going to be okay\" at 23, I knew they were lying. \n\nI think of her often. She was such a light in my life. I knew her well, and miss her every day. \n\nNow, age 30, I'm realizing I've spent my life running from grief. I realized this when any time someone mentioned grief and how it affected them I couldn't stop the tears from running down my face. I realize maybe this grief is why I've felt so lonely, all these years, so incomplete. The people that I loved so much, and took up such large spaces in my heart are gone.   \n\n\nI'm hoping if I stop hiding maybe it will stop hurting so damn much. Maybe people won't see an underlying sadness behind my smile. I guess its a step in the right direction.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

WHY is this happening to me?? it was almost like watching a movie. like everything was happening but it wasn't real. it was all on screen and i was just watching from above. \n\ni kept repeating that this wasn't real. i kept thinking that i would get a message that just said, \"they revived her\" or even \"we overreacted. she's ok, she's at the hospital. we will all be here visiting her when you get done work.\"\n\nbut none of that came.\n\ni drove myself home after finally convincing my boss that i was ok. \n\nshe told me to text her when i got home. \n\ni never did. \n\ni just can't accept the condolences because there shouldn't be any. she should be at home, curled up on the couch reading Stephen King (her favourite author) or watching True Crime shows that we used to groan about growing up but now all love. she shouldn't be dead. \n\npeople keep saying, \"i can't image what your going through.\"\n\nand i just want to scream, \"neither can i!\"\n\nthis feels like a bad dream. like i'll wake up tomorrow morning and she'll be in the kitchen making a coffee or sitting on the couch watching the news with my dad. life just doesn't feel the same anymore. and i don't know what to do. it's like my brain just can't handle it. like everytime i think about it, i just shut down. \n\neveryone keeps saying i have to be strong for my dad and my siblings, but i can't function without her. i have to write the eulogy because no one else knows how. but i even know myself. i can't even type her name without wanting to scream and cry.\n\nhow am i supposed to say goodbye to the person who taught me how to talk? without her, i wouldn't have a heart so how could i possibly say goodbye to the person who gave me the damn thing in the first place? she's the reason i'm alive. how do i let go?\n\ni don't know how to write her eulogy because i can't even process the fact that i need to write it in the first place. i can't cope, and i don't think i ever will. \n\ni hate myself for not giving her the world and more like she deserved. i just want five more minutes to tell her how much i love her and how much i miss her, and how sorry i am for not doing more to help her. \n\ni should've been a better daughter. \n\ni don't know how to tell people that the only thing i want more in the world is for my mum to hug me and tell me it's going to be okay.\n\ni could say i'm happy she's \"in a better place\" and not suffering. but fuck. why can't that better place be with me? \n\ni don't know what to do.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

For a week I was by her side with other family members as her health declined and we watched her go. We had her funeral yesterday and it was so painful. My faith is Hindu and our family is very traditional. I grew up with my grandmother, she helped raise me and my older brother for 19 years and when she started to get sick we had to put her in a nursing home. We watched her health decline for years, but at least 2-3 times a week either my parents, aunt or I would visit her, feed, her and sit by her side. She stopped talking a few years ago and it was mainly silence but I was okay with that.\n\nI'm writing on this page because of the incredible amount of pain I'm feeling. I've never lost anyone so close to me before, my other grandparents died before I was born. Everyone keeps telling me to be strong and I don't want to be. I feel tired, my eyes are all puffy and I don't feel hungry. I keep thinking of the last 3-4 days when she was so sick and I can't get those images off my mind. It's also Diwali time which is even harder because this is such a special time for my family and we are unable to celebrate this year. I'm also married and my husband has been so loving and supportive but I feel so much guilt because I feel sad and depressed around him. He got close with my grandmother too and its hard for him but I feel bad that I'm grieving around him.

Today, a woman and her adult daughter came into the shop. The woman was wearing a tiara and asked if I wanted to know why she was wearing it. I said yes and she excitedly shared that today was her last day of chemo. After many congratulations, they ordered their donuts and coffee. The woman reminded me of my aunt who passed from cancer this past April. My aunt was one of the kindest people I know- she would give you the clothing off of her back. Embracing her giving spirit, I gave the two women their donuts and coffee on the house. We shared a teary eyed hug and they left. \n\nShortly after they left I noticed the tip jar was looking a bit full so I emptied it out and exchanged the coins into bills and the smaller bills for larger ones. Nothing out of the ordinary. A couple of hours later, before I was about to leave, the tip jar was looking full again so I did the same thing. Except this time, when I dumped it out, among the coins and bills was a medal, around the size of a quarter with an angel on it. My first thought was that the woman from early must have dropped it in there, but I remembered I had already emptied out the tip jar after she left. I was reluctant at first, but I think this is a sign from my aunt. I always wanted to believe in signs from Heaven but was scared I would never get one. Today I did.

This is my first post here so sorry in advance for the formatting issues.\n\nTo paint a picture of the man my father was, he was raised and lived in the rural area of Valpo, Indiana (he did some moving around but mainly stayed that area). It is a country and dirt-poor area. He was an extremely funny guy and had many talents. He never went to college, but he did graduate high school and then proceeded to join the army, where he did active duty and was, shortly after, sent to Iraq. There he was injured very badly. He became disabled and was declared, by the state of Indiana 90 disabled (had he been 100%, my younger siblings, who were raised in an unstable, poor household, would have been set). He used a breathing machine that not only allowed him to properly breather, but thinned his bones. It progressively became more and more difficult for my father to walk. His ankle verted under his weight and his knees were very weak. He couldn't walk up and down stairs easily, and only did to see either my brother or I. He did not go upstairs in his own home, where his bedroom was located. He slept on a recliner. He didn't have a job either, he relied on his disabled checks to keep him afloat. He couldn't move well and he couldn't drive so this was really one of his only options. His girlfriend was a waitress and cook and they scrapped to get by. My father made alot more than her just by his checksand she relied on him for money. They fought alot and he had struck her on numerous occasions.\n\n    \n\nMy mother and him got a divorce when I was young and I took it hard. We moved very far away and I only had one yearly visit that didn't always occur. He was my 'favorite' parent and I made that abundantly clear to my mom. Growing up, I pushed myself to be the best I could, especially better than my brother, so my dad would notice me. When I was pushing myself, I would tell myself that if I wasn't the best, my dad would either die, not love me, or never see my again. I ended up all A's with honors, polite, and a pretty popular kid. In my young teenage years my emotions became more and more violent. I'd yell at my mother and call her horrible names, completely trash my room, and self harm. I shaved my head during this time and my father dissapointingly asked me if I was a lesbian. I took this hard. I wanted nothing but to impress him. Mind you, he lived in another state so I had very little communication with him. He didn't call, not even on holidays or birthdays. \n\n    \n\nGrowing up, I was so scared of my father not loving me that I wouldn't ask him to spend a penny on me when I visited him. I wouldn't ask him for anything to eat or drink unless he just handed it to me. I ended up passing out from dehydration once because I refused to ask my father to buy me a water. I've also had heat stroke several times when with him. \n\n    \n\nMy dad was a really cool guy. He thought of himself as a punk-ass player (I'm 100% certain that would make him laugh) even though deep down he was a soft and caring guy.  He died in the car, my uncle was driving him and it was my uncle's birthday. There is more I want to say, but I will leave it at this for now.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I have a son. He is 2 years old. I'm still married but haven't seen my (still) wife for about 9 months already, nor my son.\n\n\nSo, before all this.\n\n\nWe were together for around 6-7 years. I loved her to death. She said she loved me a lot too. We were one of these couples that rarely fight and were living together for a year and a half already.\n\n\nThen, she told me she was pregnant. I told her that she could have it or we could get her an abortion, that I was fine with either choice. So she decided to have it.\n\n\nEverything was fine. Until our baby was born.\n\n\nWe couldn't handle parenthood. We didn't have time for each other. I started falling into depression. She did too. Then we started fighting, every single day. I used to stay all night taking care of the baby so my wife could sleep and then I would go to work. I was able to stand it for 1 week only. I started to perform really bad at my job, which was a call center. They fired me. It was my first job. Had been there for about 3 years but they didn't think to see what was wrong with me, just felt like replacing me. We struggled with income for a time, but we managed. Most of our fights where because we didn't have enough money. I recall having to walk about 30 minutes or more cause I didn't even have money for the bus.\n\n\nWe split up after 2 months. She went with her parents and I went with mine. We were still seeing each other, she said she missed me and wanted to be with me and I wanted to be with her. I missed her with all my being. I was still deep into depression and started to go deeper. All I could think is I missed her and couldn't help myself but think our baby was the source of all of our problems. I hated him.\n\n\nTime passed and I was jumping from job to job cause I wasn't able to hold any for too long.\n\n\nI hadn't finished my studies so all I could do where call centers. I got a job where they would allow me to do overtime regularly. So I started working 11-14 hours a day convincing myself that this would bring my wife back. I started spending time with my baby trying to show her how good father I can be.\n\n\nTime passed and things where worse. She didn't want to see me nor have anything to do with me. She said she wanted to divorce but I didn't want to. I cried every day cause I missed her so bad and she didn't want me close.\n\n\nI started establishing a good relationship with my baby. He loved me and I loved him. He would choose me over anyone. But my wife refused to let me have him alone for a day. She always wanted to be there.\n\n\nI was still deep into depression. I was struggling tons. I was contemplating into a way out. Like suicide.\n\n\nLost my job. Again.\n\n\nMy wife's parents (where she was living at the moment) live really far from my parents house (where I was living), literally from one end to the other end of the city. I would spend more than half my paycheck visiting them. I felt a lot of shame on telling her that I had lost my job again, so instead I told her I wouldn't have the money to visit them too often.\n\n\nThis is where my new life starts\n----------\nI have an uncle that moved to another state. He litteraly lives at the other side of the country. He started working at restaurants. He has been chef at a lot of 5 stars restaurants and works really hard.\n\n\nA few years ago he told me to go with him, but I refused. I was scared and didn't want to leave my wife.\n\n\nI texted him. Told him about that offer he gave me a while back. He replied back instantly and said that he was glad I reached him and that when did I wanted to go. I asked him as soon as I can, but the problem is that I didn't have any money. He said it was fine but he would need some time to make the arrangements.\n\n\nI didn't tell anyone about it. Only him, his siblings (4 plus my mom) his wife, my sister and my grandmother knew. The only person that endorsed my decision was my uncle. Everyone refused to take me there and they discouraged me to do it. They said that I can't just go and live at his house cause he is such a hard worker and if I'm not up to the task he would send me back.\n\n\nHe said that he was the one in charge of the house and that nobody else will decide who can or not live in there.\n\n\nHe told me 4 weeks.\n\n\nI have a good relationship with my sister. We talk to each other a lot and we usually play a lot of videogames together. She said that she would miss me but if I thought that is what I needed, to go for it.\n\n\nIt's been 2 weeks.\n\n\nI had no money. My wife was pissed cause she didn't have enough. Or better said: I wasn't giving her the same amount I was giving her before). I hadn't told her yet that I was leaving nor that I lost my job. AGAIN. So I borrowed money from 4 different people just for the expenses of my kid. My mother didn't have enough money to feed me so I just ate rice all these 3 weeks, mentally preparing for the trip.\n\n\n4 days before leaving I told my wife I was planning on leaving, but didn't tell her when. She was shocked. She said she couldn't believe me but I told her I wasn't joking. To a place that is far away from our hometown.\n\n\nShe started saying that she didn't want me to go and what would happen with the kid.\n\n\nI told her that I would come to visit them often.\n\n\nShe said she loved me.\n\n\nI was still in love with her, but that didn't stop me.\n\n\n2 days later, it was supossed to be payday so I had to give her money. I told her that my bank was restraining my money and that they didn't give me an answer. She was mad. Pissed and started swearing at me.\n\n\n1 day before leaving. She didn't know I was leaving the next day. I told her that the bank hadn't given me an answer yet and that I didn't have money. She wouldn't reply to me. She always said that it didn't matter how mad she was or what our problems where that she would never refuse to let me see the kid nor be with him. So I told her that I wanted to see my baby. But she didn't reply all day.\n\n\nNext day. 5 am my mother woke me up and left me at the bus station. At 2 pm I texted my wife that I was half-way the trip and then turned off the phone. I felt a lot of anxiety. I didn't knew when I would go back nor if I would get a good job, whatsoever.\n\n\nI got at my uncle's house at midnight. I saw people I hadn't seen 10 or more years. They received me with a big smile.\n\n\nNext day my uncle took me to a few restaurants to apply. I had no experience in the kitchen nor in the front. But he said that was no problem cause he had contacts. He told me to go certain 5 star restaurant where he worked at. I said I wanted to start as a dishwasher since I had NO experience. He almost slapped me in the face. He told me to apply as a busser or gtfo of the city now.\n\n\nWhen I applied I didn't put him as a reference so they said that they couldn't give me the job. Plus I told them I had no experience.\n\n\nWhen I got home I told him about it. He said to wait and hang up. He called 15 minutes later and said they would call me back. 1 minute later the manager called asking me if I could start tomorrow.\n\n\nOnce I decided to turn on my phone. I received messages from my wife. She was pissed saying: Why didn't you even came to say good bye to me or your son? I wanted to explain her that I intended to but I didn't say anything about it.\n\n\nBack to my new job.\n\n\nI struggled a lot. I breaked a lot of stuff. Wasn't as fast as the others. Everyone hated me. Nobody would speak to me and they would treat me like garbage. I felt like garbage.\n\n\nOnly 3 persons treated me with kind. 2 girls, which where sisters, and a guy. They where the only ones I would speak to. Chefs would look at me as if they wanted to kill me. Managers didn't speak to me, only the one that hired me but he would usually avoid me. Servers didn't ask me for anything.\n\n\nDespite all that, I had the will to learn.\n\n\nMy first paycheck was 7 times what I was earning back at a callcenter. I couldn't believe it. I had never had so much money in my hands. I started spending money in things I ever wanted to have. Bought an Iphone XR, bought an alienware laptop, bought clothes. I felt like a rich person. I only sent like 1/10 to my wife and my kid.\n\n\nI had nobody to talk about it so I called my dad, who I hadn't talked to for 2 months. He left us a long time ago but we talk with each other only to keep us informed about or lives. Pretty much see if we are doing ok.\n\n\nThe first thing he asks is if I can lend him some money. I decided to cut connections with him instatly.\n\n\nNext, a girl, my best friend from high school. Same thing. She wanted some money.\n\n\nTold a few friends about it. They were also asking me for money.\n\n\nThat's when I decided to not tell anybody about it. I just dissapeared from my home. From everyone's lives.\n\n\nFast forward a few months. I've improved. A lot.\n\n\nI've come from only working 2-3 days a week to working 6 days. Everyone at work talks to me. Chefs trust me with doing food running. Servers trust me a lot. Managers often let me take the VIP zone by myself and I'm planning on doing another job at a restaurant part-time so I could've more money. I'm making 10 times or more money that I was doing before but I've come to a point where I just want more.\n\n\nBack o my personal life. I haven't divorced yet from my wife. We've stopped fighting already. Sometimes I do video-call to see my baby but he doesn't seem to recognize me anymore.\n\n\nMe and my wife have a better relationship but I started questioning myself wether I really love her or if I just miss the memories I have with her. How she left me when I needed her the most and how things got better as soon as I had more money.\n\n\nThen, there's this girl at work. One of the sisters.\n\n\nI started developing a crush for this girl. We spend a lot of time together. She has given me hints that she has a crush on me and people often tell me about it. She is also a hard worker. She works 2 jobs and still goes to school, however, her parents help her with expenses.\n\n\nBut I respect my wedding vows, even if I don't love my wife like I did before. Or if I haven't seen her in more than 8 months. I'm still married. My mother was cheated on 4 times and I swore I wouldn't do such a thing to any woman.\n\n\nBack to this girl at work. She told me not too long ago that she had earned quite a big amount of money and asked me if I had something earned.\n\n\nI told her I had nothing, used my kid and my wife (She knows I'm married but that I don't love her) as an excuse.\n\n\nThat's when I questioned myself: What have I been doing with my life? I've been spending in videogames ONLY. I haven't even bought a car. So I started earning money. I plan on buying a car and then a house. Soon I'll get another job and will continue paying the house. Hopefully I can buy a decent house for myself and pay it in 5-10 years.\n\n\n\nLife wasn't kind to me. But it gave me a second chance. And I plan to take advantage of it.\n\nSorry for the long read. If you made it to the bottom, I truly appreciate it.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Angry because he was probably driving like a maniac. Angry about where he was in his life. And I'm angry at my parents and friends, too.

He reduced me and my parents to tears several times between when he was 15 and up until his death.

She's outlived so many friends and family.

That I would be prepared for when that time came. But any time something has happened to her I find myself a mess, worried sick about her. Not prepared to say goodbye. \n\nAnd now I'm just sitting here, waiting for updates. Unable to be there. Not knowing if I'm going to get to see her again. Or if I do, knowing that this cycle will just repeat itself. That at her age it's like living on borrowed time.

He's been very angry and not acting like himself. He's admitted that he's upset I didn't step up and be the strong one when he was at his weakest. He's right, I was a mess and not very supportive in those first few days. I have apologized many times over and I'm doing my best now, but I know I can't make up for that. I'm there to listen when he wants to talk but he just seems like he's out to prove something. I don't know what to do for him most of the time except stay out of his way.\n\nFirst, he swears all the time. Previously he would occasionally let one slip if he hurt himself or was stuck in traffic. If the kids heard he would apologize. Now he openly swears for any reason in front of the kids and doesn't care.\n\nHe has started drinking more. We've never been big drinkers, maybe some wine for our anniversary once a year. But he bought a case of beer and he'll drink 2 or 3 in the evenings. I know that's not a lot but it's so out of character for him. We've been together almost 15 years and he's never kept beer in the house.\n\nHe's very impatient with the kids. They both have emotional/behavior issues and they can be difficult and exhausting, but usually he is the \"nice\" one compared to me. Now he will shout at them or storm off for the smallest thing they do to irritate him. I know they also miss their grandpa and it's affected their moods too, but he has zero patience for it.\n\nAlso he's been acting out sexually. He will text me graphic things he wants to do and get upset if I don't reply quick enough or how he wanted. It's like he's testing me and I get it wrong. Yesterday we were watching TV after the kids were asleep and I glanced over and his dick was out. I don't know how long he was waiting for me to notice but apparently I didn't react the way he hoped so he got mad and pouty. When we are intimate he is rougher than usual. He left a bunch of hickeys all over my shoulders, neck, and nearly up to my chin so I can't hide them. It's like he wants people to notice.\n\nI'm afraid it's going to start affecting his job. The other day at work he threw his laptop. It didn't break, but I don't know if anyone saw or if he'll get in trouble.\n\nWe talked about him seeing a therapist and he knows he needs to talk to someone.

It hurts too much to hold it in. \n\nEleven months ago my big brother died from a heart attack. He had 8 years on me. He pretty much raised me. He showed me that hard work paid off. He started as a dishwasher and ended up the kitchen manager at the restaurant he worked at before he died. He showed me that it was possible to get clean off of drugs. He was a stand up guy who was willing to do anything to make sure his two little boys were happy...even when that meant letting his ex wife and new boyfriend live at their house with him. All he cared about was giving those two kids the life we didn't have access to when we were growing up.\n\nTwo days after Thanksgiving he had his heart attack. We were all shocked. I remember my little brother calling me and telling me what happened. I thought he was messing with me. When I realized he was serious, I dropped everything and went back home for a week or so. I live three hours from my family, sometimes it feels like a lot further than that.  I think it hit my mom, dad, and brother quicker than it did me. I was so caught up in being there for everyone else that I wasn't processing it myself. That's been my only real coping mechanism for the last eleven months. I always put everyone else's problems before my own. My dad was full of regret. My mom was so sad all the time. My little brother was so angry. Me? I didn't really know. I didn't think about it much. I guess it came out at night. When it became quiet. Everyone asleep. It gave me time to do my best to process things. I worried about my brother a lot, I was always there to guide him, but this was our first death this close. I was lost too.\n\nFast forward seven months later. I wake up to my phone going off early in the morning. It's my little brother's best friend. He asks me for my mom's phone number and says he has to go to the police station because something happened to my little brother. My first thought was he got a D.W.I. My mind quickly jumped to it was possible he was dead. The cops didn't tell his friend what happened, just that he needed to get down to the station. He called me back an hour later and told me what happened. My little brother died in a motorcycle accident the night before. He had been out drinking that night and hit a telephone pole. \n\nMy best friend had just died. We were 3 years apart. We did everything together. Until I moved away years ago. He hated that I did, but I had to. It was the only way for me to get clean off drugs. I still feel so guilty for (as he would say) abandoning him. We talked constantly though. Texting, Face timing, playing video games online together. Any time I went back home, he was the first person I always saw.\n\nI was lost before, now just empty. Any energy I can muster up is just anger now. We had a closed casket, but I was able to see him a few days early. I hoped it would give me closure and accept what had happened because I really didn't believe it deep down. Seeing him didn't do either of those things. It looked nothing like him. It wasn't him, it couldn't be. But it was, and I told him what a ****ing idiot he was for doing this to us. My family had no idea what to do. I stayed home for a few weeks this time and did my best to be there for everyone again. Over 300 people showed up for my little brothers funeral. I've never gotten so many hugs in my life. There was so much support for my dad, mom, and me. I saw so many old friends that I hadn't seen in years. So many, \"I'm here for you\", and so many \"If there's anything I can do\". It was the turnout he deserved, but I was relieved when it was over. \n\nAfter my little brother died, I stopped opening up to people. I haven't talked to my girlfriend of six years about it at all. I don't talk about it at work. I don't talk to my family about what's going on with me. I've completely shut down. I have one friend back home who I used to be able to talk to but she has her own stuff going on right now even if I could tell her. I'm so ****ing depressed. I've been fighting that for the last 14 years. I was suicidal at times, but after seeing what my brothers deaths have done to my family, I could never do that to them. No matter how bad it got. It should have been me. I'd trade my life for either of theirs without thinking twice. Now I feel trapped. \n\nI've been afraid to reach out for help. I work in the mental health field and I don't want to show that I'm struggling. I fear that if I do, I'd be deemed unfit to help anyone else. That's the only thing keeping me going. When I'm helping others get through stuff, it takes my mind away from what's going on with me. The only help I'm getting is through a writing group I attend, were I vaguely open up about in the writings I share. This writing group is at my place of employment, so I feel like I can't get into it too deep. \n\nI told myself I'd stay strong until I felt like my family was doing okay. I think I've gotten there. It's my turn. I need help. I've never said most of this stuff. I'm wondering what all of you do to get through it. Maybe another online support group, activities, I don't know.

I don't know what I'm going to do about school.", "author": "somlem", "self_text": "*A lot of this is me rambling. I'm sorry. There's a TLDR at the bottom. I appreciate all suggestions. Thank you.*\n\nHi. As you've read from the title, I need some help with advice on online schooling. My dad passed away a few weeks ago. He was my best friend. We played golf together all the time. We spent so much time together and I loved him soooo much. He was the funniest, the bravest, the most optimistic, and most supportive man I've ever met and ever will meet. He was a police sergeant. I've never been closer to anyone. This is probably the worst thing that will ever happen to me. My mom is completely ruined. My mom and dad were incredibly close and had the most loving relationship. It was definitely the ideal relationship that anyone would want to have. I've lived a very cushy and happy life until now. I've been unable to do anything but cry and space out during every waking moment. I live in the US, and I'm in 11th grade (or grade 11). This fucking post is written so terribly. I'm sorry. I'm pretty out of it. Anyway, the Monday following his passing, I went to school, thinking that getting back into my routine would help distract me from my pain. I was wrong. Very wrong. My dad was one of my only friends, but I was looking forward to at least seeing some of my acquaintances. I walked into school and immediately people started avoiding my eye contact and trying to catch glimpses of me. Everyone seemed to know, yet everyone also was attempting to act like it never happened. Either that, or people wouldn't stop asking me what happened. Fuck. It was a traumatic experience for me, and I have certain triggers that remind me of that morning when it happened. My friends just didn't seem to know what the hell was appropriate to say. It's not that they were trying to be nice, it's that they were just ignorant. My friends were joking about PTSD right in front of me. Some girl told me that she wished that she was traumatized because she'd like the attention. FUCK. I couldn't do this. I knew I couldn't. I have ADHD, so focusing is pretty difficult for me. My grades are low B's to high D's on a good quarter. I really wish I were exaggerating. I'm not on meds because they screw with me pretty badly. That alone is hard enough. It was IMPOSSIBLE to concentrate on ANYTHING. My teachers were giddy to catch me up on the work I'd missed in the two weeks I'd been gone. Eventually I had my Grandpa pick me up around lunch. I began to realize that although this loss might get easier to deal with, I wouldn't be okay for a while. I've already completed one quarter of my Junior year, so I thought I could maybe just finish out this semester online. I talked to my school consoler about it, but she told me that I'd have to start over all of Junior year, and that I didn't have the option to only stay online till the end of the first semester. I'd have to complete the entirety of  Junior year online. Also, my dad was the one who worked. I have multiple siblings who are the same age as me, so my mom is pretty damn busy. We don't have a source of income anymore (as far as I know) so money is really tight right now. (I do have a good support system, my dad's whole workplace is helping us through it, and my mom's family is practically living with us now. It's awesome to have them in my life &lt;3 I'm very very lucky for that.) I'm sorry. I know that this post is long and dragging. I was just wondering if anyone had any suggestions on what I could do as a substitute for school. I'll take any suggestions. I really appreciate it. :)\n\n**TLDR: (A lot of this post is me getting a bit of school anxiety stress off of my chest.) My dad passed away and I'm absolutely distraught. School is a huge obstacle for me right now and I can hardly wrap my head around how I'm going to complete a full day of school, let alone the rest of my junior year. I'm looking for other options on how to complete junior year without maybe going to school. I'm open to all suggestions. Thanks!**", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I can confidently tell you that it does not get easier, you just get better at dealing with how hard it is. \n\nI\u2019ll never know where it went wrong for you and I\u2019ll never get the chance to tell you how much you meant to me. I feel cheated that I only got 23 years with you. It's becoming more and more difficult as I realize how permanent the loss is and how much more time I will spend without you. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen our father is gone it feels, not like the audience is missing a member, but the whole audience is gone.\u201d", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I (38) and my three siblings and extended family were all devastated, not to mention both my mom's parents are still with us! I'm happy she is no longer suffering and we as a family can heal and support each other.\nWe were all concerned about my dad. He was of course beside himself after she died and visibly heartbroken. I live in another country, but my 3 brothers had a plan to make sure he would never be alone on the weekends.\nWe were all shocked when he shared 3 months after my mom's death that he was dating.\nI personally was happy for him, but the rest of my family just refused to accept it. I tried to be the bridge, and a year after my mom's death I got married and invited her to one of the weddings (the one without my grandparents).\nMy dad and his girlfriend are inseparable which makes it hard on my brothers that live close to him. My dad on his part has distanced himself and makes minimal effort to spend time with the family.\nI am flying back this weekend to celebrate my grandparents 70th anniversary!\nMy dad just sent a message in our family text that THEY have some news to share with us when we're all together.\nHonestly, my first reaction was to cry. I'm happy for my dad that he found a relationship so quickly... but as a family we just aren't ready for THIS kind of change.\nMy only hope is that the announcement is that they ALREADY got married just so we don't have wedding drama... mine was enough!", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My mother died when I was still in high school. I was 15 at the time and now I\u2019m 19.\n\nI don\u2019t feel any better. I still feel haunted. She killed herself. And I found her.\n\nOn November 19, 2015, I came home around 7:30 AM from my Grandfathers. It was a school morning and I needed clothes and meds. I was at my grandfather\u2019s the night before because my Mom was drunk and started throwing unwinnable arguments at me. I left. This would be the last time I ever saw her.\n\nUpon my return, I immediately noticed something was off.. she wasn\u2019t sleeping in the living room. My Mom was strange. She had a master bedroom, but never used it. Every night she slept in the living room. \n\nHowever, she wasn\u2019t there this morning. This caught my attention, but I brushed off my concerns, assuming she had a rough night too and maybe the comfier upstairs bed would be a better sleep.\n\nI grabbed my meds from the kitchen, but my discomfort grew. I had to find where my mother went, so I went to the upstairs bedroom to find her.\n\nI was stopped at the foot of the stairs.. confronted with the last thing I wanted to see.\n\nMy mother. Half way up the stairs. Hanging from the ceiling, a yellow extension cord wrapped around her neck, pinched in the doorway around the upstairs hall.\n\nI couldn\u2019t cry, I couldn\u2019t scream. I stared fearfully. Letting this nightmare inducing image be permanently burned into my brain. To continue to terrorize me for the rest of my life.\n\nI couldn\u2019t wrap my head around what I was seeing. I ran out to the car to my Grandpa. Telling him something was wrong and begging him to come inside. I don\u2019t know what else to tell him. He begrudgingly pulled himself out of the car and made his way inside.\n\nWhen he entered that house it was the first time I saw my burly biker grandfather completely break down. Exploding into screams and tears.\nHis 36 year old daughter was dead.\n\nI can still feel in my palms now how cold her skin felt when the police operator asked us to get her down. This was the first I had touched a dead body and I can still feel waves of sensory discomfort.\n\nThe pain is still so immense. 4 years have almost passed and it still feels like this happened a week ago.\n\nI want out of this never ending horror cycle. I don\u2019t want to live having to see her lifeless body in my head every day.\n\nI can\u2019t handle the guilt that the last interaction I ever had with my mother was a shouting match. No I love you, no goodbye.\n\nI don\u2019t feel like a good person. I feel like I want to die. I feel like I deserve to die.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My father in 2015, it was cancer, he was ill for 4 months. \nBecause of certain situations in my life I delayed both grieving times. I kept pushing it to one side because I was trying to deal with other life problems. It's now almost 2020. This grief is torture, on top of that my partner left me. Theirs this real Grief of losing my my parents on top of this other grief or losing the man I loved. Grieving for for someone who's dead and grieving for someone who is still alive has my mind fucked. I feel like I'm losing touch with reality and this pain is just almost unbearable. I moved to my boyfriend, I live in his County, he moved out and left me. I am now unemployed, isolated, depressed beyond belief and now feeling guilty that I am grieving for the wrong thing. I'm 36. My mother was diagnosed when I was 14 with MS. My life was turned upside down and since has been a massive battle with emotions. I am incredibly lonely, lost and never felt so alone..
