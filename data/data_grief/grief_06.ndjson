She was the best dog anyone could ask for. She was loving, kind, and obedient. She was patient, tolerant, and oh so protective of our family. She was with me when I was a selfish mid 20s college student and I had no one else. She was with me when I accidentally got pregnant. She stood by me as I turned from that selfish, independent girl into a selfless wife and mother. She was the first one to greet us when I brought my daughter home and again 2 years later when I brought my son home. 6 weeks ago, my mom lost her pug from liver failure. That pug was my girl\u2019s baby. They adored each other for 11 years. My girl just never recovered. Her heart was broken. \nShe got very sick the night before she died. She was vomiting a lot and couldn\u2019t sleep. We spent the entire night together in the living room. That day, she was very lethargic and not interested in food, but was still drinking. Because she still accepted water, her vet advised me to keep an eye on her for the rest of the day and night and to call him in the morning. She was very old for her size (pit/rot/chow, 90lbs). We knew her time was coming. She developed arthritis in her hips a few years ago and she was on prednisone daily for the pain. The morning before she passed, I had this overwhelmingly awful feeling, but she hated going to the vet and I refused to make what I knew in my heart to be her last days stressful by taking her there. Had she been suffering, I would have. But she wasn\u2019t in any additional pain. Just terribly weak. That night, I made a bed on the floor next to hers. I wanted to be as close as I could be in case she needed an emergency vet visit overnight. She had refused to sleep at all that day. She finally fell asleep around midnight. I was able to sleep a little then too. Around 130, I woke up suddenly. I felt something was wrong. I started to lightly pet my girl and tell her how amazing she was and how much I loved her. She didn\u2019t wake up. Her breathing was rough. I just kept petting her and telling all the ways she made my life wonderful. Her breathing started to slow around 140. At 158, she took her last breath. \nThe pain is suffocating. I know a lot of people will feel that she was just a dog. But, not to me. She was such a big and important part of my family. \nI miss you Saedy Bear. I love you so, so much. Wait for me baby. I will see you again.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I taught him basic commands that he can do flawlessly. He always play with my other dog named Stitch. They play this rough game and they chase each other. Stitch was a 5 year old miniature pinscher. He was aggressive and territorial to the other dogs but not to his owner. But when Knot came, he became friends with him since day zero. They play always. They sleep together. They do business together. Knot also tried to play with our pure white cat named Sew. I caught him getting chased by her. He was really cheerful. He brought this happy bright life to our home.\n\nBut accidents happen. Last night when he placed his paws on the couch's edge,(he usually do this so that I can pick him up and stay on the couch with me) he accidentally fell backwards. He was perhaps spooked by Stitch leaping away. He hit his head at the coffee table and whined a lot. Moments later, I saw Stitch acting scared and anxious. I looked for Knot. There he was... Blood coming out from his nose. I immediately put ice on his snout. It stopped bleeding... But his breathing was no way okay. Pet clinics here are not 24 hours so I nursed him and stayed with him as long as I can. His breathing goes on and on. I let him sleep on my bed but I knew these breathing difficulties would wake him up.\n\nThe next morning, I was woken up by sister. She said that he coughed out his food intake.

And found her lying on the floor. My husband pushed me out of the room while I wailed and ran outside. He thought he felt a slight pulse but EMT's were unable to bring her back. She was  all I had. My mother, her daughter, died when I was two. And her husband died 10 years ago. She was practically my mother. \n\nTo make matters worse, the morning of the funeral the Funeral Home Director pulled me into a room and told me my worst fear. She had a severely broken leg when he got her. He sent her an hour away to be looked at by a Medical Examiner. He said she probably fell and broke her leg and laid there until a blood clot reached her heart. \n\nTo know she suffered in her last moments is making it hard for me to get over it. I was her only grandchild, and although I did check on her earlier that day, I feel guilty for not being there. \n\nTried to contact a therapist but they keep giving me the run around. Then two week after she died my father in law died. Had the worst May ever and I'm trying my hardest to stay strong for my kids but it's becoming harder everyday. My whole purpose of being here was for her and now shes gone.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

We clicked right away over just about everything- shared sense of humor, love for punk music, passion for learning and human connection. We were always friends, but never knew each other deeply until very recently. He was privately going through a divorce [his 3rd one since I\u2019ve known him]. I reached out and after getting no response most of the time, he finally replied and poured his broken heart out to me. I told me how lonely he was, how lonely he has become, how comforting it was to have one another to confide in. He mentioned 2 recent suicide attempts as well as being severally ill physically. We talked all day every day this last month. We hung out one Tuesday night, stayed up til the sun came up-mostly just catching up, laughing, holding hands and making plans to travel next month together. He left his coat and kept changing the subject when I mentioned getting it back to him. We shared an immense bond suddenly &amp;amp; I had faith that he was wanting to heal finally. We bonded over a shared sadness &amp;amp; agreed to be a shoulder of support for one another. 2 days later, he texted me simply \u201cthank you for always being so kind to me.\u201d He then told me he was having a horrible night and drinking heavily. I told him how I\u2019m here for him always and to please talk to me about what he\u2019s feeling. I was working, but would have gone over there if I could. He never responded and was dead that same night. To my knowledge, I was the last person to see or speak to him.

We didn\u2019t know that the house was on fire until our neighbors came and banged on the door. The fire was put out quickly but not before some damage was made. There is now a huge hole in the side of the house that is currently boarded up with plywood. We were able to get two of the three cats out of the house before the fire department showed up and shoved them in my car. The third cat is very skittish and terrified of everything. She obviously bolted when the battery back up exploded and she was in the house the entire time the fire department was there. We did find her alive and well but she does stink to high heaven. We will have to give her a bath. The insurance adjuster believes the electrical in the house has been compromised and things it might need to be gutted and rewired. \n\nWe will be unable to stay at our house for probably 6 months. We are currently in a hotel.\n\nI am grateful for the neighbors that jumped into action immediately and called 911.

After a while maybe weeks, maybe months, you\u2019ll find the waves are still 100 feet tall but they come further apart. When they come they still crash all over you and wipe you out, but in between you can breath, you can function. You never know what\u2019s going to trigger the grief. It might a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything... and the wave comes crashing. But in between the waves, there is life. Somewhere down the line and it\u2019s different for everybody, you find the waves are only 80 feet tall or 50 feet tall. And while they still come they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday or Christmas. You can see it coming for the most part, and prepare yourself and when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side.

First he was a regular at the bar where I work and we didn't really speak much unless I was there to grab drinks for a table. Soon after, his friend C started working with me, and then he was known to me as C's friend Chris. Next thing I knew, he was gifting me a bottle of Jack Honey at my birthday party and I knew we were going to be great friends forever.\n\nWhen tragedy struck the 3rd part of their Trio and took the life of their beloved Danielle, I worried neither would recover. I did not have the privilege of getting to know her well, but in the brief time I spent with her I knew she was just as wonderful as the other two. This story, however, is not about her passing.\n\nAfter her death Chris and I talked more, and he would tell me stories about their Trio and reminisce about their friendship. Things were different now though. He was still the same smiley, charming ball of energy but he seemed haunted. Friends began to notice his alcohol intake had raised exponentially and his behavior while intoxicated was uncharacteristically irritable. It didn't take much time before concern from all his loved ones seemed to help and he started getting back on track.\n\nThe last time I saw Christopher was a week ago today. He had come in to visit and I was managing the restaurant that day. He hugged me tightly like he always did and we chatted for a bit before Danielle was brought up and it caught the attention of another man at the bar. We learned his wife had just miscarried twins at 7 months along but he was being sent somewhere else for work. At this point in time I had to excuse myself so I could finish a time sensitive task and I told him I would be back, but by the time I was done he and the man had left. I was bummed but knew we'd catch up later.\n\nThe next day was a busy one as my mother and I had a camping trip on the Kennebec River in Maine for two nights. Cell service was nonexistent but there was free wifi at the campground lodge. That night my mom and I got eaten by mosquitoes, made smores, an listened to a pair of owls have a conversation in the trees above us.\n\nThe following morning we went to the lodge for breakfast and I had a notification about being tagged in a picture. I approved the photo from my birthday, put my phone down and went about eating breakfast. When it was getting close to bill time I wasn't sure if cash or card was better so I decided to check my bank account. Unlocking my phone refreshed Facebook and I was met with devastating news.\n\nChris was killed in a car accident returning home from Manchester just hours after he left my place of work that day.\n\nThis couldn't be real. I spent the rest of the trip half numb, and half in tears, but fully in disbelief.  This couldn't be real. I had just hugged him and spoken to him the day before. This couldn't be real. I knew I wasn't ready to go home. Home meant friends. Home meant reality. This couldn't be real.\n\nReality struck when I walked into my first shift back and was damn near tackled with a hug by the least affectionate  friend within our circle, BW. I hugged her back and could feel my heart breaking. My friends were all hurting again, and this time I was truly hurting with them.\n\nLast night at the wake even the toughest of my male friends broke down in tears and I saw C say goodbye to the last of her Trio. My unaffectionate friend BW held my hand when we approached his casket and we cried together. Christopher's mother welcomed all of us with love and I could see where he got his strong, kind heart. There were hardly any dry eyes out of the hundreds who came. He was loved more than I think he could've imagined.\n\nToday nothing is okay. I'm angry and I don't understand how these accidents just happen and we're all left without  that last chance. How are we to move forward from such a loss? No promise of afterlife, reincarnation, or star dust will erase the raw sorrow in my soul. I buried my friend today and he'll never know how sorry I am that I didn't come back in time to say goodbye.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He encouraged me to pursue the things I wanted while taking care of myself.

Though, I went to prom my senior year, and he went with his girlfriend, who was also a senior. I ended up running into him at prom and having a small conversation with him. I don't remember most of it honestly. But I remember what I said to him last. \"I'll hit you up soon.\" I never did. He was taken from us suddenly May 6th 2018. This was about a month after prom. I found out the day after from facebook. When I read it, it didn't seem real. not James. hes too careful. but it happened. A sleep deprived FedEx semi truck driver fell asleep at the wheel and smashed into the traffic stopped due to road work. James was killed instantly and was thankfully the only fatality to occur that day. His girlfriend, who he had in the car that day, was injured but survived the near fatal experience. When they held the funeral, nearly half the town showed up. He loved superheroes, so his closest friends stood up in respect and showed off their individual heros.

I believe I never met anyone as good, and will never meet anyone as good and will never meet anyone as good to me. They were incredibly loving and kind individuals who just happened to be in my life. I wish I could be more like them. It's been years and I still feel lost without them. I know they were imperfect but in my mind, I can't help seeing them as sort of like saints. I don't know how to accept that other people in my life can be as loving towards me in their own way. I feel so alone without them. It bothers me greatly that I can't speak with them. Emotionally, I take their deaths as a personal insult to myself although I know that's so wrong. Can anyone give any suggestions about coping more effectively with this?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

We didn't intend to start one, but we met through a video game and just clicked. We had never met in person, but still managed to share our lives in every way possible but physically. To be honest, he was on parole and couldn't leave his state, and we couldn't afford for me to visit him where he lived. Six months ago, we decided that he was going to move here when he was finally free. He said he was starting a new chapter of his life, and he wanted it to be a better life than he had, and he couldn't imagine having a happier life than one spent with me.\n\nThree weeks ago, he moved across the country to be with me. I picked him up from the bus station. We had a fantastic night. I told my mom that I expected to be nervous, but it was like all my fears and insecurities drained away as soon as I saw him smile. He wasn't feel well the next day. Who would after 48 hours on a bus, right? He had a sore throat and couch. Traveler's crud, we figured. So we just relaxed - watched movies and played video games - and I took care of him. When we were going to bed, I said that maybe it was crappy to say since he wasn't feeling good, but I'd had a great day. He said it was the best and told me he was so glad I came into his life. He added, \"you really are perfect.\" I started laughing and said, \"I think we both know I'm FAR from perfect.\" He kissed me and said, \"Nit today, baby. Today you were perfect.\" I've never felt so loved and cherished as I did in that moment. To finally be with him and feel my love accepted and returned was truly beautiful.\n\nHe had difficulty sleeping that night because he was coughing so bad. He moved to the couch early in the morning. Told me to go back to sleep. He said I'd taken such good care of him during the night he wanted me to get a couple of uninterrupted hours of sleep. I put some hot tea on for him when I got up. He said, \"You take such good care of me, baby. You really are the best.\" He told me he loved me, gave me a kiss. When his tea was ready, I brought it to him. Told him it was cool enough to drink. He sat up to grab it from the coffee table and then he just slumped over. He wasn't breathing and I couldn't find a pulse. I called 911 and did CPR until they got there, but he was just gone. Nothing they did could bring him back. The EMTs called it \"sudden and unexpected heart failure.\" The doctors at the hospital he was taken to said it looked like congestive heart failure.\n\nHe was my love, my best friend, and my anchor. I was blessed to have the time I had with him, to show him how much I loved him and to feel how loved I was as well. We had 2 years to share our lives and only 2 days to share our touch. I'm trying not to fall apart, but I miss him so much and I'm surrounded by reminders of the memories I wanted to make with him but never had the chance to.

He came into my life at 3 months. Nothing but wrinkles, giant paws, and love at that point. Love at first sight fucking exists beyond any doubt. As far as basset hounds go, he wasn\u2019t old but he was a giant (75 lbs.). He wasn\u2019t overweight, this dog was just ginormous. Imagine animating a basset hound digitally and then thinking to yourself, \u201cnah bro, I\u2019m gonna increase the ratio/scale\u201d. (I\u2019ll show anyone disputing this fact the receipts [in form of pictures])\n\nOne day, he took a tumble whilst out on one of our morning walks and then it all went downhill from there. At the vets, the x-rays showed what appeared to be a herniated disc. He was given steroids, pain relievers, we fucking tried fucking acupuncture, and I thought he was going to heal. Two weeks later, we had to increase the dosage. Three days after that, he couldn\u2019t walk and he whimpered every other breath he took. Bob was only ill for three weeks but I looked at him and I couldn\u2019t let him continue to suffer for my own comfort. I showed him my love until his last breath, and I took comfort in the fact that I gave him the best life I could and that he knew he was loved. My baby had such a great life and at that, quality of life, that I couldn\u2019t imagine him continuing on in pain. It was his time. I wish I could say that I hate to say, his absence has been debilitating. My life revolved around my buddy, so much so that I had never really imagined a world without him, and now it feels as though I\u2019m traversing a world where I\u2019ve suddenly become absent of all senses.

Any advice, ideas, words of wisdom is welcome.", "author": "k_blind17", "self_text": "\n\nHey there. Looking for advice from anyone really- but definitely nannies, former nannies, and parents out there. \n\nI (33F) started working for a family back in 2011, their son was 4 and their daughter was nearly 1 when the job began. I had been a part time nanny, teacher, and coach for years leading up to this position, but this family became my first true full- time, long-term family. (55-60hrs/week, 4.5 years). And it was an incredible experience. \n\nMy bosses were (still are) absolutely amazing, the kiddos were  a blast and I adored them and the time we shared learning and growing together over the years. Even their extended family, friends, and local community were just so accepting and loving toward me. I poured so much of myself into this position, they sort of became more my family than my own, and since their extended family lived so far away, they relied heavily on me, but also cared and were always supportive of me in return. \n\nWe had our ups and downs, within the \u201cjob\u201d and outside of it within our own personal lives, but we all worked together as a team to help raise 2 of the best kids I\u2019ve ever known. \n\nAfter nearly 5 years, when the little one was going to enter kindergarten, we reached that dreaded point in a perfect situation where we realized we couldn\u2019t stick together. They needed a part time sitter, and I needed a full time job- so we parted ways at the end of 2015. It was heartbreaking, and awkward, and we each went through a bit of grief and anger after the end, but we eventually found a way to stay in touch and see each other quite a lot. \n\nThe next family I worked for happened to live in the same town as them so I would visit the kids of my former family a lot, go to their sports games or practices after work, go over and have dinner with the family, I was included in birthday parties, I\u2019d  babysit for them on weekends, and visit for holidays sometimes. We remained in touch all these years, and instead of my former bosses being former bosses, they became friends, Good ones, the kind that show up to your fathers funeral,  or invite you to special events that didn\u2019t even include the kids, etc. \n\nWe saw each other monthly, communicated weekly, one way or another and I really looked forward to every moment with them. Needless to say, they are a huge part of my life, and I think I\u2019m a pretty big part of theirs. \n\nA little over a month ago I received a phone call that has since changed me in ways I cannot even express yet. A family friend of my former bosses reached out to let me know that the little girl I nannied from infancy to kindergarten was in the hospital fighting for her life after a brain hemorrhage. I rushed to the hospital and spent 2 days hoping, praying, crying, wishing, supporting, and just existing in a space with this family, and their closest friends. \n\nSadly, after she fought quite the battle, they came to terms with the fact she could not be saved, and decided to let her go. The devastation is surreal, for all of us. \n\nEven though I no longer work for them, or live or work in their town, my boyfriend and I are a huge part of their lives, and they very kindly included us in their private family funeral- and the mom kept saying to me in the hospital and during the funeral that I\u2019m like their big sister and I should be sitting in the front row. Which is a massive honor, but also has made this loss even more challenging to process. \n\nI am no stranger to grief and loss. I lost my best friend at 17, my dad 3 years ago, which both altered my life in every way possible. And since I come from a large family, I\u2019ve lost countless others, and will continue to do so. \n\nBut...\n\nFor whatever reason, maybe because she was only 8 and it happened so suddenly, maybe because I feel I\u2019m grieving on an island, since I\u2019m not actually a part of their family, or their daily life in recent years, or maybe because of the guilt of leaving them 3 years ago, I am absolutely crippled by this loss. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to say or do to help my former bosses, and their now only child. I have always been able to rationalize other losses in my life, I have always understood why someone was \u201ctaken too soon\u201d, but this one is just unbelievably heartbreaking and I am not handling it well. \n\nThe first 2-3 weeks,  I did my best. I showed up and took their son out and about to provide him with the distractions he craved, while giving my former bosses some much needed alone time. I\u2019ve had dinner with them, sat around with them and chatted about some wonderful memories we\u2019ve all shared, etc. but nothing feels like it\u2019s enough. \n\nTheir entire community has been absolutely brilliant in honoring their daughter, and providing support, but almost to a point where I feel it\u2019s overwhelming them. They did have a nanny at the time they lost their daughter, but since their son is a bit older, I\u2019m not sure she will stay on with them. Everything is a bit up in the air at the moment for them I suppose, and they have been incredibly strong, brave, and resilient through this entire month. \n\nI want to continue to be a part of their lives, even more so for their son who I really do see as a sort of little brother. I guess my reason for posting is half venting, half asking what you guys would do in this awful scenario.\n\nI\u2019m looking to see if their is another nanny out their who has worked for a family, or is currently working for a family who has lost a child, and how you managed that situation. I don\u2019t know my place, I don\u2019t want to overstep any boundaries, but I also don\u2019t want to be another person whose world keeps on turning and I become absent in their time of need for support. \n\nAnyone out there with any insight in terms of nanny life, their own personal experience with grief and loss- even if it is unrelated to the family you work(ed) for, or really just if you think you have some words of wisdom on how I can navigate this process- I would be ever so grateful. \n\n\nTL:DR - An amazing family I worked for for years and stayed in contact with recently lost their 8 year old daughter and I am looking for advice or ideas on how to help this family, and myself, during one of the most difficult moments of ours lives. \n\nThank you all in advance. \u2764\ufe0f", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Today, he was getting these random spurts of energy where he wakes up and is very alert, with both eyes open, and talks to us. Well, I was holding his hand during one of these times and he started squeezing my hand in pulses. Then he opened his eyes and looked up at something above him and said, \u201cThis is my girl here\u201d.

He had been driving home from being out all night and hit a tree. They say he was going about 80 in a 35 and died instantly. His birthday is June 15, he would have been 26.\n\nWe were together for 5 years. We had been on a break for the last year, never losing contact and trying to get our shit together so we could just be happy. It was never a question of if we wanted each other, just when and how we were going to make it work. \n\nHe is gone and I have never felt so empty. I\u2019m still in shock and when I think about the details, I feel like somebody or something is sucking the soul out of my body. I can\u2019t breathe and my body goes limp. He is the only thing that has ever made me feel important; he gave me purpose. I\u2019ve always wanted to get married and have babies, but now the thought of that makes me sick. He is the reason I wanted all of that and now neither him or I will get to share the joy of bringing beautiful babies into the world. His parents will never get to have their grandchildren...\n\nI have never imagined a life without him, we met when I was 17. I have no future. I want to be with him; I need to be with him. I can\u2019t do this. The second he lost his life, I lost mine too.\n\nUpdate (2 weeks): I\u2019ve been numb. My theory here is that my body won\u2019t let me think about what\u2019s happening because at this point, the physical harm my feelings are causing will probably kill me. It\u2019s getting worse. I found out the accident was a lot worse than I could have ever imagined which in turn, triggered dreams. I dream about him every night now and I don\u2019t sleep through the night. I wake up looking for him, thinking... Hoping he will be there. I had a dream he came back, his dad told me that the people at the funeral home had made a mistake and he was actually okay. Obviously that wasn\u2019t true, I just don\u2019t see a time where this ever sets in and becomes reality because it really does feel like one big nightmare.\n\nI think about killing myself.

Looking for advice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother passed away on Monday in California. She was a \"[locum](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/locum%20tenens)\" and she was found dead outside her apartment, walking her dog. She was still holding the leash when she was found. She was found next to a wall surrounding the apartment dumpster. No foul play suspected. She had a head injury of some kind. She must have fallen down or been tripped by the dog. Unfortunately, the police didn't clean it up, so I had to clean her blood off the concrete. I couldn't stand to see it every time we were taking things out of the apartment.  So, the issue pertaining to a service is that life insurance doesn't have a current known cause of death. We can only speculate with no witnesses. She had no prior health concerns that relate to this. She had diabetes but she walked outside all the time and did normal things like, we didn't see this coming at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy stepdad was asked to come out from his home state and sort everything out (clean apartment, sign things, etc). I didn't want to make him do that alone. We all lived in different states. I met him in my city since he had a connecting flight and we flew out together to sort it out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we got there, I kept asking him \"when are we doing a funeral, what are we going to do?\". He was too distraught and didn't know. They didn't have a ton of money saved up even though she was doing really well with her job. They had some debt they were clearing up and yes, they have some savings but she was by far the breadwinner so his income has been devastated, along with his will to continue on. I'm really worried about him. He doesn't have much family and she kept him tethered to the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like it's on him to figure out what we do. She wanted to be cremated, we know that. From what I could get out of him it sounds like there's a plot somewhere for them but no headstone. We don't feel like a huge funeral is needed because she wasn't super outgoing or anything (really quirky and adorable though) and was loved by a close few.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to honor her life in some way. He and I are back in our respective hometowns and I don't know what a good next step would be. I know that a service or a headstone won't make me feel better but I just want a place to be able to go to and mourn if I'm close. A place to sit with her. I'll get an urn with her of course but idk what's \"normal\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust wondering if anyone else has been in something similar and has any ideas. The autopsy results and toxicology results will take quite a while to come in and we can't just shell out big bucks for something that won't mean anything. She had no will left behind so we have no idea what to do. He hasn't been able to tell me what he wants and I understand that but I just feel like I should step in a little here and take the reigns. I'm distraught but I'm not destroyed yet. I feel like I have some unresolved business. Any advice is appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Grammar", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I\u2019m sure that most of you here are going through a tough time with grief, yourselves, and my heart goes out to all of you. I hope for peace for you. \n\nI feel as though I grieve in a strange way, and I was wondering if other people process this pain similarly. I\u2019m a very sensitive and emotional person, but when it comes to death of loved ones, I\u2019m a very all-or-nothing griever. For instance, my grandpa died when I started college. The hour that I found out, I felt totally numb, but after my mom left my dorm I started sobbing hysterically. After that, I felt fine again, but then at his funeral and some other random moments, I just couldn\u2019t stop sobbing. My grandpa was very nice to me, but he was really mean to my sister and my mom (and he was somewhat abusive to my dad growing up), which made it even more confusing that I grieved him so much. He died 6 years ago, but just 15 minutes ago I found a graduation card he sent me and started crying again. \n\nMy grandma also died last year. She\u2019s my dad\u2019s mom, and she and my mom had a big falling out that made it hard for me to see my grandma (my mom has borderline personality disorder, but that\u2019s a separate story). My grandma was definitely a flawed person and didn\u2019t have the greatest morals, and her husband was racist and an addict, but my grandma was a sweet and warm person, herself. I miss her, and sometimes it hits me really hard how much I miss her and wish she were still here (she died very suddenly), though most of the time I feel fine.\n\nIs there something wrong with me? I feel bad that most of the time I can carry on with my life as if nothing happened, and almost compartmentalize my grief, when I know so many people feel it constantly. My boyfriend\u2019s father committed suicide, and he tends to go numb when he feels grief as well, but I\u2019m not trying to numb myself to these feelings.

I was 16, starting my junior year, and happy to finally be in a loving relationship. But his suicide came out of nowhere and hit me like nothing else ever had.\nI guess this post is a bit about my experiences, and what anyone else who is grieving can expect (although I know it is a varying process).\nWhen it comes to suicide, there will always be some form of guilt you will feel. Like you could\u2019ve done something to prevent it. In this case, there was not one mention to me, his friends, or his family that my boyfriend had made about being depressed or suicidal. But even if someone has reached out, as long as you were by their side you should never feel like the blame is on you. Even if it\u2019s tough to hear, it was their mind telling them to do it and their action. \nAbout grieving in general, it is a crazy rollercoaster of emotion. The first few months for me were definitely the hardest, and things will most definitely fall apart. My grades fell, social life became almost nonexistent , and even self care was a challenge. That is okay, and all part of healing. For me, the best way to cope was to talk. Express my emotions as much as I can, to friends, family, and a therapist (who I still see a couple times a month). Everyone has gone through some loss, even if not as \u201cshocking\u201d as it were it my case. If people can\u2019t give advice, having their sympathy can at least reassure you you\u2019re not alone in this.\nThere were (and are) some triggers that take me back to when it first happened. Some days I\u2019ll be sobbing and sobbing uncontrollably like when I had first gotten the news. This is also okay. There isn\u2019t a set in stone time of when you\u2019re not allowed to grieve anymore. And whenever you can let out your emotions, do. Building them up inside just makes the release much more painful. \nI\u2019m 17 now and will be starting my senior year. I live on everyday hoping that I\u2019m making my boyfriend proud, by studying hard and (hopefully) making it to the college I want to go to. Even if your loved one is gone, wether it be a pet, friend, family member, significant other, etc., remember the good times and know that they\u2019ll always be watching down on you. Much love everyone.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He was 17, a month and a half away from graduating high school, and someone who meant a *lot* to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProblem is, I didn't actually know him that well. He was on the swim team with me (I was his captain), we were in AP Government and Young Democrats together at school (which was pretty fun since we were basically one of three liberal kids in a school nestled in the heart of conservative Utah), and we shared a **lot** of mutual friends, but we never talked much outside of politics, memes, and swim--and we certainly weren't hanging out on the weekends or anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, why am I taking this so hard, you ask? It's because I had a huge crush on him, and I can't help but regret not sucking up my nerves and insecurities and just actually getting to know him. The struggle with this, however, is that I'm grieving a lot for his death, but I sort of feel like it's not my place. A lot of my friends were really close with him, and so I don't really have an outlet to handle my grief because I don't feel like it's fair to them, but at the same time, I'm hurting so, so much over this. I don't know what to do, and while Reddit isn't necessarily the best place for this, I feel like I don't have anywhere else to turn to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh my god, I miss him so much. I had finally convinced myself to bolster up the courage to ask him to the last school dance of the year, and I even themed my cheesy little ask into something I knew he would get a kick out of--he had a random fascination with Richard Nixon (idk, it was weird but hilarious), so I made a fun sign that said \"I'm no Watergate, but it'd be a scandal if you didn't go to the dance with me\" with little pictures of Nixon's face glued all over the poster board. I was planning to ask him the Friday after he died, and I had prepared over a month in advance for this. I literally couldn't even look at that poster for weeks after he passed away until finally I gave it to his mom because she told me at his funeral that she wanted to have it. He was so smart and funny and just looked at the world through a brilliant lens that never failed to blow my mind. I'm scared I'm going to forget his face or, even more likely (and thus more terrifying to me), his voice--all I have is one random video with him talking in the background, and I've listened to it over and over and over again to try to hang onto any little pieces I can. I keep breaking down in my car on the weekly and I don't think a single day in the past two months have gone by where I haven't thought about him in some way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess I'm frustrated because, with other people I've lost such as my grandma or my aunt, I never really went through this. I know it really comes down to how emotionally close I felt to each person, but I guess that's why I feel so lost about how to recover from this because I don't actually have many memories with him or any real reason to feel this way. I feel silly and stupid about it all, and again, I don't have someone to turn to because I feel way too guilty.

These last few weeks, I've been in a place of joy, grieving-wise. Don't get me wrong: i'm still crying a little bit everyday, because I miss him so much. But there's more happiness than pain. I told my therapist that I felt guilty for those feelings. She said to embrace them, to enjoy them, because grieving emotions are on a swing.\n\nSo I told her about why I was feeling good.\n\nA few weeks ago, my mom asked my wife and myself to come and clean up dad's dresser and closet space, as she's unable to go on the second floor.\n\nWe were laughing at the old clothes my mom kept over the years - think pastel sweaters, weird geometric patterns, all shades of brown, you know what I'm talking about.\n\nAs I took the last sweaters out of the dresser, I found a rolled-up piece of paper.\n\nI opened it and, in front of me, a pair of drawings I made when I was 6 or 7 years old. On one side, there's a gas station, with Alvin from Alvin and the Chipmunks riding a humongous Kawasaki motorcycle...On the other, a weird looking cop car, with all flashers on.\n\nI cried-laugh a little seeing that drawing. I don't remember this one in particular, but I know that I liked drawing a lot, even though I was sooooooooobad at it. Dad would bring back unused newspaper rolls from work for me to use. \n\nI was wondering why he kept that one in particular. Especially since he was not a nostalgic, nor a hoarder of old things like that. He probably had forgotten about it too. But the thought that he kept a drawing of me is deeply touching.\n\n\\---\n\nWhen I was 19, about this time of year, I told dad that \"I wanted to show him something\". So we got into the car to go to the music store. There was this sweet Epiphone Riviera that I'd been eyeing for a while, but I was a broke student...\n\n\"Look dad...it's fantastic...Do you think you could lend me the money? \"\n\nHe looked at the price tag: 1300$. A huge amount. He told me he was tired - he just suffered a heart attack a few months prior - and that he was going in the car.\n\nI was about to say something when he stopped and told me \"Try to negotiate the price down, and I'll consider it...\"\n\nso i spoke to the shop owner. We agreed on 875$, taxes included.\n\nWent to dad, with the great news. He was already sleeping.\n\n\"875$ uh?....Still too expensive. There's dust on it, it's been sitting on the wall for almost a year now...Go get some stuff with it, a case, something...\"\n\nSo I went back into to shop and the owner and I agreed on a final price: 835, taxes included, with a case, a cord and a strap. \n\nI went back to the car and told dad.\n\n\"You did good. Let's get it.\"\n\nI promised to pay him back as soon as i got the money. He made me make sure that mom didn't see the guitar.\n\nA few months later, they come to see me play.\n\nAfter the show, dad told me \"Isn't that the guitar I bought for you?\"\n\nI had forgotten about the \"hiding the guitar from mom\" thing.\n\n\\- Yes Dad, I stammered.\n\n\\- How much did it cost?\n\n\\- I'll repay you at christmas. I'll have some gift money and will work a little bit more then.\n\n\\- Forget about it. It's ok.\n\nMore than the 835$, it was the approval, the recognition of my biggest passion, that made me happy. My dad was not super artsy or anything, but here he was telling me, without words that he believed in me, that he knew i was loving playing music.\n\n\\--\n\nOver the years, I've sold, traded and bought lots of guitars, but this old Epi Riviera always stayed with me. There's something special about it, and it's perfectly adapted to my hands, after 24 years.\n\nAfter dad's passing, i thought playing music would help dealing with the pain, but i was unable to play. I'd grab a guitar, strum a few chords and put it back on its stand.\n\nI was cleaning my desk when I came across a sheet of letter stickers. I looked over at the old Epi. I took it, cleaned up the back of the head, and stuck a big D (my dad's first name starts with a D) on it.\n\nLike the old drawing my dad kept, this guitar will never leave me.\n\nEver.\n\n\\- \n\nFor the last 6-7 weeks now, I've started enjoying playing music again. \n\nDad would probably say \"it's about time!\"\n\nLife's good, at least for now.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I wanted to you to visit China, I wanted to send you to culinary school as a retirement gift. \n\nMost importantly, I wanted to continue my relationship with you, one where I grew with you, shared my frustrations and had time to get to know you more. I know that that\u2019s not possible now. \n\nI know life has to continue as usual and people have to go about their lives but I want the world to stop for at least a second and acknowledge the loss of you. I want the world to breathe out the tremendous loss of you.\n\nYou had so much to give. You were always giving and cared so much about others and being kind in your own blunt way. You were fierce and passionate about what you believed in. You taught me to take risks, live fully and openly and to be whoever the fuck I wanted to be.\n\nWe danced in gay clubs together, you embraced who I was before I ever did. My friends loved you as much as they loved me. \n\nEven if I can work on it more, I try to be kind like you. I try to be as open as you are. Sometimes I feel like I can never achieve that goal because you are a remarkably kind, generous, and open person. I am so proud - that is so rare and difficult in a world like ours. \nYou are eccentric in the best way and different but you are brave. It\u2019s incredibly hard to be brave enough to be that open and loving. It is way easier to feel anger and distrust.\n\nI want to love the way you do - you possess a kind of spirituality that radiates love and welcoming. I want to love in that way too. \n\nBut that fragile framework is in me because of you. I know how important it is to be genuine, real and vulnerable because of you. I know what a gift it is to even cry so much - I know I got that from you. I feel and empathize and connect because of you.\nYou are like my OG example of that kind of bravery. The bravery and risk it takes to be that open. You are selfless, caring and have a talent at connecting with all kinds of people and finding what is special about them. People felt that when they were around you. I was especially lucky to feel that as your daughter. \n\nI have been thinking of all of my memories with you. The ones were we were happy, goofy and laughing together. All the little moments we had together. How much you took care of me. I read through our texts and I can\u2019t believe I won\u2019t be able to talk to you again. \n\nWho am I going to text when I think I\u2019m dying because of a rash on my skin? Who am I going to call and ask for the snickerdoodle recipe for the 20th time? Who is going to make me laugh in the same way you do?\n\nI\u2019ve been talking to you though. Sometimes, I can just only say that I love you. Sometimes I can just whimper out mom because I wanted so much better for you. Sometimes I just say, mom this is so fucked up. \n\nIt\u2019s going to be so difficult without you. I feel like a piece of me has been ripped out. But I will do my best to live to honor you. I want to spread your love and openness as much as I can. I want to be as blunt and honest as you. I want to try to laugh as hard and freely as you. \n\nThe only thing that keeps me from completely breaking down right now is that I know you are a part of me. And I was and am a part of you. I feel you with me. I know even now that you can feel how much I love you. This is not a complete goodbye - I know I will keep you alive and all of the people you have touched will keep you alive. \n\nI will feel you in the wind sometimes, I will feel you in the sunlight warming my skin. I will feel your kind of love that you instilled in me as I talk with people. I will feel you as I listen to soul music and sing along. I will taste and appreciate food the way you have taught me that feeds the soul. It seems appropriate that our last conversation was about soup. \n\nI don\u2019t know exactly what form you will take but I know you will still continue to always be there for me. I love you so much, mom.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I'm reminded every day how lucky I am to be alive and to have made it this far, some people never make it this far. She didn't. And she deserved to. She was the happiest, and most good person I've ever met. She had a glow to her and she made everyone around her so happy and loved making people laugh. I'm still so sad and it doesn't feel right talking about her in past tense. She had so much going for her in life and all I wanted was to see her grow up with the rest of us and succeed. She should be out with her friends celebrating like they did, like I did and everyone else. It hurts seeing memories from people of her a year ago, happy and living like nothing ever happened and she had no idea that her life would be stolen from her. It's still so heartbreaking to me.

I don't know if writing this will do me any good but I can't sleep and this seems like a good place to vent. (Formatting may be bad because I'm on mobile)\n\nMy boyfriend of 4 1/2 years just passed away this morning, completely unexpectedly. He was bipolar, had ADHD, a drug addict, and had just lost his car and job. He was struggling to get better, I know that me staying in a relationship like this is a stupid idea, but I really loved him and wanted to see him improve.  I put everything I had into our relationship and helping him, even though he told me it would probably end badly. Slowly he had begun to improve, but the past few months were just a nosedive as he became more depressed and addicted to various substances. \n\nIt all went to shit this morning when I came home from work to find that something had happened while he was walking the dog and that he was unconscious. I was immediately in denial and begged him to wake up while I called 911. It was too late and I knew it, but god damn it I didn't want it to be true. I didn't understand, he was fine when I left for work, smiling and happy and being affectionate, how the f*** did he end up here? This didn't last long though, as the first realization hit me and I went into a panic attack.\n\nIt's been six hours since I found him, the officers and medics have finally left, I can't stand to be in our shared apartment, my cat and dog have no clue that they'll never see their dad again and I feel like I'm to blame. At minimum, I enabled him by trying to be gentle and understanding with him rather than pressuring him to quit. In a desperate attempt to ease my conscience, I called his mother and was the one who broke the news to her. \n\nI'm currently staying with my mother, who agreed that staying in the apartment by myself would be bad for me. Now I'm lying in bed, trying to fall asleep and the waves of guilt and sadness keep coming, stronger than before and continually getting worse. I've lost my best friend and the person I loved most in the world because of a stupid mistake. I can't ever get him back and I feel hollow without him. I keep reading over our text messages and notes he wrote me, wishing I could somehow fix this. \n\nI have so many questions...\nHow could this happen?\nWhy didn't I leave him when he warned me that this could happen?\nHow much of this was my fault?\nIs there a point where this gets any easier? \nWhat's the best way to break this kind of news to our friends and family? \n\nI just really need help and don't know where to get it.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My brother and I took turns visiting them in hospital. When it was clear my Mother was not going to get any better, my brother and I brought her home to die. It was only clear to me, that should have been the first inkling to me that things were going the way they did. \n\nMy Mother died at the age of 63, way too young in my opinion. But, I am grateful that she didn't suffer long. My Father eventually recovered, I will always be thankful for that. To lose them both would have killed me too. \n\nAt my Mother's funeral, I noticed my brother talking a lot, to anyone who would listen about signs, the spirit world and other things. When I look back now there were other things preceding her death, but I was too preoccupied to notice. We returned home from the funeral and I set about preparing the house for my Father to come home. My brother would be out from the morning till late in the evening. Within a few weeks he had completely changed into someone I no longer knew. He became hostile, paranoid and aggressive. His delusions turned dark, blaming me for my Mother's death. \n\nFinally, I had him committed under the mental health act. Made no difference, he was able to get himself out of there with no problem. \n\nThe end of our time together came after my Father came home from the hospital. My father developed diabetic ketoacidosis, which can be life threatening. My brother refused to entertain calling 911 afraid of his delusion that I would have my father killed in hospital. Not willing to gamble, I called 911 and when he found out, he shoved me against the wall. When the police came, they didn't know who to believe and asked my father. My father told them his son was mentally unwell. My brother was arrested for assault. I only saw him once again at court where I had to testify. I made it clear that the brother I had before his mental illness developed would have never shoved his sister. That I just wanted him to get help.\n\nThat was almost 6 years ago. I do not know where my brother is. Don't know if he's alive or dead. In jail or if he sleeps under a roof at night. I sometimes feel that I lost them both they day my Mother died. \n\nAs a kid, he was my best friend. We were four years apart and he took me swimming in the summer and skating in the winter. One time, I forgot my hat at the rink. It was a bitterly cold walk home. He said, \"I won't have you getting sick,\" as he gave me his hat. He got some frostbite instead. \n\nWhen the social worker told us our mother had died in the hour we left the emergency room, he held me as I cried. He picked me up. \n\nI dream of him sometimes. Nightmares that he tries to kill me. Better dreams where he finds us, completely restored into the brother I had and lost. \n\nThe other night, I dreamt he found me. He told me not to be afraid. I took him to my sisters house, where he met the long awaited niece after 3 nephews. He adored her like we knew he would. \n\nMaybe we meet in that dream place. \n\nThere's a part of me that waits for the knock on the door to tell me he died. My cousin who was his twin was murdered in 2015. I looked into the casket and seen my brother laying there, his face and his body beaten and bruised. I barely made it outside the church before I threw up. For who, I'm not certain. \n\nI look for my brother in crowds, half hoping, half terrified that I'll see him. Not knowing which version of him I would meet.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I can't comprehend within myself how people are able to greatly love multiple people- siblings, two parents, in-laws, etc. But in order to move forward and find love again- I know I will likely have to learn to love this way. But I honestly don't know how. I try to imagine/fantasize myself one day with a child, a daughter/son-in-law, and having grandkids to dote on. It might sound silly?? but I can't picture it and there is a lot of internal conflict and even heartbreak when I think about it. And it's also hard to know that I will likely never have someone again that loves me with such intensity as my mom, and only me. I'm at a loss and don't know how to move forward in life.

She has a history of osteoporosis and so this accident was absolutely devastating to her body. Neck broken, back broken, arm broken, 4 ribs broken bilaterally and her pelvis was entirely detached from her spine as well as a pretty severe brain bleed. She was having difficulty breathing in the ER and her pressure was bottoming so she was intubated and sedated to give her body time to rest. I didn\u2019t get to the hospital to see her before they sedated her. \n\nShe had 4 surgeries. First the stabilize her pelvis and she pulled through. Next she was given a trach. And she pulled through. Then given a gtube. And she pulled through. Then they fixed her arm... and she pulled through. The weaned her off her sedatives and decreased her pain meds in hopes of waking her but she never really did wake up. She would open her eyes but there was nothing behind them. My aunts kept convincing themselves that she was looking at them but she wasn\u2019t. Her liver and kidneys shut down. Her lungs and heart began to fail. It was time to let her go. \n\nMy aunts made the decision to keep her on the vent for two more weeks because they didn\u2019t feel she had been given enough time to heal. The nurse in me knew she wasn\u2019t going to get better. I see this all the time. But the grand daughter in me wanted so badly to believe that I could talk to her again and know she could hear me. The grand daughter in me wanted to see the life in her eyes and hear her voice and hold her hand. The grand daughter in me was also so incredibly angry with my aunts for making a selfish decision. She would not want to live on a machine. Every time she opened her eyes, it was a pain response. If she could have screamed, she would. She was suffering. \n\nOn June 5th, we gathered around her bedside as a family and made the decision to remove the ventilator and let her go. I have never felt pain like that in my life. I didn\u2019t know my body was capable of making the sounds it made. I\u2019d always heard family members grieving in the hospital where I worked but never would have imagined it would be me and my family. \n\nHer funeral was yesterday. It was truly a beautiful service. She was an army nurse so she got her final salute, 21 gun salute with taps and my grandfather was presented with the flag. I just feel so empty.

Situations that feel unwinnable, like every feasible option inevitably leads to defeat. In the moment, it won't feel like fun. You'll question why you even wanted to play. It's part of the game. It's unavoidable. \n\nYou will find that it's easy to panic and kill yourself in these situations. What feels like a second will have passed, you'll look up, and you'll wonder how you could've lost so quickly. You likely lost because chose the easiest and first escape route. You lamented over the fact that you now have to deal with the disadvantage state. You yearned for simpler times when you weren't immediately threatened by defeat while you mindlessly input anything and everything that might help, praying that it would magically fix the issue. We know better. We know that, in these situations, the most obvious option often gets you killed. You have to be patient. Defend. Buy yourself some time, keep a clear head, and assess the situation. Consciously ask yourself what the best course of action is.\u00a0What can you do to stay alive? Choose the best route, and stick to it. \n\nThe reason beginner players panic in these situations is that they view their life total as something they desperately need to protect. They frantically try everything to return to the neutral state, where their health is no longer immediately threatened. They fail to understand that life total is a resource. That there are no extra points for winning with full health. Use it or lose it. You have to understand that in these situations, you will inevitably eat damage; but if you defend properly, you will be alive. You will escape, and return to neutral, alive.\n\nLearning that my brother had died will likely be the worst news I will ever have to hear. But after some time, I understood that it was irreversible. That no amount of questioning and anguish at the universe would bring him home. My options are clear: continue to pine for simpler times, or accept the situation and plan for the best. This is decidedly *not* me saying that I'm already over it. But at the very least I have a plan. I remain patient. I don't jump at the first escape option; I understand that grief takes its time. And I am confident that, eventually, I'll return to neutral, alive. I will have eaten damage, *but I will be alive.*", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I (25m) lost my best friend (25m) to cancer in October 2018. Needless to say its been absolutely horrendous trying to cope with the loss. Prior to this happening I was the kind of person who believed strongly  that everything did happen for a reason, I had been through alot of shit prior to this happening and it always one way or another turned out to either change my life for the better or teach me a valuable life lesson and sent me on a better path. I took great comfort in this way of thinking whenever shit hit the fan. But now that has totally changed. I have completely lost faith in the ideals I had previously held, how on earth was  the death of someone I loved so dearly and needed in my life  \"supposed to happen\". Maybe I could make some sense of it if for example if my grandmother who is 90 had passed away or something like that, but not someone who at 25 had their whole life ahead of them and had so much to give the world. Now I really struggle with that concept and instead have an uneasy sense that nothing happens for a reason and life is just unfair and unjust chaos, which is fucking with my head because as I mentioned, whenever I was going through bad shit in my life previously, one of the things that got me through it was that I believed that it was supposed to happen and that good would eventually come from the pain. I also used to strongly believe in God(not with any affiliation to any particular religion just a general belief) and I did question that belief strongly initially after his death, but Iv come to accept that maybe God does indeed exist but plays no role in what happens here on earth. Sorry for the long post I'm just curious if others have had similar experiences and how have their beliefs etc been affected.\nThank you x", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

She's in hospital stable but not awake so we don't really know the full story yet. This sort of ended up being a huge thing in my town, so people are gossiping a lot. It was even on the news on TV, not just in the papers. It hasn't been released yet to the media that it was a suicide as they still need to do an autopsy and talk to my aunt before they can, but I'm so worried about that getting out because it will likely become a major talking point on legalising euthanasia because they likely did it due to their deteriorating health.\n\nIt's already hard to cope with the fact that not only is my uncle gone, but him and my aunt wanted to take their own lives. It is a very crushing pain to lose someone you love to suicide, and also have to be there to support someone who survived a suicide attempt (which obviously I don't mind doing, but it's going to be very hard on my mental health). What makes it so much harder is having to listen to people talk. I went to the shop today and heard some people talking about it. I put on my headphones and tried to ignore it, but one of the ladies knew I was related to them (I didn't know her, I assume she has my parents on Facebook and seen photos of me because she didn't know my name and just called me \"[generic mom name]'s daughter.\") so she came up to me and tried to get me to tell her more about it as the news has purposely been quite vague about it all. The only reason people know who the victims are is because they were well liked in our town, so news spread fast around their neighbours and then everyone else. \n\nI really just cannot cope with hearing people gossip about it. The way they talk about it makes me sick. People gossip about it as if it was on the same level as a couple breaking up in the workplace. I overheard some people say really horrible things too. \"If they were really a good Christian couple they wouldn't have tried to take their lives.\" was probably the worst, especially because it really hit me that most people already know it was a suicide even though the news hasn't said so. So far only one person has come up to me and asked about it, but I really can't cope with that happening. I've told everyone I'm friends with that I'm not ready to talk about it and to not ask specific details about it as I will tell people when I'm comfortable and if they really wanted to know they could just follow the story in the news. My friends respect this, but unfortunately random people who vaguely know me don't, and probably will ask. I feel like I can't leave the house without hearing people gossip or risking someone trying to speak to me about it. \n\nI really hope it doesn't become a talking point in legalising euthanasia debates. Normally I do quite enjoy that sort of stuff, but I feel like if this became a talking point on that issue in my country, I'd never be able to heal from my uncles death, because I'd be hearing people talk all the time.. It's already hard to process stuff at the minute with everyone talking, and I'd imagine it would just get worse if thst happened. I recognise the chances of that even happening is slim to none, but even the slight potential has had me worried sick. \n\nI just want to be able to grieve in peace and process it all. I feel like I can't. I can't go about my normal life without hearing about it either on news, social media, or from other people. It makes me just want to isolate myself and stay indoors and not even look at social media until I know it's all calmed down.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Today I actually learned what happened to him. He was a drug dealer who sold a lot of weed. In early 2018, he told me he got a job at this company out of state, and that he could go up there for like 5 days or something, do what he described as warehouse work, and return with a good amount of 'clean' money. Apparently this was a lie, and the \"company\" he went to work for was actually a front for an organized heroin ring. I know that is probably hard to believe, but that is what his mother told me today after having a big meeting with the chief of police today. I don't know why they needed him to be up there physically, but while he was up there, he stole $20,000 in cash from the people involved in the heroin ring. \n\nThis answers a lot of questions and seems to make sense. I'm just having a hard time understanding why the fuck he thought he could do that and get away with it. He made a ton of bad decisions that resulted in his death. It's hard to deal with that. Hard to sit here and tell you how much this kid didn't deserve what happened to him. I've never been mad at him. I just love him and miss him so much. The last few months have been the hardest of my life. I had to get up and leave the dinner table because I was crying and my family just pretended it wasn't happening. No attempt at comfort. might as well be in a room of strangers. I can't believe we weren't talking, for what reason I can't even remember, when you got killed. I'm sorry I never told you that I love you. \n\nEvery time I see a shitty blue Honda Civic, there is a brief moment in time where I have forgotten you died, and I feel a bolt of your playful energy in my stomach.

I immediately knew something was wrong... he was crying and stammering over his words. It seemed like forever before he told me my sister, Allyson, had been shot... that Thomas had shot her. Thomas was her abusive ex that she finally left after 6 years of being trapped. \n\nAt this point I didn\u2019t know anymore details. I didn\u2019t know if she was really dead... just that my dad thought she had been shot and she wasn\u2019t answering him. He had called the police and was waiting for them to arrive, had been told not to go back inside in case Thomas was holding her hostage or ready to shoot others... but my dad was sure he had shot her and himself because neither had answered him. \n\nHe asked me to call my siblings for him because he couldn\u2019t do it. I called, no one answered until the third sibling. They were the closest and immediately left Massachusetts and headed to Maine. I was so grateful they could get to my Dad and Mom because I was so far away (in SC). \n\nFinally all my siblings knew what the current situation was and we were all waiting. It took the cops until 5:30pm to actually enter the house... up until then we had hope AND fears. Maybe Allyson had been shot and was still alive. Maybe there really was a \u201cstandoff\u201d as the media and cops had claimed was going on. But maybe she was shot and slowly dying... why were the cops taking so long?! Just get the hell in there! If I were there I\u2019d sneak the hell in. Desperate thoughts were in all of us... \n\nIt. Was. Torture. \nBut in the end. She was murdered. \nNo more hope. \nNo more Allyson. \n\nThomas was a coward and stole a daughter, sister and mother away from all of us. Then he took his own life in the same room.  \n\nThe week following that was not a blur at all. I remember all the tragic moments... it was a rollercoaster of emotions going from confusion, anger, sadness, numbness, anxiety etc. \n\nI flew up as soon as I could get a flight. I just wanted to get there quickly but both flights had maintenance issues... when I finally arrived my sister and BIL had to pick me up from a distant airport and drive the rest of the way.\n\nGetting to the house was surreal. I couldn\u2019t help but walk up the stairs and into the room where it happened. I won\u2019t say what I saw but my reasons for going in there was a mixture of things. I wanted to feel as close to what my sister had to go through as possible. I wasn\u2019t there for her when she needed me. She was all alone with him when she died. I wanted to feel if I still felt her presence. I wanted to try to find some explanation that I already knew I wouldn\u2019t find. I\u2019ll never forget what I saw but I didn\u2019t go far in the room... I felt nothing but emptiness. She was gone. \n\nI still feel so empty and am still on the rollercoaster of emotions. It\u2019s just a lot slower transitions at this point... and mostly just sadness or numbness. I see her daughter everyday since I now have custody. I feel guilty that I get to see this beautiful little soul growing and that Allyson can\u2019t. I feel guilty for being in Allyson\u2019s \u201cplace\u201d as a mother to her daughter. I feel terrible heartache anytime she asks or talks about her mom. She knows what happened but I\u2019m not sure if she knows how or who did it. While this is a whole other portion of the events we didn\u2019t gain custody until 6 days after her mother\u2019s murder. We weren\u2019t the ones that told her. \n\nSo many evil truths surfaced after Allyson\u2019s death that none of us knew about. It\u2019d be too much to continue writing about as this is already getting long but Allyson and her daughter were trapped. They were abused on all levels and had 18 days of freedom before it ended. \n\nHe knew he wasn\u2019t going to get her back and if he couldn\u2019t have her no one could. So he seized his opportunity to take her when he saw it. \n\nWe are all trying to find our way back from this but there\u2019s never going to be a way back. We\u2019ll never have her back which is what we all really want. We couldn\u2019t even see her one last time because this asshole messed her up so bad.

I got a job doing personal training and was making decent money, and loving the job. Things were great, life was good.\n\nUntil July 29th, 2017. A few days before this my dad and I had been texting. He said he believed he had the flu, as he was feeling under the weather. I did not think much of it, until the morning of the 29th. You see, for years my dad and I always had this joke thing, where if he didn't answer my text, I would copy and paste the text and send it over and over. Childish, I know, but it was \"our thing\" and it always got him to reply. Well, this time, it didn't. And that worried me.\n\nI was texting him over and over throughout the whole day and no reply. My boyfriend, who KNEW damn well about how my dad would always answer a text blast, was worried too but tried to keep me calm and think of why he may not be replying.\n\nAt 5:55pm I got a call from a man who identified himself as a NYPD. Asked what my relation to \\[dad's name\\] was. He then said \"I am so sorry, he passed away. \\[Girlfriends name\\] found him\". Apparently, his girlfriend was very worried too as he didn't reply to her texts/calls, so she went over and let herself in with the key she had and found him.\n\nAll I remember is screaming \"what the fuck!!\" over and over into the phone. That's really all I remember, the rest is a blur. I frantically was trying to get in touch with my mom and stepdad, but they were out to eat and had their phone in the car. I couldn't get a hold of my grandma either. Finally, two hours later, my mom called me back in hysterics, broken hearted for me as she just lost her dad (my grandpa) two years before and knew exactly how I felt. She immediately booked my bf and I flights to my hometown. \n\nI did not get the autopsy report for months, but when I finally did, I learned he had bacterial meningitis that spread to his heart causing endocarditis as well. A weakened immune system likely is what allowed him to contract it in the first place.\n\nNot only do I miss him so much, the anxiety that has resulted is no fucking joke. Now, whenever my boyfriend or mom goes a few hours without answering my texts (even if I KNOW there is a logical reason, like they are working) my mind goes to worst case scenario.

She left town on Wednesday to get settled in at her AirBnb for the surgery but I never imagined that when I hugged her that morning that would be the last time I would talk with her.\n\nI was extremely close to my mother, probably closer than most other people are.  She was always by side and I was always by her's.  My father was never close to her and would do his own thing most of the time so I naturally fell in a husband-like position with her, always going to her doctor's appointments and basically doing everything with her.  On my days off from work I would almost always hang out with her and do things with her.  I'm 32 and still live at home with her and my dad so there was almost never a day, unless I went out of town for something, that I didn't see her.  She was basically my other half.  I feel like part of my soul has been ripped out and I keep getting the thoughts that I will never feel happiness again.  I sacrificed so much of my life to make her happy, her life and happiness took precedence over everything else for me.  I just couldn't bare to see her unhappy or anything so I did everything I could to make her happy.  \n\nShe had multiple sclerosis and spinal stenosis and a lot of mental pain from an abusive childhood and mental abuse from my father, so it was my goal in life to make her as happy and comfortable as I could try to.  There was absolutely no warning for any of us and the eye surgery wasn't even super serious.  I was planning on visiting her multiple times while she was up there.  I just feel like this is some sick nightmare that I can't wake up from.  We were all blindsided and I just feel so lost without her.  I've talked with multiple people so far but it's especially hard for me because I don't have a lot of family or friends to turn to, because my mom was always the person I would turn to to talk about everything.  I'm making it a point to use this to get closer to my sister and dad but it's still just so hard for me because every little thing that I see that reminds me of her or of memories of us together just tears me apart.  She was my only true friend who was always there for me irregardless and now she's gone and I just feel so lost without her.  \n\nThis has by far been the worst thing that has ever happened to me and it's going to hard to recover from, if I ever do.  I just needed to reach out to other's who may have experienced something similar and to maybe get some different ideas on what I can do to ease this pain, if that's even possible.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

So I {22F} had a friend {19F} for years. We\u2019ve known each other since birth because my dad and her mom are best friends from high school. Growing up we fought off and on kind of like kids stuff but I always knew something was off about her. She was very delusional. An example would be a couple of years ago I stayed with her so she could do my hair for prom. Her boyfriend at the time lived with her and they didn\u2019t have a guest room so I slept in between them (it\u2019s just how we were chilling but it was still awkward lmao) she was in love with this guy so before bed we were all talking and I\u2019m asking him about himself to get to know him (I had just met him that weekend) and she silently gets up and walks out. We both look at each other confused. (Keep in mind the lights in her room are off) I get up to check on her and she\u2019s in the other room pissed but swears it\u2019s not at me. She was convinced he was flirting with me. I go back in the room and sit on the corner of the bed and he\u2019s sitting where the pillows are and I just say she\u2019s feeling a little jealous and I suggest he go talk to her and before he can even get up she comes in and flips the light on and her makeup is running like she\u2019s been crying and she says she can\u2019t believe what\u2019s going on. So she accuses us of hooking up when that wasn\u2019t the case at all. So these were the kind of fights we\u2019d get into. She very much liked attention. One time her bf and her were fighting and she told him she was going to kill herself and took some pills and immediately told her mom and went to the hospital and was okay. Having dealt with suicide attempts myself in private for real this angered me. It\u2019s what essentially made us drift apart. But we\u2019d still talk here and there. So a few years go by and she has a new boyfriend and seems so incredibly happy. Until she wasn\u2019t I guess. They got into it one day. He left her house and she was screaming at him on the phone so he hung up on her and she went out to her field and shot herself. That was in December. I\u2019ve had such a hard time with this because on top of normal feelings like guilt and sadness I\u2019m also confused and not sure what to think. Part of me wants to think it was an impulse decision and maybe if she had lived she would\u2019ve regretted doing that. It\u2019s clear she\u2019s always been mentally ill I just didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever do that. You always hear that people who say they\u2019re going to do it never really will. And she used to say it all the time. This time she didn\u2019t. Why was this time so different? Was this the ultimate act of attention? Should I feel awful for thinking that? I can\u2019t seem to get a clear thought because it\u2019s all so jumbled. I can\u2019t even grieve properly because I\u2019m so confused on everything including how to feel.

Today is my dad\u2019s birthday as well. This time last year he was in the hospital joking with the nurses, making sure they had a slice of his cake. On the 30th he died. I was the last person (family) with him when he was conscious.   He had a rare auto immune disorder, coupled with congestive heart failure. The December before he had been in the hospital for fluid in his chest. He was having trouble breathing, but he pulled through. \n\nHe had myasthenia gravis, which is very rare and it\u2019s symptoms mostly have to do with voluntary muscle weakness. He told us a few years ago, but he probably knew for longer. He was hyper independent and didn\u2019t tell us about anything unless he thought it was important. Like I didn\u2019t know he was in an accident and damaged his spine until two weeks later (a distracted driver hit him from behind). He spent the last decade of his life alone in another state by himself by choice. He said he was a loner and was fine with it. He was retired but kept working. Trying to write a second book and staying active.  ButI knew he wasn\u2019t close to anyone. He never had close friends that I knew. \n\nIn the hospital it first looked like a short stay, but as soon as one thing got under control another thing went wrong. He deteriorated quickly. He had breathing treatments but sometimes he would get short of breath and get confused. I was with him when one of those episodes happened, and he forgot where he was.  Then he practically stopped eating. My mom is a retired nurse, and despite then being divorced she was involved in this process and was there for all of us. My family, especially the women have always been practical, she told me in confidence my brothers don\u2019t do well with this sort of thing) that he was in the process of dying, that his body was shutting down and he wouldn\u2019t last the year. He didn\u2019t last the month. \n\nThat last night, I was dealing with a minor house emergency. My water heater was leaking and while I was managing the situation with towels if I left it fit too long the water would leak to the furnished part. It didn\u2019t occur to me to shut the water to the heater off, there was so much going on and I could only deal emotionally with so much. I had to leave. My brother would come later, the rest of my family was ok with it and knew what was going on. \n\nMy dad barely ate. I fed him like a child and he only had a couple bites. Mostly he slept.  I needed to leave and he asked me not to go. The last thing he said was he was lonely. I told him it would be ok and hugged him and kissed his head, made sure the nurses knew I was going and went home to my other problems. \n\nA couple hours later i got the call, rather I saw a voicemail from my brother a half an hour before. \n\nOn the drive over I felt electric. A song came on the stereo. Carry by Tori Amos, it\u2019s beautiful, it\u2019s a song about remembering ones you\u2019ve lost. It\u2019s one of my favorites. I can\u2019t listen to it now, or rather I haven\u2019t tried. \n\nWhen I got there it was right when he stopped breathing. My younger brother and mom were there. I held his hand as his heart stopped. His blue eyes staring at the ceiling at nothing. \n\nI can\u2019t tell y friends what actually happened. I can\u2019t tell my brothers what he said. I don\u2019t feel guilty for leaving, I didn\u2019t know, but I should of handled my shit better so I could have been there. I came up short. Nobody has said anything and I don\u2019t feel blame or judgement from anyone. I could have done better. \n\nMy dad and I weren\u2019t close. Without writing a novel there was a lot we disagreed on and while I tend to let that slide and focus on what\u2019s important with family, he would become obstinate and angry if I showed any evidence I disagreed. He was very conservative buying into fix news propaganda, and decided the Bible was the literal truth.  I stopped being Christian when I turned 18, and I\u2019ve always skewed liberal. Being around him was uncomfortable, because I\u2019d have to do as he directed. The home I grew up in was very patriarchal and as his daughter I had to follow him in all things. I learned very early I couldn\u2019t challenge him. He had already cut his family from his life, and as I got older I found I had a half sister from a previous marriage he had also cut from his life. I knew I had to keep parts of myself from him in order for us to have any relationship. I had to make sure as he got active on social media he wouldn\u2019t see something that would freak him out. It wasn\u2019t that hard to do, but it meant not sharing a core part of me with family. Oh he knew I was liberal and not Christian, but he couldn\u2019t deal with proof of that. Also on the flip he would often give be business advice, and I learned the hard way that he didn\u2019t know anything about my industry, as successful as he was in his. \n\nBecause of that, his death has also felt like a relief. I don\u2019t have to hide anymore. I feel guilty about this. \n\nHe was always supportive of me in my work, more than anybody else in my family. He wanted to own it , requested art as gifts or would buy something if he thought needed money.  The rest of my family is indifferent and if I die I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll all end up in a landfill. \n\nAnyway. It was not the close relationship I would have liked. I couldn\u2019t be the daughter he wanted. A conservative Christian with a husband and kids and all. My mom has said it shouldn\u2019t feel bad about this. He was always peculiar, and I did the best I could. I can\u2019t help but wish things were different, even though I know wishing for the past to be different is a waste of time. \n\nAnyway.

My mom, dad, and younger brother live out in the country about 28km from the nearest town. \n\nMy dad had an unexpected heart attack on the 18th of May.  He was with my mother in the yard of the country home in the garden when he thought he pulled his shoulder. He was feeling a little nauseous  but hes typically that way anyway.  He took and advil and went for a shower, said he was feeling better and went to lay down because he couldn't get comfortable on the couch.  My mom had apparently googled symptoms of a heart attack and he didn't really have any of them.\n\nWithin 20 minutes my mom heard a strange gurgling sound and found him with his eyes rolled back, and the color purple. We are pretty sure he was already gone by this point. My mom screamed for my younger brother, called 911 and they did CPR for 15 minutes before the ambulance arrived. They restarted his heart with an AED and he had regained consciousness at the hospital. He pulled at the air tube and had to be sedated.\n\nThey flew him to a cardiac ICU, cooled his body down to prevent brain injury and eventually gave him a stent. He had a 90 % blockage and I guess it's in an area that, if you get a blockage there is called the widowmaker.\n\nIt took him  2 to 3 days to open his eyes after the sedation wore off. At times his heart rate would spike ( from 70 to around 92) when we talked or played his favorite music. But he couldn't do anything on command. \n\nHe eventually started having seizures\n So hard that he would bite the breathing tube and broke 8 of his teeth.  The 4 on the top had to be removed after trying to wire them together failed. \n\nThe neurologists showed us the MRI and it was more white than grey. This whole time the entire family visited him every day. All that was left of him was his organs and his brain stem. \n\nWe had to let him go\n We were told with 98 % certainty he wouldn't wake up and if by a miracle he did, he wouldn't have any quality of life. He survived 33.5 hrs on life support and my mother and I never left his side. He passed at the age of 50.\n\nIn the aftermath we realized he didn't have a will, there is endless paper work. Everything from taxes to death benefit to work  life insurance to mortgage life insurance.\n\nThe estate had more debt than assets which we are trying to liquidate but  it requires the lawyers to give a letter for my mom to  be able to sell them. ( two vehicles worth maybe 7500$ in total).\n\nThe family has come together and we are all falling apart one by one since. My grandparents are not doing well, my grandmother was in the ER for broken heart syndrome the day he passed. I rushed my sister last week to the ER because she was having heart palpitations  ( apparently low potassium  was the cause). \n\n My sister, my mom, my aunt, and both my grandparents are on sedatives. I'm on sleeping pills and the strongest one seems to be my younger brother who has a very rare neuromuscular  disorder and was the one to give CPR. Anytime I talk to him he just says hes angry about it all and doesn't  like to think about it. I'm not very close ( 8 year age gap and hes very Introverted) I'm not sure how to help him.\n\nI woke up this morning 6 hours earlier than normal, found out my sister made a Google drive of all.the photos and videos we could find. I got to hear his voice for the first time since Easter. It's a video of him explaining how a machine at work operates. But it's something. \n\nI guess I mostly wrote this to get the story out, but I have no idea how to deal with any of this anymore. Its mostly just been making sure the family keeps it together but I've been in tears for over 2 hours.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

How I lost my better half.", "author": "glitch82", "self_text": "I\u2019m a nerd who immigrated from Egypt at a young age (9), identify as white, had a Napoleon Dynamite thing going for the first 13 years my life, which gave way to a focus and determination on developing certain obviously lacking social skills.  This came at the expense of maintaining academic excellence, so this perfectionist nerd found his straight-As slipping to straight Fs by the end of 11th grade.  Cue a nervous breakdown and a stunt where I ran away from home and stayed with a friend from Houston for 2 weeks. When I got back, my parents were still in shock, so they took me to see psychologists and psychiatrists, and I got diagnosed with ADD and put on adderall.  The medication worked but it was too late: a first quarter of straight As in a repeat of junior year did nothing to curb my humiliation of repeating a year of high school; big changes in personality and self-confidence lead to me dropping out, pursuing a GED and starting community college all in rapid succession.\n\nA halfway decent plan of getting an Associates degree followed by a transfer to a state university got put on a back burner when daily calls for IT consulting with an increasing number of private practitioners around town immediately took priority as I saw an opportunity for entrepreneurship.  However, amphetamine has a funny way of giving a person false confidence.  I was cocky and not very good at managing money, so years of mismanagement, partying and chasing girls lead to the end of a 10 year venture that never grew beyond 5 employees.  \n\nBut before that demise and up until, I got a surge of artificial self-confidence that led to several, positive life-altering epiphanies involving social anxieties, self-esteem, self-worth and sexual prowess. I began developing social skills that I was severely lacking for several agonizing years, so by the time of my venture\u2019s demise, now in my mid-to-late twenties, having seen through to several brief relationships based on sex, or zodiac sign, I was about to begin one of the greatest experiences of my life, but it came at a very steep price, and I had no way of possibly knowing what I was about to get myself into.\n\nHaving always been in tight control of my relationships meant I always dumped the girl first when things got stale. I knew from past experiences of putting myself out there, and just by watching and learning from others, that a relationship was kind of like a constant power struggle.  The moment someone capitulates and exposes any insecurity is the moment their partner realizes they can trade up.  It\u2019s okay to be a nice guy with a big heart, but if you don\u2019t want to finish last, play the asshole card occasionally.  See, people always want what they can\u2019t have... everyone wants a partner that is the best they can possibly pull, so if you\u2019re quick to expose your insecurities before a relationship matures, that inevitably will have your partner feeling like they\u2019ve settled lower than they should have. But if you occasionally play the asshole card, keep them on their toes, lead instead of follow, and be sweet as sugar when it counts, you\u2019ve built a foundation solid enough for the marriage of a lifetime.  So, to be in control, I never dared put pussy on a pedestal. Plenty of fish in the sea, right boys?  \n\nIn the wake of the fall of my entrepreneurial venture, facing certain financial ruin (and family shaming), as I rode the hump of my mid-20s, I began nursing a harmless pill habit. One day, while acquiring more of these amazing little capsules of joy, I meet this gorgeous southern bombshell. After incredible sex, it dawns on me that this girl also has a big heart, is more loyal than some of the best bros I\u2019ve met, and perhaps most astonishingly, this vixen truly had no idea how sexy she was.  This 4-way indescribable clusterfuck of desirable female attributes, (the mother of all jackpots and fuck your powerball) and its implications create a scenario I had previously deemed \u201cfucking impossible.\u201c\n\n\u201cDoes this mean I\u2019m living in a false quantum vacuum, then?\u201d I pondered this as I also mused that a return to a normal quantum state would be noticed by absolutely no one.\n\n\n(((Commercial  Break))))\n\n\nSo, just to recap, this immigrant nerd who took inordinate amounts of time to socially develop, sat waiting for the false quantum vacuum I had no clue our universe existed in to spontaneously return to a normal energy state, blinking everyone out of existence. That was a more plausible reality than the existence of a girl like this Alabama bombshell I met sometime ago.\n\nThese are positive attributes previously thought to have been mutually exclusive in any one female, and yet, here she was.\n\nOh, wait, she\u2019s a drug addict. Fuck. That\u2019s alright, I can save her (and myself) from herself. (And, my...self?) Naturally.\n\nFirst year: friends with benefits. \n\nYear 2: girlfriend status.  Also, I found her dabbling with needles.  Rather than pull a dramatic ultimatum, I risk a brilliant move: I decide to go all-in with her. Not just in order to better understand her predicament, but also to have the leverage I need and be able to give her the encouragement she needs for us to quit the habit together while having a leg to stand on. \n\nYear 3: engagement (and pregnancy). \n\n(Okay, in all seriousness, this was also the year I realized that IV drugs are just as powerful as everyone says they are.  It\u2019s not the same lie it was with pot, or a weekend getaway with an 8 ball of coke; IV hydromorphone is the best thing on the planet, short of a mind bending orgasm, when you have it on hand. When you don\u2019t, it\u2019s the absolute worst).\n\n(((Commercial Break)))\n\nWhen we last left off, I was on the verge of being (almost) a proud father and husband. \n\nAfter 4 insane years at rock bottom while knocking on the door to my 30s, I made 2 bittersweet observations: \n\n1.  I was madly in love with this girl. (But also, she happened to be madly in love with me. Fuck, maybe that ultimatum would have worked after all. I severely underestimated my pull, big time. Also, did anyone notice how much progress I\u2019d made? This was a far cry from the early days where I\u2019d stammer and look away if the pretty girl paid any attention to me. Hard to believe that was me). \n\n2. That was more than one observation. Also, any progress truly helping her kick this opiate habit would take years.  Luckily, I was up to the task.\n\nYear 4: She was admitted to the hospital in a catatonic state  brought on by severe septic shock. After 10 days in an artificially induced coma, followed by 2 months of recovery, she began slowly developing an endocarditis condition that would require antibiotic treatment, and a lung condition, which was left untreated because the pulmonary specialist who examined her felt like it was \u201ca waste of time since she\u2019ll go right back to using again.\u201d Regardless, I felt like that was a shitty excuse for this ray of sunshine not to perform her job, especially because it wasn\u2019t some charity job. So fuck you too lady, at least we aren\u2019t a waste of space.\n\nYear 5: Past legal troubles catch up with my wife. While serving 6 months inside jail, repeated requests for the antibiotics prescribed by her cardiologist are denied by the clinic. She sits helpless as her condition escalates from one treatable with antibiotics to one that will inevitably require valve replacement surgery  \n\nAlso, during the same year, after being released from jail, my girl attends a mandatory court-ordered 6 month rehab program. Occasional overnight visits and ever increasing freedom make this a very tolerable if not positive experience that gives her lots of much needed structure, putting her on the bright path to an opiate free future.\n\nYear 6: Right around the time she was supposed to graduate this program, breathing problems and bouts of feeling light headed prompt her to check with a cardiologist and confirm our worst fears: Bacteria damage around the heart valve was too great; replacement required.\nThen the surgery. For whatever reason, (was it botched?) She was told that what was to be a valve replacement has now in fact been upgraded, at no additional charge, to a valve replacement surgery with a free pacemaker. Okay. Fine.\n\nMy wife cries as she\u2019s injected with IV dilauded for the first time in over a year. Her love of sobriety doesn\u2019t unfortunately mean that sobriety loves her back.\n\nMeanwhile, complaints that she\u2019s unable to breathe properly are downplayed as healing pains and ignored. After 3 agonizing days, an x-ray confirms that she did in fact have a collapsed lung since the procedure which saw the addition of the pacemaker. One more surgery for the road? Third time\u2019s a charm, and all.\n\nA home prescription is necessary after such invasive surgery but it doesn\u2019t help her self-esteem and focus at all. After finishing her prescriptions during recovery, she is back on opiate replacement therapy with suboxone to avoid total relapse. (To her credit, she never once relapsed until the day she died).\n\nYear 7: (Or maybe 8. Fuck, did I miscount?) After improving a lot at first, my wife gradually declines in health. At one of the appointments that I couldn\u2019t attend, she learns something awful that, despite several attempts and almost once blurting it out, she never once shared with me up until the fateful day. I was ridesharing late into the night, and when I came home I found her laying face down on the foyer, with our 5 year old standing over her. \u201cMamma threw up,\u201d was all she said. I\u2019ll never forget when I turned her over, that empty gaze... the CPR I tried to do to her still warm face and body... the paramedics arriving, attaching EKGs only to then call it.\n\nAnd that was just 3 months ago.\nNow I sit here, pondering if the last 8 years of my life meant anything at all. I mean, I obviously have a sweet daughter, and I have a bunch of photos and memories of this experience. I know time heals, and it would be naive to think I\u2019ll never meet someone I wouldn\u2019t want to try being in a relationship with, one day.\nBut I can say with 100% certainty, that I know beyond the shadow of a doubt, no matter how far or wide I\u2019ll search I\u2019ll never find a girl who had a heart as big as she did. I\u2019ll never be with anyone that will love me as much as she did, because even when I had nothing, even when I was nobody... she was right there by my side. And for a girl that attractive to act that way, well... she definitely was one of a kind.\n\nThanks for reading, fellas. Everything 100% true. Photos of her can be found in various posts of mine, and yes, even nude selfies. Be respectful please. She also used to be a redditor, albeit for a brief time.  u/SexyMia88.\n\nRIP, Bae.

{"post_id": "c1imyc", "created_utc": 1560741421, "title": "Looking back on this year that my father passed away on", "author": "genifteth", "self_text": "Happy Father's Day everyone! This post is just to kinda reflect on everything I've been going through this past year basically. It's been rough, seeing your dad be on the brink of death and then recover only to later pass away suddenly, but I think I learned a lot during this too.\n\nExactly a year ago from today, my dad regained consciousness from suffering from total organ failure. The weeks before were really tough. All the doctors and nurses there were telling me it was better to free him from his suffering and let him pass away. But the thing is, I hadn't ever been close to my dad and hadn't seen him in a long, long time until we got the call that he was in the hospital. I'm still relatively young, and at my age, you really think you have all the time in the world to be with people, and that's what I thought with my dad. I thought I'd have my 20's, 30's and more to patch things up with him, but in one night it seemed like I had just lost the chance. I knew I'd live with regret for the rest of my life if I didn't have the chance to talk to him again at least once and tell him that I loved him. So I turned into this distraught person at the ICU, pushing for doctors there to pursue whatever surgery was necessary to keep him alive. Then, the day before he was due for a major surgery that would alter how he would breathe, he woke up miraculously. \n\nHe was okay for a few months after, and he went to at home hospice (since he didn't have medicaid and we couldn't afford anything else at the time) and then he went to a nursing home after he was approved for medicaid.   His health always fluctuated. I tried to visit as much as I could, but I had to go back to school. During this time, in the back of head I was always scared that my dad would pass away suddenly.  Just when I thought he was getting better, my fear came true. After a few months had gone by, he passed away suddenly after we thought he was getting better. I remember getting lunch with my friends, and then my mom called and I had to leave campus that day. My church pastor had been visiting my dad more often, and he told me that my father had always been calling out my name to see me. That broke my heart, and I still am always upset by it. At that time, the last time I had seen my dad was a month ago, and I didn't have the chance to say a proper goodbye to him. I hope I'll forgive myself for this over time, but there hasn't been a day where I haven't thought about this. \n\nThe months after were really rough. I've always had the sense of guilt I mentioned before everyday. I got a lot of  supportive messages from my friends who found out, but I found myself wanting to distance myself from everywhere because I knew that they didn't know how it actually felt to lose someone. I ended up cutting a lot of people out of my life, but in the end I'm glad I did this because I was able to see who I could actually be close to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI read somewhere that people have dreams of their loved ones sometimes. I had one where I was just talking to my dad a few months back, and then he started walking around. In the dream I got surprised because my dad had been bedridden and too weak to even stand, so I ran over to him to ask how he was walking. He just smiled at me, and then I woke up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went to visit his grave today with my mom and it was peaceful despite all the bug bites I got. My mom was sharing how her friend had a dream that my dad was smiling. I don't know if I believe that dreams like these are visits from your loved ones, but I kinda hope they are. Sure, I'm sad that my dad won't be able to see any milestones in my life, like walking me down the aisle if I ever do get married, but I'm still happy I was at least able to talk to him during the months he was alive. This was a long ramble, but I wanted to share this story about my dad on Father's Day. Time really is the best way to heal from grieving.

I have been going through all the stages of grief except acceptance since. \n\nMy father left this world and me on purpose. I feel so hurt, confused, lost, and broken. He had been a terrible person. We fled his house in the middle of the night and I didn't see him again until I was 13. He was a changed man. The very last time I saw him was the first time I told him I loved him since I was 4 or 5. I waited months because I was scared he would snap back to the horrible drunken POS he had been. \n\n My cousin and I were 14 and her mom handed over her car keys to let her take her friends home. She decided to show off and floored the car on a gravel road causing to to flip. Her friends barely had any marks and she went into a coma. A month later they said she was brain dead and they pulled the plug. I had dreams for a very long time that everyone was playing a cruel joke on me and she is still alive. \n\nThen three years ago I lost the man who raised me, my grandfather, due to Alzheimer complications. He was honestly my hero and I watched him slowly become a shell over the course of a few years. I'm so haunted. Everything I didn't do right is haunting me. \n\nThe last time he walked to the bathroom as he was coming out he stopped and I only saw his face for a few seconds. He looked so scared and confused and I was puzzled so I kinda kept looking, then he stepped out and I realized his legs were about to give out. He had no energy to hold himself up. It took me longer to process what I was seeing so I just sat there for a moment. He said \"help me!\" And once my mom turned around and saw was when I finally snapped out of it and took action. We carried him to his bedroom and he had gotten so skinny it was way too easy to lift him. \n\nI couldn't go to the funeral. I couldn't see the best man I've ever known like that. I know my family needed me but I just couldn't. Now I feel so guilty for not going. \n\nAfter my grandfather's funeral I moved out of state hoping the bad dreams (from when I was finally able to sleep) would go away. No, it doesn't work. I eventually get to a point where I try to fall asleep and remember death is a thing and in an instant I'm wide awake and in an existential crisis for days. I've been up 6 days in a row very frequently since then. Meds don't help. Therapy is not effective. \n\nAll three of these people, who I loved so much, ended up getting into an argument or had some sort of issues with before they died. I don't think my dad believed I live him, my cousin thought I was angry with her, and my grandpa and I had a rocky time before he got sick.\n\n\nI don't know what to do. I'm scared to sleep. I'm scared to let people in because they might die too. I pushed what little I had away. I go from being terrified of death to wishing for it when I don't think I can take anymore. Since 2007 it's felt like something has been crushing my chest. I think I'm too weak for the world. I'm constantly reminded of how I'm going to live watching everyone I love die and then I'll eventually die too. I wish someone could wipe my memory so I don't have to remember them and all of this. I know it's horrible to be forgotten but I can't do this.\n\n\nHow can I get to acceptance? It's been so long, I feel like it won't happen and I'll be in this cycle for the rest of my life. It affects me so much that I cannot live a normal life.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Tears can't give me anymore relief. I am just so tired. I will be sad for the rest of my life. The last time I spoke with her was the Friday before it happened. I can't even say the \"D\" word.

Just wanted to share my story and looking for some advice on what is my next step in life.\n\nHmmm. (forgive me if my post seems all over the place) Where to start. Growing up I didnt really do much. My parents always fought. I was a loner at school though I had a couple friends.  I lived basically in the hospital. My mother was diagnosed with Lupus when I was around 5 yrs old. My father was barely around due to work and I assume he just didnt like being around us. At a young age I basically had to take care of my mother on my own. No experience in life what so ever. But all on my mind at the time was to take care of my mother(as a only son should be doing) . Fast forward to my high school graduation I find out that my parents were divorced since i was a freshman. Find out that i had a half blood brother( from my mom) and a sister (from my dad). I was confused/ lost. I didnt know how to react. At the time my mother was getting worse with her Lupus. I felt like i had no choice on how to react. Fast forward again, my mother and i moved to San Jose, California to be with my aunt. A chance at a new life. A new start for us. Or so I thought. You know that saying about family always being there for you? I thought my family would be there ,however months down the road my family starts taking advantage of my mother. Moving here I got my mother on disability and my family saw that. They started asking us for money and would call  me disrespectful when i would deny them any money. Keep in mind I am willing to help anyone that goes out of their way to ask. However all i will ask is \"what do you need help for\". My family never gave me an answer therefore I never helped them. Years later I finish community college and got accepted into San Francisco State University. Proud moment for me I would say. Im not bragging but I manage to get through school on my own and now I am going to a University. My mom's dream is for me to finish college. She doesnt care if I have a stable job or if i become a millionaire.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was determined to finish college and work in Hospice( my dream job). However my first semester in SF my mother passed. I felt like I was in a dream(even to this day) racing down the freeway to the nursing home when i got the call that my mother passed. It all seemed unreal. I get a call at midnight November 12,2017. I pick up and a kid is asking for me saying that my mother passed. I thought this was a joke. Why now? All i remember is walking into my mother's room yelling at my uncle( who was never there for my mom and I) telling him to get the eff out and I never want to see him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hardest thing i have ever had to do was to cover my mothers body when they were taking her away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPrior to my mother passing she was in a nursing home. Visiting her everyday feeding her and just hanging out was my routine after class. I didnt mind it as long as i got to hang out with my mom. Life was looking up. I felt like i had a goal on what i really wanted to do for my future.\n\nNow that my mother is no longer here I feel lost. I took a break from school and am working full time at a tech company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy perspective on life has changed a lot since then.  I use to want a house, a family, friends. Now I just want to live my life without bothering anyone. Just living under the shadows of everyone getting through life without  causing stress on anyone else. I dont want a house, just a nice place to live/sleep/eat etc. I don't want kids(my thoughts now) because i cant even take care of myself. Why would i want to bring another life into the world and have history repeat itself.\n\nBottom line. I need some help. What do you guys feel about having lost someone? What do you guys do to get through the day? How long has it been and how do you feel now?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-John\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have more to say but ill just leave it the way it is.

In a way, I feel like I walk around with 2 losses from her. she was person who taught me to halt anger and become compassionate to seriously difficult situations. \nI just attended her wake service today and talked to her bereaved sister. They had the same voice and my heart skipped a beat. I hadn't heard her voice in a couple years. \nSorry for the long post. it has been very heartbreaking lately.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Her note said to just think \"well, if this is what she wanted, so be it.\" How could she think I could possibly do that?? She texted me right before she did it too something personal that was something I would say to her when I was little. I text her back 2 min later but the message was never seen I looked on her phone. I said \"I miss you I want to come see you more.\" I cant figure out if I would feel better or worse had she seen it. Her car is in my driveway. The one she did it in. I keep looking at it. She took great care to not make a mess so I guess she didnt want us to scrap it. I go between being completely numb in get shit done mode to just melting into the floor crying in agony. I dont know how to just go back to daily routine. I have kids and my husband had to go back to work today. They watched too much tv. I have struggled with suicidal thoughts in the past. I'm having a really hard time with this. So many people have asked what they can do to help. But no one I'm very close to so I cant say \"hey can you come sit here while I cry and be a mess and talk to much about all my regrets and feelings.\" People gave me a lot of food but I've lost weight. I can't eat it. I just quit drinking 2 days before it happened. Welp not any more. I have never really had my shit all the way together but I'm a fucking mess now. I dont have anyone to talk to, I mean I do, but I dont. I need help. I need to ask for help. I feel like people lose grandparents it shouldn't be a big deal or a surprise. Nearly everyone does. I have before. But not one this close and not in this manner. It is different. It's worse. She was my best friend. She was who I'd talk to about this. I want to call her.

I hope this is the place for this. \n\nI was married for 15 years to a seemingly decent man. We had 6 kids and lived a happy family life. He was a good dad and a great friend to me. At the end of our marriage he started being unfaithful. We tried to work on it, went to counseling, did everything we could. He just couldn't stop so we divorced. We reamained friendly and co-parented our kids well. Everyone said we were a great model for divorce. \n\nThree weeks ago I got a call from a detective. They asked me to come get my kids from their dad's house as they had a search warrant. When I arrived there were cops everywhere. I got my kids out of there and we waited to find out what was going on. \n\nMy ex is going to prison for a very long time for having a sexual relationship with an underage girl. When I picked up my kids that day it was the last time they would see their father in their childhood. This was a blow to all of us, to say the least. It's not something we could ever imagine happening.\n\nFor two weeks I've been strong for my kids and have been helping them through their grief. It's been intense. Each day brings something new and heartbreaking from them. I spent so much time comforting that I couldn't even think about myself. I was numb and felt nothing. \n\nThis week I'm falling apart. I feel so alone. Friends have reached out but I can't reach back. I'm angry and terribly sad. I feel like I'm going crazy. I feel no hope, no light at the end of the tunnel. I can't eat or sleep. Being awake feels like torture. I don't understand what's going on with me. Life just goes on for everyone else but I feel like I'm just stuck. I keep telling myself that tomorrow will be easier, but it's not.   \n\nThe rational side says time will heal. But for now everything seems out of control and I have a hard time believing it will get better. \n\nThis is grief. I know it is. I hate that I'm grieving this man that did such a terrible thing. He was my best friend for so many years. I never imagined he could do something so bad and hurt so many people. My heart is broken for my kids.

Died 2 years later.", "author": "glitch82", "self_text": "[Wifey](https://i.imgur.com/TWC2cPh.jpg)\n\n\n\nWarning! Long post; but an interesting read, IMHO. Buckle up. \n\n\n\nI\u2019m a nerd who immigrated from Egypt at a young age (9), identify as white, had a Napoleon Dynamite thing going for the first 13 years my life, which gave way to a focus and determination on developing certain obviously lacking social skills.  This came at the expense of maintaining academic excellence, so this perfectionist nerd found his straight-As slipping to straight Fs by the end of 11th grade.  Cue a nervous breakdown and a stunt where I ran away from home and stayed with a friend from Houston for 2 weeks. When I got back, my parents were still in shock, so they took me to see psychologists and psychiatrists, and I got diagnosed with ADD and put on adderall.  The medication worked but it was too late: a first quarter of straight As in a repeat of junior year did nothing to curb my humiliation of repeating a year of high school; big changes in personality and self-confidence lead to me dropping out, pursuing a GED and starting community college all in rapid succession.\n\nA halfway decent plan of getting an Associates degree followed by a transfer to a state university got put on a back burner when daily calls for IT consulting with an increasing number of private practitioners around town immediately took priority as I saw an opportunity for entrepreneurship.  However, amphetamine has a funny way of giving a person false confidence.  I was cocky and not very good at managing money, so years of mismanagement, partying and chasing girls lead to the end of a 10 year venture that never grew beyond 5 employees.  \n\nBut before that demise and up until, I got a surge of artificial self-confidence that led to several, positive life-altering epiphanies involving social anxieties, self-esteem, self-worth and sexual prowess. I began developing social skills that I was severely lacking for several agonizing years, so by the time of my venture\u2019s demise, now in my mid-to-late twenties, having seen through to several brief relationships based on sex, or zodiac sign, I was about to begin one of the greatest experiences of my life, but it came at a very steep price, and I had no way of possibly knowing what I was about to get myself into.\n\nHaving always been in tight control of my relationships meant I always dumped the girl first when things got stale. I knew from past experiences of putting myself out there, and just by watching and learning from others, that a relationship was kind of like a constant power struggle.  The moment someone capitulates and exposes any insecurity is the moment their partner realizes they can trade up.  It\u2019s okay to be a nice guy with a big heart, but if you don\u2019t want to finish last, play the asshole card occasionally.  See, people always want what they can\u2019t have... everyone wants a partner that is the best they can possibly pull, so if you\u2019re quick to expose your insecurities before a relationship matures, that inevitably will have your partner feeling like they\u2019ve settled lower than they should have. But if you occasionally play the asshole card, keep them on their toes, lead instead of follow, and be sweet as sugar when it counts, you\u2019ve built a foundation solid enough for the marriage of a lifetime.  So, to be in control, I never dared put pussy on a pedestal. Plenty of fish in the sea, right boys?  \n\nIn the wake of the fall of my entrepreneurial venture, facing certain financial ruin (and family shaming), as I rode the hump of my mid-20s, I began nursing a harmless pill habit. One day, while acquiring more of these amazing little capsules of joy, I meet this gorgeous southern bombshell. After incredible sex, it dawns on me that this girl also has a big heart, is more loyal than some of the best bros I\u2019ve met, and perhaps most astonishingly, this vixen truly had no idea how sexy she was.  This 4-way indescribable clusterfuck of desirable female attributes, (the mother of all jackpots and fuck your powerball) and its implications create a scenario I had previously deemed \u201cfucking impossible. \u201c\n\n\u201cDoes this mean I\u2019m living in a false quantum vacuum, then?\u201d I pondered this as I also mused that a return to a normal quantum state would be noticed by absolutely no one.\n\n\n(((Commercial  Break))))\n\n\nSo, just to recap, this immigrant nerd who took inordinate amounts of time to socially develop, sat waiting for the false quantum vacuum I had no clue our universe existed in to spontaneously return to a normal energy state, blinking everyone out of existence. That was a more plausible reality than the existence of a girl like this Alabama bombshell I met sometime ago.\n\nThese are positive attributes previously thought to have been mutually exclusive in any one female, and yet, here she was.\n\nOh, wait, she\u2019s a drug addict. Fuck. That\u2019s alright, I can save her (and myself) from herself. (And, my...self?) Naturally.\n\nFirst year: friends with benefits. \n\n[continued below in a comment reply]\n\nYear 2: girlfriend status.  Also, I found her dabbling with needles.  Rather than pull a dramatic ultimatum, I risk a brilliant move: I decide to go all-in with her. Not just in order to better understand her predicament, but also to have the leverage I need and be able to give her the encouragement she needs for us to quit the habit together while having a leg to stand on. \n\nYear 3: engagement (and pregnancy). \n\n(Okay, in all seriousness, this was also the year I realized that IV drugs are just as powerful as everyone says they are.  It\u2019s not the same lie it was with pot, or a weekend getaway with an 8 ball of coke; IV hydromorphone is the best thing on the planet, short of a mind bending orgasm, when you have it on hand. When you don\u2019t, it\u2019s the absolute worst).\n\n(((Commercial Break)))\n\nWhen we last left off, I was on the verge of being (almost) a proud father and husband. \n\nAfter 4 insane years at rock bottom while knocking on the door to my 30s, I made 2 bittersweet observations: \n\n1.  I was madly in love with this girl. (But also, she happened to be madly in love with me. Fuck, maybe that ultimatum would have worked after all. I severely underestimated my pull, big time. Also, did anyone notice how much progress I\u2019d made? This was a far cry from the early days where I\u2019d stammer and look away if the pretty girl paid any attention to me. Hard to believe that was me). \n\n2. That was more than one observation. Also, any progress truly helping her kick this opiate habit would take years.  Luckily, I was up to the task.\n\nYear 4: She was admitted to the hospital in a catatonic state  brought on by severe septic shock. After 10 days in an artificially induced coma, followed by 2 months of recovery, she began slowly developing an endocarditis condition that would require antibiotic treatment, and a lung condition, which was left untreated because the pulmonary specialist who examined her felt like it was \u201ca waste of time since she\u2019ll go right back to using again.\u201d Regardless, I felt like that was a shitty excuse for this ray of sunshine not to perform her job, especially because it wasn\u2019t some charity job. So fuck you too lady, at least we aren\u2019t a waste of space.\n\nYear 5: Past legal troubles catch up with my wife. While serving 6 months inside jail, repeated requests for the antibiotics prescribed by her cardiologist are denied by the clinic. She sits helpless as her condition escalates from one treatable with antibiotics to one that will inevitably require valve replacement surgery  \n\nAlso, during the same year, after being released from jail, my girl attends a mandatory court-ordered 6 month rehab program. Occasional overnight visits and ever increasing freedom make this a very tolerable if not positive experience that gives her lots of much needed structure, putting her on the bright path to an opiate free future.\n\nYear 6: Right around the time she was supposed to graduate this program, breathing problems and bouts of feeling light headed prompt her to check with a cardiologist and confirm our worst fears: Bacteria damage around the heart valve was too great; replacement required.\nThen the surgery. For whatever reason, (was it botched?) She was told that what was to be a valve replacement has now in fact been upgraded, at no additional charge, to a valve replacement surgery with a free pacemaker. Okay. Fine.\n\nMy wife cries as she\u2019s injected with IV dilauded for the first time in over a year. Her love of sobriety doesn\u2019t unfortunately mean that sobriety loves her back.\n\nMeanwhile, complaints that she\u2019s unable to breathe properly are downplayed as healing pains and ignored. After 3 agonizing days, an x-ray confirms that she did in fact have a collapsed lung since the procedure which saw the addition of the pacemaker. One more surgery for the road? Third time\u2019s a charm, and all.\n\nA home prescription is necessary after such invasive surgery but it doesn\u2019t help her self-esteem and focus at all. After finishing her prescriptions during recovery, she is back on opiate replacement therapy with suboxone to avoid total relapse. (To her credit, she never once relapsed until the day she died).\n\nYear 7: (Or maybe 8. Fuck, did I miscount?) After improving a lot at first, my wife gradually declines in health. At one of the appointments that I couldn\u2019t attend, she learns something awful that, despite several attempts and almost once blurting it out, she never once shared with me up until the fateful day. I was ridesharing late into the night, and when I came home I found her laying face down on the foyer, with our 5 year old standing over her. \u201cMamma threw up,\u201d was all she said. I\u2019ll never forget when I turned her over, that empty gaze... the CPR I tried to do to her still warm face and body... the paramedics arriving, attaching EKGs only to then call it.\n\nAnd that was just 3 months ago.\nNow I sit here, pondering if the last 8 years of my life meant anything at all. I mean, I obviously have a sweet daughter, and I have a bunch of photos and memories of this experience. I know time heals, and it would be naive to think I\u2019ll never meet someone I wouldn\u2019t want to try being in a relationship with, one day.\n\nBut I can say with 100% certainty, that I know beyond the shadow of a doubt, no matter how far or wide I\u2019ll search I\u2019ll never find a girl who had a heart as big as she did. I\u2019ll never be with anyone that will love me as much as she did, because even when I had nothing, even when I was nobody... she was right there by my side. And for a girl that attractive to act that way, well... she definitely was one of a kind.\n\nThanks for reading, fellas. Everything 100% true. Photos of her can be found in various posts of mine, and yes, even nude selfies. Be respectful please. She also used to be a redditor, albeit for a brief time.  u/SexyMia88.\n\nRIP, Bae.

His father found him in his bed, cold and lifeless. He was alone when he died. His/our dog watched him die and knowing him (he\u2019s a smart German Shepherd) he probably tried to help but couldn\u2019t. I\u2019m beside myself. I should have been there. How the fuck do I get through this. Someone please give me answers. \n\nI feel like he\u2019s watching me now.

I'm really struggling right now. My grandpa who pretty much has been my father since I was born is going to die in the next few days. I'm already getting shit from some of my family members because I don't want to go see him in the hospital or be there when they turn the machines off. All my mom has been saying for days is how horrible he looks and how he doesn't even look like himself. Technically he's not even here anymore. He won't know if I'm there or not. He's already gone. And right now my last memory of him is him teasing me, making me laugh and us saying I love you to each other. I want that to be my last memory of him. Not seeing him die in a hospital where he's unrecognizable and not even really there anyway. I know my grandma is struggling and would like me there but it's hard. I love my mom and I love my grandma. But I love my grandpa the most. I was closer to him than anyone else in my family, every one else on this planet really. I could somewhat show emotions in front of him but even when I didn't, he always knew when I was upset or sad. He got me in a way no one else ever did. He was in Vietnam and struggled with severe PTSD. His way of coping was by cracking jokes and being silly. He always knew when I was upset and he knew I hated people noticing and asking me what was wrong or trying to comfort me. He never did that. He always just teased me and made jokes and tried to get me to smile and laugh which he always managed to do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis sounds awful but if it were my grandma who was in his place, I'd go to the hospital to support him losing her. But I just can't do it for my grandma. I love her but it's not the same. I can't handle people breaking down in front of me. I can't let myself do that and I can't stand being around people doing it either. And my grandma is just beside herself. Today my mom came home and told me that when my grandma heard the news about my grandpa being basically gone she just collapsed in her arms and started sobbing and saying she wanted to die too and she can't live without him and my mom had to physically carry her out of the hospital today. I'm sorry but I cannot handle seeing my grandma like that. I'm not heartless. I just process emotions differently. I struggle with severe anxiety, depression and PTSD. The PTSD especially was one of the many things my grandpa and I bonded over. He knew why I was the way I was and he got it and just understood me in a way no one else in my family does. They would all try to gang up on me on certain things like how I don't like to be touched. My grandma has always forced me to hug her and would critisize me along with my mom when I hesitated and showed I clearly was uncomfortable with it. My grandpa on the other hand would defend me, tell them to leave me alone and because of that I was able to hug him and be affectionate with him in a way I'm not with anyone else in my family. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brother talked to my mom on the phone earlier and he came and told me when she told him that my grandpa was essentially gone and was going to be physically gone in the next few days. Because I didn't say anything or show any emotion my brother left me alone and I'm sure judged me harshly. I did feel it and I did let a few tears fall but I immediately brushed them away and stayed stone faced and emotionless even when my mom came home and told me everything that happened and was starting to cry a little in front of me. I would like to think I helped her by not being emotional. She was dealing with my grandma all day and her breaking down and my mom started crying again when she was telling me everything that happened today. Because I didn't cry or show emotions my mom got herself in check quickly, was able to calm down and stop crying. I personally think this was a good thing and that I helped her. I don't think my mom gets it or me at all. I think like most of my family she thinks I'm an emotionless bitch. But at least she knows not to touch me. My grandma does not get this at all. She's accepted I won't go to the hospital. She doesn't like it but she accepts it. But she does expect me to be at the funeral and I'll go. But there was already an issue that came up concerning that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause of wanting to save money, my grandma has decided to hold the funeral at a church I was forced to go to as a child and teenager. I left that place a long time ago and swore I would never go back and would never see those horrible people again. It's a long story why I hate them but all I will say is they pushed me into self injury and a suicide attempt when I was 17. I will go back there for the funeral because it's my grandpa, but I don't like it and I'm worried about what I might say or do. Those people are so fake and they will try to come up to me and hug me and pretend to care about me even after what they did to me years ago. I don't know if I can handle it. Between dealing with that and also my grandma touching me and breaking down sobbing while she's forcing me into a hug, the thought of it all has me on the verge of a panic attack. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hardest part about all of this is my grandpa is the one person who would have understood my thoughts and emotions about it all and would have helped me cope. I'm sorry this is all jumbled words and emotions. I'm not good at expressing myself and I'm probably coming across as a huge bitch. I'm not a heartless bitch. I just have issues and I like to cry and breakdown in private. Seeing people breakdown in front of me or people touching me while I'm upset just makes it worse for me. I like to be alone in my grief.

She outlasted at least 6 roommates in the palliative care unit...she fought that hard.\n\nAlthough she re-gained speech, she was confined to a hospital bed and couldn\u2019t eat much. Still, we did everything we could to make her comfortable and show her our love. My mom, my papa, and my great aunt went up every day. We got her TV for her room so her days wouldn\u2019t be so dull.

Or why I\u2019m writing this. I just need to get this out.\n\nMy uncle was my very best friend. He wasn\u2019t even my real uncle, but he loved me more than any of my real family members. My mom met Clyde when she was sneaking (underage) into gay clubs in Philly in the 1970\u2019s. They had a blast (I REALLY wish I could\u2019ve been there), and ended up becoming really close friends. When my brother and I were born, Clyde loved us from day 1, so he was named my godfather. My family and I moved to the Midwest, but we always kept in touch with Clyde, and as I grew up I formed my own independent friendship with him.\n\nGrowing up as a queer person in the Midwest was tough, but Clyde was like my long-distance gay mentor. He helped foster my self-confidence, listened to me gay cry for hours on the phone, and he even flew me out to Philly one  summer when I was in high school so I could get a taste for city life and know that things could get better. When I graduated high school he came out for my graduation, gifting me with a laptop to take to college with me the next year. That man cared about my future as much as my own parents did. Nobody else showed me that kind of unconditional support.\n\nThroughout my 20s, Clyde and I remained close, but he was slowly getting sicker and sicker. The stubborn ass smoked a pack a day and refused to go to the doctor. After a hospital scare 4 years ago, we all thought he was a goner for sure. He was diagnosed with end-stage COPD, and he was even transferred to hospice care. But, again, Clyde is stubborn so he held on. Left hospice care. He went back home. Can you believe it?\n\nSo this sucker held on for 4 years. I called him every week (sometimes more), and we would literally talk for hours. By the end of the conversation, both of our ears would be hot and sweaty from being on the phone for so damn long. We would joke that it was my community service obligation to entertain this elderly man, but secretly, it was for me. Selfish, I know, but he was my favorite person to talk to (cue the waterworks)...\n\nI could call him at any hour. On any day. No matter what he was doing, he would always make time to talk to me. As soon as I said \u201chello\u201d he would instantly know what kind of mood I was in. I could never lie to him or hide anything. He was the only person who truly knew every gory detail about every horrible thing I\u2019ve ever done, and not once did I ever feel judged. I never held back, and he was always accepting of what I shared with him. He didn\u2019t always agree, but he accepted me.\n\nIt had been a few weeks since I called him. I know I shouldn\u2019t feel too guilty, but I do. So I talked to him briefly on Tuesday, but he told me he was tired so I said I\u2019d call him in a few days. I called him today, but there was no answer.\n\nI already knew.\n\nI left him a message, hoping maybe he was just napping or doing something else. Hours later, still no answer. I lied to the front desk at the building he lives in and told them I was his niece. I asked them to check on him, and they said they would and call me back. They never called me back, but I bugged them every hour or so until they told me.\n\nThey found him unresponsive. They called an ambulance, but it was too late. He was DOA.\n\nSo here I am. Oscillating between sobbing and cold, unfeeling numbness. I want to hear his voice one last time. The way he always said \u201coh, hi!\u201d when he realized it was me on the other end of the line. I want to hear just one more of his rousing speeches about how I\u2019m so amazing and I should really consider running for president. I miss him. I can\u2019t stand how much I miss him already and I\u2019ve only just begun. \n\nSo what do I do now?\n\nEdit: grammar. Also I left him a sappy message on his answering machine. I\u2019m a complete fucking mess.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He seperated from his gf (which was me!) 3 months later saying he didn't want to get married etc. \n\nI was his only proper relationship and he has made no effort to find another gf since we seperated. We have remained the best of friends. \n\nI have chatted about his dad and through knowing him for 5 years I've realised he cant even bring himself to think about him. He has no photos of him and only mentions him if I ask. I actually went to see his siblings and got some photos and we went through them together and he was incredibly emotional. \n\nHe also never speaks of his mum unless I bring her up (she was awesome and he loved her so much)\n\nHe isn't close to his siblings but not due to their lack of trying - he has just chosen to isolate himself. \n\nHe has friends and a good job but in times of stress he completely freezes and shuts down. Most recently he had a job interview he needed to do a lot of prep for and he just couldn't do it. He completely froze and the day before even said he wasn't going. I confronted him and he cried and felt better enough to go. \n\nHe has now accepted he probably has issues regarding his father's death.

My dad passed away a week ago from brain cancer. He was 62, and was diagnosed with one of the most aggressive forms of brain cancer 2 years ago. Up to the past 2 weeks, he was doing really well. We knew his timeline was coming but I guess I just thought the decline of his health would be a lot more gradual. But he was pretty much 100% good one weekend and by the next weekend he was completely bedridden and passed away within 2 weeks. It\u2019s just absolutely crazy and sad to think that his health changed and declined that drastically.\n\nSo, now that he\u2019s passed, it just seems so weird and sad at the same time. Most of the time I feel numb, but then other times I feel guilty for feeling numb. And then I get upset sometimes because it\u2019s so weird and seemingly screwed up that my life just goes on after his death and I don\u2019t know how to process that. I\u2019ve never been super religious so I\u2019ve really been trying to explore myself more spiritually lately because I so desperately want to believe that he\u2019s somewhere where he can see me and he can be with me, and somewhere where he\u2019s truly happy and he\u2019s ok. It\u2019s so hard because it doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s gone sometimes when I\u2019m feeling numb but then there\u2019s other times where it hits \nMe like a bus. And I\u2019ve read all of the different sources that have said that this is normal for grief, that it comes in waves, etc. But I think it would help me to get some perspective on how others have handled this, both emotionally and spiritually. I think one of the biggest things that makes me upset is not knowing for sure that he\u2019s happy, that he really is somewhere where he can always be with me, by my side.

We used to have deep and expansive convos in the evening all the way to early the next morning. Now I can't fall asleep between roughly 11PM and 7AM, unless I'm intoxicated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't even realize how abnormal this was until my therapist responded with genuine shock and concern at hearing my sleep habits. I really want to know whether any of you have developed similar unhealthy habits as a result of losing someone, how you have coped with them (whether \"coped with\" means \"became accustomed to\" or \"managed\"), and really just any insight and/or advice you might have to offer. So, here goes the story of my unhealthy habit borne of grief:\n\nMy bff killed herself in October. We were online friends, as she lived in Canada and I live in the States. But I've never felt even 1/4th as close to anybody, online or f2f (even my ex, who I was madly in love with). We talked whenever possible, so much so that our texts easily made up more than 95% of all texts I received. And the overwhelming bulk of our deep and intimate convos happened in the evening and late night hours, since we were both busy with work and school during the day and would be waiting eagerly until after 6/7PM when we were free to spend time together and \"hang out\". We'd do lots of activities together, but our \"thing\" was creating Spotify playlists for each other and then listening to them together while just talking about what the songs meant to us, what they made us feel, the memories they evoked. On average, I'd say we listened to music together like this 2-3 times a week. But we had serious convos from 6/7PM to 2-4AM around probably 5-6 times a week. And when we did hang out, usually it was while I was lying in bed (when I \"should've\" been sleeping perhaps -- I REGRET NOTHING lol).\n\nFast forward to now. On Saturday, it will have been 7 whole months on the dot since I lost her. And aside from a handful of days (definitely less than 7) since then, I have been entirely unable to fall asleep (without being intoxicated) between roughly 11PM to 7AM. I can usually fall asleep if I'm tired enough and go to bed before or after that period. But between those times, I literally just cannot fall asleep. The moment I lie down with the plan to sleep, I can immediately feel that I'm going to be awake for a while -- even if I'm physically exhausted (and not just worn out, but *sleepy af*). And I just *can't* fall asleep. Sometimes I lie there, eyes closed and lights off, literally for hours. Often I feel anxious when this happens, but sometimes not. And I feel like I've tried everything to fall asleep, but with no success. Here's a list of the things I've tried (off the top of my head, although I may be forgetting some):\n\n* Melatonin\n* Sleeping pills from my psychiatrist\n* Crying until I can't cry anymore\n* Breathing exercises\n* Putting on light background noise such as music, instrumental music, ambient noise (brown noise used to really help me fall asleep), the air conditioner, NPR, the Office for the 11th time, Tibetan singing bowls, etc.\n* Weighted blanket\n* Exercising and/or stretching before (sometimes immediately before, sometimes a few hours before)\n* Not using devices after 7, or not using devices during the day, or not using devices the previous few days\n* Not drinking caffeine after noon, or not drinking caffeine during the day, or not drinking caffeine the previous few days\n* Not drinking booze after 7, or not drinking booze during the day, or not drinking booze the previous several days\n* Meditation exercises before\n* Not sleeping outside of the time between 11PM and 7AM to become sleepier in the hope that I fucking crash a calculated crash fucking landing somewhere in that target area\n\nI started off doing one by one,  then began adding on more of these when one or the other didn't work. I've so many ridiculous combinations of these, and even all at once, and even taking a hiatus from attempts in the hope that it's like trying to start a car with a battery that's almost dead but not quite dead. But all of this to no avail. The only way I've been able to really fall asleep during these hours is by being tipsy or drunk before then. But this has its obvious disadvantages (sleep is still shite, mood is also shite, and the hangovers are shite); I did that for maybe a solid month, and I have no desire to go back to that. Recently, after months and months of trying to find another solution and continually feeling like I was wasting my time lying in bed for no reason, I just stopped trying to fall asleep during those times. I still have to work, though, so when my work week is busy I'll pull 2 to 3 all-nighters a week, and when I don't my sleep schedule is fucked. I've adjusted to it, because I felt like I tried so hard to change it (it hurts like fuck not sleeping!) and failed to yield any results. For better or worse, that's how I've coped.\n\nThis way of coping is really fucking painful. It's messing with my mood and functionality, and I want nothing more than to change it. But I'm thinking I'm gonna have to get creative with my approach. My therapist and I are trying to explore creative ways to try and change my behaviors. But I also want to explore all potential sources of help, and I thought some of you on here might have some insight based on your own experiences. Any of your thoughts are appreciated.\n\nThanks for reading this. I hope your Mondays are going swell enough!", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I\u2019m not close to anyone on my fathers side and all these deaths occurred from my moms side. Last year, my grandfather passed away almost a year ago. I have a lot of regrets. I remember when he was in the hospital I wouldn\u2019t go everytime my mom asked me to come with her and that\u2019s one of my biggest regret. Besides my mother, father, and brother, he was all I had left. I think I was in denial that he got cancer again and this time things weren\u2019t looking too great. He shortly died after, I was upset and cried a lot the first few days after it happened but I feel like this past year I\u2019ve suppressed these emotions so deep down. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think of him everyday and get sad but I try not to let it be an overbearing feeling since I\u2019ve experienced that three times before and one of my friends died tragically a few years ago. I guess you can say I was kind of getting used to grief although every situation is different if that makes sense. When I really think about it, it doesn\u2019t seem fair that I\u2019m so young and had to go through this so many times. Yeah, it\u2019s life but even though I\u2019m 20, I still feel like just a kid and I went through a lot more grief than a lot of people my age I know. Anyways, I remember about two years ago my grandfather asked me to take his photo in an area in our backyard drinking a bottle of his favorite alcohol so he could post on Facebook, lol. I took it and that\u2019s my favorite picture ever of him. Anyways, it\u2019s a rainy morning and I just went outside and for some reason I took a photo of the exact spot I took his picture and kept looking at that and the picture of him and completely lost it. I\u2019ve accepted that he\u2019s passed but I feel like at that moment it really really hit me and I was feeling things I\u2019ve buried so deep inside. Anyways, I looked inside my fridge and we actually had his favorite alcohol, and I sat in the exact spot that I took the photo of him two years ago and I drank a little bit of his favorite alcohol. I was very sad but somehow doing that made me feel a lot better and made me feel some sort of comfort; I literally felt this weight against my back and really felt he was with me even though I know he always is, this was one of the first times I truly felt that. I was very upset earlier and it scared me because I didn\u2019t allow myself for that to happen for the longest time but that whole experience just made me feel at ease and I feel a heaviness in my heart still but I feel a lot better and I just wanted to share, thank you for reading this \u2764\ufe0f", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Is this normal?", "author": "Xxcunt_crusher69xX", "self_text": "I'll preface this by saying I haven't much dealt with death. \n\nLast year my maternal grandpa died. I wasn't very close to him. I did shed a few tears when i first saw his dead body because I'd visited him at the hospital earlier and it was my first time seeing a dead person. Random women (eg neighbors and even house maids) were wailing like he was their husband. There were shrieks. This is part of a local way of mourning the deceased.\n\nI felt like those women had more emotions and tears for my own grandpa than I did, but i chalked it up to not being so close to him.\n\nYesterday my paternal grandma died. I lived with her all my life (it's the custom of my country to have the dad's parents live with you). I never knew my paternal grandpa, my dad didn't either. She was the only one i was close to. She raised me as much as my mom. My mom was extremely abusive growing up, and I remember my grandma being the only one to speak up/protect/console (dad's a coward).\n\nMy grandma was around/over 90, and her health has been deteriorating for months. She accidentally set herself on fire, had a heart attack and last week she lost feeling in her legs. She'd been losing her senses, and the night before her death, we talked about how these are her last days. I feel like death is a mercy at that point (i hope this isn't a trigger for some, it's just my personal belief). \n\nShe'd been independent her whole life, a single mother in Pakistan in the 70s and 80s. She was a person of authority, she was disciplined but kind. It hurt to see her end that way, so that's how I'm justifying it to myself. That her death was a blessing. The thing is, i didn't feel like crying all throughout.\n\nRandom women who've never even met her were wailing like crazy, meanwhile i had to remember her sneaking me food when my mom starved me for weeks, just to raise some emotions to squeeze out a few tears as she was being taken to the grave, and even then, i think just the topic of my abuse is enough to get me crying, not her help or love.\n\nI feel like no person's death could affect me or break me.\n\nThe reason this is a question to ask is, i care a lot for animals!! I don't even step on creepy crawleys, i watch out for animals on the road (even frogs), i look out for passing ants/bugs while walking so I don't step on them. I found a half dead stray puppy on my doorstep, took him to the vet, found out he had parvovirus, got him treatment, but the next day, as i was trying to feed him water, he died in my hands. I cried like a bitch. I mean i lost it. I nearly had a breakdown, i was wailing and sobbing like those random women at funerals. I knew that puppy for less than 24 hours, and i cried more for him than my own damn grandparents combined. What the fuck is wrong with me?!\n\nSorry if these are triggers for any of you, I just wanted to comb out feelings as I'm currently able to get therapy.

I don't know what I expect in response to this, I just wanted to type it out and post it somewhere where some people might understand or by sympathetic. I really don't know. Last week monday, the day after fathers day, I had plans to see a movie with my dad. I called him a few times and he wasn't picking up so eventually my mom and I drove over to his house (he lived close, like a mile away). I had a bad feeling. When we got there his car was in the driveway and his lights were on which worried me more. I knocked and when there was no answer I think I pretty much knew at that point what was happened. I opened the door and saw him on the couch. He looked asleep. I yelled \"dad\" several times before touching his arm, I fell over onto the floor and yelled \"he's cold\" and then my mom starting saying \"just hold on\" over and over and she called 911. I started hyperventilating and went outside. I was pretty numb or in shock or something the rest of the time dealing with paramedics and the cops etc. It's like it still doesn't feel real to me. I keep remembering it. Sometimes I feel numb and sometimes I feel intensely sad and then sometimes I feel really angry. And I'm not religious so dealing with the idea that he just doesn't exist anymore has been hard, especially given most family and stuff try to comfort me with stuff that is at least implicitly religious. I kind of want support from strangers but don't know where to turn because I don't want to go to group grief meetings or something at a church. I don't know. This has been long. Thanks for reading. OH yeah, and the last thing I texted him was \"give me a call back when you can so I know you haven't keeled over or something\" so that's great.

Basically she had a auto-immune desease for dozens of years, she got a vaccination against the flu which lowered  her immune system, got a bruise and ended up in the hospital, died 3 weeks later. Even though I've always known her sick, there was no reason for anyone to think she would die just like that. I have a very small family, her and I were very close but I feel like I received no emotional support from anyone in my family. My dad has always been emotionally awkward and we didn't know how to communicate (I mean we've never talked about it since she died...), my grandfather didn't come to the hospital because it reminded him too much of his dead wife, my uncle and I became strangers when he got a serious girlfriend years ago and my aunt sent me an awful letter after my mom died to tell me I was a horrible person and that she didn't want to have anything to do with me -I think the letter was unfair and untrue on most points but I realize she was in pain and I heard she is still going through a depression and cut contacts with many people since my mom passed away.\n\nEven though my family could not offer any support, I saw my mom's psychologist a few times, started a grief journal, spent hours on the phone every day with my best friend (she lives in another country) and moved with friends and then with a close friend for a while. I cried a lot, punched my pillow or screamed underwater when I was angry. I had my studies to focus on, had a few hypnotherapy sessions and a job that made me happy. However I half ignored my emotions, smoking a lot of weed, drinking/going out a lot, taking sleeping pills to sleep and Ritalin to study... I was feeling so angry and sad at the same time. \n\n1.5 years later I had a ayahuasca ceremony that opened up a lot of joy in me and made me think the grieving process was over... until a few months later, when I went through a situation that woke up a lot of \"bad\" emotions in me. Since then I've been feeling a pain in my chest that wasn't there before. When I meditate on it I can feel that it's sadness and I cry, I let it be. But it's been going on for so long, I feel so fed up with it because at the same time I do feel mentally like the grief process is over. I might be cut off from my emotions? I've been to a couple of energy healers who told me the pain was about her death while I don't necessarily associate anything with that emotional pain. Even more astonishing was when I went back to the Amazon for 3 kambo ceremonies and 4 ayahuasca ceremonies. I went only for that pain to go away, my intentions every time were to heal from the grief. It barely did anything... for that. As in: it set me free from other huge traumas that I had and gave me a lot of answers on other areas of my life. BUT as some point I felt myself fall into a blackhole and started to cry. I didn't see, hear, associate any of it to my mom. However, all the other participants and the shaman knew why I was crying. While I never had talked about her to any of them, they all asked me about my mother the day after.\n\nThat chest in my pain is just... too much to bear. Anyone had the same and found a solution? I thought about going to a psychologist. I do yoga, use CBD oil and essential oils to soothe me, and working a lot help a lot too but it always come back. Any idea is welcome...\n\nTLDR: My mom died 3.5 years ago, I've had emotional pain in my chest for almost 2 years, not sure what to do?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

She got diagnosed in the March of 2013 and died nearly a year after in the May of 2014. \nIn that one year she was suffering, slowly eaten away both physically and mentally by that curse of a disease, and we couldn't do much just silently watch it and care for her til her last breath. \nSeeing her crumble away in so much pain, and suffering left all of us traumatized. \nI wouldn't wish the horrible things and pain she went through to anybody, not even my worst enemy. \n\nI think more and more about her lately. I always did, but nowadays I have memories resurfacing randomly, and it makes me think more and more, and it always brings me to the edge of crying, sometimes in public too. I have a lot of dreams about her, and I like to think that it's really her trying to contact me. \nIt's been five years, and I still can't let her go.\n\nI feel guilty... I always took her for granted. I really loved her, and she was an amazing person, and an incredible mother. \nBefore she got sick I wouldn't think that anything as horrible as that disease could happen to her, and throughout her sickness I always kept the false hope that she would survive it. (Besides knowing well that she had very little time with us. She was a nurse, she knew it too that she would pass away soon, and she tried to prepare us, but I always swept it under the rug, wanting to believe that everything would be turning out fine) \nI always think about how much more I could do for her. I regret all the bad things and tears that I caused her as kid, and I can't tell her anymore how sorry, nor how grateful I am for everything.\nI feel guilty and ashamed that I didn't use every opportunity during the time I known her to be with her and just enjoy every second of her company. \n\nAll the ideas and thoughts, her personality, and everything that made her to be her just vanished and I can't process the thought that how can the individual turn into nothing in just seconds.\nI know the concept of death yet still can not fathom where did she go.\n\nIs it normal after 5 years? I was into therapy, but not directly because of grieving. \nThe burden of realisation hit me months after her death. First it was really weird, yet again I tried to sweep everything under that rug, but after some months it just all came out and hit me hard. \nYet I don't know if it's still normal to feel like this after 5 years.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Today could be the anniversary of a special day, maybe the cardinal outside your window is a reminder of the one you miss, or the rainbow following the storm was a sign of hope. I want you to know that it is okay to remember. I want you to know that it is only a myth that time heals. It is okay to feel bad. You never replace what you have lost and the conflicting emotions you have today are normal. I want you to know it is okay to think of the person you have lost and to wonder about how different life is now, now that the person you loved is gone.\n\nTo the individual I loved and lost:\n\nI want you to know that I think of you often. So many times I have wanted to pick up the phone and call you. I know it seems silly, I know you will not answer but I do wonder what you would say if we could talk. In my head I create scenarios. I come up with responses such as, \u201cblah, blah, blah\u2026 you don\u2019t know my life...\u201d or \u201cyes, anything you need Sweetie.\u201d I make decisions based on the opinion of someone I can no longer ask. The choices I make are sometimes based on words or phrases I can only imagine in my head since you\u2019re no longer here to say them out loud. We think of you all the time and wonder what corny joke would you have to share. What sarcastic comment would you make?\n\nOn the good days, I smile as I wonder what you\u2019re doing now. I wonder if you\u2019re dancing in the heavens, playing pranks, baking pies, gardening, farming the richest soil, riding the motorcycle on the most beautiful landscape imaginable, or if your toes are digging in the whitest sand overlooking the most beautiful sunset. I imagine you laughing, I imagine you at peace. I imagine those around you smiling because of the joy you bring. Then I pause, and I think, \u201cCrap. Did you just see me do that? Are you really watching over me? Over us?\u201d I wonder if you find humor in the silly things I do or the stumbles I may have. I wonder if you shake your head in disbelief at statements I make or jump up with excitement if I do something that makes you proud.\n\nI sit and I wonder. It\u2019s been quite the journey without you here. I know I am not the only one hurting. I know others miss you as well. I wonder if they think of you as often as I do or if they play out the scenarios in their head, replay your response, and look at photos and remember entire conversations. I hope you know you were loved; I pray you know how much you are missed.\n\nI sometimes wonder if you\u2019d forgive me for what I did or didn\u2019t do that caused you hurt when you were still here. I hope that now you see and know how much I really cared, how influential you actually were in my life. I regret I did not always tell you. If I told you a million times before how much I loved you, I wish I could tell you a million more. I know nothing in life is guaranteed, your time was up and I have to accept that. I can accept that you are no longer here and I will move forward, but I will not let go.\n\nI will move forward and forever have you influencing who I am, what I do, and the relationships that I develop. Who I am now is because of you. Grief is full of conflicting emotions and part of moving forward in my life is acknowledging what I lost when you left. You cannot be replaced. The role you had in my life has contributed to who I am, the experiences I have endured, the beliefs I have developed, and my perceptions regarding myself, others, the world, and my future.\n\nUntil I lost you. grief was a myth. It was something I had heard of but barely understood. I could sympathize with others but to empathize was hard. Every loss is personal; it is based on each individual relationship. To me you were a father, a brother, a grandparent. To someone else, you were a spouse, a son, a father. I cannot expect anyone else to get it, to understand the grief I have. Losing you was hard. Losing myself is not an option. I want to live, I want to experience, I want to move forward.\n\nI now know that time does not heal, that feeling bad is okay, that I can fill the empty chair but you can never be replaced, and that some things cannot be fixed. Not all wounds are meant to heal. Some wounds are meant to be remembered, the scars are lessons learned, tragedy we overcame, and hope for the future. Those wounds, those scars help me move forward. It allows me to focus on what I have presently, what I can do, the relationships I\u2019m building, and the memories I can create. I don\u2019t want to forget you and who you were, the good, the bad, and everything in between. I want you to know that although I wonder about you, I think of you often, I am moving forward in my life, and I\u2019m taking you with me.\n\nSource: http://www.sanduskyregister.com/story/201906240023", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Doctors called it broken heart syndrome.\n  \n  \nI haven\u2019t been able to cry about or really have any kind of reaction to either of these major events. Losing my brother wasn\u2019t entirely unexpected, he was a drug addict and an alcoholic who lived a rough life. We had a strained relationship, for reasons I don\u2019t really understand. But regardless of how strained and difficult it was, losing him still hurts so much that I sometimes feel like I can\u2019t breathe.

Thankfully she died in her sleep but her parents and siblings arrived before she fell asleep, so she knew she was with the people she was surrounded by people who loved her unconditionally. It was the real first time I was able to see my family together as we are a very dispatcher family. When my mum died I was 19 and my brother 16. The months after were hard but okay, I had a lot of paperwork to do, college, my friends and my brother was in a foster family and was also going to high school and was spending time with his friends. \nI decided 6 months after her death that I couldn\u2019t live in a country where my mum wasn\u2019t there anymore, so I literally ran away leaving everything behind. I started a new life with new friends, new college, new house, new job, everything was new, I was finally \u201chappy\u201d. My brother on the other hand, was not. He started to have suicidal thought and attempts, he has been fired from high school because he tried to kill him self in the toilet with a knife and the family can\u2019t keep him if he\u2019s not going to higher school or job. He\u2019s in a state of mind where he deserves everything and life is just a bunch of nonsense and bullshit. I\u2019m starting to think it\u2019s my fault in a way as I kind of left him behind when I left. \nSince the \u00ab\u00a0anniversary\u00a0\u00bb of her death, I\u2019ve been starting to get really sad for nothing and everything, I wrote to her a lot and I\u2019m still doing this, as it\u2019s like I\u2019m still speaking to her. But the more the months pass by, the more sad I feel. I miss her with all my heart and I just wish I could go back in time and save her, or at least spend more time with her. I don\u2019t know how to cope with this anymore, I thought I was fine, but I am not apparently.

When I was 17, I moved in with my grandparents. My parents are good parents, but at the time my mother and I would argue constantly. With their approval and my grandmothers help, I moved. I lived with them for nearly a full year and then the rest of my family moved in. My Nana, she was everything you'd want a person to be. She wasn't your average grandmother, no, she was far from that. She cooked and was sweet like most grandmothers, but me and her, we would stay up til midnight watching movies and playing games. We had a Nintendo 64 and I'd always get her to play Mario with me or we would play cards when we could find them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI graduated last May, and she was sick then. She had been on 24/7 oxygen since as long as I could remember but this time, she just couldnt make it to the field and sit in the heat. I understood that and was not upset. Im still not. My parents video taped it for her and my grandfather so they could see their only grand daughter walk the stage.\n\nLater that May I moved over 5 hours away to start college. College that she helped me take a loan out for. All she wanted was for me to be bigger than our small town. She wanted me to go to school and follow my dreams. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAugust 21st was the day I got the first call from my mother. They had been to the ER with my nana ans she was coming home. I thought it was good news until my mother told me she had to come home with Hospice; that she had been diagnosed with stage four brain cancer.  I contacted the dean of my school and took a leave of absence. I flew home it felt like, and when I got there, everything seemed normal almost. She was sitting in her wheel chair talking and we even played cards again. \n\nThat Saturday she was unresponsive all day. I thought she was just sleeping a lot since the night before she complained of a headache all night and had been sick. But around 4:25, she took her last breath. I clung to her feet at the edge of the hospital bed, begging for something to happen. I remember my aunt saying, \"Bye Nana.\" And just sinking to the floor the rest of the way. I dont remember how I made it to the living room with my parents.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo ones death has affected me like this. The first few months, her last months played through my mind all the time. I didnt sleep because it was all I would dream about. Hellish nightmares where she wasnt waking up. In January of this year, I turned 19.  Im supposed to graduate with a Bachelors degree next Decemeber. I've moved in with that same partner she liked before anyone else. So many things have happened that I wanted her to be apart of. And I feel like I miss her more and more every single day. She wont be there when I walk that bigger stage, she wont be there when we get married, she wont see her great grand children, she will never be to our home. Ill never get to see her again, hug her, anything. I was so angry with God in the beginning. And i think part of me still is. Nana was only in her 60s. She had so much time left with us.

She lived in Florida at the time and I live in Virginia. I am 22 and she was 59, about to turn 60 this July. I visited her once in April and it was extremely hard for me. I sat with her as she had multiple treatments and watched her mental state jump around. To see her in that state had me crying every time i left the hospital. I had no family with me and had to fly down alone since i have no car. \n\nShe came up to Pennsylvania last month to try and stay with my grandmother and uncle after the hospital leased her but was too ill and went straight back into the hospital in Pittsburgh. \nThe doctors informed me she was in very poor state and I reconsidered my previous plans to go and see her the second week of July. My grandmother and uncle told me to keep them and just see how she things would go the next few days. I agreed with them and stayed in contact with the hospital. Even though my friends suggested I go sooner, I felt I would have more time.\n\nI spoke to her last Saturday and she was aware of how sick she was ( she was previously in a very confused mental state) and even told me she had got up and walked on her own.  I was elated that she seemed to be doing better and even the doctors said she was improving.\n\nOn this Wednesday morning the doctor called me and told me she had suddenly gotten severely worse. She had under 24 hours to live. I immediately put a one way plane ticket on my credit card and went straight there with a bag of laundry pulled out the dryer.\n\nWhen I got to the hospital it was 1am, I never could\u2019ve imagined the state she would be in. I\u2019m sorry for being graphic but she had a ventilator down her throat, was unconscious, and her eyes just moved back and forth unblinking. I stayed by her side all night just holding her hand that didn\u2019t hold me back. At 11 that morning I decided to have her taken off life support, with the informed suggestion of her doctor. as her blood pressure was at an all time low and nothing was improving.  There was no other medicine they could give her or procedures to try, she was already above the legal dose just to keep her alive.\n\nI am wracked with guilt. All I could do these last few months is tell her I love her over and over again, I never thought our last phone call would really be the last. I am so disgusted with myself for not making the time to see her more when she needed me. To have to say goodbye to her while she was unresponsive and to see her in that state has absolutely destroyed me. \n\nI do not know how to deal with the regret I feel. She was so strong and i thought I would be able to see her again. I even had the means to go and see her and i just took my time.\n\nWondering if anyone else has been in these same circumstances and if they could offer any advice, thank you for reading.\n\n*Edit* 06/29/2019 // thank you everyone so much for the responses so far, it means a lot to hear from everyone and helps me to not feel as alone in this situation. My main regret has to be that I only saw her a handful of times in the last few years, so badly I wish I had taken the time to visit, or to be more present and loving when I did. However, I have to learn to accept that I cannot change that now. We both loved each other dearly, and no one could have ever known things would be cut so short. Please continue to share your stories, and if needed feel free to message me if you would like to talk.\nAgain, thank you all so much. //", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I lost my mom a week ago, and since then I've received a lot of support from my friends. I've been texting lots of them and a few were able to come to my mom's funeral, but other than that I've been staying with family and have not gotten a chance to really spend time with my friends again. Tomorrow, though, I am hanging out with friends for the first time since my mom passed. We are all in our early 20s, and I'm the only one who has lost a parent already. I've been hit with this massive feeling of embarrassment about it all. I'm embarrassed to have to face them now that my mom has died. I don't know why because my friends have been nothing but great to me, and my mom was sick so it wasn't a shock, but I feel so self-conscious. I don't like to be the center of attention, and I don't want people to feel sorry for me, so I guess I am dreading having to be faced with questions about how I am. At the same time, I feel so different, and I'm worried I won't find comfort in them like I used to. It's almost like a feeling of shyness. I feel like I need to go spend time with my friends for my own good, but I can't shake this embarrassed feeling. \n\nHas anybody else gone through this intense feeling of embarrassment when facing people after losing someone? How do you cope with wanting to see people but not wanting to deal with the cringey-ness of everyone offering their sympathies, asking questions, etc.? I don't want this embarrassment to drive me into isolation, but I also don't want to be dreading every get-together I have because of this feeling.

He was a happy man on the outside but dealt with a lot of obstacles in his life. Disabled, diabetic, alcoholic, and lived alone for a long time. He took me and my sister and nephew in when we didn\u2019t have another place to go. He joked with me and bought me pot. He drank with us and was an ass. He always said he was happy as a clam. \nI can never forget the day I showed up to his house, my sister was at work worried about him. \nI walked in, house was a mess. We thought it was just another drunken episode. He scared me. Sitting in his chair. Disoriented. Didn\u2019t know who I was. Sounded drunk but really, he was dying. He had been dying for a long time but no one really knew how serious and close he was to this. He was in denial and so were we. I called my dad, scared, in a panic. Do I call 911 or will he snap out of it? The paramedics told me to preform cpr. I didn\u2019t think he was breathing, but I couldn\u2019t lift him off his chair. I was scared, I was cpr certified but I\u2019m so weak. I cried until they got here. I panicked as they reported the house as unconditional to live in. I left and went on with my night. I partied that night. I was such a mess. I didn\u2019t care about myself. The next day I visited him in the icu. He was coherent and receptive. Things needed to change. We needed to call in a hospice. Change his lifestyle. We made grand plans. We laughed. We knew life would change and I\u2019d move back in to help. It was going to be okay. Before I left to party (again) that night, I helped him clear his throat. I stuck my fingers in his mouth to help him. I couldn\u2019t help him. He was unable to spit properly. I should have known. The next day, I met with my sister. We headed to the hospital. We laughed walking in and cried walking out. We had been too late. As we walked through the doors of the icu, straight ahead was his room. Monitors were unplugged. His bed was all the way down. I froze. I looked at my sister with a jaw drop. A nurse approached us and asked if we went here for bed # ? I started shaking. The dr came and explained the time of death was just 10 minutes ago. I fell apart. I dropped and howled and kicked and cried. I fucked up. I was late to the meetup with my sister. We missed the phone call from my grandpa. I walked in on death and I will never reduce the scars of that image it left me. We went into the room and cried for a long time. We held his cold hand, hugged and said our final words that were spoken to a fucking ghost. To a lifeless body. \nSo much pain. \nMy dad was going to come see him. He was on his way when his cousin sent him a fucking picture of my dead uncles face. \n\nI\u2019ve dealt with grief, my mom, grandma and too many friends died before I was 16. I haven\u2019t felt the pain like this before. Today is tough. Someone once told me that grief comes in waves. It doesn\u2019t get better. You get used to the pain. \n\nToday I don\u2019t feel used to it. I feel guilt. What about all those times I could have and should have stopped by his pad to say hi? How selfish was I because I didn\u2019t want to waste 30 minutes of my fucking life to visit my home bound uncle. I feel angry for that. I feel sad. I lost a good man who made me laugh, who would listen to me and love us unconditionally. I feel scarred. Life won\u2019t be the same. I\u2019m only 23. I know death is a paved road ahead of me. I cry after thoughts. I\u2019ll have to see my dad and grandpa and others die. It\u2019s so fucking painful. \n\nThankful for a reddit sub like this one. Anyone on here truly gets it. The undescribable pain. Thank you for reading. I had to sit down to write this. I will cry and move forward with my night. Life is still hopeful and full of great things.

Sometimes we talked every single day after I left (mainly about our publication but other things, too). Sometimes he woke me up sending me a thousand texts about our paper or something that happened or just messing with me. We maintained our friendship, and I was grateful for that.\n\nHe was like an older brother to me. I hadn't really gotten close to people like that before. He helped me to grow. We had a lot of deep conversations. He told me things most people did not know. I did the same. He was the last person I saw before leaving because he took me to the airport. I'm so grateful for that 1.5 hour car ride now more than ever. \n\nWe used to say we'd see each other again. I was going to hire him one day to help dive with me to conduct research. I was going to photograph his wedding. He and his girlfriend wanted to visit me someday in the States. Now, that isn't possible.\n\nI miss him terribly. But he would want me to continue with life. I know him well enough to know what he would have said to me. But, I still miss him and it still hurts.\n\nAll of my friends are together down there. The night he died, they stayed together all night and all the next day. I had to force myself to try to sleep before I got up early to do the hour drive to my site where I had to teach science to kids all day. I couldn't be in a wreck, too. I went to work and put on a brave face for those kids, just like he would have wanted to. I couldn't think about him in the car. I had to focus.\n\nI broke down at work. I broke down the next morning and sobbed all morning. I saw my face in a mirror at the store and scared myself with my dead eyes and my pale skin. I barely looked like me. \n\nI feel so freaking alone. They were all together... and no one had time to call me or check in on me. They thankfully thought to call me when it happened, I can't imagine if I had found out while at work. But after that, all lines were silent. Eventually a few messages came in and one kind person did think to call. But there was one other person who worked with me and my friend. We three were so close, or at least I thought. I texted him a lot to make sure he was ok, because I knew he wasn't and I wanted to be there for him like he always was for me. I needed him, too. He was the only one who really knew what the three of us had. He finally sent me a somewhat generic response, and even though I asked him to call me he hasn't. I'm furious at him. I know that he is going to grieve how he needs to and that it might hurt him to call and talk to me. Or that maybe we weren't as close as I thought. But I'm still angry. I lost one friend, I deeply do not want to lose another one. He was already barely in contact with me after I left. I feel so freaking selfish for feeling like this and like I need him and like I want other people to contact me or be available to talk. They are going to grieve how they are going to grieve. I don't want to intrude. I don't want to be selfish or make it worse. And I don't want to call and never hear them pick up. My mom is trying to help but she is making it so much worse, but I don't have the heart to tell her that. She's grieving a separate thing and she is not in a place to handle that right now. I have sent a few texts asking people how they are doing. I wanted to make sure they knew someone cared because I didn't want them to feel like what I did.\n\nI feel horrible for his girlfriend. They loved each other so deeply. I try to send her at least a little text everyday to let her know she is cared for. I told her she can feel however she needs to and that she will survive. I hope she doesn't feel bad that I text her every day. I hope I'm not intruding. But we are friends, too, and I want to be there for her. I know what it feels like when no one is checking in on you or when people come in telling you how to feel. I just want her to know that she's valid and so are her feelings and that I am here for her.\n\nI made a Google Drive where we could all share photos and videos that we had of him to send to his family and girlfriend. I put up everything I had. Some of those photos had never seen the light of day. No one else has uploaded anything to the folder, although I cannot be angry at them for not doing so. They may not be able to handle that right now, and that is ok. I forgive them. But I'm still a little angry, because per usual it's me doing everything and everyone else watching it happening, using those photos, and not helping to add to the project. They keep posting all the photos I uploaded. Many of those moments were ones where none of them were there. Gosh, I wish I took more photos of him. He hated having them taken, but once he knew that I was a photographer and saw my photos, I was one of the few people he trusted to take his photo. Everyone uploads all those photos I took and everyone else comments on their photos and sends them condolences. None to me. \"You're just not as torn apart as they are.\" I am, they just don't see it. And dang it I feel so selfish for feeling like this, I feel like a horrible person. I can't say that he meant more or less to them. That's not fair, that's not how it works. We are all hurting. We are all allowed to grieve how we need to.\n\nI am alone, sad, and don't even know what to do. I can do normal things, I'm not eating as well as I should but I can sleep better now and do other things. It comes and goes in waves, that's normal. I have a Psychology minor so I have a general idea of how this goes (which is to say however it goes is perfectly normal, I just have to let myself feel whatever is thrown at me). How do I deal with this alone? Am I selfish? I feel like no one really knew what he and I had, so they think I'm just some outsider putting on a show. I'm sorry for the long post, but after thinking about it for awhile I decided it's better to ask for help rather than sit it out alone.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I feel remorse shame sadness and at times nothing. My grandma was a long distance grandma that we never met physically until 2017 and my mom made us have a relationship with her despite distance. She would be the first to call me on all my birthdays from Central America. I used to daydream of being with her and meeting her I basically idolized that woman growing up as a child I never got tired of looking at pictures of her. Later I started suffering from depression and it was 2017 I wasn\u2019t as enthusiastic about anything even meeting her but I swear once we got to that airport and we brought her home with us for the first time I feel like I grew so attached to her very fast. I remember joking inappropriately once and she kept laughing so much telling me to repeat it again and now when I think about it I cry. She always said I was very pretty when I felt at my lowest and when I was isolated and sad she noticed and tried to make me feel included. I miss her hugs and touching her soft hands she was so funny and kind. She wanted me to go to her home country with her and asked me so many times and I said no and now I am here wishing I could go back in time and book a flight and go with her. She wanted to go with me only out of all her grandsons and begged my mom to get me my passport for the longest time and I didn\u2019t go because I\u2019m an idiot. She got a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in summer 2018 and since then she hasn\u2019t been the same lady that had the ability to bright up the entire room. She became tired defeated and was in agony all the time. I didn\u2019t feel this year at all but we all saw how she get deteriorating very quickly. She was gone 1 year after receiving diagnosis. In her last months once I kneeled down beside her bed and put my head on her pillow hugging her and she rubbed my head with her weak skinny hands and she said \u201c don\u2019t cry when I get cured we\u2019ll go to my home country together me and you\u201d and I felt like I broke into pieces. I don\u2019t even want to talk about her funeral it was a genuine awful experience. I only had her with me for 2 years. I cried everyday for a week after she died sometimes losing control. I feel guilty about a lot of things and I wish I had a time machine to hug her and tell her how much i love her again. I only had her with me physically for two years and I feel she had a huge impact in my life even when we only talked through the phone I want to get over this how do I get over it???", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I\u2019m honestly just really sad and need to get this off my chest. \n\nMy mom passed away almost 4 years ago - July 2015. My grief counselor always tells me that our subconscious and our body take a lot longer to grieve than our conscious mind. I\u2019m aware my mom is gone but there is such a gaping hole where she used to be and there\u2019s a part of me that is still not okay with it yet. Whenever it starts getting hot and July is approaching, I start to feel it. It\u2019s like something in my mind just clicks and I feel sad. My anxiety heightens. I doubt everything, I don\u2019t want to do anything. I feel depressed. Every single summer, like clock work. \n\nJuly 2015, my mom was in the end stages of small cell lung cancer. I was only 21 and I was naive to the severity. I honestly thought that with enough treatment she would make it. My family, including her, kind of kept me in the dark. My mom was not herself that summer. She was mean, resentful, accusatory, not mentally there. Of course though I didn\u2019t think it was from her dying, I just thought she was being mean. And I hated it. So I spent a lot of time keeping myself busy with my boyfriend at the time or with friends. I remember July 4th I went away for the weekend and I came back to find out that my mom fell and needed constant supervision to care for her. I remember feeling so guilty doing anything that weekend. I still feel so guilty for so many things. For not being there enough. For not doing more. But again, I was a dumb 21 year  old who didn\u2019t want to lose her best friend. What was I supposed to do?\n\nI feel angry that July is basically here. I\u2019m mad and I want to kick a wall, scream and sob. I hate that this month exists and I hate that my mom is gone. There\u2019s a part of me that feels pathetic - like get a fucking grip. But there\u2019s a bigger part of me that just can\u2019t. \n\nAnyway, if this month is hard on anyone else my heart is truly with you and I hope you\u2019re doing what you need to care for yourself.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}
{"post_id": "c7kopz", "created_utc": 1561934603, "title": "Ignoring grief doesn't make it go away", "author": "wereno2", "self_text": "TL:DR at end\n\nMy dad died in 2004 when I was 18. He contracted HIV from a girlfriend the year before but it wasn't discovered until he sought treatment for bronchitis. There were only two months between diagnosis and his death due to complications. \n\nHe died 3 weeks before I started college. I started dating my husband in February the following year. I self-sabotaged my grades my junior and senior year of college and did not graduate. I got married in 2008 and began working retail full-time after that. \n\nIt is now 2019 and I find myself grieving still or finally (I'm not sure which). I had a good relationship with my dad. I found myself pulling away from his family in the years after he died. I'd lost two cousins and an Aunt from that side of the family, so grief wasn't new. The separation was due to two things. The family grieves differently than I do. For example, my Aunt whose daughter passed at 5yo from an auto immune disease still signs my cousins name in Christmas and birthday cards. She also had left her bedroom virtually untouched for years (my cousin would be in her 20s now). The second reason is my uncle.\n\nMy dad's family has strong genes. Many of my the men bare a strong resemblance to each other except my dad's oldest brother. They look exactly alike. Face, build, hair, mannerisms, voice etc. The day my dad died my uncle came to the hospital and I remember hugging him and crying for a long time because he felt like my dad before he got sick. It was weird and comforting at the same time. \n\nIn the years following my dad death I tried to bury my grief with school, friends, work, and my relationship with my husband. When family events came up I could never attend because of work or school. I realized that I was avoiding the family because I never really accepted his death and I just blocked out the pain. \n\nI was invited again to a family gathering but this time I made myself go. Leading up to it I was having a good amount of anxiety. We were welcomed with open arms and lots of questions about where we've been etc. Two of my Aunts brought up my dad and how much they miss him which made me uncomfortable but I just tried to ignore it. When I saw my Uncle I just said hi and avoided him the whole time. I didn't catch up, no hug, no goodbye. We got in the car to go home and chatted about seeing everyone and I just started crying. \n\nToday has been rough. I feel like a trash person for avoiding my relatives and worse for avoiding my Uncle. The man has never done anything wrong. \n\nI dont know where to go from here. It feels like the grieving process is starting all over again. I want to have a relationship with my family but its very painful even after all this time. \n\nTL:DR My dad died 15 years ago and I never processed my grief but isolated myself from his family. I saw them yesterday and now I feel like garbage. \n\nHas this happened to anyone else? What helped?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}
