My daughter after three years of being a single mother has gone to live with her father because I am not in the right State of mind to raise her on my own my narcissistic ex is not her father but he has been in her life since she was 6 months old and she calls him dad and she never asks me about her real father even though that is who she lives with and has been living with for some time now she loves my ex-boyfriend like her own dad even though she doesn't understand the abuse I went through or the fact that he has watched us struggle and sat by and did absolutely nothing to help us. my major point of this post is just to let others know that if you are in some kind of situation like I am you are not alone you have a support system you have not lost it all you can always rebuild that's what I'm doing now I am getting back into school I'm going back to church I'm rebuilding my life again and I to need help and support and care and patience because my family even though I have left him and have notified my family and friends they don't believe me they believe that I will eventually get back with him and go through this all over again but I'm not I have had enough and I need help to keep my word to show my family that  this is really the end. I also need some advice on how to respond to my daughter when she asks me where her dad is or is her dad here or is her dad coming to see her, I need help working out the answers that I don't have her ones that she will understand because she's only three and she obviously doesn't understand why her so-called Father figure is no longer in her life anymore I just don't know how to help her understand that he is bad and not good and has never made any kind of attempt to make her life better in any way I don't know how to tell her that the man she loves so much and think so highly of has threatened to have her taken away from me.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I\u2019m acting like a person I never thought I was over someone I dont even know if I like. I don\u2019t get it. Is it love addiction, obsession,  or do I hate myself? \n\nDated this guy for about three months. I didn\u2019t really like him in the beginning, His vanity was really offputting and I couldn\u2019t see myself with someone like that. but when he started love bombing me I was actually surprised and let my guard up a little bit. We start seeing each other regularly, but he Was always double booking me like only wanted to see me when it was convenient for him, or we would work out together etc. etc. after time I started feeling needy because I felt like my needs were not being met. It always felt like when we hung outhitting night as well have been alone. Like he would asked me to go to the gym with him or to come over and cook for him or we would go get coffee and work. \n\nI tell him I feel we need to spend more quality time, and if that means we spend less time then that is OK. Things start to change and he starts to detach. I won\u2019t hear from him a few days.. and when I do see him he\u2019s telling me that I\u2019m asking for too much or im too needy, He never wants to give me an exact time for when we are going to meet so I literally have to leave my day open,he texts less and less . it got to the point to where I just wasn\u2019t feeling good about myself so I cut it off. When I left him he didn\u2019t argue he was extremely cold about it just was like ok and gave me back my parking pass. \n\nI had one relapse when I was drinking and I ran into him, and I really wanted him to give me some attention cause I missed him so much, I tried to go home with him and he just kept rejecting my advances but the more he rejected me the more I wanted him. He complained about me latching on but really allowed it to go on if you know what I mean. He even dropped me back at my house in an Uber crying. It left me feeling really Low. I sent him a bunch of cringe lovey text messages and . And he said goodnight and never replied again. But I know I don\u2019t want to be with this person. What is wrong with me? \n\nSince then I\u2019ve been kind of obsessing over him. I\u2019ve been watching his Instagram stories from my creeper account. And lately he\u2019s been posting things that are hard to decipher, Like I can\u2019t tell if they are jabs at me. Like for instance He posted a  story hiking, which was ironic because the day we broke up we were supposed to go hiking and he canceled. He never goes hiking alone,And most recently he posted a story of breakfast and it said \u201cthanks bae\u201d. I know that he is seeing other people just from digging, And I know I have a problem and I should just stop myself from questioning why he is doing these type of things and if it is because he\u2019s trying to get at me. We were together for a while and I cooked for him all the time and he never posted pictures of it or anything like that with me or the stuff we do together. Which is why I think he\u2019s doing this because  he knows I\u2019m watching. I know there are a few girls not just one. But what joy does he get out of showing me? Is he trying to make me jealous? He doesn\u2019t even text me or try to contact me and that makes me feel like shit. Maybe I\u2019m the narcissist? But I don\u2019t think I am because I always make excuses for him. Does anyone else ever feel like this? Like they can\u2019t tell if the other person is actually as bad as they think or if it\u2019s just a defense mechanism they developed in their head because they know they\u2019re hard to deal with.. \n\nI know that they are directed towards me, I will get pleasure from that. And I think about that and I realize that it\u2019s super fucked up. Like why would him trying to make me jealous actually make me want him? I\u2019ve deleted my stalker account and stopped watching what he\u2019s doing, it\u2019s like obsessive. But I still cannot get him out of my head and it\u2019s just really hard. I feel like all this rejection, ignoring , and posting how he\u2019s like so moved on has really hurt my confidence. I\u2019ve been going to therapy and I know we\u2019re not right for each other but why can\u2019t I just happily move on from someone who I didn\u2019t really want that much in the first place, but now he just clearly doesn\u2019t want me. I keep looking back at my head and replaying things I could\u2019ve done differently in the relationship, and maybe he would be towards me like how he was in the beginning, just so sweet and always so surprising. Now I just feel like I got tricked, and I kind of blame myself because I think I didn\u2019t play the game well enough. Maybe if I had then I wouldn\u2019t be longing for him so much and I would still be in control of my own emotions.\ufffc it\u2019s been about 3 weeks since we officially broke up but it feels like months. I just want this to be over but I feel like my mind is infected. I went and looked through all our old text threads and watched the decline of the relationship, it really made me sad. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t even tell if it\u2019s him or if it\u2019s me, he always told me that I was so extremely selfish. And I know I can be selfish but I really felt like I was trying to do my best with us. I just feel so stuck.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I have a really small circle of friends i actually trust, and most of them are online. The loneliness has felt crippling and is now accompanied by depression and a strong case of generalized anxiety. Also, im gay, and struggling to relate to the community as a whole (club scene is not for me). I mostly meet new people through my artistic projects. The issue being, im not sure how i could ever fathom opening my heart to someone new.

Anyways I was with a guy for at least 8 months during this time he started out sweet. But quickly turned to only talking about my body, which I told him I was self conscious about. He started to sexualize every aspect of our relationship. I told him I wasn\u2019t comfortable with anything sexual as I am 17 and he told me to \u201cjust do it.\u201d And \u201cif you really loved me you would.\u201d I asked him over and over again if he only was in this relationship to have a sexual partner and repeatedly was told no that I was blowing it out of proportion. Soon he convinced me to send nudes and would rate them and tell me which ones to take next. Even if I kept saying I didn\u2019t want to. He would also get mad at me for not spending enough time with him. As my dad was unemployed for 2 years and we had debts to pay I got a job. So my days were pretty filled. I told him this and he said that I didn\u2019t need a job and only needed to spend time with him. I have depression and anxiety and he would tell me to lighten up and how much I affected his day, by being open and apologizing for me not being too happy. He would grab me in inappropriate areas only when we were in school or in band together. Surrounded by others I told him that he couldn\u2019t do that. But he kept going. Soon I gave my virginity to him. I don\u2019t know why, I just felt obligated to do so. He said he was happy and treated me fairly nice after that. My sister found out and told him to piss off because I was constantly crying from just being around him. He told me that I should grow up and not rely on others to help me. We broke up after I found out that he groped me while I was asleep. Admitted to doing so and told me that it was my fault as he thought that I was awake and was totally enjoying it. At this I cracked and broke up with him. He kept texting me telling me he would do better then suddenly getting mad when I didn\u2019t respond. He told him mom and I told mine who did get really pissed and contacted his parents who said that boys will be boys. We didn\u2019t talk much and soon band season started up again. There he constantly brings up our relationship and critics everything I do, calls me stupid, below him and that I should just leave.

I will try to make it not sound super graphic or detailed, but that will be hard to avoid. \n\nBasically, she made me \"clean out\" my vagina because she claimed it was \"dirty\". She would make me do this with body wash or bar soap and very hot water. I would have to put soap into my vagina with the hot water, and if I couldn't do it because it hurt too bad, she would do it instead. She would yell and berate me the entire time for whatever reason she could come up with.  I'm fuzzy on the year(s) this took place (as the whole abuse and CPS stuff blurs together in my head) but I think I was around 10. \n\nI never bothered to report it because it kind of paled in comparison to the other things she did (CPS was already getting involved for other things). It's honestly one of my biggest regrets. I didn't know if it would classify as sexual abuse then and I don't know what type of  abuse this falls under anymore.

Me trying to approach him about something I perceived as an issue \u2013 he'd take it as me trying to attack him and would just rage. And/or then ignore me for a few days. Me asking for advice \u2013 he'd get angry if I didn't agree with his solution/point of view. He'd claim I was making stuff up. To the point where I often found myself trying to quote our old texts to prove I wasn't making stuff up, and that we really HAD talked about something in the past.  \n \n\nI asked many times if we could discuss stuff calmly but he just couldn't be reasoned with  - even me just asking that would 90% of the time trigger a huge fight\u2026 he'd name call and drag up \u00bbthat time 3 years ago you did insert-bad-thing, you're being a controlling/shitty/entitled person now\".  \n   \n \n\nHe hated basically all of my friends. For a while if someone liked my social media posts (especially if it was a picture of me) he'd get jealous and ask me to block them/stop talking to them\u2026 or if I mentioned (since I still had the hobby of video games) I'd be playing something with a guy friend or a mixed group \u2013 I'd get him trying to guilt me into not spending time with them \u00bbI see, you find it more fun to do stuff with THEM rather than me\u00ab\n\nHe also attacked my insecurities and would say stuff like \u00bbyeah, by the way, you really are shit at X thing\u00ab during arguments or if I tried to talk about it.\n\nHe claimed I was trying to guilt him into not going out and doing stuff on his own, he said I was \u00bbjust moping when he's out\u00ab.  \n I figured OK, maybe he had a point. I did feel like some of my social life kinda died over the years and maybe I was relying on him too much. So I started organising my own movie/gaming nights with a group of friends when I knew he'd be out on weekends. But if I mentioned having a glass of wine or anything being less than 100% perfect while he was out he'd start going on about me \u00bbwhining and moping when he's not around\u00ab\n\nIt wasn't ok for me to text him about our plans when he was running late or flaked, but if his plans fell through he'd sulk if I then told him I'd already made plans of my own for the night, or that I needed some time to wrap up whatever it was I was doing before I could do stuff with him.\n\nAnd then last year happened. He suddenly started acting really cold. Claiming I'd been \u00bbstealing all his free time\u00ab (this is a guy who'd come home and play video games for 4-5h before even talking to me and I never said anything), making him miserable, and trying to control him. When asked if everything was OK and if he wanted to end stuff \u2013 he raged and said I was the one doubting him.\n\nThen almost 2 months later he \u00bbconfessed he had a drunk 1 night stand\u00ab. He begged and cried and promised so much. I was really hurt but offered one (and only) 2nd chance since I'd never thought he'd be capable of anything like that before\u2026 Now I know it wasn't a 1 night stand, it was a month and a half long affair. He made her sound like an obsessed psycho who'd stalk him and wouldn't leave him or his friends alone and \u00bbhe was worried about her because she sounded so depressed\u00ab.  \n \n\nBut SHE told me he told her he was \u00bbscared to officially break up with me because he was worried I'd hurt myself because I have anxiety\u00ab. Again, something I found out later.\n\nFor a good half a year everything seemed good. Then I noticed arguments getting more frequent and he'd flake on me more often again. But then sometimes he'd be nice, or he'd talk about buying us concert tickets for an event next year or us finding an apartment together. If I asked if everything was OK he'd accuse me of doubting him.  \n \n\nI spent a week with him last month and he seemed OK the first half of the visit, then a bit less affectionate. I figured maybe it was stress. I got home and he broke up with me the same day because \u00bbjust not feeling it anymore\u00ab. Then I see the person from last year being added on social media by him/his current housemates, and her new relationship status \u2013 again, the same day.\n\nI got contacted by one of his friends and a mutual friend of him and her. And I did text one of his friends myself, because too much was going on for me to ignore, and at first I just worried about him because he was acting strange.\n\nHe'd been seeing her again since February this year.  \n He'd been telling his family and his old housemates (lived with them up until the last week of June) that he wanted me to move in with him. He told HER we never even spoke about living with eachother.\n\nWe wanted to go to a festival together and after a while he started saying it would be expensive for me (true) so I decided to skip it. Turns out he found out she was probably going so didn't want me around anymore.\n\nShe was apparently following some of my social media and freaked out when I posted about me visiting him. I think he told her he was breaking up with me/not serious with me anymore and then she saw me posting couple stuff and was upset. He told her he didn't know I was coming to stay with him for a week, that I'd just gone and bought plane tickets without consulting him. He was with me in a Skype call as I bought them, and he'd been talking to me about the dates he could get time off at work for weeks.\n\nI was in such a bad mental state at that point I posted online about what happened (no full names involved, mine or his) \u2013 that we broke up and he'd been cheating\u2026 He freaked out on me, threatened to call the police and sue me for libel/defamation, even got his mother involved.\n\nThen the biggest mind-f\\*ck.   \n I asked him why, if he knew he wanted someone else/was already with someone else, he didn't just talk to me about it. He'd had 6 months to do it. And why he'd sleep with me during the visit.  \n He freaked out, started screaming at me that I was making it up, that he'd never touched me, then started crying. I think his new gf was sitting next to him when I asked him that.   \n \n\nHis new gf started contacting me, accusing me of making stuff up and trying to ruin their relationship. And it got to me so much that even now, 2 weeks later, i still don't trust my memories 100% and it's too fuzzy to recall. \n\nHe told some of his friends that I didn't like them, that they shouldn't talk to me/should block me, and that I was trying to \u00bbruin him\u00ab. \n\nHe made it sound like he was the one who had it so hard because he was forced to choose between 2 people. When all I was really upset about was the 6 months of lies. It was so \"me me me\" I couldn't believe it.\n\nIt feels like my sense of reality basically got destroyed.\n\nWhere do I go from here?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Most of the thoughts are angry/hostile/violent/depressing. What can I do to heal?\n\n(Posting here because a mod took it down from r/relationships and referred me to this sub. Sorry if it is inappropriate for this sub, I\u2019m very new here. Possible trigger warning for verbal/emotional abuse and sexual harassment/assault.)\n\n\u2014\n\nOver a year ago, I (21F) started dating one of my best friends in college (23M). Before we even made it to the two month mark in our romantic relationship, I had noticed some red flags. Namely, he would not respect when I told him to stop calling me names like \u201cdumb slut\u201d or \u201cstupid bitch.\u201d I would often take the time to explain to him that it made me feel uncomfortable and insecure not only about my intellect/sexuality but also about whether he even liked me as a girlfriend. He would not apologize but rather say, oh c\u2019mon, I\u2019m just teasing. But he would continue to call me those names for the 9-11 months we were together.\n\nFor months ~2-6 in our relationship, I was depressed. I wanted to blame it on the birth control I had started taking shortly after we began dating, but I quit birth control before month 3, and my depression got worse thereafter. My then-boyfriend tried to support me in some ways, but for the most part he was emotionally unavailable and would spend less and less time with me. \n\nMentally, I went to great lengths not to justify my depression in terms of my then-boyfriend, even though many of my triggers were related to the things he would say to me and the way I felt disrespected by him. The thought of me breaking up with him was also triggering to me, so I bottled up my animosity toward him. Eventually, in month 7, I was no longer feeling particularly depressed and my former triggers were not bothering me so much. I decided I need to work at the relationship (even more than I had) before I could rationally break up with him.\n\nWe had a number of other incompatibilities, a primary one being sexual\u2014we were virgins when we met, and after having sex a few times, he told me he didn\u2019t like it. Throughout the relationship, I tried to communicate with him, figure out if there was some way to help him enjoy sex, or if there was a better compromise for our discrepancy in our sex drives than having sex once every other week when I wanted it at least a few times a week. But he was stubborn and didn\u2019t put in nearly the amount of work into resolving our problems that I did.\n\nAround month 8, he texted me saying we should break up in a few months before he would move to another state for grad school (around month 11). While I agreed, I was so angry with him for doing it over text and then falling asleep during our conversation, leaving me up all night to deal with my emotions alone.\n\nIn month 9, I decided he wasn\u2019t around me enough outside of class to merit calling it a relationship, and we weren\u2019t having sex often enough to keep me satisfied. So I broke up with him\u2014over text because he was out of town and I wanted to do it ASAP, and perhaps because I was petty that he had hurt me in the same way. I wanted to hook up with new people, people who actually like sex like I like sex. Breaking up with him felt unusually liberating. But then when my ex returned to town, he showed up unannounced at my apartment just to have sex with me and tell me if I ever started seeing someone else, the physical part of our relationship would be over. I should\u2019ve said good riddance to him right there (or not let him in my apartment at all), but I was still emotionally vulnerable and he took advantage of that.\n\nWe would continue to hook up in months 9-11. You\u2019d better believe he was still calling me a dumb slut/bitch like I\u2019d told him many times before not to. What\u2019s worse is the last time I saw him in month 11, I told him I didn\u2019t want to have sex, but he kept cuddling me and kissing me and touching me trying to turn me on, and we ended up having sex anyway. During sex, without asking and with no prior precedent for it in our history together, he slapped me in the face. Hard enough for me to momentarily lose hearing. So, I was quite distracted that I didn\u2019t see the second hit coming. After sex, we said our last goodbyes.\n\nIf he truly didn\u2019t like sex as he so insisted, then the only way I could rationalize his behavior was that he wanted to hurt me. I realize now (almost 4 months since we broke up\u2014it is now month 15 by this timeline) that I really really didn\u2019t deserve to be treated like shit like that.\n\nHaving reflected on his abusive actions, I find myself more cynical when it comes to romance and sex, even though I\u2019ve been able to find someone who (I think) treats me so much better than he did. Moreover, I am haunted by our traumatic relationship. I think about it every morning and night, but believe me\u2014I don\u2019t want to. These thoughts are sometimes violent and, aside from me remembering his aggression towards me, they sometimes involve me hurting him back. \n\nI\u2019m tired of feeling angry and hurt. I hate that I\u2019m still insecure about the things he used to pick on me for. \n\nI want to move on and stop obsessing over this past trauma. Do I need to forgive my ex? Do I need to forgive myself for not leaving him when I first had my doubts? Do I just distract myself so I don\u2019t think about him at all? How do I stop thinking about him when everything from being at school to lying down in bed seems to remind me of him?", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Since he had started repeatedly using \"anxiety\" as an excuse for his behavior towards me, I was thrilled. This was short lived.There was oddness afoot, and now I am looking back at my time with him, trying to make sense of it all. Since he lied to both me and his previous wife for at minimum, a decade, I now assume everything was a lie, or at least, less than the full truth.\n\nThese are observations I had, &amp; questions I have come up with that I would love some insight on...\n\n1. He mentioned some \"irregularities\" with how his therapist was assigned to him, which seemed odd since what he described seemed unlikely.\n2. He would tell me that his new \"therapist\" would frequently bring up him sending pictures of him and his daughter, and discussing how she had clients that would send her nudes &amp; dick-pics, and insinuate that maybe he shouldn't (or should?) do that with her, but \"family\" pics would be great. This sounds all sorts of wrong and unethical, I had a hard time believing this when he told me...\n3. He would often come home VERY late, and complain that he was in his car at work waiting for her \\[the \"therapist\"\\] to call in for a session, but that she would be late very often and ask him to wait longer or take calls during time when we needed him to be present.\n\nAfter reading all I have read, I realize he was/is ABSOLUTELY a covert type narcissist. In retrospect, this is all incredibly clear. It took my oldest friend and a lawyer to convince me that his abusive treatment was textbook, and as a result, I did everything in my power to cut him out of everything I could, despite his continued power grabs. What confuses me about the therapy described above was, WHY THE HELL WOULD HE ACTUALLY GO TO THERAPY VOLUNTARILY? Was this just a ploy to convince me that he was truly damaged by me so he could have more ammo (even if it was lies) when he discarded me? Or is it more likely that he was never really working with an actual therapist in the first place?\n\nI realize this line of thinking is not really helpful in the long run, but it just baffles me... Out of all of the horrible things he did, especially the little digs, power-grabs, devaluing and smear campaigns, this is the thing that now confuses me. I am just hoping someone here may be able to shed some light on what this may have been.   \n\n\nThank you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Nex had claimed he was seeing a therapist \\[pre-discard\\] who made sexual comments &amp; kept him unavailable.

So i'm pretty sure my mom is bipolar, because my older sister is and my great aunt is so it runs in the family i guess, But like it's hard to explain i'll try my best.   \nShe treats me differently than the rest of the family, i'm the one everyone always picks on, even when i'm in the room and i'm silently she'll always find a way to make everyone laugh at me and make me cry and even worse is that when i cry she just laughs louder, sometimes she'll even get angry at me for crying and start making fun of me with a someone mocking voice and start calling me a \"snowflake\" or call me by my older sisters name. She's never liked me or my sister but she practically worships my brothers and it honestly makes me sick. My dad used to side with me but lately it seems like he just sides with her so he doesn't get yelled at by her.   \nNow about the hating me and my sister thing, i can understand being upset with my sister because to be fair she's really not at all that smart (she tried to tell me red panda's didn't exist until i googled it for her), and my sister used to run off at night when she was younger and go hang out with her friends or boys from what i remember. My sister didn't live with us very long, i think the last time she lived with us was when she was maybe 15 or 16 but i'm not sure because I was so young, she went to live with my great grandma and for the longest time my mom tried to make me hate my great grandma and my sister and i didn't understand why because I was younger like maybe 6-7. I was always a good kid and i usually never did anything wrong but i noticed that my punishments even as a kid were a lot different then my brothers, even over little things like walking home by myself because my mom didn't show up early enough and i ended up making it home before she did so my older brother told me my mom went to go get me (my school was like a block or two away at the time) so I was like okay i'll meet her halfway and walked back but didn't see her, by the time i turned around and got home my mom was there and she started screaming at me and i didn't know what i did wrong now this was years ago, i'm 19 now and still remember this, she beat my ass right in public then made me go back inside, i proceeded to get grounded for a week from everything, i wasn't allowed to do anything. Meanwhile my older brother who was about 12 or so at the time would just be allowed to walk anywhere he wanted and she'd never yell at him. In fact she applauded him over the simplest of things.   \nSkipping past that and years later when i'm about 13 i got bullied like hell in middle school to the point that I was too depressed and anxiety ridden to go to school, which led to the principal leading me to his office and glaring at me until I started crying (I was a 13 year old and was already going through bullying that the school ignored and they got pissed at me) the principal told me to get the fuck out of his office, he legit said this which only made me cry more because again i didn't know what the freak i did wrong.   \nEventually I was home all the time and depressed and just laid around all the time and it sucked because I lived in a flimsy walled trailer where you could hear anything going on in the house and I heard my mom say that she regretted having kids especially me because I ruined her life, well that's her fault for opening her legs right? and besides I was her THIRD child, how could I have been the one to \"ruin\" her life. Well that shit stuck with me and basically I started to retaliate when she got into her bipolar bitchfits where she'd just scream and throw plates, i'd yell back at her to stop and that no one cares about what she says anymore and somehow, she'd always have it turned against me. Sometimes she'd even chase me and threaten to beat me and no one else in the house would try to stop her. I know for a fact that I wasn't in the wrong, everyone behind her back would say how they hated her bitching but when i stood against her no one defended me.   \nI think on the last day of 11th grade I had went over to my boyfriends house and she had not told me to pick up my little brother from school she just expected me too because she didn't want to or something, well when my boyfriend at the time went to sleep I got a text from her saying that she was going to beat my ass and at that point i started to cry and shake and it woke my boyfriend up and he was asking me what was wrong and i just started screaming and it scared him, but for some reason i guess i thought he was going to hit me ? I think that was the reason but i'm not too sure anymore. My boyfriend eventually pinned me into a corner hugging me trying to ask me what was wrong but I just couldn't speak, that was such a traumatizing day i don't know why i broke down like that and i feel bad because i'm sure if i didn't do that he'd probably still be with me today, but I was scared. When I got home my mom had chased me through the house and tried to bust my door down and this was over me not picking up my brother from school, do you guys think that's a good reason to try and beat your own kid? I don't think it is. I was shaken and i don't think I left my room for about 4 days the only person i texted was my boyfriend but even then i'd get so tired from not eating i'd pass out and i don't remember much after that.   \nNowadays i still do live with her because i truly have no one else to go to, no friends i don't even have that boyfriend anymore, She is constantly harrassing me for rent money, I work at a deli and i come home so tired from standing 5-6 hours a day (i know its not a lot but i would nearly pass out if i worked 8-9 hours, 7 was a maybe i could do), I rarely have time to take my paychecks to the bank or pull money out of the bank, my dad and my older brother also pays rent but she just lays around and sells stupid antiques online that she got at auctions, and sometimes she even spends money on casinos, it's really disgusting to be honest.   \nLosing my boyfriend a year ago (because he \"didn't love\" me anymore), and then me having a breakdown over that which made me lose a bunch of friends, mixed with working a shit job that I hate and then coming home and getting bitched at by someone who lays around all day, it's really been making me feel like I should just die and disappear like my existence was only made for some twisted puppeteers amusement. Maybe i'm just overreacting but it really hurts for some reason, everyone just tells me to get over these things but i can't, I never had a mother or any kind of guidance i feel like i raised myself for the most part.

But in e-mail, I can only filter.  And because I cannot erase entirely, once in a while curiosity gets me and I check.  Not compulsively, but more than I'd like.  More than I'd like to admit.  Maybe once every few months.  Sometimes there's something new there, sometimes there isn't.  I don't feel disappointed.  I feel relieved when there is nothing new.  But the feeling is fleeting.  A few months go by without him trying and I start to feel free or that he's given up.  Part of me blames myself, if I wasn't curious and I didn't look at all, none of it would affect me.  I'm not sure why I keep checking.  I don't want him back.  He destroyed me in ways I never thought possible or another human capable of. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut give it more time, and another message inevitably makes its way to me.  I don't open them.  But I can see the little previews.  When I did open them, they were never more than short one liners begging me to respond or to make contact.  If someone really is sorry or really thinks you have all the details wrong, they would have tried to explain themselves along the way.  He never has.  I know it's not real.  Logic dictates it's not real.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's always just been messages saying I'm wrong about it all or that he's waiting for me and it'll always be me.  I know it's lies.  All of it.  Every single word.  Every message is just designed to remind me that he used to have me.  That he's still there.  That all of it really happened and I can't escape any of it even when I try to forget.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo years later, I still get curious.  I feel that I've moved on, but I'm still here, checking every so often.  \n\n\nI met an amazing person who gives me hope in people again, makes me think wading through all the monsters and cruelty was worth it, yet here I am, at some a.m. hour, checking.  I almost want to blow it up because part of me is stuck there thinking I'm still that person with him, still so undeserving and full of flaws and no one could ever value me more than he did.  \n\n\nI'm checking because of all the things I thought I had gotten rid of that were gifts or tokens or reminders, I found a small bookmark he had drawn for me in a poetry book, marking a poem I had sent him when I finally left approximately two years ago.  And so I'm looking because I can't ignore my curiosity and the newest messages are different from the rest.  They're threatening self harm and I know they're not real and it's been so long, why now?  But the part of me that cares and puts everyone before my own self bleeds.  And that's why the tears.  \n\n\nI know it's not real, but I can't help checking.  I'm sure I'll be told not to check, but I don't know how.  I've been in therapy since the time it all ended because I was a very very broken person and I felt like I had come so far, but I can't help being compelled by these messages that I know have to be lies.  It's just desperation.  I know it'd be silly to break no contact now after I've gone so far and done so well.  And over a lie.  But a small part of me is scared it isn't.  I don't want to be responsible.  But the logic part tells me I'm not.  He chose this.  \n\n\nHow do you guys cope with narcs who still reach out years and years later?  It feels like I'm back there every time.  I luckily haven't run into him yet, but we frequent the same areas we used to.  I have no idea how I will react if I saw him again.  I hate that he still controls so much even though he's been gone for so long now.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We met as mutual friends three years prior to our relationship, and had been in relationships at the time. We started off as really good friends, and connected over a deep conversation about people we knew dying of cancer. He helped me when I had relationship problems for my boyfriend. Basically, my ex-boyfriend made me feel unattractive, and tried helping me by telling me what to say and do, what underwear to buy, etc. Like, he was the number one person who was there for me.  \n\n\nAfter it didn't work out, him and I thought we'd try dating. Not only was the sex amazing, but we have had a great mutual relationship. He would leave me notes on my pillow. We would do things for each other like make each other our favorite meals after a long day's work. Our parents love us. It's real love.  \n\n\nI'm In Africa right now, apart from him, and it's gotten me thinking. We have been talking about marriage. Yet, I've noticed some weird things about how he's treated his friends. He has great friends, who support him. But when one of those friends has a problem, it's weird. He will treat them really well, and then ghost him.   \n\n\nFor example, one of his friends got really depressed about being abandoned by his family, and basically shut down. Like, he's on disability now. This was a really good friend of his, and he really valued him. Another good friend of his has health issues and money issues, and came clean about that recently. I know about this person, and they would *never* use this as an excuse to ask for money. Again, he just ghosted them. I asked him about these friends, and his words to me were \"a lot of people care about me, but I don't really care about most people.\"  \n\n\nNow, he is obsessed with me, and I with him. But for the last four days or so, I've just been feeling really uncomfortable, and have been trying to put words to it. We have a dom/sub sexual dynamic that is built out of trust. But I come from a poorer family. He has never lorded this over me, as he is rich, and has respected my position on not accepting gifts. But now I'm feeling uncomfortable like, does he love me just because I am lower than him?  \n\n\nI'm a little shook at seeing friends that he had known for years and built a great report with get ghosted because they suddenly had some weakness. It was like he took pleasure in doing it.  He even makes jokes at their expense. He bad-mouths them. These people are now texting me, asking me what's going on with him.   \n\n\nIt's also really weird, because through all of this, I've gone from being head-over-heels in love with him to almost completely apathetic. I have also been growing attracted to someone I've met in Africa. He's very empathetic and emotionally easy to relate to. I feel very confused right now. It's such a small thing, why is it making such a big deal out of it? Do you think he really has Narcissism", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I found a number for that address in her contacts and angrily called him and told him what I thought of him in no uncertain terms.\n\nThe evidence was overwhelming. Even she could not lie her way out of it this time. She came home from work and grudgingly admitted to me: \"I *have* been having an affair.

I know that this  makes me sound like an old fool but throughout our 'relationship' she had continued to tell me I was her 'soulmate' and the 'love of her life' on a regular basis.

Instead, I threw her out of the house that very same day and she sped off in a taxi to 'stay with her brother'.\n\nExcept she didn't go to her brother's.

She sat next to me in my class. I remember the first time I saw her, having an immediate bad feeling about her. At the same time, I was very curious too. She was around 42 and had a daughter my age who went to the same classes as her. One day I found out that she use to be part of the same church/community that my family had recently joined. I was feeling very lost and it was relieving to find out that someone had been through the exact same experience as myself. That's when I started chatting with her outside class. The first one-on-one conversation I had with her outside campus we talked for like 2 hours. I told her more about myself than I'd ever told anyone. She was very open herself too, and we just got attached to each other very quickly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a year passed by and I would hang out with her and her daughter every day for lunch. I'd go to events with them over the weekend. The Narcissist started saying things like \"you're like a son to me\" and the daughter would be like \"you're like a brother to me\" which always made me really uncomfortable. I was super uncomfortable with the relationship that the mother/daughter had. Her daughter acted like her spouse in terms of how she offered her mom emotional support. There was definitely some emotional incest going on between them. The dad always seemed like a third wheel in the family. I started to notice other red flags, such as, the daughter was not allowed to take college classes by herself. Both her parents went to school, and either the Narcissist or the father would take the same class as her. The narcissist orchestrated it all by picking classes for the whole family. I noticed that the narcissist seemed to have problems/drama with everyone else in the school, but I'd brush it off thinking \"that's just her personality.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring my friendship with the narcissist, I started to go slightly mentally unstable. I would regularly have \"breakdowns\" where I would get emotional outbursts of crying or being super angry. I never knew why I was having these issues, but they always seemed to happen right after I'd go to the Narcissists house. She convinced me that perhaps I was bipolar, like she is, and said that I needed her since she has dealt with the same issues. My depression/highs seemed to match exactly with the cycle of hers - looking back, I was just extremely codependent/empathetic and soaked in all her emotions. I remember when I realized this, and decided to stop falling into her same emotions. One day she was like \"I've been really depressed lately... haven't you been too?\" And I had actually been in a really good mood, so I told her, and she was like \"I think you're just having underlying depression.\" and then she asked her daughter if she agreed, and the daughter agreed, and I realized that they were trying to manipulate me. It's very hard to know what's real/fake when you're around a narcissist, because they enlist people to support their lies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a few month period where I kept hanging out with them while having the intention that the friendship wouldn't last. I just kept telling myself to wait until the end of the school year. I couldn't wait that long though. During winter break, the Narcissist had contacted me and told me that I wasn't allowed to hang out with one of my friends, because she had drama with my friend in the past. That was when I cut ties with the narcissist, and she was very upset and called me a \"sociopath.\" Whenever she has had problems with people in the past, her go-to thing is to call them a liar and a sociopath, just to discredit everything about them. \n\nOn the first day of the Spring semester, I went to my classes. The narcissist had dropped their classes and taken the same ones as me. I didn't find this out until I was sitting in class and she walked in with her daughter. Her daughter had a guilty/worried look on her face. I ignored the Narcissist and this only made things worse. She started stalking me on campus, following me wherever I go and trying to get my attention. I would put in my headphones and look down at my phone while she either walked behind me. She would sit outside my classes that she was not apart of and wait for me to get out. Nobody knew that I had cut ties with her, so the stalking and harassment were very alienating and I didn't know how to get help. I would have nightmares every night about her and going to school. My stress levels were so high. I was afraid that if I told anybody was happening that they wouldn't believe me or think I was crazy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a month of this happening, I finally decided to make a report through my school. It started a domino effect of other people who made their own reports against her; from theft to harassment to bullying. To my surprise, nobody was shocked when I told them about my Narcissist. Everyone in the school had their own problems with her, and although my story was the worst, there were lots of people who had problems with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything was so cloudy coming out of my friendship with the narcissist. There was a part of me that wondered if it was all in my head, or if I was overreacting. I've been continually reminded that I am not alone, and stories are still coming out about the narcissist that I was unaware of. There was a girl who stopped me in the hall at school and told me her own story about the narcissist. She said \"I thought I was the only one and wondered if it was all in my head.\" She started crying and I was very upset too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI learned after everything that the narcissist was never part of the same church/community, and that I was being lied to from the very beginning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sometimes check her social media or take the route home that passes by her house. I don't know why. I guess it makes me feel safe knowing she is still in the same place, doing the same things in life. I think there's also a small part of me that hopes that she is capable of change, and capable of genuinely being the person she only pretended to be, and that there is still a chance that we could still be friends. I know that it will never happen, though. It's just not easy cutting someone off so quickly who was previously part of everything in your life. I know that only time can mentally separate me from her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything has taught me so many valuable lessons. I've done a lot of self reflecting in the past 10 months and realize that although she was a narcissist, I was extremely codependent. We fit each other like a hand and glove. I didn't realize that narcissists search out codependents like a pedophile searches out a child on the playground. It is all very disgusting to me. I guess what makes me different from the narcissist is that I can reflect and grow, and make myself better because of this. The other people who have had problems with her have hated or wished death on her. I don't hate her all, because that would require too much effort and attention that she does not deserve.

He is constantly praising me about it in a way that I find excessive and sometimes unwarranted. \nFor example, he recently told me he has told everyone in his family and also his girlfriend about how awesome I am and how much I have helped him out, when in reality I just gave in a good word for him to our professor. \nHe got in the lab, and the professor emailed us about our schedules for the semester. Everyone save for him replied, and my professor got exasperated and thought that I just dragged him into the lab. I explained to the professor that I didn't drag him, that he told me, repeatedly, about how he wants to do all this research and help out and go to grad school. He has said this repeatedly yet he never answered the professor's emails. \nHe called me recently and he exaplined why: he says he doesn't check his email often, and went ahead and gave me a sob story about how he suffered from depression and mania, and how he has progressed so much thanks to his dad and meditation. He then went ahead and praised me so much. I was just giggling as he was flattering me because it just seems so fake and suspicious. What really made me think this person is likely a narc who will later want to ask something from me is that he began saying how much we have in common, like our humor and way of thinking. He also has said this before, and also how much we connect and how close we are, even though he joined our group in March and I have not met with him extensively. I trained him and all, and we would talk, but that early he was already flattering and basically claiming we are so close. \nHe keeps saying I am welcome to go to his house to play pool or have a bbq. \nAnother thing is that he keeps emphasizing his honesty and his no bs attitude. \nAnother thing I realized is that he actually has no friends. I asked him yesterday and he said that people judge him as a douchebag or some kind of arrogant asshole, but that once people know him they like him. \nI am very suspicious and I am not sure those compliments are genuine. \n\nTL:DR This person is flattering me excessively and/or when it is unwarranted or disproportionately, overemphasizes his honesty and alleged hard working nature when so far he has not shown it in a significant way, all his family and his gf apparently know about how awesome I am, and he says we are very close and we connect so well when I barely know anything about him. \n\nWhat do you all think? Please share. For now I am keeping distance and also a very close eye on him. Also, I am a male too and I have a girlfriend, this relationship with this likely narc is purely platonic.

My BF and his Ex dated for 3 years in college, but broke up September 2016. My Bf and I have bene dating for 7 months and I'm his first girlfriend since that relationship.\n\nSo, my BF and his Ex don't talk, don't hangout, and are out of each others lives for the most part. He's never made me feel like things we're unresolved or that he wasn't 100% over her and committed to me and him. But, even though him and his ex don't talk, she still comes to all of his music shows - and shows up early and is usually one of the last to leave.\n\nNow, I have absolutely no issue if she acted as though she was just an old friend wanting to come support him in his music, or even if she wanted to be my friend of whatnot. But she acts as if she's still apart of the inner circle evereytime she's at a show. She always goes up and talks to his family and close friends as if she knows them super well, although its general knowledge that his entire family dislikes her. She jump-hugged my Bf, while he and I were standing and talking, she handed him drinks while he was on stage, and stays an hour after every show with some of her friends while my BF makes rounds and thanks everyone for coming. \n\nShe's also, extremely magnetic and charming. I admit I used to obsess over her and for a few months she became the root of my insecurities until I talked to my BF about how I was feeling, and he told me she was a narcissist and that most people, aside from two of her friends, find her behavior as jarring and uncomfortable as I do. He even mentioned that she's tried to get help from professionals, but that no matter what, it hasn't really helped.\n\nWhile hearing that was validating and made me feel better, I still wonder how I can help myself not feel threatened in her presence. There really isn't a way to set the boundary to make her not come to his show events, as she's apart of his college friend group, and they are generally public shows, plus, my BF just isn't that kind of guy and I'm alright with that. \n\nShe's never addressed me, even while standing in the same talking circle as me, as if to make a point. Her energy is huge and she talks very loud, and I don't know, some people just have that look in their eye that somethings a but off?  And I know its ridiculous, because technically I have the power in the situation as my Bf's current girlfriend, and his family and friends like me and have all blatantly said they dislike her for the kind of behavior I listed above. But, I'm just such a sensitive person, I can't help but feel threatened and super uncomfortable by her fake-comfortable and charming behavior, even if I know it isn't being well received.\n\nIs there anything I can do to help myself? I get irritated and jealous and feel so small whenever she's around, even though my BF usually stands by me and treats me as normal (which is validating, but for me this is about her and I, not her and him).

She gets extremely upset if she's not included in my creative projects, and seems jealous if my projects get attention. She'll cry, pout, say I'm awful to her because I didn't include whatever contribution she made, ultimately when I concluded it wouldn't work or didn't fit into what I was doing. She has contributed before, but if anything is excluded she gets angry. She has her own projects and I never force myself into them or throw a fit if I'm not included. Seems incredibly selfish and childish to me.\n2. I've broken up with her a dozen times. It never seems to stick. She'll go insane, make threats, cry, create crazy drama, millions of texts, manipulate me, and somehow I get drawn back in every time. It does seem if I do not talk to her and don't say a word to her, it keeps things more cool but it's only so long before she'll create drama.\n3. Even though we are together all day every day, she complains we don't do enough special things. I finally plan to go out with her the other day, and she decides to make a super nasty crack about my ex-friends I had a falling out with, and how she'd end up drinking a beer with them and talking shit about me with them. Super dirty thing to say, and no apology at all. I immediately turn the car around and I haven't said a word to her in two days.\n4. There have been verbal assaults that are extremely nasty in the year I've known her. She has also gone after my exes online, and routinely trashes and attacks people in groups, making a sport of it (she always claims 'they started it first' but it's often her egging it on, looking for a way to assault people. She'll make cracks like, 'I hope you die of cancer' or stuff like, extremely disturbing, lump in your throat stuff. She thinks it's cool, says she'll 'stop' never seems to though.)\n5. She claims we're soulmates and amazingly compatible. I find we are in some ways, but not in many others. She can be very aggressive, loud, trashy. It's been a year of her professing how we're soulmates and how I'm 'ruining' something so special.\n6. She has two people in her life who have committed murder and gotten away with it. An ex bf and a friend. She maintains good relations with them and sees no issue with this. None. It f'ing terrified me that I'm with someone whose two friends are literal murderers. I found this out more recently.\n7. She says, 'You hate the things about me that are also in yourself, that's why you hate me.' I'm sorry I don't have friends who murdered people, nor do I go around trying to troll people and find ways to tell them how they deserve to die.\n\nThe list could go on for another twenty pages. What am I dealing with? The good news is she took it upon herself to ask to get a plane ticket and leave, and she's leaving in a few days, but I'm worried things could escalate. I feel like this person is dangerous. She has NEVER left quietly, on past visits which also escalated into break ups. Always me ending it. This is the first time, on her own, she asked to get the plane ticket and go. But no clarity on her plans. She's just going to live in my house for three days and it will be awkward as hell.

It was primarily gaslighting and crazymaking. \n\nHe isn\u2019t the first narc I\u2019ve walked away from. The first was my ex best friend, and her smear campaign was incredibly obvious. She contacted people in my life who she didn\u2019t even know and told obvious lies about my family and I, to the extent that friends were reaching out to me to let me know (they were concerned). \n\nMy ex, though, didn\u2019t. There were some signs initially (his older brother and sister in law blocked me on social media, his parents stayed friends), but nothing really beyond that. \n\nHis best friend, who is the one who encouraged me to end things (he had acted incredibly selfishly with him as well\u2014 we both saw the mask slip at pretty much the same time) promised to let me know if he tried to smear me, and said that he didn\u2019t mention a thing. My ex had previously smeared me to him. \n\nHis other best friend, who was apparently his confidant in our breakup (my ex\u2019s words), randomly reached out to me recently (over a year later) and has kept in touch, and even remarked on my empathy and tendency to get involved with toxic people. This shocked me perhaps the most, since I would expect the \u201cconfidant\u201d to get the bulk of the smear. \n\nEx\u2019s behavior toward me (before I went NC and post breakup) was unbelievably cruel, full of more gaslighting, and words and actions meant to be hurtful, so it\u2019s not like he wasn\u2019t angry. All of the songs he wrote about me were gaslighting-in-song... so I suppose that may count? Though his writing is so complex I doubt anybody picked up on what he was claiming. \n\nConsidering the amount of venting I\u2019ve done to my close friends and family, the fact that he didn\u2019t smear me makes me feel like I am the narcissist who launched a smear campaign.

I have been so frustrated with him, for months, for years. I've voiced my frustrations over and over with him about his involvement when it comes to everything in the relationship. He's always been a nice guy, and while he never cleans on his own without being told to, and he has awful debt, and a low paying job, I did voice to him that I'm extremely frustrated that as I'm 25 and him 34, I make more than him and paid off my own car all by myself. I'm tired of having to work so hard for him to not bring anything that will progress our future together. I have stuck by his side because he's always treated me well. I've been in a lot of abusive relationships in the past and while he can't do much to provide financially, he has always come through emotionally. In all the years we have been living together, he has only yelled at me a handful of times, and laid his hands on me a few times. He only has ever hit me when I go into hysteria. I used to have terrible anger and breakdown episodes our first year together. I would get so angry I would toss whatever was closest to me. I never did any major damage to anything, but it was always this uncontrollable fit of rage. I often couldn't snap out of these episodes and he would have to slap me or grapple me to get me out of it. I have worked on my anger and anxiety since then and haven't relapsed in years. Until, a few hours ago of course.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry with him because of a lot of pent up disappointment. I've been doing so much to be supportive and giving him chances to do better for himself. I've lent him my own car for work and interviews, put away my own disappointment and encouraging him to do better. I have been trying to get through with him and have him open up, but he's so defensive. I once lent him my car and some guy cut him off and he nearly rammed the guy with my car with me in it. I was so furious with him because I worked so hard to have my car and it is my lifeline. I have no family, no friends, and nothing to fall back onto, I can't possibly afford to have my car wrecked or damaged. I let this all out to him, but as always he kept silent and ignored me. I lost it. I tossed a trash can out of anger and in an instant he lunged at me, the look on his face terrifying. He grabbed my shoulder so hard and grappled me slamming me into the wall. It broke the drywall and a huge hole is left. I have had a back and shoulder injury from a past job last year and I think it brought it back. He swears he didn't mean to and he fell onto me...but..I don't know. He says he loves me and didn't want to hurt me, he cried and asked if I was okay. I can't afford a doctor I don't have insurance and the pain is setting in. I slept it off and he cried to me saying how sorry he was and went to clean house as I stayed away in  our bedroom.  \n\n\nIn the past he's done similar things. I know he has a temper and I do too. I told him we can try to set money aside for counseling. But, I don't know if this is something that can be fixed, and it doesn't feel worth pursuing anymore. I don't feel safe. He really hurt me, I know he is sorry...but I can't shake the feeling that this isn't right. I don't trust him anymore.  \n\n\nI don't know what to do.

We had been to marriage counseling once before; we stopped going because he left that time too. This time, the marriage counselor we saw wouldn't take us -- she said that he'd made up his mind everything was my fault and could see nothing good in me or our relationship of over 20 years. I'd been suffering from depression from the on again off again nature of our relationship over the past five years; it was literally driving me crazy. When I started to recover, he started to blame my depression for the decline in our marriage, suggesting he'd be willing to recommit after I got mentally healthy again. Oh boy. My therapist was the one who suggested he might be a narcissist and after falling into that rabbit hole, I think she was right -- he's got all the signs of a covert narcissist. I hate that I know what this means now.\n\nWhen he left three months ago, I stopped contacting him, mostly. He sent a gift for me to my mom's house, 300 miles away, I guess he wanted her to see it? I sent him a one line \"thank you for the gift.\" It would have been thoughtful at another time, but I felt manipulated. He complained to my bestie that he had to get news of my mom's health via my brother; I sent him a three line update after she had surgery. I changed all the passwords on the bank accounts, disconnected the joint accounts, unfriended him on FB. He continued to contact my best friend for news of me, I finally told my friend to stop talking to me about him unless it was an emergency. I blocked him on Instagram after he liked a bunch of photos I took when I went to the beach with the dog -- he doesn't get to be a tourist in my life and I don't want to see him responding to anything I do. He emailed me about a banking issue which I agreed to attend to, but in the future, I will not do anything for 48 hours because he ended up solving the problem himself and it just stressed me out. I guess that's four minor interactions in three months? Four too many, but I'm learning. I'm getting a lawyer and trying to find out what my rights are given that he basically abandoned me.\n\nMy depression is so much better now that he's gone -- it's in remission, is that the right thing to say? -- but I am terrified of this coming winter. The realization that I've been completely played makes me feel like a idiot and when the sadness of loss sneaks up on me, I get freaked out that it's my depression returning, even though it's \\*totally\\* normal to feel sad when you're going through ... this. Sometimes it's still so shocking, that he just walked out on me, that he just said, \"Nah, I don't want to, I'm out,\" when it came to his having to face up to his role in our situation. I keep wanting things to make sense and they won't, ever, I know that in my head but the other gooey parts of me want some kind of key. I have to learn to accept, \"Honey, he's a narcissist,\" as the answer to that nagging question. A friend makes this joke: I've done nothing and nothing is working! That is \\*so\\* my not yet ex-husband.\n\nI guess I'm doing okay, but I just got home from vacation and walking into the empty house was a real downer. The realization moments are so hard. And learning what happened is hard.

I've been through a few cycles of grief (feels a lot like when my first spouse passed away). At the start the waves came every few days, just feeling weepy and intense sorrow, like the kind that feels like your whole chest feels heavy, then days of exhilaration of not having to walk  on egg shells, to be able to do whatever I want, feeling the huge weight of carrying this emotional vampire (in every possible way) off my shoulders. \n\nSince then I've had so many logistical things to take care of, keep things going with work, keep a strong front for the kids, the waves have come less frequent but not necessarily less intense.  I'm pretty much feeling like a hot mess at the moment. Similar to grieving, its like the whole world is not stopping because you lost someone and in this case, was emotionally abused. No one really knows because they can't see the scars and bruises. Some days it just feels too hard but yet there is no time to just fall apart. \n\nPart of the grief, for me is also just feeling alone. My narc, like probably a lot of yours worked hard at running off any support structure you may have had, friends, family, etc, which just makes recovery that much harder. I worked my N-ex like a job, needing so much of me all the time that my friends and family felt alienated bc I didn't stay in contact. I've made an effort to reach out to a few friends but relationships don't form back over night plus I relocated so I don't have anyone close by. At this point I really only have my counselor that I can speak to about this. I am going to be part of a NA Recovery group that my counselor is putting together (3rd client this year alone going through it). I have joined joined a few meetup groups but haven't actually been to an outing yet. It all takes time and I'm just trying to give myself a break and just keep swimming.  \n\nAlso, making recovery a bit harder has been fighting off the hoover attempts, which with my Nex started right off the bat. When I started to cry uncle (while we were still together) he sought counseling, explained the abuse as his own grief of losing his best childhood friend (in reality he lost his main supply which is why things fell apart with us). It became clear in counseling that it wasn't going to be enough (he would do the minimum to not get fired, or only would correct his behavior when I brought it up, never able to come up with it on his own), I planned ahead and swiftly cut things off and kicked him out and he didn't know what hit him. He immediately turned to Jesus. Besides our previous couples counselor, he recruited a few more flying monkeys in the process, they just can't understand how I could walk away now that he has come to know the Lord and now has a job. Me knowing less is more, just keep my thoughts to myself and let them think what they want. MIL (covert narc) accused me of being Bipolar, of course. The in-laws, not seeing  any signs of physical abuse, judge me and hate me for not letting him back. Some how I am the asshole and having to bite my tongue just infuriates me but I know that's the only way to feed the narc, keep the emotional responses going. Having to stay steadfast and not defend myself is hard but I know it's what needs to be done.  \n\nAt first I was questioning if a Narc could really turn things around, but soon it became clear its just the next iteration of the abuse. Within weeks telling me that I must see how much he has changed, how things will be amazing now. Sending me flowers and making a big deal for my birthday when he never had before (love bombing). Pulling the \"sacred vows\" card and pointing out how I was walking away from my duty as his spouse (manipulation).  Asking things like \"how did I get over him\" or accusing me of not being as committed to him since I am unwilling to try again (more manipulation). Crossing my boundary of not discussing anything beyond finances or our child and excusing himself by saying i have been unclear (gas lighting), I have been perfectly clear repeatedly and in writing.  Once all this crystalized for me, I became more diligent in not allowing any contact beyond logistical matters. I realized entertaining this possibility put me right back into the middle of the abuse cycle and I had to practically start my recovery over. \n\nHaving gone through this I feel like I have aged so much, that I am not the person I once was, full of optimism and hope and I realized how much pressure I was putting on myself to be better, like RIGHT NOW. I realized that maybe it's ok for now to be a mess, to feel like shit, to not reach this unreasonable ideal of where I should be right now and just accept that I feel broken, hurt, scared, alone, overwhelmed.  I really need to let this all out. Thanks.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

At that point I didn\u2019t even care anymore if I was the \u201esecond girl\u201c if it meant I could be with him but he again lied to her it all came out and she ended it completely. \n\nBut a few days ago I surprisingly met him at a friend\u2018s party and at first my friends always pushed me away from him so that i wouldn\u2019t talk or even look at him or be near him but then he came to me and wanted to talk and so we did and he told me basically everything I wanted to hear and then I went with him to another party at a club. And later on of course i went with him to his place and we had amazing sex. \n\nBut I was kinda distant turned around after we had sex because I realized that what I just did was just going to hurt me more but he wanted to cuddle and he held me the whole night and even asked me if I could lay my head on his chest and was constantly giving me kisses everywhere - and he rarely did so while we were together and we talked and laughed and had more sex that night/day. He later told me to text him and of course I did but he ignored me and now I\u2019m trying to get us back together and fighting for it. He tells me he doesn\u2019t want it anymore, that it would not do any good etc but I have the feeling that me fighting for him is what he wants and that at some point he will say ok let\u2019s try it again.\n\nAnd also what i don\u2019t understand is that he said I shouldn\u2019t tell his ex that we spent the night together because they are texting again but he told me that he doesn\u2019t want her and she doesn\u2019t want him and that they don\u2019t text abl\u00f6st just sometimes but it kinda bothers me. But then again the past few weeks where he has been with her and told me everything will turn out fine he never met me and was more distant and wouldn\u2019t risk it so I don\u2019t think he would now. \n\nI just don\u2019t get why I do that. I know it\u2019s bad for me and will just hurt me more and more. I know he did horrible things and didn\u2019t care if they would hurt me. But any time he wants to end it I hold onto it for dear life and literally can\u2019t do anything else or let him go. It doesn\u2019t matter if it just destroys me more as long as I am with him. And I also know that he is a narcissist and will never change and doesn\u2019t really love me and I also know why I hold onto him so much and what issues I have that lead me to that. I know about everything and yet i still can\u2019t let him go and instead I fight for him and us any time it seems to crumble. It\u2019s just like I can\u2019t stop it because I don\u2019t know what else to do and the pain of being without him seems so much more unbearable than the pain being with him even though I also know that with him it is a constant state of pain and anxiety and without him just temporary.

I don't know if he was a narcissist or had BPD but something just doesn't sound right. We were together for almost 2 years and it was pretty chaotic from the start.

He had told me he liked drama but seriously how much drama does a person need? \n\nA little over a month ago, he started to criticize me again and I had had enough. I told him he needs to figure this part of himself out or let me go. He chose the latter. I reached out over and over again and he was so cold and mean. Fast forward, it turns out he was cheating because I have an STI. Somehow his result turned up negative. And it doesn't matter if you believe me or not, I have not cheated on him. I don't understand how we have different results. \n\nWe went from being so in love, discussing marriage to me being completely shut out and ignored. He has zero care in the world for my feelings. He never did whenever I brought them up. He always gave me the silent treatment. He knows how much I love him and it's so obvious based on how many times I've reached out to him but I get nothing in return. And now I'm blocked although I have done nothing wrong! From what I have read, I understand the narcissist love attention and I keep giving it to him. \n\nIs it typical for narcissist to create unnecessary chaos and go to extremes for literally no reason?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My hair was frizzy, I was klutzy\u2014but it was endearing in the beginning, it was cute and amusing. I laughed with him, I agreed. Then over time they started to build, everything was all on my time, I was horrible at making plans. I talked too loud, I always was just too loud, I didn\u2019t have experience living in an apartment (What the ACTUAL fuck\u2014I had lived alone and in separate apartment buildings in NYC before) so I didn\u2019t know how to keep my voice down, I was too loud during sex, I was too soft during sex, other girls liked it more rough and maybe I was really just that sensitive (Always brought up previous sexual partners. Included details that I didn\u2019t need to know. Made sure I knew that he was actually great at sex and other girls approved). We didn\u2019t have good sexual chemistry. That was everything to him, and he just wasn\u2019t getting it with me. Really rough sex is how he shows his love, and it killed him that I couldn\u2019t take it (Funny, since him I\u2019ve built up a tolerance and like sex more rough. EVERYONE is too soft now. So thanks for that). He withheld sex and affection. We\u2019d go a month without sleeping together. He would barely touch me and never fooled around when I was on my period. Periods are gross. Women are gross. He was addicted to porn. Watched it all of the time. He picked porn over me. He would lock himself away for hours and watch porn and play video games. I was the bitch because I\u2019d knock on his closed door and just want to see him before I went off to work. We had opposite schedules. I was too clingy. I was up his ass too much on the weekends. I needed to back off. We lived together, I was covering his rent, he was working barely two nights a week, but I was just too much. He\u2019d get jealous if I dressed up to go out with friends and he wasn\u2019t going\u2014he said I never dressed up for him. I would literally be wearing the exact same outfit that I wore on a date with him and he still would be pissed. He was more of an ass guy than a boob guy; he would remind me all of the time, trying to make it into a funny joke, because we both knew that I barely have an ass and I\u2019m almost a DD. He knew of my attraction to girls and always tried to convince me to have a threesome. I\u2019m honestly kind of open to a threesome but the thought of one with him I could never fully picture. I felt so insecure when it came to that kind of stuff with him, something just always felt off and wrong. He pushed my boundaries in the bedroom. I was too high to know what was going on one time and completely drunk another. I don\u2019t know if he ever raped me, but he definitely sexually manipulated me. He said I asked too many \u201cYes/No\u201d questions. It made me feel super hyper aware and incredibly insecure and I even asked my manager at work if I asked too many of those kinds of questions\u2014and felt like crying when I realized that that was one right there. He made me doubt myself. One day in our driveway he turned to me and asked, \u201cAre you ok? What\u2019s going on with you?\u201d And he said it in such a serious way that it caught me off guard. I was actually having a really good day. He made me question myself. Maybe I was too spacey. Maybe something really was wrong with me. Maybe I was actually crazy.... He said I was the abusive one, I was the tyrant. Our relationship was toxic. It\u2019s both of our faults, then it\u2019s just mine. I have no personality, I\u2019m no fun. I can\u2019t take a joke. I\u2019m not funny or playful. I\u2019m not adventurous. I do nothing with my life. I gotta stop that close tie with my family, it\u2019s weird at my age. My biggest problem in life is a dying dog, I need to grow up. I need to move on because we just broke up a few days ago but he wants to start seeing other people. We\u2019re still living together and the bed is mine, he\u2019ll take the couch, but wait a minute actually he just changed his mind. I have the bed one night and he comes in and asks if he can just sleep there cause his back is killing him. I say yes but don\u2019t touch me. We end up having sex. We have sex again the next night. I see his phone the following morning and all of the girls he texted either didn\u2019t answer him or couldn\u2019t hang, so he decided to fuck me instead. He owed me over $1000. I\u2019m still living with him because I don\u2019t have a car and need to go to work and oh yeah, I want my money back. His car that I helped pay for I can\u2019t drive because it\u2019s a stick and he promised he\u2019d teach me but he never did. I feel sick to my stomach every day. I\u2019ve totally lost my appetite. Every time I try to eat I think of her face on his computer screen. I think of all of the lies. I think of him jerking off to her. I lose weight in weeks. I can\u2019t stop crying in the bathroom. We have a fight and he calls me a cunt and pretends to video tape me. I want to actually die. I think, no way will I ever get past this. Just when will I start feeling better again. He says there are bigger things in life. There are more important things. Sure, he\u2019ll miss the good times we had but we both need to learn to move on. This coming from a guy that promised me the world. This coming from a guy that said he wanted to be with me forever. This coming from a guy that said he didn\u2019t think our love would ever grow old.

They care about others, have a strong moral code and will do \"the right thing\". They are sincere, transparent, and have great integrity. \n\nIn short, targets are about love. They operate from a place of love, generosity, and morality. Narcissists, on the other hand, operate from a place of power, greed, and control. They want everything for themselves and for the whole world to revolve around them, regardless of what that does to other people. So, the perfect person for a controller is someone who is emotionally generous and expressive. If you were about power, control, and personal gain, you wouldn't show your emotions and you certainly wouldn't relate to other people authentically, because (a) you'd be too afraid of being taken advantage of by another manipulator, and (b) that approach wouldn't further any of your aims. \n\nSo, you have people who operate from love, connection, and truth, and people who operate from fear, separation, and deception. And these two modes of operation are *light years apart*. \n\nNarcissists, being the control-obsessed predators that they are, are looking to take away your freedom. You express yourself freely, you love. They watch you, they observe you. And they figure out how to control, dominate, and destroy you based on the emotions and the \"self\" that you express. They see every single thing about you as something that they can manipulate and use for their own benefit. So you, just wanting to live your life naturally and be happy, are actually unknowingly participating in your own destruction, because you're showing the narcissist where and how to hurt you.

Often the effects are so subtle that the person may not even be aware of how they are being debilitated.  \n\nI am conducting this research to understand the general problems and blockages faced by adult survivors of CSA so that it can contribute towards generating intervention and counseling steps/methods/practice ideas to help the survivors. \n\nI understand that this is a sensitive matter but the participants' confidentiality is fully maintained in this survey.

My baby daddy and I were never together, just casually hooking up and I got pregnant. I knew he had a drinking problem but I didn\u2019t know how messed up and pretty much abusive he was until I got pregnant by him. I realized recently he is probably a narcissist although I can\u2019t say for certain since he\u2019s never had a diagnosis. But his behavior lines up with it. For almost my entire pregnancy he was hot &amp; cold, sometimes he seemed excited and talked about teaching our son to play sports when he got older and talked about how he wanted to come see him when he was born,we talked about names and he would talk to me about random stuff too. Other times he would be extremely cruel, told me I\u2019d never amount to anything as a single mother, that he didn\u2019t care about me and he threatened to take me to court to get full custody of our son if I made things \u201ctoo difficult\u201d for him. It was an emotional roller coaster and I was so stressed and scared and genuinely confused and wondered what was real about him and what wasn\u2019t during my pregnancy. He also didn\u2019t want to tell his parents until he had a \u201cdna test in his hand\u201d saying he was the dad (he is..) because they\u2019d \u201cdisown him.\u201d Apparently he and his parents have a very complicated and probably f*cked up relationship which would explain why he is the way that he is. I ended up telling his mother and he cut all contact with me and told me as far as he was concerned our son is not his and if I ever took him to court he would basically say that I raped him bc he was drunk the night we had sex and our son was conceived, therefore he \u201ccouldn\u2019t consent\u201d. I was so blown away I just figured he was completely insane and I didn\u2019t want to have to deal with him trying to retaliate if I took him to court. Then a few months ago he starts adding me on Snapchat from different accounts and deleting the requests. I know him and i knew it was his childish way of trying to suck me back into whatever this game is that he plays. His mom seemed interested in meeting her grandson but she decided to believe his lies that I refuse to get a dna test (I never refused) and never bothered to try to meet my son or make things right. \nAnyway, now it\u2019s over a year later, my son is a year old now. Money is becoming more and more of an issue. My parents help me out and I have a part time job and am finishing up school so I can get a better job to support me and my son. But it is not easy. I\u2019ve thought about going to court to get child support, my mom has asked me to but also said I don\u2019t have to bc she doesn\u2019t want to be blamed if my bd goes full psycho. I have no idea if he would or if he would just be a coward about it, and maybe quit his job to get out of paying. I just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s even worth it. I need the money. I\u2019m going to have to put my son in daycare eventually and then school and I need the help. I don\u2019t know what to do.

Why can't I shout out loud that I was abused, that I was lied to throughout my entire relationship, that I was lured into signing a deal with a set of terms that weren't clearly disclosed to me -- that I was emotionally blackmailed, groomed and manipulated, and probably cheated on?

He told me that was the last time im ever going there alone without him (i let him guilt me into agreeing). Hes been hot and cold alot of the relationship. When i mentioned abuse, he said he wasnt cuz he doesnt hit me or scream. I was concerned about our daily bickering but because its my first Serious relationship, he said i dont know whats normal and our bickering is 100% normal and its not aruging. I felt on egg shells for a good portion of our relationship, i had \"no reason to be\". He doesnt apologize really ever. I think hes gaslighted me alot. Idek. Ive spent alot of time staying quiet on things in fear of making him mad. He doesnt scream at me or call me names, but he gets angry and finds alot of things i say as a personal attack. He can be talking to be about something and i can tell him oh well i read this or that or this is what i know. Im then \"assuming shit\", always have to be right and am telling him hes wrong. Our breaking point was he spent 9/10 times rejecting me on sex after i got back from seeing my family. Barely showing me affection or love. Not putting effort to communicate with me. Felt like i was annoying him even standing in the same room. He wasnt helping clean (tho he swears he cleans tho he doesnt) or cook and expected me to do all of it. I did when i wasnt working, no issue. But now that i am + full time school, i need to still do it all and he expects it. Ex: Wont tell me laundry needs to be done, i should know. Gets mad if its not done. He was super supportive of schooling. But now that i am, anytime i struggle its \"well you chose to go.\" \nI had a convo with him about helping with me with household chores, supporting me, showing me love, pretty much everything i felt. Got pissed i asked him to help cook and said its a womans job and hes never had to or learned to. Offer to teach him, be a datenight. Nope its a chore to him. Eventually of all that, ended when he told me \"not to compare you but my exwife did it (cook). And for 2 kids\". And i got pissed. Told him he was purposely trying to hurt me, be cruel. Of course \"i need to go attend english class cuz he said he wasnt comparing me\". And he didnt hurt me and im assuming shit again. He still refuses to apologize about the exwife comment. Also, learned he withheld he has a 2nd marriage that was annulled from me. I told him yesterday if things dont change pernamently, im leaving. He kept trying to joke around despite it being a serious convo, said i dont know how to take a joke. And that he must be doing everything wrong which i said he wasnt but i wont be a housewife ever. Tho he downplays my job because i make much less than him and his is a more trained high top job while mine is just management at a fast food place, and he works longer shifts than me. Tho some weeks, i work more total hours than him (his reasoning for not doing household work is he does long shifts. Tho i can work 3 to 6 days a week, shorter shifts but more total hours sometimes and him anywheres from 2 to 4 days a week, long shifts, sometimes more or less hrs than me).\n\nBut now..since our arugement, hes been suddenly super nice. Did dishes. Acting loving and sweet. Actually wanting to try and have sex for the first time in over a month (i stopped even trying after being rejected so much). Said it was because he took what i said into \"consideration\". \nIts so confusing. I dont wanna let myself hope on this niceness. But what if he is trying to change? Especially since i threatened leaving? What if everything that happened was just a rough patch? Hes been super stressed about bills and having been the only worker for awhile (he didnt want me to work but changed his mind when i was visiting family so i started a job a month ago). Its like i go from fully knowing yup this is awful, toxic when hes cold to me. But second hes nice, i can barely remember why i was mad. I have to keep diary entries just to remember what's happened lately..makes it super hard to make any kind of decisions. \nAnd its like well he doesnt scream, call me names or hit me, so he cant be abusive (tho i know thats not necessarily true). But i had mutiple people say before he may have narcissistic traits or BPD. wanted some more opinions possibly.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Not expecting anyone to read this but if you do. THANK YOU. \n\nMy background: dated a narc for 3 years, thought she was my soulmate. She cheated and destroyed me. The cognitive dissonance and manipulative abuse was borderline lethal. Since then I\u2019ve struggled to trust new partners. Wrestled with depression/suicide. Resulting in 4 years of being single. I\u2019ve just started to date again. \n\nSo\n\nJust started seeing this person. We had a great first date that ended with sex. There might\u2019ve been slight lovebombing, with her saying things like \u201cYou\u2019re the jackpot\u201d or \u201cfinally, a guy who can talk about feelings\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re special\u201d \n\nShe seems really into me. We went on a few more dates, all with intensely great sex. Everything seemed great. She then confronted me about where I thought things were headed and I said I was unsure. It\u2019s hard for me to separate my trust issues from weighing compatibility so I tend to be murky for a while as I build trust. I set a boundary of no exclusivity and a need to keep things slow and casual until I could better understand myself without leading her on. She agreed.\n\nAfter a few more dates I felt the need to re-assert that boundary after she appeared to be attaching in a way that made me uncomfortable. I did this via a long text in the middle of the workday. I suggested my feelings were potentially due to incompatibility, but wasn\u2019t sure. I told her, despite this, I\u2019d like to keep seeing her. \n\nHer reaction went from understanding to accusatory. Saying that I was just trying to \u201cit\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u201d her and that doing it via text in the middle of the workday was extremely unacceptable. Fair point. She seemed super into me, and getting that sort of text probably stung and made it hard to focus on her work. However, I couldn\u2019t help but feel like it was a bit of an overreaction on her part. She asked for me to be honest with her, and I was simply reestablishing what I had already told her. \n\nSo after the text, she came over. She was visibly upset and said she was pretty fricken done with me. Which again, felt odd. We then had a heart to heart about where I was coming from. I told her everything I was feeling and why. I didn\u2019t hold back and exercised some real vulnerability. It felt great. I opened up for the first time in years. She went from wanting to jump ship to being cautiously optimistic. \n\nShe then goes on a trip for a week and a half. During this time, I did some soul searching and felt like I could trust her and wanted to pursue something a little more serious. Our heart to heart made me like her a lot more and I was excited to be vulnerable with someone. I start texting her a little more frequently than I normally would and can\u2019t help but notice that she\u2019s much less engaged in our chats than usual. I get mostly one word answers and general feeling of disinterest. I took this to be her needing space after me pumping the brakes on her.\n\nWe arrange to meet up after she gets back. I go over to her place for dinner and chats. My goal was to get a read on how she was feeling in order to see if it would be appropriate to push things forward. This is when weird shit starts to happen, \n\nWe sit down to eat, she seems detached and cold. I ask about her trip. She said it was amazing and then immediately brings up the fact that she went on a date the last night she was there. Fair enough. I gave her every reason to keep her options open. I ask her how it went. She said it went GREAT. Like SUPER GREAT. She talks about it in longing tones. \n\nI get a little jealous, but who\u2019s fault is that? Mine. \n\nBy this point it\u2019s clear that I\u2019m there because I\u2019m interested in becoming something more than casual. She senses that and points out that we may have swapped roles. Me being the attachy one and her being unsure about things. Which again, fair enough. \n\nShe then starts to talk about this guy friend who she hangs out with from time to time. Said he was in love with her but she might need to cut things off with him because she doesn\u2019t feel the same...and that he was starting to get angry/jealous about her involvement with me. She mentions that he kissed her before she left for her trip. At this point, I\u2019m sort of confused as to why I need to hear about this. I don\u2019t want to be the reason a friendship ends, and it felt like triangulation and ultimately saying \u201cI have options, people want me\u201d\n\nlater on we start making out. Things are inching closer to sex and I stop everything to ask if she had any sex during her trip. This was purely so I could protect myself from STDs. She said she did.\n\nHearing that stung like hell. I said as much to her, but made it clear that I have no one to blame but myself for the jealousy I was feeling. She gives me a sad look and immediately hugs me. Saying she was just following my lead and wouldn\u2019t have done it if she knew about my current feelings. I try not to think about it and move on. That fails, and the rest of the night my mind is racing in and out of jealousy and curiosity about how freely she sleeps with people. On one hand I was cool with it. Sex is fun, why not? But on the other, I was wondering if she was reckless. She didn\u2019t seem interested in telling me she slept with him unless I asked, and I wonder if she would\u2019ve let me fuck her without at least warning me about the risk. Also I remember that our first fuck was unprotected and I had to be the one to stop things and ask if she had been tested since her last partner. She said she had been, but at this point I\u2019m not so sure. \n\nSo we fuck anyway...but I\u2019m noticeably distracted. Meanwhile she\u2019s tossing out compliments like I\u2019m some kind of sex god. I keep thinking about the other guy. I tell her this. She then says \u201cyou have nothing to be worried about, we didn\u2019t even do vag most of the time\u201d I assume this a bone headed way of warding off my fears of disease. \n\n\nBut REALLY? I told her it stung, and that it was affecting my ability to have sex....and her response is to go into the details of what she did with him as if that will somehow put me at ease? She eventually caught herself and said \u201cyou probably don\u2019t want to hear about this\u201d but at that point I was already off a mental cliff. This triggered past trauma when my Nex cheated on me. The only way to make myself feel better was to keep having sex with her and reclaim some sense of adequacy and validation. I felt so unbelievably shitty. \n\nI confronted her about this later, and her apology was this:\n\n\u201dI absolutely shouldn\u2019t have spoken so freely. You\u2019re right. \n\nIm VERY candid and I\u2019m used to my previous partner who had zero ego and couldn\u2019t be offended by anything. All I can say is I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t make me feel better. I didn\u2019t feel like my feelings were seen. I just felt stealth judged about my ego. Although I guess she did technically say sorry. \n\nNow I\u2019m on vacation, but before I left we decided to be exclusive. We both disabled our OKC accounts. I left on a good note. \n\nBut now we\u2019re back to spotty texts. I confronted her about a few more things she said that night and have been waiting for a reply for two days. My gut is SCREAMING at me that something isn\u2019t right. I just can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m being insecure or if she is actually showing signs of being a narc. \n\nThoughts?\n\n\nEdit** added some details to fill out the context of things.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I don't want to be this way any more.\n\nOur relationship is difficult for a few reasons. Especially the last 6 months or so. I've felt like I'm not getting anything from her, and that she doesn't stand up for herself, or for us. And I was resentful about all of that, but that was her just checking out. She has never been able to communicate easily, and she finds it very hard to stand up for herself. Early in our relationship I was sensitive to that fact, but after we built up some resentment, I wasn't. And I dismissed and minimized her opinion every time she did try.\n\nI feel like I may have lost her. She's pretty checked out. And before last week there was no communication about any of this really (there was probably some months ago, but I couldn't hear it). Part of the problem with emotional abuse is the manipulation, and gaslighting, and distortion. And I feel like I've had this moment...I don't want to be this way any more. I just don't know how to show her any of that without it sounding like more emotional abuse and distortion, or if it's even going to matter. \n\nI want to be better, and I don't know what she needs from me right now.

I will get to that later after two examples...\n\nI've read quite often that one should duck away when someone else is manipulative and my therapist once gave me the same advice. However I have discovered that I feel guilty quite easily and that others use guilt trips on me frequently. After I discovered that I got so angry that everytime I sense a guilt trip, I will tell the person and ask for them to stop. My therapist seemed to be fine with me speaking up and setting boundaries, too.\n\nAs an example, a new \"friend\" of mine turned me into the butt of the joke or would make fun of me so much that it dragged me down. So I told him once, twice and more to stop doing it. Then he would criticize my personality: \"you're not fun. I am the funny one and you should deal with my behavior.\" At first he got me and I felt guilty for not being \"fun\" but then I thought \"wait a minute, I can be funny too. I think he is bullying me and it's simply not funny anymore.\" So I told him one last time to change his behavior and haven't heard from him since... and frankly I don't even mind. It got on my nerves that I would have to stand my ground so frequently, that I somehow developed an \"attitude\". \n\nNow I am secretly thinking that he would seriously have to win me over if he wants to come back into my life. That's so new to me since I would usually be open and accept everyone (back) into my life no matter what they have done. The idea that I seem to develop a standard for who is welcome kind off freaks me out since I am scared that I will end up being too picky because... \n\nI once had an encounter with a friend of mine who I did wrong but I noticed it and excused myself for being overly critical with him. Yet, the only thing he answered was \"I wonder if the relationship with someone who is so critical with me is worth it.\" Wow. I was blown away by his answer since it was the first time I questioned his motives and excused myself for being too critical, without him having to ask for it. Aka I made a mistake once and now I wasn't worth the friendship anymore. I've never had someone treat me with a \"the relationship isn't worth it anymore\" statement.

After the first 3 months she was already physically, verbally, and sexually abusive. I would get told repeatedly that I would never find anything better because I wasn't worth it. Because \"all women are like her\". \n\nShe pressured me to move out of my parents house so we stayed with her mom instead. She would yell at me constantly. Saying I needed to get us an apartment in an expensive area. I was only making 10/hr and she wasn't working. The abuse only got worse because I couldn't provide what she wanted.\n\nShe cheated on me, and when she confessed about it she yelled at me for not forgiving her. She would force me to have sex with her. I would get yelled at and hit until I complied. I tried leaving once. I went to stay with a long time friend.

I couldn't leave, I didn't know what to do. I truly felt I wasn't good enough to find someone that genuinely cared for me.\n\nThe second pregnancy was successful. We had to move back with my parents. I begged her to get rid of it. I told her and told her I wasn't ready. She would never listen. Once the baby was born she would go to her mother's house constantly.

Not even a year later she is married to one of my friends.\n\nShe recently blocked me on all social media. My relief was short-lived. She can take me to court. Make me pay for a child I never wanted. Make me pay for her to sit around jobless while she has someone else to support her.\n\nNo one takes me seriously. I'm a \"big guy\" I could have said no, could have left. I just \"need to step up and be responsible for my child and stop making excuses because I didn't want to use protection\". Any advice I've looked for on other subreddits is met with the same thing. That I just don't want to take responsibility. That's not the case. It's just not fair, and no one believes me. \n\nI met a wonderful girl. We're engaged. She's even told me the court will most likely hold me responsible. She supports whatever decision I decide to make but I know she's right. I'll have to go to court or else back child support will build up or I could go to jail if I just ignore it. I can't ignore it and hope for the best because I know my ex. She will come after me when she realizes her new husband won't put up with her or they start struggling for money. She refuses to work. She doesn't even have her diploma. \n\nI'll have to live with her over my shoulder for the next 18 years. I already know the court won't be in my favor.\n\nIt's not as simple as signing my rights over. Even if I do I will still be made to pay child support. I know life isn't fair but damn I feel like I was screwed over.\n\nShe won't even admit what she did. I can't even get an apology or even acknowledgment of the fact that she DID abuse me. I don't even have proof. Every time I would try and record her outbursts I would immediately feel guilty. It was always my fault she would yell. I never did anything right.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

This vacancy was created when I came forward to the brotherhood about how I was sexually assaulted by our president.\n\nGrowing up I had a younger sister, but like many boys I always wanted a brother. Through sports (I have always been a passionate, if not skilled athlete) I came to see my teammates as brothers \u2013 those people that no matter what, you know you can depend on them. They drive you crazy sometimes, but you know they would never cause you harm, and would protect you from those who would seek to harm you. \n\nWith my graduation from high school I no longer had the opportunity to play organized sports, and I worried this would create a void in my life. Upon getting to college I knew one of the first things I wanted to do was join a club, an on-campus group, anything that would give me that same powerful sense of connection that I felt on my teams.\n\nThat being said, I was always ambivalent on joining Greek life. I heard all the stories everybody has heard \u2013 wild parties, drug abuse, and all other forms of debauchery. The idea I had in my head wasn\u2019t too far from Animal House, but I wanted to keep an open mind. When the first group of friends I made in my dorm said they were going out to a rush event I had my doubts, but ultimately decided to go.\n\nFrom the first night I went to recruitment, I knew that this fraternity was where I was meant to be. While other fraternities gave me the impression that their pitch would include nothing but booze, these guys clearly had their act together. They had the highest GPA on campus and went above and beyond in their philanthropy and community service efforts. Above all else, I could tell the men in the house cared about each other \u2013 they had those bonds I recognized from my sports teams, and I wanted so badly to share in those bonds.\n\nWhen recruitment ended and the fraternity informed me that I received a bid, I was ecstatic. All my friends who had rushed with me also got bids, and we decided to jump head-first into the process together. When we were initiated and formally inducted as brothers of the fraternity, I cried of happiness for the first time in my life.\n\nThe following semester went smooth \u2013 while I missed a few more 8am classes than I would have liked, I felt I was adjusting to life in the fraternity well. We had a great group of guys, and if you started to slack off too much academically the older brothers would be sure to set you straight. By the time our end-of-semester date night rolled around, I could not have felt more comfortable about my place in the fraternity or at college.\n\nThe majority of the night went great \u2013 music was bumping, drinks were flowing, not too different from any other college party. As we started creeping past midnight and into the early morning, I became more reckless with my drinking. As the house began to empty, I felt myself getting dizzy. I saw our president was still out in the party room, so I approached him for help. He quickly guided me to the brotherhood room and got me set up on a couch with a trash can, in case I had to vomit.\n\nIt started very typical \u2013 when your friend is sick, you may rub his shoulders, pat his back, anything that you think will make him feel better. That was how it started. Soon, his hands moved from my back to my chest. I thought this was odd \u2013 but figured he was just trying to make me feel better. As his hands moved further down, I was already in denial. \u201cThere\u2019s no way he\u2019s doing this. There\u2019s no way this is happening.\u201d \n\nThe moment he touched me was the most sobering experience of my life. I immediately tried to spring up, but he was significantly bigger than me so I didn\u2019t get very far. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked. I said nothing. He was pressing me down, and I felt an emptiness in my stomach as I thought of what could be next. I felt him relax for a second, and I took this second chance to get away. I was able to get out of the room, and run upstairs to one of the brothers\u2019 rooms. I told him what happened \u2013 I couldn\u2019t tell you what he said in response, but just as quickly as I entered his room I left. I decided I needed to go back to my dorm.\n\nAs I left through the main door, I heard it open again behind me. \u201cWait,\u201d my assaulter said. I ran. I heard him chasing me through the streets, but I didn\u2019t look back. I sprinted into the building, quickly showing security my ID so I could get something in between me and him, something that would allow me to feel safe again. I went up to my dorm room and I laid in bed, wide awake. I didn\u2019t sleep for a second that whole night. \n\nThe next morning I knew I had to tell somebody. Following chain of command I went to the vice president, and thank God he immediately believed me. If it was not for his support in the immediate aftermath, I\u2019m not sure where I would be right now. We discussed next steps, which could include removing him as president and removing him from the brotherhood. After that conversation, I felt good about where things stood.\n\nThat evening, my assaulter texted me. He wanted to meet the next day to talk about what happened. In my stupidity I agreed to meet with him alone, although I was at least smart enough to say it had to be in a public place on campus. \n\nI got to the agreed location a few minutes early, wanting to have some time to sit down and prepare myself before he delivered his apology. Would I accept it or reject it? Would I tell him how powerless I felt in those moments, how emasculated I was, or would I brush it off and say it was no big deal? Would I ask him how he could have done what he did, how he could make me question everything I thought about my fraternity and my brothers?\n\nThe apology never came. The first thing he wanted to make clear to me was that he had no recollection of what happened, and that he doubted it had happened at all. I pressed him on this \u2013 I know that it happened, so how can you say that it didn\u2019t?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not my type.\u201d Those words sliced through me like daggers, cutting me deep to my core. I already felt worthless because of what he had done \u2013 and now he was telling me he couldn\u2019t have done it, because I wasn\u2019t good enough. The still fresh wounds had been ripped even wider, and in that moment I wanted to die.\n\nNo more than a week later we had an emergency meeting to determine what we should do about the incident. To everybody\u2019s surprise, the president was a no-show. He did provide a written statement in which he acknowledged what he did, and apologized to the fraternity for the trouble it had caused. I still never got that personal apology, but I had moved past wanting one by that point. After some discussion, we first voted to remove him as president before ultimately voting to remove him from the fraternity entirely.\n\nFollowing those votes our vice president became president, which left the vice presidency vacant. I knew I wanted to hold leadership positions from the second I joined, so I ran along with two of my pledge brothers. While we gave our speeches, the other candidates were sequestered to another room. While we were sequestered together, my pledge brother uttered the sentence that devastated me most out of the entire ordeal.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re doing this to him.\u201d\n\nI may have cursed at him, but I mostly remember just stewing on that. When my freshman year started I thought I had found my new teammates, my brothers who would always have my back. Now in a week\u2019s time the president who I thought I could trust most had betrayed that trust and my own pledge brother was telling me I was at fault for the entire ordeal. I questioned everything. Did I make a mistake in joining the fraternity? Should I have kept this to myself to avoid all the trouble? Did I make too big of a deal out of it? Was it my fault?\n\nThose questions represented the birth of a voice in my head. A voice that told me that the answer to all those questions is a resounding no, but whatever had happened that night, it doesn\u2019t matter. You are a MAN, and men don\u2019t let bad shit like that keep them down. It doesn\u2019t affect them. They\u2019re warriors, they fight through anything, and you didn\u2019t even get physically hurt. You\u2019re fine. You just need to make sure they all understand that you\u2019re the biggest man in any room you walk into.\n\nA summer away from campus allowed me to compartmentalize, to suppress, and to ignore. I committed myself to lifting weights, chopping wood, binge drinking, anything that could restore my now dwindling and fraught masculinity. When I came back to campus for sophomore year I hushed anybody who tried to mention the incident. I was convinced I was normal again, and on the surface I was. My grades were good, I was stepping forward as a leader in the fraternity, and I strived to be the life of the party at every social event.\n\nBut beneath that surface I was far from fine, and the cracks showed. I would get angry over small things with my brothers, threatening violence to make them feel the fear that I felt that night. I skipped entire weeks of classes due to drinking on a nightly basis and the ensuing hangovers. I was emotionally distant with the girls I dated, refusing to let any of them get close but desperate to keep them around as proof to everybody that I was the man I thought I was.\n\nIn the rare moments where I found myself alone, away from the parties and the girls and the brothers, I felt dead inside. If I watched TV, I stared into the light mindlessly. If I tried to read, my eyes simply glossed over the pages, not processing any of the words written on them. This got worse and worse until one night my junior year, I went into my bathroom and stared in the mirror for what felt like hours, unable to recognize the face that gazed back at me. I wanted to cry \u2013 but I was too numb, and nothing came out.\n\nToday, four years after I graduated, I\u2019m doing better. I\u2019m no longer obsessed with proving myself to everybody I meet, content to let my actions speak for themselves. I\u2019ve often thought of going to therapy, but that little voice in my head that tells me that a man doesn\u2019t need to go to therapy keeps winning out. Every time we have that argument though, the little voice gets a bit smaller. I hope one day it disappears entirely. Then I may be able to one day consider myself fully healed.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I started out wanting insight but it turned into me just trying give myself clarity through writing. \n\nI was with my ex for nearly three years. Living together for two of those years. In the last year our relationship got increasingly tense. He broke up with me for a day last summer over a whirlwind argument about me misplacing his debit card. I was still very enmeshed and invested in our relationship so that time I was absolutely devastated and begged for him to take me back. I recall him calmly playing videogames with his friend while I was in the other room sobbing that night.  Things got better for a while. I told him I would change as obviously he pinned the decline of our relationship on me. There were ups and downs though. I remember telling myself around fall that if things didn't change for the better I would leave him when I could afford to around tax time. \n\nThen two days before Christmas and three before my birthday he broke up with me again over an argument about him refusing to turn down the volume of the videogames he was playing at 4am as I was trying to sleep. I was being pretty calm about it too.  It was a small argument that blew up. I crashed at a friends place over the holidays. I was still wailing and devastated, but a little less so. I think a lot of frustration was with the fact that I'd have to move states away, be nearly homeless, or live with an abusive BPD friend. It took two days for him to come back around this time, and I took him back. Of course because I really missed him but also because it was convenient.  \n\n\nI couldn't fully put my heart back in the relationship this time. I never really got an apology for that massive breach of trust the flippant breakups were. Or an acknowledgement of of things HE'S been doing wrong. Instead his behavior has gotten worse and worse. Pushing his friends away with his recklessness, being a stubborn asshole, and not being able to accept the tiniest of character defects among them while never realizing his own. Stealing drugs from his mother all the time. On our first anniversary he stole pills from me. Has stolen Xanax from my mother. Constantly calling off from his job instead of finding a another and putting in a 2 weeks. He quit out of grief about a friends death and I was very understanding of that of course. But being the only provider was too much stress after four months of him being unemployed while still keeping up his weed habit. Other standard narc stuff. There is a fine example in my post history. \n\nBy this point in the relationship he has subtly convinced me I'm nothing but a depressed, half assed, idiot loser. He'd see fault in everything I would do. I was always walking on eggshells to avoid the biting remarks. He would never say anything extremely harsh it was just through conditioning over the years that I had normalized. Taking advantage of my shitty self esteem I guess.\n\n\nMy salvation came from two of our friends. One of them has been a best friend of his since high school, the other her fianc\u00e9.  We had begun to stay the night at there place very often and I'd gotten really close to both of them. Over time they started to see how my now ex \"emotionally abused\" me. One night we had all watched the movie A Clockwork Orange and afterwards Ex was trying to debate to me and his longtime friend that Alex, the main character was not a sociopath because he was too friendly. Me and friend had to point out that sociopaths are often very charming to manipulate people and cite criteria from the DSM. He didn't care what a bunch of psychologists had to say though. He does this thing where he will argue with you and deconstruct the argument to where it literally makes no sense anymore and bully you for not being able to refute nonsense. There is no winning an argument with him, just bullying from him. I tried to end the argument because he had to wakeup to work early in the morning so I tried to cuddle him but he pushed my arm off him. I tried again and he pushed me away again. I went to bathroom to sob. Eventually my friends found me and took me on a long drive and helped me unpack the abuse.  After that night my heart was mostly out of the relationship. \n\n\nWithin the next week there was a night in which he pushed me away from him again. He was looking depressed so I tried to comfort him. He told me he didn't want me to kiss him. He said he felt so alone, which is something he has always said no matter how hard I tried to get him to let me in. This time I could admit there was some truth to it now. I tried to explain to him that I never regained trust after the Christmas breakup and have been feeling distant. That it was hard for me to have my heart in it when I didn't feel admired or the least bit respected.  He verbatim said **\"What is there to admire about you\"** That was the moment I knew it was over. I went to the bathroom to cry then collected myself and packed a bag and left for my friends house. As I was leaving he gave a half assed apology. The next day he tried to gaslight me and say he was posing that as an actual question, which was obviously not his intent. He broke up with me through text the next morning because I wasn't there to give him a ride to his new job, which he could take the bus too. I was self centered, he said. \n\n\nIt only took a few days for him to beg for me back. As I write this it's been a month since I left. I've been living with my awesome friends and it's been very good on that front.  The guilt for not taking him back has eaten away at me. He has sobbed and sobbed. Said he would change. Realizes that I have a lot to admire and the reason he's so lonely is that he never let me get too close. Went to emergency inpatient. Wrote me a heartfelt apology letter and showed up at my job to give it to me. Begged and cried for me back. Tells me he deserves a second chance and I should just realize he is mentally ill and give it to him.\n\nI feel so guilty. I used to think he was my soulmate and we'd spend forever together. I couldn't imagine a life without him. What if he would change? How can I hurt him like this? Am I the narcissist? Am I just discarding him? \nStill despite all these thoughts I just can't do it anymore. I can't put my heart back in. I know it's over whether I'm the bad guy or not.\n\nIf anyone actually read this I thank you. It took a life of it's own. I just needed to make sense of this.

Usually people used to get away with it simply because I did not realize that I wasn't at fault. I think that my ex guilt tripped me a lot and that turned a simple depressive episode into a massive downfall.\n\nI already started a therapy because I felt depression sneaking in before I met him. I also had exhausted myself from studying, working, and doing political work at the same time before our relationship began. So when we became a couple I was already tired all the time. Then his constant nagging started and it sort of became a fulltime job for me to satisfy him while at the same time my mental health went down the drain. I was completely stupid for giving him so much attention but I learned from it and now I take even better care of myself so the story has a happy ending for me at least. :)\n\nAnyway, lets get back to the start of our relationship. The first red flag I ignored was when he told me that his last ex girlfriend was \"crazy\" and that his male friends helped him out of the relationship. Back then I thought that he was such a poor guy and that I am going to treat him better. Well guess what... at the end of our relationship I turned into the \"crazy\" girlfriend, too and stupid as I was, I felt at fault. His male friends told me how bad I treated him and that he didn't like the way I behaved but he never told that to my face. I think there never was a huge problem with me but he kept telling his friends otherwise so he could harvest their compassion. \n\nHe also tried to harvest some compassion from my friends by telling them how deeply he cared for my mental well-being and that he has to nurse me (which was not true). My friends therefore turned to me and told me how he paints me as almost mentally challenged. They told him that they know me since years and that he had no reason to believe that I cannot take care of my own ass. \n\nWhen I heard how he spoke about me behind my back I called him and raised my voice at him. I was so angry I thought I would explode. Then he guilt tripped me because I raised my voice and from that moment on he cancelled the relationship. I now think he tried to punish me because I suddenly was addressing his behavior. Back then of course I thought it was all my fault because I got angry. It took me one year to figure out that I had every right to be angry after all he did to me. Basically he had tried to mute me by telling everyone we knew that I was crazy and for women the crazy label is like a death sentence since so many people fall for that trope. Also it will attract the next victim that is trying to take care of the poor guy.\n\nNow that I realize that he is a bully who guilt trips the shit out of women I try to see the funny side of his disturbed reality.  For example I ran into him like two times after the break up and he tried to speak to me but I refused because that poor guy should really not have to speak to a crazy women. :D   Also when he broke up with me he tried to make me feel guilty by comparing me to another woman. He told me a story about a girl who hosted him for two nights during a couch surfing trip. He said that the girl took a lot of care of him (she was basically a good host) and how I should have done the same. Lol if he expects women to treat him as if he was a guest that might work out well for two nights but eventually will turn everyone crazy after a couple of months.

She had a boyfriend of 3 years that I never really talked to. About a month after her passing her boyfriend messaged me a lot. He was constantly telling me how sad he was and how he couldn\u2019t handle life. I felt so bad for him. So I would comfort him for hours. The moment I\u2019d stop messaging him though he would bombard me with messages until I replied again. I thought that was weird but I figured he needed my friendship so I would talk to him. \n\nThen he asked me if I could help him move because I own a truck. He was staying with his girlfriends parents because her parents did want them to have to pay bills while she was going through cancer treatment. He told me that her parents kicked him out and put his stuff on the street. He also said that her parents wont let him get his stuff so I had to pack it all up on my own. When I got there her parents were really nice and helped me pack. His stuff wasn\u2019t on the street either. It was still in their room where he left it. They also asked me why he didn\u2019t want to stay there anymore and to relay the message that he always has a home with them. \n\nAfter I helped him move everything he asked me to stay over and that he needed a friend because he was extremely sad. I agreed even though it was late (around midnight). He immediately got out alcohol and told me I should drink. I told him that I really didn\u2019t want to and he pressured me until I said yes. He made me take shot after shot. I was so drunk I could barely stand by the end of it. He then grabbed me by my arm and took me to his bed. I knew what was happening and I told him no and tried to get away but he was stronger than me. He raped me that night. \n\nThe next day I went home and he messaged me \u201cyou\u2019re my girlfriend now. I hope you had as much fun as I did!\u201d I told him I wasn\u2019t sure about things and I was confused. I also said I didn\u2019t want to date him because I felt that would be so disrespectful to my best friend. He then messaged me saying how my best friend would want us to be together. That if I don\u2019t date him he will kill himself. That I\u2019m the only thing that brings him joy in this world. So I agreed to date him. \n\nFor about 3 months our relationship was him ignoring me all day long then him being extremely sweet at night and inviting me over. He would then be super sweet to me in person. But if I didn\u2019t have sex with him he\u2019d get really upset. I\u2019d also have to bring him food every night. He\u2019d make me pay for everything. When I would express that he\u2019s treating me bad he would say things like \u201cwell at least I\u2019m not beating you! Count your blessings!\u201d Or that I was over reacting. He also raped me multiple times in our relationship and blamed it all on alcohol. Or would tell me it didn\u2019t happen. \n\nI finally had the courage to cut all contact with him and he bombarded me with messages saying that he loved me so much and that I broke his heart. That I was a horrible person. \n\nI had no contact with him for 2 years. Recently I messaged him because I really wanted to just know why he was so twisted. When I messaged him he messaged me back saying how sorry he was and he admitted to raping me and admitted to treating me like absolute shit. Then when I tried asking him some questions he ignored me and left me on read. Finally I messaged him expressing my feelings and saying if he\u2019s sorry he would be a little better about replying. He gave me the excuse that he doesn\u2019t really talk to anyone so he forgets to message people for weeks but he cares about me. It\u2019s the same excuse he\u2019d always do. \n\nI told him how I wanted to go to therapy because everything that happened has been getting too much for me. He begged and begged that I don\u2019t go and that he would talk every thing out with me. I said okay and he left me on read again for weeks. I then told him I\u2019m going to therapy and then he messaged back instantly and suggested we meet up. I said okay and he made plans with me to meet the next day and he just ignored me all day. That happened a few more times. I then finally messaged him telling him I\u2019m giving up on him. \n\nHe messaged me panicking and said that he\u2019s meeting me tomorrow at 9. I told him no. He then told me I have no choice and I better show up because he will be waiting there all day and it would be shitty of me to leave him waiting. So I felt guilty and went. \n\nWhen we met in person it was just 4 hours of him telling me how miserable his life is. When I would try to talk about my feelings and what is bothering me to him he would ignore what I said completely and change the conversation. \n\nHe sends me long messages sometimes of him telling me how much he cares about me but then yet the moment I try to tell him my feelings he will ignore me or change the subject. Is this a person who cares? Is he a narcissist? Advice is really appreciated. I\u2019ve been struggling with this for awhile.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

She lost interest in sex and blamed it on her medications. So she lowered her dosage. She also told me a few months later she was having doubts about wanting kids. When we first got together she said she wanted marriage and kids one day. I was about to leave when she told me that but she begged me to stay and said that she was 99% sure it was the medicine making her doubt what she wanted. I stayed 6 more months till my anxiety took over me and I was constantly having panic attacks. She was going back and forth about having kids and was saying that she didn't not want kids but that she could go with or without them. Then she said she wanted kids with me just not anyone else. She even once said I could have kids with her one day if I let her get another dog. I was having to choose between her and my dream of one day having a family. \n\nI got the courage to leave mid July. I had to find a new place to live and couldn't move out till August 10. After the first week of the break up she was saying how she couldn't lose me, that I am her world, that she loves me, and that she is going to fix her issues and come back for me and marry me. A week later she wanted nothing to do with me. She would intentionally avoid coming home to be around me. After a suspicion I had, I caught her on dating apps and when I confronted her she initially played dumb like she didn't know what I was talking about. When I showed her a screenshot of her profile she was quick to say she made the profile to see if I would go on there to see if she was on there. \n\nAfter I moved out, I found out she had already started dating someone 2 weeks after the break up and were official by August 1. I hadn't even moved out yet and she already had someone. I also found out that when I wasn't there on the weekends she was having the new girl over. When I confronted her about it she blatantly denied it and told me to move on and to stop worrying about what she was doing and that she was single. The biggest punch to the gut was that not only was the girl not that attractive, but my ex gave her a $20 ring from Amazon two days after I moved out on August 12. I could never get a ring but this girl got one within 2 weeks. The girl also seems to have moved in and they are already taking big vacations together. \n\nI am so hurt and confused. I left because she wouldn't commit to me long term by marrying me because she was afraid of being trapped but within 2 weeks she had someone else and acts like I never meant anything to her and she buys this girl a cheap ring.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I had a pretty rough 4 years up until the end of 2018. Found myself to be giving a lot of myself to a very toxic person who I dated for 4 years, that I loved and cared for very much.\n\nMy therapist said they are have NPD and most likely BPD... When I examined my relationship to them being an empath I explained how good it was as my brain and heart always overrides bad behaviour and traits in people with the good underneath and that's all I see. \n\nI'm convinced she has borderline personality disorder. As she was such a kind person deep down and had a good heart and she ticked all the boxes of BPD. \n\n-She had fast changes into knowing I was a kind and loving guy to someone who wasn't right for her and a bad partner. This ultimately ended up with her thinking like this. Made me on edge whole relationship always trying not to disagree or upset her. \n\n- she would talk question her life at times to me and I'd always aid her and motivate her. But it'll always loop back around. \n\n-  she'd always get mood swings she'd take out on me and always self criticising herself. It'd upset me intensely. \n\n\nMy therapist helped me see this, with the help of my friends and family\u2019s input on how they viewed her. But I knew these points from start of the relationship, think part of that was being an empath. \n\nI've always found myself being able to read people's emotions and moods without them even telling me. And they'd turn me and say how did you know I was feeling or thinking that and I thought this was normal back in the day.\n\nShe had been dealing with depression pretty much all of her life. She even told me of self harm and all of the bad things that happened with her childhood. It made me feel bad and gave me a strong sense and need to help and support her out of this.\n\nAll throughout my life I have always been helping others. I cannot not do it. It's a need, I feel good helping others it actually lifts me up like nothing else\u2026 that's another key characteristic of an empath is that we feel the need to help and save those in need. Which is awesome but can become dangerous, as I like many empaths will put those they love 1st and make the sacrifice of saving another and losing ourselves in the process.\n\nShe was struggling with very bad depression, self destructiveness and anxiety. Those 4 years I\u2019d found myself trying my best and sacrificing so much of my time being there to support her through it all.\n\nIt was my mission, like literally I made it a priority over all my own priorities in life to get her out of it so we could be happy together. I knew if I couldn't itd tire me out and shed leave once that happened.\n\nShe told me I was her ride or die and the one. I realised this was probably bullshit just to keep me roped in. As she would always tell me how special I was and that she would not leave me no matter how tough things would become and I promised her the same back\u2026 But only I meant it and would have done.\n\nIt ended up happening, she left me eventually\u2026 I became exhausted mentally and physically in the 2nd year of the relationship, I knew it was from helping her. My parents and friends would tell me too. Which was the hardest part, but they knew it was making me happy helping her as I would always tell them why I was doing it.\n\nThe last two years was when it all got to me and I completely lost who I was. I found myself feeling depressed, destructive and anxious all the time. I was picking up all of her emotions and struggles and they completely became my own as I struggled to figure out if I was feeling my emotions or hers. This is a trait of being an empath too, which I had no clue of at the time.\n\nIt was a minefield of confusion. I had no idea what was happening to me. My friends and family would say I don't seem like me anymore. A few work colleagues who I was friends with at work said the same thing.\n\nFrom then on, I knew something was wrong. My closest friends told me before the relationship I was such a happy and outgoing person, always helping others and just joyful with life. They would call me Joku, as they all said I reminded them of Goku in an anime haha. And through out the relationship I turned into the opposite. It was scary.\n\nAs I recall a very distinct memory of my ex saying she feels I\u2019ve become more like her and she's become more like me. My therapist had even told me she was draining me and feeding off of this to lift her up.\n\nI just thought my efforts in supporting her and her dreams were making her happier and I was actually getting her out of her depression for good! But she was draining me...\n\nTo be honest, deep down I knew she was. But when you really love someone very deeply and really care for them you make the sacrifices in hopes they will change. But I had to learn a hard lesson, I cant save everyone and sometimes people just can't be saved from their pasts.\n\nBut I will say love is very different for an empath as my therapist explained to me in great detail as I found myself extremely heartbroken at the end of it all. Love is intense just as it is for anyone, but for an empath its on another level.\n\nI worked two jobs in those final two years in the relationship which were very taxing on my mind as well.\n\nI was barely holding on with her and the jobs just added more extra weight as I was very mistreated and manipulated for my kind and helpful nature. I could never say no and found myself saying yes and doing other people's work and this just added more exhaustion and confusion to my feelings.\n\nIn my last job I was working away and the commute was very very tiring and long. On top of that I was dealing with a boss who was using me to do his own work. Which yes I was well aware of but being an empath I didn't want to create any tension and was afraid to say no. I was already exhausted mentally enough with helping in the relationship.\n\nAnd helping was my thing. I couldn't say no. My ex was also working some very tough jobs in call centres throughout those last two years and I knew it was driving her crazy. It was disheartening her so much, I could feel her pain to the point I couldn\u2019t sleep most nights.\n\nI found myself taking my support to another level. As she wanted more out of me, I dind\u2019t understand what else I could give... In one of her call centre jobs, she messaged me questioning her life and what the point of it all was. This was the norm throughout the relationship and I found myself constantly having to uplift her and motivate her.\n\nIn that job I ended up biking out from my job to come and see her on her lunch breaks, in hopes to put a smile on her face and to show her I believe in her and that she will make it with her goals.\n\nAs sadly I knew if she gave up her pursuit to be a singer. I knew things would not work out for us, I knew she'd give up on us. So her goal became mine and throughout those 4 years most weekends we would be creating music videos, photos and artwork. \n\nI am a multimedia designer. So I used my skills to help her make her dreams come true in any way that I could. It had its ups and downs as it was extremely tiring for me doing video as a job and then spending most of my weekends doing it for her also.\n\nShe would help me with my instagram also, but it felt very controlling and she would get pissed off if I didn\u2019t manage my instagram her way. Like another guilt trip and it would make me feel terrible inside if I say no.\n\nIt was extremely manipulating as being an empath id say yes to anyone. I had this abuse in jobs and with people who used me for my helpful nature.\n\nI started to lose a sense of reality. I started to doubt myself, and my decisions. She constantly made me feel as if I was doing something wrong even though I knew I wasn\u2019t. She\u2019d always make me feel guilty and make it obvious that I wasn't meeting her expectations.\n\nI found myself taking my support to another level. As she wanted more out of me, I didn't understand what else I could give... In one of her call centre jobs, she messaged me questioning her life and what the point of it all was. This was the norm throughout the relationship and I found myself constantly having to uplift her and motivate her.\n\nShe would just want more and more and more. It was a very intense battle to stay with her, hoping she would change and that all my support would be doing something. But it soon just zapped the life out of me.\n\nIn the last year of our relationship. I was at my worst, the worse ive ever been in my life. I wasn\u2019t myself anymore. Found myself questioning my own reality and what was real and what wasn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t trust her at all and I was right not to.\n\nI began to develop depression and anxiety like I spoke about previously. I struggled with work as I recognised my boss was manipulating me and getting me to over work and was setting me up to fail as he knew I was on to his games and I think he feared me reporting him.\n\nMy mind at this point was going crazy, I didn\u2019t know who to trust, why I was feeling exhausted, mentally and physically. I explained to my ex all of the struggles I was having at work and how its affecting me. It was like she didn\u2019t care, she would tell me it\u2019s just work stress.\n\nShe would tell me every time to talk to my boss. So I did and he would tell me to find another job if I couldn\u2019t manage the work, which was his work I was doing overtime. I ended up calling my ex at least 3 to 4 times a week, and most mornings dreading work.\n\nI would get no emotional support. It was horrible. It was odd, as after we broke up I went to a friend for emotional support on the same topic and they were so supportive and even booked me into a therapist.\n\nBut in the last year of our relationship around all of the stress and toxic people I was dealing with, including her. She was, instead of supporting me in a really rough time, she was talking to a producer she worked. She was speaking to him daily, she didn\u2019t think I knew, but I did\u2026\n\nI was waiting for her to admit it to me. You can\u2019t hide any lies from an empath, she didn\u2019t know I noticed the changes in her behaviour and vibes. How distant she became and the big red flag was that she knew I was going through a rough spot, but she would hardly talk to me. Because her attention was elsewhere.\n\nMy therapist this year explained to me she seemed very narcissistic. And when she drained me over the 4 years and realise I wasn\u2019t meeting her needs. She was looking for a new supply. She felt alone and I couldn\u2019t support her as my mind was messed up from her toxic traits and manipulation.\n\nShe also for the 1st time during our relationship made new friends at work. My god ive been pushing this girl to make new friends throughout our relationship. As for no reasonable reason, she pushed her friendship group away when she got with me. \n\nAfter our relationship ended she is now back in that friendship group once again. My therapist explained once she left me and found a supply in her new work friends and her old friends, that was enough for her to discard me.\n\nBut a few months after our breakup she pops up. Asks me to do another music video for her\u2026 Just using me for something she knows she can get from me again. I almost said yes, because I want to help people and I loved her so that need, to help was amplified.\n\nBut luckily a close friend stopped me from saying yes. As he knew that I would have done the video and the video was about our break up or something along those lines. She also asked me to remain friends with her and I am glad I did not.\n\nMy therapist explained that this also is another way a narcissist keeps you in their life just incase their new supply doesn\u2019t work out. And I was informed by one of her close friends she is dating the model she used to act as me in the music video she asked me to do.\n\nThis is her new supply. I feel bad for the guy, as he doesn\u2019t know, she is just love bombing him, then once she is used to him like she did me will tire him out with her problems, then she will discard him and move on to the next victim.\n\nI am still in doubt to believe she is a narcissist and wanted to get an insight from any of you redditors! As I am an empath I always see the best in people even those who clearly do me wrong.\n\nShe wasn't a bad person though might I add. She was nice inside once I opened her up. But I do realise through my therapist and a lot of research that narcissists do make it seem they are nice on the outside, but have a lot of issues on the inside which ruin relationships.\n\nI am mainly posting this in hopes to give insight and help to others. I really don\u2019t want anyone going through anything like this! Especially empaths or highly sensitive people. As we get caught in a cycle of giving and giving and they are never happy in the end. It tires us out and can really ruin a life.\n\nLuckily my life was not ruined by it. I got the support and therapy I needed to overcome it this year. And I am even helping my therapist write an article on empaths and also dealing with narcissistic and borderline abuse from a partner or ex.\n\nI am back to being my happy, high spirited and loving self to all those around me as I\u2019ve always been! Just feels every day incredible to be back and be working my dream job and helping others going through similar or just life struggles of their own.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My heart goes out to those who have had a much worse experience than I have. As soon as I realized I was losing myself I sought therapy, after one session I realized that I WAS NOT THE PROBLEM, it was the relationship that was crashing my life straight into a wall. I broke things off with the narcissist within days of that realization and they acted like they didn't even care, like I was oh so disposable...a loving caring person doesn't do that. It crippled me until I was able to pack my things and drive 3,000 miles away. I am glad I had the option to not stick around and find out what more they would try to do to me. I don't have to know what he is saying, I don't have to know what he is doing or who he is with and I don't want to know either. You have to act as if the person you fell in love with DIED. That is the only way to move forward with your life. Even if they are the covert and are seemingly \"unthreatening\" they still have the potential to be very dangerous. Although mine never threatened me directly the way he talked about getting revenge on people he felt wronged by really scared me. He would always tell me that he could be a very dangerous person if he wanted to be I didn't think much of it at the time, but now even with an incredible distance between us, I am afraid that I will need to look over my shoulder every day for the rest of my life. I think deep down part of what had me stay in the relationship longer than I should have was the fear of being on the narcissist's bad side, but I came to accept that sooner or later I would be the target of his rage. Does anyone else now live with the paranoia that someday the narcissist will come for their revenge?  \n\n\nJust wanted to throw in an edit here: I keep trying to understand my own motivations for being in and staying this relationship, I think in part it was worrying about the day when this person would view me the way they viewed other people who \"wronged\" them, but I also thought that I could love the anger out of them. I could also relate to the pain I know they felt deep inside, I guess it's a lot more complicated than I thought.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Immediately feeling awful for even thinking that.\n\nBasically, my entire body and soul was telling me to get out, but he had me so brainwashed that I didn't deserve him and I owed him my life. Sometimes I even still blame myself. One of the hardest things was feeling like I \"threw away\" 7 years. Working towards building a life together. But it was never mine. It was all his life and what he wanted. I could have been anyone.\n\nI left a year and a half ago. It took every ounce of courage I had in me. It took several friends and my parents to help get me out of there and back home.  I'm now in a relationship with one of my childhood best friends. I'm still recovering from the past, but for the first time, the future doesn't seem scary. I have learned that love isn't supposed to hurt. The thought of getting a house, marrying him or having kids someday are all things that make me smile. He understands that I am recovering from abuse and helps me through it every day.\n\nDid anyone else get these gut feelings that something was wrong? How did you cope with them? When did you finally let yourself feel them and see the abuse for what it was? And how are you doing now?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I have been with my current fianc\u00e9 for four years. He is everything that I have dreamed for in life. We have an amazing deep relationship. We have a wonderful business together where we play country music and perform gigs together. We are truly connected and he is my everything. But, I have a narcissistic ex boyfriend who I was with before my current fianc\u00e9 that has been haunting my thoughts for the past five years, most intensely the past two weeks. I wasn\u2019t with that person for a very long time but the abuse that I had gone through while I was with him was enough to land me in a mental hospital when it ended. I did go to therapy after it was completely over. It ended because he hit me, held a shotgun to me in bed, almost sent naked pictures of me to my bosses, and I filed a restraining order and had to go through all of the court proceedings to get a protection against him. I went to therapy for about a year, I developed severe pure-obsessive compulsive disorder with romantic relationship intrusive obsessive thoughts. It was absolutely horrible and I am still somewhat fragile today when it comes to obsessive thinking. Which explains today...... i\u2019m getting married to the love of my life in less than a month and all of the sudden I\u2019m having disturbing flashbacks of my ex. I\u2019m having flashbacks of when he used to tell me I was a worthless slut and that I would never amount to anything without him and that I shouldn\u2019t take a new job because my old job that gave me less money was perfectly fine. I\u2019m remembering the times that he delusional thought I was a porn star and that I lied to him about my sexual past and that I must have AIDS because I was such a whore. I\u2019m remembering all the times that he never let me see my family and that he kept me from my family on Christmas. I\u2019m remembering all the times that he would recklessly drive with me in the car and involuntarily trap me in his car while he went to do drug deals. I\u2019m remembering all the times that he never let me leave the basement and he locked me in a closet in the basement. I\u2019m remembering all the times when he used to watch me shower because he didn\u2019t want me to go anywhere or call my parents. I\u2019m remembering all the times that he would stand in front of my car so I wouldn\u2019t leave his house during a fight, or when he would chain smoke cigarettes ashing on the floor of my car with the windows closed. \n\nAnyway, you get the picture. I don\u2019t know how to get all of these images and memories out of my head. They are totally spoiling my exciting time right now before our beautiful wedding.

That would be so easy to refute. And obvious. This is more insidious. \n\nEvery knock down drag out fight where he would completely loose his shit on me was made to be my fault. He would find SOMETHING to make it my fault. And it would then make sense to me. Basically what it would come down to is I\u2019m not a 100% perfect human being. So if I did ANYTHING imperfect in that argument, he would seize on it. And that\u2019s where the self blame comes from. All the questioning. \n\nThis last time i told him i didn\u2019t think it was a good idea to angrily text someone when he was drunk. That\u2019s all I said. Gave him a kiss and walked away to do my own thing. I was relentlessly hunted down to explain my reasoning. Justify myself. Justify my fucking existence. Basically explain how I dared to question or even point out something he was doing was wrong. I was asked over and over again why I thought the things I did. (All of this is of course after he\u2019s thrown f bombs and every insult under the sun at the person he was texting) Each time calmly explaining what I thought. The basics of why drunkenly texting angry thoughts is a bad idea. After still being hounded, I told him I knew what it felt like to be on the end of something like that. He knew what I meant. For 7 years I\u2019ve been that person. \n\nThat was the end. Now I\u2019ve made \u201ceverything about us\u201d! Everything was \u201cfine until you made it about us!\u201d I now get to deal with his drunken abuse being \u201cjustifiably\u201d leveled at me. Because I made it about us. And THATS the real problem here. Nothing else. \n\nHuge fight. I walk off. Leave the next day. Followed by his texts that he did nothing wrong except, at one point in the blowout, say I was an unloving wife. But everything else was my fault. The \u201cunloving wife\u201d comment was the least of my concern. So we argue through text where I tell him I\u2019ve had it with the making everything my fault. He digs his heels in and insists it\u2019s all me. \n\nAfter a few hours I start reminiscing about how charming he can be. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I always do this shit. But not wanting to be the complete doormat I am, I rationalize with myself that I would rather be happy than right. I know he\u2019s in the wrong but hey, we are married. It doesn\u2019t matter. Stop digging my own heels in and insisting I\u2019m right. \n\nSo I call him up. Tell him I don\u2019t want to fight anymore. Yada yada yada. \n\nThat night I come home. Give him a kiss. Tell him I haven\u2019t slept more than hour because I legitimately haven\u2019t. I\u2019ve been freaking out the entire day. So I\u2019m going to head up to bed but ask him to come visit when he gets a chance. \n\nHe eventually does. Cold as fuck and lays next to me. I tell him I would rather be happy than just argue about who\u2019s right. He again lays into me about how it\u2019s my fault. How he feels alone in the marriage because I dismiss him like I did when I said I didn\u2019t think it was a good idea. I\u2019m quiet and just listen. He tells me \u201cwho cares if you think it\u2019s a good idea or not?\u201d Tells me how everything was fine until I made it about us. And that\u2019s why he\u2019s so upset. Again just listen. \n\nAfter that night, I continue with the thought in my head that I would rather be happy than right. But I\u2019m suddenly put into time out. He\u2019s completely withdrawn from me. \n\nNow I\u2019m loosing my shit internally. Fuck him. Fuck this shit. Fuck the marriage. I withdraw. That was 4 days ago. Haven\u2019t spoken since. Pretty sure we will divorce. And here I am still doubting myself. Still wondering if he\u2019s right that I\u2019m dismissive. That he\u2019s alone in the marriage. That I don\u2019t stand up for him. And now we will divorce because I\u2019m such a bitch and can\u2019t just keep my mouth shut.

I instructed him to undress and that we had to touch our genitals together to have babies, which we did (no penetration just mashing)\n\nI started masturbating a little around that age as well.\n\nBetween 6-8 I remember playing \"naughty doctor\" with a few different friends consistently which in addition to normal \"checkups\" also involved the doctor being naughty and looking at and touching genitals.\n\nAt 8 I became of age for my religion and learned more about what sex is and that I shouldn't do that and so I mostly stopped those types of games with friends.\n\nWhen I was about 9 a couple times I got my two younger cousins (girls 4 and 5) to undress so I could look at their genitals and I let them to at mine. I also remember leading my friends in learning to make out and telling my friends I really wanted to have sex with an older man.\n\nI started watching porn when I was about 10 . I masturbated compulsively every day from about 9 until about 13. I had a lot of shame about it and I would keep going until it hurt and I physically had to stop, repeat the next day.\n\nWe had quite a bit of neglect due to one parent being sick and the other checking out and a string of family members living with us to care for me and my siblings. \n\nNot sure if this is normal and the difference is the lack of supervision or if it is possible I was abused and don't remember.

I feel ready to share my story.\n\nI met my narc at a very vulnerable time in my life. *Of course.* I had finished up college and was spending my first fall after school working at a brewery in my college town. I had a great college experience and it was a difficult life transition for me so I was seeing a therapist about figuring out my next steps. Little did I know I would have one of my biggest life lessons coming my way. I'd been on a few dates with a guy and after one of the dates had gone poorly I was feeling especially vulnerable. I hadn't seriously dated in a few years and I felt like I just couldn't click with anyone.\n\nThen I met *him*. He came with his girlfriend at the time to a bonfire I was hosting. Living in a small community I knew he wasn't from around my town so he introduced himself and said he'd recently moved to the area and just got a job at the brewery I also worked at. I thought he was cute, friendly, and goofy but something just seemed *off.* I would do anything to go back in time to listen to my intuition.\n\nAs we worked together and spent more time together he seemed to infiltrate himself into my life. He'd be at lunches with me and my friends, parties, work, etc. He was just always around. We had everything in common. He made me laugh harder than anyone had ever made me laugh before. He came off as a bit shy and goofy and insecure...endearing. He would catch my eye and look at me at such an intense way that I had never had with anyone else.  It felt like a movie. I started looking forward to every moment with him. I told him about my insecurities, my dreams, my passions. He understood me. I told him how I was planning a trip around Europe in the spring and that I was excited to have saved up money for it.\n\nI never quite had understood where he had come from and why he was in my college town. He had moved from another state but had grown up nearby. He was dating a classmate of mine (who was known for being quite volatile, albeit a decent person) who he had met on Tinder. There were rumors of him getting kicked out of a family member's house and walking for a day with a backpack to get to my town. He started to share with me all these wonderful stories from his past life in his old state: having an amazing (but crazy, duh) girlfriend, a great indie band, brewing beer and bartending at a world-class brewery, being in the army, being in theater productions, teaching pre-school, amazing backpacking trips and adventures. It was impressive and interesting, and not unplausible. He showed me pictures and told me the most detailed stories. The half-truths are his hallmark. I remember him adding me on Instagram when we first met and his tag line said something about being Christian and loving dogs and there was a picture of him and his ex the last Easter and she had a ring on her ring finger. The next time I looked at his page all that information was gone and I thought I must've imagined it.\n\nOne day we were working together and I asked about his current girlfriend and he said *oh no, we've been broken up for a few weeks, I realized she was crazy and really unhealthy for me*. (She did dramatically try to catch his suit on fire and then poured beer all over it, but it was probably warranted). He moved in with a close friend of mine because an apartment lease of his had fallen through (remember that) and his ex kicked him out. He and my friend got along really well and I trusted her judgment of people. I told her I had a crush on him despite him being in a very weird life situation. She told me to be careful. But I thought I could tell he was a really good guy and was just going through a tough time. He just seemed to be the victim of so many things falling through. Poor guy. He just needs someone loving and caring like me to help him through this had time!\n\nWe got breakfast one day, our first real date, and he was telling me about how much he loved acting. I made a comment that I don't like to date actors because you never know when they are lying.\n\nThere had been an attack on a synagogue in my city. The narc was Jewish and we were working together that day and I gave him my condolences and I could tell it really shook him up. I was shook up too. That night he told me how hard it was growing up Jewish in a small town and I held him as we both cried. I felt like we could really be vulnerable with each other after that.\n\nAfter a Halloween party, we finally hooked up. I hadn't felt so much sexual tension with a person in so long and it made me feel so alive. After not dating for a bit of time I had started to feel like there was something wrong with me. I remember that night when I went up the stairs to my bedroom he waited in the darkness at the bottom of the stairs for an unusual amount of time. That moment gives me chills now as I think of him probably mentally preparing for his next victim. We talked and laughed all night. I was hooked.\n\nAfter that, it was a honeymoon. We always wanted to be together. Everything was beautiful. It felt so amazing to fall in love. It was only my second time falling in love and I thought maybe it could be my last. The leaves changed, he played guitar and sang me songs. He learned The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan for me and I romantically thought of him as an artist out of his luck and on the road.\n\nSome things seemed off. I couldn't quite figure out why his life was in such shambles. He opened up about his difficult childhood and horrible family. He told me he had struggled with bipolar disorder and cocaine addiction. I knew those were major issues but didn't want to write him off because of it. We all have our issues. He said his mood swings were mild and he'd done a lot of therapy and they could be managed. I didn't like the way he yelled at his mom on the phone but I figured he was just stressed. My friend didn't seem to want him to live with her anymore and she was distancing herself from me too. She had also had some things recently stolen from her house. Tips mysteriously disappeared at work. We had to rescue the narc's dog from his ex's apartment as she was threatening to call animal control for him being a bad dog owner (I'm still unsure if he actually cares for the dog or just uses it but he acts like it is his baby). My life went from predictable and content to a vortex of drama and misfortune. Part of me found it exciting.\n\nA cop pulled us over one day driving home from work in the snow. Narc was driving my car and forgot to put the headlights on. The cop scanned his license and said it was suspended. Narc had a story for why that was and the cop let us go. I laughed in my head that narc might have a secret past that I don't know about.\n\nDespite things being hard, we just meshed together so well that it was perfect. I had waited so long for someone like him! Then, very suddenly, he decided to move two hours away to the city where I grew up. He said he was still reeling from the attack and wanted to reconnect with the Jewish community down there. I already had plans to eventually move home so I fast-tracked those plans to be closer to him.\n\nHe found a house in the new city, but then mysteriously he got kicked out of that house after a week too. He had a whole story about the women not liking his dog and unfairly kicking him out. He also asked me to loan him $200 for the pet deposit. I said yes. I had loaned plenty of money to my friends in the past. When he got kicked out I was so worried him and his dog would have nowhere to go. In reality, he did have nowhere to go. He didn't have friends or family around. I did. I could help him. He stayed with my best friend for a bit and then moved in with a classmate of mine who has leasing a room in her house.\n\nWe took a trip together to meet my two best friends and they loved him. They said they had never seen me so happy in such a long time. If my friends approved then I knew he was a keeper, they have good intuition. We had an incident that we went out one night and I started dancing in a friendly way with another guy and narc became furious and threw a tantrum and stormed off in an incredibly dramatic way. Which in my drunken state I found incredibly annoying and a bit funny. But in reality, it was a taste of his rage that would come later.\n\nI thought he was finally on track. He had a house, got a new job, I was driving 4 hours every week just to see him, and we were doing well and excited for the holidays. Over the holidays I met his family and thought they were really nice, but something seemed off with the way they interacted with him. Like they were unsure of him. And it seemed a bit like he was \"showing me off\" like a prized piece of meat. He always talked about how his family LOVED me and it made me feel really good. I had never celebrated Hannukkah before but appreciated learning about his culture and traditions. His pathologically lying/manipulative/alcoholic father who was living in his car at the time came to stay with narc for Christmas because narc felt bad for him (real empathy?). His dad made me and my friend very uncomfortable and just sat in the house drinking a case of beer and watching Nazi documentaries for Christmas. Narc was Jewish but also his birthday was on Christmas. He said he family had abandoned him (his dad didn't count as a real person and didn't even acknowledge his birthday despite being in the same house) and I felt bad for him. So even though it felt fast I brought him to my family's Christmas celebration. They all thought he was the nicest guy.\n\nThen, after New Year's I got a call from his mom. The call no one wants to get. *Narc has been in a serious accident. He was hit by a car on his bike heading to work. I don't know if he'll survive. He's in the ICU in the city.* That day I packed up everything, didn't have time to say goodbye to all of my friends or make peace with my life those 5 years, and moved back home. I spent the next week with him at the hospital. I'd never seen anyone I loved so close to death. His skull was fractured, his collarbone was broken, his heart had stopped briefly. But the whole time at the hospital he didn't complain, he made everyone laugh, the nurses loved him. Even though at this point we had only been together 2 months and I had some doubts - you can't break up with someone after they've been in an accident.\n\nThen things got worse. I received a picture from my boss of a local newspaper showing the narc as the county's \"most wanted\" for failing to appear in court for a bad checks charge. My world shattered. How could this be? His crazy father had to be to blame. I asked his mom what she thought and she said his father probably set him up too. After all, his father was a lying, cheating, abusive narcissist. I couldn't ask narc about it until he recovered enough to function and he had a very elaborate story about how his dad had set him up. It definitely didn't totally add up. But I was so completely traumatized from the past week that I believed anything he said.\n\nHis mom said he could go home with her and her boyfriend to recover. But he said then his dog would have to go to the kennel and he would recover better at his house with his dog. He also found his mom to be toxic and felt unwelcome in her home. I couldn't figure out why his grandparents wouldn't take him. I said I could help take care of him if I needed to and his mom basically said *perfect, he's your problem now.* She only visited him once after that. I moved my stuff into his house because it was my only way to take care of him. I became his 24/7 caretaker. I couldn't even see my own family because he had no one else to care for him. He needed help eating, bathing, moving, etc. I took time off work to be there with him. I supported him financially. His family totally abandoned me. I had a strong support system of my own but they could only do so much. I didn't understand why the world was so cruel. I had never felt so abandoned and trapped. It was the dead of winter.\n\nI was able to start a new job but I was incredibly stressed, depressed, and traumatized. I wanted to start to plan my trip abroad but I could barely just survive the day. I wanted to see my friends and family more but any time I would try to do it he would talk about how lonely and abandoned *he* felt. I tried to get him legal help from a friend to figure out what was going on with his warrant. He was disabled and a fugitive in his own house. I became a fugitive too. The manipulation during this time began to escalate in such a subtle and calculated way. He said the concussion doctors were amazed at his healing and the fact that he wasn't showing emotional symptoms from the concussion. But I knew his outbursts were escalating. Everything was always wrong, he was the victim, the whole world was against him. I could never do enough to help. He needed me to lend him more and more money. I was too traumatized to question it. He couldn't make rent. I felt awkward because he was paying rent to my friend. I didn't want to see him kicked out. Plus, it wasn't his fault he couldn't work right now.\n\nOn Valentine's day, one of his exes found me and messaged me to try to warn me about him. She said to never lend him money (too late, I thought). I asked her for hard examples of his bad behavior. Just before she sent me examples he convinced me to block her. That day he told me he wanted to marry me someday when things are better.\n\nHe \"helped\" me to close at work to keep tabs on me. That often turned into him getting drunk and having an outburst when we got home. I was so scared and ashamed that our housemate would hear us fighting (more just him yelling). He would only stop when I couldn't take anymore and would burst out crying and he would half apologize. He subtly didn't allow me to see my friends alone because he said he was so lonely and having a hard time recovering. He would lock me in my car with him for hours at a time yelling about how bad the world was and how I wasn't helping enough. Something like not cooking him dinner would send him into a rage about how no one ever takes care of him. I felt like I was going totally insane. But was it all because of the accident? He just needed time to recover. Things would go back to how they were. He was just getting back onto his feet.\n\nWe'd have some really good days again. I thought the \"old\" narc was coming back. He started to be able to pay for some things like meals and drinks again but he got really upset when I talked about him paying me the money back. He had made some new friends to play music with, who happened to be women, and I was proud of him for putting himself out there. He had days when he got really depressed. I signed him up for a therapist and wanted him to see a psychiatrist. He suggested a trip down south to visit his old friends and family and I thought that could be what he needed to get back on track mentally. Plus, I wanted to see where he had lived for a few years. He said we could stay for free in his family's cabin.\n\nOf course, that fell through the day of the trip because his family didn't trust him with the cabin. I had to book a last-minute expensive air bnb because he threw a tantrum about not going but I pointed out we'd only be spending my money. He assured me he'd pay me back once he got on his feet. The trip started off well until we were walking his dog off-leash on a trail and when we turned a corner she ran off. He was sent into a rage, running through the woods screaming like a maniac, telling me I was a horrible person and it was all my fault, and told me he'd never forgive me. *What would people think of him?!* When I finally found the dog (playing with another dog on a farm nearby) he acted like everything was okay. I was shaking and terrified of him and how he had just treated me. But he was excited to go visit a brewery. I couldn't figure out why his old friends didn't want to see him or why even his family seemed reluctant. I knew he'd had problems in the past but he didn't deserve that kind of treatment. He had a very elaborate story about why his friends were acting that way and why he had to leave the area. I noticed almost every cashier at every coffee shop or bar we went to remembered him with a smile.\n\nThings only got worse when we got back from the trip and I started to plan my own trip abroad. I said I needed to do it for my own personal reasons. *He said he should come too. I should pay for him to come too. He can't trust me to not cheat on him over there. It isn't safe for me to be alone.* I knew this behavior was not okay, but he hid it behind fake love and care. I knew in my heart I needed to go on the trip and we needed to break up. I told my friends how bad things *really* were and they supported me leaving him asap. I knew it was sensitive though. I was scared of him. He had told me numerous times that if I would leave him he would kill himself. I knew that was a horrible thing to say - but how do you leave someone after that?\n\nOne evening when we'd had a few drinks he told me his grandfather had sexually assaulted him and that's why he was so messed up. I still don't know if it's true. His mom said it is possible.\n\nAfter a weekend trip visiting old friends in my college town I knew I was finally ready for the breakup. I reconnected with who I once was and knew I'd lost myself. I was hungover from Saturday night and drove two hours straight to my shift at the bar. I was cleaning glasses and turned around when I heard his voice. The minute I looked at him I knew something was off. His eyes were dull. His voice seemed fake. He was like a caricature. I instantly felt cold. He said he was having an amazing day and was so excited to see me. I started getting upset that he showed up unannounced and because he took the bus on a Sunday I would have to take him home and miss my employee party that I was looking forward to. Then his face switched from an ear to ear grin to crying at the bar. I was so embarrassed. I didn't know what to do. I was just trying to work. He confessed to me he had taken mushrooms earlier in the day. But I knew it was more than that. It felt like a manic episode. I was able to get him to go sit in my car and read a book as I finished my shift. His phone was plugged in behind the bar and when I checked the battery on it I saw dozens of texts and Tinder notifications. I wasn't even surprised.\n\nI told my boss I was sick and couldn't make it to the party and drove him home, shaking the whole way. I told my best friend how scared I was and she said she wanted to come get me but I knew it was a delicate situation and also didn't want to leave him alone with my housemate. I felt like he was my burden to bear and if anyone could handle him, it was me. He said he was hungry and he made us dinner and I couldn't touch my food. He asked why I was acting so weird. I went upstairs and got a loan contract I'd been meaning for him to sign and he signed it. I still don't know why he agreed to that. After I got him to go to bed my best friend came over to stay the night. I took his phone when he was sleeping and read all of the gross and explicit messages he had with the many women he was cheating on me with. I also noticed all the strange lies he was telling the women. Like he had 10 different personas. I called his cousin who I'd met on our trip. His cousin said: *Ah, I knew this would happen. This is what he always does. We thought he was better this time. But we all pitied you when you came to visit the family. What lies has he told you? I asked if he was lying to you when I saw him and he said you knew everything. Agh I suppose it was all a lie, wasn't it? How about you tell me things he told you and I'll tell you the truth.*\n\nMy world shattered.\n\nEverything I thought I knew was a half-truth or a blatant lie. The man I thought I loved was dead.\n\n*He wasn't in the Army. He wasn't deployed in Iraq. He didn't graduate college, he dropped out. His ex didn't cheat on him, he cheated on her. He didn't know how to brew beer. He didn't work at so and so place. He didn't know how to paint and knit, his ex did. He wasn't even Jewish. He was raised a conservative Christian, had a weird obsession with Jewish culture, and was conveniently directly related to a high ranking SS officer. He was a drug addict, an alcoholic, and a sex addict. He used to sell cocaine. He had a masturbation addiction. The warrant for his arrest was totally his fault and he tried to lease an apartment with a bad check. He was defaulting on numerous loans. His driver's license had been revoked due to not paying multiple tickets.*\n\nYou can't make this sh\\*t up.\n\nI stayed in the spare bedroom that night. Shaking. I could hear he had woken up and was pacing around the room. Then he started singing and playing the guitar. Then he came into my room. I pretended to be asleep. He stood over me and stared at me. That happened a few times that night.\n\nIn the morning I told his mom and dad they needed to get him and take him to the psych ward. They both said they were busy so when our housemate left for work my friend and I called 911 to say narc was threatening to kill himself. The police were the first to respond. When I told him he needed to be hospitalized he agreed and started writhing around on the floor screaming that he was a monster and wanted to die. I told him to get up off the floor and felt nothing.\n\nThe police came. I was terrified but they were kind to me. He was already acting \"normal\" and joking around with the cops as he was being taken away in handcuffs. He was taken to the psych hospital for a night. But when the police realized there was a warrant for his arrest in another county they took him to the county jail. He was there for 10 days. He tried to call me every day. I talked to him briefly. I could tell he was scared and now that I knew how sick he was I pitied him. I was obsessed to figure out what was wrong with him and why it happened. His mom acted very supportive for those few weeks. She said she knew he was a monster but thought he was better and that he was telling me the truth. She set him up with a Christian rehab program for a month after his release. In reality, I think she just didn't want to deal with him.\n\nI should've gone no contact but I couldn't bring myself to believe that he was heartless after all of that trauma. I thought he had BPD or severe bipolar and could recover. I hoped that there was a part of him that was real and that I loved. We had hours of crying conversations about why he was so messed up and how he was going to get better and never hurt people again.\n\nThen I left for my trip. He continued to contact me for strange reasons. He would ask weird things like, *am I attractive?* I just wanted to know he was safe and that he would pay my money back. I didn't want to talk to him. He came out of rehab a \"changed man\" and was hyper-religious. I told him religion was fine but actual recovery would take a lot of hard work, not just God. He sent me love letters about how he was going to get better for me. I thought it was creepy but also I was still bonded to him at the time.\n\nThen he told me he was seeing a new girl. I said that's fine but you have to treat her well. Then I felt very protective of this girl and I impulsively texted her and tried to warn her (which never works). He became furious. And so came the discard phase.\n\n*I was a stupid, horrible, lying, crazy bitch. How dare I ask about money? I was being so manipulative. How dare I interfere with his life. I don't want him to be happy. Doesn't he deserve to be happy?!*\n\nAnd the real kicker\n\n*I'm just jealous.*\n\nShe got back together with him a few weeks later. I grew more and more desperate about the money and the discard and started to beg him to show me any sort of sympathy or humanity. His mom said she couldn't do anything to help me. All his friends blocked me. He ended up blocking me saying it was for *his own mental health.* I felt so stupid for falling for his games.\n\nThen when I got home from my trip, my dog passed away and he messaged me condolences. I was curious to see how he was *actually doing* (he'd claimed to be a changed man) and I asked to meet up. He said yes. Then canceled. Then I said I'd give some of his stuff back. Then he made time for me. He had to cancel a therapy appointment! I wanted to observe his lies. I was too afraid to call him out, but I could call him out in my mind. We got coffee and he made his life seem wonderful. He was wearing brand new designer clothes. His new girlfriend was \"the one\" and me trying to sabotage them only made them stronger. Nothing had changed. He said he wanted to make a detailed plan to pay me back. Then when I was just about to talk about money he said his girlfriend needed to pick him up and he left in a flurry. I texted his mom to ask if she thought he was doing okay and she said they weren't speaking at the moment because he had stolen her credit card. I called to confront him about it and I said I knew he was lying and he said I was \"freaking him out\". He blocked my number and we haven't talked since.\n\nI may or may not take him to court for the money.\n\nAll of this was just six months of horror.\n\nI still feel so much guilt and shame about the whole situation. A lot of rumination and negative thoughts. My friends know the story but I can't bring myself to tell my family.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Well...more so than usual. \n\nI'm sorry in advance for the rant. I DON'T need advice, just a word in solidarity, someone who's in the same shoes, lost physical custody of their kids, wanting to just stop trying to be involved because it never ends well. My mental has about had all it can take. \n\nMy people, my 2 favorite people in the world, don't know I'm struggling so bad. And, let's face it, they've heard much of it over and over, just in different ways. I don't give them the choice to deal or hear it anymore. I've just stopped telling them when I'm on the struggle bus.\n\nNow, onto the whole clusterfuck of fuck that is my mind. Because fuck this. The story: \n\nMy youngest (4) daughter told me (when I had them for 2 weeks) that their other family is always upset and mad at her. My youngest said she gets spanked a lot. My oldest (6) backed it up, but said she (6) doesn't get in trouble that much, but does get spanked. I prodded  because this 4 year old has a butt load of mental health issues that arent being addressed by her father and she shouldn't feel like she cant do anything right, her words and always getting into trouble because of it. It makes them sad when they get spanked and it hurts them. Que phone call night, youngest is crying and was told she can only say good night and I love you to me because she got in trouble. Youngest was still upset and kept trying to tell me the one thing about her day. I asked her about getting in trouble and what happened and \"made her relive it (fathers words).\" I talked her through it and challenged her to think of ways to do better, to not lie, and we can talk more about it the next time we talk. I, in an incredibly non-accusatory way, said I didnt agree with them spanking our children directly to the father and \"mom\" later that night. But, no they weren't going to stop spanking, \"it's a tap on their most padded part,\" I need to stop what I'm doing, just back them up because I live too far away, don't know anything except what little kids have told me, etc., etc., etc. \n\nIf I wasn't a Narcissist, why else would they tell everyone and their mother that I am? Why else would the court deem me dramatic, hateful, vengeful (I wasn't btw. My lawyer believed I should have defended myself *more* against his lawyer in court)? Why else would the judge rule in his favor, if I wasn't the problem party? Why else would they deny my children the ability to speak of me in their own home? Why else would they believe I have no empathy or ability to love (I have heaps and work with families in community based rehabilitation and absolutely love helping people)? Why else would they be so hostile? Why else would they deny me information about my own children, except for what the girls tell me during our phone calls that, honestly I can never predict when or how often will occur? Why the fuck would they claim I coach the girls (what would I even coach them on?!)?? Why in the world would he constantly say that I accuse him of being a monster? Why else would he tell me who I am and all my shortcomings when I try to bring up concerns about our children? If I'm not the Narcissist in this story, why in the world would do I constantly look for ways to *not* be? \n\nMy abuser, and yes, fuck yes, he was abusive. He was abusive emotionally, mentally, sexually. I am *so* tired of hearing that I play the victim and that he's some god damn gift to Earth and the  perfect father (fucking barf). But not abusive. He's the kindest person and has never raised his voice. /s \n\nAbuse is not always yelling, there never was. There were holes in walls though, there was erratic driving, he clenched his fists and jaw, grinding his teeth when he was furious with me. There were threats to beat the shit out of people that had wronged him, some random person that cut him off; he followed those people occasionally, tailgating them, wishing death on them and talks of running them off the road. He often talked about getting back at people that he perceived to have slighted him. It was always \"beating the shit\" out of someone, or killing them. \n\nHe belittled me about a week ago, twice, \"we can find articles on the internet as well,\" and \"your penchant for combing the internet for sources.\" But of course! Both he and the new mom determined there was no belittling involved. Except!! He used to say things like that all the time and top it off with a snide remark about me only parenting according to fads and the latest blog posts. No. I have a fucking Bachelors in Psychology and read peer reviewed articles and shit from PROFESSIONALS. I research and read to the end of the Earth because I like to be informed. He used to belittle my choice in degree too... and wasn't quiet about the fact that he didn't believe it was a real science. \"Psychology is a joke\"; \"psychiatry is a joke\". It killed me in court when he couldn't even remember what my degrees were in. \n\n\n....this is so much longer than I intended. I'm not going to apologize though. I refuse to apologize for telling a story of how my ex was abusive and still is.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

You can choose to read my story of subtle, not so subtle abuse or not. I need to tell someone the full story, so here I am. \n\nThis is a long one, I mean we were together for 8.5 years, knew each other for 10. How could it not be long? By the end, he was unemotional, unsupportive, emotionally neglectful, and he had trained me to stop bringing up grievances and asking for help through guilt, shame, manipulation, gas lighting. I probably missed something in there, everything starts running together when life is on repeat for almost a decade. Let me start from the beginning: \n\nWe started dating in college, an LDR. Before we even began dating, he would get upset with me when I drank without him, if I drank with my male friends, if I hung out in a group with ANY male, he'd accuse me of playing him when I made it clear multiple times I wanted no relationship with him because we lived 2.5 hours apart. And he persisted. For months. I gave in after 3. I slowly stopped hanging out with and eventually would stop speaking to all my male friends. I lost a lot of friendships. I eventually moved out of the apartment I shared with my best friend and stopped being friends with her. I drove her away. He didn't like her and wasn't shy about it. He would shame me for being friends with her, \"how can you be friends with a slut,\" \"you can't be friends with her and not be a slut too.\" There were other things he said, but it's been so long. \n\nI wanted to protect her from him, myself too. I did anything to avoid making him angry. He liked to use his fists when he was angry, but he never once touched me, till almost a decade later. Only the walls around me. I cant remember a whole lot during certain time periods, just generalized, feelings I guess. I was terrified of him. I remember 2 specific instances he punched a wall. Though, I'm fairly certain there are other instances in which he punched things around me because I had made him mad in some way. I remember the first time it happened it was the Summer after we started dating. He asked me if I was afraid of him. I lied and told him no. \n\nI was constantly accused of cheating and lying. I spoke to a guy friend off and on through out the years. He had been a really close friend in high school and we stayed in contact through social media. Though, it was always really strange, he would randomly, and often become unfriended along with all my other male social media friends. I chalked it up to shitty programming and re- add them. He eventually became another guy that I had alledgedly cheated on my abuser with and another person I had to lie about when I spoke to, or hung out with. Little did I know that my abuser was keeping tabs on my phone. My phone was constantly checked, my social media, my emails, my computer. I always questioned how he knew things that I had never told him. How he knew I had spoken to that old friend, asked how he was doing, where he was living nowadays. I eventually found out that my abuser would mass delete all male friends on my social media and male contacts in my phone. \n\nJealousy is such a nasty thing... to protect any guy I had ever slept with, I lied about who they were and lied about not remembering names of my high school sexcapades. I'm 18 at the time and had just moved back home and closer to my abuser, home for the summer. He had taken me out to the local lake and wouldn't take me home until I told him every last name of every guy I slept with so he could find them, beat the shit out of them, or kill them. I believed him. So, I lied. \n\nI lied a lot to my abuser.", "subreddit": "abuse"}
{"post_id": "d0dwh9", "created_utc": 1567758806, "title": "Guide to post-No Contact", "author": "TheLivingMed", "self_text": "Hiya.\n\nGoing NC is great, and takes a lot of guts.\n\nBut going through NC weeks down the line wasn't easy either, and I went through several phases to get to where I am now, especially when it came to *how I view myself as a person*.\n\nI thought I would share my reflections with you; whether you've gone NC or are contemplating it, these detailed reflections may help you get insight into your own negative feelings, especially deeply internalized ones. They may also help you find some proper coping techniques to make the ride easier, but also to understand that you are not alone in this particular suffering.\n\nBe prepared. This is lengthy.\n\n*The actual blocking*: In a year and a half I had gained nothing and lost so much. I realized that I had lost myself as a person, my pride and my identity; I used to be a strong, almost intimidating person given my immense confidence, and yet I had become self-hating, depressed and dissociated. And all the things that initially kept me in the relationship, i.e. the sex, the validation from his compliments, meant nothing anymore. I was starved for his trickles of validation amidst the oceans of spiteful comments. He made me hate myself and the sex had gotten horrible (he had even stopped kissing me), so it was a simple matter of cons outweighing the pros. And this is how you should think about it.  Why do you stay with him anymore? Is it worth it?\n\nThe seconds before the block, I felt physically and emotionally horrible; and this made me realize that what I had with him wasn't a relationship - it was an ADDICTION. And so I treated it as such. I blocked him, I felt a huge sense of relief, and I spent the next few days going through actual withdrawal. I didn't lie to myself - I was as honest as possible about the fact that I missed him, that I missed our chemistry, that I wanted him to hold me. That I wished he truly loved me. I just let those feelings wash over me for as many days as I needed. And then, they went away. For some they may stay for longer. But those acute feelings do go away and you will feel better and proud.\n\nAlso, revel in the fact this monster who held you in the palm of his hand, who controlled you, made you weak and manipulated you like a toy will suffer from your sudden rejection.\n\n*A few weeks after*\n\nI avoided everything about him, I blocked him off of everything, and never went to places he went to work (we are in the same program). I didn't consider it running away, I just thought of it as me avoiding where my drug would be available. You have to acknowledge that you now have a circuit in your brain which has constantly associated your abuser with that toxic mix of adrenaline and endorphins, and so your job is to now de-condition yourself. Anytime he pops up, don't try to block the memory, but remember in conjunction a time he made you feel horrible, or where he did  something gross and monstrous and pathetic which you swept under the table to preserve his image in your mind. As for thinking about him in a sexual way, do the same thing. Think about him in that way, but remember immediately after that the things that he did that were MAJOR turn offs. And try finding new things to arouse you sexually - books, movies, etc... Your brain needs to be convinced that it can find other healthier ways to supply those endorphins to you.\n\n*A couple of months after*\n\nThis is where I started to work on myself again. Some might argue I should have done that sooner, but it was tough getting back on my feet. I had felt at this point that the \"addiction\" component had abated and I was no longer in constant need of his presence. This is the phase where I started to relate all the ways I felt about myself to things he had done to me. For instance:\n\n**Do you feel empty and devoid of a personality? Do you feel dissociated and the things that made you YOU, are no longer valid?**\n\nTo understand why that happened, you have to understand your abuse. Think about it - You've spent months and years with someone you love who was abusing you, scaring you, intimidating you and making you feel horrible and unsafe - so your cortisol levels are constantly elevated as your body and brain, even if unbeknownst to you, are detecting a major threat. But what is it exactly that your abuser targets? It's your hobbies, the way you talk, the way you act, the things you say. In essence, since your abuser directs his threats at YOUR ENTIRE CORE as a person, and your brain realizes this is the major cause why you're being made to feel unsafe, then what will it do? Just like a mouse being chased by a predator, your brain will put you into hiding to preserve you. You feel empty because your brain has been so used to hiding you from your predator that it's currently stuck in that mode. It doesn't understand that the threat is no longer there. Understanding this, telling yourself that you're safe now, that the threat is gone and that you can act as you will without ANY abuse is what will coax your psyche out of hiding.\n\nAlso, to remember the good things about your personality, remember that the way your abuser made you feel at the beginning during the love bombing phase - the way he made you feel amazing, and attractive, and smart and interesting - those things ARE STILL TRUE. Love bombing is the abusers way of taking qualities that you already have and are already proud of and throwing them back at you. And narcs are hella picky and self entitled, so those qualities must actually mean something if someone as elitist as a narc valued them. Some might say that these are even qualities that the abuser WANTS and is ENVIOUS of, and the following abusive stage is him making you feel like shit about the good qualities that he wished he had but are unattainable to him, for which he has no other resort but to destroy you. Have you never seen someone insecure bash someone they're envious of FOR something they're envious of? Same thing. Therefore, it wasn't the abuser that enabled the love bombing... it was YOU. You felt amazing, and deserve all of those compliments, not because someone handed them to you, but because you had those features from the start. Remember the amazing things about yourself (that you felt during love bombing), write them down, read them out loud, over and over till you understand that these WHO YOU ARE.\n\n**Do you you hate yourself?**\n\nYou have to understand, this is ALL from your abuser. You might not make the connection at first because narcs are amazing at making you feel as if you are wrong, even for small subtle things. Even if it wasn't something he ever directly commented on, just him generally making you feel like shit about yourself will make you start to create new flaws in yourself because of your general state of mind.\n\nYou have to start internalizing the fact that the self hatred wasn't there before him. And even if there are things you are self conscious about, remember that EVERYONE has flaws and insecurities and they are not a mark of how confident you should be, and they are always ways that you can constructively work on your flaws while also being forgiving of yourself.\n\n**Do you feel dissociated?**\n\nDissociation is greatly rooted in stress.\n\nThe fact that your brain was in a high stress state (elevated cortisol, yada yada) means that you were constantly in a state of fight or flight, which IS a state of dissociation (which you will know if you've ever been in a life or death situation). Couple this with the fact that you probably had depressive symptoms, also implicated in dissociation, as well as the fact that your abuser has a warped sense of reality which he tries to impose upon you through gaslighting, means that your grounding to reality isn't as solid.\n\nWith him gone, and you being aware of all of these factors, you feeling safe will decrease all of those feelings markedly.\n\n*Where I am now*\n\n4 months later, and I feel so much better. I feel a lot more confident (baddass music helps btw). Things that I thought I hated about myself, I've forgiven myself for (for instance my laziness and unproductivity at work) and I realize how much of it was attributed to my abuse. I am feeling better about myself. I still occasionally run into my narc since we're in the same program, but I ignore him and it drives him insane and I love it :) He means so much less to me now and I've taken the center stage of my life again. I still think about him, but it's natural and I go on with my life.\n\nI realize that every person will have NC experiences tailored to their own lives, but I'm hoping that reading this will give you some practical strategies to help you during this phase. You will become stronger after this, YOU CAN DO IT GODDAMIT.\n\nPeace out.\n\n\\- Thelivingmed", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I was in the bath with my brother, who is 2 years older than me. My mother had left the bathroom for something, so it was just us.\n\nMy brother was a total asshole as a child. He was a selfish, mean, and cruel little shithead. He tormented me from birth right up until early adulthood. He knew how to intimidate me and he knew that I was too passive and weak to stand up to him. I was terrified of him and knew that he would hurt me if I didn't do what he said to.\n\nAnyway, while we were alone he told me that I have to suck his dick. He used that tone that he always used when he wanted me to do something that he knew I didn't want to do. I knew he was telling me, he wasn't asking or requesting. He said what he wanted and I had to comply or he'd hurt me.\n\nSo I lowered myself down, opened my mouth, and did as I was told. It was awful and I could barely stand it. Then he started peeing in my mouth and burst out laughing. That was clearly his plan all along and I started crying as I threw up all over him. I was humiliated and felt disgusting. I still feel like that when I think about it and I've never stopped hating myself.\n\nOur mother thought nothing of it. Just kids being kids. My brother was never disciplined, I was never helped. Nothing of the sort ever happened again.\n\nRecently, I've been having feelings for my brother (check my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cz0tp8/i_24f_really_love_my_brother_26m_is_that_wrong/) for that story) and the responses to that made me realise that this incident was not kids being kids. I always knew that I didn't like what he did, I knew it was wrong, but I've never seen him as an abuser.\n\nDoes something like this count as abuse? It's a shit way to treat your siblings, sure, but was I actually abused? It was a few seconds and it was only one time. And what am I supposed to do now? I don't want to go back into therapy. My brother is a good person now, do I bring this up and cause a huge rift in the family? I know he has depression and knowing that he's hurt me in such a fundamental and long-lasting way would just be too much for him. We have a good relationship now, if I bring this up I feel like I'll ruin that.

I was involved with a narcissist for two months from June to August this summer. After he love bombed me and had me hooked, and then tested me by seeing if I\u2019d do his laundry and clean his garage under the pretense of it all being for the good of his music business, he told me he wants seven queens. And the sex was D/s so he would be in charge, dominate me, and I would submit to him. He was 36 (I\u2019m 23) and it turned out he already had several other girls involved age 24-25 (and then he also added a 20 year old). I don\u2019t wanna write a novel but he was super manipulative and gaslit (gaslighted?) me a lot. I talked to one of the other \u201cqueens\u201d about it and she felt the same way but couldn\u2019t get herself to leave him. I felt like I had an addiction to him, and finally I left once my friends got concerned, after I\u2019d tried to leave twice before and had gone crawling back. I was acting like a junkie and lying to my friends and neglecting the things that are important to me. I moved out of my home to avoid him and in with a friend. The good news is, I am now 35 days no contact! The bad news is, I can\u2019t stop Facebook stalking him and his queens. And I hate myself for this but I insult the other queens in my head. I don\u2019t like that they\u2019re staying with him, because it makes me feel like I was actually the crazy one.

My university offers counseling that's covered by my tuition. I've never been in therapy before so I started last year and did it for 1 and 1/2 semesters. This year I come back and call them up again. \n\nThis summer was the worst I've felt in years. I had just been left by an assusive, narcissistic boyfriend at the end of the school year. He stripped me off every shred of self-esteem I had managed to scrounge up, completely isolated me from all my friends, and purposefully degraded me until there was nothing left and made me believe it was for my own good.\n\nSo I come back to therapy worse than I've ever been. I have a new therapist because the one I had last year left. They do surveys at the beginning and end of each semester. So my new therapist brings it up and I can see the first intake: red across the board, the second: much better, and the third(most recent): I max out the distress index on two categories and the rest are BAD.\n\nBeginning of the second session and she's asking me for my history. I give the SparkNotes because I've gone over this before, and she told me to keep it short. Parents: Assholes, Siblings: Abusive, Past Relationships: General abuse with some sexual assault sprinkled in, Friends: Past three categories have done their damnedest to make sure I don't have any but I have a few that I've been explaining what happened to last year with my most recent disaster of a relationship.\n\nShe cuts in with a bombshell. I haven't made any progress with therapy with coping with my family as I'm obviously still hung up on them. She gets this from asking about my history and me telling her honestly. She prompted me to talk about it when I really wanted to talk about last year.\n\nSo she tells me I need to go to group therapy and we can meet again after. I really didn't have a choice about this she just pressured me into agreeing to go. So now I'm going to group depression therapy on Monday. I'm going to go to the first meeting. If I don't like it at this point I'm calling the counseling center and canceling all my other stuff. I don't really want to go back.\n\nI also put that I have a really poor relationship with food. I have TERRIBLE seft-esteem(see earlier bit about ex) and as a result, I feel terrible when I eat anything even if I'm shaking with hunger. My weight is a point that every man I've ever had in my life(I'm including father and two brothers) has picked at and commented on since I was a child. Yes, my father did tell his 12-year-old daughter that she'd look better if she lost some weight, if anyone is wondering, Max 180 pounds 5\" 4' and constant soccer, swimming, and manual labor(I lived on a small farm in the middle of the woods).\n\nSo anyway she picked that apart. I got distressed rather quickly and because of this couldn't give her concrete examples and the body language I got from that was she thought I was lying about it. One of the questions was \"Have you ever purged, fasted, or excessively exercised to control weight\". She saw that I had checked it off and demanded to know the last time I purged. I have never purged, I checked it for the last two options. She seemed skeptical and unchecked the box.\n\nSo yeah, I really don't want to go back.

Like no one else can see it, but this guy is fake as fuck and has a way about him that makes people open up to him early and they all love him.  He interjects himself into your conversations and he can do so because he has the ability to do so, and the other people welcome it instead of being like \"what is this guy doing?\" but you realize what is actually happening.  So he basically crushes your conversations, steals your friends, and takes your clients.  He is playing the slow game.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

This lead to one dog killing the other and me literally trying to pry the dogs appart and risking my own life and limb was not good enough because my actions killed her money maker. Yes I'm pretty sure she was another narcissist. But that's a whole other can of worms. The guy I was working with there was staying with a friend of his (for free) and she said I could move into his upstairs apartment in there house if it was okay with him. I agreed to give her rent money as well. \n\nFor context I've recently been reviewing my past serious relationships and this one was one I wasn't sure about him being a narcissist but considered it a possibility. All my past serious relationships have been with vunerable narcissists which I credit my postion as the rescuer in my alcoholic family system. So in other words I'm a disfunctional mess. \n\nSo I reached out hoping he had got his shit together as I had gotten mine and maybe all the insane shit that he did to me was just a repercussion of said shit and we could be friends. \n\nSo I pour my heart out to him apologizing for all the shit I did because I was no angel myself. However I might be wrong in blaming myself. A lot of my behavior was a reaction to his (distancing myself, lying to avoid his rage, etc.) so maybe I'm not the shitty person I made myself out to be. \n\nMy anticipation was him apologizing for his end of the shit and us being adults and talking shit out.

The main reason my situation is so dire is due to the abuse I have been getting from my parents, and I don\u2019t have enough money to move out of the house.

Then he made a comment about the half a bag of garbage I had been collecting as I went. \"where am I suppose to put that? What am I going to do with it.\" I said some rude remark about boohoo he had to throw out garbage while I pack and move by myself. Well that was the door he was looking for. He tore me down, called me names, said I was the narcissist, the hypocrite. I left. Stopped what I was doing and left. Said I'd come back with my mother tomorrow as planned so he'd have to be sweet as pie.\n\nThen he gave me a gift I will never forget.

It's awful.", "author": "bluedahlia82", "self_text": "I'm not too sure where to start...my childhood has not been easy. My parents did not have a very loving relationship, when I was five we moved abroad for some time all together, at first at a squatters house, and then in a little town. After a few years of my dad not being able to maintain a job, my mom decided to divorce him and return to our home country. \n\nI hardly have memories of my life before returning home - by then I was 8 and a half. All memories I have with my dad are either blurry or negative. I remember him shouting and calling my mom an idiot, him spanking me, his smell of cigarettes and alcohol, or him blaming me of things I didn't do or had no control over - like once that my baby brother fell on his head he accused me of trying to kill him, or purposely breaking my glasses. Also, during the time we were squatting, I was abused by someone who was supposed to be looking after us. That I can remember, as well as other episodes of abuse that happened later on in my life.\n\nHowever, I remember when that happened, I had already experienced that, it wasn't a foreign sensation. I remember disassociating and keeping still, knowing it would pass. I was also a compulsive masturbator before then, and I knew things. I remember wanting to wear sexy lingerie, or understanding what sex was about, but the idea was completely separate from reproduction.\nI also during all those years, especially during a certain time, I'd pee in my bed almost every night, as if that would give me a sense of security.\n\nIt all ended when we returned home, but I've always felt uneasy around my dad. He didn't come visit us since except for one time and I remember it like a really traumatizing experience, as my grandma didn't tell me he had come and presented him as a surprise. I remember wanting to avoid his calls all the time, and vomiting after going to his mothers house to visit. Many years later i started seeing him more often, and I tried to improve my bond, but it all goes back to a mix of fear and repulsion when it comes to him. I also many times have sexual dreams about him, and in the dream it's always confusing if our relationship is a secret, and I've always felt he treated me as if I was his wife. I don't feel safe when I'm staying at his house, all my senses are in alert not to wake him up, or play asleep if I hear him move. I avoid him constantly. I hate the sight of his mouth, or seeing him in his underwear. It feels like an ogre.\n\nI don't know what to think of all of this, like I feel something happened, but I can't place my finger, and at the same time I can't put the blame on something so serious. Yet even if not sexually, he was abusive of me, and I need to make peace with that, as I am still in denial of my own feelings.\nI also have a very bad history of relationships, either abusive or not really serious ones  but witha lot of drama, and I'm struggling to trust men constantly.\n\nDo any others feel like this? You can't put the blame, yet everything points in one direction, or your gut says that, but can't really put an image to  put it to certainty? It frustrates me so much, and I'm really struggling with all of these ideas .", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Last I spoke with him he said,\"I really think we should live together again\" and I said, \"I can only take care of me and my cat\".  He told me he was seriously considering suicide and showed me the letters he had written for the \"off\" date of August 7.  I saw him on August 10th and 11th.  Of course I foolishly gave him more money and texted him the next day, \"That was my last favor and we shall speak no more forever.  Be good to yourself.\"  He wrote back \"understood\".\n\nTwo weeks later, August 30, I received a text from his phone from his Niece.  Before she said anything, other than \"Hi, this is N's niece\" I knew and immediately wrote back, \"Have we lost him?\"  She said, \"I'm sorry, yes.\"  I called her immediately.\n\nSo, he is gone.  I will never have to worry about him trying to insinuate himself into my life.  He couldn't find anyone else to take care of him.

She only withsood it for 6 months after 6 years of marriage.  I withstood it for 9 months after only 1 year.\n\nSo, he took his life.  His letter sent to all of us stated that he believed that everyone had the right to take their own life and it was his time.\n\nHIs niece, his brother, his x wife, no one is particularly sad and all said, \"I expected this to happen one day, he never grew up.  Everything was everyone else's fault.\"\n\nMy brother was with me when I received the word and when we were off the phone he said, \"I know you feel sad, I heard it in your voice, but I can't tell you how happy I am.

I saw titles popping up over and over as recommended reading; got them (on my kindle so he can't see the cover) and wow-these books literally contain direct quotes from our relationship and from my journal. Ugh.\n\n~~I am ready to go~~\\-I'm crawling out of my skin. I'm trying to plan, but I'm struggling with 2 things. Any guidance would be so appreciated.\n\n1. I still feel crazy. I feel like... is there some way that like even though he checks the boxes for an emotional abuser, and I definitely check the boxes as someone traumatized by it,-Can it somehow be that I really am too sensitive/emotional/selfish/insecure/etc? Like  maybe he is meaner than some people but I also took it too personally?-If he is kind of controlling (feel like he acts like my dad) but only covertly and doesn't forbid me from doing things, am I making a big deal out of nothing?-He is never jealous or possessive. I mean he was early in the relationship in a very over-the-top-monitor-my-phone kind of way, but hasn't been that way, even a tiny little normal amount, in years. Like he couldn't care less. So can it really be all that problematic if he's not possessive/jealous?\n2. Even if I'm crazy, I'm still ending this and want some practical advice. We live together. Most of the stuff is mine or is in my name, so I think he should leave. But I'm afraid he won't. I can't picture him agreeing to do that. I told a close friend all of this, and she said that I could come stay with her (and that I could even bring my cat, because he used to be mean to the cat) and she said she and her partner have discussed this multiple times. Multiple times, before I even asked... and then she started going over a plan with me about telling several people when I'm going to have the breakup conversation and having my phone/keys in my hand when I do it and offered to be around the corner at the time. She was so ready to have this conversation/plan, it kind of scared me. I asked her was she thinking something bad would happen and she said you just never know.-He's never been physical before, so why all the precautions?-I want to break up without a long conversation and not have to spend time around each other after. Does this mean I should just go?-Should I do it while he's at work?-Anything I'm missing?\n\nP.S. sorry about formatting-i'm not much of a poster.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

He preyed on me, cheated, manipulated me into believing he was as good as it gets and gaslighted me to the point where I have been diagnosed with PTSD. :) \nIt\u2019s been 1 year since we last spoke. \n After basically telling  him to leave me alone and forget I exist the last time we spoke, he cracked a joke about me on twitter. It was \u201charmless\u201d, he was actually saying I was super funny...but he knows our past. He knows who he is to me. He knows he was abusive and said it himself that he dragged me through hell.  One of his friends screenshot it and sent it to me and I blew up publicly. \n\nHe\u2019s gone and cried to people(even some that I know who aren\u2019t aware of the truth) that I\u2019m a bitter and obsessed ex who can\u2019t get over him and is intent on ruining his reputation. My thing is, it took concerted effort to speak about me on a public platform. He hadn\u2019t done that in two years for a reason, why now?\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time I reacted in this public way. The first time I tried to I guess warn girls about him. Once upon a time he aligned himself with feminists and women and that were well respected and trusted and he\u2019d find girls that way. He said he liked the insecure and traumatized ones. He\u2019d become what they liked and fucked with them until they left him alone or he left them. \n\nAnyhow, after I tried to \u201cexpose\u201d him no one cared. I expected some backlash, but I didn\u2019t expect what I got. I didn\u2019t expect people to basically stand in front of him and lock arms. I didn\u2019t expect people to tell me I deserved it, and I didn\u2019t expect almost everyone to call me a liar. \n\nApparently he has a gf who now also believes I\u2019m some liar and stalker ex, as if her bf\u2019s actions and words aren\u2019t being sent to me. As if he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. I\u2019ve got people who weren\u2019t there telling me how my relationship went and how I should deal with his very visible existence. We were long distance the whole time so people think I shouldn\u2019t care much at all lmao or that he couldn\u2019t have been abusive. \n\nToday I wake up to some burner account sending me screenshots of him going on a rant about how cheating on your partner is sick and twisted and you should never do something intentional to hurt them, and yes great I\u2019m so glad he realizes that. But I\u2019m angry. For so long after we broke up, he\u2019d publicly make fun of cheating on me because he knew they\u2019d get back to me. He knew.  I\u2019m sure he\u2019s happy in his relationship and I certainly hope so because that hopefully means I\u2019ll never hear from him again, but I hate the fact that I wake up and hear about people congratulating him on his growth and change and how he\u2019s such a good person when not even a year ago he was terrorizing me and and just a couple of months ago he knew he could unravel me by just mentioning my name and he did that still. \nI know I need to unplug and cut people out of my life who know him. But how do I reconcile the fact that I know him as this scary and evil person and no one else does? How do I deal with people praising him for \u201cgrowing\u201d from being my abuser when I don\u2019t think he has? If he  had grown and genuinely didn\u2019t mean harm by speaking about me, wouldn\u2019t he have known to at least understand why I was so upset in the end? Wouldn\u2019t he have been scared to even mention me by name because of our tumultuous past? How do I remove him from my mind completely?

I\u2019m proud of everything she\u2019s achieved and the woman she has become. \n\nSo the general story is, after I escaped my abusive ex and got out of hospital, I moved away to the place I was born. Around this time, my childhood best friend left an abusive, drug-driven relationship. She spent a year in rehab in a different city, and her abuser disappeared. She has since met her now fianc\u00e9 and had a beautiful little boy. She was never ashamed, and everyone around us knew about her past and being abused, her drug addiction and everything regarding recovery. She\u2019s loud and proud and I\u2019m proud of her too. \n\nHowever, because of the timing, we never talked about the reasons behind me moving back. She didn\u2019t know I was abused, didn\u2019t know I\u2019d been admitted to a psychiatric hospital, didn\u2019t know I\u2019d been stabbed or anything. \n\nShe often mentions things in passing, things that have triggered her anxiety, like passing a shop her abuser frequented, glimpsing his mum in the supermarket etc. I\u2019ve always been very sympathetic, talked her down, done my best to support her. \n\nToday, she mentioned something as simple as a vacuum cleaner brand. That particular brand is one my abusive ex specifically made me buy, and on one occasion he had knocked me out when I hadn\u2019t vacuumed to his approval. I said something along the lines of \u201coh I can\u2019t even look at [brand] it makes me feel funny.\u201d She laughed and asked why, and I told her. \n\nHer initial response was to ask if it was a one off. I said no. She hasn\u2019t replied, it\u2019s been hours. \n\nI know I\u2019ve probably upset her, but any discussion of abuse has always been centred around her experiences.

And he never looks me in the eye. \n\nIf that were the case, I would be a lot more accommodating of his temper. We could find tools for both of us to work around it. But when I suggested that maybe he be evaluated, he got defensive and angry. I got angry at him for getting angry and saying I was being a jerk for saying that. \n\nI know that my own anger is unhealthy. But for so many years I put up with so much cruelty and disrespect from various partners, and would just cry and feel sad and helpless. But now I have self-respect and refuse to be treated that way. I won\u2019t put up with abuse and bullshit, so I get angry because I feel it helps me reclaim my power. \n\nBut this shit is not working. \n\nMy partner is really great at learning and growing. With a lot of time and patience and coaching on my part, he went from a sexist and casual racist to a true intersectional feminist. So I have faith that he can get this temper under wraps. But I don\u2019t have the tools for that. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to fix him or myself. Honestly I\u2019m sick of being the one who always has to fix things, but I feel like if we can get through this last obstacle, it will make all the difference. \n\nI don\u2019t have insurance, so therapy is kind of out right now. Does anybody have any book suggestions or suggestions otherwise to help us with our issues? \n\nThank you.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I was hospitalized for the second time this summer after the breakdown of a code pendant, super complicated romantic relationship/friendship of 1 1/2 years, finding out I didn\u2019t get a job I really wanted, and stopping my medication. I had the darkest time I\u2019ve ever had in the week before the hospital, with intense suicidality, heavy substance use and risky sexual behaviour that led to a major STD scare. Trying to figure out how to pick up the pieces of my life after such a dramatic breakdown feels daunting and also embarrassing.\n\nWhile in the hospital this time I was diagnosed with complex PTSD (I already had a ptsd diagnosis, but most of my past mental health care has been related to having bipolar and severe anxiety) and spent a lot of time in groups related to trauma. I identified the re-creation of abusive dynamics from the main source of my trauma in almost all of my (very similar) codependent and emotionally abusive relationships, and have been referred to lots of great outpatient programs to work through stuff. I\u2019m really motivated to work on trauma stuff and want to be able to have healthy relationships. I just graduated university, and the main relationship in my life ended that resulted in me losing connections with lots of other friends. Despite support from my family in focusing on my health and only working part time, I feel so, so lost.\n\nMore than anything, I just feel so angry that I\u2019m in this place, and that it feels like trauma that I couldn\u2019t control has wreaked havoc on my life. Is there anything that you tell yourself or ways that you\u2019ve been able to handle the anger at your abuser(s)?

I guess that alone can make a person go batty when they start to question if what they saw was real or not. \nOur relationship is crazy. When I confront him about any given thing he interrupts midway and starts yelling and turns it back on me and about the littlest thing I may have done years ago.

i never said its for certain. the only thing i know thats wrong with me is tinnitus at the moment, but i show signs of certain things i won't go to detail in here. but according to my sister (who doesn't live with us) my mother herself said she thought i might have ADHD/ADD when i was having trouble in school, but never told me or got me tested. on the topic of health, i haven't seen a normal doctor or dentist in YEARS. the last time i remember going to a doctor was for a shot before my first year of high school, but that wasn't a check up and it was required by the state so i don't know if that counts. my mother says we can't afford it, but my parents have bought old original cars and really good concert tickets(which again, i'm extremely thankful for, but i don't get why we can do this but not a checkup?). she hasn't tried getting any medical financial help for me.\n\ni've been threatened with getting kicked out or sent away at least 6 times, for fights i can't even remember the reason of, having a messy room, forgetting something, and several times when i was struggling in school(being extremely behind). this never happened but i've had anxiety attacks over it every time.\n\nshe's mocked me for having panic attacks over these threats, being scared of her, wanting help, thinking i might be ill (she knows about these because i had told my sister, and for some reason she told my mother. no idea why). any time i cry during our fights she gets more angry, and also mocks me for this. i honestly don't remmeber every reason for every fight we've had, but i know some included forgetting things, school, her thinking i had an attitude, trying to defend myself (talking back, she calls it) she uses all of this against me during fights.\n\nshe hasn't gotten physical (i had the classic getting spanked/smacked in the face, hit with belts or spoons when i was in grade school, i cannot remember more then this), but she's made threats during our arguments on how she's going to knock my teeth out, or when i was crying too hard to breathe, she told me to choke. she would sometimes make advances towards me or raise her arms, and if she saw me flinch or back up she'd mock me for this.\n\nif we had an argument in public and i showed i was upset or nervous, she'd loudly say shit like \"you act like i beat you\". if i didn't show any emotion she'd get mad and tell me to stop looking so mad.\n\nboth she and her boyfriend tend to blame her stress out on me. my mother texts me after fights with things such as \"do you just do this to upset me?\" or telling me im going to give her a stroke. something that stuck with me, was when her boyfriend seriously told me, when i was in probably middle school, that she's probably stressed out about me considering myself an atheist, because she's a christian and both of her kids (my older sister) are atheist. i remember that hurting so hard and i felt horrible.\n\nher boyfriend rarely if ever defends me. he only told me she was overreacting once in secret, never in front of her. but lately he's been more on her side.\n\nthere's alot more i could say, but this post is long enough (sorry) and im starting to tear up and shake writing this, or hell i might be forgetting something.\n\nfor the record, i'm again extremely grateful for everything nice they've ever done to me. because of the nice things they've done, this just makes me feel absolutely horrible and selfish for being upset over everything i've listed. i really never mean to start any fights with them, and i absolutely hate feeling like all i do is upset them and be a burden towards them. i try to help as much as i can, and we can be really happy at times!

After reading through all of these past posts I\u2019ve been left with my jaw hung wide open with how similar everyone\u2019s experience is here. So here is what I believe is my discard story. My nex started by telling me that first he wanted me to move out of the house because he wanted us to start over and start dating again. I was so blown back by this, I couldn\u2019t believe it. I told him if I was leaving, I was leaving for good because I do not do breaks and that\u2019s when he made me move my things into the extra bedroom in the house but would harass me to sleep with him every night and we would act like a couple. This was absolutely horrible for me, I would cry every night and it was driving me crazy as every night he would remind me that he just fell out of love with me but that he really wanted to help me as much as he could. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and packed my bags and left. This caused an entire wave of horrible things to happen. We had a vacation planned at the end of the month and originally we were suppose to go together as friends and be cordial but to be honest this was a horrible idea. He ended up using that hanging it over my head telling me he would cancel the whole trip (I\u2019ve decided I can go alone and will go alone if I need to). Last night I decided to go out with my best friend and an hour into the night I\u2019m getting drunk messages from him telling me to pleas pick him up that he\u2019s drunk and he lost his cousin and that he\u2019s scared and passing out and blacking out in a club. I tried calling his cousin and his phone was dead, I ended up leaving to find him laid out on the concrete floor in our downtown surrounded by vomit. It took me two hours and four strangers help to get him up and walking close enough to a street where a car could pick us up. When I got back to the house he begged me to stay over and I did and this was a huge mistake as it was four hours of constant begging for sex and every time I would say no he would accuse me of having sex with someone else. He even offered to get me pregnant so that we could work everything out. He started saying he doesn\u2019t even know why he tries. There was a point where he put his hands around my neck and told me not to make any noises or else and I couldn\u2019t do it anymore I kept crying because the torture was too much. He woke up so angry at me and would not let me leave the house and threatened to get me arrested, threatened to hurt me more than he ever had. Threatened that if his roommate came up to the room to check on us he would punch me square in the face. I managed to run out of the house after using the SOS button on my phone which makes a loud noise when you press it. After he sobered up he was telling me that I was stupid for helping him and that that\u2019s what I get for always doing favors for  people and that he wasn\u2019t listening to me anymore and that this was all my fault and all he was trying to do was go to work. It was a real roller coaster of emotions for me as this man is abusive emotionally and physically and I honestly feel extremely crazy, drained and thought about checking myself into a hospital because the abuse and the mind games have been so over bearing. I\u2019m so sorry that this is so long. I ended up cutting his cellphone service and WiFi service and I have decided to never talk to this man again in my life.

want to say my ex is/ was narcissistic because there are some traits that he didn't display. like absolute rage.  but i think this \"rage\" came out in other forms. he was very passive aggressive. for example, every time he would see another woman with a body shape similar to mine, he would scrunch up his face and say how disgusting he thought they were. or he would say stuff like \"oh those girls are totally checking me out\" (literally about any girl that looked in his direction). another thing he would do was when i got dressed up all nice, he would always wait ages to compliment me (or until i asked him what he thought about my outfit) or he would go \"its nice but...\". he also liked to switch between shit-talking his ex's or talking about how he still loved them in some way. he also liked talking to his ex's a lot. also he would usually lose interest in me whenever any other girl would start showing him attention and hint the idea to ME that he was developing feelings towards them. oh and whenever we were driving in his car together, he always seemed to play \"break up\" songs.\n\nhe showed very little to not interest in the things that i liked and would even say \"i don't understand why you like this stuff, its boring/ waste of money etc\". every time i told him i got a good grade in my uni work, he would dismiss it very quickly. sometimes he would congratulate me but it sounded like he was saying it through gritted teeth. every time i would express frustration towards my uni work he would say something along the lines of \"well you should have thought about this before you entered your degree.\" even though all i wanted to do was vent a little bit of my stress to him.\n\nwe broke up twice. first time was after we had a fight, mainly because he did all this shit to me but i would never say anything. i did it because i had very low-self esteem/ self-worth and tended to brush off all those red flags that he displayed. i thought if i gave him enough love, enough attention, enough time that he would eventually grow out of those red flag traits. during the fight, i said some very mean things to him which i regretted instantly. i know there is no excuse for the way i acted but at the time i did it out of pure frustration and resentment because he wasn't seeing what i wanted him to see. whenever we would have conversations about our relationship, he seemed to only talk about how he felt and where he thought it was going and i often found it difficult to fit in what i felt, simply because i was afraid. we didn't speak for months and they were torturous for me. \n\ni went through a very bad self-destructive phase and still i thought about him constantly. i still felt like i had a \"connection\" to him in some way. like i could sense that he still needed my help, love and support. i was very weak. it got to the point where i couldn't take it anymore and contacted him. initially he was very, VERY hostile towards me. and told me everything was my fault, i was horrible, \"you ruined my life\" (even though he was the one sneaking around, talking to other girls behind my back, being passive aggressive towards me) and i apologised profusely for the things that i had said to him in the fight and attempted to take full blame, even though there was something inside of me saying \"this is not entirely your fault\". \n\nafter things reconciled a bit, he revealed to me that he wasn't happy in the current relationship he was in because of the way this new girl was treating him. in hindsight, i know he wasn't telling me the full truth about what was going on between him and her. i have come to realise that he would always tell me half-truths about everything. nothing was ever the complete and honest truth. but at the time i was so emotionally distraught, i thought it was my life mission to help him. he eventually \"broke up\" with her and soon after we were back together and again started the love bombing. \n\nnow i know i sound completely and utterly stupid. and i was. i'm trying not to make excuses with myself but like i've said at the time, i was so emotionally distraught and lost that i thought my only way out was to be with him. but the second time around there was this constant voice in the back of my head telling me something is not right. i always, in someway felt uncomfortable. but during the love bombing, i brushed it aside. eventually the love bombing lessened and the passive aggressiveness started. this time however, i managed to not lose my shit. i always kept quiet and whenever he did something passive aggressive, i would just sit there quiet, or i would just look at him as if to say \"i know what you are doing\" and it made him uncomfortable. the only time i \"stood up\" was where we were talking about names for kids (if we were to have them) and he started bringing up all his previous crushes/ ex's name and i straight up said \"i am not naming any children after your previous crushes/ ex's\" and he become visibly upset and it creeped me out but at the same time, it was like something clicked in my head and the attraction towards him started to lessen quiet a bit after this point.\n\nhe eventually started talking to other girls again and i highly suspect the girl he was dating before me. but this time, i really tried to remain focused on myself. for me this meant focusing on my uni work and going to work. till it got to the point where i straight up didn't want to go to his place anymore. \n\non our last night together, he waited until i slept the night at his place and then literally woke up in the morning and told me that he didn't love me anymore. i had seen this coming for ages but i was still upset anyway. he never gave any reasons and unlike a true narc he didn't \"blame me\" but when he \"cried\" something just didn't seem right about it to me. to me it honestly looked like he was forcing himself to cry. \n\nwhen i initially discovered this reddit, i would read posts and think, oh my god, he totally does this! but he doesn't show all the obvious signs of being a full blown narcissist. sometimes i wonder if he is

Im working. A hour after closing, where the hell am i? Working, we just finished deliveries and im starting paperwork. 2 hrs, literally in the car about to head home, where am i? \"2 damn hours later!?!?!?\". He says its because he need to know where his car is at all times incase i get a ticket (expired inspection for a different state..we switched everything over to this state this week so this inspection sticker should no longer even be relevant unless im wrong?). Tho he already has a GPS (i allowed this in the beginning because my family is also in it and its a safety thing but started to bug me when i learned he has notifications go off Anytime i leave or go somewheres) where he can see where i am at anytime.

Sureeee\". (Wasnt 11 hours. I went and did it at about 4 am. I came back in the room before noon). \nThen sprung it on me \"hope you have the money to foot all the bills for 2 weeks while i switch jobs\". I was shocked. Switch jobs? What? He says nothing happened, but this one pays better (and his job now Loves to cut his hours) so they are looking at his resume.\nMy main concerns: he didnt consult me at all. His hours might be Completely different at this new place. My job is systematically scheduled Around His Hours Now! If he switches hours, it will completely kill my schedule and i may or may not lose Many of my hours. When i spoke of this concern, he said he doesnt know but he needs to wait to find out. Im 99% sure even if this will completely fuck my hours and job, he will absolutely take it. Its just a feeling.

I also didn\u2019t know she can draw. I knew I shouldn\u2019t have delved deeper but she posted the Instagram for her artworks and her game-related twitter. I checked both and I confirmed it was really her. One of her Twitter post was a coffee mug filled with coffee with a post saying \u201cI normally don\u2019t drink coffee...\u201d I was like huh? This person drinks coffee like it\u2019s water. It was at one point one of the things she told me off about. I told her it\u2019s unhealthy to drink coffee at night because she won\u2019t be able to sleep and she\u2019s like \u201cstop mothering me I love coffee!\u201d Now this person is saying \u201cI normally don\u2019t drink coffee.\u201d She would lie about something even as trivial as drinking coffee.

Anyway, my friend has always been manipulative and can be very cruel and abusive, followed by periods of remorse, chasing me relentlessly until I cave and take her back. After she continuously barraged me with abusive texts all day, telling me what a dysfunctional person I am that nobody likes, saying my own family dislikes me and looks down on me (all because I was working and didn't answer her texts), I told her to leave me alone for good (again) and i blocked her number. Last time we didn't talk for 6 months, and she got me back in her life because she told me she might have cancer (She didn't end up having cancer). She was my best friend in high school. I moved away to a big city for many years and moved back to our home town a few years ago and she's made my life a living hell, constantly bullying me, baiting me into arguments and trying to turn people against me. I've tried to distance myself from her but it's been difficult, since she's got her tentacles into every aspect of my life. I've been in therapy the whole time but it's been tough for me since I'm an empath and somewhat codependent -- the perfect mark for a narcissist. I'm still recovering from an abusive marriage when I lived in another state (I'm divorced) and subsequent tangle with another narcissist boyfriend who is now gone. I feel like I have a target on my head and at this point I'm absolutely avoidant of people because I can't seem to identify narcissists until I'm in their clutches. I moved back home to get away from stress and be close to my family, but she's worse than any man I was with. I think I honestly was afraid of her because every time we fight she does something vengeful to punish me and she seemingly has no limits. Yesterday she told me her therapist told her I'm \"toxic\" and to blame for all of her problems (She loves to play the victim) and that was it, I told her I was done and blocked her. I'm sure she's going to trash me to all of our mutual friends and put me on blast on Facebook with everything I ever confided in her about. Who knows what else she will do.\nHow can I get over this? I'm just exhausted from it all and really depressed. I just want to sleep and hide from the world. I haven't dated since narc bf cheated and left me and the hometown \"friend\" just picked up where he left off. I'm just so tired.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I need advice.", "author": "causingcommotions", "self_text": "Hey all. Copied and pasted from my same post in a different group. I\u2019ll try to make it as concise as possible: \n\nI (24F) have found myself in a position where I\u2019ve had to move back in with my parents. I was supposed to move overseas in June of this year but an upset where I lost my job forced me to reevaluate. Unfortunately my lease was expiring and I had nowhere else to go, so my parents offered to let me move back in. They\u2019ve been emotionally abusive in some form or another since I was about 13, and I only realized it once I was out of the house, so needless to say I was upset about having to move back in. \n\nSince moving out the first time I\u2019ve learned to recognize a lot of their toxic patterns and behaviors, which helps, but I\u2019ve been living with them again for about three months now and I\u2019ve reached the end of my rope. Nothing I do is ever good enough. I\u2019m searching for a job, and starting a new part time one I\u2019m actually excited about at the end of this month, but according to them that isn\u2019t enough. I should be working a full time job and paying off debt, regardless of whether I hate the job or not. For context, I also have depression which makes it extremely hard for me to work more than 25/30 hours a week without completely spiraling. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m capable of working full time, but they don\u2019t care. \n\nEverything I do meets with constant criticism. I\u2019m lazy, I\u2019m taking them for granted, if I don\u2019t do work around the house I\u2019m ungrateful, and if I DO help out with chores then I don\u2019t do them right and get met with scorn and a whole lot of passive aggressive bitching. Emotional appeals do NOT work with them: me showing emotion in a discussion/argument results in mocking, dismissal and being told I need to \u201cgrow up.\u201d Basically, they straight up do not care if they hurt my feelings. I can explain myself and my situation as calmly and concisely as possible, and still won\u2019t get listened to. Gaslighting, manipulation, mockery \u2014 you name it, they\u2019ve done it. \n\nI\u2019m currently going to therapy once every two weeks, and this is mostly what my therapist and I discuss. She\u2019s given me plenty of coping mechanisms for dealing with them (distancing myself, walking away when they abuse me, etc), but they either don\u2019t work, only work temporarily, or just cause more problems. Walking away from a conversation means they either follow me and continue it, or else bitch at me later for acting \u201cimmature\u201d and not staying around to let them hurt me. I can recognize their harmful behavior all I want, but it still doesn\u2019t save me from getting hurt and I\u2019m starting to lose the will to fucking live. \n\nI have literally nowhere else to go. I can\u2019t afford rent on my own and other family members aren\u2019t an option. I also have a dog who is my entire life and I refuse to leave her behind. I have friends but they don\u2019t have the means to help me either. I\u2019m in therapy and on meds, but none of it is helping and I\u2019m just spiraling further and further into a really dangerous thought cycle. I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nTL;DR: I\u2019ve had to move back in with my emotionally abusive parents and none of my coping strategies or conflict resolution methods are working. It\u2019s slowly but surely making me suicidal. Any help or advice you can give would mean the absolute world. \ud83d\udc9c", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I never git to have my childhood. She made me miss school to care for them or nurse her from a hangover.\n\nMy mother was married in 04 to a man i thought was my father. He was extremely physically abusive while my mom was more mentally abusive. I grew up violent and scared of everything, with very little confidence. I have such vivid memories of what happened in that house and I thought it was normal. \n\nThat man broke nearly every bone in my body and was scarred my body and mind. Later when I was 13 he raped me. I ended up telling a school counselor and he was removed from the house. My mom sided with him and later testified against me in court.

She said I was ruining my family on purpose and laughed when my siblings cried. She made the rest of my family turn against me except for my aunt who always believed me. \n\nIn November of the same year as the rape, one night was hurting me so I ran out the front door and she locked the door behind me.

Telling me she hopes I choke to death on my best friends \"shit covered cock after he raped me\". Sexualizing my mother and 10 year old niece, going into detail about disgusting acts of incest which she says we commit. We don't. I shouldn't even have to say that, but I feel like I do at this point. It's been pounded into my head so much. \n\nShe draws graphic hardcore pornography, showing men being bound and raped. And yet if I draw a flower that looks too much like vulva, I'm gonna hear about it. \n\nShe stalked my exes and became best friends with them to triangulate. All while calling them horrible names behind their backs. Using anything they said to validate more abuse. \n\nMore death threats to me. \n\nI've snapped a good number of times, I've said things I shouldn't. \n\nOf course, that's just proof that I deserved the way she's treated me. \n\nAnd I still feel sorry for her. \n\nWell, she got kicked out of her apartment recently while I was nc, the night she called me from a fake number 87 times and screamed obscenities for hours on end. So that's my fault apparently. \n\nYesterday she told me she's leaving the state, I'm relieved, but I wished her well. This led to more berating me. Claiming that I'm lying and that I just want to feel like a good person. \n\nI do want to feel like a good person. I'm tired of feeling worthless, and dead inside. I don't even know what my own interests or tastes are anymore. I wasn't allowed to have them. \n\nBut that's not why I told her \"I hope that wherever you go makes you very happy\". I just wish she could be happy. \n\nI see so many posts about revenge here, and I don't get it. There have been times I wanted her to feel how she's made me feel, but it only justifies more of her abuse. \n\nI can't wait for her to leave. I can't wait to be allowed to genuinely feel how I feel, without it being devalued to suit her narrative. \n\nI'm sorry for the long venting rant, but I'm at the end of my rope. \n\nYou know it's messed up when instead of your therapist convincing you that your narc might just be a traumatized and scared person, you're defending the narc while your therapist tells you \"they're a fucking monster\". \n\nAnyways, thanks for listening.

Not proud to have gone down the social media stalking rabbit hole. \n\nSo yesterday...his ex matches with me on tinder. I have reason to believe she knows who I am from social media.

I am in a wonderful relationship with the perfect man who I love so much, but I still got so upset when I saw the message from my ex. I hate that it bothers me so much, to the point where it sent me into a huge panic attack. I felt so trapped because every time I would distance myself from him he knew how to sneak back into my life. We worked together (serving tables), so he would clean my tables for me or bus dishes or would ask to talk to me. He would text and call and when I blocked him, he would download texting apps and continue to beg for forgiveness. He would message me on all social media, even after I blocked him. He would make me feel like I needed him, and that I was crazy/unstable without him. So I always went back. \n\nWhen we broke up for the last time, it was because after I picked him up from a severe car accident where he flipped his truck (drunk, an alcoholic as well as a narcissist,) a friend of ours called him. Repeatedly. I looked through their messages and they were fucking and \u201cin love\u201d. I found this after he was passed out in my bed, very lucky that he did not hurt himself or someone else. And I was stupid enough to save him. This was the third time I had directly caught him cheating on me. \n\nI kicked him out, changed my phone number, blocked him on everything and changed all of my accounts to private. He proceeded to attempt to follow me on Instagram again, message my friends, and our mutual friends at work (we no longer worked together as he was fired at this point and working somewhere else.) He then sent me $250 on Venmo with an extremely long and apologetic paragraph (his favorite manipulative tactic to reel me back in.) He logged in to an old Snapchat after I blocked him to continue to watch my stories. He emailed me once or twice. He told people we worked with to say hello to me for him. It didn\u2019t stop until I called his mom and told her I would get a restraining order if he didn\u2019t stop. I did this because she seems to care more about his custody agreement to see his two children than he does. His custody agreement is temperamental given a passing drug test every two weeks and his ex wife would use any means possible to keep them away from him.

I just want to set this out in the internet so when my memory fails me there is proof this happened. I am suffering from my brother sexual and mental abuse. It all started when I was 8 and he was 9. He would reach into my pants to feel my vagina. I immediately ran to my parents to tell as I had been told in school the no touch zones. They said he is just a boy and didn\u2019t know any better. Nothing happened till I was 10-11 he began playing cops and robber with me. He would tie me up pull my pants down and put his crotch up against my butt and rub. Another time we were at a hotel and I had to share a bed with my three brothers. He pulled my pants down and told me to be quiet. He stuck his big toe into my butt crack. I was scared and already knew It didn\u2019t matter what i said. My parents were in denial. These types of abuse continued tell I was 14. I don\u2019t why he stopped abusing me that way. Instead he would physically abuse me kick me down the stairs, shove me into the drawer, spit on me, and even ran me over with a bike. Most of these my parents had some knowledge about but did nothing so I did nothing fearing if I told the teacher I would be introuble. Eventually when I got older I threw up the red flag and called the police. They sent a dhs worker over who said there was no evidence of abuse. She didn\u2019t ask to have my body checked for bruises she just simply went off of what my parents told her. That was I was lying and was mentally disabled.

They don\u2019t make pills as potent as they used to. After this Dre turned to just verbal and mental abuse. Setting situation up to make them look like i did them, calling me a whore, pig, slut and every slur you can think of. I was dirt and he knew that. He also used my ptsd against me (from an car crash and sexual assaults by group of boys). He would yell, bang on my door when I was sleeping, come in yelling, telling me I deserved it. Laughing when I would have flashbacks. Reaching over when my mom was driving and changing the gear into neutral just to watch me panic and cry. I\u2019m still living in my parents house with him. Nothing has changed. I\u2019m might just try to kill myself. I would leave but my service dog belongs to my parents and without him I can not live by myself.

My nex left me in April after a year and a half of screaming, insults, deliberate neglect, body shaming, gaslighting and finally revealing to me that she never loved me or found me attractive.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNot once did I consider that she could be a narcissist until my psychiatrist told me that's what she was. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSince then I've been trying to work on myself as much as I can, eating better, losing weight, going to the gym, focusing on my music and singing, spending time with friends, all that. Unfortunately it's doing little to quell the feelings of shame and inferiority that come from knowing that person I was so devoted to didn't even love me the whole time, and was using me as an extension of her ego. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLike many narcs, my ex is extremely charismatic. She is practically a saint in everything she does - disability support work, charities, bending over backwards for severely disabled family members, you name it. She goes out if her way to help people in need, and is universally admired for how selfless she is. I suppose she's unlike many narcissists though, in that she doesn't specifically demand praise for it; rather, she simply knows that she is admired by all and is content with that. Her malignant narcissism often manifests when she is criticised, or is asked to apologise for something. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis utterly saintly behaviour played a huge part in my own self-doubt, as it was hard for me to fathom that someone as kind and generous as her could actually be an abuser, even though there was a stark contrast between the way she treated me and the way she treated people she actually cared about - even compete strangers, and she even admitted to:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\na) Knowing full well that she treated me far worse than anyone else she cared about, and\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nb) Knowing that the worse she would treat me, the more I would internalise it and start trying even harder to gain her approval. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOne of many difficulties I'm having here is the lack of support and closure that I'm feeling. \n\nMy family have either told me to move on or are saying I'm an idiot for putting up with her abuse for so long, and my friends are putting on this ridiculous diplomacy act where they \"don't want to take sides\" as \"you clearly just weren't compatible\".\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI saw her at a recent event, and I knew she would be there, and so I was prepared to feel upset, and angry. However I was totally unprepared for the physiological response that my body had. Whenever she was within a few metres of me, or whenever I heard her voice, I began to shake, go into a cold sweat, became dizzy, my heart would start pounding and I felt out of breath.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSeveral of my friends noticed me turning pale, getting jumpy and stuttering over my words and, rather than be supportive, just slapped me on the back and said condescendingly \"Oh, you'll be alright!\". \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn fact, my friends seemed positively overjoyed to see her and acted extremely cordially the whole time, which to me felt like a betrayal, considering they all knew how badly she treated me. One of them even offered to give her a lift home.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI suppose this post is my long-winded, slightly incoherent way of saying that neither she nor anyone else around us seems to be acknowledging her abuse, and I'm feeling a distinct lack of closure about it. She'll never be seen for the abuser that she was towards me, because she's so universally nice to everyone else. \nIn fact, I have trouble even believing her next relationship would be abusive, as she made a remark upon breaking up with me that our relationship has been \"a stepping stone towards being a better person\". She may never treat anyone like she treated me, because she may love them, unlike me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy friends, for the most part, have either denied the abuse, or the trauma it's left me with (\"Oh stop bitching and move on\") or have tried some measure of false diplomacy (\"You clearly just weren't compatible\"), and she'll likely never see any recourse for being the way she was with me behind closed doors, and it's honestly very hard to cope with.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHas anyone got advice on how to go on knowing that one's abuser will likely continue their lives totally unfazed by how they treated you, without consequence or regret? \nAnd how would one continue healing despite people not providing support and denying/not accepting that the abuse occurred? \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTangentially, how does one recover from that feeling of distinct, pervasive discomfort that comes from being body shamed by one you trust the most?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Wasn\u2019t really ready.\n\nThat changed a few months ago and now I\u2019m suspecting the woman I got involved with might be a narc. If so then I really fell hard for the love bombing. She showed empathy, had accountability and came across a absolutely wonderful human being. That\u2019s all gone now and while even as I type that I say to myself I should let her go I\u2019m having a hard time doing it. \n\nThings were going swimmingly until something happened and she got upset with me. It caused her to withdraw and nothing I did could bring her out of it. After weeks of that misery she broke things off with me. Stated she wanted to \u201cstart over\u201d to try and reset things. It didn\u2019t make any sense to me and after trying to convince her that wasn\u2019t necessary didn\u2019t work I went along with it. With the idea that I\u2019d just see what happens. Overall I\u2019ve been pretty nonchalant about it. We\u2019ve been talking but nothing has been happening between us romantically. \n\nI\u2019m having a hard time letting go of the hope that things will go back to the way they were or that she isn\u2019t a cluster b, that maybe I\u2019m just paranoid. Fuck, I had basically given up and then she reached out to me yesterday saying she was afraid I was with someone else. I ended up pouring my heart out to her in a last ditch effort to sway her to no avail. Now I\u2019m feeling hurt and even somewhat guilty about not keeping trying with her. It\u2019s the stupidest thing in the world and I know I eventually will walk away but it still fucking sucks.\n\nI\u2019m feeling better just typing this all out but still, I could really use some encouragement too.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

How should I proceed?", "author": "SpicyDragoon93", "self_text": "I have a \"friend\", I've known him now for about 5 years. I first met him when I was about 20/21, I'm now 26 and he's 43+ and for the longest time I've always known something was different, I just didn't know how. Anyway, we talk on the phone about issues that effect us and we have common cause, we're both dealing with stressful family situations but I have noticed that he appears to have some narcissistic traits, mainly classic symptoms and cerebral. It's worth noting that he's a remarkably talented musician which I know that creative types tend to display these traits in groups of people he's often charismatic, charming and can talk to large groups of people with relative ease. \n\nOn the phone the conversations always seem to fall into 3 main areas:\n\n\\- His ex-girlfriends: He will literally tell me the same stories about girlfriend x from 10 years ago about how he didn't even sleep with her and how she was \"this\" and \"that\", but then when I see her Facebook profile, she's since moved on in a new relationship and has a child. Another woman is successful and has her own career and place to live but he actually said that \"She won't get a better offer\", she's now having a baby with someone else. \n\n\\- Politics/Economy - Which are okay conversations to have but he'll often type same long essays over text and rehash the same talking points using often meaningless anecdotes and excessive use of platitudes. I'll get massive texts at 3 in the morning about his grand philosophical outlook, but it's always the same thing, he'll even use the same intonation when talking about them. Oh and everyone else he knows is dumb, they don't see the world the way he does because he's read more books than anyone ever. \n\n\\- His general disdain for other black people (we're both black - so internalized racism) and misogyny, he professes that he can't date a women whose been in an abusive relationship or who may have been sexual abused because they have too much \"baggage\" yet all I hear is how every relationship has been tragic or traumatic as though he has no baggage of his own. He especially dislikes black women which and given his bad relationship with his mother is obviously where it comes from but the way he talks about black people sometimes is with such disdain it'd be straight racism if he were a white man. \n\nIn person it's a slightly different story and one where I've often come away from the interaction feeling quite drained and frustrated so much so that the frustration lasts for quite sometime afterward, he can be very conceited and arrogant. We've been in coffee shops and there's been instances where he'll start bad-mouthing people nearby - on one occasion a young woman (early 20's) was doing something work with a laptop and he just started talking about how ugly he thought she was, she may have been able to hear and was just sitting their minding her own business but when I called him on it he didn't stop.\n\nThe very last meeting was two weeks ago and since I hadn't seen him in a year and a half in person I actually forgot about a lot of the things that seemed majorly problematic; he was quick to point out my flaws but his \"solutions\" didn't appear to be helpful although he later sent a text message acknowledging that he was overtly critical - but I can't work out if this is just a shot at \"reeling\" me back in. I think back to stories he's told me of past friends and partners, he's practically fallen out with everyone for one reason or another. \n\nHow exactly do I proceed with someone like this, is it better just phase them out or can you keep them around whilst being aware of the realities of the traits? I think because of my age I often struggle to have a frame of reference and since I try and empathize with people as often as possible and make sure that I'm not too judgmental, but lately I've been feeling overwhelmed.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

And to show others that being empath can be tough but there is real beauty in the gifts we carry in us.\n\nThis may be a long post but I really want to inspire, as I see a lot of empaths struggling with toxic people or overcoming the harder parts of being an empath. Which is letting toxic people go, because we love too damn hard! SO I would like to share my experience with difficult parts of being an empath as I know a lot of empaths on here have fallen into these very traps and cycles.\n\n*This year after a lot of overwhelming pain and exhaustion over the years. I was forced into therapy and medical help, as Id completely lost myself in a very toxic relationship. The relationship wasn't all bad, in fact I was madly in love and still to this day find it hard to break that love I have for them.*\n\n*I always see the best in people, even those who do me wrong or leave me in a tough spot in life. I understand why others find it difficult giving the support back.*\n\n*None of what I am saying is out of negativity towards my ex partner, I don't regret being with her, I send a lot of love her way and wish the best for her and future relationships. In fact this is all out of love and care, as I'm using my lessons learnt from being with her to help other empaths who are new to the realisation that they are one.*\n\n*I was diagnosed as an empath this year by two therapists, one was not an empath and the other was, who I am working with to this day. I explained my childhood to them as my ex blamed me as the issue of the relationship falling apart. I confronted my therapist with all my exes issues. (being afraid of conflict was the main one.) But this is a trait of an empath, which my therapist explained when we get approached with hate or negative energy we retreat and become mentally confused and exhausted.*\n\n*I don't blame my ex for this, but in those tough times which it was clear and visible I was ill and not myself, it was not right at all to blame me. I became ill as a result of worrying and helping her constantly. I knew it was coming, but I had hopes every day for the last two years she was finally making progress and that she was finally escaping those demons so I could rest*\n\n*My ex was struggling with some very bad depression, anxiety and low self esteem, which she's carried all her life so she told me. I knew this from the first few months of knowing her, and before knowing her I could see how broken she was from all her work as a music artist. Not just the music, but the videos, her posts on social media. Id even saw one that had self inflicted wounds on her arm.*\n\n*I can sense a lot of pain in everyone I thought this was normal... But I explained to my therapist I could never tell if my exe's pains were mine or not. But I knew I was absorbing it from her as I'd spend most nights up late worrying about where her mind is at, constantly on edge as she would question her life a lot, and it killed me.*\n\n*As past these pains and mental struggles I saw the most amazing girl. She was just damaged and alone, and I wanted to fix that with everything I had.*\n\n*Think I am the only person who ever understood what she is going through and has experienced in the past that made her this way, and all she struggled with over the years. My therapist believed she most likely had some form of Borderline Personality Disorder, I knew it was something as she seemed unstable and unbalanced. I always sensed something was not right. No one in her family believed in mental health and thought it was the work of the devil or something silly, so her going to her parents about her problems was not an option for her. I understood how truly alone she felt, I felt it.*\n\n***I felt it all.***\n\n*But she didn't recognise what I was sacrificing and that I was really trying to save her and I was convinced she knew, well I think she does know all I went through to try and bring her happiness and peace in life. If she didn't she was a fool as all my friends and family and even my colleagues would talk about all the sweet things and plans I had to save her. Id tell them it all because I was happy, because I had hope.*\n\n***Hope she would heal so we could really concentrate on us, without worry, with her finally happy and at peace with her life and herself. It was never about fancy dinners or the little things that bring temporary happiness, it was about getting her the permanent, balanced and wholeness she never had before.***\n\n***As how could I relationship last when one is sacrificing himself for someone who is broken. I had to make her whole or we would never be whole, and would never last. I knew her demons would arise and they did when I became to drained with helping her.***\n\n*When I 1st met her it was an odd feeling. Something was drawing me towards her, I felt as if she needed help and that was my main reason for talking to her at 1st. I always get drawn to helping people. Even throughout school I was always helping those in need and those being bullied to overcome their pains. I could just sense from her, her music work and just could feel how alone she was inside. Felt like I could really be there for her, so I spoke to her.*\n\n*Soon enough, we were talking all the time. Meeting up and having fun and opening up to each other. In the 1st year with her I thought it was time that Id approach her about her mental struggles. Crazy I remember it all like it happened just yesterday. She called her mental struggles \"limbo\".*\n\n*Since that very day in the 1st year of our relationship, I knew it was going to be tough with her and that I was going to have to put in most of the work to build this relationship and make it strong.*\n\n*And I did exactly that. It was extremely hard. She was always sad and always coming to me with her mental struggles. Which I didn't mind, as I wanted her to tell me them all so I could save her, and fight off her demons. As I knew long term if I don't free her from her them id never have the real her. Or experience her best side, free from demons and just happy in life.*\n\n*She was my best friend and I was willing to take in all her pains just to pull her out to her abundance of happiness that she never experienced in her past. Literally protecting her was like the biggest thing in my life. I would do silly things like walk on the side closest to the road, so if a driver came off I could save her 1st.*\n\n**But to be honest I would do that for anyone.**\n\n*Her depression and getting her out of it became my priority. But I had no idea that I was an empath in those days, and that need to help her was just built into me. That need to save others, is something that I feel the need to do and always have done. And through all of the ups and downs in her mind. All of the mood swings and times she questioned her existence\u2026 I knew deep down it was draining the energy out of me.*\n\n*Didn't realise this need to help her would be the reason I lost myself and became so ill. I am not blaming her in the slightest, as everyone has their demons and she had more than most. She is the 1st person I couldn't fully help or save... but it was this strong need to save as an empath that wouldn't let me give up on her.*\n\n*These moments of mental exhaustion and pain I experienced trying my best to help her. Most people would have left her, but I didn't want to be that person. Genuinely their were a lot of times where I would question my own sanity as I found in her episodes and times where moments got very tough for her it took a huge toll on my mind.*\n\n*I always knew when she was upset. Always knew when she was hiding something or lying. It was a lot of the time, and that in itself was exhausting. But she was so mentally fragile and I didn't want her to take a step back in all the progress we had made for her...*\n\n*In the final two years, she was became more and more demanding of me and my time. As we built this bond around helping her... This included helping her music, as that was her dream. And soon enough I found that dream becoming my own and helping her reach it. So most weekends we spent creating her music videos and other stuff like photography for her career.*\n\n*I knew this was making her happy and seeing her joy increase in her when she would upload our creations to her social media, it made me extremely happy. Made me feel I was finally saving her... But I was losing myself more and more. Doing all this for her was so exhausting for me mentally. As we couldn't concentrate on what relationship was meant to be.*\n\n**You guys can relate to this being empaths. When you feel the sad emotions in someone become happy it brings so much joy to us and warms us up. We want to continue helping more and more. I cherished these happy moments in her careers and her mental progression. As I could feel it, it was the only thing keeping me going in the exhaustion I was experiencing.**\n\n*These were the final two years together. The cycle of helping her became over time more demanding, she started to control me and my content as VFX Artist also. But I couldn't say no to her, or tell her how much she was draining me. I couldn't hurt her. I couldn't be the cause of her mental health going back down again.*\n\n*So I continued to support her. And things began to crumble as Id lost all sense of self. I didn't know who I was anymore. My life became helping her, 24/7 always consumed by thoughts of how she was and worrying. I hardly saw my friends and family. I actually never spent much quality bonding time with them at all.*\n\n*As when I was with my friends and family, I was never really there. My mind was always with her, making sure she was happy and her demons were at bay. I felt horrible to do this to them, as my whole life I've been giving my love and help to others, but all of the energy was given to her.*\n\n*So when things finally started to really crumble in the last year together. I was finally at a loss, I didn't know who I was anymore. I didn't know what I enjoyed outside of her. I realised id completely put my own self development on halt to save her.*\n\n*I was no longer myself anymore. I became isolated and spent many weekends alone in my room searching up what had happened to me. I had to lie to my friends and tell them I was out with her, and I had to lie to her and tell her I was out with friends. When I was sitting alone in my room exhausted, questioning my own existence like she was once.*\n\n*This was when her demons began to come up once again, I knew she felt alone and depressed again. She was beginning to separate from me in that year and I felt it throughout the whole year. But I drained, physically ill and friends and family became extremely worried that it was her.*\n\n*I found out this year that I developed a defiency in dopamine and hormones in my body which were making things a lot worse on my mind and made me ill. I actually ended up in hospital for blood tests and I am still taking medication to help solve this.*\n\n*She did leave me in a pretty nasty manner. As that last year I was cry out for help a lot and was clearly not me any more. It took one of my friends who said no to me pushing them away to take me to a therapist. That saved my life that move. But I am still hurt by how she didn't see all of these obvious struggles and changes in me. Think she did but her mind took it to a whole other level and her insecurities made it seem to her that I was abandoning or giving up on her.*\n\n*I feel that change had a really bad affect on her mentally. As I was no longer me, I was drained and unable to help her the way I always had done. Think this really made her feel alone.*\n\n*My therapist told me a lot of empaths end up in these kinds of relationships. Doing a lot of helping and we become drained and discarded. And that a lot of the time if the empath continues to help and help, even when they know its killing them they still carry on helping.*\n\n*Feel a strong need to be the hero and sacrifice themselves for others. I did exactly that with my ex, I don't regret it. But I do deep down wish I would have know that I was an empath and I could have put up healthy boundaries and have my own needs met in the relationship instead of making great sacrifices for their happiness.*\n\n*I know things would have turned out differently if i'd had known.*\n\n**It can be tough being an empath.** But I'd like to say none of this has ruined my thoughts on love or happiness, or people in that fact. Nothing can ruin the heart of an empath, our love always remains incredibly **POWERFUL**, with or without a partner. Our love is always genuine and never damaged and neither are our hearts.\n\nIn fact this has all made my heart so much stronger, I have been helping others on a private blog and podcast. Using my gifts, now I know that I am an empath to help others. I know I didn't fail my ex, I did what I could to save her but not all can be saved as my therapist said and I accept that. I sacrificed myself in the process, but that was on me.\n\nI am not seeking love or a relationship. I have been working hard to find myself and my identity again. Well I would say I have found myself again! Through therapy, spending time with those who love me, my friends and family, they are helping me remember once again. As I did exclude them to put my energy into helping her.\n\nPlus my therapist said after such an emotionally taxing relationship it is best I find myself and become the whole, loving and joyful person, helping the little guy, I always was, to share with another some day! I am almost whole again, still working on finding what I enjoy and what hobbies interest me long term. Literally I sacrificed most of who I was to save her.\n\nI sometimes do feel alone, but I enjoy it, discovering who I am again is pretty awesome. I am not seeking a relationship. I don\u2019t have a problem with being alone or in solitude, although I am not alone. True empaths know their happiness does not depend on having a partner.  If that\u2019s the case then no one in this world will ever experience true happiness if they depend on people in the world to make them happy.\n\n**This is my new goal now!** Finally feel I know who I am. I am a helper and a giver and I want to help those balance their lives and escape their demons and live free and happy. Yes this time I will not lose myself now I know I am an empath, I understand the boundaries I need in place.\n\nI am on the road to becoming an empowered empath so I can really amplify my help to others. Then hopefully if and when I encounter a soul that is hard to save I will know not to lose myself in the process.\n\nI have healed my wounds from that past relationship and I am truly thankful and blessed it all happened the way it did. I do forgive her and hopefully one day we may meet again and I can tell her I am an empath, as she never knew or understood. Think it'd answer a lot about me she didn't understand.\n\nAs a lot of people this year get so overwhelmed by my openness and understanding of their struggles. They get hesitant and don't understand why I am helping their problems as no one else really ever had or understood them.\n\nSo once you have healed your wounds you have to understand that our purpose here on earth is to raise the vibrations of the planet by helping others. There\u2019s work that has to be done out there to wake up others and help them heal to get them moving along their journey. Let\u2019s get to work, my fellow empaths!\n\nJust dont go sacrificing too much of your energy for others. Set bounderies understanding your traits as an empath. Take it from me you can genuinly lose yourself completly helping someone. But don't stop helping others!\n\nI don't want her to know about this and all I went through for her truly. All id sacrificed. As I still want to protect her happiness, I don't want this to hurt her.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I had cut off contact with  her after dealing with the fallout from dating a mutual friend who had  been abusive towards me. Unfortunately, it was not the happy reunion I  had hoped for and brought up some old, difficult feelings for me.\n\nThe  short version: I dated a woman who was into kink. I'm not. I didn't  know she was into rough sex until she first became rough with me (to the  point that she left bruises in sensitive areas). When I told her that  she was hurting me, she just shrugged and said she likes things rough.  Red flag, I know, but at the time I was really interested in her and  thought we were enjoying the honeymoon stage of a relationship. She  stopped being rough with me and seemed to respect my wishes to take  things slowly. But, I still had a niggling sense of things being 'off'  and when I spoke to her about my concerns at around the three-month  mark, she admitted that she wasn't interested in a relationship with me  and had decided to 'revert to casual' after the first two weeks of  dating. She had never said as much to me, even when having conversations  about our dating status, so no wonder things felt off! When I asked why  she did that, instead of just ending the relationship if she wasn't  into me, she told me that no one wants to be alone.\n\nI  can appreciate that sometimes people just aren't on the same page when  it comes to dating, but I told her that I would have expected honesty if  her feelings had changed. She became very angry with me then, and  implied that I was being delusional for thinking that she would have  ever been interested in a real relationship with me. I said I thought  her behaviour was cruel and that I didn't think staying friends (as she  wanted) would be healthy. She became upset and cried, but I held firm,  and she told me to let her know when I felt like seeing her again. I  stepped back from our mutual friends and shared activities for a few  months, but after some encouragement from mutual friends, reached out to  her. I let her know that I was still upset about what happened, but  that I was open to mediation, or at least putting a schedule in place so  that we could enjoy our social circle without having to bump into each  other unexpectedly. She became angry again, said I was a liar, that I  was making it all up to hurt her, and she instructed a solicitor to  prevent me from contacting her again or telling anyone else what had  happened.\n\nOk, so that 'short  version' is a lot longer than I expected! And there's still so much left  out, but I never really recognised her behaviour as abusive or  controlling until I spoke with a therapist about it. I knew that I would  need to remove myself from our shared activities and friends for my own  mental health, so that's what I did.\n\nI  am moving soon, so wanted to catch up with old friends before leaving  the city. Hence, the dinner with the mutual friend last night.  Unsurprisingly, she knew nothing of it and had assumed that I was just  having a hard time dealing with the break up. I tried to explain that  there was more to it than that, and I wasn't interested in hearing any  updates about the woman I had dated. My friend told me they are still in  touch and hang out occasionally, so at that point I made clear that it  had been an abusive situation, and I really didn't want to know. She  told me that she doesn't want to take sides and that she hopes I will  heal from the relationship in time.\n\nI  get that sometimes people can't imagine a friend being abusive,  especially if they've never seen that side of them, but it's still  hurtful. I know now that I will have to go back to limiting contact with  mutual friends as it just isn't good for me to be around people who  don't want to 'tale sides.' But it's just so hard feeling unsupported  and unheard, especially when the woman who did this to me called me a  liar and even accused me of being abusive for telling her how I felt  about her actions. I've done enough reading to understand that this can  be a common reaction to speaking up, but understanding the dynamic  intellectually is so different from trying to cope with it and move on.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I loved getting fucked up with my friends every weekend I was living my best life.. then one time I was at a party &amp; I got way to drunk &amp; went to lay down. The room was spinning &amp; I couldn\u2019t function, this boy from the party walked in &amp; seen me. He got me water &amp; tried to make me feel better. Then he asked if I wanted to fuck, I told him no but he didn\u2019t listen. He raped me.. I was trying so hard to fight but he held me down &amp; continued fucking me, he was so rough with me. I had carpet burn on my back from him sliding me across the carpet with each hard thrust. He put a tee shirt in my mouth to keep me from screaming. I was crying the whole time but he didn\u2019t care, when he was finished he told me how tight I was &amp; how great my pussy felt. I laid there crying after he left, because not only did he rape me he took my virginity.. I finally took the shirt out of my mouth &amp; walked out of the room completely naked with blood running down my thighs. My friends seen me &amp; freaked out. I told them when happened &amp; who did it &amp; the guys at the party beat the absolute fuck out of him.. when they was finished with him you couldn\u2019t tell who he was because of the swelling.. I got my justice... my friends was very supportive &amp; helped me get myself together. They felt guilty for what happened to me.. the weekend came to an end &amp; we got back to our lives like nothing happened. \n\nMonths passed by &amp; I met a guy.. we started dating &amp; I thought I found the love of my life he treated me like a queen, he got me anything I wanted &amp; spoiled me. We did everything together he was my best friend.. he got into a accident &amp; had to have surgery, he loved the pain medication so much that he got hooked, he was still so good to me I ended up moving in with him , I dropped out of school &amp; shortly after found out I was pregnant, my life was perfect my boyfriend would give me massages for hours &amp; get me anything I needed. One day I started bleeding &amp; found out I lost the baby.. I was depressed &amp; he was there for me through it all holding my hand every step of the way. After I lost the baby he showed me different drugs I\u2019ve never tried before we was popping X &amp; dropping acid together. Having the time of our lives then we tried meth &amp; heroin &amp; anything we could get our hands on, we loved each other &amp; did everything together. He sold drugs &amp; used the profit to give me everything. He bought me a car , I got my hair done every other day &amp; I got my nails done every week. I got designer clothes, bags &amp; shoes. We had so much money we didn\u2019t know what to do with it. Our sex life was amazing &amp; we never had to be sober, life was amazing..  after about two years of living without a care we bought a house in cash had a few different cars &amp; everything we wanted. I noticed my boyfriend was shooting up heroin &amp; I couldn\u2019t continue to watch him do it.. so I told him I was leaving.. we have never been in an agreement the whole 3 years we was together, he never even raised his voice to me before.. when I started to pack he went insane &amp; told me I wasn\u2019t leaving.  I brushed it off &amp; I started to pack he started punching me repeatedly, I ran for the front door &amp; he chased me, he choked me &amp; slapped me repeatedly then threw me to the ground &amp; told me how much he loved me &amp; that I wasn\u2019t leaving him.  I played along &amp; once he calmed down I ran for the door, he grabbed me by my hair and repeatedly opened &amp; slammed the door on my face &amp; body. Then drug me to the bathroom &amp; filled the tub with only hot water, he drug me to the kitchen &amp; grabbed a knife he cut my clothes off &amp; cut me all over my body I wouldn\u2019t stop screaming so he put dirty socks in my mouth and duct taped my mouth shut he wrapped the tape around my head &amp; over my mouth so tight then he taped my hands behind my back, I tried running again &amp; when he caught me he picked me up &amp; threw me into the scolding hot tub &amp; held me down with his foot until he couldn\u2019t take the heat anymore &amp; pulled me out. I continued to fight so he cut me more with the knife then grabbed the salt &amp; told me to calm down. I did, he took me to the bed room then he tied my ankles to each end of the bed post. Then told me to be good &amp; cut my hands free , he then tied my hands to the top of the bed post. I couldn\u2019t move at all then he got some meth from the stash &amp; said we\u2019re gonna have fun just relax. I couldn\u2019t stop crying, he left the room &amp; started cleaning up the mess while I was tied to the bed. He came back after what felt like hours &amp; I calmed down. He uncut the tape from my mouth &amp; pulled the socks out, he told me if I screamed he would shot me &amp; held a gun to my head. He got me some water &amp; gave me 3 Xanax bars , he took a wash rag &amp; cleaned me up. Then he cuddled up next to me &amp; told me I was his everything &amp; I\u2019m never leaving him. That I will only be his forever. I passed out &amp; woke up the next morning still tied to the bed. He cooked me breakfast &amp; treated me like nothing ever happened, he was loving on me &amp; rolled up a blunt for me &amp; we smoked together then he make me a margarita, I told him I had to pee so he took my hands &amp; hand cuffed them then untied the rope, he told me if I tried to run he would kill me so he took me to the bathroom &amp; i peed then he ran some bath water &amp; bathe me. Then took me back to the bed &amp; hand cuffed me back to the bed. We talked about everything &amp; he told me that I will have to gain my trust back before things got back to normal, I told him I understood &amp; tried to gain back my trust. I was living like this for weeks. I woke up one day &amp; he wasn\u2019t there so I tried to escape I tried so hard to get free but only got one leg free before he caught me. He tied me up tighter gagged me then left. He came back an hour later with pad locks for the door &amp; put them in then nailed a board to the window in the bedroom &amp; the bathroom. He walked over to me &amp; told me I\u2019m not leaving him &amp; I have to gain my trust back again, I started crying uncontrollably &amp; he hugged me &amp; told me not to cry that he is here for me. He did another bump of meth &amp; continued to fix the room so I couldn\u2019t escape , he came back later with more food &amp; drugs for me. He took off my gag &amp; I asked why is he doing this &amp; he smiled &amp; said because you\u2019re my soulmate &amp; i love you so fucking much. I started to cry he hugged me &amp; gave me a kiss &amp; told me everything will be okay . Days pass by &amp; I\u2019m still trapped &amp; my boyfriend is still pretending that nothing happened . He would leave my legs tied up but he would let my hands free so I can eat &amp; smoke, he would still cook for me &amp; bring me gifts, I started to act like I use to &amp; we would laugh &amp; everything was back to the old ways.. he walked away &amp; I tried to free my legs every chance I got, I was almost free when he caught me he gagged me &amp; tied me back up while I was fighting to get free he pulled out his gun &amp; told he that he warned me , he took off the gag &amp; I told him to kill me that I couldn\u2019t live like this anymore to send me home, he lost his shit &amp; started pacing back and forth talking nonsense. He put pills in my mouth &amp; made me swallow them I was trying to scream for help &amp; he started choking me until I blacked out. I woke up to him slapping me repeatedly I started begging for him to kill me but he started crying, he ripped my clothes off &amp; started kissing me all over I begged him to kill me so he grabbed his gun &amp; shoved it down my throat. He asked if this is what I wanted &amp; I shook my head yes. He repeatedly shoved the gun in &amp; out of my throat until I puked then continued doing it again. I begged for him to kill me &amp; he took the gun &amp; shoved it in my vagina &amp; started fucking me with it, I started to scream &amp; he covered my mouth &amp; I tried biting him to get him to stop but he kept going. Finally he stopped &amp; put his dick inside me &amp; fucked me. He gagged me again &amp; I couldn\u2019t stop crying I wanted to die. He started eating me out &amp; told me to cum. He didn\u2019t stop until I did. I felt defeated &amp; I wanted to die. He pumped me full of drugs &amp; continued to fuck me for the the next two days. When I refused to eat, he would force it down my throat. I was trapped in that hell for the next 3 weeks until one day I escaped , he was asleep &amp; I managed to break free I took the car keys &amp; his money &amp; drive miles away from that hell. I drove to the police station county\u2019s away from there &amp; walk inside, I didn\u2019t have clothes on &amp; I was covered in bruises &amp; marks. The police gave me a jacket &amp; I explained everything that happened. They was in shock. They called the police in the town he was in &amp; got busted into the  house &amp; arrested him. My ex boyfriend took a plea deal &amp; spent only 2 years in prison. The justice system is a fucking joke. It took a long time to get back to normal. I moved far away &amp; never told my friends what happened to me, I started a new life. I never want to go back to that hell. I started to finally take my life back after living in fear for a year, I made new friends, I started dating again &amp; I felt so free . I started working at a job I enjoyed &amp; never told anyone my past. One day I received a call saying that my ex was released from prison &amp; the fear came back. I didn\u2019t feel safe anymore. I called the police department every day for a update &amp; had the local police watch my house at night. I finally started to get better. As time passed by I started to recover &amp; I live my life without fear &amp; I\u2019m finally free from the grip my abuser .

Over the course of the next 2ish years we basically established this off again on again (mostly off) \"thing\" where he'd try to explain he liked me and wanted to be with me but was \"afraid\" or \\*insert excuse\\* and wanted to see how things go - which would really just turn into me submitting to whatever he wants from me, which is basically a purely sexual relationship and I'd try to be every single thing he wanted and walk on egg shells to meet this desire so he wouldn't leave me again and finally give me a real chance. I suppressed a lot of my emotions and needs and dug them down deep so I could be what he expected of me. I realize now that ignoring your emotions eventually leads to not being able to recognize your emotions and leads to a lot of mental health issues. I was always in denial and wanted to truly believe he wanted things to work out but couldn't because of his own issues but maybe eventually he'd \"see the light\" and that I love him.\n\nHe knew and joked about the fact he knew he had power over me - that i was weak enough to always come back, and he'd make a lot of jokes that hurt me and insinuated that. I tried over and over again to move on but it was such a strong addiction and the withdrawal symptoms were always so horrible I wanted to die, and hated myself. I'd go no contact but eventually after a few months cave - or i'd display behaviors like texting him when drunk to give myself the excuse I was drunk so it's fine - he'd mostly only contact me after 1am to talk. He was so manipulative with his \"talks\" that never meant anything, saying he wants to talk about us and sit down and try to understand one another, he'd stand me up all the time, manipulate my words or anything that would keep me in my place and keep the relationship how he wanted.\n\nI honestly always had the hardest time understanding why he would keep doing this when he knows it hurts me to death rather than find a girl with a compatible need.\n\nFlash forward this year I promised myself I wouldn't sleep with him for all of 2019. I started talking to my now boyfriend- which that in itself is an issue because he really does love me and i feel like I \\*love\\* him, but being in this narc relationship with trauma bonding has made it difficult for me to accept love isn't some roller-coaster high and obsessive which unfortunately feels so addicting. My bf knows the whole shtick and for a while let me keep talking to the N but eventually couldn't take it anymore so made me tell him I officially have a bf.\n\nIn a way it was really hard but in a way it was good because when the narc kept trying to contact me after I told him I'm in a relationship I honestly felt kind of disgusted. Like he clearly doesn't care about me - he only wants me for his needs - he doesn't care I'm in a relationship that I won't/don't want to cheat with him, he doesn't care that me meeting up with him WOULD mean I'm a cheater. I don't know - it just really made it clear that he just wants what he wants. I've been lucky in whenever an ex gets a new gf I easily become over them because they are now in a relationship and I have no desire to meddle.\n\nAnyway he'd send me vague messages on Instagram at 1am+ for a while - a wave emoji, a compliment. If I'd respond he'd wait until the following Saturday at 3am to respond. Eventually I had enough because it was just causing stress in my heart, in my relationship, in my mental health so I blocked him on Facebook, Instagram, phones ect.\n\nIt's funny because literally just last week on a Tuesday I woke up at 4am thinking about him and cracked looking at his stuff from a separate Instagram account he doesn't know about. I know it's normal to sometime have these intense waves of missing from the bonds but I just looked and went back to my own things and was normal after a few days\n\nIt's even more funny because sometimes I feel like they JUST KNOW. This past Saturday after months of radio silence I see a message request from his old band's Instagram page at 3am saying \"You &lt;3\"\n\nIt's really hard honestly. I just read it and didn't respond but my heart instantly wants to go back to how can I finally make this work, while my mind wants to justify why I'm not in contact and I'm happy with a supportive man that loves me. Luckily at 11pm that following night I had the realization again that it's really just a drunk chance at seeing if I'm vulnerable enough to go to him at 3am and have sex with him again and after that thought my heart stopped trying so hard with its gymnastics to figure out how to make things work. To be honest he's the ONLY man I've ever dated that continues to throw me breadcrumbs/hoovers for this long\n\nwish I could get answers, wish I could tell him what he does makes him a bad person, wish I could make him feel what he makes me feel. I wonder what things he's tried saying to my blocked numbers - it wouldn't matter but I think it's normal to wonder. I don't know why he'd go to the effort of messaging me from an alter but I won't know and I need to keep looking forward but sometimes its REALLY hard. really sets me back. It sucks cause I know deep down I LOVE getting hoovers - which is why I blocked him in the first place\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Narc emotional abuser texts me from alternate Instagram account after I've blocked him from everything - having emotional troubles from it", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He said it made me sound \u00bbentitled to his free time\u00ab and that I sounded like I was jealous and trying to guilt him into not going out (I have very few local friends and am a bit of an introvert \u2013 I don't have much of a social life myself, tbh).   \n \n\nWhat IS true is that the first few times he kinda flaked on me I did express that I was upset about it. Maybe I overreacted to some degree? It shouldn't have been a big deal but I was basically left sitting at my PC, waiting, with no explanation and I did say he should have texted me\u2026 and I think he then kept that perception of me for the rest of the relationship? I'm not sure though\u2026   \n I remember we also had a small argument once because I'd asked him if we could do a Skype call/movie night the night my mom went to hospital for surgery and he got invited to go out instead and I was very obviously not happy about it - I think that was probably a bit irrational on my part\n\nAt the time I thought it was normal to be slightly disappointed about not being able to spend time with my partner sometimes \u2013 but maybe that did come across as manipulative? He did have a right to have a life outside of spending time with me\n\nI think I'd been pushed far enough to say \u00bbjust fuck off/f you\u00ab maybe.. I'd like to say maybe 3x in the space of 4 years that I'd been dating him? I think every time came after a long argument with the usual name calling (retarded, jealous bitch, dumb cunt, etc) and I'd failed to de-escalate things through calm discussion or I got upset to the point of crying/losing my cool. I don't believe in name calling so I'd normally apologise and walk off to calm down\u2026 I know that was still a bad reaction on my part though. I think if that happens again in the future I shouldn't let myself get that upset?\n\nSpeaking of, is it bad to try and discuss what happened the day before if the argument didn't actually end up going anywhere productive and the issue still feels like it's there and needs to be resolved? Or is that kinda provoking a new fight\u2026 Where's the line? I feel like it often felt like I just managed to provoke more anger even if I tried to ask about it in a neutral way and maybe I shouldn't have pushed the issue? Just that the same problem would then often end up coming up again and again\u2026\n\nAlso, if I get sad/upset enough about something in a bad argument to the point where it legit makes me cry \u2013 is that potentially manipulative/childish? I didn't always (successfully) hide it from him and it usually made him get angry with me or tell me to \u00bbgrow the f up\u00ab.. I didn't think of it as manipulative at the time, but I guess maybe it's not the most mature reaction? Is it better to hide it or walk away before it gets to that point? I guess maybe I'm a bit sensitive/overreact?\n\nI did talk to him about his drinking habits (he had no idea when to stop) when going out a few times and I think that came across as controlling too? \n\nI do know one issue was I feel like sometimes I just needed someone to listen and he kinda skipped listening to offer a solution (usually something i'd thought of before and didn't think would work for me/my situation) and then got annoyed because \"what's the point of talking to you if you won't listen to anything i say\" if I didn't go with it or maybe still wanted to discuss stuff \u2013 is the \u00bbnot listening\u00ab on my side a potential issue/red flag?\n\nI feel like sometimes I'd try and do what he asked me to (adjusted behaviour based on his complaints) but I'd then go weeks thinking \"yay, i've fixed it\" only to have him explode at me in anger and say I haven't changed at all either out of the blue or if I'd had a bad day and was in a noticeably bad/not super social mood... Is there anything beyond asking for/expecting feedback I should have been doing?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

They can't work, they scream, they break shit, and wake up the entire household because it's fucking all about them. Then, when the other people cant take anymore it gets thrown back in their faces. Often times in the form of a threat. Threats include: \"I'll beat the shit out of you (which sometimes they act in it), I'll leave, fine then you leave,\" or plain threaten to hurt themselves. This adds to the punishment of them twisting it back on you, which includes: \"you're blaming me, I'm nice, everyone treats me like shit, I'm mad, what about my feelings? Will you just stop/lower your voice?\" After threatining, punching, screaming, breaking, and even crying, crying in such a child like tantrum, something you'd hear from an 8 year old. \n\nSome of the worst is the childish name calling, like literally stuff the big dumb kid that everyone was half afraid of would say to you on a regular basis, except it's actually scary coming from an adult. \n\nThey interrupt you until you forget your side of the story. Often times that interruption is \"no, listen to me\" me me me... Over and over again. They have no back up no explaination, no true or objection as they use that as a ploy to get you to trail off and stumble on your words. Again, it's all about them because they have that oh so fragile self image to protect. They know when you find them out, so they try and protect themselves. They are so worried that you'll worsen their narcissistic injury. It's catastrophic for anyone outside to possibly see them in their true form. They're subconsciously scared to see it themselves. It's too hard for them to take that first step in self improvement. So they'll say or do anything to convince people otherwise, they'll even change their tone. They are shape shifters and it's scary to see it in action. You'll know when you see it. They like to say something happened or didn't happen, depending on the situation. Whichever makes them look better.\n\nEverything thing explained previously happens on a weekly to 3 times a month basis, so that means we're lucky to get a week of normalcy because that's the week they promise to change, but still refuse to go to therapy. \n\nThey think it gets swept under the rug, but the sad thing is that it does sometimes because everyone is just so tired of fighting. We want peace, so we get it temporarily, they start up again, and it ends up getting twisted into 3 more weeks of fighting and wanting to give up because they regain power when all you're trying to do is cool down from the last fucking explosion, manage your own life, your own baggage. They dont have the skills or emotional maturity to learn from a mistake, or something that made their life hard. \n\nWhen there's a health issue, they shape up for two minutes and go right back to doing what makes them sick as soon as their back to normal, and then get mad when you bring it up or offer solutions. The make a problem. Ring a bell?\n\nThey think everyone is out to get them, even fucking people on xbox live they DON'T FUCKING KNOW!! This is why they are ultra defensive. It's insecurity at it's absolute finest. They're always looking out for that next person that's gonna see through their shit. They don't want the exposure, they need to be looked at as the nicest person at all times, they need to be right while being the nicest person, even though they just threatened to beat the shit out of someone and more than likely punched a hole in the damn wall while fracturing their hand. \n\nThey're normally addicted to 1-3 different things. The addictions more than likely make them unable to do stuff like drive or hold a job, whether they won't or are in trouble and can't , so when it's time to score dope, they get cutsie, start asking for rides to the plug, and money. They'll even call the plug and ask them to drop whatever and serve them at that moment. That often times leads to altercation, then traces back to the victimization, then the anger, tantrums and threats, sometimes taken out on a person not involved at all in any way. When they are not served at the absolute moment they need, it's hell. Them not getting their way is the biggest problem. It leads to the worst gaslighting, guilt tripping, and threatening, especially when it comes to drugs and addictions. \n\nThe sad thing is that they truly do not get it. They really think their behavior is okay, and that their the victim every single time. They really don't know how to locate the shit on the bottom of their shoes, so it'll just continue to smell for them and the people they drag down. They're so convinced their right, that the last words, late at night, at the end of an altercation are, \"I'm tired, I cant take it anymore.\" After punishing/abusing everyone else, they're still the victim. It's all about what everyone else can do for them. The worst thing is that they will sleep like babies right after these fights, while everyone else is now pulling an all-night-er.\n\nTL;DR narcissistic people twist everything back on you after threatening you and victimizing themselves, all wile throwing a childlike tantrum until you forget your own side of the story. Just watch out everyone. This rant is to simply spread awareness so you know what to look for. I urge you to keep reading about this disease in order to stay aware. If you read it great! If not, you should, and look at others. Look at some professional peices on it as well.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He told me that he didn't want me to go and that he'd miss me. I told him that if he really wanted to check up on me sometimes that he could message me. \n\n2 days later he messages me saying he misses me. We exchange a few messages and then he suddenly says \"I don't want to talk to you anymore. You called me ugly behind my back\". Which I swear on everything, I never did. I was genuinely surprised and stressed out again by yet another accusation of him and told him that I never called him ugly and that he should please show me proof of me calling him ugly. \n\nThen he sends me a screenshot of my friend (whom he probably was in some fight with again) saying \"even roseussorrow said you're ugly\". I told him \"I don't know why she would say that, because I never said to her that I think you're ugly\". I also told him that I can't afford to deal with his false accusations now as well because I'm in enough pain and stress as it is. I told him to indeed please not talk to me anymore if all he's gonna do is falsely accuse me. (I'm so tired of this now because I went through him falsely accusing me of so many things for so long). \n\nI told him that I was sorry and that I could maybe deal with this another time. I promised that I was attracted to him and that I don't think he's ugly and never have, and that I NEVER ever said that either. After I literally told him \"I don't find you ugly\" he says \"I don't wanna talk to you anymore, you're repulsed with me. I always thought you're pretty, *and it hurts that you think I'm ugly*\". I literally told him that I don't think he's ugly one message before that. He literally comes into my life to falsely accuse me, and attack me over something that I LITERALLY never even said!!! I don't understand. How can you just get mad at someone for calling you ugly when they never even did that? I ignored him after that. Because I'm hurt just thinking about it, and I can't deal with him hurting me even more. The next day he messages me again starting his message with \"I hate you\". He typed out a message that was mostly in caps, but I didn't even read it because I know it will hurt me and upset me. In the first sentence I saw that he said \"You never loved me\". It hurts that he hates me and that he accuses me that I never loved him over an accusation that HE made up about me. It never even crossed my mind to think he's ugly. Today he said \"my exes loved me more than you did. I should have never dated you\". ... seriously? I loved him unconditionally and I put up with so much from him. He has treated me so horribly to the point where I was convinved he was an actual sadist, and I still stayed with him, and all I get is \"You never loved me. *I* should have never dated *you*\". WHAT??? \n\nI blocked him now. To think that he just goes and hurts me even more when he knows how bad I was already doing...

I think like many here I have my doubts about it. My ex would tell me how much he loved me all the time, text me good morning beautiful, and if I so much as coughed he would get me some water or tea. He held open doors for me, wished me good luck for whatever it was on my life, and so on. That\u2019s what makes it difficult for me because when he was happy it was like a fairytale. Is it abuse if he\u2019s not constantly wearing you down and being mean? \n\nTLDR;\nHe forbade me from going out at night and drinking.\nHe wanted continuous contact. I shared what I did always, he was always doing nothing\nIf I didn\u2019t respond to texts in a timely manner hell was to follow.\nHe called a slut, whore, cunt, etc on multiple occassions. He has thrown things at me on one occassion, and shoved me at another. He accused me of cheating about every three months. \n\n\n\nHowever, he was demanding. When I was raped, he was angry that I lied about it at first. We hadn\u2019t been together too long and it was obviously very traumatic. He said he couldn\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t trust him, and ever since he would periodically blow up about lying. He said I shouldn\u2019t go out and drink (I\u2019m 22 and in university) because when I did he would stay up all night worrying. I had to text him constantly, tell him who I was with, send pictures to verify it, and if I didn\u2019t respond he would sulk and fight. The first really bad fight was when I drank a cider with his father, brother, and him in a restaurant. \u2018We\u2019 had decided to go sober for 30 days. He yelled that I would never change, that I could never quit smoking, drinking, and would never improve myself. I was doomed to be shitty, and how stupid was he for loving me? I ran out of the bedroom and he tried to grab me. I hid in the garden from him because I was so upset. But after he apologised and he seemed so remorseful all was well.\n\nFirst I thought my rape was what made things tense. He got angry about it a lot, claiming I wasn\u2019t telling him the whole story and lying constantly. He couldn\u2019t trust me! He broke up with me twice about it. The first time he said that a man with respect could not be with a woman who had so blatantly cheated on him. The second time was at 7AM, and he misused my house key to surprise me in my bedroom. He woke me up to break up with me. This was after he read the police report wherein they decided to not prosecute for lack of evidence. He said I wasn\u2019t raped and that I made up this whole story to cover up the fact that I was a common, filthy slut. He knew it, and my friends and family knew it too. I was just a drama queen making up elaborate ruses to hide what a shitty person I was. I was using him to feel better about myself because therapy was useless for me. I am depressed because I know what a shitty person I am. I told him to leave but he wouldn\u2019t. He towered over me (he\u2019s 6\u20193\u201d) and just kept yelling. But I didn\u2019t want to lose him so we made up and he wanted to have sex immediately after. It made me feel horrible but I just wanted to give him what he wanted.\n\nThe first time he became physical was at a party. We had spent the entire party together, and the run up to the party as well (we were both volunteers.... first only I was asked but I got them to let him volunteer too so he wouldn\u2019t be pissed). Never could we hang out after volunteering with the rest of the group. We met through volunteering here and the group were mutual friends. \n\nBut at the party he suddenly decided I had had too much to drink and I had to go to the hotel. The way there he was yelling at me, saying I had no control and it was embarrassing of me. A friend of ours called offering a free shot, and he then marched me back to the party, take the shot (which I didn\u2019t want after his tirade), and then continued to be angry about my drinking. I was tipsy, but I mean, I was with him the entire time. It came out of nowhere. We had a huge fight in the room, which ended with him kicking me out and throwing my bag and things at me as he did so. I was petrified, my heart beating so fast because I thought that he might hit me next. When I said this he calmed down, saying that he would never do that and how could I think that?\n\nHe laid his hands on me the first time quite recently. It was on holiday with his family. He\u2019d said something funny to me, mistaking his cousin for a woman or something like that when I showed him his cousin\u2019s Instagram. I wanted to say it to his brother, and he got livid. He held his hand over my mouth. He got up, shoved his chair against me and then me, then stormed off. Nobody in his family said anything, and I was just stunned.\n\nI started bringing these things up. He called me a slut, a whore, a cunt, bitch, white trash, etc. on my 21st birthday party with ALL of my closest friends and family there to witness it. He then broke up with me for it. The reason was because a friend said in a speech that I\u2019d kissed a lot of guys - but he had kissed more. My ex knew this part of my past since the beginning of our relationship. After this he was much more jealous, accusing me of sleeping with my flatmate a week after shoving me and two weeks after this incident. It was justified of him to ask because I hadn\u2019t checked my WhatsApp in four hours. He yelled at me over the phone for an hour at 5AM. The 21st birthday party was so public that I found the strength to take a break and he was very remorseful after, finally admitting that he was wrong and had an anger issue that needed addressing. Nothing changed except that he got me some fancy jewelry.\n\nOne time he waited for me at my place, again misusing the key when I had gone out to a bar with friends. When he started sending me nasty text messages, I put my phone on airplane mode. If I ever said I didn\u2019t want to talk he would barrage me with over 30 calls. He would ask me always what I was doing, but if I asked him he would respond with \u2018nothing\u2019, \u2018just chilling\u2019. I shared but he was closed off. If he had issues, he was allowed to ignore me for hours and I couldn\u2019t get upset because I should support him when he felt bad. Why would I make him feel worse? Not that he would ever say what those issues were...\n\nBut all of this took place over 1,5 years. Most of the time I loved being together with him. I felt like I could have more space, but he was such a sweet and loving boyfriend that I was okay with it. I miss him. I wonder if I will find somebody better. He is handsome, smart, usually kind and sweet, and so devoted to me. Is this all truly abuse?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I currently live in my friend's house where we have separate living spaces, we've been friends for about 7 years and grew closer after she broke up with an ex of 7 or 8 years. I should point out that I am a man, and have been very open with her about wanting to be in a relationship, and she's been very open about not feeling the same. The major reasons for her not at least giving it a shot is because I'm still trying to find a career, while she's working on grad school as well as working at a real job. We also have different personalities, I'm more laid back and smell the roses, while she's constantly on the go and efficient and particular about her time. Which is understandable.\n\nWe've been \"best friends\" during this period of time, in which I have repeatedly commuted an hour to see her before moving down to live with her, some of these times I traveled just to give her flowers or care package when she had a bad day or feeling ill. I have bought her jewelry, brought her food and coffee in the morning or when she was at work, talked to her on the phone multiple times a day every week (sometimes for hours at a time) most of which consists of listening to her, I used to send her flowers bi-weekly, offered help around the house pulling weeds, helping with repair projects, dishes, household chores, I've treated her to dinners, shows, and bought tickets to concerts, etc. We both send I love you, appreciate you, and good morning and good night messages.\n\nAnd on the same note, she has been very blunt on pushing me to grow and succeed, opening my eyes to how the real world works, she has surprised me on my birthday and valentines with well thought out meaningful surprises, invited me and treated me to dinner and concerts. And overall we've had such loving, supportive, and precious memories.\n\nNow what makes me confused and concerned is that throughout these seven years, we've basically had a romantic relationship minus any commitment and sex (she says she wants to wait until marriage to have sex again). We've cuddled, I've given her massages, and we've made out, and although she's very critical about my hands touching her, she is very handsy. And normally when we have physical intimacy it seems to be on her terms or initiated with the notion that I need to be consoled because she made me feel bad, and leaves the moment something doesn't go her way and this extends to a lot more.\n\nWhen going anywhere, be it vacations or even the store. There is a constant stream of criticism, blame, and being mad about something I've done or neglected to do. She constantly questions my ability to think, make decisions, or handle any task. She blames my upbringing and experience and constantly reminds me that she doesn't trust me. Some of these things are not doing to dishes correctly, cutting vegetables right, walking too close to her while shopping (following her like a puppy), not making sure her car door is locked, not putting the dog leashes on right, not being fast and efficient enough at doing tasks such as getting out of the car or sweeping. She also doesn't let me do any task because she doubts my ability to do it right. The major issues she has with me is my ability to hear or communicate effectively. I admit I do have some difficulties hearing, and I sometimes am unable to focus if theres a lot on my mind or other things going on. But it gets to the point that if I don't hear her and ask her to repeat she gets frustrated, if I try and assume I knew what she said and she realizes it she gets frustrated. And I admit most of it is just trying my best to listen to what she's saying and when I miss something I panic.\n\nI find that most of our hanging out is very unpleasant and it seems that most of the time our interactions are a ticking time bomb where she's bound to have a problem with something, or is poking fun at how I talk, act, or passive-aggressively gives me a piece of my own medicine which involves pretending not to hear me, and then smiles as if to say see how it feels. And I will take responsibility that I have my moments of not hearing, but its never on purpose. What's unfortunate for me is that I see her acting so kind and friendly to everyone around me, and she works in a place that helps the community, and gives to less unfortunate people and causes. And every time I try and bring up what she's doing, she always comes up with an argument that makes sense, and I feel like I'm the bad guy and overreacting. She says that she only has these issues with me and i tell her the same. It sucks because I do love her and when those spurts of good times happen they are so good, but I find myself wanting to escape. I realized i don't feel listened to, my interests are either childish, comes second to her pursuits or interests, or just plain uninteresting to her and when we talk things out it comes down to me listening to her day, having to change, and if we decide to spend time apart so I can \"grow\", she always initiates first by inviting me somewhere even though she says she doesn't like so many parts of what makes me ME. I've slowly started to become more aware of these things, and realize what I'm worth, especially when she comments on men that she hits it off with and compares me to. So I just need feedback on whether my logic makes sense, if im in a manipulative co-dependent relationship, etc. or if im truly just not changing and she's just trying to get me adult life ready.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Up until about a month or two ago, I\u2019ve been obsessed with making him happy and just wanting everything to be okay all the time and trying to please him so he would maybe act like he likes me and wants to be with me, but over that last month or two, I have not had the energy or urge to be loving. Of course i\u2019m not rude but I wake up to next to him everyday and sneak out of bed to be able to sit for an hour in peace and drink my coffee and do things that make me happy. My heart drops as soon as I hear him get up. The moment he walks out and looks at me it\u2019s right off the bat \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d or \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wake me up?\u201d and I can barely even smile when I make a dumb excuse as to why I wanted alone time. I feel so resentful towards him but I still love him at the same time. One of our biggest problems lately is the fact the he always wants me home but he can stay out late with friends and ignore my texts and he always lies about where he is. Then when he comes home, the first thing he does is turn on his PS4 and put on his headset to talk to his long distance friends and play PUBG for hours. And then he\u2019s upset when I\u2019m sad we spend no quality time together. I feel like i\u2019ve given up on our relationship. He absolutely destroyed my birthday yesterday as he does every year. Made everything about himself. He played his stupid game all day, and when we agreed on go seeing a movie to celebrate he invited his friends. He then got super mad that I wasn\u2019t having a great time (I wasn\u2019t pouting or complaining) but he said I wasn\u2019t being super talkative or thanking him. I thanked him numerous times throughout the night for paying for the movie but he claims I never said so and made a big issue out of it. Then when we got home he told me to clean the kitchen so he could cook me dinner. Nice right? He made burgers. He knows I literally hate burgers but it\u2019s his favorite food. Every time we go out my only stipulation is \u201chey let\u2019s go to a place that has MORE THAN JUST BURGERS so I can eat too\u201d. In his defense I did say i\u2019d be fine with anything he made, I just figured he wouldn\u2019t make my least favorite thing on my birthday? I know that sounds childish but it\u2019s all the little things that make me think \u201cwow you really just don\u2019t give a flying f*** about me or listen to anything I ever say\u201d all these things are things he knows are a pet peeve. I tell him he\u2019s allowed to go out, allowed to play games, and do basically whatever he wants but all I ask for is a balance. Like for him to just spend an hour of actual quality time with me a day or just talking or something but he really can\u2019t even do that. His excuse is that we live together, and I tell him Okay yeah we do but that doesn\u2019t mean we spend time together? He\u2019s making me feel like the controlling one but I feel like asking for an hour of his time to just talk or cuddle or do anything together isn\u2019t that much of a reach? I didn\u2019t feel like asking him to not do literally everything we argue about on my birthday was that much of a reach either. But instead he tore me down, ignored me, and made everything for him. He even left to go see his friend for a couple hours on my bday yesterday and just left me to sit alone. It was extra sad this year because it\u2019s the first year I don\u2019t have my family and I was already depressed about that. So today I just woke up absolutely hating him. I made an effort to cheer up and spend time with him and got dressed up in his favorite outfit and took him to get coffee at a really nice place and talk but he stayed in a mood and sat on his phone the whole time. I just feel hopeless at this point. I even tried to initiate some \u201cfun stuff\u201d when we got home to get him in a better mood but he just wanted me to suck him off and nothing else and I\u2019m sick of it because I do it all the time with NOTHING in return. It all just feels so one sided. I feel like i\u2019m just a slave to him at this point. This rant sounds super childish and clustered I know but i\u2019m just currently sobbing and have nowhere else to turn and no one to talk to about this. I could really use some advice honestly. I can\u2019t even leave him because he has me back into a financial corner and essentially just takes all the money I earn so I can\u2019t afford to live somewhere else if I wanted to.. I just need help..\n\nTLDR: I\u2019m dating a narcissist and this is just a rant of the things he does that are making me feel hopeless and helpless.

I\u2019m not asking for advice. I\u2019m not doing this for pity. I\u2019m doing this selfishly because I am so goddamn tired of hearing that I\u2019m a liar and that I\u2019m being dramatic. There are things that I've undoubtedly forgotten. \n\r\nI mentioned previously that my abuser would get upset because I had male friends; It wasn\u2019t just men, it was women too. Throughout my relationship with him, when I made plans to hang out with a female friend, I had to lie. Or, I made sure he was busy, out of town, at practice, in class, or I lied and said I had to job hunt. I could never tell him that I wanted to see someone other than him. It became a fight. He would guilt me, start fights right before I left, tell me I was ditching him, and always without fail, he didn\u2019t like said friend. Much in the same vein as my best friend, he would shame for wanting to be friends with the person and would talk shit about them, belittle them. It took a lot of work to not have those same thoughts and beliefs that my abuser instilled in me about my own friends, they were sluts or whores. They weren\u2019t good people because they had slept with too many people.. When my friends were around him, he was horrible to them. So, I learned to lie and I lied often. \n\r\nHe wasn\u2019t just horrible to me, his family (minus his dad), or to my friends; he was like this to everyone. Did it phase me? Yes and no. I took necessary steps to maintain my autonomy (hahaha I kid), my independence (just kidding, he took that away with control, belittling words, and shame) and anything else was an excuse for him, his behavior, and his words. I was constantly asked for the first half of our relationship why we were together; he\u2019s such an asshole they said. \n\r\n\u201cHe just doesn\u2019t like people\u201d was the go to response. *MY* go to response. Notice how I don\u2019t claim acceptance of what I said, initially? Yeah, I still struggle. I have a hard time saying, I accomplished anything no matter how small and I minimize a crap load still, baby steps y\u2019all.. I had to distance myself from myself and limit liability, it\u2019s how I coped. That\u2019s not to say I distanced myself from and denied responsibility for my actions or things I said. \n\r\nI\u2019m rambling. Anyway. I took the necessary steps to make sure he interacted very little with the few friends I did have throughout the years.  I learned really quickly not to tell him things about my friends/friendships because it reinforced his beliefs about them. I refused to tell him personal information about myself that he could use against me. I also learned that maintaining friendships wasn\u2019t always worth the hassle of the inevitable fighting. \n\r\nMind you, I\u2019m about a year into this relationship. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Shoulda, coulda,  woulda. He controlled most aspects of my life at this point. I changed schools to be closer to him, to prove that he could trust me. Spent all my time with him; it was never enough according to him. I stopped talking to guys altogether, even his teammates unless he was around. I stopped hanging out with friends. I cut friends out of my life. I was careful about how I spoke to him, otherwise I was disrespectful, and rude. I apologized profusely for my short comings, changing myself to be acceptable in his eyes. I accepted any and all blame, even for his parts that he played, and not by choice. He was angry, the world was out to get him because people are inherently bad, was spiteful and vindictive, unapologetic, intimidating, aggressive, disrespectful, scary\u2026 but he never yelled.

Today I spent the day at home and I overheard my grandfather threatening my grandmother. She has very severe alzheimers and he is her primary carer. She speaks only Finnish now (her mothertongue) so it's hard to tell how lucid she is but clearly, not very, she does the same stuff over and over again and is constantly talking to herself and laughing so is not very aware of the world. I believe the incident happened because she was trying to move some of my stuff that was on the kitchen table. I was in my room with the door shut and I think my grandfather thought I was asleep. I heard him yelling at her to leave the stuff alone. Few minutes go by and I hear him yelling again so I take my headphones out to listen. Every few minutes it sounds like she forgets and goes to pick up the stuff again, until the fourth time I hear him say he's gonna go get his belt, and then that if she does it again he's gonna hit her very hard.   \n\n\nI'm totally spinning out. I have heard him get frustrated with her before but never in an abusive way. I also know that he would belt my mom and uncles when they were children so he is certainly capable of physical violence. I just genuinely thought that that behavior was because it was 50 years ago and people thought it was okay, I had no idea he was capable of that now. I also can't be sure if it's just a threat or if he really hits her as I have never seen any indication of this before. Obviously there's no way to tell as she can't even speak English, she's also 80 so her skin is discolored and it would be hard to know for sure if she ever had bruises. I'm very afraid for her and I have no idea what to do. Presumably, this can only get worse as he is angry with her forgetting and her Alzheimer's is only going to get worse. He is the only person who cares for her, he has nobody checking on her and our nearest relatives (my uncle's family) live two states away.  \n\n\nI'm afraid to call anyone since I have no proof, the victim can't back me up and he would certainly deny it. I'm thinking of telling my family but because I didn't actually witness any violence I have a feeling they will turn a blind eye to it and assume he was just threatening her verbally. I'm also afraid because if I turn on him I will have nowhere to stay in this city I just moved to and will be on the streets. This is all incredibly distressing and I really don't know what to do. I guess I'm more venting than asking for help but if anybody has advice please feel free to share it with me because I'm totally lost.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Please be warned that it talks about suicidal thoughts, molestation, panic attacks, and abuse.\n\n...........\n\nHi All.\n\nEarlier this year I had the opportunity to read my victim impact statement to my ex step-father who groomed and molested me as a teenager. I cannot express how life-changing that was for me. It took me 7+ to build up the courage to speak out against him and start a case against him. Immediately after his conviction and sentencing I felt a huge weight off my shoulders. I still do.\n\nEven though I feel better, I still have the urge to share my statement. I'll be honest, I'm not sure why. Maybe I'm venting, maybe it's healing, maybe I think if someone else sees this post it can help them in some way.... I don't know... but i feel convicted to share. Please forgive mistakes in my writing.\n\nIn the 7+ years it took me to speak out I watched a lot of Dr. Phil, Crime Watch Daily, Steve Wilkos, documentaries, etc., and I just wanted to say I gained strength from every person who said #metoo . Though I know it's impossible, I wish I could thank every one of those people personally. Just know, no matter how big or little you think your impact is, what your'e doing MATTERS.\n\nThank you &lt;3\n\n\\-CJT\n\np.s- He was sentenced to around 9 years in prison.\n\n.........\n\n**7/10/2019 VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENT**\n\nFirst off, I want to start by saying thank you to everyone who has been involved from the beginning of this case. You guys have all saved my life. Thank you.\n\nWriting this statement has been incredibly difficult. I have no idea how to accurately describe the huge impact the crimes of T.A.W has had on my life, but I will do my best. He took complete advantage of me as innocent child. I trusted him to be a good Christian man and step-father. He completely warped my views on sex, drugs, abuse, family, relationships, people, feelings, and facts. I was taught that being sexualized as a minor was normal, so I normalized many types of abuse for years.\n\nI\u2019ve blamed myself for the abuse. The constant shame, guilt, despair, and rage I\u2019ve felt has rendered my self-esteem and confidence virtually nonexistent. T taught me to not respect myself. I've degraded myself and let myself be degraded by others because someone who was supposed to be good dad to me was telling me that's what I was good for. I felt dirty and damaged. T taught me my sexuality was a tool. I've been in destructive exploitive relationships because of this.\n\nI feared men for a long time. I\u2019ve had to wonder if every guy I meet is a pedophile. I was uncomfortable to be around male members of my family because my sense of family and men was so warped. It's sad wondering if every guy I meet is a pervert or a pedophile. I constantly question their motives and actions. The paranoia makes me ashamed. I\u2019ve been afraid of men who share any physical trait of T\u2019s, including men with blue eyes, men with blonde hair, and men with goatees. I couldn\u2019t stand hearing T\u2019s name. Cologne that smelt like his triggered me. I didn\u2019t trust people who were strong in their faith because I always thought they had a secret sexual motive towards me. Having to be around people that reminded me of him was extremely uncomfortable. I remembered digging my nails into my skin, so I could focus on that physical pain instead of just staring at an innocent person with disgust.\n\nI've self-harmed trying to manifest my uncontrollable pain into something tangible I could see and control. I've self-harmed in attempt to quiet intrusive flashbacks. I've have relived the worst of the abuse in my head an unfathomable amount of times.\n\nT constantly put me in adult situations that made me feel uncomfortable. As a resulted I developed unhealthy behaviors as coping mechanisms.\n\nT took me to a sex shop in when I was 14. On his way there he was so impaired on marijuana and alcohol that he slammed the passenger side of his truck against a cement barrier on the road. I had to help turn the wheel to get us to stop scraping the truck. He originally said he brought me to the adult store to buy me marijuana, but in the process also forced me check out pornography, sex toys, and a wall FULL of photos of customers in the store having sex and using the products there. He and the owner of the shop tried to get me to look at multiple images of T having sex. I don\u2019t know what is sicker to me, that, or that he had me sit on a swing meant for sexual positions and encouraged me to find ways to enjoy it. I'll never forget the look on his face when the store owner was trying to force me to do different things in that swing. T was beaming. He looked proud of me.\n\nT was perverted, inappropriate, and invasive. There were incidents where he had checked my fingers and hands in extremely vomitous and violating ways to see I had touched myself in a sexual manner. Even though this happened to me when I was 12-14 the thought still embarrasses me and makes me sick.\n\nT introduced the world of drugs and alcohol to me at the age of 13. He showed me how to take shots of tequila and encouraged me to drink as much as the bottle as possible. During the times we drank together I have woken up in strange places, most times in puddles of my own vomit after drinking too heavily. T admitted to me on a few occasions he left me lying on the floor, passed out, and still puking. He also constantly gave and did pills with me like oxycodone, oxycontin, and Adderall. He\u2019s asked me to get pills for him from kids at my old high school so that he could focus on studying for his tests for college. He gave me my first razor blade and showed me how to cut up drugs and do a line. He has done shrooms with me and has even driven with me in the vehicle high on shrooms. T has given me the inhalants that were sold in a sex shop as sex enhancers.\n\nAfter I passed out from doing too many drugs or drinking too much alcohol with T, I remember that there were times I would wake up to him checking to see if I was sleeping or not. Hindsight is 20/20 and looking back I fully believe he was checking to see if I was passed out enough for him to sexually assault me, because I caught him doing it once before. Due to my experiences I believe 100% that he has raped me while I was passed out before. This invasive thought is wicked and disgustingly unbearable to me.\n\nHe gave my best friend marijuana, alcohol and inhalants. He manipulated her multiple times. I believe T was grooming her for abuse as well.\n\nHe contributed further to my abuse by helping me facilitate meeting with men much older than me. He encouraged me to become sexual with these men, not caring they were over the age of 18 and I as a child did not have consent to give. There\u2019s absolutely no doubt- he knew I was getting statutory raped by different men. My view on sex were so warped from T's abuse that I had no idea that I was even getting abused at the time. There are multiple incidents where this occurred, but an especially terrible example of this are the multiple times he willingly drove and delivered me to an isolated unlit dock by the river at midnight, knowing 100% for sure that 28yr old felon on parole for violent and drug offenses was there to meet with me, get me high, and have sex with me. Instead of acting reasonably and like a responsible parent, he constantly laughed and seemed impressed that a 14-year-old child had so much sexual control over adults. He would listen to my stories with a gleam in his eye, almost like he was listening to a fairytale. On top of getting statutory raped, I could have been murdered and thrown into the R. River with no one around to help me.\n\nOne of the most absolutely crushing things I must learn to cope with is the immense amount of pain T has caused both my mother and father. It breaks my heart to know that at one point he met my father, shook his hand, and promised to keep me safe like his own daughters. Knowing how much I loved my father, T would constantly tell me that if my dad ever found out what he was doing to me that my dad would kill him, and I would never be able to see my father again. He used the love I had for my dad against me. I can\u2019t even begin to describe how disgusted I am for my mother. I'm repulsed at the thought of T taking advantage her the way he has. In my opinion, only people capable of true evil can do that. It makes me physically sick.\n\nThe worst way I'm still dealing with the abuse is through constant graphic flashbacks and debilitating panic attacks. Along with depression and an anxiety disorder, I've been diagnosed with PTSD and have vividly relived the worst parts of the sexual abuse I suffered at the hands of T.W. During flashbacks I can still feel his mouth, tongue, hands, and penis on me. As you can imagine it\u2019s just unbearable. I've had terrible panic attacks for the past 4 years. I've spent much of my waking life avoiding reminders and triggers in any way I can. I've even gone as extreme as considering trying and forcing myself to change my sexuality so being around a male romantically didn't trigger me. I can\u2019t tell you how desperate and hopeless I felt in that moment. I felt insane trying to get the memories to go away. On the prettiest most perfect days in the world I have tried to decide the best ways to end my life. I couldn\u2019t even escape T in my dreams. Visions of him molesting me and trapping me played on repeat in my dreams, sometimes for weeks straight. In my everyday life I felt so damaged. I couldn\u2019t grasp true happiness. I felt like an outsider. I considered suicide so many times since I was 15 that I eventually thought of it as an inevitable. I honestly thought there was going to come a time where I couldn\u2019t escape the abuse anymore and I would have to end my own life. There were days and weeks where I didn't leave my room because my life felt so worthless. My panic attacks have been severe. I've thought on countless occasions that I was literally going to die, my thinking was so messed up I truly believed it. I\u2019ve gotten checked out by EMT's, paramedics, and have even gone to the hospital during extreme attacks. It ruined my life. It changed me as a person completely. The little bit of myself I had left died and I had to relearn how to live again. It's the toughest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do. It's hard for me to even talk about it. I'd be lying if I said I still don\u2019t get scared every time I feel myself getting anxious.\n\nMy pain is so enormous that everything in my life has somehow related back to being abused. The pain of what T did to me always overshadowed the pain of everything else in my life. I never got to grieve over deaths of people close to me. I\u2019ve never allowed myself that time to heal. I'm never been able to allow myself to accept that fact I've also been raped twice as an adult. I was so stuck in a never-ending flashback that it didn\u2019t matter what happened to me- nothing compared to the constant horror of remembering the feeling of me getting molested and abused daily. The pain is so intense I can feel it physically. There are times where it felt like my lungs would collapse and my chest would cave in from the anxiety. I felt like the pit in my stomach would open and consume me. I would vomit from the stress and anxiety or from crying so hard. I thought I could never live a happy or healthy life. I grew up always wanting to get married and have children. I won\u2019t have children now. Not for the lack of wanting to, but because I'm afraid someone like T will molest or rape them. That fear overwhelms me often.\n\nHe treated me like an adult. He often let me skip school, shop lift, and sneak out. For his kindness he would make me pick out porn for him and watch it with him nightly. T has touched my vagina and touched his penis to me more times than I can count. He has stuck his rancid tongue in my mouth as payment for him letting me do drugs and hang out with older boys and friends. He has forced me to drink and do drugs with him or he would blackmail me or make me life harder. He admitted he found a naked picture of me as a 14-year-old and used it for his own sexual gratification. There are times where I have wondered who else has seen that picture. I wonder if he\u2019s shared it with other predators before. I still wonder if that image is still floating out there on the internet somewhere. Once he said I made him feel like a pedophile because of his thoughts towards me and the things he was doing to me. He was expecting advice and comfort from the child he sexualized, groomed, and molested. T knew I was depressed and had suicidal thoughts as a teen but still made the choice to continue to molest me. He had no real concern for my life in any aspect.\n\n**Your Honor**, I ask that you give T.A.W the max amount of time allowable by law for his crimes. Without a doubt he is a genuine danger to society. Hes a manipulator who seeks power, control, and perverted sexual gratification wherever he goes. T.W lives 2 separate lives as 2 different people. He morphs into whoever he needs to be to exploit the situation. He gauges his audience and acts accordingly to gain trust. He puts himself in a position of power to have access to his victims. He is the scariest kind of predator because he\u2019s one that will infiltrate lives, make people trust him, and then strike. He is selfish, calculating and manipulative. He manipulated me and caused me to doubt myself and question my own sanity. I will suffer because of this for the rest of my life. It will never go away. I believe he will never stop hurting people. He will not change.\n\nYour honor, Thank You for giving me the opportunity to express the impact this case has had on my life. May I please address Mr. W directly?\n\n**T**\\- You and I both know the truth. Though you don\u2019t deserve the courtesy of me addressing you directly, I want to tell you a few things. When you stared me down during trial, in what I believe was a poor attempt to intimidate me\u2026That final action cemented everything I knew about you. I don\u2019t forgive you. I never will. It's not my job to. Jesus died for your sins, not me. Everything you've done is unforgivable. I will never forgive and forget. I will remember, and I will recover. I will never push intrusive thoughts out of my mind again. I'm going to deal with them because I\u2019m better than that and I am better than you. I deserve way more than what you have thrown my way. God only gave me one life to cherish and you dared to ruin it. You are selfish, sick, and take no accountability. You're a liar, manipulative, exploitative, and egocentric. You felt entitled to my body. You felt entitled to my mind. You victimized me. I want you to know that you don\u2019t own me, you don\u2019t have control over me, and what you did stopped haunting me the day you were found guilty. I'm free. No matter what happens from now on I'm going to be okay.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I read a few articles on Narcissism, but didn't really want to believe it until tonight. I called off work today because I was feeling so horrendously depressed about the situation. I have good days and bad, as most do after a break up, but everytime I get a message from her I almost panic, and stay in a state of distress for days afterwards.\n\nI'm not exactly sure why she treated me the way she did, or would say the things she said to me.. I started out being completely honest with her about everything, then was told to withhold certain things, and the then I was accused of being a liar?? \n\nAs the title says, I'm slowly coming to this conclusion. Listing a few things she would say (some on multiple occasions), usually in the heat of an argument and literally always under the influence of alcohol:\n\n-You don't make me happy at all\n-I don't want you, I should just get a sugar daddy\n-I have so many other options\n-Maybe you should just go home\n-I need space from you\n-I'm going to call my ex and have him beat your ass\n-All my exes want me back, all I have to do is call them\n\nThere was even a stint early on before all this crazy stuff started getting said that she planned to get back with her ex, that was an off and on relationship for almost 4 years, but decided against it because of how she was treated and her family would be super disappointed in her, probably to the point of not talking to her anymore. I found out about it and because she knew she was caught, she broke down and took her a while to be confident again. Or at least, I think.\n\nAfter speaking with some friends shortly before and after our break up, I was told that she is like this probably because it is a learned behavior, stemming from her exes and past abuses. More like she started acting the way they were as a coping mechanism to defend herself and now she subconsciously thinks this is how relationships are supposed to be.\n\nOver the time we spent together, I got so over being angry and belittled that I shut down and didn't talk to her for a day, and she suggested we break up. I agreed which blew her away. She went out that night, acted single. Talked to, danced with and made out with guys. Little did she know I had actually contemplated suicide the night I didn't talk to her, and told her a few days later when I was ready to try to sort things out. I knew it was over then, but she said she just wanted to be single and we would see how things went. I finally went full on NC almost a month ago. I know she still stalks my FB even though she deleted me.\n\nAlthough I miss her, i figure it was only a matter of time before she cheated on me. I always got the feeling that she has a lot of secrets, and that she likes the idea of entertaining men because of their attention for her and to get compliments.\n\nI know I am better off without someone like that. I just know that there will come a time she tries to contact me again after I moved on. Because I will get a surge of adrenaline when it happens, I really hope I don't lash out in anger. I know this will only feed into her game and I'll end up giving my power away, again. I had even questioned whether I was an N, to be honest.\n\nI know it will take time to heal from all of this, it just sucks that someone who I thought I would be with forever had put me in to this position. It really is partly my fault for trying to look past all the shitty parts and trying to hold on to something I sort of knew wasn't right.

I have a long history of anxiety and panic attacks and depression, however this never got diagnosed. My parents refused to believe anything was wrong with me or my brother when it came to mental health and we both went to them and told them we were depressed. They would always brush it off and say \"Oh no you arent, you are just being dramatic.\" However their response to any of our friends saying anything of the sort was \"I am so sorry, I hope you get the help you need.\"\n\nMy parents also were very psychologically manipulative and would always tell me i wouldnt be good enough, wouldnt let me do gymnastics or dance when I was in middle school because \"The other kids have been doing it since they were little kids so their going to be better than you\". They did this with every relationship and friendship of mine and any thing I was basically excited about and they still do now. I honestly dont know the last time I heard one of them say \"I'm proud of you.\" and thats something that I have needed to hear for a long time from them. \n\nI was cutting my wrist in high school and super depressed and constantly had suicidal thoughts in high school but they never helped me with it. This carried on through college and they even put a tracking app on my phone so they can always see where I am and wouldnt let me go anywhere with out checking with them first.

My parents were obviously pissed and said I was lying when I told them what happened so \"I could spend time with my boyfriend.\"\n\nI finally moved out a little over a year ago because one day while getting ready for work my hair was messy and my mom didnt like that.

The Nguy is in his 50s and I am early 20s, he is married with kids my age. Looking back I was charmed above and beyond, constantly showered with gifts, wine and dined, and he put me high up on a pedestal like I was a goddess. Coming from a place of very low self esteem I was hooked. \n\nThrough our relationship I started trusting him and opened up for the first time about childhood traumas and about my mom who I suspect is BPD. He has repeatedly said he has a Chronic case of 'white knight syndrome'. \n\nThings started becoming more high and low between us as of January when my mom found out about him and wanted the affair to end, but we both saw each other anyhow. When I went to break it off the first time and tell him it was time to end the affair, it was the first time he decided to tell me he loved me (love bomb). We had many fights and times of blind good times, but recently we had another big fight.\n\nI had confided in a friend about the Nguy, who is a mutual friend of ours, and told the friend he was manipulative, controlling and toxic to me, and that these ideas came from my therapist and basically no one else understood because he was only that way it seemed to me.

For example, today when i told him i needed my wisdom tooth and the tooth next to it to be exteacted, he raises his voice at me and said \"you should've seen a dentist when i told you to last year, now you're suffering because you didn't listen to me.\" And yesterday he hit my mom's laptop instead of calling her name to \"ask if she wanted some tea\", and when my mom said no (she already had a cup of tea in front of her) he just got the cup and poured the rest of the tea.\n\nThere are innumerable incidents just like these, like when he refused to come to a wedding with us because we were wearing \"short dresses\". Like the time when he didn't talk to any of us because we didn't want our photo to be taken during our Europe trip. Or like the time he didn't speak to me for a week because he fingered my birthday cake's frosting and i got a little upset because i wanted to take a photo of it before eating. Also, i'm not sure if this matters but my mom is his second wife. \n\nI'm trying to stay sane but in these conditions it's just hard, so hard. A part of me says what he's doing to me and my family in unacceptable, but the other part of me has unfortunately normalized it. Whenever i hear his footsteps or breathing sound, i get nervous. I don't want to live in fear anymore. \n\nI just want someone to say that i'm not acting spoiled. I just want to know that i'm not insane. Please tell me if what he's doing is emotional abuse or not.

I need to share my story and hopefully relate.", "author": "iagtgb1", "self_text": "I'm finally going to begin my journey towards getting better. I have always had a hard time discussing these issues and feel that they have come to take over my life. I'm taking it back. I just ended a bad ex relationship with someone who has their own issues. I ended it but tried being nice. It ruined my current relationship. I have to make things right for me.\n\nHere it goes.  \n\n\n1. I was sexually abused when I was around 4. A family friend who would babysit us had raped me along with other sexually abusive physical acts. I had no idea what was happening and randomly remembered it when I was around 18 and in the middle of my first serious relationship. It completely messed me up. I didn't know if it was real or not. I was constantly second guessing myself over it and eventually most things in life. I became so depressed and anxious. I remembered always having stomach aches which still continue to this day. I remembering being afraid to use the bathroom alone and would ask my mother to stand outside and talk to me. I finally told her a few years ago. That I couldn't even remember his face, but described the features that are kind of a blurred scattered face. She knew instantly and it turned out he committed suicide years later. \n\n2.  My dad was having an affair and I ended my parent's marriage. I was 5 years old and noticed my dad always leaving my brother and I to use a payphone. I heard him say he loved someone and I thought it was my mom so I asked to talk to her. I knew it was weird. He would also drive us to this house that is burned into memory. The brick facade, white iron railing... He would leave me and my crying hysterical older brother in the car while he did whatever he did. Sometimes hours. I told my mom and I don't remember anything between that and being at my grandmother's house halfway across the country. I didn't see or hear from my dad for years but he returned and ruined my mother's relationships. He wasn't my dad anymore. He was angry, addicted to painkillers and depressed. She can never forgive him and he will never forgive himself. They are still together. My mom let us see him and one day but he didn't come out. I went in where he was living as he never locked the door. He was on the floor and had an empty bottle of pills and wouldn't wake up. I don't remember what happened after that. I didn't see or hear from him in a while but remember in 4th grade when our teacher asked what we wanted for Christmas. I balled my eyes out and said I just want my dad back. He is bitter, angry, selfish and abusive to himself and everyone else. He never does anything for anyone unless he gets something back or will hold it over your head. \n\nThere's so much more detail but I'm just laying it out as it comes.\n\nSo, the bad stuff:\n\nI am so tired and confused all the time. I sleep irregularly, have constant stomach aches, bowel issues, anxiety, irregular rapid heart beat, jitters. Making decisions about plans longer than a few days away feels crippling because I never know how I will feel. It is a prison.\n\nI know I have abandonment issues. I find it so hard to trust people. I give myself up to them fully but I try leaving relationships whenever the smallest feeling arises where someone can leave me. I immediately regret it. \n\nI never feel appreciated, valued, understood or cared about. I will do anything for people and often find myself in bad relationships that I can't leave. \n\nI think of all I have to do in life and feels like I'm living day by day. Suicide feels like an option when I think of all I need to do. \n\nI've developed a really strong sense of empathy and find myself constantly supporting others and having them tell me that I understand them. I've had people become attached to me and like I was constantly a respite for all their problems while never asked of or considered mine. I never assessed this dynamic until recently.\n\nI feel guilty and ashamed a lot. \n\nDrinking calms me down.\n\nI feel alone in this.\n\nI'm scared nothing will change. Therapy won't teach me anything I don't know from CBT, concepts of control, and lots of philosophy.\n\nThe good: \n\nI appreciate life very seriously and never want anyone to hurt. I see life as fragile and do my best to appreciate and care for it. I even help insects, I garden and plant, I volunteer a lot.  I always help people when I see it needed.\n\nI don't have any hate for them. I wonder what they went through and how maybe they never had anyone to help them or were unable to help themselves. I am very understanding and forgiving while recognizing these to be fundamentally awful behaviors.  \n\n\nI understand this and know I can be better. I just don't want to be alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading and I had to get this all out while I wait for offices to open and start making calls for support.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

He would tell me I was harassing him and I would have to end up saying sorry to him in the end.\n- he would like specific single girls photos on Instagram, and if I asked who they were, he would flip out and say I can't ask him that.\n- when I had surgery and was in hospital for weeks, he had to be persuaded to come see me as \"it wasn't fun for him\"\n- he never wanted to talk about our future, ever. later when we broke up, he said it was he didn't want a future with me\n- he ran away from me in public on numerous occasions when he had drove us there\n\n- when I would come to stay at his, he would sleep until 4pm and act as if there was nothing wrong with wasting the day\n- when I was recovering from a broken ankle, he would constantly walk off in front of me, so I couldn't keep up\n- he disbelieved a lot of my allergies and would say \"nah you're not allergic to that\"\n- when staying at his mum's house, he would gang up on me with her, and  they would say things like I didn't have any manners, when I tried to be polite as possible\n- he would neglect to invite me along to parties or to things that required a plus one, because \"he'd have to give me all his attention\" when I'm quite independent by nature\n\nTheres quite a fair bit more, but hopefully you can get an idea.

A lot of people post and comment asking if what they did was \"wrong.\" Am I wrong for breaking NC? Am I wrong for wanting to talk to my Nex? Am I wrong for still feeling so bad? \n\nNO! NO! NO! Pump the brakes, y'all. Listen to yourself! Who do you sound like when you ask those questions? I'll tell you who I sounded like when I was asking myself the very same things. I sounded like my I was judging myself like NexW did! Narcissists love dichotomies (especially false ones). Polarizing things into \"right\" and \"wrong\" help them easily put you into the most convenient camp at the time. Obviously, their own actions are not subject to the same scrutiny, because they are just so complicated and nuanced and \"you just wouldn't understand even I told you.\" Right? You know what I am talking about.\n\nYou drop a glass and break it. Then they act like you just punted a baby. If they can convince you that your life is just one big sliding scale of right and wrong, you are so much easier to manipulate. When they want to guilt you into something you aren't comfortable with, it is as easy as moving that slider to the \"wrong\" side. \n\nI don't want to belabor that point, because I think it's pretty self evident once you realize it. We have to measure our actions though; it's what thinking minds do. So what would be a more helpful metric to judge our actions? I just gave you a hint. \n\n\"Helpfulness.\" What if you started looking at your actions as a spectrum of helpfulness for yourself and others. All the sudden are actions are based on a horizontal scale instead of a tiered one. Me thinking about breaking NC is about as helpful as me thinking about corgi puppies. They are just thoughts. One isn't \"worse\" than another; they just *are*. Rebounding on the first pretty face that you see isn't wrong per se, because some people have found themselves in happy relationships from that. Is it helpful for you though? \n\nIf you are judging your entire life as a balancing act of how right you can be, you are going to have a bad time because most people are wrong about most things most of the time. What if we strove harder to be more helpful than more correct? What would your life look like? I guarantee you would find more small victories in your life. When you start looking at even doing small tasks like eating your breakfast for the first time in weeks as \"helpful,\" every step you take becomes a form of therapy. Every breath is a moment of healing. Some parts of our healing will be smaller than others, but who here would say that small moments of healing are wrong? \n\nNot me.

It makes it so hard to process everything. I know I\u2019m not perfect and there were times where I was emotionally abusive. But deep down, I truly loved him - his happiness was so important to me, even if it meant not being in a relationship with me. Instead, his accusations and my own memories of my behaviors make me feel like I trapped him in a relationship and HE is actually the victim reacting to MY abuse. \n\nI\u2019m just so confused and scared that I was the root of the problem even if my intention was never to control or manipulate him (I would NEVER want to \u201ctrick\u201d someone into being with me, no matter how much I wanted to be with them). I guess I\u2019m just looking for an unbiased opinion\u2026there are so so many examples of blurred lines, but I guess these are the easiest to explain\n\ne.g. I was insecure in the relationship for a variety of reasons: a) he'd tell me everyone wanted to fuck him b) would tell me he\u2019d fuck our friends if we weren\u2019t together c) had a negative attitude towards monogamy and broke up wth me once over it (\u201ceveryone cheats on each other eventually\u201d) and d) cheated on his ex in the past and hiding it from her (which I only found out by accident and he gave me a million excuses for not telling me/cheating\u2026long story). \n\nSo when he\u2019d want space after a fight (which felt more like a silent treatment) or tell me he was depressed and wanted to be alone, but then go on social media and flirt with random girls and talking about how much he loved his internet friends, it really hurt my feelings. When I\u2019d try to talk with him about it, he\u2019d accuse me of being paranoid and having trust issues and being clingy. Which didn\u2019t feel accurate because that's just not the kind of person I am \u2013 my main concern was he wasn\u2019t happy being with me or would cheat on me because he was angry (which is why he cheated on his ex). He\u2019d say it\u2019s all in my head and he only wants to be with me, and if I can\u2019t trust him, we shouldn\u2019t be together. So I\u2019d drop it for a period of time, but the anxiety was still there and continued to build.\n\nEventually, my anxiety got the better of me one time so bad I logged into his Facebook account and found that he was private messaging this random girl who was TOTALLY trying to homewreck (questioned our relationship, which he didn\u2019t defend really, and tried to get him to move to South Korea with her to teach children). He wasn\u2019t openly dissing me, but he wasn\u2019t defending our relationship either.\n\nWhen I confronted him about it, he wasn\u2019t even mad that I logged into his Facebook. He actually laughed and thought it was cute which I thought was weird. Instead he told me he\u2019ll just never talk to girls anymore. I told him that wasn\u2019t the solution I wanted because that\u2019s unrealistic and unhealthy. That I just wanted us to communicate more and to understand if he really values monogamy as much as I did because a lot of his actions and behaviors indicate otherwise. He said polygamy is dumb and that it\u2019s normal for guys to stop having friends that are girls when in a relationship. I couldn\u2019t get him to budge so I dropped it. Of course, he used his solution against me when breaking up saying I controlled him and prevented him from having friends outside of our relationship.\n\nGod there are just so many others\u2026.Like him constantly picking fights with me to the point where I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He\u2019d say it was abusive because I wouldn\u2019t validate his feelings which made him scared of opening up to me. But he\u2019d be angry at me for things that I felt were truly ridiculous. For example, I had just been promoted internally at work, and because I was in-transition, I was juggling two roles at once. I had a particularly stressful day at work and when I got home, he ran up to me jumping up and down showing me a new poker kit he bought, and telling me he was going to teach me how to play poker that night. I told him that I had a long day at work and if we could maybe chill in the Jacuzzi that night instead and learn how to play poker over the weekend. He got angry and left the apartment without word. When I texted him asking where he went he said \u201cI was trying to build a common interest but whatever, I don\u2019t care anymore. You value work more than me because you\u2019re always so tired\u201d. I was pissed and exploded at him over text. When he finally came back to the apartment I told him that it really upset me that he would get so angry over me asking for a compromise and that his reaction felt unwarranted. He told me it was my tone and bad attitude that I need to work on and that I need to stop obsessing over work because they\u2019re using me. I don\u2019t remember exactly how I responded but I am pretty sure I resulted to name calling, saying I wanted to kill myself, or hitting myself\u2026part of it was feeling frustrated that I was always doing something wrong. Another part of me angry that he has this double standard for his career vs mine (his work takes priority over me because it \u201cdemands\u201d more of him)\n\nsee what I mean about my bad behavior making this so hard for me to process? I\u2019m so ashamed\u2026but all I wanted was to feel respected, valued, and loved. And I truly felt like I forced him to be with me for 8 years\u2026\n\nThoughts?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Nothing is what it\u2019s actually about in the world of a narcissist. \n\nSo, while you\u2019re trying to solve a problem, reach an understanding and a resolution, they\u2019re scheming and pulling the strings to achieve their \u201cwin\u201d, their domination of you, their control over your mind. You as a person do not exist in their equation, which also means that they do not care what happens to you in the process. Hurt feelings, damaged reputation, shattered life? All of no consequence. Because all that matters to a narcissist is what THEY want. They are basically morally and spiritually detached from other people and from life itself.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Warning: long\nFYI, I'm 18F. \nI cut my hair 4 months ago and my mother was so upset and angry, she refused to talk to me for a day. And when she finally did, all she said was that I look bad.

She uses every single information about me against me. I went with her to buy a required book for math and she keeps saying how much of a leech I am, taking up her time and spending her money. She does this with everything. She makes things up and antagonizes me. When I go out and ask if my outfit looks nice she says my hair is awful. She constantly calls me names (I don't know english words for those, but it sure enough includes cursing and these are very heavy words in my language). She is making me clean things up multiple times because \"it's still dirty/wet\" even when it clearly isn't. She acts like a moody teenager, throwing temper tantrums and then acting like she was attacked by me to make my father step in. My father is a whole another subject, but he beat me multiple times, destroyed all my past phones because he got angry, threw me out of the house in pjs during winter and so much more.

This forum hit home when I found it, and I really would like some reassurance that things will get better. I\u2019ve never really spoken to anyone who has gone through the same thing as me, but I\u2019m hopeful that it will help. So, I\u2019m going to share my story and see if anyone can relate or offer advice that has worked for them. \nI dated my NEX for a little over a year. He was my first boyfriend. At first, I didn\u2019t really notice the signs or anything. And then, I realized that everything I said to him was wrong if it didn\u2019t coincide with his own viewpoints. I could get over the little things, but when everything turned into a major argument, I couldn\u2019t handle it anymore. Eventually, the narcissism escalated into general emotional manipulation/abuse and threats of suicide and/or self harm anytime I attempted to leave him. Finally, once I did leave, he wrote me so many goodbye messages where he said it was all my fault if anything happened to him, and that he was the best thing I would ever experience and I was losing my soulmate. I felt so guilty and terrified that I would be alone for the rest of my life, so it took me forever to finally get him out of my life entirely. \nOnce I finally gave up on reasoning with him and blocked him, he messaged all of my friends and family members and told them that he would ruin my life unless I unblocked him. Most of my friends in turn blocked him or just laughed it off, which is what I did, too. How could he ruin my life? It was silly. But, then, he started messaging my mom. He told her all of the secrets I ever told him and all of the things I confided in him and had never said to another person. Then, when she started questioning her trust for me, her own daughter, he told her about his struggle with suicide and self harm. He reeled her into the same cycle he put me through. She would stay up all night texting him or talking to him on the phone to make sure he was okay. She would drive two hours away to go visit him and buy him groceries and take him shopping. Meanwhile, she ignored me and took his side of things. When I tried talking to her about him, she looked me in the eyes and told me I wasn\u2019t the person she raised me to be, and then walked away from me. To this day, I don\u2019t know exactly what he told her, but I can only guess how his side of things sound compared to the reality of the situation. After all, his side is the only one that matters in his eyes. \nThis was 2016-2017, and things have somewhat faded since then. She refuses to discuss any of this with me and still texts him occasionally, but not nearly to the extent she used to. Things have patched up between her and I since then, which is great, but I still don\u2019t believe I\u2019m fully recovered from him. Anytime I start getting close to a new boyfriend, I question his level of commitment and whether or not he does love me like how my NEX did. I find myself almost wanting to go back to my NEX just to see if I made a mistake by leaving, but then I remember all of the things he said and how he made me feel and I immediately just feel sick. This was two, almost three years ago; do things get better? I know things have slowly gotten better over time, but the deeper rooted problems still linger. Is it okay to still be questioning the level of commitment for those around me? I have a hard time trusting anyone now and can\u2019t believe that anyone will ever genuinely love me. It\u2019s awful to think that one person can have this strong of a negative effect on another.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

(WARNING LONG TEXT)", "author": "Adecentlylargeboy", "self_text": "Hello, I am in the midst of recovering from a heavy and toxic break up that happened about one week ago. My ex was my first girlfriend and we met while in film school - She was one year below me, and I was just initiating my final project which would determine whether or not I could land a job at a design company. She almost immediately from the get go was idealizing me, would refer to me as a genius - And just overall shower me with praise. She would talk badly about her other boyfriends and had expressed that she had cheated on all 3 of them and feared cheating on me - But would emphasize she has never loved any of them as much as me. The case before me was that she had cheated on her boyfriend with a 15 year old (we were both 21 years old).\n\nAlmost one month into the relationship she had already began talking about having children, and marriage, I told her directly the children idea made me uncomfortable but her marriage jokes continued throughout the relationship. In retrospect she wanted marriage because she is not a citizen of this country and had a limited visa. I recall her once claiming early on that I had ruined her life goals because I had explicitly mentioned I never wanted children both in this relationship and outside of it - I looked at her in utter confusion and told her to leave the room as I had to work on my final and did not need irrational drama. I would say she was always affectionate to the point of excess, she would shower me with literally hundreds of kisses (Sometimes in public) and on one occasion where she was in a bad mood and I tried to comfort her she refused to kiss me and told me to fuck off as a power play. I believe around this time was when her ex boyfriend warned me to steer clear of her - Which I ignored.\n\nA friend of hers who was jealous of our relationship slowly began to stalk me, and try to find us when he knew we were on dates near the school - The stalking got to the point that he would enter my classroom and show me his self harm scars which were a result of his supposed jealous. He was also beginning to send me passive aggressive messages on social media, and say I had to do an all nighter and explicitly told my ex I needed to work on my final undisturbed I would receive texts from both of them accusing me of ignoring her despite the serious implications and short time span I had to make my final project. Two months of this stalking occurred and reached a point where he was literally copying my final project and art style on Instagram.\n\nAnytime I voiced a complaint about his behavior, she would deflect and say \"Wow you got mad\" no matter how objectively I described what he was doing without judgement. Eventually she wanted to attend a party that he was going to - I warned her not to go because of his behavior and how I could tell he would try to persuade her sexually if they both became drunk. Well, the next morning I am told by her that in the middle of the night he had tried to touch her while she was sleeping (He touched her inner thigh) and on one of our first official dates later that evening where we noticed him following us - She then confessed to me that shortly before our relationship started she had slept with him. I was absolutely devastated that this information  was kept from me even amidst my confusion and her dismissing his creepy behavior that I did not need in the middle of my final.\n\nDespite her promising to stop engaging with him, they both kept speaking to one another - And on one night where I had enough and told her she had to talk to him in person and tell him to never speak to her again, I came outside 45 minutes later where they were chatting to find them both in a very long embrace outside, when she had promised she would be cold, direct, and brief with him. I also had later found out that any personal problems between her and I were being relayed to him directly - This guy who she knew I did not like.\n\nShe somehow convinced me to forgive her, and shortly after that spontaneously broke up with me one night a few weeks later which she later blamed on a manic episode. She begged me to take her back all night, complimenting me, sending me journals where she had written about how much she loved me, and drawings of us together (We are both good artists and at the time it seemed flattering enough to suck me back in). After all of this she finally admitted to it being horrible behavior how long she kept that other guy around, and how she had lied to me about their history despite me crying for the truth for months and her scolding me for being upset or deflecting. The coming months, I was slightly more distant emotionally and when I expressed a difficulty in rebuilding my trust with her after everything that happened early on, she would once again scold me and claim I was stuck in the past.\n\nThing were steady for a while, she had stopped speaking to this guy from the past. Until she met a former classmate of mine (Who let's just call jack) and I could immediately tell from his body language and enthusiasm towards her (Which he had never shown me) that he wanted to have sex with her. They immediately began texting non stop, and knowing her history I was suspicious but never vocalized it as I did not want to be the \"Controlling\" boyfriend. Her birthday comes around, and she is complaining about how horrible her birthday will be - Weeks before leading up to it. I try reassuring her that if she thinks her birthday will be terrible she is going to fulfill that prophecy. Her birthday arrives, and on the day of she complains all evening over nothing about how terrible of a time she is having despite my constant reassurance. I am taking her to various restaurant and after the 6th restaurant that she can't decide on and constant complaints - I finally just walk away from her.\n\nLater that night I see her post on her Instagram, her out having supper at a fine dine bar (with candles) and my former classmate Jack - Is tagged in the picture. I confront her about this the next day, and had already vocalized that I was not comfortable with her hanging around him (Which she just responded to by saying I did not trust her enough and was jealous). And I slowly let it go, however they continued to hang out despite my suspicions. One day she told me that he had been constantly inviting her over to his house, hinting at sexual intercourse. I told her that she needed to cut off contact with him immediately.  She continued to speak with him, and one night when he tracked her down at a club to supposedly try to convince her to come to his house - I gave her an ultimatum that she had to cut him off completely otherwise it looks as if she is tempted and he will continue to pursue her.\n\nShe reluctantly agreed, and blamed all of her behavior on the fact that her narcissist mother had never taught her boundaries. And this somehow garnered my sympathy enough to forgive her. I eventually graduate and move back to my hometown one month later. I discover that over long distance she had gone to a party where her new classmate had been attempting to sleep with her all night despite her rejections. But she somehow told me despite this she ate magic mushrooms where under the influence he continued to try to persuade her to start dating him despite her vocalizing that she was in a relationship. I tell her immediately to cut off contact with this guy due to her behavior, and she once again reluctantly agrees despite that fact his behavior was teetering on manipulation and sexual assault.\n\nA few weeks go by, and I discover that once again she is talking to Jack because he had supposedly been hugely apologetic to her and she wanted to give him a second chance. I tell her that she has to cut him off immediately otherwise the relationship is over. I call up Jack, and call him out on his behavior and he seems surprised as he was told they had just agreed to go shopping together. After that phone call, I break up with her on the phone for betraying my trust once again when I had established my boundaries. Months later, she contacts me and we begin speaking again. She is very apologetic and I confess I don't want to have a relationship with her. She begins praising me about how much of an impact I had on her life and how she just did not want to lose me as a friend - I reluctantly began to speak with her once again.\n\nShe slowly began sending subtly suggestive photos of herself (Not even nudes but sensual type images) and drawings of us together. Before I knew it, she had sucked me back into the long distance relationship. I discover that she is now in a band and has a circle of nice friends. I am very happy for her, and begin watching streams with her fellow band mates. I quickly notice that one of the band members was her classmate who I had warned her away from - And could tell from the way he looked at her legs and licked his lips (subtly) on stream that they had clearly had some physical history while her and I were broken up. I confront her about this and she becomes extremely defensive and claims that there is nothing between the two despite the obvious chemistry. I asked her why she had someone in her band who had tried to manipulate her to leave me, and pursued her knowing she was under the influence of drugs repeatedly. She calls me judgmental and gets angry at me for retreading the past. She even wants me when I visit to attend her band session with this guy there (Which I had expressed I was uncomfortable being around and did not want to go) and whined, had a tantrum and claimed I was unsupportive of her band for not wanting to attend when I saw her.\n\nI tell her that she must stop speaking to this guy, and she does. Come around to our one year anniversary a month later - And I receive a message from her in the middle of the night confessing that she had slept with someone for 300 Dollars and ecstasy - Which she proceeded to overdose on the same night. I am heartbroken, and ask her if she is okay, as well as whether or not she had cheated on anyone else (The guys I had been worried about in the past) and she goes \"Fuck no.\".\n\nShe begs me to forgive her, and resorts to her constant phrase of \"Are you ashamed of me\" while we converse over the phone. She tells me that If I move cities and move in with her, she promises to stop doing drugs. I tell her that this is manipulative and she needs to want to stop on her own, and that me moving in with her will not automatically stop her drug and serial cheating problems. I convince her the day after she overdoses to not drink (She said she was going to the liquor store). She continues to give brief \"I'm sorry\" apologies without much remorse or explanation and constantly redirects self hatred and says \"I'm disgusting\" \"Are you ashamed of me\" \"I'm sorry\" in such impersonal and selfish ways. She also said she would kill herself over what happened, and given her past depressive behavior and drug use - I believed her. \n\nThe day after this, I tell her I forgive her but don't want to peruse a relationship with her anymore, and I'm glad that I did not move in with her given her serial cheating and drug problems - She proceeds to say sorry but also emphasizes that she is sure she would not have cheated or continued drugs if I had moved in with her. Absolutely awestruck by her selfishness and hypothetical blame - I tell her that she needs to stop communicating with me. She proceeds to claim that none of this would have happened if \"We\" broke up the second time and started accusing me and asking me why I even got back together with her. She then says \"I need to change what I look for in a partner, but I can't change the fact that I get attracted to insane men\" She then proceeds to call me paranoid, accuses me of being insane for having a small social circle, and makes fun of my spiritual beliefs despite the fact she had just gotten a tarot reading. I cut off contact, and later that night receive a message from the drug dealer she had slept with.\n\nHe tells me that she had not told him we were in a relationship until after they had sex, and that she bragged about the people she had slept with that I was worried about in the relationship when her and I were temporarily broken up. He said she had no remorse, and that he she had indeed slept with not only jack (from her birthday) and the other guy from the party who was in her band that I told her to stay away from - Also she had slept with two other guys in her band stream which she had been begging me to attend and I would have not known she had slept with and had gotten mad at me for even being suspicious of, and who when she would complain about them being mean to her and I would defend them she would angry at me for criticizing in the slightest (In retrospect it's because she had fucked them and felt guilty about me pointing out their bad behavior towards her). I gave her one last phone call, and asked her to tell me the truth, and claimed that she had told me about the other guys I had worried about (When she absolutely did not) and basically said that I was a bad boyfriend for not putting up with her and that I was not a real man. She also went on to claim that I had hurt her just as much as her narcissistic mother. My narcissistic suspensions had now grown to the point that I sent her a variety of messages that clearly demonstrated her hoovering tactics, the idealize/devalue phases of the relationship, the erosion of boundaries - And she tried to claim I was manipulating her and was the narcissist for freaking out at her when I learnt the whole truth about the other guys.\n\nShe was so good at playing on my emotions, I feel used and disgusted that my first girlfriend did this to me. Despite all this she still has me somehow convinced it's me who was insane - Please someone if you have somehow read through this assure me that I was not the bad guy. I don't know what to believe any more, when I found out the truth and have been researching Narcissistic behaviors it all seems to make sense to me now. She also has bipolar, which I think is misdiagnosed and I know she was also a victim of childhood neglect and was always insecure - Am I correct in my assumptions? Where do I go from here? It's been about a week and I am so depressed I have chest pains and am physically ill. Please someone help me or point to me on how to recover from this.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

And I was also sort of finding out that I like boys and girls, and one day ended up watching homosexual pornography, and was masterbating to it. \n\nMy mother\u2019s then boyfriend (then got married) was staying at our home, because we were renting a home to skiing. I assumed he had gone off with my mother to ski, but he had not. He entered my room to ask for something (I think), and found me masterbating to obvious homosexuals. I left my door open because I genuinely did think I was alone. Or he actually may have come back? I don\u2019t know, to be honest.\n\nI was in shock and very afraid that he would judge me or especially tell my mother I am a (half) homosexual. But he told me it was okay, smiled very nicely, and soothed me before stroking my penis. He was a very attractive male actually, I was relieved that he wasn\u2019t angry, and obviously it felt good. I didn\u2019t resist so it was not rape, and after that he explained to me it did not hurt my mother, because it\u2019s homosexual and not women-man, but if I tell her she will be a silly woman and feel bad. I now realize that it was pedophile and cheating so do not worry. \n\nFor a the rest of that year we continued having light homosexual relations. We got along before and my mother was so happy we were getting along well. He told her we were playing video games in the basement, then we would kiss and sometimes do sexual acts. He\u2019d sometimes sneak such acts other times too. I enjoyed this relationship.\n\nThe next year, around Febuary, is when he first tried butthole sex. It hurt horribly because his penis was big and I was not only young but also small for my age. He used lubrication but it was so bad. I thought it was okay for me to be in so much pain because this is what boys like me experience, that\u2019s just how it is. I would often tell my mother that I feel off my bike and fell on my butt severely, it sometimes hurt so bad. We did butt sex maybe once or twice a month. \n\nWhen I was fourteen (almost fifteen though), I didn\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him anymore. I slowly became more and more guilty about it, and not wanting to experience the pain, but I finally tried to break it off with him. He pained me by hitting and punching me before hurtfully keeping me down, and unlubelessly butthole sexing me. He made me feel so guilty that our relationship continued for most of the rest of the year. He was a lot more violent with me then.\n\nOur relationship stopped when he was arrested for child pornography. My mother was heartbroken. I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her anything, she didn\u2019t find out until earlier this year, when I told my therapist (I go to her for fear disorder and depression) I\u2019m pretty sure this goes against the rules but she told my mother anyway. It made my mother feel very bad. \n\nI have a girlfriend now, we have been friends for a very long time, but she confessed that she liked me almost a year ago. I was very hesitant because I couldn\u2019t help but associate romance with my step father. I eventually said yes but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to disclose why. I\u2019ve loved her for years but I felt like it would be dishonest while I\u2019m in a homosexual relationship, then because I felt unready. My therapist didn\u2019t think I was ready for a relationship then, but I said yes anyway. \n\nI\u2019ve somewhat gotten over myself to be able to kiss and hug her, but not often or lengthily. She thinks it\u2019s because of my social fear disorder and tries to go slowly when it\u2019s actually because of him. A few days ago we were drinking and she sat on my lap and kissed me there. I don\u2019t know why but it gave me such a horrible flashback to him, maybe because it is a dominating position. I had one of the worst panic attacks I\u2019ve had in a long time. She was so sorry it broke my heart. I often thought about sex with her, masterbated to her, thought about kissing her, everything. But when the moment comes, I can\u2019t.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I should tell her why or not. I don\u2019t know how I can write the story in a way that doesn\u2019t include that I\u2019m half homosexual, and she might hate me for having homosexual sex in the first place, and especially liking it at first. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m writing this at an unfortunate hour for those overseas, I started writing this in the morning, and am now finishing up in my school bathroom. I know a lot of people overseas are homosexuals, or have sympathy for them, so I thought this would be a good place to ask for help. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if I made English mistakes or any other mistakes, I\u2019m trying to be formal but my mind is distressed.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

It happened right after the discard, which some of you know that feels like literal hell it's like a detox and I didn't take it well at all I started hallucinating him, he was telling me he wanted me forever. I got really really bad and suicidal I was not in the right state of mind at all. I didn't get it just the day before he had promised me we would make it. It was honestly the worst time of my life I wasn't able to sleep or eat for like a week. Anyways he took advantage of my state and said \"Would you do absolutely anything to get me back?\" \"Show me how much you want me\" \"I'll give you another chance if you make me feel good\" and I ended up sending him some nudes of stuff I wasn't comfortable with I remember crying during it. I developed PTSD because of this. Surprisingly enough this wasn't the worst part nox the worst part was when I confronted him about it he said \"Sexual abuse yeah right you mean wanting to please me using it to get another chance?\" and \"I have to apologize when you're too stubborn to see that it wasn't abuse\" I think for the first time then I *fully* saw who he really was I had seen little cracks before but this was the monster he really is and I was scared.

All the lies, manipulation, deceit, tearing me down, witholding affection, and domestic violence...POOF it's all gone from her narrative. \n\nThe first weeks were the hardest in a myriad of ways. Adjusting to this new norm, the days being bed-locked in depression, missing my children when they were away, and everything in between. \n\nWhat made it worse was catching wind of the STBXW's narrative and how she painted things to our mutual friends. \n\n\"I'm just sharing MY truth\" she'd callously remark when I'd call her out on her lies, cherry-picked half truths, and outright slander. \n\nThings like telling her friends she \"feared for her life\" (when she was the one with a decade long history of domestic violence and had even been arrested for this as the relationship finally fell apart)\n\nOr telling them how I \"moved on so fast\" bc I talked to a few new women...while forgetting to tell them she pushed for an open marriage or that she had a lesbian crush she pursued full force the last year. All the while I begged to not go that route and try to rekindle our relationship that was falling apart faster and faster. Instead she would come back how she was \"such a free spirited \ud83c\udf08\ud83e\udd84\" and I couldn't expect her to change or try and tame her. Or how I was wrong to not let her fully explore her new feelings for her lesbian crush/TA in her college class or question why she suddenly would be gone 3-5 nights a week till 10/11pm or later.\n\nI didn't really care after the initial shock... whatever friends want to believe her manipulative tactics can keep her. History has proven the truth will eventually reveal itself.\n\nShe finally admitted to having a few people she had talked to since the divorce initiated. However, her revelation painted a very different picture on the way things played out a few weeks ago. \n\nShe had missed her psych apt and bitched to me how they still charged her. She was pissed from the first meeting bc they told her she needed to get off Adderall (she was taking 60-80 mg daily) and it was clear she didn't want the help she claimed she did as the divorce was about to be initiated.\n\nAs usual, a few days later, the master of manipulation had me pick up her slack and take care of our kids on her day so she \"could meet up with my counselor.\"\n\nThat part was true-ish...\n\nTurns out she was meeting with her college counselor (she went back to finish her degree last year after a long hiatus) but had me thinking it was the psych. Apt being rescheduled. After that, I let her be and checked in after many hours had passed. She said she was at the mall with a friend. \n\nShe came back with a new wardrobe and prancing around with her ass and tits hanging out. \n\nAt this point, I had already paid $1000's in her bills she refused to put in her name...while repeatedly threatening me with legal action if I moved her personal bills into her name and new bank account. I kept pleading with her that she was not only screwing me over, but it was robbing from the kids as I was getting to where I couldn't even afford groceries and other stuff for them. All the while she had over $2,500 in her new account and was blowing money on clothes, new headphones, going out, etc.\n\nWhen she got back that afternoon from the counselor and the mall, I tried to calmly talk about her paying me back. She instantly got heated and I recognized the conversation was not going to go in the right direction. Instead of dragging it out, I said, \"Clearly we need a timeout, we can discuss this again later. I'll go for now and give you space.\"\n\nI was sweaty and stinky from cleaning and doing yard work all day after teaching, so I went inside to grab some clothes. Before I knew it, she was calling me as she was halfway out the driveway. Not even home for 15 minutes and had barely spoken to our children, she was rushing off to somewhere...\n\nI let her know that she needed to at least tell the children goodnight.\n\nShe pulled back in and went outside for a few cigarettes. During that time I grabbed a change of clothes and went to my car to leave. She heard the car start and frantically stormed from the backyard, slammed the gate open and rushed to my car yelling at me. She ripped my booksack from my car and immediately started slamming it against the concrete driveway. I pleaded for her to stop as my MacBook Pro was in there along with all my stuff for school (I'm a high school teacher) \n\nShe kept slamming it.\n\nSo much so that the zippers all opened up and everything was already between our vehicles. I kept begging her to stop and saying my laptop was in there. When she saw it fly out she picked it up and started slamming it on the driveway. Needless to say, it cracked the screen and broke the entire computer. \n\nShe had no remorse and blamed it on me. \n\nAfter that I jetted off to stay with family for the night. \n\nAfter a while she pleaded I come back and have sex (always her tactic to lure me back)\n\nFast forward to this week...when she admitted to seeing someone else after divorce initiated. \n\nShe kept telling me not to judge her and this and that... Says she \"may or may not have gotten a Mani/pedi\" and other details.\n \nTurns out she met someone at a bar earlier that week who was in town out of state working off shore. They added each other on FB and talked all week about their divorces, the guy offered to make her a business partner in his new venture, treated her to a Mani/pedi and let her drive his Corvette. She said she felt bad for \"hoeing myself out for that and using him\" but the reality is she always finds ways to use others.\n\nI didn't mind the fact she went on a date till she sent me the pic in front of his Corvette.\n\nThe same outfit she was wearing when she showed up after the \"counselor\" meeting with her ass and tits hanging out. Turns out she had been with him that day, and before smashing my laptop and going crazy, had plans to go to dinner with him. That's why she was leaving so fast and not even telling the children goodbye who hadn't seen her all day.\n\nI thanked her for her honesty (although I had a strong vibe she was still lying when she said \"nothing happened\" and \"she was only using him for his money. \n\nBut when the events all clicked, the real thanks I gave her was for helping me finally sever the last remaining threads I had stopping me from moving on.\n\nAt this point, sad as it is to admit it, when she'd offer sex or try to sneak over to the house, I would oblige. I was horny and it was easier than chasing new women.\n\nBut after that, I didn't have the desire anymore.\n\nShe prides herself on her looks, fake tits, and her master-of-seduction level ability to siphon me back in...usually with hidden ulterior motives my horny mind is too blind to catch on to. \n\nJust before her revelation about the date, I found myself playfully chatting with her that day...even missing her and telling her that. We knew we were done but also I kept holding on to this idea of what \"was\" but never truly was at the same time. \n\nYesterday, our son was sick and she begged to be able to stay at our house with them. It was her days with the kids and she didn't want to drive 30 miles to her new place. I caved thinking it was best for the kids, gave them space, and wanted to go see a movie. It was my free night after all. \n\nShe starts going through the small amount of groceries I was able to afford for their upcoming days with me, cooking it all and eventually leaving it out till I had to go behind her and put it all away. She tried to give me a laundry list of reasons she is struggling and has so much on her plate, and how she needed to use my supplies to work on a painting for her college class.\n\nI just let her be, and worked on my own stuff.\n\nShe made a comment, \"It's funny how we can talk all day on the phone but can't say a word to each other in person.\"\n\nThat's when it clicked...I was still hooked on this idea of who I thought she was...that version that is playful and easy to reminisce with and talk dirty to and all that...but the moment we actually are face to face, the reality can't be hidden.\n\nIt helped me know that I have to let go. Fully let go.\n\nWhat once \"was\" never actually was...and it never will be.\n\nTL:DR - Wife's narcissistic manipulative seductive alluring behaviors kept having power over me, even as I tried to move on.

If you're having a bad day, maybe don't read the following; you may find it triggering too. \n\nI read an article on PsychologyToday about \"personality disorders\" and \"relationship conflict\". I usually love Psychology Today, but this article really got to me. It almost seemed like they were trying to avoid covering NPD/abuse (while simultaneously using the article as blanket coverage for all personality disorders), and their FB post featuring it went so far as to insinuate that what all those with personality disorders need is a \"supportive partner\", and that they have a hard time finding this because their attachment anxiety pushes their partner away. The article states (literally): \n\n&gt;**To sum up,** this study of attachment styles and relationship in people with personality disorders suggests there is a downward spiral that can lead people already insecurely attached to receive less rather than more support from their partners.\n\nTo clarify, the person in the above scenario receiving \"less support\" is the disordered person. \n\nThis was another really big one that caused me to ruminate: \n\n&gt;People with personality disorders, then, are likely to form relationships with partners who share their level of severity. As a result, they might lose out on the opportunity to benefit from having a partner who can provide them with the type of supportive feedback that could help them overcome their attachment difficulties.\n\nI don't know what to say other than this totally ripped the rug out from under me. There are so many other things about this article that cause me to ruminate, but the above two quotes sum up the message. I spent 8 years trying my absolute hardest to be as supportive as possible. I jumped through so many hoops, minimized my own needs, supported and accommodated him even when I was at my wits end with the jealousy and suspicion and accusations and crazy making. I walked into the relationship healthy/securely attached/confident and most of the way through a path to healing from my childhood and walked out more anxious and easily triggered and untrusting of myself than I've ever been in my life. When I broke up with my ex, I kept telling myself, *I've blamed myself for 8 years, tried endlessly to be better, more supportive, more accommodating, and it has gotten me nowhere. If all of my efforts to change have not worked, it can't be my problem. It has to be him.* As a result of my habitual self-blame, rumination/blaming myself are the two biggest issues I have moving forward. \n\nThe rumination was reinforced yesterday when I tried to talk to my little brother about the fact that I'm ruminating, and he told me that in all of the time he's listened to me talk about this, it sounded like I had conflicting views of myself in my head. \"On the one hand you'll go on these long tangents where you just shit all over him for sometimes up to an hour, and then you'll turn around and tell me you're worried you were the problem. Who are you trying to convince? Me or *you*? If everything you're saying is true, what makes you feel like you were the problem?\" \n\nThen, I parroted what my ex always told me: \"I'm narcissistic, domineering, don't accommodate people, don't care about other peoples' needs, only care about fame, etc.\" I thought that my tone had been sarcastic enough for him to pick up that I was repeating what my ex had told me, but apparently not since he basically said, \"I mean, okay, I can see all that.\" He backpedaled when I told him that I was repeating what my ex had said about/to me and I acted like it was okay and I wasn't bothered by it, but I was panicking internally. I just tried to explain why I don't trust myself and what my ex did to make me dependent on his opinion/narrative of reality. He said he understood, but the trigger was already pulled. I went to sleep last night ruminating even worse and woke up this morning in the exact same headspace. I've been pulled back to all of the times that friends have said, \"It doesn't matter who's fault it was; it was toxic and you got out of it,\" and \"relationships are comprised of two people; you have to recognize where you were toxic too\". I loved (and still love) my ex and would have done almost anything to keep him if it hadn't meant completely destroying myself; I feel like I \\*did\\* try everything, and even did destroy myself in the process. That wasn't even enough. \n\nI feel insane again. I'm blaming myself again. I feel like I was the problem. I rationally know I wasn't, and I'm trying so hard to remind myself of all the thinking traps I'm falling into, but I just feel pure panic.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I won\u2019t go into too many details, but we broke off being friends more times than I can count, and every time she would come back and want to eventually be friends again. And I\u2019d let her in every time thinking it would be different. \n\nFinally, she broke off with me a few years ago and didn\u2019t reappear till two years later.  Apologizing, but also still holding me accountable for actions she claimed as toxic. (Which mostly accounted for passive aggressive behavior I do take blame for, and am not proud of, but was in response to my waning trust in her) She simply wanted closure and I did as well. Essentially we reconnected and it really seemed therapy and meds had substantially helped her admit to faults she was never able to before. \n\nThings were going good until one day she mentions a former sexual abuser of her's in casual conversation between us about our individual sex lives. (This happening all through text) My mind goes blank and I remember two instances that happened 3-5 years ago, but she tells me this was far more recent. I start panicking thinking it might be someone I know. She fills in details and then I instantly remember, but when that happens she immediately snaps at me. \n  She erupts in absolute fury, blaming me for everything.  From the fact I\u2019m the source of all toxic behavior amongst her former friends, to my womanhood being less valid than her. Not wanting to fight and fuel the fire, I apologized saying even though I forgot for a moment it doesn\u2019t make that experience any less traumatic or myself any less sympathetic to what happened. We haven\u2019t spoken since, but I don\u2019t want her back in my life. She\u2019s caused me a ton of grief. \n\nThere\u2019s tons more details here but I tried to compress this as much as I could.

I met a guy 2 years ago. I will call him \"S\". We dated for a few months, but I saw a lot of red flags. I broke up with him. Two weeks later, I found out I was pregnant with his child. We tried to make it work for awhile, but I broke up with him again because, again, the red flags continued, including drugs and drinking problems, anger issues, and instability on his part. I didn't want to be stuck in a toxic relationship with a baby in tow. He was enraged when I left him the second time, because he said he always wanted a family with me. \n\nI moved in with my mom and had my baby, who is now 10 months old and is my whole world. \"S\" was in the room when I had our son and even drove us home from the hospital to my mom's house. He got some advice from friends and therapists and he finally calmed the hell down so we could be like a family. I was just grateful for our wacky version of a family. But it continued to be an emotional rollercoaster, with him being emotionally abusive. He would call me names (stupid, piece of shit, loser), tell me I have no friends, and accuse me of cheating when I literally had no life outside of him and our son. These things depressed me, but my son has kept me sane and happy. \n\nDespite our issues, I decided we could try to rectify and my son and I moved into his house 2 months ago. We continued to have a lot of issues, but I have always stuck through and figured it was better that we are all together and maybe eventually therapy will fix everything. But he still had bouts of anger, and was clearly hiding things from me, sometimes even locking me out of rooms, and going out to bikini bars regularly.\n\nLast week I found out that not only did he sleep with his ex-girlfriend right before my son and I moved in with him, but now she is expecting a child.\n\nI feel completely hopeless. He admits he fucked up, but also tries to convince me how the things I did to him (break up with him when I was pregnant) are just as bad.\n\nHow am I supposed to go forward? Our son is close with his family and now I fear my whole family will be replaced with a new family, I do plan to move out, but I am financially strained. He was always late paying me back for our son's expenses, and now he has a second child to support. I never thought I would be in such a Jerry Springer situation. I just need help so badly. I am scheduled to see a psychiatrist and talk about medication. I never thought I would need medication. Please, if anyone can relate, please help me.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

{"post_id": "d2x9eb", "created_utc": 1568236989, "title": "Defeated a Snake", "author": "gohanvcell", "self_text": "So for those who don't know the full story here it is (copied from another post I made):\n\n\"So I met this new guy who joined our lab this Spring. He quickly but gradually began praising me a lot, for running my own studies and being in grad school. He is constantly praising me about it in a way that I find excessive and sometimes unwarranted. \nFor example, he recently told me he has told everyone in his family and also his girlfriend about how awesome I am and how much I have helped him out, when in reality I just gave in a good word for him to our professor. \nHe got in the lab, and the professor emailed us about our schedules for the semester. Everyone save for him replied, and my professor got exasperated and thought that I just dragged him into the lab. I explained to the professor that I didn't drag him, that he told me, repeatedly, about how he wants to do all this research and help out and go to grad school. He has said this repeatedly yet he never answered the professor's emails. \nHe called me recently and he exaplined why: he says he doesn't check his email often, and went ahead and gave me a sob story about how he suffered from depression and mania, and how he has progressed so much thanks to his dad and meditation. He then went ahead and praised me so much. I was just giggling as he was flattering me because it just seems so fake and suspicious. What really made me think this person is likely a narc who will later want to ask something from me is that he began saying how much we have in common, like our humor and way of thinking. He also has said this before, and also how much we connect and how close we are, even though he joined our group in March and I have not met with him extensively. I trained him and all, and we would talk, but that early he was already flattering and basically claiming we are so close. \nHe keeps saying I am welcome to go to his house to play pool or have a bbq. \nAnother thing is that he keeps emphasizing his honesty and his no bs attitude. \nAnother thing I realized is that he actually has no friends. I asked him yesterday and he said that people judge him as a douchebag or some kind of arrogant asshole, but that once people know him they like him. \nI am very suspicious and I am not sure those compliments are genuine. \n\nTL:DR This person is flattering me excessively and/or when it is unwarranted or disproportionately, overemphasizes his honesty and alleged hard working nature when so far he has not shown it in a significant way, all his family and his gf apparently know about how awesome I am, and he says we are very close and we connect so well when I barely know anything about him. \n\nWhat do you all think? Please share. For now I am keeping distance and also a very close eye on him. Also, I am a male too and I have a girlfriend, this relationship with this likely narc is purely platonic. Just to be clear.\"\n\nJust as I and others predicted, this individual is a narc. The professor told me it was ok for me to ignore him as he never answered emails. The only email the narc answered from the professor was because I told him to. I also trained the narc on every aspect of the lab. \nSo he sends an email basically apologizing for not  being professional and taking care of stuff as he should have. Here is the email text for all to see:\n\n\"Hey [insert OP name/username] I just wanted to reach out to you in an email, I tried texting you last night but I figured you were asleep.\u00a0 If I am already discarded by the professor becuase of the way I conducted myself, I completely understand man. I truly do appreciate everything you have done to help me, but I know I wasn't professional in doing my job right away and taking care of the time slots. Best of luck with your endeavors bro, have a great day.\"\n\nSo I ignore it because the professor and myself knew he was full of it. A day later, he sends this:\n\n\"Hello professor, I have tried reaching out to [insert OP's name] numerous times to schedule my time slots but never actually received clear and concise instructions. [Insert OP'name], I have noticed that I am no longer in your group chats for lab, along with helping you with your thesis. I am sorry for not reaching out to you all as quickly as I should have. All I am asking for is another chance to assist, sorry for everything and I hope I can do something to make it up and prove that I am an asset, not a liability. Thank you for your time, have a good evening.\" \n\nKeep in mind this: I not only trained the guy on how to run the experiment, I also gave him a step-by-step guide with images on how to create the slots, instructed him numerous times to coordinate with the other RAs, and even called him to ask if he understood the instructions to which he said yes. \n\nHere is my response:\n\n\n\n\"Hello Dr. X\n\n\nBased in the emails below, I demonstrated to [Narc] in a detailed fashion how to set up sessions on SONA. We also called as you can see in the email below and I asked [Narc] if he was ready, to which he answered me yes, that it was straightforward. The emails below should be ample evidence that [Narc] claims to the effect of me never giving him instructions for SONA are patently false.\u00a0\n\n\nBecause you instructed me to let [Narc] go, I did not reply to the following email:\n\n\n'Hey [OP] I just wanted to reach out to you in an email, I tried texting you last night but I figured you were asleep.\u00a0 If I am already discarded by the professor becuase of the way I conducted myself, I completely understand man. I truly do appreciate everything you have done to help me,\u00a0but I know I wasn't professional in doing my job right away and taking care of the time slots.\u00a0Best of luck with your endeavors bro, have a great day.'\n\n\nThis is [Narc] email. [Narc], which one is it? Were you unprofessional, or did I not give you instructions? Based on the evidence, it seems like the latter is incorrect.\u00a0\n\n\nFurthermore, here are screenshots of [Narc] and I texting about calling on those dates attached.\u00a0\n\n\nI am very troubled by [Narc] flippant lying about me not providing instructions, and this speaks tons about his character and integrity, which is not positive.\u00a0\n\n\n[Narc], please refrain from emailing me again. I am not interested in having you in my [sic] study. If Dr. X decides to have you in his team, that is his decision.\n\n\nDr. X, I apologize for all of this trouble.\"\n\nThe narc then replies: \n\n\"Hey [OP] thank you for everything you have done for me, I will make sure to make a complaint about you and your 'professional standards' to the office of academic success. Hey funny thing, don't you work there? See you tomorrow. Have a safe night. Good bye\"\n\nI just ignored him and my professor reminded me to just let him go away and that we are not to play that game. I gave the professor a call and he reassured me that he was fine. Today at work, narc never appeared, confirming my suspicions that he was full of hot air. My boss knows about him too, and she and I laughed at the nar's failure to stay in the lab and leech off of me. \n\nThe fact that he replied rather quickly to these emails further proves that his excuses for not answering the professor's important emails are pure and unadulterated bs. \n\nI am glad of being rid of that narc.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He hurt me so much!!\" And before the dream ended, I was told \"Well, did you ever consider that you had fault in that?\" To which I snapped, upset \"The first thing I did was blame myself.

This is an incredible community and I\u2019m so glad I found it. \n\nSo, I finally had my court hearing for the restraining order I put in. He ended up showing up - something I really didn\u2019t expect. Of course over the course of the hearing I figured out he only showed up to intimidate/scare me and to discredit what I wrote in my declaration. I couldn\u2019t believe some of the things he said. I mean, I could believe it because he\u2019s a scumbag and he\u2019s said some of the most horrible things to me before. I guess I just couldn\u2019t believe he would do it in front of a whole audience. \n\nHe was obviously lying and I guess everyone could see right thru it, especially considering he had no evidence to back any of his claims. It was one of the most intense moments of my life and also very sad. I pitied him. \n\nHe kept saying he loved me regardless and that he wanted to be there for his baby\u2019s birth. In the end, I know the whole \u201cI love you\u201d bit was to get me to bend to his will and retract. Of course he doesn\u2019t love me. What I\u2019ve done is betrayal to him and the punishment would be getting my face beat to a pulp and being humiliated. \n\nOh, I also found out his whole \u201clooking for a better life for us as a family\u201d bit was a total lie. He lied to me about everything. I have no idea what he was doing in the other state we were going to \u201crelocate\u201d to and I have to make peace with never knowing what he was doing and who he was with while he was away. It angers me that I paid for his damn plane ticket to leave and that he successfully manipulated me into sending him money while he was over there. It was always the same fucking story with him. \u201cI don\u2019t have money\u201d and then out of nowhere he had money. He never paid for anything prenatal....nothing ever regarding the baby. \n\nFor the past week I have struggled with the thought that him not being able to attend his baby\u2019s birth and not being a part of our lives is something cruel. Everyone tells me it\u2019s not - it is the consequence to his violence and lack of remorse. I\u2019m doing it for my baby\u2019s safety and my own. And that of course his misogyny and malignant narcissism would result in damaging an innocent baby - something I truly want to avoid. \n\nWell, the good thing is I have been successful in staying NC for a whole month now. The restraining order was approved and he has to stay away for the next 3 years. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m being mean, because I feel that he is lonely, but then I remember the things he said in court and everything else - the physical, sexual, emotional and financial abuse - the lying - everything! It was unbelievable. I guess I just wanted to share this and say that it\u2019s so hard, but I\u2019m determined to keep going forward. \n\nThanks for reading.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I eventually told my parents about what had been happening, and we had to go to trial, and the guy didn't get convicted.\n\nA few years ago, I started doing stand up comedy about my experience, and it profoundly affected my outlook on it. Laughing about it allowed me to start having conversations with my family and friends about what had happened, and made the whole thing easier/more manageable to process.\n\nI recently put out a molestation stand up set on YouTube, and since posting it, a lot of people have reached out saying that they'd also been molested, or something similar happened to them. 3 people have said it was their first time ever telling anyone about it. I couldn't be happier that others are getting similar benefits from laughing about it. Here's the link if you'd like to check it out: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaxoR4PeH64&amp;t=14s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaxoR4PeH64&amp;t=14s)\n\nI also started a Podcast called \"What happened to you?\". Trying to start dialogues about difficult topics. In the first episode I talk about my experience. And the second episode is with a friend of mine who's parents both committed suicide when he was a kid. I've also started a YouTube channel talking about molestation related events in the world (Michael Jackson, for example). I think our best defense against this stuff is to start talking about it openly, which many people are reluctant to do (understandably so - molestation isn't exactly a topic you bring up at dinner). I know that neither kids nor adults know enough about it and what to look out for. When I was getting molested, I didn't know what molestation was. So I'm hoping to start talking more about it, potential defenses against it, resources for those who have been through it, anything really. The more we talk about these things the better.\n\nWishing you all the best in your recovery and in life :)\n\nSebastian\n\nPodcast link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-tn\\_PwYmT4&amp;t=150s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-tn_PwYmT4&amp;t=150s) also available on iTunes and Spotify\n\nYouTube Channel: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3VPKJNmOV9NzlfMi5yR6Gw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3VPKJNmOV9NzlfMi5yR6Gw)", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I've put her on a roller-coaster, being loving and caring one minute, and cold and distant the next. I'm a workaholic and I frequently put work first, making her feel unloved and unwanted. When I put her first, it always felt like I was sacrificing my potential success, and I made her feel it. I treated her like an obstacle to my success and happiness, but any time she threatened to leave I'd think about all the happy memories we shared and I'd feel devastated to lose her. I'd instantly become more emotionally engaged, making her things, taking care of her, spending time with her. For a while we'd be happy and bonded, and then I'd get bored and stressed and frustrated, and the cycle would repeat.\n\nI started to feel constantly criticized and controlled by her - no amount of time spent with her seemed to be enough or her, and time spent with friends or family was taking away from time with her, and she would get jealous to the point that I felt guilty to out with friends and stopped calling my family. And I started to resent her for that and feel isolated, and she became the only person I spent time with outside of work. I also never had time to do things by myself, and began to desperately want to be alone.\n\nI confronted her about these things at various points and we tried to make different boundaries, but we'd just fall back into the same routine, but with growing guilt and frustration.\n\nIn general I have not been good about identifying my feelings or expressing them, and I tend to bottle things up until they reach critical, and then let out a whole slew of things that have been bothering me at once, taking things to the extreme where if I'd acknowledged them and brought them up with her sooner it might have been a smaller obstacle we could overcome.\n\nAs part of not identifying my feelings, I try to control them, and end up lying to myself about what I feel, need, and want. By extension I've then been lying to her, leading her to believe certain things to be true because I was so desperate to believe them myself.\n\nI didn't fully realise the extent to which I've been selfish and abusive in this relationship until today, on breaking up with her and her telling me all the shit I've done and why she thinks I've done it. For a while I even thought I was the victim, and that she was emotionally abusive, when in face she just genuinely loves me and I couldn't understand that because I don't know what it means to actually love someone and not just use them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am in therapy and I fully intend to remain single until I've sorted my shit out - I don't ever want to treat another person like this again.

I just want to know if this is normal, and if it isn't, where I go from here. Buckle up, kiddos, this could get long.\n\nAs long as I can remember, living with my dad was like walking on eggshells. He has two emotions: happy and angry. He is typically the most happy when he has alcohol and has been drinking all day. Strangely, he doesn't seem to get drunk, just friendlier. His alcoholism isn't debatable: he will drink half a beer and fill it up with water just so he can make it last longer.\n\nHe is aggressive and cruel in private. Once, when I was visiting with my two year old son, the family dog kept barking at him, and he grabbed a knife off the table and held it above his head, threatening to stab the dog to death. I immediately left with my son, and didn't speak to him until my grandma (his mom) called and begged me not to split up the family. This isn't an isolated incident. He threatens to beat any animal he finds annoying, which is typically a barking dog. He finds it funny to hold a dog down on its back and press on its throat. He doesn't do it often (generally when he's been drinking) but he'll hold down a dog and glare at it with this manic smile. I absolutely hate it.\n\nHe is degrading to everyone, especially my mom. He insults her constantly by calling her stupid, and screams at her when she doesn't hear him the first time he says something, and calls her deaf. He complains that she's slow, that she's lazy, whatever else he can think of. But then other times, he sexualizes her in front of me (whistling when she bends over, smacking her on the ass, etc.)\n\nMy brother and I grew up surrounded by his yelling, and cursing, and horrible comments. He would tell us we were disappointments if we did something he didn't like, and if we showed interest in something besides dad's personal interests, then dad wouldn't support them. For example, I have a wonderful singing voice and dreamed of being on Broadway. Dad told me that if I decided to pursue it, I would never be allowed to come back home. I was scared, and he convinced me to follow a \"safer\" option of being a teacher. Years later, Dad called and asked me to sing Amazing Grace over the phone for him and mom for their anniversary. I did, and he said, \"You really should have pursued that.\" I was devastated.\n\nIs my dad just an asshole? Or did he emotionally abuse my brother and I?

Right after we started dating, his best friend from childhood, who he was living with, got a girlfriend and stopped hanging around as much. The friend started being late on his rent payments. My nex got so mad at the friend for being late on rent and spending so much time with his girlfriend, that he decided to move out and stop talking to him - just cut him out of his life, no discussion, after they had been best friends for *decades*. The friend, who had idolized my ex before that girlfriend came around, probably didn't even know why this was happening. My ex's family just said that they thought it was a shame, but they didn't make an effort to fix anything or talk to him about it. Neither did I, as I assumed he'd cool down eventually. And in all honesty, I didn't particularly care for the friend, so in the back of my mind I was kind of thinking \"Good riddance!\" though now I feel horrible about it.\n\nI obviously became the supply after that. I'm assuming his new best friend is his new supply.

There is a tldr (similar to the title, which might be actually saying it all) on the bottom but if you have time and interest then I'd appreciate if you could read the whole thing.\n\nSo, I actually made a post about that in Idr which community (which was also my first post ever in Reddit, btw) and received mixed feedback so I deleted that and I'm coming back to talk about it more calmly now, without the hate I was speaking with about it last time.\n\nSo, I have a twin sister, and growing up, we spent a lot of time together, playing, talking and everything. Btw - My relationship with her fell apart on 4th grade, because I had a really bad behaviour, especially at school, due to the fact I had Asperger's, and this continued until I switched schools and started my SI diet. However, our relationship wasn't the same anymore. Her friends and teachers were asking her to \"pick up\" her brother, and she was holding me grudge. I know that was my fault, but me and sister relationship difficulties is another story. Thankfully our relationship has improved a lot since then.\n\nBut to get back to our point. 15 months after me and sis, my parents had another baby. My brother. \n\nThe earliest memories I have of him is probably him hitting me or sis.\n\nMy parents have admitted that, when he was born, my dad took me and sis to Crete, without mom nor him, and we stayed for 2 weeks instead of \"welcoming our newest family member\". My mom would take him down to Grandma's house to crawl, on fear we would hurt him, and once my dad was holding him and left him because we gave him dirty looks. \n\nSo my parents think they've contributed to that, but, me and sis spent more time together than we did with him. So when he started being aggressive towards us both, he got a free pass because \"he's angry\". It didn't matter what he did, nor why. He could pull sister's hair, hit me because I sat on his chair, try to drown us on a pool, and my parents never really did anything about it. \n\nAll they'd do was tell him \"Sweetheart, what you did was wrong, why did you do that?\" And then he'd be like \"Well not because he sat on my chair but because I remember when one year ago he disrespected me\", and then they'd come to me with \"He has anger because you and your sister had basically rejected him\".\n\nI've talked about it with my counselor, sister and parents, and a friend. That friend is by the way the only person I can really vent to about that topic saying whatever I want about my brother, because she also hates him.\n\nNow most people would say \"Why do you hang out with someone who hates your brother? You should stand up for him!\". Well, he's been calling her a whore for months, and is blaming her for ruining his best friend (him and her have been together for almost 14 months now). She was responsible for collecting the fees for a school trip, and he told her \"I don't give money to whores if they don't let me fuck them\". \n\nWhen nobody hears, I can say whatever I want to her about this topic, and she understands.\n\nThis is really getting me frustrated. It's not like anything new is happening. The flashbacks. The thoughts of these moments. I really get in a depressed state. I try to think less about that but I'm still sad and also get angry when I think about it. This is definitely not the only reason I'm a sad person but it's responsible for a lot more sadness and frustration.\n\nI also feel ashamed. Seriously. The story is just embarassing. It's not like I'm 10 years younger, he's a bodybuilder and 6 feet tall to represent a typical case people think of sometimes when they think about siblings hitting each other, I'm 15 months older, a bit taller, larger and far stronger than he is. Had I said the story without making it clear who's who, anyone would probably think I'm the one who was hitting the other. \n\nThat's not the case. All day long I think and get flashbacks of me accidentally throwing a snowball in his head during a snowfight, and then saying \"I'm sorry\" repeatedly so he doesn't hit me again for the same reason. I felt weak and I'm stronger than him, and it's embarassing af. He hit me and sis for that reason repeatedly that day, and... You can probably already guess the way mom handled it.\n\nHe's also done that when I sat on \"his\" chair on the table, opened my mouth to take a bite and \"didn't listen when he warned me not to eat with \"my mouth open\"\", flushed the toilet when he told me not to, when I looked and he told me not too, when I was just looking him trying to figure out what's wrong with the electricity (this time, in the balls), sometimes just randomly without nothing having happened before (like, once I thought he was playing irl WWE, on the era we played the videogame, and he actually was coming to blows with me and I didn't even know he was actually doing it seriously let alone why up to one particular point).\n\nNot even worth commenting what my mom did.\n\nI've said and though countless times the worst for him and how I wish he hadn't been born and all of this would be avoided with the use of 1 condom. This sounds terrible but it's true. And I didn't say it like \"oh once a year when I get really mad\", I feel like I meant it when I said it.\n\nOnce this happened, and only now thinking back about it do I realize how powerful yet true was what happened. So he was playing football and hit his head. My Grandma anxiously told my Dad not to let him sleep. I asked \"Why? Could he die?\". And the thing is I said it with a smile like I wanted it to happened. Cause I really did.\n\nI know all that sounds really powerful, mean and everything but this is just how much I've hated on him for what he had done. I knew how to write by 4 y.o. and I found notes I wrote at a really really young age, don't know when exactly but Ik it's been many years, of me writing about how much I hated him.\n\nLast time he did something like that was about 2 months ago, when I joined Reddit, and that's when all the flashbacks and embarrassment became a 24/7 thing. Because even though I almost always guarded him grudge, it usually didn't affect me on an everyday basis, just when something new happened and for a few days after that. I swore I'd react if he touched me again but I couldn't because he did it in a car. These feelings went away after a week or so, and they randomly returned on the last week of July. They haven't stopped ever since. I don't sleep well anymore, cause I just wake up sleepy but too sad to sleep again. I feel like my chest hurts, I have a burden on my head and a constant feeling of wanting to cry but I really rarely do, and I can't do it anyways (not like I'm keeping it in or smth). It sucks. It really does.\n\nI've blamed my parents, and I've talked about it with mom many teams. She says \"everyone makes mistakes, no parents gets born with a parenting degree\", \"it hurts me that you say these things about your brother\", \"it's just an obsession that will go away\" and \"that \"I'm sorry and getting hit\" incident wasn't fear but me saying I'm sorry I made a mistake and getting hit had nothing to do with that. At this point I don't care if she acknowledges her mistakes or not, and it's definitely not as she describes. She doesn't know, no matter how hard I try to explain. \n\nShe also keeps saying I'm really being unfair to him, bringing up examples like that he helped me on my SI diet in 4th grade.\n\nIk every parents wants their children having the best relationship possible. Well that shouldn't be the point. Your children have different personalities, interests, tastes and everything and as they can't get along with all 7.5+ billion humans, it's also a possibility they won't with their siblings. I want to have children one day, and even though of course I'd be happy to see my children having strong relationships, the point should really be eliminating sibling abuse (Idk if my case is classified as sibling abuse, but this part is also a general statement), and making your children not hate each other. Just respecting each other would be fine. \"All siblings fight\" is true, but... Sometimes it's not a typical case.\n\nUnfortunately, being made by semen and/or an ovum that were in a common person at once doesn't guarantee you'll have the best relationship. Parents just need to understand that.\n\n\"You choose friends, family is forever\". Exactly. At least if your friends don't respect you or something, you can just walk away and never talk to that person again. But for sharing a room with my brother all my life.. well almost all my life, if he was just a \"friend\", on the first time he hit me I'd walk away and I wouldn't have talked to him in at least 10 years now. I wouldn't care he even exists and I wouldn't care if you told me he'd died either. You choose which friends to keep. In the same way you don't choose who you biologically share DNA with but you should be able to choose whether to have typical or good relationships with them.\n\nI feel bad when I'm telling my parents I blame them about that, because I know they've done a lot for me, to have me complete my SI diet, to avoid having me sent to a school for special kids (they once took me there, to see where I was in danger of getting sent to, and there were also kids who were chased by the teachers to have saliva cleaned from their mouths).\n\nI've asked my sister and I still have no idea how she's so okay with everything when I'm ruining my health over it. \n\nAnd the last person I talked about it with is my counselor, whom I saw again recently after the summer break. She suggested it's the fact I feel weak and it's taken my brother's embodiment, and to feel better I should take up martial arts and tell my brother how I feel. None of these seem like helping me though. \n\nNow. By no means do I say this was happening all day long, every day. This was common when we were younger and it has been decreasing, it happens sporadically now, and my mom insists I stop blaming him. Yeah. We've had okay moments, we've watched matches together, he's helped me sometimes, and everything. Of course. That's why I'm not sure if that's sibling abuse. But weigh up the two - all the harm he's done me against the good. Why should I appreciate the good moments, when for every good moment followed many bad ones?\n\nCurrently he's disrespectful to everyone (also gets a free pass cos puberty, I'm also in puberty but I'm not like that). I passed French Language exams this summer and he managed to take all my happiness away within one minute. Wow.\n\nIf you've actually gone through all of this, and want to offer advice or support, then please do so and it means the world to me you took so much time reading about my fucked up self talking endlessly about why me, a stranger is not okay. I'd love to do the same thing with other Redditors but lately I feel so sad I can't read long texts anymore.\n\nI just want to know, how can I get over this, and live a happy life, or at least a life not depressing over this? Ik it may sound like my story is not the worst case ever - not even close, but I still feel depressed, down, sad and it's taking a toll on my mental health and affecting my everyday life. What can I do to just move on? It's not like this is a \"temporary thing\", it's been almost 1 \u00bd months and this hasn't stopped. Do you think it's deeper than that? Should I seek further help?\n\nThank you so much for bearing with me and for any advice!\n\nLet me just add that I wrote everything yesterday, and my Dad was worrying I wouldn't wake up in time for school cause it was too late. So I woke up at 6:30AM w/o any reason to do so because.. well.. I was sleepy but my sadness wouldn't let me sleep and now I'm waiting for my parents to go to work so I can drink a big amount of coffee to get through the day.\n\nTl;dr: I get flashbacks and think about all day long about times my brother hit me for stupid reasons and I feel frustrated, sad and it's affecting my mental health and everyday life. How do I get over this? It's not really temporary because it's not going away and it's already been almost 1 \u00bd months. Do you think it's deeper than that?

I met with a divorce lawyer in February of this year &amp; filed for the divorce in April. My final dissolution hearing is **next** week on the 19th (WooHoo!). I anticipate it to go very smoothly since my nex is in another state and has not responded to a single filing in the divorce case, he hasn't complied with parenting requirements for the divorce, nothing. He has ignored me and all communication that has to deal with the divorce, well, sans him trying to institute some ridiculous demand to have our kids (we share two young ones) at least 4-months out of the year BUT I am not to know where he lives (physical address) nor am I allowed to transport the kids to him and his girlfriend..instead he wants one of his family members to fly, pick up my kids and transport them back to him. UGH. The illogical chaos! \n\nAnyway...our daughter's second birthday is tomorrow! Yay! Friday the 13th :) But it has been hard for me on a lot of levels and I don't know why this emotional upheaval is happening right now. Now granted, I am financially struggling. I receive zero help from my nex-husband for our kids...I pay for daycare for both of them, food, diapers, all the necessities and more come from my paycheck. I literally live paycheck to paycheck. I make it to the next paycheck with maybe $10 to my name...it's been a real struggle for me as a single mom. I want to be great for them, not stress and feel like I'm gaining ground in making our lives better or more stable. Instead I end my night in tears, wondering how am I going to keep doing this for the next 18 years? Will my kids have issues because we don't have everything their friends/peers have? You know .. the typical downward spiral. *sigh*\n\nSo this week I have cried and cried and cried. Sat at my desk during lunch and cried. Drove home from work and cried. Just overwhelmed beyond words.\n\nMy daughter is going to have a nice family party (myself, her younger brother and my relatives), I bought her a few little gifts and I know she's only two so it isn't something momentous she'll remember and base her life on. But it saddens me her father can't even send a birthday card, let alone a gift or money for her. My ex-MIL kept lying to me, saying she had $100 for my daughter's birthday. Long story -- I ended up with $30 NOT the $100. Cool. Whatever. It's money we did not have and I'll use it towards the cake and party supplies. But it is the principle of ... I am TIRED of my ex and his family lying about even the smallest of things. I want to SO badly tell them to just leave me ALONE. They strung this lie along about gifts and $100 and ultimately turned into no gifts and $30 ... had they just not specified it would have been okay, but it's just another disappointment from his end that urks me on some base level.\n\nI'm sure subconsciously the final divorce hearing being next week is playing into my emotional well-being. Although I'm otherwise ambivalent about the whole thing since mentally I've been out of the marriage for a year now (having found out about his girlfriend, new life, etc.) I do know somewhere I'm just ...overwhelmed, sad and just in limbo about where do I go from here? Two young babies under two years old, an okay job that has me wanting to do more yet feeling like I'm stuck ... it is all just too much at times.\n\nI don't know. I'm trying to be strong but this week has been tough. I'm excited for my daughter's birthday &amp; to see her face when she sees all the Minnie Mouse decorations~!

Sure, be positive, be glad he's not disappointing her or mucking up her life at such a young age ... \n\nI guess I'm really stuck in this holding pattern and I'm losing sight of my potential future ... feeling like it won't get better when I know it has to! My life has gotten better just getting the narc out of my life so I imagine with time and healing, it'll keep progressing ... \n\nI just need so positive energy and words from this community.

We're all humans, some of us more flawed than others, but that's the nature of life, although when we become involved with a narcissist we're made to feel unworthy as if we're only meant to do as he/she expects in order to earn their acceptance. However, I do not believe despite our imperfections as humans that the majority of us deliberately set out to harm others by way of cruelty, selfishness, and complete disregard for another person by way of their thinking being different from ours. In this, possessing a desire to control another human being is totally unlike the narcissist who actually believes in their distorted reality that we should fall under their domain. All of our actions warrants their approval whereby we should move in a manner that pleases the narcissist, and with freewill being a foreign concept to the narcissist unless it revolves around their life and actions, those who fall on the spectrum of normal behavior will have continuous levels of conflict arising from relationships with a narcissist; especially those as it concerns intimate relationships. \n\nWhat I've notice is that when I dated a person whom I'd considered a n is their moods had a disruptive effect on mine.

I also felt confusion, depressed at not measuring up to their unreasonable demands, and this ended up being a never ending cycle of conflict/abuse because above all else, who would want to live in accordance to the views/demands of a narcissist? \n\nIn a nutshell, after being with this person my interpretation of contagious moods underwent greater clarity, and my understanding of unsettling behaviors as it relates to our own well-being deepened as well.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

It sounds like a classic sign of this stage is the narc pushing the relationship to move unusually fast and telling the victim they\u2019re their soul mate. My question is, did anyone else experience love bombing with a commitment-phone? Is this even a thing?\n\nHe was VERY aggressive with getting to know me when we first met (he even recorded me one time because he was conducting an \u201cinterview\u201d for fun). He would want to spend hours with me almost everyday after classes where he\u2019d ask me countless questions from my favorite food to what I look for in a boyfriend. He\u2019d come over and spend the night multiple times per week. Had me meet his friends and roommates pretty early on and they always mentioned all the wonderful things they heard about me.\n\nAnyways, throughout all of that, he kept telling me he wasn\u2019t looking for a serious relationship because he doesn\u2019t want to get hurt and he doesn\u2019t think he believes in monogamy. But he acted like I was his girlfriend as he always wanted to be around me and would get insanely jealous if I even spoke to another guy. And while he never called me his soulmate, he would do things like ask to stare into my eyes and listen to my heart beat. \n\nBasically, I was the only one who ever moved the relationship forward (e.g exclusivity happened because I told him I was moving on as I was looking for a relationship). Which seems unusual with narcs or at least I haven\u2019t heard many people share a similar experience (yet)\n\nDid anyone else have a similar experience? If so, what was yours like?

Seeing people who are struggling and moving in to alleviate their suffering. But with narcissists, this is the exact thing you should never try to do. \n\nI always thought that love could fix anything, and ultimately I believe it can, but narcissists are NOT open to love and do NOT operate out of love. So, that means that any love you try to pour into them will only get lost in the black hole that is their being. The energy that you give, along with YOU yourself, will just get wasted and consumed in the process.\n\nThen, what happens over time is, you take on their energy and you deteriorate as a person, or disappear altogether. You won\u2019t know who you are anymore. You won\u2019t remember how you used to feel, how you used to \u201cdo life\u201d. You\u2019ll be gone. And all because you exposed yourself to the toxic radiation that is a narcissist. \n\nSo, don\u2019t try to fix them. Don\u2019t try to make things better for them.

Then I feel drained when I recognize the common tactics all over again - the devaluation, the intentional crossing of boundaries, the way they have to draw everything back to themselves, that same odd distanced feeling and look.  Just can't help think narcs in the population may be much more than the official stats show today, especially the covert ones, at least in the country I live in.

I'm just going to cancel and tell everyone I don't feel good to save your ego since you're being a little bitch about everything\" I know how exaggerated that sounds...but it was always so extreme like that.

{"post_id": "d3aog7", "created_utc": 1568306860, "title": "Time to jump ship", "author": "LittleMissMoxie19", "self_text": "My partner and I have been together for a year and a half, and the entire thing has been the wildest ride.\n\nLet's just say that I met him, at one of the worst times in my life, and one of the best points of vulnerability for him to sneak through.\n\nHe was such a nice guy when I met him, but at the same time had a way of pushing my boundaries. The first real sign is when I told him I never had sex without condoms, which of course became his first goal. He managed to make me feel like that wasn't reasonable, and that I shouldn't hold him to that standard. Yup. Red flag #1.\n\nWe knew each other for 6 months before dating. Our relationship started as we were definitely going to date, until he realized he wasn't at a point in his life for that. He told me he just needed a friend, and that I was one of the coolest people he had met. \"Cool. Fine. We can be friends, but can I hear the reason why you won't date me, when two hours ago you were asking me to move to you?\"(I lived 3.5 hrs away and was driving to see him every weekend). \"I dont have to answer that question and if you respected me you wouldn't ask\". Okay.... I felt like I was clearly coming off as needy, so I attempted to back off. \n\nBut he still constantly talked to me. He would call at 3 in the morning, talking about how rough his life was and that he just wanted someone that cared. He wanted me to come see him every weekend, (which meant 7 hrs total drive for me, around $100 in gas, and another $100 in food for both of us the weekend, because he didnt have a job, since he was just trying to get through his last year of school). He got extremely jealous if I said I was even talking to another guy. He kept acting like he wanted all the benefits if a relationship, without the title. But when I would just casually ask why the dynamic was that way, I was pushing him, I wasnt respecting him, I was being needy and crazy. Red flag #2.\n\nSo, after being \"best friends\" on and off for 6 months, he finally came around to the idea of dating. Coincidentally, it was at the same time that I was juggling around the idea of dating a guy that happened to be an ER doctor. I had only casually mentioned it and mostly kept the idea hidden, because even though we were \"best friends\" I was already tired of the jealousy from someone who didnt want to date me. He noticed a lack of attention on his end and when it finally came out I was talking to someone, he was ready to date me within a few weeks. Red flag #3. I might have found someone \"better\" or \"more accomplished\" than him.\n\nSo, here we are dating, and it got to the point that I wasnt able to set any boundaries in the relationship. I have two kids from a previous relationship, but me saying it wasn't his place to punish them was out of bounds. Of course, now that is such an obvious \"get the hell out\" moment. But, at the time he made me feel so unreasonable for saying it wasn't his place. He would tell me that all of his friends and his dad thought he should have that right. He would tell me I was crazy and selfish for not letting him. That I would never find anyone that would date me with two kids, especially if I wasn't going to let them set some rules for MY kids. Red flag #4. \n\nWe have been dating for 2 months, and he wants the kids and I to move in. Okay. Even though he could be really cruel and vicious sometimes, he could also be really nice. He'd had a hard life. He was adopted as a baby, his adoptive parents were neglectful, his adopted mom died when he was 18, one ex gf used to punch him, the last gf left after a fight and not only never talked to him again, but got a restraining order. He told me he had done some things wrong in those relationships, but ultimately they were the crazy ones and all they had ever contributed to the relationship was pain, while all he ever did was go out of his way for him. They were using him. No matter what the situation, he was always being mistreated and was clearly the victim. Red flag #5.\n\nSo, now we live together. And, now he wants to get married. Dating for 2 months, known each other for 8 months. He kept pushing the idea of marriage, and I kept saying I wasnt at that place in my life. I was divorced, with two kids, and definitely wanted to get to know my partner before making that commitment again. Suddenly, I was crazy and taking advantage of him. Didnt I know how lucky I was to find someone willing to do as much as he did, when I came with so much baggage? I would never find someone as smart, caring, and motivated as him, and I should consider myself lucky that he wanted to marry me. Amazingly, all of that drama, and he had never once actually proposed. Never once actually asked if I wanted to marry him. He just thought that we should and if I didn't agree, I must be using him. MAJOR red flag #6.\n\nAfter a couple month of us constantly fighting about marriage, he finally gave up. I wasnt going to budge, and \"if I was going to take advantage, he was just going to let me\".\n \nBut now I'm pregnant. \n\nHe's so happy. He's always wanted his own kids, he has always wanted a family, everything is going to be so great. And it was, for like 3 weeks before morning sickness set in.\nSuddenly, I dont want to continue our routine of twice daily sex. I'm nauseous and tired, and I might even want to take a day off. But, how dare I? Don't I know that sex is the most important thing to him a relationship? Don't I know how lucky I am to have him? He could be off sleeping with a different college freshman every night, but instead he's there with me. I should get an abortion. Sex is the only thing that matters. \n\nWe would stay up fighting until early morning almost every night. I had to be up at 530 to get my daughter ready for school. I run my own online business and take care of my pre-k son everyday.l, and I was averaging about 15 hrs of sleep every week, while being in early pregnancy, because he wanted to fight about SOMETHING almost every night. I'm so tired. I have terrible morning sickness. And, he keeps going back and forth between how much he is going to love being a dad and how I should get an abortion, because he can't be in a sexless relationship (while we are still having sex at least 4-5 times a week). MAJOR red flag #7.\n\nSo, for the next couple of months, we cycle. I try and do everything I can to make him happy, regardless of what I need or even want, and he still finds ways to be super pissed at me. \n\nThen, we get to my birthday. We have a pretty good day. We got out for dinner. We go to Wal-Mart to get me the first birthday cake I had in years. He seems like he cares so much and just wants to make ONE DAY special for me. Until, we are leaving walmart and he asks if \"we are going to fuck\" that night. \"What? I don't know? Maybe? Can we see how I feel????\". Suddenly, he is miserable. Don't I know how much he is giving up for me? Don't I know how close he is to killing himself? Why dont I care? \n\nAt that point, I was done. Despite how often we were fighting, I am almost never confrontational. I hate arguing. I hate starting fights. I hate making people mad. But I was at the point that I was DONE. We fought all night, with me just trying to leave. I wasnt allowed to leave. He would block the door. He would grab me. He just wanted to know why I didn't see how lucky I was to have him. Finally, I gave up and decided on a better plan. I made him think he was right. That I was completely unreasonable for not feeling like having sex. My bad. I have morning sickness. I'm soooo sorry.\n\nI woke up early the next morning, with3 hrs sleep and started packing the kids and I up. He wasn't going to let me leave, so I was going to do it without him knowing. Until he woke up. He realized immediately what was going on (remember his ex girlfriend ghosted him) and tried to convince me to stay. I wasnt going to. So, he has me talk to a mutual friend (who he on/off HATES), so that she can try to convince me to stay. At first, she tried, and then even she gave up because she knew what he was like and was also tired of the narcissism he brought to their friendship. \n\nSo, I left. I got about 45 mins away, and suddenly convinced myself that I was in the wrong. Wasnt he always saying how dramatic I was? How immature I was? This did seem dramatic and not at all how a mature adult would end a relationship. I already was convinced that I was all of the hurtful things he constantly accused me of being. I went back. Big mistake.\n\nI get to his house and he goes on and on about how sorry he is. He finally sees how wrong he was. He will do better, if I will just stay. I became hopeful. I wanted to believe him. He was so right, and I was the crazy one. I'm so sorry I walked out. That must have been so hard after the last girl did the same thing.\n\n6 days later was Christmas. We went back to stay with parents in my hometown, on Christmas eve. We had a good car ride there, that night we were sweet to each other. Everything seemed great. Until We were about to go to bed. As I'm falling asleep, he wants to know If I think we are going to turn out like my parents. They seem to tolerate each other but he's not sure they actually love each other. I dont want to answer. This seems like an argument in the making. I just want to sleep. Can we discuss it later, it's Christmas? \n\nSuddenly, I'm the crazy one again. I'm taking advantage of him. I'm stonewalling him. Who cares if everyone else in the house is asleep and he's waking them up with his anger. Who cares if they dont have a good Christmas? We spent all night fighting and into the next day. I kept insisting we discuss it later, and he keeps demanding we fix it now. My kids are opening Christmas presents, and he demands I go outside so we can talk. My family wants to sit down to Christmas lunch that my mom spent all morning making, and he just wants to talk. He doesn't realize how insane he is making both of us look. If he would just calm down for a few hours, we can discuss it later. But he doesn't. He is just SO angry. \n He even manages to make my mom and stepdad think I am the one doing it. They have met him 3 times, known me my entire life, but he manages to make them think I am the bad guy. I am mistreating him. Don't they know how lucky I am to have him? The same tactics he used on me, he used against me, and they fell for it.\nI was hurt and quite angry that he was doing this. I told him that after all of that, we were actually done. It had been 6 days since I last tried to leave. I was 10 weeks pregnant and just wanted my kids to have a nice Christmas.\n\nSo, he agrees we are done walks outside. I figured maybe he would actually go cool down, think it over, and realize all the drama he was creating because I didnt want to answer the question of if we would \"turn out like my parents\". \n\nNope. He goes outside and texts my ex husband to let him know I was pregnant. Something I had been putting off, because we were still trying to work out coparenting properly, and I didn't want to cause drama between us.\n\nThat was it. I went from being hurt and angry, to actually being livid. It wasn't enough to ruin Christmas for my family, but he just went and pissed off my ex, who was supposed to get the kids in a few hours and spend the rest of Christmas with them. He ruined christmas for my kids TWICE. I was past done. My parents are pissed at me. He's telling me how crazy I am. My poor grandmother is just sitting in the corner super confused. And I just stopped. I faked apologizing to him. Told him he was right. Told my parents I was so sorry. Loaded my kids in the car to go to their dads, and we left. \n\nWe were supppsed to drive the 3.5 hours home, after dropping off kids, but there was no way that was going to be possible. He's still going on and on about how abusive I am when I shut down and stone wall him. He could have picked anyone and he picked me, only for me to abuse him. He could have fucked so many college freshman in the tome we have been dating. He lowered his standards for me. He was taking care of MY kids. I decided that if he was so convinced I was mistreating him, that he was on his own. I dropped him off at a bus station, and bought him a ticket home.\n\nThis is something I would never usually do. I have never been that angry in my life. Dropping someone off at a bus station on Christmas is just heartless. But, I was out of options. I should have left a few days before, but I had been hopeful that I was the one that was always wrong, and if I just did better we would be better. \n\nI went and called the same friend that he had hoped would convince me to stay and she told me she was proud of what I had done, that he totally deserved it, and to come on over and stay a few days with her.\n\nHe starts texting me and her immediately. She lets him know that my plan is to stay with her, and that she is just going to be neutral until things calm down. He then starts demanding that she make sure I get an abortion, while also blowing up my phone demanding I get an abortion. He wants nothing to do with me and if I decide to keep the kid, he wants nothing to do with it. He's going to stay with family a couple of days, and all my stuff needs to be gone from his life by the time he gets back. The friend says I can stay with her until I get back on my feet. \n\nSo, we go a few days with him constantly messaging me to tell me how sorry he is, while also telling me how ungrateful I am, and that I should still get an abortion. We leave out after 2 days to go pack up all my stuff, while he isn't there. \n\nNow is also the time where I mention that on my birthday, I had gone to the doctor for an ultrasound and a blood test to determine the gender of the baby. We were told they would call the day or two after christmas and that we would definitely know before new years.\n\nSo I'm driving the 5 hrs with my friend, to go and pack up all of my stuff, when I get the call about the baby's gender. What should have been a happy moment, was completely shadowed by everything else going on. I was having a boy, and I had just a few weeks to figure out if I wanted to keep him or have an abortion. Me, the person who is pro-choice but never saw myself getting an abortion, having to decide if it was actually the best choice. \n\nI went numb. I didnt know what the best choice was. Even though my friend kept telling me I had done nothing wrong and that there was nothing wrong with me, I still questioned. He had convinced my parents I was crazy. They've known me my whole life. I must actually be crazy. He was right. It was all my fault. Why hadn't I just told him that we would never turn out like my parents, kissed him, and gone to bed??\n\nI started talking to him again. He was so sorry. He was going to work on it, please just come home. So, I told him that he had some things he needed to work on, but I would also work on some things. He told me he was convinced he had borderline personality disorder and that he was going to get counseling. He would work super hard and everything would be great.\n\nSo, I went back. He starts counseling and they diagnosis him with BPD and OCD. He goes on medication, he goes to therapy twice a week. Things are really good. We dont fight. We rarely disagree. Everything seems quite normal. \n\nUntil a few weeks before the baby is born.  Suddenly, I'm back to not being super sexual (only 4-5 times a week, instead of 7) and he needs an outlet. If he could just sleep with other people, he would be super happy. Sex is one of the most important parts of his life, and I misrepresented myself when we first met by saying that I could have sex 5-6 nights a week. I'm back to being crazy and not caring about what he needs. I'm 37 weeks pregnant, but his main concern is sleeping with a college freshman. \n\nSo I tell him, fine. If thats what you need. Do it. I dont want to fight about sex. Things had been really good, but if that's what you need, take it. I just want this to work.\n\nHe didn't though, and I was so glad. He kept talking about him, I kept saying I was cool with it if it would make everything else okay. I didn't want my son to grow up without his dad, just because I could have sex regularly. But, I was so happy he didn't act on it and thought maybe just thinking he had the option was enough.\n\nUntil the baby is born and is now a week old. He can't go any longer without sex and we are supposed to wait another 5 weeks. He wants to meet up with an old \"fuck buddy\" and just get a release. He doesn't know if he will actually be able to go through with it, but he wants to try. \"Fine. I will stay at home with a week old baby, and you go have fun\". So he goes.\n\nHe comes back and claims nothing happened, even though he was gone for 4 hrs. They just talked, they attempted sex, but he couldn't go through with it. I didn't want to know details, so I just left it at what he said. \n\nBut, he is now on Tinder, trying to find other hookups. He says he doesn't know if it was just the girl he was with and that maybe he could go through with it with someone else. He just needs a release. \n\nHe talks to girls, constantly talks with me about sleeping with them possibly, but he never actually does anything. He's still not going to counseling, we are back to fighting, but not as bad because I constantly give in to whatever he wants to make it stop.\n\nI have a month old baby, I'm working 50 hrs a week and have been since he was 3 days old, still have two other kids. I'm just drained.\n\nThen, we moved to a new house. On top of everything else going on, we moved. So now, I'm dealing with baby, still working, kids, trying to organize and unpack, and all he wants to talk about is the girls on Tinder. We've been moved in 2 weeks, and he finds one he thinks I could be friends with. He wants her to come over and hangout. He's not going to sleep with her (more than likely), but he really wants her to come over.\n\nSo she does. I tell him that I am not at all cool with him sleeping with her if she does, but if you are so convinced I would want to be friends with her, she can come. So she has a friend drop her off. She's nice, we talk, we all hang out, but then the baby gets hungry. I leave to go nurse him in our bedroom, and within a few minutes my partner comes in to let me know he wants to try to sleep with her. In his office. While the kids and I are in the house. Are you kidding me? Hadent I made my boundaries known before she came over???\n\nBut saying no to him is never an option. And I dont have the energy to fight. \"Sure. Go for it. Have fun\". He does. He claims it only lasted about 30 seconds before he felt bad. But, it still happened. And now I can't bear to go in his office. Plus, I had to take the girl home.\n\nNow, I'm back to being done. I can't live like this. I've just been diagnosed with postpartum depression, and I feel like my life is falling apart. I ask him to stop. I tell him it hurts and that I hate feeling this way. He says he understands and will uninstall tinder.\n\nA week later he is back at it. \"It's okay though, right?\". He just needs sex and since I'm still recovering, he should be able to get it elsewhere. Except, we were having sex. Had been since the baby was 2 weeks old. 4 weeks before I was medically supppsed to. I'm at risk for infection because of it. Who cares? He needs sex and I dont care about him if I dont let him get it from somewhere.\n\nI just want this to work. I have now built my whole life around him. I'm still possibly the crazy one and just don't know how hard life is for him. He was abused as a kid. He has all these past issues and sex helps him to feel better. I just wajt him to feel better so we can be happy.\n\nBut I'm not happy. All he talks about is girls on Tinder or how I feel about him sleeping around. We dont talk about life. We dont talk about the baby. We dont talk about me or the fact that I am dealing with a month old newborn, breastfeeding, raising two other kids, and working 50 hrs a week.\n\nWe do this for several more weeks, until 3 weeks ago I told him I can't. He tried to bring up tinder again, after I told him 2 days before that I didnt want him to do it anymore, and he got super mad. He starts telling me he doesn't think the baby is his, that it must be a guys a dated when I was 15-19 and hadn't talked to in years, because the guy randomly messaged me on FB a few weeks before. He started berating and belittling me, grabbing me and manuevering me like I was a ragdoll, while Im holding the baby. And it got so bad that his dad, who also lives with us, called the cops on him.  \n\nTHEY show up and he is still livid. They can't calm him down. They let him know if he doesn't they will take him in for disturbing the peace, they let me know that I have every right to take the baby and leave. He eventually tells them he will just leave for the night and they say good enough and leave.\n\nBut as soon as they are gone, he is back. He just needs to grab some stuff, but he wants me to know that he never cared about me and that I need to get out, along with his dad. He calls the landlord at 3am, thinking she will back him up, but she doesnt care. He and his dad are on the lease, and she's not taking his dad off.\n\nWe try telling him how unreasonable he is, and after about an hour he stops suddenly and claims that something is wrong. He has to have a brain tumor and he needs to go to the ER. At 4 in the morning. His dad and I are just stunned. He walks himself to the hospital, and messages me for the entire time he's there. He claims the nurses and doctors also believe that he has a brain tumor and that he should have had an MRI months ago. But, they dont have any dye on hand for an MRI, so they send him home and tell him to see his doctor. 3 weeks later and I still haven't even seen an ER bill, so I'm pretty sure it's all BS.\n\nWe talk a few days later and I make it known that I dont want him sleeping around. Again. He says cool and he won't bring it up.\n\nLast week, he brought it up. I immediately tried to shoot it down and let him know the he needed to focus on our relationship. He says he gets it, But 5 days later he has already completely forgotten and starts talking about how he needs to find a new playmate.\n\nIt took 5 days for it to completely leave his mind and bring it back up. 5 whole days. I'm pissed. I'm done. I can't anymore. I want to go home. I can focus on my kids and work, but I can't focus on him anymore. \nMy life is falling apart and he hasn't truly asked how I'm doing in weeks. \n\nHe says he will actually stop, but he just needs one more fling first. He needs to sleep with someone in the next 2 weeks, and then we can focus on us. I let him know that he has no idea how bad it is. That I'm ready to leave ASAP, because I can't do this anymore. But he's adamant. He wants us to get better but he needs this and I dont care about him if I can't see that.\n\nFine. Have your fling. You didnt even touch your son yesterday. You changed a diaper the day before and then left him to me. You don't care that all I want to do is talk to you about OUR life. \n\nI still haven't figured out how, but I am leaving. It sucks, but I have to be sneaky about it. Today is my mom's 60th birthday and if it weren't for that, I would be gone today. But he has me convinced that all I do is start drama, and I cant start drama on her birthday. Next week, Maybe? While he is at work? Just pack up as much as I can and go??  He will find a replacement for me, after all he has been telling me I'm replaceable from the day he met me. He can finally focus on just sex again, and I will worry about my kids and my job.\n\nThere is so much I left out of this story. So many other bad memories. Things I dont want to think about, things I dont want to discuss. If it seems like I beared it all, I didnt. I was so stupid for not seeing clearly before. I dont know how I missed all of this and thought I was the issue. But yes. Now I fully know why his ex girlfriend walked out the door one day, got a restraining order, and never looked back.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Once again, even though I am generally a strong willed person, I felt guilty and wanted to appease him.\n\nSomewhere inside of me I knew this relationship was wrong, it wasn't what I thought it was going to be. He was drunk most of the time I was around him, often times I sat through sex waiting for it to be over. I had friends of mine and friends of his who told us there was nothing wrong with the age gap in our relationship as long as we loved eachother. Maybe at one point I was infatuated with him, but after a few months I knew I needed out.\n\nI gave my two weeks notice at work, and when my time was up, a week before I started my grade 12 year I told him our relationship was illegal and so I needed to break up with him. He told me he was going to throw out all my things (I was at his apartment a lot) and that if I went to the police he would tell them I forced myself on to him when he was drunk. (I have messages to prove this). He told me that I was just like the rest of the girls he had dated and that I was the one to blame for the downfall of our relationship.\n\nI told him that I would not go to the police and I was doing it to save his ass, and since then I have stayed quiet for a year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts about this relationship have effected me for the past year, I had a hard time dating afterwards, I felt fucked up and like no one was ever going to love me. I felt disgusting, like all I was ever going to be to people was a sex object. I have intrusive thoughts about the situation sometimes and it makes me physically sick, it feels like I can't crawl out of my skin and it makes me never want to have sex again.\n\nI told my therapist about the entire situation yesterday and she agrees that this was sexual abuse, because of my age and also some of the things that happened. To others, they don't see the age difference as a problem and tell me that I am overreacting. The way I see it, even being just a year older than I was, was that at 16 years old I was a child. I feel like with his life experience he was able to coerce me into being with him.\n\nI have told my mother about this and I have messages to prove some of my claims about him threatening to lie about me to the police and him admitting that he knew being in a relationship with me at 16 was wrong. I am going to a family friend in the force for advice on what I can do, but I haven't made any decisions yet. \n\nSome of other people's views about the relationship have veered me off of filing a report, because I am scared I will have my sexual history and personal information dug into. I am scared to get up on the stand and feel dehumanized.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny input is appreciated, \n\n\\- Lots of love &lt;3", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

My Nex has a current supply/gf, they have been together for 1.5 yrs now. \n\n- Nex is a CN (covert narc), it was an LDR relationship, and it took me 3 years to get out of the verbal abuse, manipulation and blackmail. And more verbal abuse online after the break up.\n\n- Current supply, is also in an LDR, as she is from the same country as me. She was a rebound, they are engaged now. Dont know her personally, but she posts a lot of hate social media posts towards me. (and badmouths a whole lot of other people too)\n\nAfter No Contact, I received a lot of hate and spam messages, that i completely ignored. I thought everything was okay, until 2 months ago, I learned I have a 'spy' in my personal IG account. Turns out it was them or her. This fake account has been faithfully viewing my stories and was following all my close friends and relatives for the past year. I have asked all my friends to block the account. That fake account was deleted so I'm sure Nex and supply know they had been found out. I have blocked them everywhere possible. \n\nWhat compicates this, is that the new supply and me are in the same online business. And she has been again, targetting me and my business relentlessly. Business is public account and she had been copying my every marketing move.  And she also posts personal attacks to me in her business page. \n\nQuestions:\n\n1. What could be the thought behind this? I know I have been bad mouthed and looks as the evil person but I feel the new supply/gf is more aggressive than my Nex. I have a good feeling that she is a Narcissist too. But im not sure if they are both teaming up on me or its only her, the supply who seems obsessed. \n\n2. Is it possible that they have a 'good' relationship that will lead to marriage? My Nex attitude was he never had interest for marriage and family. Or is this a scheme to make me jealous cause I posted a picture before with a guy?\n\n3. If they are engaged, why are they not in peace?\n\n4. If I see the Nex and new supply personally, what should I do? It looks like she will be attending the same business events as I do. \n\nThank you everyone, please share your stories or advice as I really want to avoid any drama in this.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He also had a tendency to be paranoiac over many things, and every few months his paranoia would change over to something else. I am wondering if perhaps paranoia or irrational fears is something that others have dealt with when it comes to their NEXs?\n\n\nA rundown of the (long and abbreviated) list of traits/events that make me think he is a narcissist:\n\n- thinks of himself highly, above authority, usually all talk and no action about it (eg. belittles teachers in private about reasonable demands such as handing in assignments on time, belittles policemen, politicians, rules)\n\n* extremely rude/hurtful to his mother, treats her like a servant (eg. phone calls where she calls to ask him what he wants for dinner, he answers rudely and hangs in her face, literally never heard him address his mother kindly)\n\n* hid relationship from most people, no PDA whatsoever\n\n* hid me from his parents saying that they wouldn't like me and that they are \"strange people\", going as far as sneaking me inside the house overnight and making me wait until the \"all clear\" for me to leave - he is a 25 yo man)\n\n* belittles my friends and family - my friends are \"stupid little kids\" and my family apparently \"hates him\", even though he has never interacted with them more than saying hello. He was so convincing I ended up believing it and accusing my own mother of giving him \"the evil eyes\" and judging him.\n\n* no empathy whatsoever on my feelings of neglect regarding sex -- we'd have no sex for months at a time (3 to 6 months) and upon trying to discuss things through with him where one night I broke down sobbing he said I should just \"look for someone else to fulfil those needs\"\n\n* never wrong about anything, others just misunderstand him/are too stupid to understand\n\n* monopolises conversations in groups, loves to be the centre of the attention\n\n* embellishes stories or straight up makes them up, highly defensive when questioned\n\n* controlling behaviour regarding his paranoia, see list below\n\nOn to the paranoia. I call it paranoia because I am not sure what else I could refer to those traits. It seemed to border on OCD behaviour almost, I do not know. Maybe I am completely misinterpreting it all but it felt so controlling and like I could not escape these behaviours.\n\n* An all-encompassing paranoia that seemed consistent was his fear of me getting pregnant. Made me take the morning after-pill after having sex for the first time with a condom. After I got on the pill, we would have sex with condoms and he would make me go into the bathroom and watch him fill the condom with water after we were done. He would hold it up to me face and squeeze it, repeating multiple times \"see? there is no hole, right? there is no hole? it's not torn? there is no hole?\". He had a sob story about how an ex pretending to be pregnant so he would stay with her.\n\n* He had a thing for bottles near electrical outlets. At first, when we were at his house and getting ready to leave, he would make a round of the house (3 stories) checking that there were no water bottles near every single electrical outlet. Then, he made me do it *with* him, and then *for* him. Later on, it came to unplugging every extension cables and outlets (lamps, consoles, microwave). He would make me do multiple rounds around the house, looking under the beds, behind couches, etc. I'd do it because I didn't want to be late to events as he'd refuse to leave otherwise, and I didn't want to fight/had pity for what I thought was OCD.\n\n* He also had a thing for the stove being turned off. There were 6 buttons and he would check they were all on 0 before leaving. He would point at the buttons saying \"zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero\". Over and over for 5 minutes straight. He'd get pissed off if I wasn't looking with him. If I looked elsewhere he'd say I am distracted and he would start over. I once suggested to him he should just take a picture of the buttons and get it over with. So he did take multiple pictures. And then filming. And then I had to film him.\n\n* He then developed a sudden fear of driving, even though he had no problem driving us around at the beginning of the relationship. Suddenly, people were apparently jumping into the street in front of his car all of the time, so he was too scared to drive. If he was driving, any time he'd reverse out of a parking spot he'd make me get out of the car and check thee surrounding area to make sure he didn't hit anyone. I had to explain over and over again that if we had hit anyone, we'd know and hear it. If I was driving, he'd make me return to certain spots that he deemed \"dangerous\" and were I could have \"likely\" hit someone.\n\n* Once said that there was a police control at the entrance of my village (even though there has never been any in the history of me living there for 20 years as these are farm lands) and therefore he could never ever come pick me up again.\n\n* Then, he would have a thing for seats. Everywhere we went where we'd sit (restaurant, bus, train, plane, bench) he'd pat the seat a few times to make sure they were safe, or not wet, or there were no sharp objects embedded in the fabric (???). Then he would ask me to do it for him. I did it for a while until I said that he should do it himself, and he was extremely upset over it.\n\n* Most alarming one is when he once commented that the whole \"metoo\" movement was fucked up and that he was scared of \"getting metoo'd\". Went on about a girl that he once hugged by the waist and said what if she metoo'd him over that, and that he wasn't safe because of it.\n\n* He is very white and very middle class. He had a long, thick beard. He would go on about how police officers looked at him weirdly and threateningly, \"probably because they think he's a terrorist\". When I told him that was ridiculous, and would make up scenarios where he was apparently questioned by officers on the train, in the street, wherever.\n\nHonestly the list goes on and on and on. It wasn't until I moved for my studies and got to distance myself that I realised how controlling and unnecessary all of this was.

I ended an unhappy relationship and he was married, but had filed for divorce from his \"unstable, alcoholic\" wife (this was not a cheating situation on my part. Later came to realize it WAS on his). He reflected back at me every single quality I felt I wanted in the perfect partner; responsible, strong, confident, good work ethic, strong morals, intelligent, loving parent, and with a childhood/teen history that was eerily similar to my own, commonalies and shared interests out the wazoo. Everything I said that had been missing in the relationship I was ending. \n\nAfter knowing him for a few short months he told me he loved me, that we were soul mates, the whole 9 yards and I somehow believed that and found myself feeling the same. He asked me if he could stay with me if things got ugly with his wife and because I loved him I agreed, despite the fact my ex had yet to find his own living arrangements. I was going to try and fast track that to accommodate him. Fast forward a month and a half later and he never showed up to a planned night together followed by radio silence for a week that ultimately ended in a discard.\n\nI was devastated and learned he had decided to give his wife the opportunity to \"fix\" everything that was wrong with HER. Thereafter I unknowingly became his backup supply. Over the next 3 years I got my life in order, got fit, mentally healthy, successful in my job, taking care of my kids, successfully co-parenting with my ex, and was overall very well adjusted but remained single because I kept measuring everyone I met to the impossible standard he had set. During that time he would message out of nowhere with extremely contrived messages to evoke the biggest emotional response he could get. I fell for it each and every time. Sometimes it was just texts, other times we would meet up and talk, once he even came and stayed with me for 3 days. Each time ended in an abrupt discard that left me reeling emotionally. I would pick up the pieces and carry on as best I could. \n\nThe final reach out by him came 1.5 yrs after the last and he was no longer with his wife, but was a shell of a man, so broken my heart ached for him. He even contemplated suicide and almost went through with it (so he says). He told me she had been drugging him, was a raving alcoholic that made them lose everything, including his career (he worked double duty as a cop and a manager for a security company) and had she had turned both of them into addicts to prescription pain meds. He claimed he didn't know what she had done (she managing his meds during a period of mental heath issues and an injury) until it was too late. He was now broken down to living in his mother's basement, no job, and the sole provider to his youngest child. \n\nI never knew that there were people who could fabricate and lie to this level, with full support of the fabrication by their own mother (I think she believes it too). I'm a fixer and have damages of my own, fear of abandonment, and insecurities that made me need to be wanted by him after so many discards.\n\nWe began dating and I was hell bent on being the most supportive, non-judgemental, and accepting partner I could be. I was going to heal him with love, I was going to make him whole again, and I was going to have a chance to be with my \"soulmate\". And it started to work. He slowly started to come out of his depression, became healthier both physically and mentally, and began living. I thought we were going to get married one day and grow old together.\n\nHis mother sold her house out of necessity 1.5 yrs later and he moved in with me. I became the sole provider for our 3 youngest children (my 2, his 1). In the beginning I was amazing, I was on a pedastle, I was perfect and too good for him. He was wonderful to me, treated me with love, care and respect. \n\nHe told me how when we reconnected he had been laying in bed months before alone and bed ridden, fantasizing about what our relationship could have been, how he knew he had created an unrealistic version of me in his head. He told me about how his psyche had broken. All his walls and masks had crumbled. That he had no empathy in the past and he was being flooded with emotions he had no name for now. That he was just fucked up and afraid he would hurt me. I wanted to be his saviour and I didn't understand what he was telling me. He was telling me he was a narc and I didn't even know it. He and I both had abusive childhoods and I believed that he was ready to start healing and we would do it together.\n\nHe moved in and the devaluing began. There were fights that made no sense, an arrest for a road rage related incident and another incident  just a month ago where he assaulted someone but didn't get caught, never ever ever being wrong and twisting things to always be my fault, unprevoked rage, name calling, gas lighting, silent treatment, ignoring messages, never a resolution to any disagreement, irrational word salad arguments, pointing out any flaw in me he could imagine, and on it goes. Yet he had plans to propose to me on my birthday just a few days ago.\n\nI finally googled what was happening and came to the realization that he was a narc about 2 months ago. I mourned our relationship and all the dreams I had and then went straight into denial. Maybe because he seemed to know about his masks and his lack of empathy he could get better. Then a week before my birthday he exploded at me in rage after I suggested he was upset at me via text and when he was making no sense I stopped responding. Something snapped in me that night and I realized I can't do this anymore.\n\nHe has been at his mother's with his child for the last week and a half. I have told him I can't be in a relationship with someone like this and that his \"healing\" will ultimately destroy me. I have stopped communicating with him since saying this (2 days ago) and have changed the locks and kept family close so I don't get sucked back in. I'm struggling immensely with the guilt of leaving him homeless, his child being uprooted, and with his pleading for forgiveness. That I'm not giving him an opportunity to correct what he's done, to go to a shrink and counselling. He didn't know things were so bad etc etc. He wants to love only me and if he fucks up again he will leave of his own volition. I just can't believe him, but I feel like a horrible human being. How can I stick to my gut feelings and follow through on this break without also feeling like the scum of the earth? I am terrified of conflict and figuring out how to have him remove belongings. I'm terrified of what he will say or do once he learns I changed the locks (I've never felt like I had to do that in my life before). I'm just a ball of anxiety and sadness and guilt.

I wanted to share some of my experience as an individual who is post recovery. (I am using all they/them pronouns for the sake of some anonymity)\n\nI wanted to post because we don't often get a lot of post recovery submissions (which is perfectly fine) so I wanted to post about an experience I have every 6-8 months and give some encouragement to those who are still recovering from the abusive relationship(s). \n\nWhen I left my abuser, I got myself a new apartment and didn't look back for almost 5 months, and then when I posted on FB about seeking out a sitter for my cat (a cat I got in the breakup, win!) they reached out wanting me to honor the passive agreement I made about letting them sit when I'm out of town.  I wasn't sure, I consulted a friend, and they told me -\n\n&gt;\"Know that you would be allowing them back into your sphere of influence, *even if you think you are ready,* just remember that\". \n\nAnd I thought I was, I was in the forgiveness phase of my recovery, and amongst other reasons, I responded.  This resulted in about 5-6 months of minimal contact with my abuser that mainly revolved around cat-sitting, and then one night, I was feeling at something of a low and for some odd reason my ex needed to drop off something and I allowed them to come by.  **That was the night I realized my abuser never really changed, just changed tactics.** Longer story short - I ghosted them after that. \n\nAt this point, I hadn't sought out therapy, but within 3 months of going full no-contact I was in extensive therapy for depression and as a victim of abuse. So now cut to ~2.5 years later; I am very mentally healthy and doing great, I no longer feel like I am in 'recovery' persay, but I continue to talk to my therapist and take medication for my depression. But there is something that keeps happening that as time goes by I feel differently about each time it occurs.\n\nAs you might be able to guess - it's that my abuser contacts me, so far via text message.  The first few times after I broke contact and I didn't respond he'd leave me alone, but every 6-8 months it would come out of nowhere (paraphrased): \n\n&gt;Hey, just wanted to let you know that the emailing list you told me about for cheap flights was super helpful and I got a great deal on a trip.  Thanks!!\n\nI'd ignore it, delete it, I had their number but only to know it was them, maybe because I was paranoid, I can't tell you, it was irrational.  I'd be angry because I thought I made it clear by not responding; doesn't that mean \"not interested, leave me alone, I don't need or want you around, so go away\". I'd talk to my therapist about it and what my friend said about my abuser being in my sphere of influence would come back,  the more I healed from what happened the more I saw it as that pathetic and feeble attempt to reel me back in, to talk to me, so I would assure them that *they changed*. \n\nAnother half a year would go by and the message would come back. I don't even remember what they would say, but it'd be much of the same.  That same attempt at the tug of rope, but they can't see that I'm not even playing, I'm not holding on to the other side, but I just want to see if they are trying to pull.  \n\nAt a certain point I made the decision to move, and part of the reason was that the apartment I lived in was what I felt like was my \"recovery\" apartment.  It was the sanctuary that I cultivated to heal and grow from the relationship.  A part of me felt like it was time to move on from that moment in my life, and I didn't want the spatial reminder of it anymore, I felt whole again, and I wanted to feel like my home reflected that. When I spoke to my therapist about it she suggested that when I did move, that I block my abusers number, the irrational reasons as to why I kept it were just that, irrational. If I was healed, I didn't need to know they were trying to reach me, it was a stressor I didn't need. So I did it, I blocked the number and that it was a chapter of my life that closed. \n\nAnd then last week, a message came in from FB messenger (paraphrased): \n\n&gt;Hey, thought I'd reach out as I have a box of your stuff from when you left.  Sorry our relationship went so downhill especially because of me *haha*. Well anyways, you're the best!\n\nFeel free to be angry along with me, because you know what I wish I could say to that jerk, \"Screw you, it was clear that you chose another method of getting in contact with me when clearly I had no interest in letting you pull me back in. And why on earth do you have a box of my things, you know all the stuff I had of you, I threw it in the trash, and if I found another thing, I threw that in the trash.  When I moved I got rid of the furniture you let me keep, and the cleaned you out of my life like I cleaned out my old apartment. This tug of war game you keep trying to play with me, well I stopped watching to see if you would even pick up the rope, so fuck off.\" \n\nI know it's not healthy to, so I don't repond again, I wish I could in the healed state that I am be able to dash their attempts of ever reaching out again.  Maybe I could reply simply \"just burn it, I don't care\". But I recognize the growth I have made since I left 3 years ago, and the growth they haven't. These feeble messages are just that, a clear disrespect to the fact that I have established I do not want to talk to them. Like I said **My abuser never really changed, they just changed tactics.**\n\nEven though it angers me, that's all it does, it does not set me back, it does not give me PTSD, I do not dwell or sulk, I see my abuser for what they *still* are. This is what *my* recovery looks like after 3 years,  and today I will finish posting this and go about my lovely day, I will continue to enjoy my life, because my abuse is no longer a shadow that looms over me and changes the shade of my reality, but sits annoyingly in the corner, a small dot in the backgroud of my life. It took time though for that overwhelming and monstrous shadow to grow smaller and smaller until I no longer notice it. \n\nWhether you are still in recovery, trying to leave, or just figuring out you are in an abusive relationship, **be kind to yourself**. You deserve to be treated with respect, love, and kindness, and the best person to start doing that is you.  \n\nWishing you all the best \n-ff22", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I'm never the one with him, instead it's always him with someone else while I'm watching (not necessarily that I'm there in person watching or anything. But just seeing what's occurring like an invisible being). The only thing that I came across that explains this is a cuckquean fetish, but the thing is, it's only in regards to him. The only time I had some type of fantasy about someone else other than him, the idea of that person with someone else was a complete turn off. I couldn't even imagine it. So I know that this fetish isn't something that I truly want, but yet it comes up during my fantasies with my nex. \n\nThe first time these thoughts came up was when I was still with my ex and I found out he cheated on me the first time. Immediately, it was like my mind latched onto these thoughts. I don't know what it is about them that causes me to get turned on, but I really hate it. It's painful and hurtful thinking about his cheating, triangulation, and him leaving me for others, yet it's what I think about when I masturbate. Hell, because of his cheating, he gave me an std. He put my health at risk so many times. I just don't understand why I can only think about these terrible fantasies. \n\nI've tried to come to an understanding with it, but I really can't come up with a reasoning why. I just know that his cheating is what triggered this whole thing. I think that maybe the idea of him with others is like a weird explanation in my own mind for justifying my irrational insecurities?

Since pre-k i remember very vividly all of the beatings i received from my Vietnamese mother. She grew up in war torn Vietnam with no parents. So she lived a very tough early life. My dad on the other hand is a doctor and grew up in a wealthy family with a good childhood. I do know that they care for me at least so i think, they cook meals for me, take me to school, fight for my classes, drive me hours to a soccer game etc... It was only til today i questioned if it was normal for this to happen... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEver since a little kid, I remember my beatings very vividly, and (sadly) i remember more than any other memories as a little elementary school student. Sometimes my mom beat me with, metal and plastic bats, metal poles, spaghetti spoons, you name it. I realize that I always did something stupid to deserve it, but it was nothing ever egregious. I was a well behaved kid, i always made all A's, did my schoolwork, tried my hardest. But one beating in 1st grade will forever follow me around, my mother had beaten me til my nose bled and my legs became numb. With the last of my strength i ran away from her and locked myself in my room as she called the police. My dad showed up from a night shift and immediately backed up my mom as the police questioned me about my misbehavior. At the time i accepted it, i just felt awful about it that i ran away from her, and with the police and my dad against me, i just accepted it. I also remember a beating in 3rd grade, I remember talking back to her that evening, and as she was going to get her metal pole, i ran in my room and locked myself. She eventually started knocking my door down. The door was starting to crack open (like the seen from the shining, but without the ax, just a pole) so i just started to barricade the door with my skinny 3rd grade self. She gave up and once again... called the police. I felt instant regret and I just accepted it as the many other beatings. Beatings like these have continued even up to this exact day. Often times i would run away, pack a backpack in go live in the woods for a day, and even a shelter once in 7th grade. My mom never seems happy, constantly mad, yelling at me. you name it. Yet i still have respect for her, except until today, i feel as if im loosing that respect for her. Because today was particularly awful.\n\nToday, My dad was trying to get me into a prestigious private school. My mom stormed in as we were doing the application process and told my dad that because of my behavior the past few days he shouldn't let me go. the problem is with that, is that most of the time, my parents never tell me what i did wrong. So i never knew that my mom was upset with me for the past few days. I tried to recall things I have done, and couldn't come up with anything. When i asked what i did, she stuttered and couldn't come up with anything and just said, \"See you never learn!\". While i do admit i shouldn't have said this in the moment i said, \"well if you feel you don't want me to go here, then don't send me.\" to which she turned around punched me and sent me to my room. Up there (due to my knee injury) i lost balance and tripped over something on my dirty teenage room. I fell and it made a very loud bang. She came up moments (my door was locked) and started banging on it. I didn't answer because i knew i was about to be beat. She started a countdown to which i ignored. Then after she threatened to call the police. So with that, I opened the door and there she was, with a metal pole. She yelled at me for 10 minutes while flogging at me. Then my dad gave me a lecture on why im such a \"bad boy.\" and used my mom;s past as an excuse for flogging me. My mom then made me pack up my clothes and made my dad drop me off at a police station.

I could tell my dad pitied me, and i saw tears coming down his check as i said i hated myself and proceeded to throw my head against the window. Only because i was confused, lost, hurt, and at the time i really hated who i was. They always make me feel bad for things, even for being smart or athletic, and because of that, i sometimes wish i wasn't me. They say that someone else could be so fortunate to be smart and that I;m lucky and dont appreciate it. I believe they're wrong, I've always worked super hard in school, never below a 94. yet its still my fault that im smart.

She was heading in the direction of a bar she used to drag me to all of the time.\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe it. I thought she lived far enough away that she wouldn\u2019t dare go there. Right down the road from me. With all of the people who live in my area, how do I keep running into her?\n\nI\u2019m once again feeling terrified to go anywhere for fear that she\u2019ll be there.\n\nThis woman hurt me so terribly, it was the greatest pain I\u2019ve ever endured when she cheated on me and discarded me. I\u2019m terrified of her. I don\u2019t ever want to see her, and I don\u2019t know what she would do if she saw me.\n\nI\u2019m still so completely screwed up because of this person. How do I live in an area where she\u2019s frigging everywhere and I can\u2019t hide from her? And all the while she\u2019s building her reputation, and gaining followers, and building talents, attributes and new artistic endeavors to broaden her reach? My career job is here, and I can\u2019t move right now because it\u2019s not the right time.\n\nWhat do I do?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Sometimes i still wonder if i did suffer from narrastic abuse. \n\nWhen i first met my ex we hit it off it was magical. He made me feel like i was the the luckiest women on this planet. We spoke about the future alot marrying each other. The sex was crazy. I felt like true love making  we were so deep emotionally and spiritually i really thought he was the one iv been looking for my entire life. \n\nThen things started changing. He stopped doing the small things like suprising me. Stopped calling me often.  He said he didnt ' need love or affection' he started going out till the early morning without telling me. Calling me clingy, crazy, telling me i should see someone and seek therapy. He would become involved with a crowd that would do drugs consistently. He would start lavashing on himself buying himself luxary items. Not even considering planning and saving for the future \n\nThen i broke it off and he walked away like it was nothing to him. \nThen a few weeks later he began to contact me and started crying and crying saying that he loved me. Then he started to say things like \n\" didnt you see the signs that i wasnt stable ?\" \n\" didnt you see the signs i was selfish ?\"", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Though I think I have to. I was in an emotionally abusive relationship with what I think was a narcissistic sociopath about 3 1/2 years ago. Recovering from it took a lot, and in this time, I did speak briefly about what happened to friends and family, but not really in depth.\n\nThere were several reasons why I didn't go into too much detail about it. First of all, I was still in the aftermath of the manipulation, feeling like taking about it is wrong and it wasn't my place to do so, and if I would, it would be dangerous. Secondly, we had a lot of mutual friends and I did not want to be the one that talks bad about the other person, also being new to the situation and trying to figure out what I could say and what not. And lastly, it was of course super embarrassing to talk about it because I felt degraded and stupid, and like it was just beyond anyone to understand how you could let all of this happen to you.\n\nBy now, I am in a happy relationship for 2 1/2 years, but I still feel that I am not free of what happened to me, that it is sleeping inside me and comes out now and then to shake me up. I talked to my partner about the general outline of what happened but I don't want to spam him with this shit of my last relationship. He knows enough to understand why certain things freak me out of course.\nI have been to two therapists since, they have worked great for me in terms of the present, but I never really got to talk about the past, and it would feel weird to ask them to talk about it.\n\nI wish I could just leave it all behind me, but for some reason I still think of it a lot. My heart starts to race when I am in situations with people connected to my ex or talk about related topics. I sometimes still have nightmares about it. I feel like something is unresolved and I really don't know how to fix it.\n\nSo I thought I would write here to maybe get some advice or hear about your experience. Did you talk about it in detail, and if yes, how long after it happened and whom did you talk to? And did it help you?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I had finally been able to put the pieces together, realized I\u2019ve been in an abusive relationship, and have only now began to try and heal. Unfortunately I live in her house, and she been my best friend/person I fell in love with for seven years and she knows it so keeps me on her hook and as friends even though from any angle you look at it we have been in a relationship minus the sex. \n\nShe has constantly belittled me, hangs past mistakes and insecurities over my head, over criticized every move I do, disregarded my feelings and views, text book what everyone says a narc does. The only reason I\u2019ve had trouble accepting it is because she opens up, makes me laugh and smile, speaks so rationally and can be so loving and kind and vulnerable and just great to be with at times. \n\nWhich breaks my heart because I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s real, a manipulation tactic, or what I feel at times is the wounded child feeling comfortable enough to show herself (I know she had a strict childhood and I sometimes get hints of trauma that she\u2019s in denial of, she has said that her family is not very supportive and she has a very time strict lifestyle balancing work and school, so few real friends and I think her nature is the cause, she pushes People who love her away) And that makes leaving so damn difficult because even though my brain says run my heart says no you can help be there for her because who else is there? \n\nBut today after a switch from nice to over critical Silent treatment/belittle/make me jealous dinner. It ended with her saying that she\u2019s had enough, that the friendship isn\u2019t serving her anymore that we\u2019re done, that we can\u2019t even have a fun dinner together because I can\u2019t hear her (even though she picked the restaurant which was loud and I voiced my reluctance about). Unfortunately I pushed her the wrong way, by not reacting, to calmly trying to figure out what she meant. Suddenly her tactic of make me sad or freak out, turned into anger because I suggested that maybe I move out and I suddenly showed her emotion and a break in the chain by bringing up that her three month notice to move out was excessive. She then found her in and like a lawyer cut down my arguments, made me nervous slip up. She said that real life doesn\u2019t work that way, that apartments don\u2019t let you get away with that, that I don\u2019t get how the real world works that I\u2019m lucky that she was generous enough not to charge me a down payment and more. To which I said, that this is different you\u2019re my friend and paying you the money and utilities we agreed upon but there\u2019s no lease. \n\nAnd the scariest response came from her, she said if I wanted to play that game, you can move out tonight but oh wait hold on all your stuff is in my house and all I need is the cops called. And she had the angriest satisfied smile on her face. A face that said I won, your move. To which I receded, and eventually I agreed to her three months and told her that I reacted emotionally, that I\u2019m sorry, and that I was coming from a place of suggesting a solution because our friendship sounded over. We shook on it. So in three months I\u2019m out, maybe. \n\nRight after, after some more talking. We had a heartfelt talk, and she was happy and fun and talked about herself. And I smiled like a dummy, part of me wondering what was real, hoping she\u2019d cuddle with me, and the other part wanting out or wishing it was different.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I'm (M) terrified that my mental health issues brought on by my emotionally abusive ex (F) will stick with me forever.", "author": "TownesVan", "self_text": "I'm exhausted from how awful I feel about myself all of the time. I was pretty confident, and outgoing when we first met and started dating, but after a year of lies, manipulation, cheating and being run-down virtually every day... I feel like I've completely lost myself.\n\nI haven't gone out in months, I hate looking at myself in the mirror - I feel a mix of so many things (stupid, pathetic, embarrassed, dumb, untalented, worthless) I was made to feel all of these things by her. All of the time. I felt trapped, and our relationship was always held over my head in such a way like:\n\n\"Accept this, and we'll stay together. I love you so much, you're my person - I see a future with us, but if you can't accept this then your not letting us have that future that I want.\"\n\nThis would kill me inside. Things didn't start like this until two months in, and I had very quickly fallen completely - Being told, after being run down that the future with the person I'm deeply in love with would be ruined by me was something that destroyed me. I was given so many ultimatums throughout the course of our relationship, threatened so many times that if I couldn't give her this, or that it wouldn't be her breaking up with me, but me breaking up with her and that I'd be breaking her heart - This broke my heart, and I didn't understand - Told her I would never break her heart, but her response was always \"if you don't agree with this then you are, and you are dumping me. You're doing this, not me.\" and this was in regards to things like wanting to have sex with other men for money, and so many other things that tortured me and made me feel like there was nothing about me that was worth sticking around for. It was a year, like I said, almost every day. I paid her rent twice, because she couldn't afford to. And I did so with a smile, and I never held it against her. But when I was going through money problems I went to her for nothing more than comfort. I brought it up hoping she'd make me feel like it was going to be okay, it wasn't THAT bad, but I get anxious so sometimes I need to talk it through. Well, she immediately started tearing into me, and telling me how dumb I am and how scary it is to her that I don't have my shit completely together - That her last boyfriend was like that, and that I must be just like him. This wouldn't end until I apologized over and over because I have money issues. Typing this is so hard, just imagining her reading this - I am absolutely terrified of her, as pathetic as that might sound. She's just torn me down to the point of anxiety attacks so many times over things, a lot of the times, I couldn't understand what I had done, but was made to feel like I was terrible. I worry every day she'll pop up out of nowhere and run me down again. I know that's strange, and probably hard to comprehend - I know it doesn't make sense, I can identify with that but I'm still so scared of it happening, cause I don't think I can take another ounce of feeling even worse about myself.\n\nShe's very respected in this town, she's a voice for the LGBTQ, and speaks out about how women are too often over-sexualized, that love is love - Something I agree with, with all of my heart. When she first told me about how often she speaks up about these things, and how many people she's touched and helped who have struggled with acceptance, and like I said, being over-sexualized I remember just feeling like I was sitting across from the kindest, most level-headed, strongest person I've ever met.\n\nShe also is an advocate for mental health, and always encourages and inspires those suffering with anxiety and depression and whatever else -\n\nLater in our relationship, she ultimatum forced our relationship to be open when it comes to women- If I didn't accept that, then I didn't love her and that I was leaving her - the pattern, as always. She'd always tell me it's not an ultimatum, because it would be me who's leaving - Even though it wouldn't.\n\nall I asked, in regards to it, was that communication be present about this, she wouldn't get mad when I had questions - Not intrusive ones, but questions pertaining to better understanding poly, because it was an entirely new world for me, and I not only wanted to better understand it all, but I felt like by asking questions and listening to the answers I'd in one way be showing her that I am on board, and she had nothing to feel bad about. My last request was, while I wanted communication in regards to her plans I would not want to know the intimate details that occur. It would hurt too much.\n\nI was told that I cannot ask questions, because it's annoying, and will lead to her having to give me reassurance or comfort about the whole thing. I was also told that she was going to tell me every detail of her hook-ups with girls. She, seemingly offended, told me that I should want her to tell me every detail. That two girls having sex is hot, and that I should be turned on by it. When I explained that I didn't look at it like that. That I looked at it like two human beings connecting and sharing in a moment - a moment that I as her partner, who had no clue this would be sprung on out of nowhere, would feel very anxious about that. It wasn't okay, or acceptable, so she got her way.\n\nAnd when I didn't want her to escort, or get a sugar daddy, she told me that I treat women like objects, that I think she's trash, and a whore - I'd get emotional about it, a lot, and beg the point that isn't the case. I'd never think that. I hate that i seem that way by being uncomfortable by the thought. \"Something's wrong with you, something's wrong with you, how can you not see what a selfish asshole your'e being.\" I don't have anything but respect for whoever does those things, because this world is a struggle and I am no one to question what someone else can justify what they find right for themselves, but these things would come out of nowhere, and every time I'd ask any questions I'd get yelled at.\n\nI one time was yelled at for over an hour straight, because she wanted to answer yes to a Craig's List Ad posted wanting a woman who would be down to at any time provide him whatever sexual relief he wanted, and in return he'd give her a thousand dollars a week. I told her very calmly that it would hurt me a lot if she did that. That my anxiety would be really awful about it, I'd just be very sad.\n\nFor an hour I was told how selfish I was, how I didn't love her, or care about her, that I only cared about owning her - that I see her as my object. I finally, felt like I was on the verge of a complete anxiety attack and I gave in and told her it was okay, that she could do it because I could not take being yelled at and told negative things about myself any longer, it was too overwhelming. She told me that wasn't good enough, and that I would have to now tell her all of the pros/benefits to her accepting this Ad. I was speechless, emotionally so nervous and gutted.\n\nThese are just small examples of what it was like. I know it's my fault for staying, and pathetic and weak of me for not being able to walk away - I can say that in the moment I was truly manipulated and convinced that if the relationship ended, not only would it be my fault but that I'd be losing the one. The good moments in between all of these bad moments I was presented with this clear picture of a life spent together as partners, something no one else would get - that I was her heart. I'm not trying to make excuses, sorry I'm just a mess about it and I don't know.\n\nMy anxiety was made all the worst because, while in public she'd speak up for those struggling with anxiety she'd tell me one on one that my anxiety was a burden on her, and that she resented it when I'd come to her when I'm anxious, or talk to her about my social anxiety, to never do it again. So I didn't. I just kept it in as best as I could, and when I'd have a bad day where I was dealing with it she'd have nothing to do with me.\n\nWe finally ended things after a situation that completely shattered me. I won't go into it, but it was... just, definitely by far the worst thing she or anyone has ever done to me in my life. And her only concern was me speaking out about our relationship, what she had done to me. I had no intention of doing that, I just wanted to move on and try to get past this.\n\nFor weeks she'd tell me she still loved me, that she hoped once she wasn't so busy and focused that we could do it again, right - I now know this was her trying to keep my hopes up that we had a future enough to not ruin that future by speaking up about everything. I guess she got tired of doing that, because we made plans to go out, and get drinks- I ended up getting really drunk, but not blackout drunk because I remember everything - we were having a nice conversation, when all of a sudden she freaked out. Confused, I asked what was wrong and she explained to me, I'm assuming because she thought I was blackout, that I attempted to grope her twice. I was pale white horrified by this, and shaken up, and not able to comprehend what she was saying, why she was saying it so angrily because it didn't happen. She demanded to take me home then and there, and when arriving home, she told me to get the fuck out of her car and she sped off.\n\nI felt lower than I'd ever felt in my entire life. I laid in bed crying, broken apart by why she'd say/do that to me and I first called my roommate, and told him I hated everything and that I was stupid, and worthless and then apologized for calling while he was out. I then called my parents and told them I loved them, and how sorry I was that at almost thirty I haven't accomplished anything worthwhile. Scared for my safety, my roommate called the cops and I was baker acted.\n\nIt was the longest 48 hours of my life. I couldn't do anything but lay in the room I was given and think. When I got out I got home and hugged my roommate, told him I wasn't mad at him, just incase he thought I might be. Told him how hard it was, and that I'd prefer it if he didn't tell anyone I was baker acted, cause I felt it was an incredibly low point for me.\n\nThat night, I got a facebook message from someone my ex used to work with. He said he needed to talk to me, and told me to never talk to my ex again- that she was toxic, and was going to be the end of me. He said that she visited their work randomly the previous night and told everybody she could that 1. I got baker acted. 2. That I tried to grope her twice. He said, she was describing it in a way that made me look crazy, and her a hero who got out of a situation that was out of hand. I was once again speechless, and couldn't tell you which upset me more, the fact that she was saying what she was, or that she was telling everyone she could I was baker acted. I was terrified of her before this, but now even more so- I had a conversation with my roommate, about how that night was almost a blessing in disguise for me, because after that experience, out of fear, I never wanted to see her again.\n\nShe texted me a little later, telling me how bothered she was by what I had done. I was hit with immediate crushing anxiety. And I was way too scared to defend myself, because in the year we dated every single time I defended myself, I'd be yelled at and made to feel like a worthless human being. I couldn't imagine being made to feel that even more so, so without even considering anything else I apologized to her, and made up an excuse - that the doctor told me I blacked out, because of mixing my medication with alcohol. At first I was relieved, because by not defending myself and apologizing the conversation was over, and I wouldn't/didn't receive another text. It wasn't until a few days had passed that I realized the only reason she texted me that, was hoping to get me to say something she could screenshot. I know she knew I knew, and she now felt safe that I'd never speak up about her because if I did, she had that to falsely put on me.\n\nThe only way I know how to describe it is, realizing that your abuser won.\n\nA lot of people she has abused in the past have reached out to me, wanted to talk to me, share conversations with me about experiences. They were all so similar it's scary. And she's made up things about a lot of men, and women she's had problems with - sexual abuse related, to place her as a victim and them a horrible person.\n\nShe told me and everybody who'd listen that one person in particular we knew raped women - He'd get them drunk to the point where they couldn't consent to anything, and then he'd take advantage.\n\nWell, she messaged me a while ago, singing my praises, and letting me know how talented I am- because she wanted the rights to a story (I'm a writer) which I came up with. No part of me wanted to give her the rights to anything of mine, but she tried to make small talk, and told me very casually that she no longer isn't friends with that guy, that he's a great dude and they're even best friends now. And that she got him a job where she works. I don't care who you are, you don't accuse somebody of what she accused him of unless you're sure, but more importantly than that - You don't make up with that person, and be their friend - or at the very least, get them a job where you work.\n\nIt was as if she had never said that about him, and after that like dominos people's stories fell into me, all similar, people she'd say did things that made her out to be the protagonist and them the bad person.\n\nThere are so many things that plague my head - All of the negativity I have regarding myself, and the fact that so many - so many people who only know her for what she talks about and fights for respect her with every fiber they have, and it's all lies - every bit of it. And none of them will ever know the things she's done and the affect she's had on the people she has hurt.\n\nHer life is going amazingly, while I sink lower every day.\n\nAnd it hurts.\n\nI'm sorry this is so long, but I'm trying to find a therapist right now, looking very hard, but I just - some nights you get so anxious, you need to not just keep it in your head, and I didn't know where else to put these feelings.\n\nI'm sorry if this post looks and seems like a book, or is annoying, or out of line - It's not my intention. I just really wanna get better. I really wanna feel okay again. And I'm really, really going through a hard time right now. I'm just so tired, and beat up.\n\nwhile I wouldn't wish this on anybody, I'd really like to know if others have been where I'm at, if they've been able to overcome it and if it's at all understandable that I wasn't able to leave.\n\nI think sharing my experience with others, and relating with people is one of many steps I need right now in feeling less negative about myself, and my decisions, repercussions and stuff. Much love reddit.\n\nTL;DR Emotionally abusive ex, who has mislead so many people regarding who she truly is has affected my mental health in a way I'm terrified I'll never be able to fully recover from. Just wondering who can relate if anyone - I feel pathetic and stupid I wasn't able to leave. It's because I couldn't leave that this happened to me, thus it truly is my fault.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

So, unfortunately I come from an extremely abusive home situation. I just recently graduated college and decided that I could not return home for my own mental health. My boyfriend (dating for 2 years, same college), had his parents offer to have me stay with them while we both were looking for jobs. They were also going to help my get my drivers license. I use to be really close to both of his parents. His mom is much better than his father, but his father has been an absolute monster.\n\nFirst off, I feel really uncomfortable living here. My boyfriend got a job so we'll be relocating in less than two weeks. We just need to stick it out until then. The entirety of my boyfriend searching for a job was super stressful. He did so many interviews, but only received denials. I was there to comfort him the entire time. I told him it would come, and just to be patient. Well, his asshole father on the other hand, was the exact opposite. He kept telling him that both of us were going to live in a trailer park with a broken down car. Mind you that both of us have our college degrees. He repeatedly alluded that my BF was not going to get a job and was going to be a loser.\n\nEvery time my BF would have a really big interview, the day before his father would be a total asshole and treat him and I like shit, making my BF extremely upset before his interview. Every time he would get an interview, his father would be extremely standoffish and not supportive. Most of the time he would say, \"I don't see you in this type of job\". To.Every.single.job. It was ridiculous. Now that he does have a job, he has repeatedly told him that this job is a mistake for him blah, blah, blah. It's a management trainee program with an international business. He'll be making 50k a year.\n\nWell, he's also been treating me like shit too. He tells my boyfriend that I am lazy, not going anywhere with my life, etc. He has repeatedly threatened to kick me out on numerous occasions. And at the worst times too. He'll tell my BF to tell me that we are all having a serious \"talk\". He did it when I was at work, literally making me have a panic attack. To the point where I had to leave work. Later, he told my BF that if \"I didn't shape up, I was getting sent back home\". Mind you, I've done nothing wrong. I stay in my room almost all day to avoid him. Recently, my BF and I went up to the city where his job is, because he had an interview. I went with him so we could explore the area and look for apartments. \n\nLegitimately, the first night we were there we get a long email from his mother that his father made her send, stating that I was not to come back and that my BF was to drive me home. My BF talked him out of it, and I returned (Because I only have 2 weeks left to stick it out). The entire time we've been back, he's been in a terrible asshole-ish mood. This morning he woke up early (my bf works early in the morning) to tell him that it's not a good idea for him to live with me, because \"I won't be contributing to paying for anything.\" It's utter bullshit. I don't make as much as my BF does, but I help as much as I can. I was the one to do all of the apartment searching, applications, etc. I paid for our deposit check to be overnighted to the complex. That alone cost me $82. I buy all of my own food because his parents just up and stopped buying food for the house. There are days where I go hungry because I can't get to the store for food. His mom and his dad will go out to dinner all the time, but not tell us so we just go hungry.\n\nThe question is, where do I go from here?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

A good paying job, graduated from a top college, and he was eager to settle down with the right person. I thought he be \"the one\", but then things began to take a turn. \n\nI met his family after a few dates. His mother was a psycho, clearly narcissistic because she felt entitled to everything, always blamed others for her problems, and always wanted the last word. Her husband seemed to be crushed beneath her and her daughter was acting like her. My boyfriend said he always wanted to leave home because of the constant fighting in the house. Not a healthy environment I'll say because I grew up with a close knit family and this was a shocker for me. \n\nIt wasn't until he started acting like his mom. He didn't want to do things I wanted to do, so whenever I suggested some things, he would overact and complain that we didn't get to do the things he wanted to do. When he got a new job, he complained about the \"dumb\" people at work and that he was the smartest one there. When he wanted to have sex or do sexting, I wanted him to back off on the subject just a little, but he was demanding. \n\nI should've left him earlier because whenever we talked, he would want to pick a fight, but would blame me for starting it. There were a couple of things he blamed me for, even thought it was his fault. I think the \"final\" straw was when he demanded he and I move into an apartment in a very expensive area. I was still in college and struggling to find work. After I graduated, he would yell at me to find a good paying job. \n\nIt wasn't until after my sister's wedding that he came over to see me and said he wanted a break. I thought so too because I needed to clear my head about him. Then both my best friend and my sister called to say they wanted me to break up with him. He told both of them about how \"ungrateful\" I was about him and that he called me these names. Both my friend and my sister told him to stay away from me and that he was nothing but a stupid, ungrateful a\\*\\*hole who picked on a poor woman who was willing to give everything up for him. It was then I decided to break off all communication with him and that he was forbidden to come near me and my family. I didn't bother to wish him luck in his future because he didn't deserve it. No one should be with this guy. He was nothing, but a narcissistic loser who will not find peace until he got whatever he wanted. \n\nFor over two years, I am happily single, still looking for a partner, but I am happy without having to concentrate on a partner.

Without music I get overwhelmed and I break down.\n\nall the teachers I had let me use my phone just for music, and would students would question it they would say thats how he copes and leave him alone.\n\nnow while in here class if you had your phone out she would take it away in an instant, and threaten to keep til the end of the week, which I have no clue if that is even true.\n\nnow there were times I couldnt even function in her class because geometry is something no matter how hard I try I cant understand it. I was able to get through that hell of a class because of my accommodations.\n\nnow there were somethings she did I am not happy all about and still trying to get over.\n\nShe would always tell me, that the work I did wasnt good enough and I put no effort into my work, and why I never study at home, the reason I never studied in her class was #1 she didnt even deserve my effort even though I tried my best, #2 the moment I walked in the door of my home after school I would go on my PC put on my headphones turn on my music and game or video edit, all I did at home was cope because how toxic my home was. #3 how can you study something if you cant understand it, I look in the book and all I see is gibberish.\n\nWhile I was in highschool another accommodation I had was I was allowed at my request to go to the sensory room and calm down and be in there as long as I need or just be in the special ED room to calm down and get myself together. my teacher would always shame me for wanting to go and cope.\n\nThe person I could always go to in highschool about my abusive teacher was my case manager, she understood and I could tell she loved me and she wanted to see me succeed and without her I never would have survived.\n\nThere was one time my abusive teacher got fed up with me and she sat down in front of me at the table I was at and said \"look you have 2 options here, #1 you can be high functioning student and be in my class, or #2 you can be a LOW functioning student and be in the special ED room. After class I was told someone I trusted about what happened and they said thats discrimination, so I went and reported it. then later my abusive teacher confronted me in lunch room as I was moving between classes and she pulled me aside and yelled in my face why I reported her to her higher ups.\n\nI was in the cafeteria which meant, loud and very simulating, not to mention she was yelling at me not just because of how loud the cafeteria was but because she was pissed. after her rant I ran to the gym where my case manager was with the special ED kids, sadly I couldnt find her but someone else in her class I trusted saw me cry and sob terrified out of my mind and I told her everything. she told me it was going to be okay and her and my case manager would take care of it.\n\nshe was reported but nothing came out of it. and to this day she is still teaching there. I wasnt her only victim. Many kids of report her for her BS but nothing ever changes.\n\nI had enough during my second semester with her , so I asked a friend of mine to draw me some vent art about her. and it had two part I only showed her the top, because the bottom was my fursona attacking her shadowing telling her and I quote \"Don't cry like a bitch when you feel the pain\"\n\nBut I printed out the first part which was this\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2jsj06i5dmm31.png?width=1022&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1a3fd7ef4b7ca341f89475de0cc1a2c70f658c5\n\nThe wolf is a depiction of me, and she knew that fully.\n\nwith the help of my case manager I wrote a note asking her to stop what she was doing. I gave it to her, and a the next week after class we discussed it. And she basic told me \"I'm not going to change and suck it up\"\n\nI would fantasize about ripping out her throat and walking her bleed out. I hated her. (my inner wolf showing XD)\n\nyou are probably wondering, why didnt you tell your parents and get help from them? as I said above I lived in an toxic and abusive home, so I couldnt get help from them.\n\nbut I've been out of highschool for over a year and I'm in job corps working towards getting computer degrees.\n\nI still remember the shit she did to me, and I'm still trying to get over it.\n\n\\---NeekoWolfie", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I was coming from running errands and walked up behind her. She was writing and sitting with her dog on the grass by the lake around the corner from my house. I was on the walking path about 10 feet away. I recognized her by her hairstyle and her dog.\n\nAs far as I know, she never saw me.\n\nI felt almost nothing. As soon as I recognized her, I giggled to myself about the 9-10 months I burned through with her, jacked up the music in my headphones, and kept walking.\n\nI will say the only thing I did feel was sorry for her. But, it was not the kind of feeling sorry that would cause me to reach out to her. I felt sorry that she lives the way she does, churning through people, and basically only forming relationships on the basis of what somebody can do for her in a given moment. Churning through narcissistic supply. She'd told me about other people she'd dated, so it's clear that this is her pattern.\n\nBut, I offer this anecdote as a thank you to everybody here for telling their stories and as I\u2019ve been healing over the last couple of months (especially through this forum and therapy), reassuring me that I wasn\u2019t alone. Reassuring me that what I experienced with her was not driven by anything I did or didn\u2019t do other than what I tolerated. \n\nI also offer this story as proof you can move on from your narcissistic ex and get to a point where seeing them makes you laugh to yourself about that bygone era, but nothing more. I didn\u2019t suddenly miss her or start reminiscing about bakeries we used to frequent together. This is true even though I was literally holding a slice of cake from a bakery she introduced me to. I\u2019ve been able to disconnect her from that bakery and fully enjoy it on my own. When I saw her, I didn\u2019t even get angry despite everything she started to cost me personally and professionally during our relationship. \n\nSo, you really \\*can\\* get past a narcissistic ex and grow into a healthier person, partly because of the experience you had with them.\n\nThrough that experience, I learned to trust my gut and listen to what it\u2019s telling me. At the beginning of our relationship, I remember telling her once I felt like she was gaslighting me, but she convinced me she wasn\u2019t. That was the beginning of not trusting myself and getting lost in her abuse. The experience with her was bad enough where I don\u2019t picture myself ever discounting that feeling again.\n\nHappily, I am connecting to other people, and do a lot better with listening to my gut. I have learned.\n\nAnd out of everything today, I am proudest of how I refused to let myself look back at her. \n\nWhen you move on, don\u2019t look back.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I just got out of a 4+ year long relationship with a blatant narcissist. He even owned up to it but almost seemed proud of it. The slight self awareness gave me hope, but of course, things only got worse instead of better. Anyways, there was a lot of emotional abuse. He made me feel so meaningless and like a failure of a person. I felt like a burden every day. I was on the brink of suicide when things ended, and when they did I woke up the next day feeling immediately stable and like myself again. Other people noticed pretty quickly too, and a lot of my friendships have come back to me. All those dark thoughts went away, and I've been really making my healing a priority in the almost 3 months since the break up.\n\nI've been mostly focusing on the bad in the process of moving on because I spent so many years focusing on the positives and trying to bury all those things down, including a pretty brutal rape and ongoing sexual violence. It was really, really bad. But as all of you know, there were also parts that were good. That's how they lure you in, that's part of why you stay. I got my art supplies out this weekend and found some old letters in that drawer from years ago, before things got really out of control. Just little birthday cards, not any big long love letters, although I know I have a few of those somewhere too. It just kind of took me by surprise. I've been healing really well and haven't cried about things in weeks, but it made me remember the good that kept me strung along for so long, reminded me that this person I thought existed didn't really exist, and made me really sad.\n\nI feel like this is a question with an obvious answer, but should I throw all of this out?\n\nI guess the bigger question here is...will there ever be a point where it would be healthy to reminisce on the happy, fun, just good slivers of the relationship?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for your responses. I think you guys are all right, I probably need to just toss everything out. I'm not sure if I'm ready yet, but maybe I can invite a friend over for support and get rid of everything.

You did what you wanted to my body without thinking of the consequences. It wasn\u2019t the first time you had done it, but it was that last.

My parents were playing poker and we had come home early to talk. Instead, you pushed me face down into my own pillows and raped me until you were done. I got up and cried in my shower for half an hour. I blamed myself. I didn\u2019t fight you. I just froze like a deer in the headlights. My brain couldn\u2019t comprehend what was happening. You knew what you did because you tried playing the victim like you always did. I consoled you after you raped me. You sat on the edge of the guest bed crying. You admitted it to me on the phone about a year later. I used to think that you stole something inside of me, but my worth is something not so easily taken. I had night terrors for a few years after. I would wake up in cold sweats panicking, thinking you were behind me. The hairs on the back of my neck still prickle when someone comes up behind me. I was finally able to tell my family about all of it. I stopped protecting you because I was no longer afraid of you. Thank you for allowing the dead pieces inside of you to come to the surface that night. It was the final push i needed to leave.

(it wasn\u2019t one of those conveyor checkouts)\n- Narc: (perceives it as a slight) No. why can\u2019t you grab it from there?\n- Cashier: look, there\u2019s a long line behind you, and it would make my job a little easier if you just pushed the bottle along a bit.\n- Narc: NO, that\u2019s YOUR job. Don\u2019t ask me to move it. YOU can grab it from there, don\u2019t make me do YOUR job....

This was not the first time he\u2019s blown up at strangers or service providers. He\u2019s yelled at cashiers of waiters before.\n\nI panicked, left the line, went to put back the wine I had grabbed and left the store, hoping he wouldn\u2019t call out to me as I passed him.\n\nSorry, this post has become long and I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m looking for. Maybe I just needed to vent. Am I wrong in preferring to spend time with friends? I suppose that does make me a shitty wife.

The one who made this video actually compares them to a narcissist, and the big difference is that a narcissists will do things to intentionally hurt their partner, with a dismissive doesn\u2019t do such things on purpose, and doesn\u2019t enjoy those things, even if both of their actions are identical. There is more information about this and some great videos on YouTube, which I unfortunately can\u2019t provide a link for on here..\n\nThis is relevant to me because I recently dated someone who I had very intimate encounters with, who I suspect is a dismissive. Although we never had a commitment to each other, there definitely was a connection and it was great when we met. He pushed away and it pushed me more to him, it was intense and a lot and it felt so unfair for me. I was hurt and confused and depressed (still dealing with these feelings somewhat), while he began to tell me I was sensitive and intense. Dismissives usually pair with people with the anxious-preoccupied attachment, which I suspect I am, not 100% because I\u2019ve learned to cope with it, but I think it gets triggered a lot more when I\u2019m in a situation like this. A lot of people in relationships with a narcissists are either with the anxious-preoccupied attachment style, or will develop this during the relationship. \n\nApparently both of these attachment styles stem from childhood and the way your parents treated you growing up. There are treatments for this, either with a therapist or indulging yourself in self love (this is for the anxious one at least, not sure about the other).

It all started when I was in the car with my family. I had my earphones in and couldn\u2019t hear my mum talking to me and my dad got really mad at me saying that \u201cI thought I was entitled or something\u201d,  and kept rambling on. hat was about as much as I heard after taking out my earphones. (Prior to this incident my dad was already really mad at work). My mum knew I couldn\u2019t hear her and stood up for me but didn\u2019t really say anything after. Normally I talk back to my dad and cry really easily but recently every time my parents get mad at me I just freeze and my face becomes completely emotionless. I didn\u2019t know what to say to him so I kept quiet. When he stopped driving I immediately went in another car with my mum and my dad was mad saying that I was starting an argument even though I was just trying to cool off and not cause any problems. After we got home my little brother told me that he called me a \u201csulking girl\u201d and I\u2019m pretty sure he thought I was spoiled and unreasonable. \n\nAt night I was watching a movie with my brothers and I was telling them how I hated a certain movie and my dad walked in the room and asked 2 times \u201cyou hate your dad right?\u201d Like before, I froze and my blank expression came on again. I was really tired and didn\u2019t want to fight with him and said nothing again. I did frown a little though when he said that. He literally went off at me saying how \u201cI thought I was the king of the world\u201d. I was entitled and won\u2019t listen to anyone. My mum came in and asked what was going on. I was getting upset at this point because I had said NOTHING to him and he went off. He claimed that I was ignoring him and I told him what did he want me to say to that? He continued to shout at me before telling me he was done with me. My mum the. Proceeded to say \u201cyou were probably showing him attitude again\u201d. \n\nI don\u2019t get it. I tried so hard not to say anything or start any arguments and I still got in trouble. I\u2019m just trying to survive in this household without my parents getting mad at me. Even my mum thinks I was doing something wrong. I don\u2019t want to start anything I just want to get through every day without them yelling at me. When I was younger I used to fight back but now I\u2019m at a loss.\n\nTBL: Dad got mad at me for something so minuscule.

Since then, here are some consistent behaviors.\n\n     He literally never accepts fault with anything. Every single time we have an argument he says some variation of \"this is all your fault, I hope youre happy. We are fighting because of you\" \n\n     He totally emotionally withdraws. Any time he gets mad he refuses to talk to me for days at a time. When I say something like \"hey we really need to talk\" he will say \"I don't care. I don't want to talk to you. I don't even want to be around you.\" And he constantly reinforces that he doesn't care. Any time I approach him he repeats it over and over. \n\n     If I decide I need to get out of the house because of all the tension he gets majorly pissed and accuses me of cheating or insinuates it. He will say \"hope you had fun with whatever you were doing. You go ahead and have fun with whoever it is.\" He hates when I leave the environment. He refuses to have anything to do with me and it's really hurtful and I feel like I can't stay around him at that time. He also gets mad when I stay in the bedroom, but I don't feel that I can roam the house with all the negative energy! \n\n     He laughs when I cry! Sometimes I try so hard to talk to him and he rejects me so harshly. It hurts and I have ended up crying. He seriously laighed at me and on multiple occassions. \n\n     He constantly throws therapy in my face. He mocks me about it. Yesterday I asked him if we could have a conversation and he told me that's what I have a therapist for. \n\n     He hates my friends and gets angry any time I see them. I only have 3 friends. I have no family anymore. He hates all 3 of them. One of them he has never met, he just says he hates her because she's part of my past. I've been firm in not allowing him to control that, but if I'm being honest, I don't do a lot of things because the backlash from him isn't worth it. \n\n     Those are just some of the behaviors. I feel like I'm making a book, but I'd love a weigh in from others. I can't decide if it's emotional abuse or if he's just an ass when he's mad. On a day to day basis he's great, but times like this make it really hard to tolerate him.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I came to the realization that I have a very low self esteem and self confidence. When I saw a therapist (both at college and home) I concluded that it was because of nature and I inherited many of my illnesses genetically from my dad. I didn\u2019t give much but passing consideration to the nurture factor but I\u2019m now reconsidering my thoughts. \nUpon further research into the latent effects of verbal (STRICTLY VERBAL, nothing physical) abuse I discovered that it is the root of many of my mental health issues. Re-examining my childhood I repressed a lot of negative memories and emotions that my dad, who suffers from mental issues himself, put on me and my twin brother. I was verbally abused for many years and still am to this day. It has completely changed my perspective on my early life and my issues today. \nThe issue I\u2019m facing is I am at college and aside from talking to my parents and a counselor here I feel completely lost. I think a good portion of my life was a lie and I have theories that my dad manipulated my school choices leading me to choose a school where I\u2019m not very happy at. I don\u2019t know what to think and I have seen my trust issues come to fruition as I feel like I don\u2019t trust my friends at school, or home for that matter. The only people I completely trust is my twin brother and until recently my mom (that trust has been mentally eroded by the discovery that she potentially let my dad verbally abuse my for years). \nI want to reach out to her and vent but I\u2019m afraid that a) my school friends will hear and be weirded out b) I\u2019ll be dismissed by my mom c) I don\u2019t want to have to confront these scary emotions and potentially derail my life, brother life and parental relationships. d) I don\u2019t want to deal with the fallout from such a heavy accusation \nI am lost, I hate having to be both the victim and the person responsible for taking care of a mess I never wanted to have.\nBut seeing that my abuse is the root cause for a litany of issues, including but not limited to depression, anxiety, social anxiety, fear of rejection, and major trust issues. Also seeing that these problems, caused by abuse, have negatively affected a love interest of mine which I was too afraid to purse and lost out on and I think about daily, I need to find the guts to speak out now or further risk my mental health. I can\u2019t keep putting on this mask and tell myself it will be alright or things will get better. But I am feeling more alone, lost, and judged than ever before.\nTl;dr I am a college sophomore just coming to terms with childhood emotional abuse that is the root of my depression and I need to find the guts to speak out.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I'm so confused on what I should call this so I'm here to ask for advice. when I was a child I grew up with a lot of abuse around me. My mum was abused by my dad and so was I. My dad was sex  addict I believe because of all the pornography he had laying around our house (tapes and magazines ect). At the age of 5-6 I seen full on sex in videos and on channels my dad somehow installed into the tv. My brother was also exposed to it for a long time. We were just kids so we didn't get what it was but we knew it must of felt good. First thing that started everything was when i was alone and my brother came to the room. He is 1 year older than me.  I was sitting on my bed then he got in top of me, I dont remember much but all I remember was he took my hand and made me touch myself and I did. He was 8 and I was 7.  He and I didnt know at all what we were doing we just knew this felt good, but now I know it was wrong amd i feel ahamed and uncomfortable about it. I dont blame my brother though I know he was too young to understand anything or what he was doing. I dont think he remembers this happening. \n\nSo as I grew up I wanted to feel more of this good feeling again. at around 8-9  I met a girl we're were like best friends. One day I told her all about all these things i saw and next minute you know we trying it out our selves. We played games that was of her being the one to be pleased while I was the servent to please her. For a while I thought it was ok. This was something that made you feel good. I know it was my fault but i didn't know. However, when I learnt it was wrong finally, I felt disgusted,still do till this day and when she tried to make me do it with her agian when she came over I cried and told her that this was wrong.  That what we were doing was not right. She was angry and left. At the same time my mum and her mum had a falling out so I never saw her again. \n\nAll of this exposure and things that have been done has effected me more than I thought. I dont know if i was sexually abused or if i was not. Maybe  all of this was my fault. I feel guilty for a lot of things i have done and confused. I went to therapy for 3 years but never spoke of this because half the things I said here I believed that it was normal for child to go through but now I know it isn't. Please someone explain to me or give me some sort of input on this. I dont feel comfortable talking about it to someone in real life.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I've known her and her sister for as long as I can remember and she has almost became like another family member in the house. Her dad is my great uncle, my grandpa's brother, but I have never really liked that side of the family. They are very traditional in how they treat girls and expect us to be exactly how they were when they were younger. Now for some background. Her dad, who I will call John, is very crude with his words and threaten them constantly. Her mom, who I think is an amazing lady, has been trying to get away for a while, but her family lives in another state. Also the place we all live at is a very farming community. So they were also into rodeos and had about 15 horses along with some other farm animals. John would also threaten them with their animals if they tried to get away. Last summer, I got a text from Gray saying that her sister and mom packed up and left. Apparently, Gray's mom was on the phone with John and he started to yell at them. Made comments about how the kids wouldn't feel bad if he just killed himself and a lot of other hateful comments. So Gray's mom called up her family from another state, the state is pretty close maybe close to 3 hours, and they helped her pack up all the animals that were under their name and all their stuff. They only left pictures of John, his stuff, and the only horse that was in his name. They went to go stay with Gray's grandparents on her mom's side in the other state as they started to file for divorce. John started to call the kids and say very rude things and tell them that he would get them back. They are still going to court, but things are looking in Gray's favor. She does, however, have to come back every other weekend for visitation. My family made a promise to her mom that we would help Gray and her sister if anything bad happens and she can't get to them. There has been three different times Gray has called me to be on standby. Lately, Gray usually stays at my house for as long as John will let her and her sister at her own friends house. We also said her sister can come at anytime. Lately, it's odd to not see her at our house on those weekends. Also, whenever she needs to grab something from her house, she brings me. John likes to put on mask of being the perfect father when others are around. He acts nice when someone else is around, but then tells us when Gray leaves that her and her sister will be living with him again. Now somethings get worse. John had a feud going on with my grandparents for as longs as I can remember. They couldn't even stop fighting as their saint of a sister passed away to cancer. I don't take either sides because I don't like my grandparents or anyone on my dad's side except for Gray's mom and sister and another cousin. My grandma is someone who only does something if it benefits her or makes her look good. They act like they like us then make up false rumors. Her and my aunts use to leave the room when my mom entered and use to purposely leave my sisters and I out of cousin stuff. Then she acts like a saint. Pretending that she gives a shit about us and brings up my sister, who has autism and down syndrome, and pretends that she is such a great grandmother to her so she can gain some sort of status with her old lady church friends. Newsflash, she isn't. Anyways, they started to get along with John again since the divorce started and John's and my grandpa's mom died. My grandma think she can get something out of their mom's will if she's friendly with him. John thinks it looks good that Gray has an aunt and uncle up here to be with to the court. Even though Gray has only met them during the divorce. Also, when Gray's grandmother died, her mom was going to drive them to the funeral while she stayed in the car. This was only a few weeks after they ran off, so she was scared John was going to force them back home. My parents agreed to stay near them(I was as well going to stay with them) and my dad wouldn't let him get away with taking them. My dad's a big intimidating country person so it would of probably worked. Well, John called them up and said they weren't welcomed there. My family still went but it was awkward since John probably still knew we were talking to them. Gray and John often get in fights. Gray won't take any of the shit John has been giving her. He has told her that she was going to hell, she was a bitch, that they didn't even care that his mom died, and other awful things. They even have recordings of phone calls, but those aren't allowed in court. John yells at Gray's sister until she cries. John knows that he has no control over Gray, so he tries to manipulate her younger sister by screaming threats at her. He also gets angry if they don't greet their half sister(38) when she immediately walks in. He has also threaten to give Gray a whoopin, even though she is way too old for one of those. Recently this last weekend, she told my mom and I that he had threaten her with one. She said that she told him that she would call the cops if he did. He then said that she would beat her even more once he got out of jail. My mom and I were horrified and reestablished that we would always be okay with coming and getting her if anything happened. While my dad thinks we shouldn't get involved he wouldn't stand for this. They are about a 5 min car ride away and their mom is 3 hours away on those weekends and not allowed to infer with visitation. He has also affected their school life by not allowing them to go home early for some school functions like sports. The sister was a freshman on varsity, but had to be kicked off because he would allow her to go back for tournaments. However things look pretty good for them in court. Gray's mom won the appeal for them to stay with her in the other state, but they still currently have to keep visiting him. John has recently got a new attorney and is reopening the appeal case and saying that they stole his horses, even though none of them are in his name, so he has no case. They are hoping hold John in contempt of court because he was ordered to pay both of his side and her mom's side of mediation, but has only paid his. He also doesn't have the girls on insurance even though the court ordered this a long time ago. He also was suppose to stay away from booze, since he use to say awful things while drunk to them, but has some stashed in his barn. My question is what else can they do? Are they old enough to deny going to stay with him yet? Can they convince the court anymore that he is unsafe? They have recorded phone calls, but those aren't allowed in court unless they have his permission which he will never give.\n\nEdit: Also, just recently learned, he's behind on all payments. 28000 behind on the house. He also has put their half-sister against them and that same sister is helping John financially. Gray also has pictures of texts of her sister and dad talking bad about them. John is also lying about having another woman in his life and Gray has found photos on facebook on the lady's page at the house. He also is convincing one of the leader's in the church that he's a good dad and sent Gray and her sister to talk to him. All the church leader said when she explained what happened was that he still loved them and they need to understand that. Which disappointed me a bit since this church leader is a very good friend of my dad's and I expected him not to play into John's game. tl;dr What more can my friend do to get away from emotionally abusive father?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

A lot of the other kids in my neighborhood hated me only because of my skin tone lighter than they were, and I was bullied a lot, but it was something that I\u2019d gotten used too.\n\nWhen I was ten years old, I was told that we were moving again. My dad was in the Air Force, and we often moved, so I was used to it. But this time, he sent me to a family friend's house in order to finish the school year, and then I would join him at the new station. \n\nLet\u2019s call this woman, Samantha. She was a single mom of three and had known my dad for a long time. Samantha had offered to watch me for the next few months until school was over. I was okay with that because her son was my friend, and her two older girls seemed pretty nice.\n\nPretty nice\u2026 that\u2019s funny now.\n\nTo put things into context, Samantha\u2019s two girls\u2026 we will call them Sharon and Amber were 17 and 18 years old. They liked to sneak out at night and roam the city. It was Philadelphia, and things could get dangerous at night, but they would always sneak out after dark and want to drag me with them.\n\nSamantha worked double shifts and was hardly ever home. I am sure my dad didn\u2019t know this, because if he did, then he wouldn\u2019t have let me stayed there. \n\nAnyways\u2026\n\nOne night, Sharon and Amber were talking with their friends about how they could make some extra money. They were hanging out with their older friends, and I was simply there because they were supposed to be watching me. There were four other men and two other girls with them. So, including myself, there were nine people total, sitting in the attic of the house talking.\n\nSharon and Amber continued smoking, drinking beer, and talking about making more money to buy weed. Then one of the guys said how about her, pointing at me. He told them he would give them $25 to take me into the other room. They didn\u2019t even hesitate, and just agreed and told me to do whatever he said, or they would make me sorry. I was scared, but the guy took me by the hand and led me to the other room.  \n\nAlone in the room, there was only a bed and a TV, like I said this was the attic. The boy, who looked like he went to college, sat me down on the bed and then sat next to me. He told me that my skin was so pretty and that he had a weakness for light skin girls. He tried to kiss me, but I didn\u2019t know what to do. Then he asked me about my breast, because they were beginning to develop, but were still pretty big for my age. I didn\u2019t know the answers to these questions; I was only ten.\n\nHe laid me down, telling me that he would be as gentle as possible, but this was going to hurt a bit. Then he took off my shorts, bra, and shirt, leaving me naked on the bed. I saw his hand jerking himself off as he stared at me, then when he was hard, he shoved two fingers inside of me. I remember tearing up because of the pain. But he told me that this would make it easier for when he entered me. \n\nNow, I was taught about good touch and bad touching at school, but they don\u2019t teach you about the fear, or that your body could shut down or even about all of the confusion you experience when being molested or raped. They didn\u2019t teach you about how your body could respond either.\n\nThe guy pulled his pants and underwear off and spread my legs. He slid his penis inside me slowly, and he was right, it hurt. I started to cry as he went deeper inside me and moved in and out. I was hurting and embarrassed and just laid there until he finished. And not to get too gross, but he actually finished inside of me. He said it was okay because I hadn\u2019t had my period yet. But what was worse, I could hear Amber, Sharon, and the others giggling and listening while this was going on.\n\nWhen he was done, the man got up and left. I laid in the bed, mostly because every part of me hurt. Then a few moments later, I felt like I was being watched. I turned around and saw another one of Sharon\u2019s friends standing there. He said that he paid to be next. \n\nThat began my nightmare, Sharon and Amber used me to make money for them until my dad game to pick me up. When he saw me, he was horrified that I was so skinny and looked a mess, but Samantha convinced him that I had the flu and was recovering. I never told him what happened. I just couldn\u2019t stomach the look on his face, know that for a few months his little girl was whored out for cash. I never told anyone for that matter; there isn\u2019t an excellent way to bring that up in a conversation. Besides, people don\u2019t want to hear things like this.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Depending on how long you we're in that relationship or if you're still in it, dating shouldn't be anywhere in the forefront of your mind. Your main focus should be taking care of YOUR needs and YOUR mental,financial,physical, and spiritual health. You need a mandatory cooling off period to unfuck your hypersensitivity and hyper vigilance to narcissists and their personalities. Not everyone is a narc and not everyone is a good match, so you need some time to rediscover yourself and build boundaries. You're not gonna do that swiping left and right on Tinder and Bumble. You need a period where you can lick your wounds, and take stock of who/what you are before you go be with someone else, so that you dont get hurt and you dont hurt someone else. If you're anything like me you used to want a family,wife,kids, the whole 9 yards and now you're completely soured on the idea. Eventually I'm going to come back around to the idea and I'll find a woman get married and have a gaggle of kids, **so will you.**\n\n**Dating sites are a dumpster-fire** where meeting someone is reduced to swiping,scrolling,tapping, and screen shots. For women and men it's a hook up spot, and a place where you fish for validation and conformation bias. Keep your wounded ass off the apps or you're going to find another narc and end up right back on this sub typing another post OR you're going to get your feelings hurt because you dont \"Feel good enough\" or \"Look good enough\". \n\n**You are good enough,you are smart enough,you are pretty enough,tall enough,strong enough.

When I thought that I was healing from the first one, that's when I realized that I was dealing with another narc! The scary part is that they can easily isolate you and you won't even notice that you're being isolated. They'll make you feel small whenever they can. \n\nThe second narcissist once told me that if she took a job offer that she'd be winning less money than me when she had no job. Then she tried to manipulate me by thinking that a guy I'm getting to know better, was being abusive with her when he wasn't. She used my feelings for him against me! It was awful, but I know him well so I knew she was lying. I posted in another sub about the situation and someone told me to look up gray rock technique and I did look it up and without noticing I used that technique on the first narc, it worked wonders! She got bored quickly and left me alone. With the second one, I had to block her because she was defaming my friend who she just met! She was extremely jealous of him. I'm mad at myself for letting this second narc into my life. I should've known better, I met her through the first narc. \n\nI'm trying to heal from all of this, but I'm quite concerned too.

It's the narcissist's game, blame shifting. Narcissists' SOs are usually too empathetic or codependent to shield the blames they are not supposed to take, but for living a independent and parasite-free life, one must learn to play narcissist's game, the blame-shifting.\n\nThe narcissists will try to shift the blame by guilt-trip, silent treatment, anger burst, gas-lighting, etc. Basically they try to create negative emotions on the victim, who's usually an empath or codependent that can't distinguish his/her own emotions between projected emotions. It eats them from inside, makes them self-doubt, and wants to self-correct to ease the guilt/self-doubt/uncomfortableness. Once the empath/codependent takes the bait, the negative feelings are removed, but the blames are taken unfairly by them, creates long-term consequences and taker-giver dynamics.\n\nSo it's important for empath/codependents to learn the techniques of blame shifting. The principle is simple: stick with your blames and never give in. Sit with it silently (don't take projected blames), or insist it over and over (instead of taking blames, throwing blames). The self-doubt, the guilt, the fear all fade with time and time alone. It may take hours, days, weeks or even months, but the clarity will always come eventually.\n\nIt's a scary move and creates a lot of anxiety. But it's the only way to shake off the projected false blame. It took me tears and shakiness to practice, but it's well-worth it. Power-up my confidence while maintaining my grace really helped me.

Every time I tried to point out how much your abuse hurt me, you replied with 'well you didn't make my life easy either'. I was 0-15 years old at any given point you're referring to. I lived my life under your iron fist that you disguised as care. I began to believe that the suffocating feeling of terror was synonymous with unconditional love. I lived my life unwillingly worshiping at your altar. You were a jealous god and didn't hesitate to make it known.\n\nThe clinical term for the vast majority of your offenses is 'gaslighting'. It's telling someone that they're crazy when they confront you with something you don't like. That's oversimplifying it, but you get it. What's especially heinous about it is that the consequences never really go away. I will spend the rest of my life questioning my memories because you taught me that they were unreliable. \n\nYou tried to poison me against my family. You told me, a 12-year-old with no confidence or idea of self-worth, that I needed a fuck-buddy to build confidence. I wasn't even in high school. You were pregnant at 18, my sister was pregnant at 17, and I was well on my way to continuing the cycle and being pregnant at 16. I was a child. I can still barely handle myself and who I am, there's no way I would've been able handle a kid. Especially with your parenting advice.\n\nSome of your greatest hits:\n\n* Not buying groceries for two weeks because I made you angry. You would go get yourself food (McDonald's mostly), come home with drink cups just to let me know. I survived off a box of instant mashed potatoes. Then you got angry at me for developing an eating disorder six months later.\n* Kidnapping me from my dad and running away to a Betty Griffin House. We lived there for at least a month, and I never had any idea why. I only found out recently that you KIDNAPPED me.\n* Allowed one of your homicidal/suicidal ex's into the house while I was home, after I had told you he scared me. Then you dropped me off with my dad, barefoot and in my pajamas, at 10 pm.\n* Blackmailing me with a school scholarship.\n* Getting angry when you were not invited to my confirmation/birthday parties/graduation/etc. On multiple of those I tried to invite you, but you made some outrageous demand that I was unwilling to accommodate. Instead of caving to you, I rescinded my invitation and you sulked.\n* Put me on medication at 10, for the wrong things, which made me scared of medication. It was only when I was 19 and survived a suicide attempt that I realized I might actually need help.\n* Allowed your boyfriend to sleep over, naked, with the door open. Not a problem normally, but you knew I had night terrors. I ran in one night and was greeted with the full-frontal nudity of your current beau.\n* Telling my dad you hoped his cancer would kill him when he went with the divorce decree and refused to pay you after he was required to.\n\nMy personal favorite:\n\n* In order to meet your eldest child's $25,000 bond (which you had NO way of ever hoping to do), you raised $5,000 and slept with the bondsman. Her bond was revoked a month later and she was arrested for trying to run from the law.\n\nI will never be sorry for outing you as the disgusting piece of garbage that you are. I will never be sorry for standing up and saying what you did to me. I have forgiven you though. But you want to know what forgiveness is not? Stupidity. I have forgiven you, but I will not allow you back into my life. You've done enough damage, I don't need anything else to talk about in therapy.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I started having feelings for my classmate. At that time, we were starting to get a little closer because his seat was shifted next to mine. \n\nOne day, I was at the library, studying alone at a quiet corner. My crush felt me up for a long while and grabbed my crotch. I told him to stop, but made no physical move to resist - While part of me liked him, another part of me didn't want his advances. He teased me for getting hard on the way back to class. \n\nAbout a week later, in the middle of class, he started groping me.  It was easy for him to do because we were sitting at the back of the class.  It was embarrassing, and all I could muster was to say his name and glare at him. He did this a few more times, and became more daring each time. While I felt confused and violated, I never mustered the courage to say no, out of fear that he would out me/embarrass me (he never directly threatened me, though). I would eventually cum for the first time in my life with his hands in my pants.\n\nEventually, what we did became consensual (remember that I had a huge crush on him), and I even let him come over to my house once. \n\nOf course, it ended in heartbreak - when I confessed my feelings to him, he told me was straight. Then, for the next few months, he proceeded to pretend I didn't exist, besides saying the occasional \"hello\". As if the heartbreak and trauma wasn't enough - once, I mustered up the courage and confronted him about everything that happened, but he just laughed it off. \n\nDespite all my hurt, I actually hooked up with him twice after the incident. I wonder if I was trying to convince myself that everything we did was consensual? \n\nMy memories of everything that happened are getting fuzzier and fuzzier. It's easy to question if I had just made everything up, making me feel very guilty and confused. The many grey areas in the situation often make things worse.

We ate at a restaurant and then came back to my place after the whole day (we had left at around 10h30 am and came back at 6h00pm). We had done nothing to infuriate my mom or her boyfriend. So I live on the top floor of an apartment building so while we walk up the stairs, I notice how the janitor had removed the window net (for flies and such) and left the window opened, except we've had a crazy number of spiders (like about a hundred baby spiders and big spiders on the top floor's window and lamp and it was disgusting and the janitor never did anything about until I complained) so I point it out to my boyfriend and say \"hey, they finally cleaned the window, but they left the net off and the window opened so it'll be hell by tomorrow..\". So we open my apartment's door and my mom just goes \"ah, we can know it's you coming up the stairs because you cause a damn earthquake everytime you walk\" and her boyfriend laughed and said \"oh no I recognized her because she was complaining as always\". To give you some context, I'm chubby and really insecure about my weight plus I just got out of years of abuse at my father's place (like everyday I would get yelled at and pointed out every flaw, no rest at all it was horrible at home and at school because I was also getting bullied and school never did shit about it so let's just say I'm depressive and suicidal and my mom knows about it) so I'm really fragile, but I'm trying to stay positive and kind to let myself heal a bit (which is not really working because of my mom, but im trying so that's what counts most). So after that I went to the bathroom and my mom's boyfriend suddenly needed to go (note that we had just arrived and they had the whole day and afternoon to go but as soon as I went to the bathroom he needed to go) and my mom was like \"ah she's probably be there for a while, probably ate too much crap today\" and my boyfriend just had enough (he's been with me through the worse part of my abuse at my dad's and is now seeing my mom start being mentally abusive towards me too and really does not like it) and he said \"okay guys leave it no need for those comments.\" And my mom got mad and started bitching and they left to get my mom's bf back to his place since we were Sunday. So this morning I try to talk to her about it and I say \"what you said yesterday hurt me. Saying I cause an earthquake when I come up the stairs makes me think about my weight and all and it really hurt me. Plus your boyfriend telling me I always complain was unnecessary.\" And she fucking lost it. She started saying things like \"omg it was a fucking joke can't you take a joke???\" , \"stop being so negative, you're stuck in the past (referring to my abuse) and can't stop being depressed!\" And stuff like that. Then she started pointing out every little thing I don't do (she doesn't realise when I do my laundry since she's at work when I do it and other stuff like that) like the laundry and everything. Basically she started blaming me for disliking her comment yesterday and told me to move on because it was just a joke and it's my problem if I can't take a joke properly.\n\nI've been feeling really shitty ever since this morning because of it and I can't stop wondering if she was right and I should've just taken it as a joke.

It keeps playing in my head over and over and I felt compelled to share.\n\n\\---\n\nIt was earlier this year, in June.  We had started to split up, and the plan was for us to both move out of our condo and live elsewhere.  That week, I had already moved the kids out and had them stay with my mom. Meanwhile, I was staying in the condo with my NEX for a week while we decided how to split up our stuff and get everything packed.  The split had been agreed to a few months beforehand but emotions were still fresh for me, and I spent every night that week on the couch downstairs crying myself to sleep.\n\nOne night it was particularly bad for me and my NEX came downstairs, sat next to the couch, and held my hand.  He said something along the lines of \"I know I haven't been there for you the way you've needed me to be and you've spent a lot of nights crying alone.  So, even though this isn't what we are anymore, let me stay here and hold your hand so tonight at least you're not crying alone.\"\n\n\"Won't that just make us both feel bad?\" I say.\n\n\"It actually makes me feel a little bit better,\" he says, \"to know that you have feelings about us ending.  &lt;affair partner&gt; won't talk to me, and she just doesn't seem to care about me at all anymore.\"\n\nI look up at him and he is practically beaming, which makes me feel uncomfortable since I'm a sobbing mess.  But i'm used to telling him everything.  So, in spite of that, I start spilling my guts about how terrible I feel about everything.  How much I miss him, how lonely I have been, how angry I am with him, how I'm afraid for our children, that I'm fearful I won't be able to support myself, how scary it will be to move, that I'm devastated about losing his family, everything.\n\nAnd then I notice something.\n\nWhen I'm saying something that is just about how hard life will be for me as a divorcee, or fears for myself, he is there holding my hand, and looking at me. When I start to say anything about being upset with him or anything critical of him, he lets my hand drop, and is looking away clearly annoyed. Each time he pulled away I had this awful feeling and started to feel desperate to get him to hold my hand again.\n\n\"Oh my God\", I think, \"he's using his affection to condition me to stop saying anything bad about him.\"\n\nAs that thought was processing in my head, I said something about how I'm worried about how the kids will handle not growing up in a home with their mom and dad. He very nonchalantly says \"Well I heard kids do much better with a single parent household than in a two parent household where the parents don't get along.\"  He wasn't wrong, but he said it so matter of factly, and without any shred of emotion, it chilled me.\n\n\"He doesn't even care about how the kids react,\" I think.\n\nAfter he said that, I sat up, and told him.  \"Thank you, but I'd like you to leave me alone now.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\" he asks.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe gets upset, stands up, and just says, \"Wow, well now you know why there isn't anyone in your life.  You think you're too good for anyone and push them away.\"  And he huffs back upstairs to our bed to sleep with a sarcastic \"Goodnight!\"\n\n\\---\n\nI don't think I ever saw the manipulation as clearly before as I did on that day.\n\nI've been slowly putting up better boundaries and getting better since that day three months ago, and his games don't make me react viscerally anymore.  I'm so grateful he let his mask slip so much that night.  Had it played out differently I might have gotten sucked back yet again instead of being free.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I\u2019m worried that my girlfriends sister is in an abusive relationship. Not physically abusive, which is a silver lining, but psychologically. I\u2019m not sure if it does quite stretch to abuse and I apologise if I\u2019m overreacting especially compared to what some people here will have experienced. \n\nShe is 22 and her boyfriend is the same. I\u2019ll refer to her as N and him as A. She pretty much lives with him at his parents house now they\u2019ve finished uni, and goes back to their mums house occasionally. This is where I hear about their relationship either through my girlfriend or first hand if I happen to be there, which I was this weekend. We had a long conversation about it for a couple of hours and there were some red flags which have caused me to worry. The following points are just as I remember them, so will jump around in severity and stuff. \n\nHe is from a well off family and N is not. They both got summer jobs at the same place, but he decided on his first trial shift that he didn\u2019t want to work over summer and managed to lose both of them their jobs. Since then, when she brings up wanting to get a job, he tries to talk her out of it. They\u2019re going to work a ski season in France from September and he says it\u2019s not worth it. His mum payed for his rent while he was at uni and she still gives him this money, but N has no income. \n\nHe cheated on her with a friend of theirs. He initially told the other girl he wasn\u2019t going to tell N about it, but changed his mind and told her \u2018she won\u2019t leave me anyway\u2019. Annoyingly, she proved him right by staying with him. She said that she\u2019s thought from the start that he\u2019d cheat on her (he talks to other girls a lot, when they\u2019re out and on Instagram and stuff) and he\u2019d convinced her it was in her head. She said she was mostly relieved that she hadn\u2019t been imagining things. She also said he doesn\u2019t seem to think he\u2019s done anything wrong.\n\nHe is very manipulative, claiming he can \u2018get anyone to like him\u2019 (not true, I\u2019ve always found something off about him). An example she gave was he was talking to a girl who had a Donnie darko tattoo, and he was saying how he loves the film and has designed some tattoos he\u2019s planning to get, despite being against tattoos, bad at art and not having seen the movie. When he cheated on her he asked her if they split up if they could pretend they were still together, basically so he could sleep around but his family and their friends would still think he was the perfect boyfriend. \n\nThey\u2019ve brought a van together and are doing it up to go travelling in. It was \u00a34500, she payed 2500 and his mum gave him the other 2000. He then acts like it is his van, despite him not having payed anything for it (he has since payed for some of the stuff to do it up). He is from a \u2018traditional\u2019 (read: sexist) family, so he doesn\u2019t listen to her advice despite the fact she has more DIY experience than him and has generally been right, and even to the point where she was made to make lunch for him and his dad while they worked on it. They\u2019ve also agreed that if they split up, and sell the van, she\u2019ll get just her \u00a32500 back and he\u2019ll keep any profit they make on it, which seems crazy to me. \n\nShe was upset recently about feeling trapped there and she was crying in bed next to him. She assumed he didn\u2019t realise, but they had an argument later on and he said that he\u2019d known she was crying and just not done anything. He\u2019s also more than once laughed in her face while she\u2019s cried. He\u2019s punched walls in arguments to try and scare her too. His parents have told her that they\u2019ve noticed the way he speaks to her, and even tried to sit them down and talk about it which lead to him storming off multiple times and refusing to see that he\u2019d done anything wrong or apologise. \n\nHe\u2019s made her send back clothes she ordered that he didn\u2019t like (one of the items he later liked the photo of another girl he knows wearing it) and told her she can\u2019t wear certain shoes to an event (which hasn\u2019t happened yet so we\u2019ll see what she does). She said that she\u2019s realised lately that she doesn\u2019t feel like herself, she doesn\u2019t wear clothes and makeup she normally would, until she goes back to her mums and then begins to feel more like herself. \n\nHe got pissed off with her when she left their hotel once to get some space and walked down the road to the seafront at about 6:30am claiming it wasn\u2019t safe, despite her being spitting distance from the hotel and in a place she knows well, but when they were out in a strange town, he was happy to let her leave on her own in the middle of the night to find her own way back. She said about doing driving lessons or even getting a moped so she doesn\u2019t feel as trapped but he talked her out of it claiming it was dangerous (this to me feels like trying to keep her dependant on him for transport and not wanting her to have that freedom). \n\nWhen they got together, she had not long been out of a relationship and was at a low ebb, and was planning on being single for a while (which I think, and she agreed, would have done her the world of good). However despite her saying no, I think he pressured her a bit while she wasn\u2019t in a good state because they ended up together. She also said that the various people who lived with them both through uni mostly ended up disliking him, which might be quite telling. \n\nN is the kind of person who will absolutely see the best in everyone, she thinks everyone is a good person, and she even said \u2018I just don\u2019t think he\u2019s a very good person\u2019. \n\nI\u2019m worried because she has a history of depression, self harm and anorexia, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a healthy situation for her. She seems to realise it isn\u2019t right, but doesn\u2019t seem to be planning to do anything about it. She does know that it\u2019s not all in her head, there is actually something wrong, which is a pretty big step for her. She said she\u2019s happy 90% of the time, but she also said she has to motivate herself to be happy each day, and whenever she started saying about good points in the relationship, she\u2019d follow it up with negative things without being pressed or anything. She\u2019s not done herself any favours, he\u2019s crossed multiple lines that I think would have most people running for the hills, but she\u2019s stayed each time, meaning he knows he can get away with it and potentially get away with worse in the future. Me, my girlfriend and their mum made it clear that we think it\u2019s not healthy and she should leave, but we know that ultimately it comes down to her. I told her that if she ever needs to talk to anyone about anything to please reach out to me, but I know she won\u2019t because I\u2019ve said that many times before. \n\nMy questions are this, 1) am I right to be worried? Is he just an asshole or is there more here? And 2) is there anything else I can/should do?\n\nThanks, sorry again for the length.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Normally you end up defending yourself against the attacks and the original point gets lost.\n\nShe called me an alcoholic (I rarely drink), and said that she \"isn't frightened of me any more and she isn't going to back away even though I'm abusive\" or words to that effect.\n\nI pointed out that she never seemed very frightened of me when we were together when she was standing there screaming and shouting and swearing at me, and if I really was some kind of brute she wouldn't be disappearing til 4-30 am when we were together and she wouldn't be turning up on my doorstep now.\n\nTold her to never come to my home again and not to contact me ever again.\n\nTHEN this morning... Son on his way to school said his mum is picking him up after school to talk, and she already contacted him last night to try and get him to live with her.\n\nIt's not in his best interests to live with her, she's never there, always out \"partying\". But of course it's not about him, it's all about her.\n\nSo I told him it's up to him to decide what he wants because it's all about him being happy, and not to feel pressured to stay with one parent or the other.\n\nWhen she turned up at my house part of the reason I didn't let her in was that son was here, and it's not fair to put him in the middle of this, it's between me and her.\n\nSo it's disapointing that she's imediately drawing him into it to try and manipulate him for her own ends.\n\nWill update with what happens.\n\nFINAL UPDATE: I \\*think\\* I've played a blinder - everything fell into place.\n\nMy 2 concerns were that a) she'd create untold levels of drama and problems, and b) she'd manipulate the son into moving in with her so she didn't have to pay.\n\nWhen she turned up on the doorstep giving me the \"poor me\" speech and asking if I'd \"be reasonable so she didn't end up going bankrupt\" (and yes that's probably what would happen, like all narcs she is so obsessed with \"right now\" that she's terrible with money), I decided to try and solve all problems with one move.\n\nI basically played hardball at first and I wasn't going to budge and she'd have to pay the full amount. But then had a better idea.\n\nI let her stew on that overnight and then the next day said \"right, if you want to stop calling me names and insulting me we can discuss this\" and of course she bit my hand off.\n\nI calculated what it costs to raise son per month, split it in 2 and gave her a figure that worked out at less than half the amount the govt had calculated - I'm not trying to screw her for money, I just want her to contribute a fair amount.\n\nShe's now super happy - actually happy to be paying me the money (whereas before she'd have gone mental if she had to pay $5) since it's far better than she'd worried it would be, I get money towards son, and she then didn't feel the need to have him move in with her - hey that would compromise her social life, right?\n\nSo she thinks she's got a great deal and there will be no drama (told her if there is I'll just go for the full amount), but really I got what I want - contribution to son financially, no hassle from her, and son still lives with me.\n\nI think I was pretty lucky it all worked out like that - could have easily gone the other way.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I feel so inadequate to him everyday, my dad\u2019s Facebook is all about my brother, never me unless I bring it up to him and force him to post about me, and I\u2019m a good kid. I have a 3.58 GPA just got on principals honor role and am in a medical program that has put me ahead of most kids my age, I\u2019ve gotten my CPR certification and many others and he never posts about them. My brother just plays football, he fails his classes to the point where he had to talk to the counselor to see if he got in 8th grade, but I get screamed at if I have a \u201cC.\u201d\n\nIn one recent post, I just got my license, I was so happy and it\u2019s a big milestone, the only mention I got was with a picture of my brother\u2019s broken wrist and my dad saying how it sucks and goes on and on about my brother and at the end it says \u201cB got her license\u201d in a shared post, everybody just cared about my brother\nThe page is like a shrine to my brother, to the point that we went to a family thing on my dads side and none of them knew my name, they only knew my brother, and I\u2019m constantly telling my father that it hurts when he only acknowledges my brother and he said \u201cwell maybe if you did more things, you don\u2019t do anything,\u201d but I did do stuff, I was in my class government, student council, Students against destructive decisions, debate, and I was even a flag girl for football games, but I had to quit every single one because I was in the beginning of high school so they had to pick me up and they\u2019d always be at least a half hour late and they\u2019d yell at me or ignore me the whole ride because I needed to be picked up. My mother even forgot to pick me up for an hour and a half after practice for color guard because she was shopping, but my brother is never late to football nor have they forgotten him. Ever.\n\nbut another thing, I had to forgo a trip that I was a part of to go to France and Italy that my school was hosting, my dad could make the payments but he would be a day or two late because he forgot entirely about it, but he talked me out of going so I can get a car, which I was fine to do, but I\u2019m now being called selfish and inconsiderate by both my mother and father when I have given up so much because I know we struggle, I hear about it all the time, my mother tells me how in debt we are and how much she hates my father and how she wants to divorce him and move out, how he doesn\u2019t provide enough for her to stay at home, and Ive told her multiple times how I don\u2019t wanna hear about this stuff. I skip lunch in school, because of it, I don\u2019t hang out with friends because when I ask for money, even a 5 I get screamed at, but my brother gets a debt of over a 100 dollars and they don\u2019t care. My mom will spend our last 10 dollars and vodka before anything. I asked her one time for water because I was so thirsty and she said she didn\u2019t have the money, but we stopped and she spent the last bit of money on cigarettes. One time I told my father about how she said he was a loser and she found out and called me a back stabber and I betrayed her. She continues to try and get me in trouble. Like for instance, we had stuff to make spaghetti but she wanted burgers, I said \u201cwhy not make spaghetti? We don\u2019t have any bread or anything\u201d she sighs and throws a dish on the floor, screams at me and walks out. My dad comes home and I can hear her from my room \u201cWell she wants spaghetti, she\u2019s being spoiled\u201d and I go out there and try to say no I don\u2019t care, it was a suggestion and my dad starts screaming at me to leave my mother alone. My mother leaves and I try once again to explain what happened and he says \u201cI believe you,n I seen the broken glass on the floor,\u201d but he already screamed at me to the point I cried and went to my room.\n\nNow the real stuff, i feel like I can\u2019t win. Even simple things, like I gave my father my license because I needed a copy made (which he totally forgot about) and I thought it was still in his wallet so I had my mother ask him to put it on my keys and I go out there to ask him and he started screaming at me that I took it and I have it, I told him no, you have it. I check my bag and I do have it and he gets up to hit me and says \u201cI fucking told you\u201d and I flinch and cuss at him and he says \u201cget away from me, go in your room, I don\u2019t wanna see your face.\u201d All because I thought he had my license.\n\nNow back to my brother, he has hit me before, left marks and I hit him back and I\u2019m the one in trouble, so my parents said don\u2019t hit him, but yesterday I asked him nicely to turn down this god awful rap music he was blaring through the house in the living room and he smiled at me and turned it down a single point and I turned off the PlayStation, he then turns it on through a speaker, I take the speaker and walk to my room and my brother starts pushing me into things, I get i shouldn\u2019t have touched it, but my parents don\u2019t discipline him. He called me a bitch and kept pushing me but I finally got in my room without touching him or calling him any names, I then tell my parents and they go off on me. \u201cYou should\u2019ve stayed in your room\u201d \u201cWhy are you messing with him\u201d and I told them that he did it all and I did everything you said to do, they didn\u2019t answer their phones and I didn\u2019t know what to do, and my mom switched it all onto me saying I need to be punished even though I did everything she said! My brother put his hands on me and called me foul things and I was trying to get away and I\u2019m the one at fault because \u201cI should have stayed in my room.\u201d\n\nNow something that just happened, I am doing Michigan HOSA, and if you don\u2019t know what it is, it\u2019s basically a medical competition, and I need 55 dollars for the fee. I had 200 for my homecoming dress, tickets and HOSA. My dress came to 120 so I had enough for tickets and HOSA, but my mother took it. I called her a bit ago and told her I need the money or I can\u2019t do the competition and she laughed and said \u201cYour dad and I used it, what do you want me to do?\u201d I\u2019ve been talking about this for weeks because I\u2019m so excited and I\u2019ve been reminding them over and over (Which I get screamed at for but they tell me to remind them because \u201cthey\u2019ll forget\u201d) and they spent my money. It was literally mine! And she laughed. I can\u2019t win. These aren\u2019t even serious things, they sound so petty, but there is so much more.\n\nMy mother has dragged me to school after I tried to commit suicide because she caused a nervous breakdown by telling me about money problems and how selfish I was. She acted ghetto and yelled at all the staff, even though we were at home and it had nothing to do with the school, she just wanted the attention, so she dragged me to the school. The school called an ambulance and I was escorted to the hospital on suicide watch and the way there, she was behind the ambulance in her car, driving and crying. At the hospital, the whole time she was telling me it was my fault and she didn\u2019t do anything.\n\nShe did again but this time with my dad. She kept saying how out of control I was and I started hyperventilating, they both were screaming at me and my mom said to take me to a psychiatric hospital and my dad grabbed me by me arms and shook me trying to get me to go, while I was crying and hyperventilating.\n\nI also read my parents texts and my mother is constantly bad mouthing me and saying I\u2019m out of control and nothing would even happen. I\u2019d be in my room with my boyfriend laughing and she\u2019d text my father how I hurt her feelings or said something to her. my mom stirs up drama so she can come in my room and apologize and then relate it back to her childhood\n\nI just constantly want to die because no matter what I do I\u2019m in the wrong, nothing I do is good enough and I get screamed at or threatened left and right, but they\u2019re constantly telling me I\u2019m over reacting and being a baby, am I?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I really wish that I could talk to him, but I realized that I wouldn't even know what to say, other than to just retell my own story to him and have him perhaps see parallels. Of course, for me, I would likely have written off the parallels as some sort of coincidence and rationalized her behavior, which just makes it more difficult for me to formulate an answer.\n\nWhat helped you all understand it and leave in your circumstances?

He told me he didn\u2019t want to be friends with me anymore, that our friendship was just a phase.", "author": "FifiTipsybelle", "self_text": "\nYesterday we went to a party, it was a huge event in another city, with his group of friends that always were so kind to me and considered me part of their gang.\nWe used to date, then he decided he wanted just to be friends with me and I was okay with that and kept talking and hanging out on a daily basis for 2 years. He was part of my life, he made me part of his. He was the light of my eyes. Two months ago he was extremely rude to me one night at dinner, he was yawning, he was just bringing down everything I said, and made me feel like shit while I was trying just to have a nice moment and smiling, bringing up conversation and decided he didn\u2019t want to be there anymore, asked for the check while I was still in the middle of my meal and left me. We didn\u2019t spoke since and yesterday we saw each other on the party, I was cordial, I was nervous but I went there too to fix things with this guy. Of course I needed time, he left me crying, he made me feel terrible but still he was my friend I thought it was worthy to give it a try. \nLong story short, we were on the same table, we didn\u2019t talk at all. I asked him to join me on an activity that we enjoyed that was happening at the party and denied, so I stopped asking, just to find out as soon as I get from the activity that he left the party, his best friends wedding, \u201cbecause I was there\u201d \u201cbecause I kept pushing him on dancing\u201d \u201cbecause I was too uncomfortable and rude to him\u201d. I was shocked, I was crushed, that wasn\u2019t true. I called him so he didn\u2019t miss his friends party, he blocked me. All of his friends were like \u201cgirl he will never change, he is like that, he is weird, let him go and move on\u201d\nWe stepped Into each other at the hotel and i asked him what happened. He was like \u201cleave me alone, you ruined my life, you ruined my day, I don\u2019t like you, I don\u2019t love you, I need you to GTFO, you and your stupid feelings and drama. I don\u2019t want to be friends with you anymore, we cannot be friends, it was just a phase, I will always be grateful because you saved me, you help me through the darkest times of my life but we are done, someday you will find someone else that deserves you but get the hell out of my face\u201d\nHe was mad, he was yelling and I was shocked and apparently he was offended by me the day of the awful dinner because I told him if he wasn\u2019t comfortable I could stay and finish my dinner so he could leave (he paid the check and he was already standing up grabbing his jacket, but then he was like \u201coh, you\u2019re still eating, well, I\u2019ll wait \ud83d\ude44\u201d ) I didn\u2019t use a rude tone, I smiled with tears in my eyes and he left. He was mad at me too and I didn\u2019t know until yesterday but it was too late. I said he misinterpreted me and that we could fix it but he refused, that our friendship was done. \nI asked him if it was his final decision and he said yes. I wished him best, I thanked for all, I told him we could work things out, that he was my best friend and that I couldn\u2019t believe it was the last time I would see him and talk to him, but i had to respect his decision. We hugged goodbye and suddenly he pushed me and said \u201cget the fuck out and leave me alone, I don\u2019t wanna get rude, so GTFO\u201d\nI left, I have been crying all day, feeling like crap. Of course I won\u2019t reach him nor getting his attention in any way, I left the hotel and said goodbye to all his friends, because i no longer belong there and I won\u2019t be that person who keeps pushing away his friend of the happy moments. Now I\u2019m on a bus looking for some Reddit answers. Does it get better? WTF Happened? I feel ashamed, stupid and hurt. I will let him go but it hurts like hell.

He would ignore me on purpose during my panic attacks and hang up the phone if I started crying.

I asked him for a divorce and even though he's prideful he's also too cheap to spend a lot of money on a lawyer so he's agreed to split the money, house 50/50 and we each keep our own material property (furniture, clothes, crap that doesn't matter etc.). His work schedule is all over the place since he travels a lot so he says he won't fight me for physical custody but he wants to have split legal custody. In the state we live from what I've read they try to give equal rights to both parents so most likely unless I unmask everything I've kept as evidence and spend a lot of money in a court battle he will get split legal custody but our baby will live with me. Has anyone   gone through a divorce with a child involved? How is parenting with a Nex? Should I use everything and go for sole custody or allow him to be a part of our baby's life if he makes the effort? I'm so torn that it's making me feel sick to my stomach and I am losing sleep over this. I will be speaking to a lawyer soon but wanted to see if anyone has gone through something similar. \n\nI thought about giving the backstory but it's so long. I could literally write a book about everything he's said or done and how manipulative he is and how amazing he is at getting me to fall again and make excuses for his actions etc. but it's just so exhausting to think about it all. Sadly we've only been married for 2 years (together for 5). 2 years of marriage and I can't take it anymore. Had it not been for our baby I probably would have stayed longer and continue doubting myself and tolerated his behavior and verbal bashing for many years to come but I look at my sweet little baby and I know I don't want to raise him in this toxic relationship and environment. And there is no way in hell I will let my husband turn this little angel into another extension of himself. It's NOT okay and I will NOT watch my child treat someone else's child this way in the future, not ever! I will die a thousand times over before I let this happen. \n\nAnyway I think I have enough in hand to have a winning case if I try for sole custody but not sure if removing him completely from our child's life is the best thing either. He does seem to genuinely have affection for our baby, at least it seems like it when he does make time for him but he's done almost next to nothing as far as helping me with him. By that I mean I'm the one taking care of him almost always. I work full time now (went back 5 months ago post having the baby) and after I get off work I devote all my time to our baby. When baby is sick I'm the one taking a day off or working from home so I can make sure I still make money. I'm the breadwinner so a lot depends on me financially. I'm the one doing all the grocery shopping, taking and picking up the baby from the nanny's, making sure he has food, waking up at random hours of the night bc this kid is such a light sleeper like me so he wakes up a lot. On top of doing all this I get scolded for being an awful wife, that I don't listen and heaven forbid I ever take a break or forget to wash the dishes one day bc if he happens to come home and sees the dishes in the sink I'll never hear the end of it. He also chooses not to come home and spend time with our child whenever he pleases. In fact one of the times he was going to not come home I found out he was going to go cheat on us. I say us because it's not just me, he is also taking that precious time away from our baby so that he can indulge in sexual relationships outside of our marriage. The cheating though that wasn't what angered me, from what I found out he had been with that women before. The last time he was going to fly out to see her, his plans got disrupted and he wasn't able to go. He doesn't even know I know but what made me say enough is enough is all the other stuff, the verbal abuse, the belittling, feeling like I'm walking on eggshells all the time, trying to always think ahead on ways to do things so that I don't anger him, his priorities or lack of, he prioritizes shacking up with someone else over spending time with his baby. But the biggest reason is being scared that our baby will grow up to be just like him. He is gone around 75% of each month traveling so you'd think he'd be rushing home to see his baby to watch our baby grow and hit all the little milestones but no that's definitely not the case. You know what though, when he isn't home it's peaceful, I feel like I can breathe and be in my own skin. That's sad right? Who would of thought that my marriage would crumble and be hell on earth and constant turmoil... I know these next 6+ months are going to be tough but this is my biggest blocker as it will impact my baby so much. Ughh what to do :(.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

They usually grow up with parents who are takers, so they learned from young age that giving is loving. They don't usually count the return, if they consider somebody as \"friend\", they give to make harmony. They avoid anger and solve conflict to maintain the harmony. They are proud of the harmony, and take it as the reward of their giving attitude.\n\nWhy? Because in their subconscious, their kindness is appreciated by others who receive it. So they are not angry, they are patient, thinking they will get the karmas by being kind.\n\nHowever, it's far from the truth. TAKERS DON'T APPRECIATE!\n\nIt's the most painful truth I've discovered in my whole life. My mother never cared. My exN never cared. They take the kindness as granted. They blame when I burnout. They don't remember the goodness only my weakness. They don't even have objective consistency, they take then literally forget, like I'm a vending machine and only deserve to offer whatever they want.\n\nThen the anger strike me. How is that fair? Do you have even morals? Do you have no shame? And the \"innocence\" in their eyes triggered me more. They don't even recognize kindness, everything they see are blames, the mirror of themselves.\n\nThen I start to see I don't deserve the blames, I deserve to be treated equally. I started to get in touch with anger, to fight back, to rip their heads off. That's how I got out of the FOG and to the road of freedom.\n\nGuys, see through their bullshit. The beautiful words they put, they are empty. The kindness they offer, all in the beginning to lure you in. They despise you, think you are stupid for giving that much, then they blame you for not giving that much. They literally call you \"stupid and innocent\" to your face, and so proud of their \"smartness\". They think they are winners by being \"that smart\". They don't appreciate, never did, you are merely a slave, an object, a tool.\n\nThe good thing is, you are stronger than them. They are cowards, without taking they are nothing. Once I get in touch of my anger and no longer give, they are merely parasites who lose their hosts, nothing, losers. The karma eventually hits, not the way I used to believe, but it brings justice.\n\nStay strong! You will find the anger eventually, and let it bring power, justice and fire.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* I apology for using the term \"pwPDs\" instead of \"cluster Bs\".

I am a 27 (f) who actually got introduced to this group by the narcissistic female. I wasnt really aware of narcissism but this girl embodies everything wrong with society today and more. She was nice to me at first because I was seeing an f boy friend she knew. I actually reached out to her via a fb make up group a long time ago because he kept liking her photos. Naturally I creeped but she had lots of mutual frienda in the scene I was in a couple years back. \n\nI was going to an event and she was there so she introduced me to the group. They were all really nice. I made friends with everyone instantly.\n\nThe 2nd event, the group of friends asked if I wanted to go and she was going too. As soon as we get to this event which is supposed to be a fun time for everyone... she gets pulled aside by her ex boyfriend who was also there and reamed out for a good half hour because she posted a youtube video of a story about them hooking up and him shitting on the floor. She was crying during this confrontation and her friend told me they told her not to post it but she didnt listen.\n\nAs time passed I noticed a person in the group who was about to leave for BC pulled her best friend aside while she wasnt around and told her friend... I dont like her.. I dont like her style.. shes too much drama. Trust me.. my ears perked up then.\n\nThere was another event. She texted me asking if I was going with the group and I said ya you are welcome to come. She texted back with : I know. Theyre MY friends.\n\nShe used to talk a lot of shit about a guy I was friends with, who was unfortunately murdered 2 yrs ago. She had a huge rant in my car about how she hated him so much. When he was murdered, there was an event held for him against gun violence, and she was there comforting someone in  the group and even presented an art piece of him to be sold off in auction... yet she hated him. If you talk to her now though.. she will change the narrative to... \"we were friends\".\n\nI was at a party her friend hosted. I was upset about the recent passing of my murderes friend so I said I wanted to talk about it with her and a couple people there and she laughed at me in front of everyone and said... Hahahahaha id rather NOT... and the proceeded with WHY ARE YOU PSYCHO? ... as she knew everyone would hear it and not say anything to her. I didnt have the balls to start a conflict with her there.\n\nI unfortunately was her ride home. On the ride home she started talking about her breaking up with her ex boyfriend because \" I have too many options\".... she takes photos on instagram on the daily and so I figured finally... this girl is full of shit.\n\nWhen I got home.. I logged onto my facebook to find myself tagged on my friends obituary page. Post from this girl.... she said \" ____ and I had a heart to heart\u2764\u2764. That's when I knew.. this girl is fake as hell. She just laughed at me and called me psycho and then goes to try and get attention from the community about his recent passing about how in tune she supposedly is. After she did all this on this night.. I knew I had to watch my back with her.\n\nI posted a status a couple weeks later and she posted on it starting problems like she usually does \"all you do is post about boys\". So now was my chance. I decided to confront her. It went down something like this:\n\nMe: hey are we going to have a problem or something here?\nHer: i dont understand how what I said was problematic\nMe: ok because not only do you make comments on that but you also go out of your way to say certain shit thats off side to me all the time.\nHer: i hate how you pretend you want some good life\nMe: how does one \"pretend\" to want a good life?\nHer: I dont know. The group doesnt like you though.\nMe: ok well nobody has made me aware of this.. what makes you say that?\nHer: if you want respect act respectable?\nMe: How do I act respectable to your standard so that you approve of me? ( i said this as a jab because she was trying to exert control)\nHer: I dont know, I am indifferent, I am apathetic.\n\nThen she gave me this lecture that this is who she is. Blocked me after saying Hahahahahaha Then slandered me to the whole group including the f boy we were mutually friends with.\n\nI was so confused on what just happened. Like part of me felt like she said shit like this because she is inferior and doesnt have her life together...while I do and I am on the right track. She was un necessarily mean about it and then made sure to slander me so I would become alienated from the group.\n\nI got some screen shots awhile ago since breaking up with the friends group because of her. These screen shots were from someone in that group about her getting told off via email and she posted them online for everyone to see. I heard she thinks I sent the email to her but I cant be bothered being back in her trap of lies and attention seeking bullshit. My name is being dragged by her right now and im not doing anything about it because she is the most toxic person I have ever met in my life.\n\nShe thinks its me probably because I have openly told people in the past im not a fan of hers anymore... but apparently she never shuts up about it and goes on like an obsessive lunatic about these emails.\n\nShe is obsessed with her social media image, doesnt have a career, has been trying to get famous for the last decade. Shes obnoxious and loud in a room. Its like she has no emotional intelligence. People openly tell her best friend they dont like her. He always invites her anyways.

At the time he was 16 when he visited and still condoning my behavior towards him (already a red flag.) It all started out fine wed go on walks or go out to dinner with my mother (she had suspected we liked each other but hand't said anything about it.) But the day before he left he came over to my house during the night. He had already visited before so this wasn't new. We played games on my PS4 and hung out. But then fully without my consent or anything he set his hand on my thigh while I was playing the game. He squeezed and after a bit removed his hand. Obviously since I'm 12 I wasn't ready and I had no idea what to do after that. I've got generalized anxiety disorder so I was already freaking out inside. So I never told him to stop cause I was just so scared of the situation. After he put his hand on my crotch my chest and my thigh again multiple times. After a bit I stood up and went to sit down at my computer to try to calm down. He left after and I acted like everything was fine. And I honestly believed it for awhile. I was so completely manipulated by this guy that I believed it was my fault for not telling him to stop and that it was natural.

The abusers throw them like throwing knifes into your heart. However as my healing journey progressed, I find myself less hurt by the verbal abuse, more angry about how nasty this person is. I'm not sure if my technique helps but I want to share it, probably it will make you less hurt by name callings. (excuse me if I've written it before)\n\nUsually the healing is done after the discard/leaving, but when trapped in it, it requires mental strength to stand up. The healing has two components: 1) find out the abuser's motivation; 2) look into your own insecurities;\n\nThe abuser's motivation is always 1) try to trap you; 2) try to use you to regulate emotion; either one. Does he/she try to make you feel bad of leaving or go to see a friend? Does he/she try to make you feel bad of standing up to yourself so he/she has to take the blame? Is he/she jealous of some good qualities of you and try to sabotage it? The abuse is NEVER about you, it's always about them, their insecurities of 1) can't be alone; 2) has to be perfect and above all; Once one see that the abuse is an projection, he/she will start to see what the inner world the abuser has, and slowly be less influenced by the manipulation.\n\nThe other thing is your own insecurities. As a caretaker in abusive relationship, one usually is a perfectionist, who has WAY MORE insecurities than he/she should have. So if one is feeling really bad about particular abuse, he/she must have some false believes, usually negative to him/herself. IT'S NOT TRUE! Think reversely, and try to picture if the reverse reality is true, why you think it's not? Try to picture if your friend is in your situation, will you judge him/her the way you judge yourself? Slowly by removing insecurities, one will be more confident, less influenced by judgements,  carry less shame, and be emotionally stronger.\n\nIt's gonna be hard.

Sometimes they are tyrants (fear), sometimes they are \"givers\" (obligation), sometimes they are victims (guilt). I will try to share my experience of how to maintain a firm boundary with guilt, not sure if it helps but I hope so!\n\nWhy and what situation do cluster Bs bring guilt? Usually when you are so firm about something and stand up for yourself. It not gonna work with a tantrum (make you more angry), not gonna work with past \"givings\" (you laid it out in front of them), then they start to be quiet and passive, or sobbing and shaky, like a hurt animal, when hostile and defensive reactions are expected (you called their names!). It brings a lot of self-doubt and guilt in decent people's mind, \"did I hurt them?\" \"did I do it wrong?\" \"if they are truly bad why didn't they defend?\"\n\nBut remember, every move cluster Bs do have a purpose. What's the purpose here? To trap you, or to use you to regulate their emotions? It's either one or BOTH. How did it trap you? You start to abandon the original plan of confronting them and pushing through a decision. Instead of execute the decision, you spend your time being GUILTY and SELF-DOUBT, thinking about WHY. How did it regulate their emotions? You start to think \"Maybe they are not bad at all? Maybe I've push too far and hurt them? Maybe I'm the bad one?\" You literally shift the blame from them (the responsive party) to yourself (the innocent party). By feeling GUILTY, you gaslight yourself to be the abuser and them being the victim (quite the opposite!)\n\nHow you gonna maintain a firm boundary here? After analyzing, you start to see that PLAYING VICTIM is actually evil, and it validates the original believe that they are the abuser, you have to confront and make the decision to leave or build boundary. It removes the guilt and brings back the anger and confidence. Anger is the victim's mental strength, self-assurance is the direction to go, now we have them back and have the force to keep going, or knowing not to react to guilt, to sit with it, and push through the original plan and boundaries.\n\nThrough my journey, I realized that since I am a highly empathetic NT, any move I make can't be evil  from intention. I hope you believe it too, and analyze your abuser's behavior to find their purpose. May the anger and force stay with you to clear the FOG.

I thought I had won the lottery and that now I was going to live my perfect romance story. In reality, he was extremely abusive. He would ignore me for days and days without telling me why he was mad. He would grope me even though I constantly told him he was being too forceful and was hurting me. He would rape me in my sleep, or coerce me into having sex whenever and wherever he wanted and then brag about it. He would smother me with pillows as a \"joke\" and he even sent me two death threats at different points of the relationship. \n\nWhen we broke up, he stopped talking to everyone in our group of childhood friends. He disappeared. I never told anyone because he was his friend too. I didn't want to stir up drama. And he wasn't talking to anyone so what was the harm in not speaking up?\n\nFast forward three years, I found out he's been contacting three of our mutual friends. I've been living the past few months in terror, thinking he might show up in my life again. I decided, with the advice from my psychologist, to finally tell my group of friends about what happened. \nI started by calling my oldest friend. I was terrified because we've been friends since we were 9. I didn't want to lose her if she didn't believe me. Her response was perfect. She told me she was sorry this had happened,  she 100% believed me and she thanked me for being so brave and having enough trust to tell her. She told me she was there for me, for whatever I needed and to just call her about anything. \n\nI'm glad I told her first. I cried happy tears and I'm now feeling more relieved. I still want to tell the rest, but I'm taking my time. I'm a little bit scared of talking to two of them, because they were best friends with my ex for 10 years,  but I'm hoping that they'll be as kind as my other friend.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Before that, I felt like I deserved all the hostility and anger because I was a pretty horrible drunk. He beat me up one night when we were both drunk after sex. I always said I\u2019d call the cops and leave if someone did that to me, but I didn\u2019t. It was a really messed up situation, but I was leaving in a few weeks to finish school across country. I didn\u2019t know what would happen, but obviously we stayed together. He continued to party and lie the whole time I was gone I found out later. He told a lot of people I made it up. It\u2019s funny how I stopped drinking when I got beat up and he continued.\n\nHe\u2019s never hit me or attacked me again, but he yells at me frequently. He has gotten up in my face several times, scaring me. It\u2019s usually over the dumbest stuff. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I can be a sarscastic bitch on occasion, but I\u2019m not a screamer or scene maker. I prefer to walk away, but he sometimes follows me around yelling or picks fights in the car.\n\nLast week, we were going to town to do some shopping, and I was so excited to have a little extra money for some new household items. There were multiple places I wanted to go, and he said he did too the day before. The morning of, I could tell he was tense and angry. As always, he denied it, but I knew it was only a matter of time time. He told me to be ready to go at 9. At 850 he was angry I wasn\u2019t ready to walk out the door, so instead of helping me, he slammed the door and sat in the car. In my haste, I forgot several things. I had made a list of places we neeeded to go. I had dropped my phone in the toilet but he insisted we go and he could find the places we had never been (I was buying something off Facebook marketplace). I knew it was a bad idea when we set out for the house. He said it was a \u201cromantic drive\u201d. Five minutes later, were pulled over on the side of the road while he screams at me wasting his time and being irresponsible. He\u2019s accused me multiple times of dropping my phone on purpose. He took off driving and screaming like a maniac, and I finally started screaming myself. I\u2019d never yelled at anyone like that, and I hated it. He made me feel like a caged animal. Then he was like \u201cwow, you need help.\u201d\n\nThere were some other minor incidents this week, but tonight blew up badly. We went on an evening walk, and he was not being very responsive. He rarely seems interested in what I have to say, but he was being kinda short. We came to a street so we could go straight into the crosswalk or take a left and continue down a sidewalk. There was an suv pulled all the way into the crosswalk trying to turn. He said \u201cwhich way do you want to go?\u201d I said \u201cstraight\u201d. He said \u201cwhich way?\u201d I said \u201c straight.\u201d He sneered \u201cwow. I asked twice. You can\u2019t walk through a vehicle, so which is it in front of the suv or behind?\u201d He was so snotty and condescending, so I just said \u201clet\u2019s just go home.\u201d He tried to argue but I said it again. He was quiet for a few minutes, but then he began raging about how I\u2019m such a mean, awful person on my new meds. He was full on screaming and cursing at me for 3 blocks. I repeatedly asked hem to stop yelling. He said I\u2019m a child because I wanted to come home instead of dealing with problems. It was so awful and humiliating. He also mocked me for current health problems. I tried to tell him he was being mean and abusive, but he said that I was the abusive one because I probably wouldn\u2019t talk to him tomorrow after this. Is if abusive to give someone \u201cthe silent treatment\u201d after they\u2019ve berated you and called you names? I always forgive him when he apologizes, and that\u2019s part of the problem. I have called him a dick when he\u2019s done mean things, but I wouldn\u2019t call myself abusive. Am I experiencing gaslighting?\n\nThese are just two of the bigger fights from the last 10 days. Yes, I know I need to get out. I\u2019ve allowed myself, with his help, to get into debt. I\u2019m having health issues and am supposed to have major surgery soon. There are more barriers, but I won\u2019t list them all.\n\nTL;DR My much older boyfriend is always angry.

Im currently in a 8 yr relationship with a man I love with all of my being, but he is destroying me ad our relationship and doesn't seem to give a shit most of the time. I was a single mom of 2 boys whe we met and he was 6 yrs younger than me. He is also extremely attractive ad it is by far the best sex I have ever had. Even in the beginning he would do all kinds of things that were red flags i should have listened to but ignored. He would purposely flirt with other women to make me jealous and any mistake i have ever made in my life he throws in my face like im the biggest fuck up in the world. but still we had such an amazing connection i just ignored all the other things. Fast forward to 5 yrs ago i got pregnant with his child my 3rd. I was sick the entire time so could not work like i had previously with the other 2. As soon as i had our daughter we decided i should stay home with her for awhile. Well during this time he offered no help with the baby bc he was working. He goes to work for a few hours bc hes self employed and comes home and does nothing else but play video games for hours i mean like 12 hours. Always telling me i'm worthless mom that does nothing bc i dont work he would say a lot more too on top of treating my boys like shit. Well for the last few years i've been working bc i couldn't stand to hear it anymore about i do nothing. Well guess what now i don't make enough money bc i'm just a pathetic worthless mom that is to scared to ask for a raise. Now I also do all the housework too like everything he does absolutely nothing but make a mess that i always have to clean. He calls me a bitch multiple times a day in front of our daughter along with all the other abusive names. Its always about him. He actually told me the other day when i met u i thought u would give me the world but you do nothing for me. Now he refuses to help me out at all besides the bills. I do get EBT and medicaid for my kids but he says i don't contribute anything i'm nothing but a pathetic excuse for a mom. About 3 yrs ago i started using heroin. Terrible i know i had previously had a problem with pain pills that just wet out of control and i no its my fault but i felt like i had to use something just to deal with him everyday. I got help a few months ago at first when i finally talked to him about it he seemed supportive but now all he does is throw it i my face! I m trying so hard to keep clean but everyday he calls me fucking pathetic drug addict tells me to go shoot up threatens to take my daughter. he treats my boys terrible they are now 13 and 16. i have no money ad no way to leave i don't know what to do. Any one got any advice/ Most days i literally just want to kill myself but i cant be that selfish bc i have 3 kids that need me but i'm just so depressed i can barely function.

I\u2019m been I\u2019m a good relationship now for the past 9 or so months but I think that remembering this experience has put a strain on my relationship. When I first remembered I didn\u2019t tell my boyfriend but I became really avoidant about intimacy and he noticed. One night I broke down and told him everything. Since then we have maybe only had sex once. I used to feel very happy to dress up cute for him and be intimate together but now anything like that makes me get really upset and distressed even if I feel fine otherwise. I guess my feelings are pretty strong.\n\nWe keep having the same conversation about it over and over again and it just leaves me so upset. I understand that he is frustrated by it, I am too, but I keep explaining to him that I'm working on this with my therapist and it isn't something that will be resolved overnight.

I don't know how to reach any sort of middle ground on this and I think he imagines that I'll be able to just go back to how I was before, not understanding that the before this wasn't good either. It was just harder for him to tell.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how we can compromise on this and also how I can resolve this issue within myself?

Each breakup, each time I sobbed for hours, each time I was abandoned and left alone, I was slowly trained to be somewhat okay with her not being in my life. That\u2019s what\u2019s stupid about narcissists, they think they have all this control and that their games are all in their favor. What they fail to realize is that their games and abuse eventually wean you off of them. This breakup woke me up, it made me realize, hey...

For some background information I\u2019m a 22 year old female. My friend who he said was grooming me is a female too. She\u2019s 29. She does exhibit some strange behavior. I feel she finds excuses to touch me because when she\u2019s looking for something in the car she\u2019ll just put her hand under my butt in the process and say she\u2019s not trying to grope me. One time she did while I was changing too but that time it was super light. She also just starts changing in front of me at Publix places and everything. We go on road trips a lot and she\u2019ll be all like \u201cokay my boobs will be out\u201d. This happens at gas stations so if she needs to change she can just go inside but whatever. Anyway, she\u2019ll just start changing in front of me a lot but a lot of times guys are around so maybe it\u2019s for them. Another time we were over her bfs house and she told him to just change in the bathroom and that we\u2019ll change in the bedroom. While camping she\u2019ll say it\u2019s cold and that she needs body heat so come all close. She seems to want me in the same bed as her a lot even when she\u2019s with guys. I feel she stopped because most of the guys end up being weird or maybe it\u2019s because she actually likes the guy who she\u2019s with now.

Anyway, she has looked out for me in the past so I was surprised she didn\u2019t tell me. I imagine it was because maybe he drugged her too so her memory really was that foggy or if she was saying stuff maybe she feels to blame bc it turned him on and didn\u2019t wanna tell me that part.

I don't really know whether to call it neglect or abuse, or if there is really much of a difference. (My mom didn't really hit me, aside from normal spankings when I was a kid.)\n\nSo I have an older sister and a younger half brother. When my parents were married, we didn't have a lot of money but we managed and weren't completely broke, but my sister I got used to not getting stuff. But my parents divorced when I was 7 and my mom, sister and I moved in with a guy, who would later be my step dad, when I was 8. By the time I was 10, my half brother was born and my sister moved in with my dad. My mom hated her for that and shit talked her a lot. \n\nAs my brother got older, he became the favorite kid. I'm not saying this just because he is the youngest. My mom and stepdad started making more money and my mom wanted to be viewed as socialite with her new family. My sister and I didn't count anymore, even though I still lived with my mom. My mom stopped taking me to any social gatherings, stopped taking me on family vacations and started only focusing on my brother. \n\nAt some point, she stopped taking care of me in general. She only spent my dad's child support on me but most of that still went to my brother too. Everything was from him. She stopped including me for dinners, cooking only for her, my stepdad and my brother. Stopped buying groceries for me at all. I constantly had to get pads from my friend at school. She paid for me to have a phone and that was all (still more than some people, I understand)\n\nShe got to the point where I had an allergic reaction to Zoloft (the only reason I got to a doctor for that was because the school councilor got involved, my mom was worried about her social image) But my tongue was swollen and I was trying hard to breathe, she wouldn't take me to an ER. I messaged my friend, scared and they tried to drive me to the ER (leaving their own birthday to do so) but I was scared of what my mom would do and made them drop it. \n\nI have a lot more I could list but I went to college and told a free school therapist about all this and he was baffled and happy for me to be living on campus, a state away from her. But I had problems with that college and had to move home after a semester. I started repressing and dealing with everything my mom did again. It all got even worse since I was an adult but I managed to make her give me my dad's child support so I could pay my own phone bill and buy my food. \n\nNow I'm almost 20 and finally managed to leave her mental abuse and neglect. I live with my dad now and I couldn't be happier. I don't hide in my room here. My dad and I go out to eat almost every night. He didn't know the neglect happening because I didn't tell him but I can tell he is starting to find out by how surprised I am being allowed to pick out groceries. I can work if I want but he would rather me be happy and relax now, so I'm being a little selfish and doing that before going back to college. He bought me a phone and pays my phone bill. I said hermit crabs would be cool to have so he bought me two crabs and all the stuff they needed. I wanted to see It: Chapter two so he took me. He won't let me pay for anything, even though I grab stuff only because I thought I was buying it. I made extra money babysitting and was excited to buy borderlands 3 when it came out, he came home with the deluxe edition for me the day it released. I know it sounds like my dad is just throwing money and gifts at me, but most of it is just small stuff and to someone who has been neglected for so long, it means the world. \n\nI left out a lot of my mom's manipulation, how my brother treats everyone horrible (he is only 9) and other things, even now she didn't bother to tell me about my grandpa's birthday in Tennessee but told my sister (just to clarify, I love my sister and we see each other a lot). I resent my mother more and more as I don't have to find a way to cope and deal with her. I might honestly be able to say, I don't care about her or my brother, I only miss my dog and cat at her house.\n\nFinally, I've been living with my dad over a month and I couldn't be more grateful. He is the parent everyone deserves to have and I wish I could give him the world (though he'd probably just rather more racecars)", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I will be describing/venting about past physical abuse I lived with but was not necessarily directly subject to. The last thing I want to do is intrude in a space I do not belong in, so please do not hesitate to tell me if I am out of line here.\n\nSecond, this is my first Reddit post ever and I'm posting on my phone so, again, apologies.\n\nThirdly, I tend to be long-winded (clearly), so this will probably be pretty long.\n\nYesterday, seemingly out of nowhere, I remembered one of the worst days of my life. Or one of the worst moments, I guess. Back when I was living with my mom and her husband and my two brothers, when I was still in high school, there were multiple instances where my stepdad would lash out violently. Sometimes, he would just get so angry. He's diagnosed bipolar, which is a partial explanation but certainly not an excuse by any means.\n\nHe never hit me, but he did everything else that he could to make me feel unsafe and unwelcome in that house. He would break down my door, threaten to kick me out, scream at me and get in my face when he felt I was being \"disrespectful\".\n\nI don't know if he's ever hit my mom, but I wouldn't be surprised if he has. I've seen marks on her arms before, but she's never told me where they came from and she's acted very defensive about them. That speaks volumes to me.\n\nBut my older brother... especially during the final year that I lived in that house, my older brother dealt with significant physical abuse from my stepdad. It didn't happen everyday. We never knew when it would happen. My stepdad would just snap.\n\nSomething that you have to understand about my older brother, and my younger one as well, is that they are significantly mentally stunted. They're not stupid by any means. But through a combination of developmental disorders/conditions, they are effectively children. And even now, as adults above the age of 18, they are under legal guardianship of my mother because they've been deemed incompetent. So, they're harmless, from my perspective. To beat them is like beating a child.\n\nI wasn't there for a lot of the incidents. But I was there for this one and it haunts me to this day.\n\nBasically, one afternoon, my stepdad stormed into my brother's room and started beating him savagely with a belt.\n\nMy stepdad called it discipline, punishment because my brother hadn't mowed the grass like he had been told to. But that wasn't discipline. It was straight up abuse. Physical assault. Not to mention, he had absolutely no legal right to physically discipline my brother because he is not his legal or blood guardian. He's just some guy my mom married. And furthermore, my brother was over the age of 18 at that point. He was under my mom's guardianship, but he was a fucking ADULT.\n\nAnd I don't care what excuse or reasoning you give, beating someone or \"spanking\" them is absolutely unacceptable. I don't care who they are, what they did, how mad you are, how old they are. I don't fucking care. It's abuse and it makes me sick that some people justify it.\n\nI didn't see much, but I heard everything from my room. My stepdad's furious booming voice telling my brother to bend over and take it and to stop fighting back (he was DEFENDING HIMSELF), the collision of leather on skin, my mom trying to calm my stepdad down and doing nothing to actually protect her son, my brother's screams. That's the worst part. I can still hear his screams in my head. That's what plays on a loop in my mind. That's what I hear right now.\n\nI was pretty much paralyzed with fear. Looking back, I wish I would have jumped in the way, shielded my brother with my own body. Been the hero he needed since my mother had failed him so spectacularly by marrying this asshole and allowing this to go on for so long. But I didn't. I don't think I left my room at all. I was too scared. I called my dad, who lived out of state 3 and a half hours away. I didn't know what else to do. And my poor dad, being so far away, what else was he supposed to do? He called the police.\n\nAn officer came by. Things had calmed down by then. My stepdad was able to put on a civil face. I think the officer talked to my brother, but clearly the act was solid because nothing was done. The police left and my step dad immediately turned to me and told me to pack my shit and get out. Because he thought that I had called the police. And that in doing so, I was disrespecting him and undermining his authority in his house.\n\nAgain I was paralyzed. I was I think...17 at that point? Pretty sure I was still a minor. Still a kid. Still in school. And now apparently I was being kicked out and told to fend for myself because I had dared to try to protect my brother. And I hadn't even been the one to call the police! I wish I had. Maybe I could have given them more details. Maybe something would have actually been done. But no.\n\nMy mom talked my step dad down and I was allowed to stay. Lucky me.\n\nI got out soon after. I finally left and spent the next year living at a nearby relative's place while I finished school. My relationship with my mom has steadily declined since back then. Her many flaws that lead to such abusive situations have become more apparent to me with time and distance.\n\nHere's the kicker though. My brothers are still living with my mom and stepdad. My older brother has been presented with several opportunities to get out and come live with my dad and have a chance at an actual safe and meaningful life. But he's gone crawling back to my mom every time. And it drives me insane. Is he that brainwashed? He actively chooses to stay with someone who has abused him in the past and shown little remorse for it. And who knows, he might still be abusing him. I have no fucking idea. But it really. Really. Bothers me.\n\nI understand it's hard to get out of an abusive situation. And my brother's perception of things is easily influenced and manipulated. I don't blame him. But I'm still upset, I'm still angry. To an extent, I just don't understand how you could stay in a house with someone who has literally beaten you. I don't want to sound like I'm victim blaming. I've never been hit or physically abused, so what the fuck do I know? But I'm just so. Frustrated.\n\nI want him and my younger brother out. I want them safe. I want them happy and growing and learning and being as independent as they possibly can be. And they'll never have any of that living there.\n\nIf you've read this far, you're a saint. This is all in the past...it happened over 5 years ago. But every now and again, it just pops back in my head. The sounds of my brother's screams.

So I begin driving to the fair for the 2nd time. As we get closer he starts bitching about not wanting to pay for parking and that we need to just park on the street and walk. Okay, so we did that. (Mind you, he brought his metal detector and I have a few items in my car of value), so I'm in fear of someone breaking into my car. It's not a great side of town. Anyways, he calls me over dramatic again and gets me to give it up, so we begin our 1/2 mile trek to the fair. We get to the ticket booth and he goes up to the lady in the booth and asks her, \"Um, so it is admission free today? Or has it EVER been free on the first day?\" She begins to say no it isn't,  but that it used to be. He whips his head around and says to me, \"SEE?!\" And then walks right out of the line in front of a crowd of people. I was so embarrassed, so I just started to head straight for my car. I finally got to my car and got in, then he shows up 5 minutes later. And now he is pissed that I walked away and told me that if I want to park in a safe spot, I have to pay for it. (I don have any money because he didnt let me go to the ATM beforehand, telling me that I could borrow $20). Parking is $10 so I bite the bullet and park, because fixing my potentially broken window and replacing his metal detector would cost waaaaay more than paying for parking. He ends up paying for our admission, which was $24 all together. \nNight goes on, I'm hungry but he doesnt want to buy me food because it's not healthy and too expensive. I really liked this ring but its was out of my $10 budget so I knew it was out of the question. We come across a silver and gold trading company booth and he goes ahead and purchases $117 worth of silver coins. Doesnt bat and eye about it. \nThen I asked him if I could just owe him $10 instead of $20 because we both used gas to get to the fair and back,  (including the drive back and forth from him telling me to take him back home).\nHe said absolutely not. \nWhat I'm getting at is; in the 2 years that we have been together he has not taken me on more than 3 dates. Hasn't bought me a birthday gift besides the occasional organic chocolate bar or card. I drive him around and asking him to help with gas money is like pulling teeth. He is 42 and I am 25. He has money, but acts like he doesn't. \n\nAnyways, so it is reasonable that he is like this with money? Or am I just not worth any of his?\nAlso, I am in recovery. I go to aloooot of meetings to make sure that I am on top of my emotions so that I dont drink or use. Whenever he begins to argue with me, and if I argue back in the slightest bit, he begins to tell me that I'm crazy and that I have mental health issues. That I am the crazy one because he has NEVER had to do the group therapy that I have to do. I believe that this is gaslighting. Normally I have removed myself somewhat emotionally by listening to meditation when I am upset with him and trying to forgive him because maybe he truly doesnt understand how mean he is? But the last week has been really hard again. I notice that when I start becoming too attached and wanting more emotional support from him is when our arguements start to flare up. It comes in waves. I feel crazy, like I am the problem. But i know that the way he treats me isn't right. It's like I am constantly second guessing my feelings. Oh and another thing is when we argue, he always says, \"Well then we sont need to be together, we arent hanging out anymore!\" So I  always feel like I have to be extra careful when bringing up any issues because he will breakup with me.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

When we were friends he told me that he had 2 exes, one that only lasted like 2 months and a more serious one. He told me that they had a sexual relationship but didn't have penetrative sex he told me in fact that he only touched her but she didn't touch him. There were a lot of inconsistencies with this since he first started saying that they didn't go below the belt but then he escalated the situation any time he brought it up. I later found out that he completely made up this ex when I msged her after the discard and she told me she only knew him because of a class together. A friend of his msged me, she's 15, he's 22. She told me that he told her that he had 69'ed with both of them. These are obviously all lies but I just I don't understand how someone this age thinks it's appropriate to talk to a 15 year old about his sex life? It didn't even happen this year he's been friends with her since she was 12. I always thought this was so creepy because I couldn't imagine being friends with a teenager but I always tried to hope that he was more of a big brother to them but oh no he goes and tells them about his \"sex life\".

I\u2019ll call this one A. \n- I got hired in 2018 by a severe nBoss who made(makes) my life a living hell. \n- In late 2018 (after breakup), I had to leave yet another close friend behind because his behavior was getting more and more erratic/dangerous/threatening/violent (he is very likely diagnosable with BPD) and he was doing things like keeping tabs on me for A, and texted my ex months after I had been NC to triangulate. \n\nWhen I left my ex (LDR- together 8 years) in 2018, I realized that I really had nobody to turn to or fall back on. \n- My mom is emotionally supportive but drunk most of the time, so she often flies into rage and tirades about how ex and his family are worth nothing, failures, how his new gf is stupid and ugly etc. (These are all untrue and unhelpful.) \n- My dad can\u2019t listen to anything that isn\u2019t directly related to himself. \n- My siblings and I are close, but they are rather emotionally repressed because, after all, they are also my parents\u2019 children. \n- \u2018A\u2019 ran a smear campaign and turned many of my oldest friends against me... and my newest friends were so new that we hadn\u2019t really established the sort of rapport that allows you to ask for support from abuse. \n- The two remaining close/old friends I had left were stuck\u2014 one was ex\u2019s best friend and the other was \u2018A\u2019s sister.

He has kids from previous relationship and I have 2 from previous marriage. \n\nWhen we met he wasn\u2019t the most loving/affectionate man and I had to stifle my affection and expressions of love bcoz he didn\u2019t like all that soppy stuff.\n\nHe has always been very to the point and VERY honest, which was a breath of fresh air bcoz it never left me wondering. Sometimes. He was very private and secretive and took me ages to even learn his surname and I only found that out by accident and he got mad about that.\n\nThings have always been rocky but he has always charmed his way back into my good books.\n\nWhen we first started arguing and he abusively attacked me, I couldn\u2019t quite believe anyone would speak to me like that. But I forgave him and we carried on.\n\nHe got more loving over the years and he always spoilt me with gifts and trips and spent \u00a31000\u2019s on me. Which he likes to remind me. I try to be grateful as much as I can.\n\nI get travel anxiety and sometimes freak out when I\u2019m trapped in car (or somewhere without access to a toilet quickly) and the first time we went for a weekend away, I had a panic but instead helping me, he had a go at me and made me feel 100% worse and has continued to whenever it happens.\n\nHe flies off the handle about the smallest of things. He moved in with me and my kids in Jan this year and bcoz he is a bit of a clean freak/germaphobe if there is even a crumb left out he goes made. We also got engaged this year (god knows why!)\n\nHe shouts at my kids and punishes them as he says I have no control. My kids are good, kind, loving kids.\n\nI started keeping voices recordings one day of every time me had an argument and how he would speak to me bcoz I didn\u2019t think anyone would believe me. \n\nI am overweight and he says he won\u2019t marry me till I\u2019ve lost weight. So things I get called/to said to me/screamed at me are:\n\nFat\nLazy\nCunt\nBitch\nSlag \nNo wonder my kids and family don\u2019t like me\nUngrateful\nBe nothing without him\nTold me to fuck off and die (my kids heard this)\nDirty and disgusting \nUgly \nEtc he even takes a pop at my kids calling them names to me or so they can hear.\n\nI don\u2019t see my family anymore as he thinks they are poisoning me and kids against him.\nHe constantly pervs over other girls. I honestly don\u2019t know why I\u2019m with him. \n\nIf I try and argue my side of anything he says I\u2019m being gobby and the sooner I learn he is in charge the better we will get on.\n\nHe pinches my cheek really hard bcoz he knows I don\u2019t like it, so hard once it made me cry, or grabs my thigh and he knows it hurts and just laughs it off and gets in a mood if I react. He has threatened to hit me as he says I get him that mad. \n\n\nI have tried to leave him many times but he gets aggressive and threatens to tell my secrets and has threatened to expose intimate pics and it\u2019s a \u2018war\u2019 and if I try anything I won\u2019t like it etc. I just want a clean break.\n\nI\u2019ve tried speaking to him but he won\u2019t listen.

I read it from time to time as a reminder to myself concerning how the situation made me feel. Wrote it as if she would read it. \n\nJust to clarify, I'm sure many of you have experienced worse abuse over a prolonged time period, and I'm truly sorry if the confusion has caused a loss of \"self\" within you. But if you ask me, you're still in there, I don't know any of you, but you can and will find yourselves again. \n\nIt's ok to question your reality for a time, pain and sadness makes it easier to be kind and understanding towards others. I believe you AND the world will be a better place for you going through your own personal crucible. There's a light at the end of the tunnel, you just gotta keep walking. You fought a monster and have leveled up \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\n\nFor context, I dated a girl for about 3 months, saw some signs of entitlement, grandiosity, love bombing, projection, flying monkeys  etc, but decided to ignore it out of my own naivety. The rose colored glasses were firmly pressed to my face, but it's been about 45 days of no contact and I'd say I've replaced them with some dope shades. It was rough for a while, but my therapist helped. I have not blocked on social media yet, I simply altogether abstained from looking since I don't consistently use it, but I think that has prevented an immediate hoover. I'm debating whether or not I should drop this \"letter\" on her if a hoover does happen, but I'm leaning towards no and simply stating that I'm not interested in speaking, or not even replying at all. Sending it would probably just make the situation worse. \n\nRegardless, here's what I wrote, and I hope some of you can find some strength from it if that is at all possible. Any critique of my attitude throughout is welcome, and any advice is appreciated. I'm just a dude looking to understand others as well as myself. \n\n*Alright, I'm gonna set the record straight, don't bother replying if you can't handle my truth. I ain't gonna engage in a stupid conversation. \n\nAfter we \"met,\" we talked every day. Early on, you were incredibly forward, or at least you acted that way. Who the fuck knows whether or not that was truthful or not, there's no way for me to know.\n\nAll I really do know is that the interaction we had made me feel like garbage, for a time. Hear me out. I'm ok with being rejected. I'm ok with you not seeing a long term romance between the two of us. Wouldn't be the first time. I told you so many times when you brought up other guys that it is your right to reject them. I am not so entitled to think that I can push my agenda onto you. That would not line up with my definition of love and acceptance.\n\nWhat I am not ok with, is you twisting and reframing the story in such a manner that provokes me questioning myself and my reality. If you admit to knowing that I was interested in you while seemingly expressing interest of your own, and then willingly stating in our last interaction that you thought I asked you out as friends, well, I'd really hate to say it, that's hella contradictory and not something that a good friend would do. That is akin to, or straight up gaslighting. Google it. You definitely did not conduct yourself \"as a friend,\" and I definitely didn't conduct myself as just a friend. That is a massive cop out whether or not you know it. If you ain't looking for something more than friends, don't act as if you are, and if you found someone more interesting to you, or some other circumstance got in the way, just say it instead of resorting to bullshit. \n\nI am not somebody that you can toy with like that, not anymore. Maybe you can get away with that consistently with some other folks, but that says way more about you than it does about them. The simple act of playing mind games for the sake of stroking or saving your own ego is pathetic, and to lace it with lies and manipulation tactics to make me question my own self worth just indicates that you are incredibly full of yourself. \n\nFor example, accusing me of being nice with the expectation of receiving something is ultimately you projecting your subconscious mind onto me because it makes you feel better. Google psychological projection. I know myself. I willingly choose to be vulnerable and honest with my care or love for others. To some degree, all relationships are transactional. Give and take. But eventually, and sometimes pretty quickly, you reach a point with certain people that you would do anything for them without expectation, because you know (or think, sometimes out of naivety) they feel the same. Unfortunately, I don't think you operate on this wavelength right now. You are nice with the expectation of receiving attention, and you calling me out like that is simply your unconscious defense mechanism, because deep down you dislike this about yourself. Seems you thrive and live on attention, and you'll do whatever it takes to get some. Whether or not you wanna believe it, that's what I think. \n\nAfter some time apart, I've realized what ticks your boxes. If you've had so many flings that you can't even count, then you have made a habit of finding new sources to supply attention to distract you from that fragile ego of yours. Or maybe, you just get a kick out of gaming people. Either way, I am genuinely sorry for you. People do not hurt others unless they are hurting themselves. \n\nI think your metaphorical cup of life has a hole at the bottom. You seem to find people, maybe multiple people, that can fill up said cup and make you feel better. But really, I think the fundamental problem is that you are completely averse to thinking that you have to patch up the leak in your own cup, for yourself and by yourself. Maybe you're just afraid of patching it up. Regardless, no one can or will do it for you, despite what anyone might say. You have to totally own what it is you went through as a child or are currently going through as an adult, and bring your subconscious tendencies to the surface so that you can dictate your own future. If not, you will either find yourself in an abusive relationship (where you could potentially be the abuser) or simply alone and resentful of the fact that no one could fix the cup for you. It is OK to be without validation from others, the ultimate source of validation should come from within yourself. You would be wise to note that you have to be vulnerable and self aware of your own flaws for any true self respect to surface. \n\nYes, you're young, but that doesn't give you the right to play with people's feelings. Sure, maybe you have experienced trauma in your life that has contributed to your current predicament, but who the fuck hasn't experienced trauma to some degree. It's your responsibility to fix it, no one else's. To assume otherwise is delusional, and if you continue to think otherwise I can truly only see relationship misery in your future. \n\nMy suggestion to you: grow the fuck up, it's a choice, not an age thing. My parent's are fucked up too, it's hard. But it's no excuse. Accept responsibility and your own potential to have good and beneficial agency. Agency is not God given, it is earned by tempering your soul with the flames of our harsh reality. And that requires that you sit down and actually think about it. No amount of prayer will make up for the blaring hole in your heart. Only you can fix that. \n\nGenuinely, I want you to be happy. Life is temporary, and any amount of time spent in absolute misery is an absolute waste, unless it spurs growth. If you're repressing this misery and taking it out on yourself or others with no amount of learning, then you're doing yourself a genuine disservice. So, like all other people, you deserve happiness, but right now I don't think you do. Negative emotions are a catalyst for growth, and God knows you need some of that. Trust me, I've been there. \n\nLearn about yourself. Think about yourself. Think for yourself. Realize that everyone who grows up has to fix and maintain their cup. They have to sustain themselves. Why should you be any different? You have a time limit too, make the most of it without effectively wasting the time and energy of the potentially good people in your life. If you don't, you will never find a single ounce of genuine self respect within yourself.\n\nI'm not open to being your friend or anything else for that matter. A friend wouldn't treat me the way you did. The silver lining for you is, i have hope for you. You ain't stupid, and you at least have the ability to act kind. So integrate it, mean it, and don't shame yourself for being vulnerable with yourself or others. \n\nIf we come across each other and you have found a true self and abandoned this false bravado of confidence and security, if you have abandoned your desire to drain cups, if you have lost the desire to manipulate situations to best suit you despite the anguish it might cause for others, and if you have truly acknowledged your broken cup, then I will be your friend. But until then, do not contact or try to reconcile with me, because right now I cannot trust you, but maybe one day, circumstances permitting, I can. Even then, I will have my guard up. I cannot fix you, no one can but you. \n\nIf you want a \"too long, didn't read;\" \n\nUltimately, the only sway you should be concerned with is your own. Grow up, or stay away from me. I ain't gonna set myself on fire to keep you warm, learn to generate your own body heat. \n\nGood luck in your future endeavors.*\n\nThanks for reading, stay frosty fellas", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Now the relationship that once meant so much to me, the man I would cry over and go constantly out of my way for, feels like a distant fever dream. \n\nThose past two years are slowly being blotted out of my memory. I think back, and it mostly disturbs me how little connection I feel. I was very angry during the break up. Said some nasty things. Also said some sweet things. Was constantly confused. Constantly hopeful maybe he'd become the sweet, understanding man I'd once thought he could be, but looking back, he never truly, deeply was. \n\nNow, looking back, I can't remember what it felt like to love him. I can't remember what it felt like to be angry at him. I can't remember what it felt like to even sit next to him or kiss him. Not viscerally. It brings no emotion. There is nothing. \n\nIs this unhealthy? Is this what moving on feels like? I honestly do still think about him everyday, but I have zero desire to speak to him. I feel sorry for him. That's the only thing I feel. I feel sorry that he is so lost. Sorry that he is so disconnected from the world, from beauty and from joy for life. I feel sorry that his family is so distant emotionally from each other. I feel sorry that his fate seems sealed, living a bleak, colorless life. \n\nI do think he loved me. I think he loved me more than he had loved anyone. I see how he cared for me and there were sweet times. But because he couldn't control or face the monster inside him, he lost me. And I stopped loving him. \n\nIt feels like I picked up where I left off when we got together. Like that was just a 2 year bleep in my personal history and now here I am again, living the life I had before. Except much better in many respects. Worse in others (still working on a good routine and personal care like working out). \n\nDoes anyone have a similar experience? I don't want this to be the way I handle things.

My mother had a hard time believing me but we are gonna have more further talks. \n\nImma mom asked me what\u2019s was wrong since my uncle had been visiting and said there was a whole a lot going on. So I told her that when I was a little girl, 12-14/15years old, he would touch me inappropriately.\n\nNot just a quick brush, we are talking, when I innocently sat on his lab while we watched tv in his basement, he would unsip my pants and stuff his hand *down there* and as soon as he heard footsteps on the staircase, he would close my pants up again and even stuff my shirt in it, because that\u2019s how I wear it. That he would ask me for kisses, saying a *real* kiss so he was eventually the person who taught me French kissing. He was also the first to \u201ccomplain\u201d that I was wearing a \u201cbra\u201d (one of those silly ones you get when you just begin puberty) because he stumbled upon it when he grabbed under my shirt, to feel my breast. When ever we went upstairs, he would grab me between my legs, with such force I\u2019d barely need to walk the stairs on my own.\n\nHe would always tickle me, because I\u2019d try to take his hands away from my crotch and a little tickle would make me defenseless, as it does, which also means to everybody nearby, out of sight, I was *laughing* and we had fun ofcourse! I guess this is the gist of it, but it all began when I was these 12years old (I had a kale set that year where I had written a specific medical procedure in and i kept that kalebderbhanging for years just looking back at this summer day: a day where we sat in my room, he unzipped my pants and I struggled to get him off (12ys fighting a grown up mechanic? No chance) and eventually he said asked me to *never* tell this to anyone, because it could mean jail for him and did I want that? Ofcourse in my young head I didn\u2019t wanna loose my only fatherfigure, basically the only adult male in our very small family, so I kept the secret.\n\nUntil bedtime. Where I cried out loud until my mom hear and came to console me. She made me show on a teddy(?) where \u201che had touched me\u201d and promised to handle it, whereas the following day came home and said she had spoken to him and he promised to stop. He didn\u2019t. Did they even ever speak?\n\nI\u2019ve been to therapy when I was in a really dark place a few years later and we mainly talked about this, what he did to me. My mom now has a theory that I mentioned something vague and the therapist spinner it into a giant case of being molested. Neither does she believe I ever told her because that\u2019s something she would definitly have reacted on. Why didn\u2019t I tell her again if it continued? I didn\u2019t know when she asked but now I believe it was because in my head \u201cI told and nothing changed, guess I gotta fight this on my own\u201d. Now that I tried to confront him about out \u201csecret\u201d and told him how much I despise him and hate him? Turns out he didn\u2019t understand what I babbling about (that meeting in person was also so blurry for me and I didn\u2019t get to say stuff clearly) and he says he doesn\u2019t remember having done anything bad towards me. Now I\u2019m waiting to talk further with my mom tomorrow and I\u2019m just so hurt that she instantly took all the lighter parts of our convo and said they were natural stuff (sitting on a lab is natural, to which I asked \u201cwhat about the opening my pants and stuffing his hand in there, huh???\u201d) so I guess she is fixated on a shrink having had a field day brainwashing me despite me telling this secret to boyfriend years before the physiatrist meeting (sex was so difficult because I was so scared of contact \u201cdown there\u201d). \n\nA part of me never wanted him jailed because he is important to my family, but a part of me want him to pay. So I tried to black mail him, a \u201cI\u2019ll keep your secret and you give me money\u201d and he did. But apparently he wasn\u2019t sure why so now that\u2019s also in the mix. To me it was a \u201cif I have to suffer for your secret, you better pay me for it\u201d, but he is hard of hearing so most of our troublesome vague conversation went all over his head. But he hasn\u2019t eaten since it happened, ca a week, and has considered suicide and this is where I\u2019m questioning *why*? If you don\u2019t think you did anything why do you wanna die? I can\u2019t help but think he remembers *something* because he actually said that (\u201cI don\u2019t remember all that\u2019s happened but what can we do about it\u201d) and now we are here. I couldn\u2019t stand being home so I ran to my boyfriend to spend the night and am going to talk to my mother tomorrow evening. My mother did raise us to be able to set boundaries and tell anything and has done talked to people about keeping their distance, so she finds it hard that I didn\u2019t feel comfortable telling her. Again, I\u2019m sure I did but believes she thought I had a nightmare and since I never brought it up after, why continue digging, all the while I felt neglected and thought I\u2019d had to deal with it on my own. It\u2019s long been something I thought I\u2019d only have the courage to tell her on her deathbed, but at the same time didn\u2019t want to break her heart for not having protected me enough and now I deal with that too, cuz she did say she was sorry for not protecting me during this. \n\nThis has been enough already so thank you if you took your time. I just wanna move out asap but know we have to deal with this as a \u201cfamily\u201d first at least. Guess Christmas is gonna be fun this year.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

My mom had breast cancer and almost died from it, and at 46 years old, it's scary to contemplate.

We broke up and I didn't flinch.  Guess that wasn't what he was hoping for though. He emailed my 16 year old daughter to say that I had BPD and sent a bunch of links to prove he was right. We had a good laugh over that - my previous 26 year marriage (exhubby and I are still very close and coparent wonderfully) and 20 plus year friendships apparently mean I'm unable to retain close relationships? My kids are well adjusted, happy and doing well both socially and academically.  Meanwhile, one of his kids has had multiple hospitalizations for mental health issues and the other basically dropped out of school at age 13.  Oh, and the 13 year old threatened to kill me in my sleep and told me to drop dead. Guess what?

This past year, there have been many moments where I realized that XYZ was abuse or have remembered things I had buried deep within my memories. I have gained a new perspective on many things, and recently, this has also included a peculiar thing my parents did:\n\nFrom an early age on, I didn't like going barefoot. I just never liked it and it seems overrated to me and I found it rather icky to say the least to see people walking barefoot in public places or in nature where animals defecate, people spit on the ground etc. Well, my parents apparently had a problem with that and would bother me about it for years, sometimes outright forcing me to go barefoot despite my repeated protests. Despite the fact that I repeatedly said I don't like it and I don't want to do it. In hindsight, this clearly fit into the pattern of my mother trying to fix things about me she didn't like/relate to. She also said that if I dislike being barefoot and avoid it, I will develop a foot fetish. I was 7 or 8 at the time when my mother told me that. Besides the fact that I was very young when she decided to warn me about a sexual fetish, I also don't see why a potential foot fetish is such a huge threat that it requires forcing a child to do something they don't want. It is most likely because a foot fetish is not normal, and apparently not being normal is a terrible sin or something. The more I think about it, the more this actually seems like it would be counterproductive. Forcing a child against their will to take off clothing items is not preventing fetishes.\n\nAlso, one of the many other things my mother especially did was complain about trouble and work I was causing, and how I shouldn't complain about anything due to that. I used to misbehave in school and get into trouble and fights, but my behavior was easily traced back to bullying, abuse, neglect and being chronically underchallenged in school. I basically ticked the marks on most of the telltale signs of child abuse, and nobody even noticed. Not the teachers, not the psychiatrists, not the social workers.\n\nI was wondering what you guys think about this and if anyone else here has been or is being forced to go barefoot (or anything similar). Or if your parents complained about how much trouble and work you caused them.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Today was my only day off after working 6 days in a row (they were short hours but its a deli so i'm practically running back and forth fighting through hoards of costumers, lifting 50 pounds of salads) so i wanted to relax, my mom on the other hand wanted to clean, I was just chilling and said I was tired and i wanted to rest today (i go back to work tomorrow). So something happens and she starts arguing with me about how she works all the time (despite the fact that she doesn't have an actual job she lays around more than anything) and i said \"Yeah I do too, i work at work. and i've been helping with chores\". and she makes some kind of joke about how she should write down every time i do chores to prove that i don't do them or something, and for some reason this just struck me and i started crying and i slammed my hands on the table and just had a meltdown (i'd been stressed all week from work and i guess i really didn't need to hear that). My brother got really pissed off at me and started screaming at me to shut the fuck up, and he was telling me to go to my room (like bitch you're not my father i am NOT listening to you) and I told him \"No i'm not going to my room i'm too upset to clean it right now\" because he was also yelling at me to go clean my room, and he got right into my ear and started screaming and i told him to get the fuck away from me. I ended up going outside for some reason and my neighbors (who we've always had problems with) i assumed at the time they were mocking me because I was having a full meltdown and i told them to shut the fuck up before i beat the shit out of them. My brother assumed I was talking about him and said \"I'd like to see you fucking try\" and sprinted right toward me with his fist clenched at me and naturally i tried to duck and yelled \"Don't you fucking touch me\". He starts screaming at me more saying i'm acting like I child and that i'm 19 and need to grow up.   \nI eventually got up and went to my room put on different clothes and went to the park and walked around and sat down a couple times in random places. I couldn't speak because my lungs hurt from yelling and i couldn't feel anything, i wanted to die so bad, I was thinking of jumping in front of a car so many times, or just running off and killing myself somewhere.

I left high school and started working full time when I was 17, and my mom told me I had to contribute to household expenses if I wasn\u2019t going to be in school. That all sounded fair to me, but as her relationship with her terrible now ex-husband (not my biological father) got worse, I started taking on more and more responsibility until it got to the point where he paid nothing and my mom and I paid for everything. He stopped paying utilities, rent, cable,  etc. I have four younger siblings (age 16, 10, 7 + 5) and I don\u2019t ever want them to go without, so slowly all the bills were switched into my name because they were all about to be shut off, and my siblings need electricity, heat, you know, basic stuff. \n\nThen my mom quit her job, which she\u2019d had for a couple years (she wasn\u2019t working before because her terrible ex-husband promised her he\u2019d take care of everything. Why she believed him is beyond me). Now, because deadbeat didn\u2019t pay for anything that left all the responsibility on me. I was 18 then. \n\nFast forward to last year, she finally kicked deadbeat out and got a restraining order. She had a couple of jobs for a couple of months in the last few years, but nothing ever stuck because she says she\u2019s too anxious to work (but doesn\u2019t go to therapy or seek out ways to help herself be less anxious). When he left, we were BROKE. Like so broke that she had to beg for food at a convenience store. I had already stepped up but then I really had to because he was completely out of the picture. He was court ordered to pay her $600 a week in child support for their four children together. Sounds awesome, right? Wrong. \n\nI have become the SOLE breadwinner in my house. I\u2019m a full time server at a busy restaurant and I make GOOD money, but week after week I find myself broke. Why? Because I pay for all the bills except for food in my house. Utilities, internet, cell phone bills, and whatever else my mom needs ON TOP of my own bills. Food is covered by EBT (my mom receives about $700 a month is assistance), and my mom is supposed to pay for half of all the bills because that\u2019s what we agreed on when deadbeat finally hit the bricks. But every week her $600 is spent on weed, cigarettes, sometimes groceries if she runs out of food stamps, and small things my siblings need. She hasn\u2019t had a job in almost two years and has made no move to get one since she left her last one in April of last year.  This past tax season, I claimed my siblings as dependents (because I paid for almost all their expenses) and was entitled to a $13k tax return. She took $11k because I argued with her about how I was entitled to some, and spent it all on absolutely nothing and it was gone in two months. When my siblings are at school and I\u2019m at work, she sits around the house all day sleeping and smoking weed.\nWhenever I try to ask her for the money back for whatever bills I\u2019ve paid for that week, she gets upset because she won\u2019t have money for weed or cigarettes if she pays me back. It becomes such a huge argument that I\u2019ve stopped asking.\n\nBut things don\u2019t stop there. I work 50 hours a week, and whenever I\u2019m home and she\u2019s in a mood, she likes to harp on me for not helping around the house (even though I pay all the bills), and when that\u2019s not enough she\u2019ll go on a tangent about how I\u2019m selfish, ungrateful, and lazy. If I DARE to bring up my contributions to our house she screams at me about how she raised me and my older brother (who also lives at home) essentially by herself and went to school full time and worked full time. Sometimes I\u2019ll be sitting on the couch after work and she\u2019ll ask me why I have a problem with her when I haven\u2019t said anything. Every single time I say something she doesn\u2019t like she calls me petty and passive aggressive. She loves to bring up how awful her own childhood was (even though my brother physically abused me for years growing up), and tells me I should be grateful that she raised me the way she did and I should be grateful she brought me into the world.\n\nI am drowning under the responsibility of an entire household. I recently got my associates degree and was supposed to go on to a four year school but I couldn\u2019t pay tuition because of my other financial obligations. My credit is terrible because she would take all of my money (we used to share a bank account and she\u2019d spend every penny in it), and I had to put all of the bills on my credit cards.

For context: mom was emotionally and verbally abused by my grandma and she had an abusive relationship in college before she met my dad. \n\nIs it normal for my mom to be pissed at her me all the time and be passive-aggressive and petty about every little thing?  \n\nMy mom has always butted heads with me. I love her a lot, but I avoid going downstairs because I always get questioned or insulted or criticized for stuff. I have anxiety, depression, and ADHD, which already puts me at a disadvantage because although I have meds, my mom just turns a lot around on me and being on my phone. I am on my phone a lot, but not obsessively like other kids. I get good grades, occasionally do stupid stuff but never get in trouble with the law, and I have a good head on my shoulders with a no-bullshit attitude. \n\nThe other day I closed for my job, got home at 11, and went to bed at 11:30. Woke up the next day and parked in a parking spot that I didn\u2019t have the right sticker for because I was so tired and I didn\u2019t really care, plus I never really got in trouble for parking around there before. I got reported and now I have Wednesday night school (basically 2 hrs and 30 mins of detention) and I was just gonna do it and not tell my mom cause I knew she\u2019d FREAK. I told her I had a bad day, and she asked me what was so bad about it. I told her the story, and she fucking flipped out. She went off saying how I was being an asshole and that I COMPLETELY deserved it. I ended up laughing hysterically after I admitted that I didn\u2019t really care that I parked in someone else\u2019s spot and she asked me if I needed to switch meds. Throughout the argument, she kept mentioning how she was the only one who did anything around the shouse and how hard SHE has it, and that she \u201cknows\u201d I like being around my boyfriend and his family a lot more than my own family (because he\u2019s so good and kind to me and his mom is a literal angel who understands what I\u2019m going through). Somehow the convo ended up to talking about my therapist. My mom complained that I was acting like she was my \u201cbest friend\u201d and that I didn\u2019t need to see her, and then falsely reassured me that I could talk to her (my mom) instead. I don\u2019t talk to my mom because I always get yelled at for talking about something she doesn\u2019t like, and I like to talk to my therapist because she helps me work through things calmly and genuinely treats me like I\u2019m a good person. My mom only agreed to let me see her if I wrote down what I needed to work on. Then when my dad got home, she brought him into the argument as well. I was sobbing the whole time. \n\nTonight, she yelled at me for not saying hi with my bf when we came home from a long trip to search for his best friend\u2019s birthday present (an all-might figure) and did it in front of him.

I don't know where to post this as I am still very lost of what to do and still dealing with the rush of emotions that came after saving someone's life.\n\nI (20F) have previously entered into an abusive relationship and have since ended it. If you are interested please read my post history. After breaking up, I kept in contact with my ex as he said he still loved me and will do anything to take me back, most importantly, he said he would kill himself if I didn't talk to him. After months of him telling me that he was binge drinking and wanted to kill himself, I finally got the courage to tell him that I wanted to keep minimum contact with him. I didn't want to bear the burden of constantly worrying about someone, when I already have my own depression and anxiety disorder to deal with. \n\nAnd then it happened. It was 18th  September. I said I didn't want to speak to him. He replied with, well I have no one and nothing to live for, goodbye. He also sent me a picture of him hanging a rope onto a tree. He told me where he was, on the back field of his parents house. He said goodbye, not taking my calls or replying to my texts. It was like the end of the world for me. How does one survive knowing that you might be the cause of someone ending their life?\n\nI called 999, got connected to the police from Northern Ireland (I was in London) and 10 policemen was sent to his house. I contacted his parents who were out of the country. I contacted his estranged sisters who lived close to where he was. I was in shambles. Luckily they got to him before he did it. The police said he was committed to doing it. I cut contact with him after knowing that he was in the hospital, even though he told me he loved me and please don't leave him. He had his parents calling me telling me that he loved me. \n\nThe morning after I couldn't go to work. I cut myself so bad that I had to go to the hospital myself. I still do not know how to deal with the emotional shitshow that I had just been through. \n\nI now understand he was toxic to me. And I have cut all contact with him.

{"post_id": "d6uz84", "created_utc": 1568986381, "title": "Very lost", "author": "Omnivion", "self_text": "This will likely be a bit lengthy.  \nI feel a little lost overall.  \nI guess to put things into context before I continue, this is my life up till now:  \nI was born 5th of 10 into a Quiverfull cult.  \nI had no childhood friends.  \nI spent almost all of my time before I escaped inside of a decrepit Victorian house in the middle of nowhere, or at an insane church at which my family were pariahs for being even more extreme than them.  \nWe were all homeschooled, raised without medical care/vaccines/antibiotics, raised to have a very negative view of gays, muslims, atheists, evolution, anything to the left of theocratic fascism (\"George Bush was too liberal\").  \nThe internet was censored, all media was controlled and censored, every meaningful variable of our lives were controlled by them.  \n\n\nFather was an abusive tyrant. The sort of person who would enter the house after work and aggressively verbally berate and scold anyone if their area was at all a mess, and with 9 siblings, there were always random items pulled out or messes created. That was almost a daily occurrence.  \nHe would also dispense violent punishments, whenever he felt it was justified.  \nHe had a block of would that he would swing, and one day he broke it over my older brother, and the only realisation he had was that he needed a denser block of wood.  \nI acquired the most severe bruising I have ever had, by far, from that denser block of wood.  \nThings progressively became more religiously insane as things progressed.  \nThey were always quite extreme, and kept the views that would place them as all out extremists hidden from us until right around the time I turned 18.  \nAt that point, they had reached their newest evolution, which combined the extremist views they hid, along with a new set of variables that would be forced upon us.  \nMessianic Judaism.  \n\"Jesus came not to abolish the law, but to fulfill it\", therefore Old Testament law was still completely valid in their eyes, and furthermore, should be federal law.  \nEvery friday at sundown was Shabbat, and at the start of Shabbat we were forced into a room to hear an indoctrination session. A fusion of Old Testament law and theocratic fascism merged into one.  \nI rejected this, and ultimately after searching out my own answers, became an atheist.  \nStarting at the age of 10 or 11 I figured out how to circumvent the internet blocks, using Google Translate as a proxy, translating webpages from a language it was not, \"into\" English, allowing me to view anything.  \nI used the internet to self educate, as mother had no real interest in investing any time into actually educating us, despite her expectation that we would all be a part of the intellectual elite, which she would no doubt take full credit for.  \nAlmost all social interaction I had before my escape, and to a large extent, most post-escape, was/has been on the internet.  \nMost of what we were taught, was complete bullshit.  \nHow the south was right in the civil war, how slavery wasn't as bad as people make it sound, how \"Muslims derive their ancestry from Ishmael, the son born out of the whore Hagar, and that is why they are a problem today. Because Ishmael wasn't dealt with then, which is why they need to be dealt with now.\", how science is a lie, and a lot more.  \nIt was hell, and not just because of the parents either.  \n\n\nMy older siblings were quite a contribution of their own.  \nThe oldest fancied herself the enforcer. Starting when I was fairly young, if I said anything she didn't like, she would grab me by the hair of my scalp and pull quite hard, or alternatively, start walking down the hallway while holding onto my hair.  Today she has half a dozen kids that she's brainwashing.  \nThe second oldest was always a complete and total bitch. Spineless as hell, self-righteous as fuck, a snitch, and closely aligned with father, which allowed her to not face very much criticism. Today she has two, I believe, and will undoubtedly continue breeding unfortunate children as she was raised to.  \nThe third oldest, my older brother, was heavily abused by father, because he wasn't really one to exercise punishments on my sisters, which meant they could get away with quite a lot, while the males were subject to his abuse.  \nWhile that part does make me understand his behaviour to some degree, he was also the one who sexually coerced me when I was 7 years old. He and I didn't really talk for about 11 or so years, and he did apologise profusely, but I'm still unsure what to really think about it, especially given that in one of our most recent conversations, whether intentionally or not, I began to notice a pattern that was approaching gaslighting. Portions of my perspective or understanding of things, my lack of trust in people, were dismissed as irrationality or confirmation bias, objective fact was dismissed as statistically unlikely, or repeated back to me in a way that vastly obfuscates what I actually stated. My desire to become a doctor was repeatedly compared to my father's fruitless dream of acquiring wealth, and I was accused of being too much like him, the person I hate most in this world, in that regard.   \nThe fourth oldest, my third sister, while she was one of the only people I really talked to, she had a tendency to throw me under the bus, and/or lie to avoid consequence.  \nAs such, starting at age 7 I first considered killing myself.  \nThe last time I considered it was 10 days ago, right before the three year anniversary of my escape.  \n\n\nAround the time that I escaped, I set up a pattern of going outside in the afternoons for a walk outside.  \nShortly after, I started smuggling packages out to the post office, as I was selling almost everything I owned on eBay.  \nI then funnelled all the money into an online bank account, purchased and smuggled in a mobile phone and sim card that I activated through a now-defunct Sprint MVNO with no monthly fee, providing me phone service without haemorrhaging what limited resources I had.  \nI also set up a gofundme that I promoted exclusively within a private atheist group on Facebook, which added $600 to the $1600 I made from selling on eBay.  \nAt that point, I had to act quickly, because father had begun to make certain power plays in the indoctrination sessions, largely aimed at me. I was the oldest at home, as my older siblings married their way out (save for my older brother, who got out at 17 after seizing and falling down the stairs during a seizure, resulting in someone taking him in), and I was labelled a disruptive influence, as I started establishing a long term plan when I was 18, to slowly chip away at their image of a perfectly compliant son, by arguing against more minor points.  \nI want to be sure that if they discovered my secrets, that they would be unsurprised but disappointed, rather than potentially homicidally furious, given that father would emphasise that the Old Testament law is THE law, even after reading in Deuteronomy where it states that if a virgin is raped, the rapist is to pay a fee and marry her, and that a married woman is to be stoned with her rapist, and relevantly, that \"you must bring out to your gates that man or woman who has done this evil thing, and stone that person to death \" on the subject of not adhering to religion.  \nI found a computer science school in the Fremont, California, called 42, with no tuition or housing fees, and passed through all of their pre-tests to get invited to a month-long crash course admittance test.  \nIt seemed like a viable way to go about it, as it could provide everything I needed, with almost no financial investment required.  \nMost of all, father has done programming for more than 20 years, and always wanted someone to share his interest, so the idea of me returning after a month (which is all I told them about-- the month long crash course), and having more in common, it worked.  \nSince things had escalated so much, I moved my time table up a month, as father was on the verge of discovering everything, and he drove me to the Amtrak station in Dallas, finalising my escape.  \n\n\nPost escape life has been difficult, because as one would imagine, there's a lot to sort through.  \nI spent hundreds, possibly thousands of hours into reading and research, to try to ensure that I wouldn't waste my opportunity if I ever made it out alive.  \nI moved to Seattle, ended up staying in my at the time manager's residence, with his mother, in a vacant room that was once lived in by his brother.  \nWhat I didn't know at the time was that his brother moved to the other end of the US to escape his mother, who was also a tyrant. I woke up one day to her screaming outside of my door that I was corrupting her son, because she read through her son's texts while he was asleep, and saw the part where I mentioned how atrociously she treats him, and his response that he was hoping that he, his sister, and I would be able to move out together.  \nI ended up leaving Seattle, and gained a little hope, because there was a girl that I really liked that I met in a psychology group online. We started a long distance relationship, and quite eager to be with someone who would genuinely care about me, after everything I had gone through, I was overly idealistic, and perhaps an easy target.  \nShe wasn't what I had hoped by any means. After being treated quite poorly, shamed for being impoverished, and given the expectation that I make 75K a year or more, I ended things, but made the stupid decision to stay friends with someone who was dehumanising and narcissistic, purely because I had no one else.  \nI landed a job at the same place she worked, excelled quite a bit, won a company award for systematising almost all of the processes relevant to my job, allowing me to reach 300% the average productivity rate, and ultimately left so I could begin studying. The school fucked up everything, and it was one of the only schools that was within what I could afford with FAFSA, as I couldn't take out private loans without a cosigner, so I went back to what I was doing before that job to prevent me from becoming homeless again, and became a human test subject for clinical trials once again.\n\nThings are a little more stable overall, and I'm looking at going into the Air Force so that I can make my way through university to become a doctor.  \nI've already done a sizable amount of pre-studying to make it less difficult once I do go to med school, and also to try to medically fix myself as much as humanly possible, but I'm left with a lot of confusion that chemicals can't resolve.  \nI don't really know how to connect with most people. Tbh, I don't even like most people.  \nSome people seem nice, but there's absolutely nothing in common at all.  \nSo many people just seem dishonest, petty, manipulative, etc.  \nI have met a few genuinely good people, and I value their friendship, but it's quite difficult.  \nI'm somewhat socially blind, extremely perfectionist, I am in a constant state of calculation for my future, making sure that all plans are absolutely perfect, I don't really know how to relax all that well, because if I'm not working toward my goals I feel as though I'm not doing enough.  \nI do sometimes wonder whether I'll ever find an ideal relationship because that is ultimately what I want most in life. Someone who genuinely cares about me, who will never betray me.  \nEverything I do, everything I write, I can imagine a dozen different criticisms.  \nI'm somewhat afraid of making a mistake, and I don't always know the rules of society.  \nAs a result, I follow strictly to what I see as ethical, to avoid hypocrisy as much as humanly possible.  \nStill, coming from extreme social isolation, I sometimes see people throw comments at me.  \nI'm not overly expressive, so I get labelled a school shooter by someone who doesn't even know me.  \nI hesitate to really socially engage, because I don't want to be invasive, or be labelled \"creepy\".  \nI just want to be understood, but even that seems like a lofty goal sometimes.  \nI've internalised so many things that I don't even know how to view myself accurately, which only fuels the criticisms, which I guess should be referred to as intrusive thoughts.  \nI kind of picture someone reading this, thinking only that I'm overly dysfunctional, perhaps arrogant for mentioning my work at my last job, that I've made all of this up, that I have few friends because there is something wrong with me, and any number of things I've heard before. It kind of weighs me down sometimes.  \n10 days ago, when I considered ending things, I could imagine people I know either only remembering the defects, or forgetting about me altogether, which tbh I found preferable, because sometimes I genuinely do wish to erase all evidence of my existence and be forgotten.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I ran into an ex by pure chance a few months ago after not seeing him for 13+ years. We had a toxic relationship with some of the highest highs and lowest lows. It took me a really long time to heal from the trauma. He's very narcissistic and triggers me like no one else. He' has always been that 'what if' person in my life.  I'm in a very healthy, long term relationship now and do not want to leave my partner. The thing is, my ex and I had a nice chat and actually felt like we came to some closure on our past. We exchanged numbers - which was a big mistake. Flash forward a few months and we have been texting pretty much everyday. At first, I got sucked into feelings of nostalgia and enjoyed reminiscing. Then I felt extreme guilt for what I was doing to my current partner so I tried to cut off communication. My ex assured me that this was just friendly and he appreciated my friendship. So, I continued with the chatting. We developed what I thought was a genuine friendship but I realize that I've been letting him cross my boundaries. (Making jokes about my partner, getting flirty, and even sending pics - all G rated but still feels wrong). Now it's gotten to the point where I find myself addicted to this person again - wanting and needing his attention. He's single and though it has not been overtly stated, there's an undercurrent of sexual tension. I've been backing off the conversation and trying to focus on my actual relationship and he's of course showing classic N behavior and I'm getting triggered. If I don't answer him right away in the evenings (when he knows I'm with my partner) he'll send a bunch of messages and provoke me to answer because he knows my triggers. I feel like I'm balancing 2 relationships. I know the thing to do is ignore, but part of me worries that he will retaliate in a way that would affect my current relationship. And of course, there's that addiction to this person. Should I try to have the conversation about why I need to back away or do I just ghost him? Is there ever a way to stay friends w/ a N-ex?

I am still recovering and quite honestly still coming to terms with what happened, how far reaching the effects are and how I can progress. I became badly ill after leaving and I still have dreams or nightmares featuring him most nights.\n\nToday, one of my best friends told me she heard through a mutual friend of ours that my ex is seeing or has seen an old acquiaintance of mine. My stomach dropped. I used to kind of know her, but we were never close and I never really got along with her. We never had a falling-out, I would be polite but my friends at the time knew I was not keen. I haven't seen her in perhaps three years though, and those friends 2 years (I lost them during the relationship).\n\n I know that I have to establish if she is indeed with him and to warn her to get the fuck away, but it's going to look like some pathetic jealous high school shit, surely. This is not at all to say that my reputation is more important than her safety (I couldn't give a fuck about the opinion of my old circle of friends that she was on the periphary of); but I am worried sick that these previous feelings of animosity will somehow dampen or twist my message. He never knew my feelings about her, at least. Nothing to say someone wouldn't have told him I suppose.\n\nWhat if my old feelings toward her somehow get in the way of a warning? I mean, do warnings tend to go down well anyway? I know I'm not directly responsible for anything that happens but I can't help but feel that in some way, my old negative feelings towards her could potentially lead to her being in more danger... It's like a cosmic joke.\n\nI have been entertaining some strange hypothetical thoughts for the past few months, like \"what if my ex was right about religion and he is using God to punish me\", because I have noticed some really strange coincidences recently, but this is really really not helping. I know it's ridiculous, and if there is a God, they wouldn't spend time spiting me because one person asked, surely, but that one strange thought pops into my head from time to time. God wouldn't do this for someone like him, unless he really *was* right and I was totally wrong. It makes no sense, I know. The potential for my previous dislike of someone to potentially nullify a warning towards her? It makes me hate myself pre-emptively, to be safe, y'know?\n\nI am horrified for her, absolutely horrified. Having a face to his next victim is making me feel so fucking sick. Now I don't know for sure that she is *with* him, but from what I heard she *had* seen him, which is more than enough to terrify me for her. I hate thinking about what he's doing to other people because I feel like maybe if I reported him sooner he might be away by now, but knowing the person is another kind of hell. It also means he is most certainly still in my part of the world too. I was just getting used to not imagining bumping into him every time I went to town. I still sleep with a weapon by my bed and one by my garage. It isn't legal to carry a knife here, but I wish I could. I nearly jumped out my skin earlier today because I was out, having a nice time in town with my friend when my brain said \"Hey imagine if he saw you and came up behind you and put you in a chokehold?\", like, I suppose I'm back to that now.\n\nI wish the police would hurry up, I wish I could show them and whoever else needs to a direct recording of my memories so they can just lock him away. I gave a 5 hour statement a few months ago and I've heard nothing. I'm struggling so hard with the thought of him being allowed to continue being this awful, disgusting person and hurting anyone that he brings into his life.\n\nI don't know what to write to her, and I'm going to have to think really carefully about how to word it to her. I mean, I can show her the emails that at least prove that I broke up with him, so that might make her at least believe it isn't coming from a place of jealousy but I'm so scared of saying the wrong thing and I can just picture her asking him, him lying so easily. That's if they are still together... I'm going to first need to find out for sure if she is out or not.\n\nI'm just so sick of this. It never really ended, did it?", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I joined a company 6 months ago. While technically J. outranks me, we are, on paper, equal in experience.\n\nJ. turned hostile on my very first day, after I pointed out an issue and explained why it isn't the best way of doing things. People in our department (I came to call his entourage) also did so pretty much immediately and without provocation.\n\nOur boss is more concerned with performance and not office drama, and so am I. I just sat down and got to work. Fast forward a month and we essentially formed two parallel departments, one with J. and his entourage and one with me and random people from other teams helping out once they noticed that things are getting done for a change.\n\nPerformance review was like something out of a cult meeting. One lady used a phrase \"so handsome and intelligent\" with respect to J. I obviously got blamed by them for everything. However nature of our job is such that they cannot misattirbute my work to them and their mistakes to me. At the end of the day there are numbers and they don't lie. So the higher ups probably wrote it off as personality conflict, they were certainly not stupid enough to discipline someone who doubled the work done single-handedly, so I think all complaints from the entourage (and there were lots of them) were nodded to and then ignored.\n\nOne week ago I noticed a pattern of irregularities. Turns out J has been cooking the books. It is serious. Shareholders will need to be notified. It might be even on the local news as the company is both publicly traded and a large local employer. Maybe even police, but IANAL. Given the gravity, I spent the last week preparing a full written report.\n\nSo we come to the present day. I am briefing my boss on Monday morning. Full 200 pages of it are right in front of me. Right now I'm the only person that knows its contents, and I'm pretty much expecting all hell to break loose - it certainly would have much sooner if I told anyone from J's entourage.\n\nI got a trusted person from HR to email J's university. They have no record of him. Turns out he is a fraud right down to a fake diploma. The email went in as an appendix.\n\nThe two questions on my mind are:\n\n1. What should I expect from J and his entourage?\n\n2. Even with J out of the picture, how do I build a healthy relationship with the entourage?

I am certain I come from a wealthier background (monetary wealth) than she does, so her snobbiness from fake wealth irritates me. I was raised on the belief of volunteering time and kindness to promote the well being of any individual, so I don't flaunt my monetary wealth all too much. She sadly interprets me as not having ANY money and ,therefore, sadly, even more of a pushover. \n\nAfter observing her behavior for some time now, she only turns on the charm with white people, men of any ethnicity, and females either who have very traditionally feminine behavior or females who were previously in sororities.\n\nHer entitled and belittling behavior has gotten a lot worse recently with her engagement to a man from a wealthy family. After getting engaged, she started to plan details of the wedding instead of doing work and started to wear white all the time--almost as if having a wedding is her raison d'etre and pinnacle moment of her life. Another coworker has said that her parents sold their house to finance her wedding.\n\nShe has repeatedly made it extremely clear to me and my fellow coworkers that she is sponging off of her parents to maintain her current lifestyle and is hoping that her future husband will continue to finance the same lifestyle. In other words, I think she unintentionally  admitted to being a gold digger while thinking she was actually boasting about free money?\n\nShe shows signs of orthorexia nervosa (only clean eating) and for awhile was criticizing me and other coworkers who consumed anything that she would not eat or drink herself--but meanwhile she would hypocritically consume those exact taboo items at restaurants. Furthermore, she treats slightly overweight female coworkers worse than other female coworkers and makes comments about having to stay skinny.\n\nSpecific Encounters:\n\n 1) Within my first few months of work, she managed to make me feel extremely unwelcome. When I was first started my job, I learned that she is originally from the state that I had just moved from (but I am not originally from the same state as she is). She took offense to fellow coworkers asking me about \"her\" state because \"she wanted to be the special one\". I ignored this behavior.\n\n2) Some time within the first three months, she and my boss were looking for a source for a job, and I offered to put them in touch with my friend. She lashed out at me by angrily saying \"I have FRIENDS in X industry TOO!\"  ...Even though it had been pretty obvious that just a few seconds before that she and my boss had been clueless on who to reach out to... She and my boss both exhibit narcissistic behavior, so she and my boss stroke each other's egos. She ended up being my boss's golden girl who can apparently do no wrong. My boss said nothing. I stayed silent.\n\n3) She has repeatedly spewed out microaggressions. She also said women and men are incapable of being friends. She would also say, \"I'm a GIRL, so I like xyz\". I found this comment to be incredibly sexist. I stayed silent and ignored this behavior.\n\n4) For a self proclaimed foodie who likes to boast about expensive restaurants, she is an incredibly picky eater and also has made slightly racist and scientifically inaccurate comments about food. Again, I stayed silent.\n\n5) For someone who likes to boast about being wealthy, she only goes to the same city every few months because her fiancee's family has house there. Meanwhile, I traveled around the world on my own dime, and she would never acknowledge my vacations. \n\n6) I brought my dog into work and hoped it would bridge the gap with her because she supposedly had a childhood dog. She called my dog smelly and never pet my dog. I am by this point convinced not only is she a narcissist but a psychopath? Eeks.\n\n7) Possibly the most hilarious. She raved about using Amazon Prime all the time for quick groceries to my boss, but in reality she borrowed my coworker's Amazon Prime account the day before because she's too cheap to pay for her own...", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I looked up the original poem by Lewis Carroll (The Walrus and The Carpenter) and realised that the Carpenter is the stereotypical overt narcissist, and the Walrus represents the more sophisticated tactics of covert narcissism. \n\nThe Carpenter complains loudly, is openly selfish and dissatisfied - basically someone you wouldn't want to be around.  The Walrus is savvier, using superficial charm and promises of affection to befriend a \u2018supply\u2019 of cute little oysters (a great metaphor for the narcs' victims). \n\nTaking advantage of their naivete, the Walrus lures them away from their home by faking care and kindness, steering them to his will (and their doom) with masterful manipulation. (I love how the poem emphasises his grandiosity, misdirection, and word salad  - the whole nine yards of a narcissistic in action). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remembered the Disney cartoon being a bit different, so I looked it up. It adds some extra elements - like the scene where the Carpenter almost scares off the prey (by essentially communicating his desires directly, a nod to the narcissists' arrogance in thinking people are too dumb to see their true intentions). The Walrus recovers the situation by doubling-down on the persuasion, lavishing attention on the little guys and promising fantastical adventures to regain the victims\u2019 trust (while simultaneously isolating them from an apprehensive and caring family member). \n\nThe oysters are so oblivious to any sinister motives that they even show gratitude to their abusers by saying \"thank you\" - right before the narcs take what they need, leaving only empty shells. \n\n(The Disney scene ends with a twist that one-ups the poem, but I don't want to spoil it in case people haven't seen it, but you can find it on youtube.) \n\nI remember that scene in the movie upset me a lot as a kid, but it\u2019s even more ominous now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sure a few people on this sub can relate.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

{"post_id": "d794wy", "created_utc": 1569064003, "title": "I feel like I can't live with myself anymore", "author": "carmensthrowaway", "self_text": "Hello, I haven't really done anything like this before and I'm not even that familiar with reddit, so I hope I'm not doing this all wrong. I just really need to vent, the guilt and shame I feel is insane and quite literally crippling. I don't know how I can continue like this. I'm not sure if someone will ever see this, but here goes; (this is also very long, I apologize. There's a lot to cover)\n\nI was brutally abused by a classmate of mine for six years, starting from age 5 to age 11. I've always been in classes with people at least a year older than me and I'm fairly certain he was held back a couple of years, because he definitely did not look like the age group my class was in and was almost as tall as most of the adults I knew at the time (not to say he was an actual adult or anything because he definitely wasn't, but still older than I was nonetheless). I feel a little silly describing the abuse as 'brutal', but that's the only way I know how to describe it, it was so violent. He could constantly drag me across the floor by my hair, spit in my face, punch, kick and shove me. He would do this regardless of whether teachers or other students were around or not, and somehow he never got any real consequences for it, sure sometimes a teacher would give him a stern 'don't do that' but there was never any serious punishment and he always continued. He called me things like 'stupid', 'useless', 'pathetic', 'pig', 'cow' and many other degrading things on a daily basis. It was horrible and very traumatizing, but I daresay I could handle it. The real brutal part of it was the sexual abuse.\n\nHe raped me for the first time when I was 8, on school grounds. When we were both supposed to be in class, he more or less dragged me into this storage room that our school had, one that no one really checks. I remember him hitting me a few times and slamming me against the wall hard enough for me to feel dizzy and a little out of it afterwards, and then told me to get undressed. I was extremely confused and didn't reply, which made him even more aggressive and led to him basically pinning me to the wall as he shoved a hand down my pants, calling me stupid and mocking me when I started trying to struggle, which was honestly useless, he could overpower me so easily. I remember trying to scream for help and when I did, he smacked me and shoved the fingers of his other hand in my mouth, telling me that  nobody was going to come to help me because nobody cared about me. He started penetrating me with his fingers and it was so painful that I started to cry and begging for him to stop and he just laughed in my face and mocked me as he continued to do it and I swear it just got more and more painful by the second. As dramatic as it sounds, I thought he was going to kill me. I didn't understand what he was doing to me but it hurt and he was hitting me so hard too, everything hurt and I was bleeding so much by the time he was finished. He forced me to give him a hand job while I was still injured and crying. Once everything was over he shoved me onto the floor like I was nothing, calling me pathetic and telling me that I better get my clothes back on. He told me that I could tell someone if I wanted, but if I did, everyone would think that it was my fault, and that I would just be admitting to everyone that I'm a whore if I told anyone. He also threatened to publicly humiliate me by telling everyone about what happened himself, and let everyone know how much of a slut I am for losing my virginity before any of my other friends. Pretty sure I didn't even know what the words 'whore' or 'slut' meant back then, but I became very familiar with those words very quickly. He used them for me all the time, along with a lot of other degrading sexual language I don't even know if I can say.\n\nAnyways, I was terrified of his threats and didn't tell any teachers, instead I just went to a nurse crying and saying my stomach hurt, refusing to let anyone touch me and freaking out whenever they did. I guess they didn't think much of it because they just sent me home for the day. I didn't tell my mom the whole story, but I did tell hesitantly tell her after several hours of her asking me what was wrong that a boy revealed his genitals to me, and that it 'scared me'. Her reaction was very underwhelming; she simply told me that boys do that all the time and that I should just ignore it. Don't ask me where she got *that* logic from, I still have some resentment towards her and her reaction to this very day, even though I know it's petty of me to do so. What happened to me that day happened the next day too, and the next and the next... He raped me so many times during my years in that school that I can't even put a number to it. I don't know why nobody noticed, he always just told me that it's because no one cared enough about me to help me, and I believed it. Sometimes, I still believe it.\n\nHe was extremely manipulative and took pretty much every opportunity to gaslight me. The next year, when I was 9, he flat out told me that he never raped me and that I was insane for accusing him of such a thing. He denied ever hitting me, too, when it was literally something he had been doing to me for years at this point. It made no sense that he would say no to doing any of this stuff, and yet, I believed him. Dissociation was a common thing for me at that point in my life and I had massive memory gaps of a lot of things, but him raping me has always been something I have remembered vividly and I was even having nightmares about it at this point, but I still forced myself to believe him because I felt like I couldn't trust myself. I truly believed I was a liar that had made it all up for most of that year, until he raped me again. It became a frequent thing again and soon enough we were back in the same routine and he even started touching me in the middle of class sometimes underneath the tables, and every time I wanted to scream to my teacher to help me, but I never did. He had started to threaten me with death at this point and I felt in so much danger already. It didn't help that around this time, I confessed to one of my cousins about some of the things he was doing and she simply said \"so you're not a virgin?\" in a really judgmental sort of way, and then said that it was sinful for me to let people touch me like that. She acted like I let it happen and although I understand now that she was young and didn't know how to deal with it either, hearing it at the same had been so crushing that I never wanted to speak about it ever again.\n\nThe abuse continued until I was 11, and we both graduated from that school and started going to separate middle schools. I wish I could say that it ended there, but it didn't. I started dating a 20-year-old guy at the age of 11, not long after escaping my first abuser. This 20-year-old groomed me with gifts and compliments, and since he wasn't beating the shit out of me like my last abuser did, I didn't consider him to be a predator. He told me things like \"I know you're young but age is just a number\" and \"The moment you turn 18, we'll get married.\" We did sexual things and I didn't care. I was in so much pain mentally, but I felt like this is what I deserved for letting myself lose my virginity so early, so I just let this older guy use me. I know this part was my fault. Even though he groomed me I willingly stayed in the relationship, but that doesn't make the experience any less fucked-up. What made it worse was that when he got 'bored' of me (he straight up told me I no longer entertained him anymore), he said that I was going to be dating his friend now. He acted like I was some kind of object that could just be passed around from friend to friend and like I didn't have a choice in the matter. His friend was an older guy too, around 19, and he was way worse in my opinion. He took photos of me and said that he would make lots of money selling them. Whenever I would show hesitance towards the idea of letting him take pictures he would get angry and scream at me, calling me an 'ugly piece of shit' and 'trash' and saying all of these awful things about my appearance until I gave in and let him, because I just could not stand the verbal abuse. I didn't tell anyone about either of these situations either. I thought no one would believe me or didn't care enough to help because that's what my previous abuser always told me, so I just got through it on my own. I got away from it all when I was 12 years old.\n\nMy mental health completely crashed around this time. I expressed suicidal thoughts, I started self-harming, I started having panic attacks, I would wake up screaming from nightmares about what happened to me, and I would slip into dissociative states where I would sit on the floor, rocking back and forth and staring at nothing and not responding to anyone for hours on end, the only thing I would really do or say would be to mutter 'no' under my breath over and over. My mother has never been the most supportive person, and would mostly just get frustrated with me whenever I did any of these things, and would sometimes slap me because of this frustration, which always just remind me of my abuser and made it worse. I tried to take my own life when I was 14 years old, by trying to stab myself. It didn't work. I survived, obviously, and started seeing a therapist shortly after that. I was diagnosed with PTSD, depression, social anxiety and, later, anorexia. The reason I mention the anorexia part is because my mom completely blew up when she found out that I was being diagnosed with that, her and my therapist got into an argument about it and she pulled me out of therapy altogether. Without therapy, I spiraled even more out of control. It was a very difficult time in my life and I didn't see how I was going to survive it, but I guess I did somehow, because I'm still here.\n\nI wish I could say I'm doing better. I'm not. I feel so dirty and disgusting because of what happened to me. I get flashbacks every day, and frequent nightmares as well. I starve myself because I want to punish myself; I hate my body, I believe it's the thing that got me raped and for that, I feel like it deserves pain and suffering. I self harm in a lot of different ways because I just can't handle how much overwhelming self-hate I feel. I don't even blame my abusers for what happened to me; I blame myself. I did everything wrong and that's why it happened to me, that's how I feel. I find myself repeating things my abusers said to me, I'm always calling myself a slut and a bitch and a whore. I've even told myself that I should start looking into prostitution because I feel like that's the only job I'm good enough for and that I will never amount to anything else but a sex toy. I feel like a used object and damaged goods every single day. I can't accept love because of it. I'm so tired. I hate being in my own body and I hate myself. I don't want to keep living with myself and I honestly don't think I can. The trauma is too much. I feel like I'll never be able to get over it. I just want it to end. My entire childhood was destroyed and now I feel like I have nothing left to go on for.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

The following weeks he would harass me, sending me lines of texts (that I still have screen shots of) I went to a coworkers house once for dinner with the people in my department and the entire time he was freaking out telling me he hoped I was getting railed, I am unfaithful, I bring out the worst in him that\u2019s why he says all these things. He would anonymously post on my (ancient) tumblr account. Once saying that I was a dirty little bitch and basically said if I ever learn to be faithful someone might want to wife me up but no one will ever want me. He also said another saying \u201cyour real mom would be so proud\u201d \nMy biological mom died last year and I haven\u2019t seen her in 9 years besides that. He knew that my mom gave me a pretty bad childhood and I confided in him these stories ya know? It was like anything I trusted him with he would hold it against me. \n\nEventually (amongst so much more) we stopped talking and he got a new girlfriend. Early last year as soon as they were done he reached out. He did the whole show and dance. We were together and he was nice but the name calling and accusations and jealousy and not being there for me all came back. He cut me out, would tell me he was talking to his ex cause her mom was dying. I voiced it was inappropriate still and wait what about my mom? (She was alive at this time) and he told me whatever your mom isn\u2019t dying. Well.. funny how that played out. \n\nOne night I wanted to leave and he didn\u2019t want me too. He grabbed me and threw me on the bed and we wrestled. I wanted to fucking leave. I went to the door and he pushed me so hard into his nightstand the pain was insane and I was about to scream and he put his hand over my mouth and told me to shut the fuck up because his parents were sleeping. I left. I said how could you just throw me like that. He said no, you fell. \n\nI woke up with a giant bruise on my hip. Bruising all over my arms. My entire body ached. The next day he kind of played it off like nothing. But he was sorry he didn\u2019t know why we fought like that he hopes I\u2019m ok. Blah. Blah. \n\nHe was in line to get his dream job as a paramedic / fireman in the town he wanted so he was going through a hefty process for it. He knew he couldn\u2019t get in trouble. And that\u2019s when he started to cut me off. I later found out that during this time he was cheating on me with that ex. There was also a message from her to him saying that he \u201chas this side to him\u201d and that one time he sent her a picture of his gun to intimidate her when they were last dating. \n\nAnyway. He was afraid of me ruining his life. He broke up with me on my birthday. I held onto the pictures of my bruising and finally told my family what happened. I was so close to filing a police report. But I didn\u2019t. I let go. \n\nFast forward months, guess who\u2019s back. We dive head into a relationship but in secret because no one that loved me would accept him back. We stayed in hotels and went on dates. I had been recently looking for my first house to buy and somehow within these months we decided to buy together. I told him I wanted him to go to therapy. He went to one session after I pleaded and of course he didn\u2019t continue. \n\nWe bought the house. Spent money. I furnished it. We had many fights when drinking and there were many days I had to put make up on bruises or wear a long sleeve shirt. He did the whole thing. Love bomb, honeymoon phase, just to do it all over again. Mix this in with me finding the messages on his computer from the year before when he was cheating on me. It was devastating. \n\nIn July he was a drunk mess one Saturday and got into a fight with me and abandoned me at my parents. My dad brought me home and my ex went to some family party. I decided I was going to go for a drive so that I didn\u2019t have to be sitting there when he came home. Of course he flipped out and claimed I was meeting up with someone. I came home he was yelling in the front yard awful things at me. At one point I called my step-mom just so someone could HEAR how he was. And she asked to talk to him and she said \u201cleave her the fuck alone. \u201c\n\nThat\u2019s the thing. He wouldn\u2019t ever leave me alone. If we were fighting he would follow me instead of walking away and calming down. He would block entrances or paths for me. \n\nThat night I saw a Snapchat from a girl on his phone and I opened it. Never heard of this girl before and saw so many messages. I was like what the fuck?! I went into the spare room to read them he followed me in and attacked me for the phone. It was a fight and he held me down and then hit my head into the bed frame and held me down by my throat. I at one point didn\u2019t know how to breathe. When I got out of the room I had a giant bruised lump on my temple and bruising on my neck. I went outside crying to smoke a cigarette he didn\u2019t even ask if I was ok. I said I think I want to call the police and he could only say please don\u2019t, you know what will happen to my job. \n\nI called. He left the scene. Spent two nights in jail. His mom called me to get some things for him. She for weeks was \u201cthere\u201d for me I guess. I was crying every day. Freaking out. On top of not knowing if he was cheating. My head was killing me. I was scared. Like I said earlier I told his mom I needed contact I needed to know if we were going to sell I needed answers I was such a mess. Also, that was my birthday week. Never fails. \n\nHe was staying every night making me dinner taking care of our dog, going on runs with me, being such a \u201cgreat guy.\u201d  One night I was upset just because of everything he\u2019d put me through for years and I said I could call the police if I wanted to right now cause you\u2019re not supposed to be here. Yeah I definitely did threaten that. But I was hurting. And I didn\u2019t end up ever making any calls. \n\nI wanted to help him come home and get over this awful thing. I fucking agreed to get him a plea deal of just battery plus probation. I did that. I fucking helped him. \n\nAfter court he went straight to his chief to get his job back. Not to the house. Not to see how I was doing after the hardest thing. I was so mad and alone I sent him so many texts saying it was bullshit and I feel used I sent him the pictures of my head from that night saying this was supposed to be about ME not him and his life and how he\u2019s doing ok. It\u2019s so messed up. \n\nI heard nothing. I came home early from work to see a moving truck in my driveway and his parents and brother packing things away. I freaked and was crying like what are you guys doing???? What is happening ???? And his mom told his brother to take his phone out to start recording me. My ex was on the phone, giving our address, a cop was there??? His mom looked at me and said \u201cthis is over.\u201d And I said wait we just went to court I\u2019ve been in so much pain why won\u2019t you hear my side of things!? And his dad said \u201cyeah we\u2019ve heard your side we have dealt with your threats for seven weeks.\u201d What the fuck?! I got your son a plea deal after he assaulted me, I allowed him to come home! \nOn top of it he had every single person that knew me through him block me on Facebook. I\u2019ll never understand that. They were acting like I was a psychopath. \n\nThat night I wanted to die. I couldn\u2019t breathe. I thought about ending it. I felt so alone and used. I felt like he just took everything from me. I couldn\u2019t even focus on myself.\n\nI begged and pleaded. I hate myself for that. He didn\u2019t want to come back. The last words he spoke in person to me were \u201cI can\u2019t let you ruin my career for the 12 months.\u201d I guess all along it was just about his job and they looked at me as a threat to that. Which is so fucked. \n\nFast forward to now. I\u2019ve gone to three therapy sessions with someone who specializes in domestic abuse and all of that. I told her I feel like an addict gone cold turkey. It\u2019s exactly how it feels. My heart rate and anxiety are so so high all the time. This week I called the mortgage company and said I wanted to refinance in my name. I\u2019m waiting on things but I\u2019m hoping I can make it work. I\u2019m nervous but they sounded hopeful. He took everything from me. My self worth, self respect, my life, my summer, my birthdays, he even took away me being a victim. He said \u201cwe\u201d were bad for each other. He talked about the time I threw a wine glass as though that\u2019s compatible to all the fucking bruises I have had. He\u2019s not going to take away my house too. \n\nHe agreed I can take the house if I can make it work which I could with a roommate. And my dads help. I\u2019m trying to accept what is. I will never understand how someone can be so awful and then abandon me on top of it. He couldn\u2019t even look me in the eye and do any of this. He had his family take care of it. \n\nI\u2019m in a lot of pain. I know this week is better than last. But does it ever stop? The anxiety? I want to feel better but I don\u2019t even know what makes me happy anymore. I isolated myself from friends and things that I loved. I feel like I\u2019m drowning above water. And you know damn well that so many people want to tell me \u201cI told you so.\u201d\n\nEverybody around me looks so normal and ok and I can barely get up in the morning. I have to think about the night he hurt me. Then being alone and hurting for weeks. Then court. Then him completely dipping out on me knowing that this would kill me. I\u2019m depressed. I feel alone. I am so terrified that it won\u2019t ever go away. I am terrified he\u2019ll always have this hold over me and that I\u2019ll never get over him. That\u2019s my worst fear. I am heartbroken. I am scared. And then I think too much and start blaming myself. \n\nIf you made it this far, thank you. I can\u2019t wait for better days.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We were, I thought, very much in love, but when I said I didn't want to live in his home town I didn't want to commute anymore, things started to get difficult.\n\nWe settled for a while, we got married, we lived in my city, but after five years of that, he decided he wanted to go back to the way things were before. A lot of people asked me if he had another family, another woman, but I couldn't see it. I had spent a lot of time in his home town, I met his family, I went on vacations with them, I met his friends. I could never figure out what was keeping him from fully being in our lives together. I moved from my tiny apartment, bought a house, figured we were family, then he just started doing the commuter thing again because, he said, \"It's best for us in the long term.\"\n\nI would cry when he left, I was so confused and hopeless, and eventually, I got sick from being so sad all the time, I had severe depression and had to stop working for a while. I was terrified because it was my work that was keeping everything afloat, and he left again, saying the best thing he could do for me was to get out of the way so I could get better, he'd come back when I got better.\n\nIt took almost a year, but when I could finally see clearly again, I realized how selfish he'd been, how he disappeared when I couldn't support him. I remain fairly confident he wasn't cheating, but I do think there's \\*something\\* in his home town feeding his need for ... I don't know what. I also think he must have sadistically liked me falling apart when he left, how my begging him to stay must have been fuel for his fire. One of the last times we talked, he was \\*still\\* angry that I hadn't said goodbye when I took him to the airport over a year ago, and he was furious with me for not initiating communication after he'd taken off.  Dude, YOU left ME. I was home all along. I remembered recently that a long time back, I got pneumonia and I was knocked out of commission for over a month. He'd tell me how much he worried, but you know, he never got a plane to come take care of me.\n\nA lot I read in this sub has me nodding my head saying, \"Oh, yeah, total covert narc.\" Other parts, I wonder. Can a job be the other woman, or family, or some other thing? Is it always a specific person that feeds the narc's endless appetite, or can work fill that gap?

I have no idea whether or not my situation was abusive and I don't want to invalidate anyone's harder or real situations. I'm also on the autism spectrum,  so its really hard to figure out the complexities here.\n\nWhen I researched this stuff in the past, there were some sources saying friendships could be abusive and the more I think about it, the more it bounces around in my head so I just have to get it out here. Again I'm sorry if I'm just being stupid.\n\nI had a group of people I no longer really consider friends and do my best to avoid, but I'm also fairly certain the cycle is starting again with someone else. Anyway,  I had pretty severe depression,  mostly manifesting as guilt as a teenager and my 'friends' took advantage of that, either knowingly or unknowingly in the beginning.  At first they'd just vent to me about their problems, which was fine. My depression put me in the mindset that I was worthless if I wasn't useful to them, so no matter how many nights I got 1-2 hours sleep talking to them, I did it. I know for a fact they were toxic, but if I didn't text back or take their side on an argument,  they'd start attacking me and threatening self harm/suicide. \n\nOne girl I'll call Summer did this the most and to such an extent I'd get panic attacks when my phone buzzed. Rose never made threats like that, but if she thought I was turning against her, she would cry (or claim to be crying) and guilt me into begging for her forgiveness. The boy Joseph was actually one of my closest friends and I still like him, but all I can think about with him is the time I fell asleep and missed his messages, so he self harmed and sent me pictures of it. \n\nI know all three of them were mentally ill, but so was I. In the years we were 'closest' I made two suicide attempts. The first time, Rose cried and made me apologise to her for upsetting her, while I was in the hospital with a drip in my arm. Summer pretty much ignored me until she needed help again. \n\nThe second time, Rose told me if I ever tried that again, we couldn't be friends anymore (I was honestly relieved at that point) and again made me apologise. Summer threatened to beat me up, made me apologise to Rose again and called my overdose 'a waste of perfectly good pills'. Then she said I'd stolen her day to attempt suicide and made me  comfort her. I hesitate to call people narcissistic or self absorbed, but her main problem with her 'best friend' trying to kill himself was the fact she would get less attention if she did it. All I remember properly is lying in the hospital and wishing I hadn't let them admit me. I was so worried about Summer I spent half of my crisis counselling session telling them about her and her name/address. I reported her as a suicide risk so naturally she flipped on me.\n\nThere's other stuff too, like making me buy them stuff because I had more money than them, but I don't know how to feel or think about this stuff. I know that even if it's a type of abuse it's not as bad as other stuff people have had to go through but I have no idea where to post this stuff. \n\nWas it abuse? Am I just overreacting? I know friends aren't as close as a partner or parent so it's not as serious but I can't even talk to my therapist about them yet. Sorry for the long read and potentially wrong sub, and thanks for reading. Sorry it's a mess, I should be asleep but I can't stop thinking about this.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

He fits the description so perfectly that it's  scary. When I realized he was a narc, everything clicked. I found myself feeling stronger, because I learned  how to better deal with his mind games and manipulation. But I'm still walking on eggshells almost everyday....\n\nOur current situation is this: We have a toddler son together. I'm a stay at home mom and a writer(though I'm not currently making an income from it, but that's the goal). My husband works full time Mon-Fri. Then Sat and Sun he spends half the day sleeping, and the other half pursuing a career in gaming. He streams on Twitch and all that jazz. Doesn't take time to spend with me or our son. Says he's  too busy working.\n\nSo basically I'm home all the time, but my sister, cousins and mom visit throughout the week which is nice. And then on the weekends I go grocery shopping and sometimes I'll take my son over to my parents house to hang out....since my husband is always too busy to spend time with us. And I get bored. And my son gets bored. So...... (Also, my husband is welcome at my parents' house, but he chooses to avoid them.)\n\nTonight when I got home from spending time with my family and son, my husband blew up at me. Starting saying I depend too much on my family and spend too much time with them and why are we even still married if all I do is spend time with my family. He then got in my face and looked me dead in the eye and told me he would f*** my dad up and break his arms and legs if he had the chance. He said he thinks about how much he wants to hurt my dad. I know he doesn't  like my dad, but to hear him say THAT.....it scared me. (I should note that this is not the first time he's threatened to hurt someone. About two months ago, he threatened to crack my skull open on the dresser....but I didn't  believe he'd  actually do it. So I stayed.)\n\nI'm very confused. Why would he be so angry that I spend time with my family? My husband doesn't put in ANY effort to spend time with me or my son....So why shouldn't I spend time with people who actually WANT to spend time with me and my son? I seriously don't get it. \n\nDoes anyone have any insight? Should I be concerned about the threats he made against my dad? \n\nThe more time I spend with this man, the more I think we won't  last much longer. I'm so worn out from the emotional abuse.

And while I would identify with so many others, I still had an issue with really accepting he was a narc. Did I really spend almost four years with someone using me? \n\n25 days into INC (initiated by me because he tried the let\u2019s be friends bullshit) I received my first hoover. Yes, I blocked and unblocked many times. I wanted to see if he still thought about me, if I meant anything to him, if he still \u201ccared.\u201d \n\nThe message simply read, \u201cHi, how are you. I\u2019ve been trying to get in contact with you.\u201d I let this message sit but then on day 31, I broke. I was mad. How dare he ask me how I am doing! The whole shabang. I told him he was asking out of guilt and he told me he had none. That was a blow. (Narcs are never in the wrong)\n\nThe funny thing is, the day he texted me was the first day I actually felt good. The weather was lovely, I was feeling positive. I didn\u2019t think I would hear from him anyway since I was aware he was with a new supply.\n\nThe message ended with me telling him that I would never his friend, but that I wished him well. I reblocked the phone number. I was a little upset at myself for that last message because of the things he did to me, but I was in a vulnerable state. \n\n[For your own sanity, do not let any contact happen. That exchange with them set me back emotionally for like 3 days.]\n\nFast forward to today. I got a new phone earlier this week. I logged into the carrier website and added his phone number to the online blocked caller list.\n\nIt\u2019s 42 days post discard and 11 days post the last contact. While I have been healing pretty lovely, today was the first day when I didn\u2019t immediately wake up and think about him and the new supply.

I was very lonely and obviously hurting. A girl that had gone to my high school messaged me through social media and asked if I wanted to start hanging out. I obviously said yes because I didn't have any friends at the time and she seemed like a nice girl. The first few months of the friendship were going great. I didn't see any issue. She was very sweet, would take me to get lunch and pay for it, buy me gifts, etc. I was honestly very happy to have a close friend like her. I opened up to her and she opened up to me. Slowly, she started telling me more and more about her past. She came from a religious family but the family fell apart after her father cheated on her mother and they divorced. Her mother became a drug addict, her dad became an alcoholic. My friend was 14 when this happened, and she was \"seeing\" a 19 year old at the time. He came from a household where he was sexually abused by both of his parents and was a cocaine addict. She started using cocaine with him at the age of 15 and also became an alcoholic. She would go to school drunk every day and eventually dropped out. To this day, I don't know if she still does cocaine but she definitely is still an alcoholic. She is a kleptomaniac, steals from stores even though she has plenty of money to spend. Even after I found all of these things out, I still continued the friendship because I was emotionally attached. I cared for her deeply and felt like I couldn't stop even if I tried. Around September 2018, I met a boy online and we started dating. He sent me a very expensive ring and she was not happy about it. She would make comments about how she \"wished a boy would give her a ring\". One day while I was at her house, I took a nap with my ring on. Woke up, freaked out because my ring was gone...and I specifically remembered having it on before I fell asleep. She took me into the bathroom and lifted up the rug, saying \"You dropped it the other day and I just left it there, I was waiting for you to notice it was gone.\" She had clearly taken the ring off my finger while I was asleep and hid it.

I would constantly break up with him and get back with him. He was also a known drug dealer at school ( carts and weed etc.) and a big pothead who struggled in school. And he was obsessed with having money and I constantly told him to stop because he would prioritize it over everything. He got suspended over possession of drugs for 3 months. I decided I would wait for him on the conditions that he never smoked or  sold drugs again because in result I would be alone and depressed at school considering I hardly had friends\u2014and if he ever did I would leave him for good, he agreed. Later on, being the emotionally unavailable guy he was, he would scream at me over the phone while I was at school for about a week, and one day pushed me over and over because I didn\u2019t give him attention. And he also did that again alter that week because I said \u201cfuck this relationship\u201d when he picked me up late from the bus stop even when I needed him there early, he proceeded to push me and I ignored him because I was going to start crying and he started telling me that I was faking it.

I break up with him and he begins for weeks cutting himself and saying it was my fault  and that I could stop it and that I was selfish. He sent me videos of him hanging himself and cuts and one arm cut with my name on it. I felt utterly numb and couldn\u2019t cope with this type of manipulation. I decided to go back with him but that same day he began being jealous again and I decided he was just not good for me. I informed my parents and his as well and we didn\u2019t talk for a month.

We began speaking again and I thought he had changed but instead he had gone back to selling and bought a gun and I was still tremendously scared of him and I had developed some sort of anxiety and now saw a therapist.

I (25F) have been wondering for the past couple of years if I was sexually abused as a child. I have this memory from when I was about 9 years old. I was over my sister's friends house, a girl about 12-13 years old. My memory is very fragmented but I remember walking to the bathroom door and seeing her sitting on the toilet, lid down and with her pants and underwear off. Next thing I remember is sitting on the bathroom floor with my pants and underwear off as well. I don't remember anything else but everytime I recall this memory, I feel intense fear and shame. I also remember this girl making me expose myself to her younger brother, who was about 7 at the time, maybe 6. I also remember being confused, as why am I showing my breasts to him when I'm only 9? I get very upset when I think about these memories, which only have resurfaced recently. \n\nI also have another memory that occured soon after, again around age 9. I'm at the hospital because it burns when I pee. I remember being in the exam room and the male doctor touching me between my legs. I remember him inserting his fingers and me crying out for my mother. I can't remember if she was in the room and if there was a nurse? IDK. I can remember the feeling of him inserting his fingers and I feel deep shame and very upset when I think about this memory too. I also underwent a VCUG at the same appointment and I remember screaming and crying during the entire procedure. \n\nSince age 9, I think I've exhibited unusually high sexual behaviors, which leads me to believe I was possibly abused. I was interested in having sex with my male friends around age 10, actually propositioning one of them. I also masturbated frequently from age 10 onwards. When I became sexually active in college, I would cry and become withdrawn after every encounter with my boyfriend, who did not force me at all. He was a really sweet guy and he was just confused as I was at the time for my intense reaction to our sexual encounters. \n\nI'm currently in therapy and even trying to talk about my past memories gets me very upset. One part of me feels like I'm making them up and the other part of me thinks, if they're true, my \"abuse\" or whatever you want to call it, wasn't that bad anyway.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I wasn't into him romantically but I did feel a strong emotional connection between us and wondered if he was romantically interested in me because he was *extremely* friendly.\n\nHe talked a lot about his life, family etc yet never mentioned that he had a girlfriend, which I realized later after viewing his online profile. I was surprised as he had been behaving in a very interested way, even flirting (complimenting me on my appearance etc.) He never made sexual remarks but I would not have been comfortable with the level of attention he was giving me if I was his girlfriend. Eventually I met her at a social event, though he introduced me to her kind of reluctantly and didn't even say she was his girlfriend, just said \"this is A.\"\n\nNot too long after this he came to class and avoided me for the whole day, and was moody and quiet. When I said goodbye at the end of class he ignored me. I messaged him and asked if he was ok, and he told me he felt very attracted to me and also felt that he couldn't \"read me\" like he normally can read people. He said he was confused by it so decided to ignore me to figure it out. I thought that was a pretty strange thing to say, and an immature way to deal with his emotions so stayed polite but kept my distance emotionally even more so after that.\n\nHe and A broke up a while later and he asked me out almost right away. It confirmed my suspicions that he had been interested when still with A, which made me feel uncomfortable. (I said no to the date.) Since then, he has continued to keep in touch and he talks A LOT about himself. He will send me messages detailing his day, how he is feeling, what he plans to do that day etc, and seems very interested in his own life. He rarely asks how I am and seems to assume that I want to know about all the details of his life which seems revealing of a self absorbed nature.\n\nSince becoming single he has shown subtle signs of being controlling towards me. We had a conversation where I told him I hate having my assignment ideas steamrolled. We got a new assignment and he asked how I planned to approach it. I told him, and he said I should do something totally different... because he liked the sound of his idea better. I was like um wtf, did you really just steam roll my idea after I told you I hate people doing that?\n\nSeveral times he made insulting remarks about a category of people that we both belong to. I let it slide, but the third time felt annoyed and said (in a semi joking tone, to gently test how he would react) that I felt insulted. He told me he was not referring to me but to himself (even though his comment was in fact a generalization about *all people* who belong to that group) and he said that I was too sensitive and that my response didn't make sense! I thought my emotional response to his comment was pretty normal, and I told him that the apparent \"nonsensical\" statement of mine only appeared that way because he completely missed my point. He backed off on messaging me for a while after that.\n\nThe latest thing he did was take a copy of my draft assignment work without asking me for permission. We had been sitting next to each other in class, and I left the room once in four hours and he chose that moment to take a copy of my work! He could have asked me for a copy, which I would have probably said yes to. I had no idea he had even done this until he messaged me and told me he had shown my work to a family member, who had made a derogatory comment about it. I was shocked that he would a) take a copy of it without permission b) show it to other people for their criticism, then c) tell me about it casually like it was something I had wanted him to do! He seemed to give no consideration to my feelings or personal boundaries at all.\n\nDo ya'll agree that these are potentially signs of a narc?

I was underage at the time and jokingly said: \"hah maybe not\" to his ideas.

I went to therapy from the time I was five until 16 and that didn't work (that is a story in itself). Anyway, I tried to cut ties with him and was successful until I was pressured for very selfish reasons to let him become part of my life again. I was told to invite him to my high school graduation, and that was the first time I had seen him in probably six years. I broke down as soon as I could be by myself.

I logged into the website to claim the one they sent me the message for, which was almost $3,000. Once I claimed it, the website told me that I had another one for about $9,000 that was already claimed. Under claimant was his name. I was with my mom at the time and we were both baffled at how he take the money from bonds that were supposed to be given to me at 18 for school (I had to pay out of pocket and rely on scholarships). I looked at the form that has to be sent in to assure that said person claiming is actually who they say they are, and the form requires: a photo of a driver's license, anything with your social security number on it, and your signature. I have NEVER been around him for him to get my driver's license. He may have something with my SSN from when I was young, but he surely didn't have my consent to sign, since I have to sign it myself. So, yeah, he committed  fraud and the bank said there is a high possibility I can't do anything about it, since he isn't the owner of my bond, but he was put as the holder (they call it custodian) of it, as I got it when I was a minor. I'm so disheartened. It's not about the money, it's about the fact that he has taken everything away from me.

When I called him out on it he shamed me for posting a picture of me that my grandma took when I went out with her that day and then accused me of have been cheating on him. Then he said I was the one gaslighting him. Then he said these people weren't invited. They showed up to the fair and hit him up, they weren't allowed at his vacation house. Then when I said I know they were there because they were posting it, he still said they weren't invited. Then said they asked to spend the night and he said no. I wake up this morning and of course find out they've spent the night. \n\n\nSeriously? The games with him. Its just blatantly out of control. It's bot even like he's cheating. He just keeps me around when theres no one else to party with and then calls me controlling when I say that treatment isn't fair. He claims I dont want him to be happy. The lack of inclusion only started when I started actually sticking up for myself with him too.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

As a child my parents almost always encouraged me to go to her house to play because there were no other children my age around, it started when I was around 6-7 and ended when I was around 10. It didn\u2019t start right away in our \u201cfriendship\u201d but when it began it never stopped. I remember seeing a movie and hearing the word \u201clesbian\u201d and of course because she was my older friend who I thought was the coolest person in the word I asked you. I still fucking hear the words \u201clet me show you\u201d in my head to this day. She would take me to her garage, and old RV, her bathroom tub, and force me to do things on her while she also did things to me. I really don\u2019t want to get into all the aspects of what was done but it\u2019s pretty easy to assume we did basically everything. She also exposed me to different kinds of porn. \n\nMy first everything was taken from me. My first kiss, my first time. Every time I\u2019ve played a game like truth or dare and I\u2019ve been asked what my first kiss was like I lie, I always make it what I\u2019ve dreamt it was, I dream it was with someone I love, when I was a lot older, and it was so wonderful I could run home and gush about it to my mom. But I can\u2019t. I cant have that and I never will. \n\nI can\u2019t tell my parents and I never will. She still lives right next door she even ended up having a kid. My stomach fucking TURNS every time I see her holding her son, even every time I see a child playing with a child that\u2019s over than them. My sense of sex has really being skewed and only know have I begun to be able to enjoy sex only with men. Although I am bisexual being intimate with women is something that I don\u2019t think I can ever do honestly the thought of it is so terrifying. \n\nI want help, I just don\u2019t really know how to get it, I don\u2019t feel like I can tell my family because I know they\u2019ll blame themselves and I can\u2019t stand that.

I also have a habit of being attracted to \"broken\" men who then become burdened by my martyrdom. I know that I do that is belittling to anyone.\n\nI can think of so many beginnings to our end, but really once I worked-up the courage to criticize him. I didn't think I was trying to be terrible, but really wanted to let him know that I didn't think he needed to continue what he did. Basically my ex is part of an underground arts community. In addition to that he knows many people who are well-known and have prestige, even outside of his circle (which he seems to have stepped back from). On our first date he told me about his apartment burning down. He sat me down and told me I had strangely \"little affect\" (we would often talk to each other like we were \"junior psychologists,\" as he put it). I told him sorry, it is our first date and I am nervous. But on a later phone call I admitted to him that I could not understand why he prefaced that story by telling me it was some girl he met at this place that hosted his totally cool artist parties who dropped a candle while in his bath -- it was the need to mention the party. It felt more like a way to brag then to convey a serious incident. I told him that I noticed he's always name-dropping or otherwise referring to the people he rubs elbows with, but that I did not think he needed to do so, that he offers so much on his own. He had very little to say, but was clearly either seething or smiling through grit teeth. We were supposed to discuss this in person, but we never directly did. On the date after that, in front of his bookshelf, he was going on about various books and he said, \"I know I know, I think I am so interesting with my varying opinions.\" I truthfully responded that I found his opinions and him interesting. But obviously he thought his doing so was some defense that I had picked up on like the prestige thing.\n\nFirst, I really let myself be used in the face of so many red flags. I have BPD and it appears that it is common for us to be attracted to those with NPD. Everything unraveled the date during which he referred to me as his gf.\n\nI can't decide what I am jealous about. During our short-relationship, he was sad over his ex of nine-years (they had ended things more than a year ago at the point I met him) yet also spoke about how he always wanted multiple women to sleep with. They had some open-relationship type of thing, except he had started it really late in their relationship with something like a one-night stand (always said he was \"greedy\") whereas she wanted a relationship in addition to the one she had with him. It's confusing and mucky. But the thing is that she seems super cool and sure of herself. Plus he loved her. She was attractive enough but she has self-composure that really makes her magnetic. But I am now also jealous of the girls he comments on online (mostly girls who aren't his type), usually IG. Those girls are often not his type anyway but I feel so forgotten. I am still hurt by all of this and he is just checking out the next thing.\n\nIt makes me feel like I had neither the character nor the appearance qualities he wanted. Before we ended it he said I was smart, funny, and attractive but that he wasn't head-over-heels so that didn't make sense. It just wasn't *me* whom he wanted. His ex was pretty influential in the art scene and again just really cool and I can't hate her. I am trying to tell myself who cares what he thinks, he is a sadistic narcissist -- but he found her worth it for the whole time we were together. He in fact admitted if she made changes and begged to come back, then I would be discarded.\n\nAlso, she had anger issues and he said it made him feel like he was a little boy again. I, on the other hand, very much needed someone to care and protect me. He would do this in some ways, but it would eventually unleash his anger. I believe that I made him feel more like the abusive father he had and is no estranged from, whereas she allowed him to feel more like the victim, which was much more comfortable to him. I think anything was better than feeling like I made him feel, like he was the raging, narcissistic, abusive father he had. I know I cannot know how he treated her and he def\n\nWhen we met, I was my ex's first sort-of real thing since his ex. He had come out of that relationship at the end of his 40's (while I am in my early-30s9) and said he was suddenly bald, had gone white, and had a paunch. I was attracted to him and though he might not be conventionally attractive, there was something about him where he's been able to get many women. But I think when he met me, whatever that was had dried up. He knows he's able to still get women by going to the parties he attends and putting on a good performance (he's been involved with stage and voice acting and it's no doubt those skills that drew me to him, in that they made me believe I was with someone I was not).\n\nOn our final meeting he told me that he thanked me for letting him see the window for a relationship was not closed. What he meant was, thank you for making me feel like I can still be desirable.\n\nHe also told me that he becomes erect when a woman cries (we engaged in BDSM and the way he tried to push me right past my limit for a wail should not be too surprising that this arouses him). When I was sad and hugging him goodbye tightly, going to my train, I felt that he was a bit erect -- was his goal to make me sad. A lot was going on, yet even after that I ran back to say goodbye to him. Even after that I told him how sad I was. Tonight will be one week in which we haven't spoken, but I still monitor him online. It is the first weekend since we met in late-July that we won't see each other. I hate that this doesn't effect him at all.\n\nI was clearly not worth the patience by our second date, yet I kept chugging on miserably with him.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I realised by this time that she was just using me for supply and I broke things off with her and didn\u2019t look back.

Constantly trying to control her and uses her for her money. Well last night I get a text from my friend about how her boyfriend broke up with her over an ultimatum he gave her. \"If you go out with your friends tonight, consider us over.\" I was not going to go out with them last night due to some issues with a past relationship that kind of turned me away from going out. But this text seemed off and I went to the bar to see her and check on her.  \n\n\nThe night was going well, we were having a few drinks, smoked and played pool. She was happy, taking selfies and generally not thinking much about her Ex. I asked her later where she was staying for the night, if she had some extra clothes and anything else she may need for a few nights away. Well my 2 other friends (W and H) offered their place for her to stay, and I offered to take her to her place to get clothes and her uniform for work.   \n\n\nFast forward to her place, we decided that bringing the group along would be a good idea. Its a Saturday night and rather late, not sure if AG is home and to be completely honest, I wasn't sure if F and I were going to be safe. So now we have 5 people there. H went home because he wasn't aware we were all going. F is already inside getting things when I pull up, and W and our other friends (J and his wife) are standing by outside. AG comes outside as i'm getting out of my car, and he decides to get a little defensive with J. I run inside after F to help her get some things and shes in hysterics. At this moment I didn't know he had taken her car keys. AG comes inside and sees me standing there asking if she needs help and he looks at me and asks me to leave so he can talk to her alone. I refuse at this point, knowing that if I leave the two alone he is going to manipulate her to stay. We get more things and she puts them in her car. This is when she turns to him and asks for her keys back. Hes refusing, telling her they need to talk, that everyone there needs to leave and that we need to get away from his house. (She \\*technically\\* pays all the rent. She pays her and her sons half, and AG's bills.) AG goes back inside and she is begging for her keys, I'm standing at the door waiting to step in if it gets worse. The next thing to happen still gives me chills, he gets really close to her face and tells her \"I hope you remember this at my Funeral.\" This sends F into a full blown panic attack, she has her keys and his keys and is trying to tell me between broken breaths that he has a gun, that he will kill himself and she needs to get the gun. She runs back inside and that's when I turn toward the street where J and W are waiting and ask for J to come over to help. I run back in after F who has stuffed the weapon in her jacket in hopes to sneak it away, but AG notices and now hes fighting with her to get it back. Some struggle later and AG has his gun back (which is in its case) and telling F that this didn't need to happen and that they need to talk. W finally comes up to the yard where F is still hyperventilating and is trying to calm her down. At this point I turn to her and explain he only said it to get a reaction out of her and that's just what he is getting. She's coming back down from her panic attack and that's when we give AG back his keys and get F into the car. W gets in the drivers seat and pulls out of the driveway with F. They take off to W and H's house and things start to calm down. AG is still upset over the calamity and J is talking him through it, explaining we are worried for F and that she will be safe. J calms him down and makes sure hes safe as well, knowing that AG has a gun in the house and tells him that that path is not worth it. AG is calm and returns back inside, somehow went from hating J to thanking him for taking care of F. J's wife is standing by in the truck and I filled her in on everything. J has to drive W's car back, so the three of us follow J to W's place.   \n\n\nWe arrive at W's place and F is finally calm. She shows me the mass of text messages from AG in his last attempt to get her to come back. She has already blocked him at this point and shes coming back to normal. We get her into a shower to help her relax more. Shes safe, away from AG. Shes seeing family today and has already called her sons father to watch her son for a little while longer while she figures out a place to stay and a child care plan for when she gets her son again.  \n\n\nI wanted to share this story because I want the community here to know that these actions are not acceptable, and that there are people out there to help. Please don't feel alone, or feel as if you're not strong enough to leave. You are loved and you are amazing.

So here it goes, I am basically wondering if what is happening in my long term relationship is abuse? So me and my girlfriend have just come up on our one year mark, something that I should be really excited for considering, I have never been in a relationship longer then a year. I have really deep rooted issues when it comes to commitment and relationships from bad past experiences, but that being said I have made a real effort to work past that the last few years. \n\nIn the start everything was great between us, we where sweet, romantic, the whole puppy love thing. It's only been the last 3 months that I have become aware that what is happening now is not normal in a relationship. I find my self being more drained and empty as the relationship goes on, and even more afraid to talk to her about it for fear of having another blow up. It seems like anything I do is just not enough for her anymore. I come home after working the same 8 hour day she mid afternoon myself mid to late evening and I am often expected to do things around the house, clean, do laundry, any running around that needs to be done, all of which I would be fine with if she did the same, but she won't. I work a \"physical job so my body is tired and sore, all you do is sit a desk all day so you should be the one doing it.\" A quote I get from her anytime I bring it up. And for a while along as I did not complain everything was fine now is just so much worst. It might be easier to list it like this. \n\n1. Constant putdowns,\" your cooking is gross you should have done this or this is how its supposed to be made\", \"you look like a troll\", bitch, cunt,dumbass. Ect\n\n2. Jokes that go just a little to far and feel like a dig, when I mention it \"you're just being a whimp it was just a joke.\"\n\n3. Anything and everything is always my fault and never hers like she can do no wrong and when she is caught in being wrong a part of it is my fault as well.\n\n4. The constant feeling of walking on eggshells because I don't know what's going to cause her to yell at me next. Knocking to loud causing her to lose a mission in a videogame, asking her to repeat herself because I didn't hear her, Not cleaning up when she hasn't in a week. \n\n5. I believe its gaslighting, where she twists my words or what actually happened to make it against me and because it's my word against hers she is always right.\n\n6. She is always telling me I am being to loud or to weird or to something whenever we go out in public. \n\n7. Most of the time she is very critical of what I wear and sometimes what I eat, (for my office job I was told not to bring junk food because I am sitting at a desk all day and need to eat health now?)\n\n8. I am always the one to cuddle her let her fall asleep, never the other way around ( I think I can count the number of times on one hand since we started dating and I had to practically beg and bargain)\n\n9. Not being able to do anything on my phone or computer for more then 10 min without her constantly pleading for attention or watching what I am doing over my shoulder\n\n10. She also has a habit of grabbing things out of my hand like my phone or a book or instructions or anything new that I have really is automatically hers for the taking whenever she pleases.\n\n11. Sex is also something that is her choice to make, any time she is in the mood we do, and if I don't want to she pushes or gets upset, turns over, and stays quiet until we fall asleep. But if I try to initiate anything its I'm tired, I work early, I don't feel well. \n\n11.5. Also during sex I am the one doing all the work, and I rarely finish as soon as she is done that's it, no reciprocation no anything kinda unfair in a lesbian relationship I think...\n\n12. Playful hitting that will sometimes end up not being so playful, no brushing or anything but it still hurts.\n\nMost of what I listed is a what happens the most often there are things that come up very rarely that I don't think are worth mentioning, but even writing that all down I think I'm understanding how messed up the situation is. An look I know I am not perfect, I could pay more attention, do more around the house, be more affectionate and supportive then I currently am. But even still I don't think what's happening is right at all.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

But the dude is in the very least a little bully who is good enough at dancing on people's nerves to make grown people cry. Today he screamed at me for about 15 minutes for making him sweep up a mess his little brother made and then threw the broom at the wall. And he screamed at me more for making him pick it up. And every single time I see him, he picks at my nerves and all my weak spots because he knows I don't have the power to punish him (well, I do now because after today my sister gave me the power to ground him). \n\nKid's made me cry almost ten times in the past year because he's so awful to me. And he's even worse to his siblings. No one listened to me about this or punished him for bullying me until today when I went to my sister crying my eyes out begging her to just DO something about it (she finally did, thankfully. He's grounded from everything for a week and again, gave me the power to ground him in the future). \n\nSome of the things he's taunted me about (he chooses his subjects and rolls with it constantly to piss me off on purpose) is the fact that I'm vegetarian (kid has waved meat in my face and continues to poke at me for not eating meat), the bad relationship between me and my dad including the physical abuse I've received, some stuff that's happened to me in the past friendships, and the list goes on and on. Just little things that irk me. And then he keeps going and adding to it. And he's actually lied to other people about shit I actually HAVEN'T done to turn my family against me.

Any advice?", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "Hi, I'm not sure what to do in this situation besides continue to collect information so it's available if anything happens in the future. Has anyone been continuously harassed by their exes in subtle ways? I don't want to keep reaching out to them to tell them to stop.\n\nHere's a general timeline of what has happened so far:\n\n* Ex came over to talk about us. We mess around and fight all night, events happen and I realize he's cheating on someone new. I confront him, we fight, and during that fight he admits he's doing it on purpose to hurt us both, and that he had already sent a bunch of nude photos of her so he was surprised I didn't know about her... I told him I had him blocked during that time. During the course of our fight he says that he loves and needs me and can't live without me. If I stop seeing him, he says he will stalk me. \n* I kick him out and he calls the cops, telling them I am threatening to self-harm, then leaves... just walks away somewhere. They arrive and I tell them the story of the night and what actually happened. They tell me to go to bed &amp; assure me they'll try to locate him for my safety and his. I don't know if they did. \n* I reached out to the girl and told her what happened. I didnt have much contact with her after that but wanted to arm her with reality... I know she talked to him but don't know what happened between them.\n* Next night, I hear noises on my porch. It sounds like someone is sitting in the chair and hanging out. I assume it's paranoia and fear and ignore it. Later my neighbor asks about it and says she wasn't sure if she should call the cops or not since she knew he'd been here before. I told her to report it so it was on file and in the future call them for this guy as he is no longer welcome and he knows it. I should add that he lives 40 minutes away and doesn't drive. So he either stuck around the area the whole day then night or took the train/bus back just to hang out there. I'm really creeped out by it either way.\n* A couple weeks later I received an email with selfies of them, and photos they clearly took of each other. It came from a fake/anonymous email. I reached out to her and told her to tell him to stop contacting me, or if it was her to please stop. I wanted it on record somewhere that I told them to stop. She talked to him and said neither of them were doing it.\n* Today from a different email address I received a naked photo of her. \n\nShould I just report this stuff? Would it be admissable in any way even though it came from a dummy account? I know the best response to him is no response, but I don't know if it's him or her sending things or what to do at this point. They are using a primary email and it would be a huge hassle in personal and professional life to change it, but if that's my final resort I will. :/", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I had never had sex before, hadn\u2019t even kissed anyone until last June, and was definitely not ready to have sex on a first date. I told him this and he pressured and pressured and pressured me, despite me saying no and pushing him away repeatedly, until I gave in. He was 23, super strong, and I was honestly terrified that he might kill me if I fought back anymore. I just wanted to go home. \n\nIt took me a few days after the assault to really accept that it was in fact assault, not just a regretful hookup. I called the police to report t, and they said that they couldn\u2019t take the report over the phone. I wasn\u2019t able to get to the station to file the report in person for another week due to my work schedule, the stations hours, and the fact that I don\u2019t drive. In the time between the assault and me reporting I wrote a very very detailed documentation of what happened, from our first communication on the app to what happened, what I said, what he said, what I touched in his house and all possible DNA that could be found, his address, what websites I visited for help, who I told, you name it I put my heart and soul into this statement. \n\nWhen I reported, they asked me what happened and I was just really nervous to say, and I have them the written statement. They said my detective would get in touch within a week and if not to call them. When I did call they weren\u2019t helpful. \n\nFinally after two weeks the detective calls me and asks me to come in for a video statement. When I go in, he never sets up a camera to record, he tells me he prefers to hear the victims spoken statements than read the written statement, yet doesn\u2019t ask me at all about what happened. He tells me it\u2019s too late to collect any evidence and that since I didn\u2019t get a rape kit at the hospital (again I was afraid and wasn\u2019t able to get to the hospital within the 72 hour period you need to), that there was basically no way that a trial would go anywhere. He asks me what I want, to get therapy, or for my rapist to go to jail. I tell him I don\u2019t know, because the whole situation just seems off and I\u2019m upset and I felt like he wanted me to just say I wanted therapy. He drives me home (I took an Uber to the station), and before I get out of the car he tells me that guys my age just want sex and I need to be more careful. I never heard from him again about it I had made a real decision, if the police had done anything, if I was doing okay, nothing. \n\nA few months ago I looked up my rapists Instagram to maybe find clues about if anything had happened. One post in particular from just a few days after he assaulted me was captioned \u201cYou say you love me, I don\u2019t know what that means\u201d, and it just pissed me off so much. I emailed my detective a screenshot of the post, as well as screenshots of all the texts between me and my rapist (which I had prepared when I originally reported but they didn\u2019t even ask for). I never got any response from my detective. \n\nThen this weekend I watched the show Unbelievable on Netflix, and it\u2019s just made me angrier and angrier about it. It reminded me so much of my case, with the male police not giving two shits about it, and then basically trying to get the victim to allow the case to drop instead of putting in the work to investigate.\n\nI\u2019m just so pissed off. I feel like a part of my life was taken away that I can never get back. I\u2019m terrified to go on dates with guys now, I was too afraid to have sex with someone who I genuinely wanted to because I didn\u2019t want to regret it, and I don\u2019t know what will happen when I finally do get into a relationship when they want to have sex. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll chicken out again or just let them because I think I have to or actually do it because I want. I\u2019m so afraid all the time and I feel so broken I don\u2019t know what to do. I just hate it.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I'm a 24 year old male, and this is my story.\n\nIt was the first week of July this year when my life started really catching up with me. I flew to another city to see my younger brother get married. My older sister was there. She's 28, 4 years and a bit older than me. I did wonder at the time why I couldn't be sober around her. Why I felt uncomfortable. Out of place. Something was there that I couldn't put my finger on. I spent the whole weekend with my two brothers there getting absolutely wasted off alcohol and marijuana  because it was the only way we could feel warm and connected to each other after everything that happened when we were children.\n\nIt was a week after I flew back when everything started hitting me. Even then I didn't remember yet. But I crashed, mentally, physically, emotionally. I felt trapped. Like somehow, an external force had decided it was the end of my life and I didn't get a say in it. I couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep. I failed an exam at university, so I put my increasingly unstable mental state down to that and booked an appointment with a  university counselor. She referred me to immediate psychological outpatient care and I saw them that day. I ended up in a psychiatric hospital for a week, the second of my now three admissions to facilities over my life. I was re-prescribed antidepressants, provided with an external safety network and released. After I was released, I started reflecting on the past events of the weeks leading up to my latest breakdown.\n\nAnd then the pictures started seeping through. Like a broken slideshow player, fragmented memories that only last 2 or 3 seconds each started playing across my mind.. almost out the blue really.. but definitely intrusive. All I know is, when I was about 8 or 9 my mum battled post natal depression before she had my second youngest brother and she spent a long of time in hospital during that new pregnancy because of that. My sister was 12 or 13 at the time. Dad made her basically the parent of us while he would be frequently at hospital or working.\n\nSomehow, we ended up playing these games. I have no idea how they started, or who started them, or what exactly even happened. I just these two particularly vivid set of memories, one where I'm up the tree with her in our little cubby house.. and she's naked from the waist up.. and she shows me how to touch her. And I remember reaching out to do as she demonstrated.. and then the memory cuts out. Nothing. Blankness. Absolutely nothing.\n\nThe next memory is shrouded in darkness too, but because it was a cold, dark, afternoon. I remember we'd build blanket forts as kids when we were sent down for afternoon rests. And the memory is similar, except I remember that it wasn't just me in the room, and at least three of us were involved in that particular memory.\n\nMy stomach drops when I write this. When I remember it. But it happens anyway so I figure there's no harm in getting it all out. When I try to access the massive blankness in my mind I get that feeling you get when you drive down a steep hill too fast. This sick, weird feeling. I find myself internally screaming at my mind. *What happened? Why am I not allowed to remember?*\n\nI've spent the last few months crying everyday, having 'body' panic attacks where I get hectic tremors without necessarily *feeling* scared. The smell is the worst thing I can remember. It wafts under my nose sometimes when I'm eating because something on Netflix as triggered a memory and then I'm vomiting into my dinner. That happened to me. It did. I can't pretend it didn't. And even though my memories are broken, I know that it went on for months. Maybe years. I don't know. It's so unfair. I was too young to say no. I didn't want that to happen to me. I wish the memories would seep out of me with the blood forever when I cut myself.\n\nThen I started remembering other stuff. I've always had issues with dissociation. With nightmares, sleepwalking, sleep paralysis. Once when I was about 10, I woke up outside in the middle of the night with the backdoor keys in my hand. Another time I woke up in front of my parents asleep in their bed. I  was plagued by shadowy figures that would approach my bed and try to strangle me as I woke up.\n\nI remember the day my mum had a miscarriage well into the first trimester of her pregnancy. She was in the shower. And she started screaming. And we all ran into the bathroom and she told us not to come in. The door was already half open. There was blood all over the shower floor. I don't remember much between then and when we buried my would-be sibling in a cardboard box in our front yard. I was maybe 11 at the oldest. I remember my parents being absolutely distraught. But I didn't feel anything. I wasn't there. I was out of my body, floating up behind my left shoulder, watching everything through a hazy tunnel of vision.\n\nI remember the day me and my twin brother and older brother were in the bath together. We can't have been more than 5 years old and he wouldn't have been more than 7 years old. I don't know what my older brother did. I think he squished soap down the drain. But dad pulled him out the bath and bent him over in front of us and belted him so hard that his entire backside was covered in blood. That was dad on a good day. Sometimes he did it with warning, sometimes there was no warning. Sometimes he'd tell you how much you were going to get and how hard it would be, other times he just went crazy. Dad got stressed. He'd react outwardly. And he had a temper he couldn't handle. And somehow when I was younger, I remember being taught or thinking that was an honourable thing. Dad is always right, so don't piss him off otherwise he'll give you a good reason not to sit down for a week.\n\nSometimes if he was punishing one of my siblings, he'd make us hold their legs and arms down so he could belt them until they were trembling from crying so much. He did it to me and my brother too. We learned to look out for each other. Put aloe vera on the cane marks so the welts weren't as painful. Hug each other because we knew that even in our biggest quarrels, we didn't deserve that. I never remembered what I did but the more I remember, the more convinced I am that I have done something completely unforgivable in a past life and now I have to pay for it. I have to suffer for the order of the universe to remain in balance. I remember the days when he'd set a time for the whole house to be clean and if I didn't do it on time he'd send me to bed without any dinner. If we were lucky, we got bread and water.\n\nThere are so many occasions where I remember going to bed lonely, cold, and hungry, wondering what I did to my father to make him hate me so much. Especially when there are things he did that actually made me bond with him, to want to share his interests and make him proud.\n\nA lot of the memories are still fragmented and broken, possibly due to excessive marijuana use in the past. But after seeing that many psychologists, psychiatrists, and other mental health professionals over the last four months, I'm slowly coming to terms with the fact that I witnessed and experienced multiple forms of trauma co-existing at he same time and lasting for months, and years.\n\nMy first psychiatric admission was 5 years ago. I was diagnosed with Panic Disorder with agoraphobia and dysthymic tendencies. I did exposure therapy. I  did CBT. I did transcranial magnetic stimulation. I took antidepressants and anti-psychotics for a year. For a while, I recovered. And now I'm back to square one again, wasting more time I could be spending on thriving at university and life, instead of re-piecing this miserable fucking existence that was given to me. \n\nI'm currently seeing a trauma therapist for C-PTSD and the work we've done so far has been helpful. But some days I feel so fucking lonely. So empty. I can't hide anymore. I can't pretend it wasn't abuse. Or that it only happens to other people. Or that it didn't affect me. Or that it wasn't as bad as others.  I have too much pain inside me. I have too much damage. I push people away because I either don't trust them, or think that if they saw the real me they'd be disgusted or overwhelmed and they would probably despise me. They'll never be able to relate to me, or understand me. I feel so bloody cripplingly alone and trapped in this world. I feel like I'll always be alone. Me against the world. I struggle to eat well or look after myself because it's like there's another person inside me who's convinced I don't deserve nice things. I feel like I'm fighting a war with my mind all the time, with everything. With self care, with socializing, with everyday interactions. I don't recognize my face in the mirror. Who am I? What am I? Everything seems so pointless. Memories keep coming back over time, right, that's how trauma works. I'm going to have to deal with this for years and years. It's got to the point now where I wake up everyday and just say, \"Not today. Today I will stay alive\".. But I don't know how much longer I can go like that.

My mind just instantly reminded itself of how badly things went when I really opened up to another person. This sucks. I want to be able to tell what's normal or not again.

Please ignore any of my contact as I am the worst.\n\nIf only there was a world where I wasn't such a piece of shit and we could just cuddle and be in love\"\n\nLater that day I see he also sent me an e-mail at 2:37am saying: \n\n\"I really wish I could go back and accept all your love\"\n\nI know I'm still under his control. I KNOW I should block his alt account he has now decided to hoover me on, and his e-mail address since those are the only two ways he can reach me now as far as I know. I haven't and wont respond to him because I am in a place now where I have far more to lose than to gain from giving in.\n\nIt's sad because this is the strongest attempt at future-faking he has ever done. His usual attempts in the past have always been more of hint that we \"would could be a good pair if....\" or something not as direct as using the word LOVE but wanting for us to be together.\n\nI assume the hoover has gotten this strong because I've finally stopped allowing myself to give him chances, answer any contact attempts, and the belief that \"this time he understands that I truly love him and he loves me and he'll give me the love I've asked for over and over again\" is untrue and purely a tactic as well as promising me \"I want things to be different this time\" and then almost immediately withholding affection. He must know it doesn't work anymore so he's going full throttle. Plus he knows I'm seeing someone and maybe he realizes thats probably the biggest reason I have more strength than any other times.\n\nIt's funny cause in his e-mail I assume he is trying to make me feel like he regrets how things have went down through our relationship, and that he really wishes he could go back and fix things, but to me I see him acknowledging that he did in fact know and purposefully withheld love during my attempts to work on our relationship each time he cycled back.\n\nAlso take not of the time - Always 1am or later after a Saturday night.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Jealousy and cruelty, mean words with never actually expressing remorse for what you did, simply making excuses for your actions, blaming someone or something else. Or even blaming me. The physical abuse was just the same. You would discard me as soon as I fought back or called you out on these terrible acts of abuse. My heart ached and though I begged and pleaded for your empathy, your apology, something to change within you and see that I was a person with a soul and heart that you were hurting. You moved on so fast and expressed yourself again that way, idolizing a different person and claiming them as your soulmate with all these life goals. And you did the same to them. Turning sour so quickly, filled with threats and empty promises, just to leave when it starting falling apart. You came back to me and flooded my mind and life with this \u201clove\u201d that hooked me and made me believe that yes, we are supposed to be. You moved quickly with me, moved in with me, buying a house, making the life everything you were trying to have... but for yourself. I think I could have been anyone. When you physically assaulted me, you no longer needed me because I displayed your true colors to the world and that made you switch from a \u201cloving\u201d person to someone who cannot face their own mistakes and someone who cannot take accountability. You never really said sorry for what you did. To top it all off, you left without having even a conversation with me.

I feel like my parents meant well. This post is just highlighting the bad parts, and trying to put a label on it (if I can).\n\nContext:\n\n* Dad's family had physical abuse, alcoholism, poverty.\n* Mom's family was well-off but had weird moments: stories of domestic violence in the past. A stepdad who lost his legs in a traumatic chainsaw accident (though he may have had BIID?)\n* Mom was bullied in school, then married before she finished college. Her dream was to homeschool kids on a self-sufficient farm, and have said kids finish college.\n\nRed flags:\n\n* As a kid I was an abnormally picky eater, often light-headed at school from barely eating. I had horrible motion sickness and reportedly puked after being driven to school every day. This was just dismissed, despite a teacher's concern. No doctors or treatment. I think it's related to autism, but I struggle now with a fixation on reliving that experience, almost to the point of bulimia.\n\n* Was taken out of school and moved to a home farther from the city. I was an only child, my dad worked, and all other family lived far away, so it was just me and mom, alone together all day. I was started and stopped on various curriculums. Because of social anxiety and a revolving door of honeschool social groups I was very isolated. However, because I was \"gifted\", I managed to fake my way through standardized state tests.\n\n* I made a couple of close friends when our moms befriended each other. But both times some unseen event stopped us from seeing each other, involving my mom being screamed at. I don't think those moms liked the way my mom raised me.\n\n* I developed really bad OCD, dread, a feeling of unreality (disassociation) and of monsters hunting me. I begged my mom for help. One day she snapped and sent me to my room for the rest of the day. I was crying at the door to be let out (I was too obedient to open the unlocked door). I heard her crying and I guess she drowned out the sound of my voice with a vacuum cleaner.\n\n* That night, I was given the \"7 Habits for Highly Effective Teens\" book and told I needed to snap out of it and start behaving. (Keep in mind my mom had had meds and therapy herself, so she must have been somewhat mental health savvy.)\n\n* Some years later, I convinced my parents to help me find a therapist. They had discouraged me because my mom had had bad experiences with them. It took imaginary conversations with a made-up friend (keep in mind I was in my mid-late teens) to convince myself I needed to get some help.\n\n* A couple times a year or so, my mom would basically have an angry meltdown (likely on the spectrum as well). She'd break objects like glass bowls, kicked a hole in the wall and a crack in the door, screamed curse words, and cry because she \"felt trapped\" in this way of life. Just hearing her start to sound sad or angry makes me feel like my muscles are melting and I can't move.\n\n* In college (which I started early, and finished 9 years of while still living with parents), I finally broke myself, and went to a hospital to be put on suicide watch. I was given a typed up ultimatum, basically reminding me how much money my living there was costing them (while still in college, because my mom insisted I finish because she never did). My dad was mad that I told the social worker there were guns in the home. My mom posted a meme on Facebook about how nice it was to cut toxic people out of her life. I stayed the night at a hotel (maybe a dumb move, but I was a mental wreck) and for a while after she refused to speak to me or let me near her.\n\n* Another time my parents got a warning from my therapist that I wasn't doing well. My mom took all photos of me off the walls. In her defense she was recovering from cancer.\n\n* Now that I'm an adult, my mom has cut ties with her own mother, but requests I don't do the same to her.\n\n* They've kind of straddled the line between pet rescuing and hoarding. First we had 10 pets (mostly cats and small caged rodents) in a condo. Then up to 4 dogs at a time in a house. Lately many dogs are hospice fosters. But there's so much urine stain on the floor.\n\n* At one point they convinced me to let them sell my favorite dog, on the condition we could move back to the city. They did not follow through. I still hate myself for betraying my dog. But they couldn't stand his obsessive barking, my dad would tackle him, once they tried a shock collar, a memory I blocked out.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

Her mother abused her, her father abandoned her, her soon to he ex husband abused and manipulated her, herex lover left her after 2 miscarriages and ghosted her. Her highschool flame rejected her. Shes had it rough too.\n\nI fell for her too hard too fast. I am not clingy, before my wife cheated, I had no jealousy issues and I had no insecurities. I do really bad now. I seen us as being committed because it felt so familiar to me and my marriage. She had multiple partners. \n\nIt really messed me up. I would watch where she was on snapchat. I asked who she was with. If she was in other dates. I went crazy. She even said she was afraid of my jealousy.\n\nI tried to cut it off because I knew it was fucking with me. She felt I was abandoning her. I then told her I loved her and I wanted to be with her.. because I truly did.. however we had a rule that no feelings allowed.. and she said if they show up she will run. I was a fool.. she said she had feelings for me too.. but I already bailed on her and it was too late. I back pedaled. She told me to prove it.. and to give her some time and space. I told her I would wait for her to message me. \n\nThat night I seen she was at a casino. I messaged her. I told her I needed to see her and prove to her I care. She responded I'm not ready to see you yet. I'll just want to smack you. I'm too drunk to deal with this and I'm leaving right now. I panicked I seriously thought she was going to drive home drunk.

I seriously thought she was drunk.. she never drinks. I should of listened.\n\nI got to where she was.. same casino but in the other end. I texted her and said I'm here at valet. Do you want to come to me or should I come in?\n\nShe came to me. \n\nShe was very upset. Said I overstepped majorly. She said I had no regards for her feelings and I was being abusive and manipulative. I've never been called that in my life. I then realized that I triggered her. I felt terrible. I took her ass chewing like a man. I never threatened, motioned, attacked. I never even stood up. I apologized and told her I'm leaving. I texted her and said I will not message you until you message me. Its been 2 days. We have talked everyday all day for 3 months.\n\nI don't want to see her again if she's scared. I do feel very compelled to explain myself and give a sincere apology. I hate that she probably seen me as being crazy.. and to be fair I was being crazy. I was not being me.. my soon to be ex wife would never beleive I acted that way. I cant be with her anymore because it will cause me to do this. So I will not continue seeing her like this. I have to get emotionally stable first. I know this now.\n\nI'm not sure she will ever message me... and that's okay.. but I really want to explain myself and my actions.

The last two years on/off with him.. making me feel shittier than I ever have in my life. He has likely ruined me for life. I'll never trust again. Never fully give myself again. I hate him for that. It's helped me keep the 40 days NC so far... longest we've ever gone.

I'm glad I'm still so damn mad, it keeps me from trying to repair anything with him and I'm certain if he messaged me tomorrow or showed up on my door, I'd tell him to go fuck himself. That's a good thing, right? Madness, not sadness?\n\nThere's just one problem.... I still CANNOT stop looking at his WhatsAPP to see when he's talking to \"her\", with her, whatever... I still check his Tinder (we're still matched from last year...) to see if he's still active... he is.

I guess I'm scared that if I stop looking, I'll not know for sure if he's still with \"her\" (which keeps me mad), and I'll feel sadness instead of madness because I'll miss him and blahhh.... it's messed up.

She was respectful of my boundaries but also made me feel like sex was a way to make her happy, and because she was depressed, I would do basically anything to keep her feeling okay. She came over and the plan was to make out but when she started to kiss me and touch me I became incredibly uncomfortable and would have to stop every now and then to dry heave. I think this is more due to coercion, but I also question myself too because I made the choice to invite her over. She kept asking me if I was okay and I would say I was fine even though I was visibly uncomfortable and kind of crying/gagging. Afterwards I felt like I was going to throw up for hours and was incredibly anxious. I definitely think she took advantage of me but I don\u2019t know if it qualifies as sexual assault (I wouldn\u2019t ever pursue legal action, I\u2019m just trying to sort this out in my head).\nThe second instance is much more clear-cut, it was months after we had broken up and she told me she was horny and wanted me to come over. I complied because she was still manipulating me, and making me responsible for her emotional well-being. We were watching Rent when she got on top of me and before I could say anything I was pinned down against the couch by her weight and I couldn\u2019t see anything, only feel her violently kissing me and holding my arms down. I was kind of afraid of her at this point because I didn\u2019t want her to hurt herself or me so I let her kiss my neck and undress me and do other things I wasn\u2019t comfortable with. I wasn\u2019t an active participant in this instance, as she was pinning me down with her weight and doing things to me. I don\u2019t remember how this incident ended and I honestly believe it\u2019s because it was very traumatic and I don\u2019t want to remember.\nPlease give me feedback, if these sound like instances of sexual assault.

Sorry if this is jumbled or doesn\u2019t make sense, I\u2019m still trying to work out what happened to me.\n\nEDIT: an important note about the first story is that she told me after the incident that she knew she probably should have stopped because of how uncomfortable I was, but continued anyways.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

When I was 15 I began a relationship with D who was 18 at the time. I was worried about the age gap but everyone seemed supportive so I decided to go for it. Things were pretty nice at first but he seemed to grow tired of me pretty quickly. I had a pretty wide variety of personal problems at the time (recently dead brother, poor family, alcoholic father, constantly fighting parents, truly this is only the half of it) in addition to anxiety and depression only worsened by everything I had going on. D seemed pretty supportive at first and was usually there for me until I guess I got to be too much.\n\nTo give him the benefit of the doubt here, I was 15 and in my very first \"real\" relationship and was pretty much looking for anyone who would pay attention to me. My two best friends were dealing with stuff of their own (one had just suffered the loss of his mother and the other had moved to a different state) and my parents were pretty absorbed in themselves and their issues. In hindsight I was probably a little clingy and unreasonable sometimes and he often complained that I was being immature. If I texted he would take all day to respond, complain that I wanted to spend time with him like, once a week, claim I was picking fights if I said I had an issue in our relationship, etc....\n\nI guess this may all sound like teen drama and looking back some of the issues could totally be attributed to us being young and not knowing how to handle things but a few things really stood out to me, even now: (here is where the trigger warnings come in)\n\n* I have a pretty bad habit of misplacing things, mostly just setting things down and then forgetting where I left them. I've never truly lost anything and never really had to spend more than 5 minutes tops looking for it. One night we were hanging out on the couch and I was looking at something on his phone. I got up to go grab something and when I came back just a second later I'd misplaced his phone somewhere. He was so angry and I kept apologizing. He said I had lost it on purpose and ended up pushing me off of the couch in an attempt to look for it.\n* One night he was dropping me off at my house and after we'd pulled up in the driveway he asked if I would go down on him. I told him no and that I'd stated several times in the past that it wasn't something I wasn't comfortable doing at that point in our relationship. He asked again and said that he just wanted to see how it felt and that I would only have to do it one time, etc. I still told him no. He kept asking a few more times until I eventually gave in because I was scared and worried that he wouldn't think I was cool enough or that I was too immature and would leave me. Afterwords he mentioned that I did a bad job anyway. \n* Closer to the end of our relationship, I was feeling very suicidal and afraid. I was all alone in the house and had called to ask if I could tag along with him for the day just so I wasn't by myself. He told me no and that he was too busy. I stayed at home all day by myself, hurt and afraid. Later that day I was looking on social media and had seen a post where he was just out with a couple friends, all people who I knew and liked hanging out with. This greatly upset me so I asked him about it. He said that he didn't want to bring me because it would be too embarrassing and he knew I would cry and that he didn't want to deal with me. This is in reference to other times he'd taken me to hang out with his friends and none of them would talk to me. He and his friends would just wander off and leave me and I would get upset and start to cry.\n* One time I was having a very hard night, feeling very overwhelmed and stressed out. I texted him and asked if we could just talk for a little bit to help me feel better and calm down. He said that he was busy playing video games with a friend online and that he would talk to me in an hour or so. An hour passed and I never heard from him. I waited all night and heard nothing until the next morning when I got a pretty lame apology. Similar events happened somewhat frequently but this is the one I remember the most..\n\nI have since come out as a lesbian and my girlfriend and a few friends insist that this was abuse and sexual assault but I feel that it isn't and that I'm blowing things out of proportion. Some days I feel confident that he hurt me and that the way D treated me wasn't right but most days I feel as though I deserved it for always pestering him, asking him to hang out all the time, texting him too often, and being so embarrassing and crying all the time when we went out. \n\nAfter we broke up I would actively avoid certain parts of town for fear of seeing him. I would have panic attacks and cry if we went near his house or places he hung out. While most of the fear of running into him has subsided, I'm still deathly afraid of him. I saw him about a year ago at a local event. He just walked past me, didn't look at me or say hello or anything, just walked past me and I had a panic attack and had to go home. \n\nThis causes some issues in my current relationship too as I often worry that I'm an embarrassment or an annoyance. There have also been times where I've had sort of flashbacks. One night my girlfriend and I were sitting in her car and I froze up and started to cry because I just so vividly remember D pestering me to go down on him. It was so scary and I wouldn't let anyone touch me for a while after....that isn't the only time something like that has happened but I'll spare the details since this post is already so long.\n\nBasically I guess I'm just looking for some sort of advice on how to cope or just get over with whatever it was that happened. Was I actually abused or am I just blowing everything out of proportion? \n\nTL:DR - Several years ago I was in a relationship that I worry might've been abusive due to remarks about me being an embarrassment, him pestering me for sex acts until I gave in, pushing me, etc and that I may have been taken advantage of due to being younger than him and in a poor emotional state at the time. It's causing a few issues in my current relationship even though it's several years after the fact.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Ultimately the other girlfriend stayed with him and I\u2019ve had zero contact for about 13 months. He\u2019s blocked on everything and was immediately after I left, and the other woman at the time blocked me even though when we first spoke the depth of lies and secrets was staggering and she knew everything he\u2019d done to both of us. \n\nI\u2019ve been working hard at healing, got a really great new job offer, and moved across the country without a word. He and I had lived in different cities so there was no merging of things or friendships, so I got to leave with no ties. I\u2019d finally gotten to a place of feeling okay. \n\nTonight I got a random message from a stranger on FB saying this might be weird but... and that was all I could see. I am part of several travel groups and occasionally get a question about where a certain picture was taken, etc, so I just asked if I could help not thinking much of it. And then my phone rings. It\u2019s a woman I\u2019ve never heard of. She\u2019s been dating him for several months, she\u2019s been cheated on before by a husband, and the Nex stories and timeline of his past weren\u2019t adding up. He gave her my first and last name several months back so she could look something up about me (WTF ?!?) and she admitted she\u2019s been all over my social media trying to make the pieces fit. He also conveniently left out the fact that the \u201cbest friend\u201d (who apparently is still around and they \u201chave a past\u201d and he won\u2019t introduce the new person to her but he\u2019s not attracted and they are just friends) and the lies were why we broke up. \n\nBut she claims he keeps saying how he regrets what he did to me deeply and he tells her over and over that me cutting myself off and my friends doing the same has been such a burden on him. She wanted to talk and ask me some things, and seemed sincere so I talked for a while. But now my gut feels so weird. Is there a such thing as a Hoover by a flying monkey? She swore up, down and sidewise that she was not going to reveal we talked and I kept the conversation to facts as much as possible, but she asked some questions that felt a little odd (in the guise on she\u2019s been in an abusive relationship before, all men are going to hurt you anyways, and what was my reason for staying aka what good did I get out of the relationship). I get the sense she may stay with him anyways because, well the devil you know and such. \n\nAnd at the end I heard a weird clicking and now am paranoid I was being recorded. It is like I\u2019m back a full year to being anxious and feeling 1000% vulnerable. All my social media is private but she\u2019s somehow combed through the pictures. She\u2019s confirmed he wants to travel to all the foreign countries we went to together. Did I totally screw up by trying to be helpful? I should have just said this is no longer my life or business and left it at that.

She said I was an embarrassment, that she\u2019d never ever get back together with me now because I\u2019m an 18 year old college student on an app meant for high schoolers. She yelled at me for moving on slightly and doing good without her a whole 1 month after we broke up over me lip syncing a song on an app. She talked shit to my best friend and everyone that I knew basically clowning me all because she was mad I was doing okay.\n\nI broke up with her because she had absolutely no sympathy for my feelings, could yell at me all day for doing something slightly wrong  but cry and doesn\u2019t say anything when someone does something a lot worse. I\u2019ve been told I fucking hate you, I\u2019ve been told I wish I never met you, I\u2019ve been told that I\u2019ll never find someone who will love me as much as her just so I can be trapped in the bullshit she put me through. We\u2019ve broken up maybe 14 times by her saying she\u2019s done all for her to come back the next day apologizing and begging me to come back when she told me to block her/delete her number the day before. \n\nEveryday had ups then by the end of the day it would always end on a downward spiral she would start. Everyday had an argument, it was always her insulting me and going against me instead of teaming up to fix our issue. I\u2019ve been told so many times that she would change all for her to do the same abusive shit she\u2019s always done.  Now I get change doesn\u2019t happen in a snap, I told her steps towards it mean a lot more than nothing and change just never happened at all not even a little bit. \n\nThere\u2019s times where I\u2019d mess up and I\u2019d profusely apologize all for her to say it\u2019s not a real sorry and that I should do more to show her that I\u2019m truly sorry. There\u2019s times where I\u2019d sit on her bed crying all for her to say \u201cwhy the fuck are you crying now? Stop being a fucking baby\u201d. I don\u2019t cry often, it takes a lot to make me cry but she\u2019d always stack up horrible things to say or do and then act like it\u2019s normal.  \n\nI\u2019ve lost my self worth, I\u2019ve lost the bar of where I should draw the line for myself, I\u2019ve lost a lot of shit just by taking this battle day in and day out. For 6 months I\u2019d pretend the relationship is going all great to the public eye when in reality it was 20% good and 80% awful.  \n\nI posted a paragraph on my Private Instagram account to close friends about how much shit she put me through because she made it seem like I was such an awful person. Then she shows up at my house  uninvited crying after she went off on me hours before talking so much shit. She was there telling me how she loves me so much, how I\u2019m an awful person for moving on, how she doesn\u2019t know me anymore, how I\u2019m such an awful person for speaking out about what she\u2019s done to me to my close friends. She made me feel so guilty for feeling how I did over the stuff she put me through. \nI was so devastated, it felt like all I had was guilt because maybe I shouldn\u2019t have told everyone but I couldn\u2019t take it constantly hearing her remind me that people think I\u2019m an insecure piece of shit who didn\u2019t care about our relationship for going on an app to lip sync songs.\n\nI found something to occupy my time besides school and the gym all for this person to try to make my life worse for doing better. \nI sit here and wonder what if I had done things better in our relationship, I wonder if she had just changed like I begged her to in the first month that we would still be together. I wonder all the time because it\u2019s a fresh bruise but knowing how narcissists are, they will mostly likely never change.

My partner and I have talked about this before and how she believes that she is abusive towards me, I don't agree. Although I'm not just making this post to reassure her, also to reassure myself and see how we can improve our relationship.\n\nMy partner will be doing OK until something stresses her and tips her over the edge. Like yesterday, when the delivery didn't arrive, she broke down, started crying and hitting herself. Threw her glasses in my general direction (I'm pretty sure she just threw them and they happened to hit me). The other time a calculator went flying at a wall and she cried because she could have hit me with that and didnt think about the fact that I was sitting in the same general direction. She will occasionally tell me to fuck off and generally struggles with impulsivity. She will just go to squeeze or sometimes bite  whatever is in close proximity of her and very occasionally it will be me, she usually stops herself. She'll often tell me to leave because she's worried she may hurt me. \n\nShe's obviously very apologetic, we're trying to sort things out. She's been doing rough since she came off the pill but can't go on it again due to high blood pressure she has counselling and is taking other medication to see if it helps.\n\nShe says I only put up with her because I have been abused and think it's OK. Like I mentioned, my mother is abusive. She will constantly yell at people, act like everything is their fault, I have been hit, I've had a book hurled directly at me, I've been kicked. What I'm mostly saying is, I've been sought out as the target.\n\nI feel like I've just said the bad points about my partner, she's very understanding, she helps me, we talk a lot, we try to improve ourselves, we try to put the others needs as a very high priority, we ask if things are OK, we check in, we talk a lot.\n\nI'd sty it's very loving and would be totally OK if she wasn't doing so rough right now.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Im so scared about the possible things that could go wrong. What if he Doesn't leave like planned that day and the entire plan is ripped to shreds? What if he comes home hourssss earlier than he should, like he did today?\nAnyone else dealt with moving out from living with a Narc boyfriend? How did you get through the anixety?\n\nHe does give me unknowingly pushes for it. Everytime hes rude, get mad, treats me like shit or tries to manipulate me, im using it as support for my reason to leave. I have to keep reminding myself im Not being overdramatic!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Poor him had such bad luck with all these mean crazy women #pity #pity #pity. I always knew this was bull and have repeatedly asked \"Why was she crazy?\" and never really get a solid answer. For one example (NEX is a landlord) his ex was crazy because she broke all the screens in the house by taking them in an out to climb on the roof to smoke cigarettes. That doesn't sound crazy to me, just careless with the ex boyfriends property.. but whatever.\n\nSo on to me.. as I mentioned, NEX is a landlord... unfortunately he is my landlord \\[SEE DETAILS BELOW PLEASE\\] so I still have to deal with him and be cordial about it.\n\nThe problem has been that any niceness has been interpreted as me falling back in line. If I say good morning walking to my car (he has a garage here for property management tools etc, but he does NOT live on the property) then he will start texting me to try to draw me into a conversation. I cut this off by either ignoring messages or by sending a 'Look we're done stop asking if I want to go to XYZ' to which he acts like I'm freaking out on him... This cycle has repeated many times as I've had to have him turn on my heat for the season, and check smoke detectors, he needed me to move my car a couple times to work on the driveway etc. Basically I cant live here and cut him off completely, that's the cost of not moving.\n\nNow he acts like any time I tell him to leave me alone that I'm having an anxiety attack. I shut the door in his face once and it was me \"freaking out\" when really I was just calmly ending a conversation (once he starts harping on something its like a 3 hour conversation....). He keeps asking me if I'm seeing someone for anxiety meds, and I tell him its not anxiety its YOU, to which he rolls his eyes and acts exasperated (shut the door in his face for that one). Its just any time I say \"Look I'm not talking to you about this, I want you to leave me alone\" then he acts like I'm freaking out and need help which causes him to reach out more to \"check\" on me. When really I'm just like \"STOP, I'm done. I don't want to be in a relationship anymore.\"\n\nIts like he knows it irritates me so hes poke poke poking until it because a self fulfilling prophesy. Because him accusing me of being crazy is driving me CRAZY!\n\nI'm sorry this inst a well formatted question.. just has anyone dealt with this before? Is there some advice you can give me. I know I'm not crazy, really I just have a hard time setting and enforcing boundaries and I get exasperated when I have to reaffirm them constantly.\n\nOn the bright side this Narc has been one of my greatest teachers because I am not fleeing from him. Instead he is forcing me to build endurance to his tactics. Hes also shown me some red flags to look out for when dating others. So while this experience is\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*HOUSING DETAILS - I didn't want to derail the above post.*\n\n* Yes I did know the risk when I moved into the place. We actually discussed the what if we broke up scenario before moving in and he said he would be OK just being a landlord should that happen and we can both act like adults.... OK take a moment to laugh here... still going? I'll wait.... OK done? Moving on..\n* Yes I do have a lease and know my rights as a renter which are pretty solid in this state.\n* Yes I could try to move early, however he could then attempt to sue for breaking the lease and or keep my deposit which would then bring us to small claims court etc.\n* Yes when I do move I will have other people here to discourage an outburst.\n* **Yes I do have security cameras**. A ring on my door, and motion cameras upstairs and down. I'm pretty secure as he has shown legitimate fear of cameras in other tenant housing so I know he does not want to be recorded doing anything he shouldn't. In short he fears my knowledge of technology.\n* Yes also have mace in several places around my house, not specifically for him but because I am a single woman. Previously I was in a more 'city' area.\n* No I am not in danger. He wont bust through the door and try to murder me. This is just tiring and hes trying to wear me down and get me back into his narc supply.\n* No I cant totally cut him off because if he decides to be a dick and not plow my driveway, I cant get to work. No plowing is not in the lease and my car is only front wheel drive. The snow plowing is actually his biggest leverage over me because of my not north friendly car so I need to keep him on friendly terms until Winterfell thaws in spring. But then he does have to show my apartment towards the end of my lease...\n* This all ends next July, I've only been here a couple months so I just paid the first, last and security plus the cost of people to move me.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

The behavior usually concerns such minor things that I feel silly even getting worked up about it - it's more that he will either totally deny my version of events, or say something along the lines of \"I didn't mean it that way\" even if he does apologize. \n\nHere's an example of a recent conversation we had about a family dinner we had planned. The dinner was about 30 minutes away from where we live: \n\nH: Hey, we have that dinner tonight, what time should we tell them to start? \n\nMe: 6 pm works for me.\n\nH: You sure?  You don't need it to be later? (I've been working late, so this is sweet right?)\n\nMe: Yes, 6 is good. I have to be up early tomorrow so I'd rather not be out late. \n\nH: Ok I'll tell them.\n\n\\[10 minutes later\\]\n\nH: Ok I told them 7.\n\nMe: Why? \n\nH: Because I know you've been working late.\n\nMe: But I told you 6? \n\nH: I was trying to be nice. \n\nI asked him to tell them 6 would work better. This turned into a fight later that night. I was told that I got annoyed at him for no reason because he was trying to be considerate in setting the time for later. I got frustrated because I don't feel it's considerate to just ignore my request. \n\nThis is one small example. Sometimes these interactions are over bigger issues, but most of the time it's about small stuff. Like I said, my husband is widely known as a caring and sweet human. This stuff makes me feel like I'm crazy, because none of it seems malicious. And it's such freaking minor stuff. Why am I making such a big deal of this? If he'd made a mistake about the time, that would be one thing - but he knew I said 6 and told our family a different time anyways. In the past, I would have just rolled my eyes and went at 7, because he was trying to be nice right? But recently I've been pushing back at this kind of stuff - because how is it nice to completely override what someone explicitly tells you is their preference? And when I push back, I've noticed it turns into a huge fight, and then I get accused of being a jerk.\n\nMaybe my standards are too high and I'm overreacting. I think I just need to hear another human being chime in as to whether I'm blowing this out of proportion or if this kind of behavior really is inappropriate.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I've been crying a lot, visibly lost weight and i am very lethargic and sad. Naturally my doctor asked me what was wrong and I told her my situation and what happened between my partner and I. \n\nShe suggested I go to Womens College Hospital, they have a sexual assault and domestic violence clinic. Its a walk in service and it's free with your health card. I wasn't  going to go initially because I didn't think it was the place for me to go but while I was trying to get home the TTC supervisor kicked me out of Queens park station because I had my bike during rush hour so I took it as a sign to spend some time at the clinic and see what they could do to help me. When I walked in after 4:30 there wasn't a nurse at the desk however there were very clear instructions on how to connect with somebody. There was a phone and three buttons you could press to get in contact with the the nurse, security and one for something else I don't remember. \n\nNow understand I've been having a really hard time coming to terms that my relationship was abusive and not just \"difficult\" or \"intense\" or \"special\" there was lots of manipulation and lots of love bombing. so keep in mind I wasn't planning  being 100% honest with my nurse of the severity of the relationship. when I called the nurse on duty she was out to see me in less than 10 minutes, she gave me a form to fill in that asked for my name my address and an emergency contact, she asked me if I needed to get any tests done if there was any incident of sexual assault and if I might be pregnant. they asked me if I needed help filling out a police report (i said no and they were very  NOT pushy about anything I didn't want to do)  Then she took me to a private room and we started to talk. It was like talking to a big sister or a friend. She was so understanding with her own lived experience she was knowledgeable and very rational. she made me feel very validated and confirmed that yes what I went through was 100% abuse and very dangerous and would only get worse. that I was safe now and I could continue to stay safe and I don't have to go back to my abuser. she listened when I spoke and asked me prompting questions when I couldn't. she was intuitive about my needs and so sympathetic. most importantly she didn't judge me the more I told her. she didn't make me feel stupid for continuously trying to save this man she didn't say I was wasting time or whatever anybody else says. she understood the emotional investment and the love I felt and she understood that I was still in love and this would take a lot of time to get over. what I found really helpful is that she documented this for me. Now it's in the system that YES this happened to me and NO I wasn't over reacting or anything I wasn't crazy or over emotional like I was told I was and I was being manipulated and tricked. this will help me if I ever need proof in the future or if I ever need one more reason to put between getting back with this man. \n\nshe offered me some choices. she gave a card with the head of the department. I could email her and set up counseling appointments. he gave me the number to the nursing station and told me there was somebody there 24\\\\7 and to call if I was in need to talk to somebody. She said I could come in and talk to somebody if I needed to and that they were here for me! Lastly she gave me some printouts. One is the cycle of violence  (incident-making up-calm-tension building-incident-making up-calm-tension building-incident etc)  The various types of abuse and some examples of them, the power and control wheel (coercion and threats, intimidation, emotional abuse, isolation, minimizing and blaming, using children, economic abuse, male privilege)  and a domestic violence care package with lots of helpful information to keep me rational and linear thinking... not just thinking about my ex man. \n\nThis service is available to **anybody** experiencing domestic violence or sexual assault and weather you're out of it or still in it they will help you. they will listen to you. this is just an example of how they helped me right of the street with no prep for me coming. you also have the option to make an appointment. I'm so grateful for the nurse hat helped me out yesterday. and I hope that anybody out there who needed a hand or just needed to talk could get inspired and use this service. \n\n**Remember, you have the right to live without fear or violence**   (who knew.... not me I thought this was all NORMALLLLL) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr I went to women's college hospital in Toronto  last night and visited the sexual assault and domestic violence clinic and it was an amazing and helpful experience I would recommend to anybody who was in the struggle.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

It was very sudden, maybe a month's notice, but I told my roommate immediately. She chose to move with me, saying that she'd stay a while, save up some money, and then move back to her own hometown. The plan was that she move in the summer, around June. I was relieved because living with her is extremely difficult.\n\nJune came and went and she didn't even say a word about moving. I didn't bring it up because it took her longer than expected to find a job so I figured she needed more time. We're living in my childhood home and paying property tax and utilities, it's not expensive but there are still bills.\n\nLast month she went to visit her family for some distant relative's birthday and when she came back, she told me that she had to move back because her mom is sick and her sister needs help with her baby. She said she'd be moving in with her sister in late October. We discussed since shared purchases and she said I could keep one of them in exchange for her taking the small dining set we used before the move. As the house I'm in came partially furnished, I said that was fine. \n\nHer: Cool! I'll just need a little set, since it'll just be me in the place.\n\nMe: I thought you were moving in with your sister?\n\nHer: Oh yeah, I meant, like, my part of the house. It'll just be me there. \n\nRight.\n\nLast week I found her looking through real estate listings; I knew her sister was looking for a bigger place, so I assumed that was it. We talked a bit and she said that she was looking for a place for just her. When I asked about her moving in with family, she straight up STUTTERED and said the one of her cousins (who had been uninvolved on all this) had moved back in with his girlfriend (also uninvolved) so she was gone have to get her own place. \n\nBasically she lost track of which lie she'd told me and explained away the wrong one. I was honestly too tired to even try getting into it, but this constant lying for no reason has been our entire friendship for years and I'm just done.\n\nAll that said, I have really mixed feelings about her leaving. I have CPTSD unrelated to dealing with her and I've been severely chronically ill since birth, and as a woman in my 30s that's not a great recipe for friends. I'll be glad when she's gone, but I'm really scared of the inevitable crippling loneliness. She's not nice, she's inconsiderate, but she's always been THERE, at least. Her constant talk about how put-upon or how superior she is has been a welcome background noise on more than one occasion. \n\nBut I'm not giving her what she wants anymore (and I know that's what it is, because a week before she announced her move we got into a huge row where I told her that I know she lies CONSTANTLY and I'm tired of it, so I called her out and was no longer a valid source of supply) so she's leaving.\n\nI shouldn't be upset about this.

I decided to use dating apps to meet people because I really didn't know how. I'm no super model or super wealthy businessman but I still have a steady job and I at least don't think I'm ugly. Didn't really get matches until this one girl. She's into a lot of the same stuff I'm into and really pretty, we hit it off immediately on Bumble she even gave me her number the first day, looking back there were some weird topics coming up the first day talked like asking about prior relationships and some of the comments she made seemed like she had underlying anger and frustrations. My friends were concerned it was a red flag but said to give her a chance, We connected even more because we are both nurses and dealt with working in the nursing home world which is tough. She was goal driven and determined, I liked that in her. First date I was nervous as hell but she was really nice and sweet, nothing like those angry messages I saw on Bumble. We planned for another date, but it turned into I met one of her best friends and was thrown into a game night. Three days later she texts me going \"Want to be FB official?\", me not knowing any better and being all excited someone likes me says Yes and dives into it. I told her I want to take it steady since my first relationship but I didn't know what that meant. We texted randomly about something and she says \"stop contradicting yourself\" and goes off on me, I told her I was tired after a 16 hour shift she then goes \"I did 16 hour shifts all the time in sub acute and worked 80 hours a week, that's no excuse.\" I was upset and didn't talk to her for a few hours. She then said \"maybe we should start over\". The next date comes around and says \"maybe I shouldn't have said that nursing thing, I kind of forgot about that\". This would continue almost every other week she'd blow up at me over texts saying things \"you should think about what you say\". Over minor things. One of dumbest things she blew at me over is I told her I'd never go to Laguardia Airport because its shitty and far away but I'd still use JFK for international flights, she says JFK is farther why are you contradicting yourself. This marks the last time she'll ever apologize for anything. She also seemed to be annoyed with that I didn't smoke pot and I liked anime too much, which is weird because she likes anime too. She just kept criticizing.\n\nIn person she has been great which is why I'm like, oh this is just a work in progress. She invited me to go to her brother's wedding in Jakarta. We both use frequent flier miles for business class travel so I was able to get a flight to go Jakarta with her this November. I invite her to go with my family to Montreal in September. Because of that we both said lets meet each other's parents. Her parents liked me and my parents liked her. Her mom even invites me to her cousin's wedding and I say yes. Though my dad was concerned that she couldn't hold a job down longer than a year and a half and when I mentioned her longest relationship was a year and a half when she was 19. I'll state that I felt happy with her in person, had my first kiss with her, held hands, and after I met her parents we were just watching TV (her favorite show which I actually liked). Just sitting with her with my arms on her shoulder her head on my shoulder, that was the moment I fell in love with her. Though almost every other week I'd say something on texts or social media she didn't like.\n\nFast forward like a month or so, she randomly texts me while she's at a family party going: \"I don't feel like you're confident enough, I look at my friend's boyfriends and they look so confident, outgoing, socialable. While you are all hesistant and quiet.\" That was the one of the nails in the coffin right there. We were at odds at each other for the whole weekend and it made me upset. We had a nice hour long phone call Monday morning to smooth things over, and we had dinner that night and I thought we were good. My sister was honestly pissed I stuck with her. I told my ex I wanted someone supportive and she would try. She was saying her angry texts were \"tough love\" and we both explained our circumstances on why we are what we are. She goes on to say after being bullied in HS, she turned it around in college after 3 months and became a social butterfly and I should be able to turn it around. I told her that if this was years ago I wouldn't have the courage to talk to her, meet her parents within a month of dating, meet her best friend. She sorta got the point or at least I thought. I felt at the time though we really hit a huge milestone in the relationship and tried to increase intimacy by making out with her, it didn't work. The next day she said \"she really doesn't do long kisses\". And now we're at the death spiral phase, she posts something about complaining \"Oh I cant afford this lexus\". She posts a gift of the Lexus on a gift bow and I joke: \"If I only had the money lol\". She starts texting me going \"I hope you have enough money saved up. I already moved out of the house and have enough money. I'm not your typical cheap asian. You shouldn't even joke about buying me a car. We aren't even that serious we've known each other for 3 months\" When she criticizes she puts herself up and other people down I've noticed. A week later she says \"we need to talk I feel like we are lacking a connection, my best friend wants to meet you and wants to see what we are lacking.\" I felt like this was gonna be some double team against me so I ask to bring a friend and she's okay with it. So when they ask where to eat, I say \"wherever we can have a quality discussion\" and her friend goes \"oh thats between you two\". My friend tells me I was very socialable while she was barely talking or slightly talking to her friend. Her friend was complaining for like 15 minutes about her son choosing to go to an out of state school and it being so expensive. I remark, oh why go to a out of state school when your home state is cheaper. Apparently she took offense to that when my ex told me. I was upset as all hell, because that day my ex and me didnt even talk about what we set out to. I drove 40 minutes on short notice over it, and the phone call was barely productive but we agree to keep going.\n\nThe next day she says \"I honestly hope we can continue to grow and watch what we say to each other.\" I was skeptical but I tried. I said to her we should talk more about what happened, and she said \"theres nothing more to talk about\". A day after that she says \"we should talk\". I forget what happened around here but this is where I suggested maybe we should break up, during the call we were both hesitant and had second thoughts about it. I tell her all the times she made me upset and she lacked any empathy. She was voicing her frustrations about online dating saying that the past three years have been full of mediocre people that just want to get into her pants. But we agreed to meet on Tuesday next week because I had to cancel the Montreal flight and still remain friends. I end up seeing her on Bumble again Monday...this time she admits to being a smoker.\n\nTuesday rolls around and she says she's busy. I figured this was gonna be the end so I sent her a heartfelt text the longest I ever had. She was conflicted about how we broke up and saw that I had a pure heart, but had doubts about my confidence and maybe we could work on it. She wanted to talk to her friends to figure it out. Two days later no response so I say I hope we can pick up the pieces and remain friends. She tells me that she's already seeing someone this is two days ago. This is where I become emotionally distraught. I tell her I'm happy for her and wish her the best of luck. But for some reason it doesn't go through my head I'm not part of her life. She becomes cold on her texts and now has stopped responding. I say that with my grandmother being sick (I heard this after breaking up with her) and the breakup I'm going through a tough time. The last text she sends to me is \"I'm sorry you are having a tough time. But, overall, I need a stronger guy.\"\n\nFor some reason she won't unfriend me on Facebook. I posted a status yesterday talking about things I appreciate including the people I met and the memories I had in the summer. She complains to me \"stop tagging my friends who you barely know\" and detags herself also. I apologize to her and just say I want things to go back to normal, she hasn't read it yet. After that I'm done messaging her, she obviously doesn't want to talk. Ever since breaking up with her I sleep half the amount I do, I wake up having panic attacks, going to work I can barely function.\n\nMy friends are family are happy I got away from her. My sister calls her a bitch and mean. My parents think someone is really wrong with her and gave her a chance, but they saw how miserable she was making me. My friends told me she was narcissistic and it was good to end it now before it got worse.\n\nMy confidence is shot and the hardest part of grad school is coming. I can barely focus to read. I have friends I reach out to but for some reason I hear them but my emotions are just overwhelming me. I have an appointment with a grief counselor coming to help cope with my grandmother's illness and the breakup, I deleted her text convos and photos. Unfollowed her on Facebook, I can't bring myself to unfriend her because most of her stuff is public anyway and I'd attempt to refriend her knowing myself. Though...it got to a point she wants nothing to do with me, I tried calling her a lot to talk.\n\nI look back on it, she wasn\u2019t trying in the relationship after questioning if I would improve in my confidence. After one of our arguments we said we should text less and move more towards phone and in person communication. She even said when she\u2019s mean on texts to call her. But she barely picked up her phone and only called me once. Communication really did break down.\n\nI know what to do but it's really hard. Using the dating apps just reminds me of her, there's one girl I'm talking to that wants to meet me but it won't happen until she gets back from a work trip. I hope by the time I meet her I'm in stable enough shape to do it.\n\nLooking back since it was my first relationship I felt even more pressure to try to keep it afloat, I tried to please her the best I can to the point it was basically codependent. And now...I'm just barely getting by.\n\nTL;DR: Was in a relationship with a girl for nearly three months. Rocky the entire time with highs and lows. I suggest to end it because it would bring us more frustration, but now I feel horrible ending it and she moved on so easily. While I'm a wreck.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

As a child I loved every moment I had with you, I want them to experience that and I want you to get the love that you deserve in return.\n\nThrough my adult years I have kept my distance. I don\u2019t know if you wondered why, or you knew that it wasn\u2019t you - it was your husband. I have learned through a lot of support that boundaries help me to stay sane and healthier, and one of those boundaries in addition to this distance is that I no longer call your husband my grandpa. He does not deserve that title in my life, and that took me a long time to realize. It took me an equally long time to realize that this impacts you as my grandma and I feel it is unfair for you to not be aware of why. \n\nGrowing up he took advantage of something that I never could fully grasp until I had children of my own. He took advantage of the trust, love, and innocence of the heart of a child. He left scars on my mind and in my body that have greatly and gravely influenced my life, my heart, my mind and my health for years. These experiences planted seeds in me that made me hate myself, made me feel so confused that I only felt shame and blame toward myself, at times made me not want to live because I was so overwhelmed by the incredibly confusing pain and chaos it put my brain into. I buried this hurt, I numbed this hurt, in healthy and not so healthy ways. Over the past decade and especially over the last 2 years I\u2019m learning to accept what happened, I\u2019m learning to love myself, I\u2019m learning my body needs to heal and I\u2019m the only one who can choose healthy ways to help that process happen. \n\nI struggled with knowing whether to share this Burden with you. But I know that keeping secrets give them power, and telling them, when ready can set you free. I don\u2019t know but maybe this freedom would apply to you too.\n\nI had a dream - that I could call you and check in on you and visit you with your great grand daughters and that we could have years of Sunday dinners and grandma mom dates that never happened back. We never had those because I couldn\u2019t be near him, I didn\u2019t know how without feeling sickness, sadness, self loathing and fear. I had to set boundaries from him. I have a new dream - that you can understand why and we can move forward together with that understanding. \n\nI am not naive anymore, I know this is an incredibly complex situation. I know we can\u2019t erase feelings and emotions just because we learn something new and I wouldn\u2019t expect that. I know this will be hard to process, and for that I am deeply sorry, as I don\u2019t wish you any more pain. \n\nI love you and I hope we can connect and talk about our relationship.

I hope I post to the right place, sorry if not.\n\nFor note, English is my second language but try to do my best and I'm also on phone.\n\nI'm 25F in relationship with my man for almost 2 years, living together half year. \nI love him. My mind love his traits, see his weaknesses and accept them. But I don't &gt;feel&lt; the deep love toward him. It's not like the \"with time love changes\" thing, it's that I'm numb. \n\nBefore him I had The.Love.Of.My.Life.. I was so deeply in love with him, I could even make him a new sky with stars instead of take one down. My family told I was so vibrant, bubbly, energetic, Generally Happy and In Love, they were so happy for me/us.\n\nThe guy was immature, I was emotionally unstable, slashing out, being clingy (due to family problems, my other post can give hint), always looked for his attention. Back in those days I just tried to stay above water and love him and rely on him but he never let me. He always shrugged off my problems, didn't give me comfort, nor opinion. One time I directly asked him \" why don't you say anything? A simple emoji (&lt;3) not answer, I Need You!\"\n\" I don't want to be included in, your family is problematic and you don't do anything to change\" \n\nI might give my past a post, now my family is totally fine, we are all on good terms gladly\u2764\ufe0f \n\nFew months later he out of blue breaks up with me. Literally no red flags, maybe a bit more distant but he was on Uni and else... On a Thursday he just wrote me a long ass letter on facebook that that's all, he is done with me. It was the answer for \"do you come tomorrow? You promised\"\nThe two most hurtful sentence in those shitstorm: \n1 I don't write you to ask let me go. I write to tell you I go.\n2 Why are you so clingy? Let me live (second day after breakup), you are a bloodsucker.\nHe was frigid, distant, no emotions. For a week I cried and mourned him. For comparison when my Grand's died I never cried just at the funerals. I couldn't see colours, food didn't have taste, emotions rolled out of me with each teardrop and I had a sea in my eyes. Eventually I sucked up myself and tried to move on (family push, didn't let me get through it normally.... Previous post reasons it) \nSince those days I feel I lost part of myself. \nI'm menthally stable (fuckin not but can cooperate it), I learned a lot from my mistakes and his. I forgave him, he was two years younger than me, 23F and 21M at the time. I DID have problematic life back there. I forgave his spineless moves as I have to move on and mourn or hold grudge for it doesn't lead anywhere.\n\nI was always a daydreamer back in days. I saw my wedding. I planned things, go to tour, trips, do things. I believed in friends. I was generally positive, optimistic but this breakup broke the core of my soul and he took parts of me with him.. I lost the girl in me and left the broken woman there. I felt, I died a bit.\n\nMove forward to these days. I have this awesome man. He has issues sure but who not? \nHe can chill me down when I'm upset. He can handle my sharkweek-hormon-chaos. He can handle when I have fever and talk and cry and fall in myself ( I handle sickness really bad in cold seasons). He makes crazy-me back to normal-me. He listens if I'm upset and even if time to time he handles my problems wrong, he tries(!!!) to help me. He teaches me to be me. He encourages when I'm afraid of a task ( social anxiety* and I'm a sales manager.... Bad pairing)  and cheers me if I do something difficult or if I get promotion or whatever in work. I can lay on his shoulder, I can sleep on his chest, he hugs me every night and even if we fight before sleep, we budge each other until we get on good terms as it's so wrong to be mad at each other. He learned to apologise to me. He is willing to do it, he feels when he is wrong. I don't press him ( expect the fight itself), I don't say things like \" you have to apolgise to me\" it's not a demand. It's his decision. And he takes it. \n\nBut deep in down I feel I'm still locked. I have trust issues ( I trust him as it. No spy, no shitty things, I literally let him do things other women would divorce for)  and can't let my last boundaries to fall down because he might will hurt me. I'm not not-trust-him. I don't trust love itself? Trust? I don't trust trust? \nWe literally talk about future family, wedding, life together but my damn deep emotions, the happy ones are still under locket and I threw somewhere the key where I can't find it.

He is the first boyfriend I have ever had. The nature of our sexual relationship was a faux BDSM one meaning it was abusive and not following any of what I suppose the standard rules are. He groomed me to think things were okay when they are not. He is someone who ignores what no means. He has lied about other women from the very beginning of us dating. He has choked me to the point of passing out and has slapped me so hard that my ear was ringing for a week after.  Since we are long-distance, his forms of abuse have changed to the more verbal and emotional from making fun of me if I gain some weight, telling me I'm stupid and gaslighting me.  He currently goes to grad school in a city hundreds of miles away from me. We've broken up before a couple of months ago when we spent spring break together once the demands, the rape, and the cheating got to be too much for me. \n\nHowever, at some point, he started harassing me calling me all times of the night messaging my friends and family on facebook. I blocked him, but he just started calling and texting me on phone numbers that I had not blocked. I also had him banned from my school campus after I was worried he might try to see me. After about a month of creepy messages, the tone of the texts had changed to a pathetic pleading kind saying that he's tried dating other girls and he feels like such an idiot for losing me and wanting another chance. I agreed to give him that chance, and I regret that now. At first, I intended on giving him that chance, but then I realized that his misogynist and abusive ways would never actually change. \n\nI recognize a big part why I am back with him is loneliness and wanting comfort, but I also know that I am surrounded by plenty of people who love me. I have seen a therapist weekly since, and they know everything. However, while my family knows that I'm still talking to him, only two of my friends know both of which are quietly supporting me to break up with him.  When we first broke up I told all of my friends that would listen that he is a monster as a means to resist temptation, which failed. This significant part of me who loves his nonabusive side and knows that he depends on me emotionally. I'm so stupidly hesitant to let go. I am also incredibly worried that since he has sexual pictures and videos of me that something might happen there. He thinks I'm going to visit him for a weekend in two weeks, but I'm not going to so the sooner, the better. \n\nWhat I am asking for here is how should I break up with him? Where do I even find the strength to go through with it? I just want to get away from him and I don't feel comfortable right now to go to the authorities.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

My stomach was in knots. I basically disassociated from myself and felt no connection to anything at all in this world. He told me this morning over the phone that I need to grow the fuck up and stop acting like a child because I was crying and telling him that I couldn't get out of bed because I was so sad. He did not care one bit for that.

I\u2019m 28, he\u2019s 34. \n\nI moved to Australia so that my abusive mum could \u201cput me in line\u201d, I was 16 at the time. I was kicked out after about eight months, I was just short of turning 17 when I had to find a job and quit school all because I got kicked out of home. (I was apparently a delinquent but my sister was so much worse than me in what she used to lie and manipulate to our mum about. My mum would always blame me, my mums partner out his hands around my neck at my sisters husbands 21st party and my mum forcibly twisted my wrists to comply with her demands. I was then shoved into the back of the car and I managed to get away. I never returned after that. So let\u2019s just say I\u2019ve had a rough teenage hood.\n\nFast forward to now, I have been living with my other half for almost our entire relationship. And to be fair, it hasn\u2019t been great since the beginning. But I want to know if I deserve better, because he has me convinced that I don\u2019t. \n\nIt started back around September of 2014, he used to make fun of my weight but say he was only joking. I am literally a size 4-6 in US standards and 8-10 in AU dress size. Just food for thought, by December of that same year, I lost about 10kg due to stress, I was now a size 2US/6AU in size and it wasn\u2019t good enough for him. He kept pressuring me to lose more weight and bottled it down to the sex he was apparently \u201cgiving\u201d me. In that same year, he would call me a Bitch on a daily basis.

In 2015, we had an argument and we were on our rural property. He warned that he would hurt me if I didn\u2019t \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d, obviously I was hurt by his words and said \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t\u201d, well boy was I wrong. He put his hands around my neck for a solid minute, pushed up against a wall.\n\nWhy did I forgive him? Why didn\u2019t I leave after the first incident? \n\nFuck. \nHe made me feel as though I deserved the abuse. He would outright tell me if I did something to annoy him or piss him off, that this was justification for his abusive behaviour. \n\nHe would call me names and put me down pretty much our entire relationship. (This was just to keep me in place)\n\nHe worked at a Bank but mostly worked from home to \u201ckeep tabs on me\u201d because he finds me untrustworthy, though I was the only person doing both our fair share of the house keeping.

Yet this man never lifted a finger, he even made me pick up after him in his home office.

He never cooked or took me out on dates because \u201cit\u2019s a waste of money\u201d. He is an absolute slob.\n\nI still don\u2019t know why I\u2019m still with him. \n\nCut a long story short, i think I\u2019m finally ready to move on, this morning was the last straw, not only did he call me names and put me down for pulling him up on hitting me consecutively about 6 times in my back while I was asleep. 6 FUCKING TIMES. Like I\u2019m not fucking crazy. But had the audacity to call me a liar and that he was \u201casleep\u201d. But he\u2019s done this before.... this incident repeated itself almost to a tee. He said I must of been \u201ctoo close to him\u201d.... I was pushed up against the wall... I was no where near him...\n\nI broke down. \ud83d\ude41 I am now on my way to work feeling absolutely devastated that this whole relationship was a fountain of abuse and I really just want to share to anyone who will listen.\n\nThank you", "subreddit": "abuse"}

We started dating when i was 15, i am now an adult, i think that being in this type of intense negative relationship so early on negatively affected how i act/see things today in relationships. For example my ex had created such an intense trauma bond that we would fight almost daily about him cheating on me or whatever was the current issue, he would just let me rant barely acknowledging me so something in me would snap and i would very literally go from saying \u201ci hate you\u201d to \u201ci love you\u201d the next sentence, to which he would always immediately reply giving me positive attention. Now in any new relationship i\u2019ve gotten in i\u2019ve gotten a number of similar complaints about how i expect arguments to randomly end and im \u201cbi-polar\u201d and switch moods too quickly. Another example of the long-term affects i\u2019ve experienced are that i can\u2019t feel attraction to anything but my partner and i obsess over them to an unhealthy extent and i feel that if they don\u2019t reciprocate these things im being slighted and if that they can feel attraction to anything other than me it feels as if im being cheated on. I know this is because my ex groomed me to think that this is how a relationship should work, but i wonder if theres anyway out of this way of thinking or if its just permanently in my head now. My more recent ex i suspect is also a narcissist so he didn\u2019t really help my situation, he cheated on me and future faked me CONSTANTLY, we were together for a year and it was misery and just another huge blow to my self esteem. Also as far as the attraction thing goes i dont see any flaws in my thinking and i fully believe that feeling attraction is cheating but i am aware that no one agrees with me and i can never be happy this way.

I don't really understand a lot about it, but I toyed with the idea that he was gaslighting for the past 2 years. That, or maybe I became super paranoid somewhere along the way. I kept doubting myself for a long time, but I finally broke when, a couple of months ago, he stood over my teenager and me shouting that he didn't care about me having PTSD because he \"shouldn't have to suffer for the damage someone else did.\" Idk why that did it, he had said similar things before, but that statement and I suddenly saw him for exactly who he is. I was with him for 6 years. He knew from the first time we met I had PTSD. Instead of being supportive, it always came up in this context, that *he* was being \"punished\" for it. The last 2 months since then, once that veil was finally lifted, have been insufferable. But I have part of that tirade of his recorded, and have taken notes consistently about all the little day-to-day things. \n\n\nHe emotionally abused us in a lot of little ways: constantly \"checking\" on me, like coming in and out of the bedroom if I was talking to my teenager, or just sitting down and completely interrupting our conversation to make sure we couldn't or weren't talking about him. He audio recorded our conversations, which I didn't find out about until much later. He monitored when I was on FB or Messenger, and would interrogate me about who this or that friend was. He started living on his device so he could bust in the bedroom if I opened Messenger so he could \"catch\" me doing something (idk what he thought I was doing). But ofc all of this he would completely deny bc *I* was obviously paranoid and must think he's a \"monster\" (his words, that I never said). He purposely interrupted any question my teenager asked me or any convo we were having no matter where we were, he told me things like \"You know she lies to you constantly\" or \"You just don't see how nasty she is to me.\" Meanwhile, he completely ignored his teenager, to the point of the kid bluntly asking a question and his dad just flat-out ignoring that the kid was even there. Just silence until the kid just walked away or I answered him. \n\n\n\nHe loved to act like he knew important people personally, did so many charity things, and was a Very Important Person at one time (I have no idea how much, if any, of this is true). He knew everything there is to know about a couple of specific things, and would go on long diatribes about how someone on TV got it wrong, or about how all these people (all women) online were asking him to do this or that for them (related to specific thing) and he was having to teach them and explain to them and they were asking such stupid questions so he had to set them straight. He constantly corrected everyone on mundane things, but when he was proven wrong, he obviously *meant* something different... or was right, just in a different way... or sometimes he was just still right meaning he knew more about it than Google. \n\n\nAgain, he knew from Day 1 I had PTSD and a lot of trauma, esp sexual, and for the first few years he loved my alcoholism (not that that was his fault by any means) because it got him what he wanted. Then I got sober, and he continuously brought up embarrassing things I did even though I repeatedly asked him not to bc it made me uncomfortable and ashamed and made it harder to work through. He told me early on he \"wasn't like other guys\" and \"didn't need sex all the time\" and totally understood and would be \"perfectly happy if we never had sex\" bc he loved *me* and didn't need that. And when I stopped drinking and had to start dealing with the trauma, instead of being supportive and understanding, he pushed me, constantly pressured me, gave me guilt trips. Times I had the courage to say \"no\" he immediately followed with \"but why\u2026\" and more pressuring or groping. He figuratively (and a couple times literally) forced himself on me. He once literally shoved himself in my face/mouth while standing over me, after I had repeatedly asked him to stop and leave me alone. He said things like \"I guess you really don't love me anymore,\" and when I told him he was putting too much pressure on me, he would get angry, bc I didn't tell him that in the right way or at the right time, or bc I was \"making him out to be a monster.\" He still consistently claimed he was happy never to have sex with me (even though I wasn't ever implying that) and that he would never ever want me to feel pressured\u2026 while still groping me every day, making nothing but sexual comments to me for days on end, and putting more and more pressure on me every night until I would give in just to get some peace for a few days. But times I explained that I felt uncomfortable and needed some space, he got angry I was \"accusing him\" of treating me like that, again making him into a \"monster\" even though I always made sure to frame it as my personal problem that was inconveniencing him (not sarcasm). \n\n\nHe was ridiculously needy. \"Do you really love me?\" \"How much do you love me?\" \"Why do you love me\" (forcing me to give examples that he seemed sufficient). \"I feel like I'm losing you.\" (when I said no to having sex.) \"I guess I just bug you all the time, I'll leave you alone.\" (totally unprompted, then followed by the silent treatment and tension he forced into the room so I knew he was Mad.) Wjen he screamed at me and I argues back... \"I should just kill myself I guess.\" \"I can't believe I thought you loved me.\" On and on and on. It always felt so whiny and pathetic to me, and was very inconsistent with this \"I know everything and am the best there is\" facade he put on. And everything was black or white. I don't kiss him in the morning or say \"good night\" the wrong way and it was 'woe is me, I get it, you hate me, I'll leave you alone forever I guess.' I had to play along no matter how uncomfortable it made me, bc if I didn't it would turn into rage at me treating him so badly.\n\n\nThe constant lying, constantly reminding me how \"he did everything for us\" (not even close, he did the bare minimum, and even then it was conditional on whether you were in his favor or not). I could go on and on, but this is already a wall of text. This is just the stuff that is rising to the surface now, there is so much more, all seemingly \"picky\" or mundane, but he always was very careful to do things he could explain away, and say the most insignificant things with the absolute nastiest tones or looks, so he could always claim later he was misunderstood, or we \"took it the wrong way.\" He never once legitimately or meaningfully used the words \"I'm sorry.\" For *anything*. His \"apology\" was always \"that's not what I meant\" or \"I'm sorry you felt that way about it, but...\" \n\nI haven't proofread this, I just have to get it OUT. I welcome any support anyone can give, bc I still occasionally feel like this is all tiny little stuff that I've blown out of proportion\u2026 he's had me convinced that I'm paranoid and crazy for so long that I still second guess myself, and my therapist, and the rest of my support system. I'd love to hear others' experiences with this type of gaslighting/ narcissism on a day-to-day basis if anybody is comfortable sharing, like the little stuff that always just sat with you wrong. Thanks for letting me vent.\n\n\nTLDR: Just left gaslighting and narc behavior, still figuring everything out, needed to vent and would love support.

I didn't trust my own perception of my reality. I knew something was off, but I thought it was something wrong with me. I don't remember now what made me come to this subreddit exactly, but I saw some book recommendations. I read \"Why Does He Do That?\" so fast and jumped right into \"The Verbally Abusive Relationship.\" Holy shit.\n\nOnce I saw the relationship for what it was, I couldn't unsee it. I still didn't think I would be one of those people who felt better when it was over; I was convinced I would feel worse, but I was crawling out of my skin. It used to feel impossible to leave but then it felt impossible to stay.\n\nWhat actually happened: With each step I took - telling my friends, doing the math to see what I could afford on my own, looking for a new place, packing, telling him it was over- I felt more and more like myself. I realized his narrative wasn't true.\n\nI know that it isn't all over. Being in that relationship for years has certainly had an immense impact on me, and leaving 2 weeks ago didn't fix it. But immediately my life feels different, I guess because it's mine now. There is no one judging me, criticizing me, yelling at me, gaslighting me, insulting my character. I'm not constantly on the verge of tears, I don't have that sick feeling in the pit of my stomach, my hands aren't shaking all the time, I can get excited about things and laugh and make mistakes.\n\nI am very grateful to everyone who posts in this subreddit. Seeing things from an outside perspective made my own situation clearer and it was very validating, and reading other people's stories about leaving made me feel like maybe I could do it too. Thank you. I forgot life could feel like this, and for the past few days I have been wondering \"what is this feeling I have now?\" It's hope!  I don't think I have felt truly hopeful in at least 4.5 years. If you're reading this and considering leaving, trust that you are more than capable and it's better than you can imagine.

He was a popular jock and I was a social outcast who hung out with the computer geeks but only because nobody else seemed to want to be around me.\n\nIt was absolutely done to degrade me. This particular guy and most of his friends bullied me on a daily and many of them were in the room when this happened. I did nothing about it at the time because I didn't have any friends there in the room with me, and few friends at all. I also never approached a teacher about it, but in hindsight, I should have because this was absolutely a sexual assault, albeit not on the level that many people I know have experienced. This only happened once, and it was probably a peer-fueled thing.\n\nI had many a revenge fantasy about this guy when I was younger. He was bigger and stronger than me and I certainly felt powerless. I also doubted for a long time that anyone would have listened to me at the time, but maybe they would've.\n\nAbout 18 months ago, talking to a friend about her own experience being sexually assaulted made me revisit this experience, and, at one point it brought me to tears in the bathroom at my work.\n\nI ended up not finishing high school, for a lot of reasons, but, I was a very dysfunctional, mentally ill teenager and while I did go back and finish school, I didn't really have my life together until I was about 24. This guy never did anything physical to me again, but he absolutely bullied me opportunistically for the remainder of my time at school - although I might have only had two or three classes with him after that year.\n\nFor the past 18 months or so, I've been contemplating confronting him about this. These days, I have a pretty good life. I have a degree and an okay job, I've had relationships and been on holidays and been able to chase some dreams. I'm 28 and I really feel like life didn't start for me until four or five years ago, but, now, life is fairly good. I don't care about money or anything like that. I just want to confront this person because I've grown to realise what a profound effect his actions had on me, and I want him to know that I remember what he did to me.\n\nI'm friends with him on Facebook. He seems to have a great life. He's engaged to his high school sweetheart. If I do this, I could ruin that life. It could also all backfire on me, I think anyone who might have witnessed it happen would be more likely to back him up. I'm also sure that he has more money than I do and therefore if it ever came to it, he could afford better lawyers, etc than I would be able to.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

She has always used her son (now 14) as a hook to keep me in some contact with her, despite the fact that we stopped being intimate five years ago. She knows I'm a good influence on him, and I've tried to be, in spite of the fact that even though she and I haven't been a couple in forever, my attempt to remain on civil terms with her has run down the same track as it did when we were together:Nastily.\n\nIn other words there are still intermittent episodes of raging, lashing out, projecting and gaslighting, even though I have for a while now been able to stay at a safe distance from her and have healed a great deal in the interim. So this pretty low contact has allowed me to keep in touch with her son and see him every couple of weeks. Importantly, I have been able to drastically reduce my contacts with her because he has his own phone now and we can communicate without her involvement .... and guess how that has impacted her LOL.\n\nAs a result, now I truly feel a need to separate more fully, because I can spider-sense her increasing manipulation re: my contact with him (\"Oh, missing another one of his soccer games?? Pathetic.\")and I am feeling some guilt about making the boy feel my distance, which in order to stay away from her ramped-up interaction is no doubt going to increase.\n\nThe good news? He's a great kid, a good student, involved in sports and has lots of friends. So it's not at all like he's dependent on me; I am and always have been a figure in his life who while not central has been present and steady, but he is hardly going to collapse if I lessen my contact.\n\nAnyhow as I have written, his mother has already begun to try and shame and guilt me for trying to keep myself safe, and I guess I am asking you guys for support in wanting to protect myself at this time by stepping back for a time from him in order to safeguard my recovery (she dosed me a major case of C-PTSD that took a lot of time and effort and money to overcome) from too many awful, anguishing, horrid days with her.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I would tell her that I didn't like being angry or becoming aggressive/violent and i'd try to get away from her, but somehow I wasn't able to?

I told her I couldn't continue with the way things were between us, that I didn't want to feel angry about people she was becoming friends with, that I didn't like feeling jealous to the extent that I did. I felt like she would in a way instigate it? and then make me feel guilty by telling me \"for someone who claims that they want to change. you're still behaving the same way\" when things would escalate and get violent, and when I would get away from her, she would tell me, almost like scold me because I would leave, and say that  she doesn't leave like I do. at least not anymore. I would feel such anger, so scared of myself, I would feel so violently angry that I was scared of hurting her more than what I had already done. \n she would be the one walking away in the beginning of the relationship and I felt so horrible. I'd be sobbing and crying for her to come back and I feel like that was manipulative of me.

I didn't realize I needed therapy for sexual abuse until I was about 29, so I've only been healing from this for about a year since I started therapy.\n\nI'm distressed by the fact that for a long time I've had trouble or taken a long time to orgasm when masturbating, but recently discovered that if I think of sex with my father, in the same chair he molested me in, while I masturbate, I do have an orgasm. It's the freakiest thing and I don't want that to be how I get off; in my subconscious mind, maybe I associate my dad and that location with sex? But in my conscious mind, I DO NOT want that kind of relationship with my dad. He was my hero growing up and I wish I could still say that; I want a loving relationship with him, but not a sexual one.\n\nWhen I'm with my boyfriend (30M, we've been together about 8 months), I take a very long time to orgasm, upwards of an hour, and sometimes do not at all, although he makes me feel great and is very sexy. (We aren't having sex until we're married, so this is oral/fingering.) \n\nI'm frightened and want to find a way to get past the apparent subconscious attraction to my father. My counselor says that is common in victims, but I'm not sure what practical steps I need to take to change. I'm slowly working through a book for incest survivors (Healing Steps), but I looked through it and I'm not sure it covers this topic (though it's been very therapeutic otherwise so far). Does anyone have any advice or guidance? I'm pretty desperate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr Thoughts of dad can make me orgasm while masturbating, while oral/fingering with boyfriend do not.

Seeing him with his new SO brought the worst memories and feelings I put aside in me.  Those feelings how he made me feel crazy, that I wasn't good enough, how everything he did was my fault. Every single negative emotion that I experienced when I was with him came back in one giant emotional wave.\n\nI'm not gonna lie, I was overwhelmed by that and for an hour or so, I started believing those thoughts. That it was my fault, I could have done this and that to prevent the breakup and we would have been together and happy. Then I started visiting this sub and re-reading the top posts as well as the recent ones. \n\n\nEverytime I read a post in this post, I found myself saying \"That happened to me\" \"that too\" \"and that too\". How he would cheat and lie to me and somehow it was my fault. How he would apologize but follow with \"...but\"  \"how he LOVED to call me batshit crazy\" when I was just responding to his lies and gaslighting etc. Then I realized no I'm not crazy. There is absolutely nothing I could have done when we were together that would have changed the outcome. Had I been \"less crazy\" and more tolerant to his bs and lies. Yes, we would have lasted longer but eventually he would have discarded me. It was matter of time. The only reason he discarded me the moment he did because he had found new supplies (going on hookup apps to find \"friends\") and that unlike, anyone he was ever with at that point, I called him out when he broke his words and tried to swift blame.\n\n\nI may not have been perfect. I could have been better in expressing my emotions. But after the constant lies and manipulations, I'd yell at him when he did the same exact thing he had done before. I was frustrated and mad how could he have done the exact same thing we talked about again and again. Why was I not heard? Why were his words so empty and hollow?\n\nI remember he said, after the break up.. he wished I didn't ask questions when we were together. how was this healthy? I shouldn't have asked him when I found out he had a hookup app on his phone (grindr). I shouldn't have asked him when he broke his words/promises? I shouldn't have asked him when he exchanged pics and numbers with guys he met on Grindr and told me he was just looking for friends? this wasn't healthy. this wasn't gonna last, no matter what. nothing I could have done would have prevented this. \n\nSo, thank you for all of you for sharing your stories and posting here. They help. They really do.\n\nThe good aftermath, now, is that I have become less tolerant with BS. I listen to my guy feelings more. I'm often right than wrong when I listen to them. I hold myself accountable too when I do wrong. I try to do right thing whenever possible. For example, last week the cashier at grocery store accidentally charged me less than I actually owed. I walked away and thought it was wrong. So, I went back to the aisle and re-checked the price. I was right, he charged me $.20  less. This was not a big deal. They were not gonna arrest me or anything esp when the mistake was done by the cashier. But I went back and asked him to fix it and he did. I felt very proud of myself in that moment.\n\nthe bad aftermath is that I have issues trusting people, now. I like being alone with my dog. I've gone on a few dates here and there but nothing stick and I'm afraid I may never find one. But at the same time, I'm starting to accept that it's okay too, I don't need another person to complete me. But the worst aftermath out of everything else is that what happened with my nex left a huge ugly emotional scar. everyday I'm reminded of it. it doesn't hurt anymore but I know it's there to remind me of what happene.\n\nBut in the meantime, thanks to all of you here, I know that I'm not crazy like he loved telling me I was. I know that I was in the right for questioning him when he tried to BS me and cheated on me. I know that, even if I was the perfect SO to him, he would have discarded me eventually.\n\n No matter how good I could have done, he would have dumped me for someone else like he always did.\n\nHe even told me one night when he was drunk \"I cannot not breakup with someone until I find someone new.\" Those were his exact words, word for word.\n\nHe, of course denied it and said I took it out of context. It was a red flag, I knew it was a red flag but I ignored it. \n\n\nThanks for reading!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

That didn't last very long, but at the time I was convinced he was truly trying. Then it basically came out that he hadn't really gone to therapy, I don't know if he ever really has gone at all, but he often talks about how when he goes he has these bad experiences, always excuses and never any changes. When we finally broke up 8 months later, things had gotten really bad. It was very obvious because we lived together, that he wasn't getting any real help or wanting to change at all. Anyways now it's been 3 months since we broke up and his friend told me he has been going to therapy and started medication. I'm very skeptical, because he's lied before, but I'm curious if anyone has actually seen their narc want to change &amp; follow through. It's all moot to me because I'm not trying to reconnect, but I am a bit curious because if he really does find help, it would mean he might actually stop doing this to other people.

Even when I didn\u2019t want to hear it. They\u2019d talk about their sexual attraction to people other than each other and the sex they had when they first started dating.\n\nWhen I started puberty (9-10ish) I remember my Dad and Mum making comments about my ass and saying they\u2019d have to fend off boys for me. \n\nWhen I was little (10-12ish), I told my Dad I didn\u2019t want to have sex after it came up in conversation. He got mad at me and said sex eases stress and I\u2019ll have a \u201cdesire to breed\u201d when I get older so I\u2019ll have to have it. They said asexuals are freaks. \n\nAround the time I turned 13-14, my Dad started smacking my ass randomly. I hated it, and in retaliation I\u2019d hit him as hard as I could. But that never stopped him. When I told my Mum about this, she laughed it off and said I should grow thicker skin. He hasn\u2019t smacked me since March, but now he\u2019s started doing it to my brother (who\u2019s 13). He told my Dad he hated it, and I yelled at him to stop after I heard my brother say that. My Dad just said to me \u201cwhat are you gonna do about it?\u201d\n\nBack to when I was younger, I remember my Dad forcing me to sleep with him while we stayed over at a family friend\u2019s house. I don\u2019t know if he touched me sexually in anyway while I sleeping, but he didn\u2019t when I was awake. He forced me to spoon him, with him as the bigger spoon. It made me so uncomfortable I woke up after an hour or 2 and slept on the couch. \n\nI know this isn\u2019t a trans subreddit, but the fact that I\u2019m female-to-male transgender is important for the next 2 points. I figured out I was trans over a year. I\u2019m still closeted to my parents because they\u2019re transphobic, but when I started binding my chest, my Mum kept asking me why it was so flat, and forcibly lifted up my shirt to see what I was wearing underneath it. Even after I fought her and told her not to touch me. \n\nThe most recent thing to happen to me happened yesterday while my Dad was driving me home from school. He yelled at me for multiple reasons. The thing that affected me  most though, was when he said that he had seen my breasts and said they were big and that \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be binding them down\u201d and kept asking me why I didn\u2019t like them. He also forced me to answer questions about my underwear. \n\nAll of these things have made sex and intimacy really uncomfortable for me. I\u2019m horrified of people touching me, and I especially won\u2019t let my parents hug me or hold hands with me. I can\u2019t turn my back to my Dad because I feel like he\u2019s going to smack my ass. I\u2019m ashamed of wanting to have sex because I feel it makes me more like my parents. And I\u2019m ashamed of having a high sex drive like my Dad. I don\u2019t want to spoon anyone or have anyone smack my ass because it just brings back memories of my Dad. I can\u2019t concentrate on my school work because of what my Dad said yesterday. I just keep thinking about it over and over and how uncomfortable it made me. I\u2019m underaged, and as such not sexually active, but I feel like my parents ruined sex for me. \n\nCould any of this be considered sexual abuse?

I was always taking time off from work to spend with her. But it was never good enough. She would always say she needs a man that can hang out with her on the weekend like normal people. I tried to explain to her I have to work but I always made time and scheduled important things. \n\nFast forward a little and discovered that she was an alcoholic that drinks every night just to go to sleep. If I didn't agree with everything that she said it turned into an argument and I would get told \"f*** you\" and \"get the f*** out of my house\"\nThen I would get tons of texts saying don't come back here again she's done. I've been told \"I wish you weren't here\" so I would leave and here came the f*** you comments again. I would go home and wake up to tons of texts and missed calls saying she's sorry and can we reset? This happened probably 50 times or more within month 3 and 8. Then she started locking her phone. She would say there's plenty of people lined up that want to date her and that her ex wants her back. \n\nWhen we would get into any kind of altercation she acted as it didn't phase her if I was with her or not. She started calling me crazy and telling me I need medication. She always would tell me she would always be the best sex partner I would ever have. She seemed more of empty promises than anything else. No patience whatsoever. \n\nTowards the end she got a text and her face lit up like a kid at Christmas and she flipped her phone over so fast your head would spin. So I asked her who was that? She said it was her ex. I said well what does he want? She said I'm not telling you. Well she finally said he wants to know what she's doing tonight? So naturally I left. Come to find out it wasn't her ex it was some new guy. I found out bc I called her phone from a different number and she answered and didn't know it was me bc that's how f***** up she was then some guy got on the phone saying where are you we ordered food 2 hours ago. So I sent messages to her and calling her. Of course I was blocked. \n\nShe still won't answer me why she cheated the way she did. Her response was always \"leave me alone\" and \"please stop messaging me\"\nBut yet when I ignored her she acted like the world was ending. She always said in the beginning \"there's nothing you can do to make me leave you\"\n\nShe responds to what she wants to respond to and it really gets to me. I can ask her all kinds of questions and never get a response. But the moment I ask her can we talk she responds with she's busy or she's sleeping. Which isn't true bc if she were she wouldn't had responded in the first place. It really gets to me.\n\nSo why did she cheat? Why did she just go cold? Why did she just completely ignore me and cut me off?\n\nI'm at a loss for words for her.

So while there was a lot of awful stuff going on, one of the strangest things that has stuck with me and made me feel unsettled and really convinced me at first that I was crazy was him doing little random innocent things but with an obvious malicious intent. But they were things he could easily lie about or pretend I was just paranoid, and the only reason they ever came up between us was bc they left me feeling so weird and uncomfortable but I could never really pinpoint *why*.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo, for example, when I first moved in, he would walk into our bedroom multiple times while I showered in the adjacent bathroom. Like 3-5 times in 20 minutes, and only come in for a few seconds and then leave. I was in the shower, so first I assumed he was just getting something or looking for something or whatever. But this happened every. single. time. I remember standing in the shower and being able to time within half a minute when he was going to come back in. It was something that just made no sense. He wasn't coming in the bathroom, there was never any other time that he was in and out of the room like that (trust me, I looked for it). Sometimes he would tell me some random thing from the other side of the door, sometimes he was just in for a few seconds and out again. It was unnerving. After months I finally asked him to stop, and I explained it made me uncomfortable. He immediately got loud and defensive, told me I was crazy to think he was doing anything intentionally, that I was obviously paranoid and had serious issues, and how dare I tell him he wasn't allowed in his own room anymore, and he definitely did not do it every time or 3 times in one shower, that I was completely imagining it and I needed to get mental help.\u00a0\n\n\nSince I already knew I was bipolar and had anxiety and what would later be diagnosed as PTSD, and he knew all about stuff I had been through in the past before we got serious, I was stunned by his response. I expected it to be supportive, like 'I'm sorry, I didn't know it bothered you' and for there to be a completely innocent explanation. (Well, looking back, I didn't expect that or I wouldn't have waited so long to say something. But I hoped for it, and hoped he would surprise me by not reacting the way he did.) Instead, this was the response I got, and it made me think I must just be paranoid and crazy, bc I couldn't explain *why* it was so unnerving.\n\n\n\nThere's lots of other little examples, most of them invasions of privacy like this that were easy for him to pretend to be clueless and hide his real intentions. I still don't really understand what those intentions were. I think that was another thing that made it easier to believe I was just paranoid\u2026 bc I couldn't think of any reason he would do these things on purpose. It just didn't make any sense, so I thought it must be me. \n\n\n\nHe constantly barged in on me changing to make lewd and objectifying comments, and if I said anything it was easy for him to make excuses or say he thought I liked it or whine about how I didn't really love him. \n\n\n\nHe would shut down any private convo between my teenager and I if we were in a room alone, by just barging in and starting to talk, or sitting on the bed until she got uncomfortable and stopped talking, and then he would stare at her until she left.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI know this is long, but it's difficult to paint this picture. I don't know if this was just a malicious quirk of his or if this is something common. This is probably the one thing, even with all the obvious abuse, that bothered me the most bc it was just so unsettling and so easy for him to gaslight me with. I'd love to hear others' thoughts on it or if anyone wants to share a similar experience. I'm trying to figure out all the ins and outs of the gaslighting, though I know I'll never unravel it all. But I still feel very uneasy and scared of him either luring me back in in the long run or using these techniques on the ppl I love. \n\n\n\nI also think it's good to talk about the little stuff, bc when I first became suspicious I was being gaslit, all of the articles and examples I found online seemed so much more extreme than the day-to-day I experienced. I convinced myself it wasn't happening partly based on not seeing my life portrayed in the common portrait of this abuse. It took a horrible experience of overt abuse for me to open up to my therapist about it, and it wasn't until I started talking about all the little things with her that I realized I really was being gaslit and he really was behaving exactly like a CN. Thanks to anyone who wants to comment, either to share or just for support. I know I'm long-winded, but that's just me, and I'm working through a lot, so thanks for being patient and kind.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Have not been NC yet.\n\nI made a plan. My NC plan. I've set up my first counselling session for next week, joined a support group for narc survivors with next intake in 2 weeks (found it on the meet up app for my area), reached out to another agency in my area that has given me more resources to contact. Will make doctor's appointment tomorrow to discuss depression and sleep issues.\n\nI'm being kind to myself with this plan. Where I'm at mentally, I'm 80% emotion and 20% logic, this is a big step for me but I still desperately want nex back. For everything I know about narcs, NC is the only healthy way to move forward and also the only way to possibly ensure a hoover and love bomb attempt. I know for my nex NC drives him nuts. \nI also know that I'm discarded because he's broken me thus I am not good supply and he's probably disgusted by my lack of confidence. To be considered \"good\" supply in his eyes I need to be strong, independent and confident in myself again.\nSo I will freely admit that in my mental state I am going NC with the hopes of drawing him back to me. But this is twofold. Going NC will allow me the space and time to heal and work on rebuilding myself. Counselling, finding my joy, being able to cope with my emotions on my own etc. So if/when my nex gets over the initial crazy of a narc injury by being ignored and realizes that devaluing will not get me to come back and the actual love bomb and hoover attempts start (because we know when the devalue doesn't work, he will ignore me right back) I will hopefully be strong enough and distanced enough to either say no or just continue with NC like he doesn't exist anymore.\nMy motivation to start may be skewed but at least it's there to start me on the right path. Essentially I'm going to gaslight myself into healthier thinking \ud83d\ude02 see I did listen and learn!\n\nThe actual steps of this plan is to treat this exactly for what it is, an addiction. I have a quit date. Saturday night. We have tickets to a hockey game. I'm going with him, it's my last \"hit\" I am going to Grey rock the entire time and throw myself into watching the game and having a good time. Then that night I will block all social media, email, texting apps, his phone number and let my roommates know if he shows up at my door to tell him I'm not available. I restricted his and all his family and mutual friends viewing access on my fb a few weeks ago and tonight I am deleting everyone but him.\nI want to reach out and send his mother one last message to say goodbye and thank you for letting me be apart of their lives but will only do this with his permission due to the nature of their relationship.\n\nWish me luck!

As soon as I knew it was him, I blocked him.\n\nOne of the biggest fights during the last moment of our relationship was that I caught him on Grindr (hgay hookup app) .AT first he said he was just checking out the app, THEN he was looking for friends (WHO THE FUCK LOOKING FOR FRIENDS ON GRINDR) and THEN he wanted an open relationship otherwise he wouldn't be happy. I asked him to acknowledge me by changing his status from \"single\" to \"in relationship\". He wouldnt.\n\nSo, after seeing his visit on my profile. It brought back a lot of nasty awful memories, all the feelings he made me feel when I was with him: worthless, unloveable, crazy and replaceable.\n\nI called my therapist today and this is what she had to say\n\n**WHY IS HE TREATING HIS NEW BF BETTER? WHY WASN'T I GOOD ENOUGH FOR HIM TO ACKNOWLEDGE LIKE WHAT HE IS DOING TO HIS CURRENT BF NOW?**\n\nHe may have perfected his crafts after being with you you. You spoke up. You questioned things. You didn't take his BS and lies quietly. It may look like he's acknowledging the new BF better but he may just be doing this to please the new BF in order to gain something he wants. \n\n**IS IT POSSIBLE HE'S CHANGED?**\n\nAnything is possible. He may have changed his MOs but at the very core unlikely \n\n**BUT WHAT IF HE HAS CHANGED? COULD I HAVE DONE SOMETHING DIFFERENT? WOULD THINGS HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT HAD I BEEN MORE PATIENT?**\n\nYou did what you did at the time you did with the information you had. Could you have let him get away with his manipulation? Sure. Could you have not questioned his lies? Def. But is that a healthy relationship? Would you have been happy? No. \n\n**WHY WASN'T I GOOD ENOUGH?**\n\nWhether you were good enough or not, it's irrelevant. You wanted the relationship to work, that's why you spoke up. He didn't. This is not on you. This is on him. This has nothing to do with you are or what you may have done and has everything to do with him and his actions. His actions are not a reflection of who you are.\n\n**I DON'T WANT HIM TO BE A BETTER PERSON. I WANT HIM TO CONTINUE BEING A NARCISSIST.**\n\nUnfortunately, you don't have control over this. You played a role in his life. You cannot control his life and cannot determine how your role in his life dictate his life decisions. Just like he played a role in your life and only YOU can determine how it should have effect on you. Could he have changed for the better? Possible but unlikely. The only thing thing you can do is to live your best life and not worry about his.

I have created all new social media but I haven't changed my phone number.. it's just unfair. Why do I have to change my whole life around, while he stays exactly the same. And I'm pretty sure even if I did change my number, he would find some other way. He always texts me from fake  numbers and says disgusting things. He lives in New York and I live in Georgia. I have tried to get a restraining order but no one takes it seriously because he doesn't live in Georgia. I spent over an hour talking to a lawyer, and all she really did was tell me everything I needed to change in my own life, rather than any action against him. I tried calling NYC police and they don't care either. He is like a disease and I just want him to leave me alone already. He bothers me and then completely acts like he never did it, as if he truly is oblivious to what he does. It is so weird and creepy.

He was 18, after some texting and phone calls, a few weeks go by and he asked me out. I told him flat out I didnt wanna have sex till I was married (I just wasnt ready and I was slightly into church at the time) anyways we go on our first date to the movies and after 20 minutes he was all over me kissing my neck touching my thigh, I was uncomfortable but it also felt exciting. I'd never been touched or desired before. The next time we saw each other I was at his house, a friend was there but after a while she went home and so we were alone. He asked me if I wanted to go into his room, I said sure as long as we dont do anything like \"that\" he laughed and said ok. I go in sit on the bed and I start talking about a comic book movie I liked, then he sits down next to me and within seconds shoves me on the bed, hes kissing me so aggressively its painful and I cant breathe. He grabbed my arms and put them above my head and was on top of me, he shoved his knees on my inner thighs so he could put his boner on me and starts grinding. He hadn't stopped kissing me, it happened so fast and I couldnt breathe. I began to wiggle away but he didnt stop. After a minute or so I push him off and roll over in tears. He got up and left me there until i got picked up. I should have dumped him that day but I dated him for another month. It just got worse from there but the problem is eventually I stopped stopping him. I hated it and I hated him but idk maybe I was just too ashamed. Sometimes it was partly consensual towards the end. And I hate admitting that. But I'd tell him all the time I wanted us to stop doing sexual things and I felt pressured and hed just say sorry. At one point I even put a cigarette out on my leg infront of him after hed forced his fingers into me. I was hurting so bad I didnt know how to express it. I just had so much shame I felt so sick. I'd cut myself after everytime we saw eachother. Idk why I'm posting this I guess I want some sort of sense that I'm not insane or alone. I know it was toxic.

I was a dumb, curious teen that grew up in a Christian household, but for the most part I thought we were just joking around. Regardless, he knew I was 15 and immediately after he dm'd me he started asking for pictures of me. I said no and eventually we got around to talking about our lives.

He would always say he needed me to take away the pain and that he was going to take his own life, especially whenever I threatened to leave or rejected his advances. He asked for pictures of my body and audio of my voice. He offered to teach me how to touch myself so I'd orgasm. When I was feeling the most vulnerable and self loathing, he offered me a place to stay. I gave in to most of his requests, but everytime I did it felt like a part of my soul was being torn away. I hated it. This had gone on for about 6 months until I ghosted him online and moved on with my life and always thought of the experience as a bad relationship. Never told a soul.\n\nEdit: Fast forward to years later, I'm 19 and a bunch of child grooming/pedophilia scandals breakout on youtube. At some point while researching, I realize that I could relate to the victims. I was never molested, I never met him in person even, but was I a victim too?

This lasted for about a year and a half. At first I didn't realise what was happening, and I thought that it was normal, since she was my first true love and first real relationship, I was blind.\n\nShe would always slap me and punch me when she got mad. She would then always tell me that her ex boyfriend was better than me and always compare me to him. She would blame everything on me. She would blame her situation that she was in, even though it had nothing to do with me, for example when her and her friends fought, she would say it's all my fault. She would never want to update a status on Instagram or on whatsapp or any social media platform of me, yet she would always post about her other guy friends. She would swear at me, calling me a f*ck up, calling me a c*nt, call me dumb and stupid and much more. She would even tell me that because I'm not white (I am a man of colour), that I cannot sit next to her or hold hands with her or walk too close to her, since others will see it as weird. \n\nShe would always manipulate me and turn the problems around on me, countless times. She once wanted to go on a date with another guy, and went camping with her ex even though she knew I didn't want her to, yet wanted me to not speak to certain girl friends of mine whom I had no special connection other than friendship with whatsoever (I lost a few best friends, boys and girls due to her). When I told her that it was unfair and that she was a hypocrite, she told me that I was insecure , immature and childish. This is just one example. She even went and got drunk one night with a guy that she said liked her. She would never ever think she was doing wrong and if I confronted her about it, She would just give me the silent treatment by blocking me and tellimg me that I have a problem and that I am crazy.\n\nI am quite religious, yet she would always tell me that the boys in her church are better than me, and that I am not allowed to comfort other girl friends if they are sad because that's what God wants. Take note these friends of mine have boyfriends. She would call me the devil and smack and kick me in my face, even slapped me while I was driving us to her house, and even hit me in my face whilst I had my glasses on.\n\nIn the end, the gaslighting, emotional abuse and feelings of worthlessness got so bad I was in a deep dark hole, which I am struggling to get out of. In the end, numerous amounts of friends came to me and told me they can see how badly she treats me and how depressed I am and how much I have changed. \n\nThey all helped me to realise that she was abusive and absolutely rotten on the inside , even though she is a beautiful girl on the outside. I struggled to leave because I was hooked, my first love, even though she would never give me real, proper love. I lied to her by not.telling her that these people had spoken to me and I had told them what she did/was doing to me. I was too petrified to even be honest with her about this, as she would always accuse me of lying even when I told the trurh in the beginning of the relationship. For example if i was with a friend that she knew (a girl) by chance to help study or something, she would avcuse me of sleeping with her. She found out that my friends knew what she was doing to me and that they could see from the outside that she was abusive and she accused me of being the abusive one, yet I have proof of everything she has done. She told me I was a liar, and a cheater, but can I be blamed ? I never spoke to anyone about what she was doing to me for a year and it killed me? I am not a liar, nor abusive in any way, I really am a soft hearted guy, yet I can admit that I lied to her about speaking to others about the trauma and how she was treating me. \n\nWe have been a month and a half no contact now, as the last time we spoke she told me that I do not have God in my life, and that the devil is with me and that's why I am so depressed, yet she left me in this deep dark pit ? She says she's happy because God has shown her how beautiful she is, yet does God even allow people like her to abuse and manipulate and do the things she does ? \n\nI have been going to therapy, and i have made progress by deleting her number, blocking her on Facebook and not having her on Instagram. Yet she has now tried to become friends with my friends, people who she always said she never liked while we were together, and people she tried to take me away from and people that she badmouthed always. She forces herself on tbem and tries to take pics wuth them, and tells them to tell me that if i see the pics I must not thonk anything of it. It breaks me, but I dont show her my reaction because I know that is what she wants. \n\nI really am struggling, and some days are better than others, but she keeps talking to my friends and lying to others about me, saying that I was abusive yet I really was not and everyone that I know and who knows me, knows the truth. \n\nI was always there for her And she used me as a punching bag as well. I picked her up at her lowest even when she treated me like utter sh*t. \n\nWill she ever realise what she has done ? Will she ever miss me ? Will she EVER have any remorse ? I dont think so. I dont think I will ever have closure as to why she still lies about me, plays victim and how she is sooooo happy yet I AM so so depressed. I will never have closure as to why I got treated so badly, yet everyone else she manipulates into thinking she is this perfect girl \n(My best friends lnow how toxic she is because she tried to break their relationships up and swore at them and threatened them too)\n\nDo people ever get what they deserve and does Karma come around ?

(I don't think he did anything to me, but I was exhausted at the time, so it terrifies me to think he might have.) The next day I told my mom in private what happened and she was upset that she was asleep at the time of it happening. So from then on, I denied his offers of massages as I already have past trauma of people touching me while asleep.\n\nBefore I continue, I want to make it clear that my mom does NOT condone this behavior, and was unavailable (either asleep or at work) during the times when he was inappropriate with me.\n\nSo fast forward a few weeks later, I've quit my job because my health was affecting my performance. Now fast forward to August. I have no job and make money by doing stuff online for other people (no not p\\*rn but if I specify, I'm afraid he may find this post). He keeps telling me that it's okay for me to be naked around him, he keeps putting his arms around me \"intimately\" while hugging me, making comments about how boys will have to watch out for me since I have big hips, and just being inappropriate randomly. I'll play games with friends, and he'll hop on and make innuendos towards me or my friends. \n\nRecently, I was having issues with my PC, so I knocked on his door and said I need help with my PC. He told me to come in, so I opened the door a bit and he was completely naked at his PC. I was too shocked to say anything so I quickly said \"I need help with my PC\" and closed the door and left. My mom and I had a conversation later on, just her and I in my room, and that's when she told me that he apparently told my mom that I came in and sat on the bed and stared at him being naked and didn't say anything, then left, making it sound like I was the bad guy. She also told me that she's caught him watching p\\*rn, interacting with webcam girls, flirting with other women on FB and in games, and comments he's made towards my friends in \"voice chat programs\" (again, no details to avoid being found out) when I was afk.  \n\n\nWe want to do something about it and kick him out, but we currently only own one working car, and he pays the big bills. We barely afford all our bills as is and we're still behind. I have resorted to staying in my room and only coming out when he's at work or if I really need to use the bathroom, which this has lead to me being uncomfortable 24/7 and not showering as often. I hate this situation and I don't know what to do.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I am not fully recovered, for there are some things that I will never get back, I fear.  It is those weaknesses that frustrate me the most.  That longing for a loving, nurturing mother sweeps over me whenever I see a mother nurturing her infant or toddler.  It is those times that I often begin to question myself.  What was wrong with me?  Why couldn't she love me?  Even though I know it was never about me, those questions still haunt me.  Those thoughts still plunge me into self doubt and depression.\nI had an accident at age eleven, and one of the results of my broken skull and spine is incontinence.  When I was under the abuse of my biological mother, the only safety I knew during those first six years was diapers.  Even now, all these years later, when I give myself \"air\" time I begin to panic.  I don't feel safe without them, and that is so embarrassing!\nThe closet door is another embarrassment!  It has to be closed.  If I wake up during the night and see that it is open, even a crack, panic takes over.  I know there's nothing in there but clothes and shoes, but I can't stop the panic.\nSo I soldier on, working through my issues with my therapist, fighting to overcome those weaknesses.  She has repeatedly told me that I may never achieve that, but not to give up trying.  I like her realism.  I can't even get the mail, because there might be a letter from my biological mother in there.  She writes often, trying to reconnect.  She always scents the envelope and I can smell it when I open the door of the house, because the mailbox is right next to the door.  That scent is all it takes to bring on flashbacks and terror.  That, I can handle.  Most of the time.\nThanks for letting me share.  I refuse to be a victim, and sometimes just writing about what I'm going through helps me work through some things.

So, I will vent this and hope that no one judges me for going from one abusive relationship to another.\n\nBy all means, I have never seen myself as beautiful. Even as a child, I would get uncomfortable at all the attention that I would get when my mom would put me in dresses and gush about how pretty I was. So, when I was in high school, I played down my looks a lot. I would wear baggy clothes and never put on makeup or jewelry. I kept to myself and only had a handful of friends. So when one of the guys from our wrestling team showed interest in me, I was very cautious at first.\n\nLet's call him, Tom, and he was 6'4 and very lean, but he had to be because he played on both the wrestling team and the basketball team. He towered over my 5'3, slender frame. For a while, things were very nice. He opened doors, we would hang out at his house or at a mutual friend's house, and everything was okay. That is until my senior year.\n\nTom hurt his knee really bad playing basketball; after that, he took a turn for the worse. He started drinking and abusing his prescription drugs. I tried to be a good girlfriend, but nothing that I did ever seemed to be good enough. He started getting jealous and possessive. I don't care what Fifty Shades of Grey says, that shit is not romantic at all.\n\nThen comes the day where shit hit the fan, Tom asked me to the Senior Prom and I was so excited. I bought my dress and got my ticket. I did all the rituals that girls do to get ready for the prom. I got my hair done, my nails done, and got my makeup done at the Mac store. It was the best I'd ever looked during my high school experience.\n\nWell, Tom picked me up in his Ford Explorer, and we went to the prom, but of course, throughout the night, he started drinking and get jealous at all the attention that I was getting from my friends and others who had never seen me like that before. He took me by the arm and demanded that we leave, only two hours after we arrived.\n\nBack at his place, we got into an argument, and I told him that I couldn't do this anymore. He got mad and was slurring his words and punching walls while yelling at me. Then he pulled out his box cutter that he used for work, put to my neck, and demanded that I stripped out of my dress. He bent me over the couch, threatening to cut me if I struggled.\n\nI won't go into detail about what happened next, but I stupidly thought that he would let me go when he was finished. He didn't\u2026 Instead, he told me that I was beautiful, and then started cutting my back with the box cutter. When I turned to fight back, he cut my arms and hands. I screamed and luckily his sister came running through the front door, coming from work. We will call her, Heather, and she ushered me out of the house and to the ER.\n\nI had several slashes across my back and arms, had to have several dozen stitches, and filled out a report. After Tom was arrested, the cops asked him why, and he said, \"I wanted to destroy something beautiful.\"\nI knew why he said that it was from the movie Fight Club and he loved that movie we used to watch it all the time.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

It was nighttime and I was asleep in bed (bunk bed with no bed at bottom, if that makes sense) and I felt him touching me. Whenever I sat up he\u2019d hide underneath the bunk. Again, if that makes sense.\n\nSo the oldest memory I have after that is maybe when I was 8. I don\u2019t know how it got to that point but he was doing oral on me? I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what it\u2019s called but he had his mouth on my private. I didn\u2019t know what he was doing, only that it felt weird and wrong. \n\nAs I got older I realized what was happening. To be clear: he never really *forced* anything, he kind of just kept asking and asking until I just said yes because I knew he\u2019d get mad and ground me or something. (Yes, I realize how silly that sounds. Believe me, looking back at it I regret a lot.) \n\nThis basically continued until last year when I decided I didn\u2019t care and just said no whenever he wanted me to do something because it was kind of messing me up. At this point I\u2019m uncomfortable when my biological dad hugs me, and I\u2019m weary of every man I see or meet. \n\nWhat gets me mad is that my mom knows that he\u2019s a pedo, just not about what he\u2019s doing. I don\u2019t understand how she can stay with him knowing that there could be a possibility of what\u2019s actually happening.

Bit of a long post so apologies, but I would greatly appreciate any help/thoughts on this. I already have some of my own thoughts, which I put in this post, but feel free to give me your own interpretations).\n\nSo this guy- I work with him, can't really avoid seeing him. Little bit of backstory to his personality - he is very insecure, and has even admitted that on multiple occasions. He does however tend to dominate conversations. He talks about himself non-stop, interrupts me when I speak in group situations, and is constantly name dropping. He sits in a really wide, open pose (comes across as rather arrogant). \nDespite this outward bravado, he is very insecure and doubts himself.\n\nWhen we both started a few years ago, we got on really well. He began to get really flirty, which was confusing as hell since we both already had partners who we are really happy with (well, I am. He seems to be happy with her, and is always bragging about her high salary of job status, but I guess you will never know!). As far as I was aware, he wasn't like this with anyone else on the team. \n\nHe started to withdraw sometime last year, after we were really good friends for a while, and it got really weird from there. There is another girl on the team who takes no bullshit, and he rarely spoke to her before. He began to act like her best mate, and started to really suck up to her whilst ignoring me (IE, discussing a party he had invited her to RIGHT NEXT TO ME, or making her art and such) When I confronted him about it, he would deny anything was wrong.\n\nNowadays, he is all about making snide comments to me, or just outright ignores me in the group chat. He does however respond jubilantly to this other girl, where I can see it. If she posts something she \nhas made, he acts as if it is the best thing ever. If I post something, it is either ignored or a one word reply.\n\nHe is also always making snide comments about my choices. I like to buy things to try them out, and if they don't work out then I sell them/return them. I did this the other day, and he came into the room with another guy at work who asked \"what's that?\".\nHe replied saying \"it's just another thing she has bought to fill the empty void of her soul\".\n\nI was like, holy shit. What a thing to say. But at this point, I was fully aware that it was projection as I am perfectly happy with where my life is right now, but I get the feeling that he is not.\n\nHe also likes to say things under the guise of \"helping me\", but when I start to doubt my own abilities because of his comments, he comes along to blow smoke up my arse and make me feel better by saying nice things. But he always has to say something to crush me first?\n\nHe sometimes (once in a blue moon) does nice things which I appreciate, like driving half an hour out of his way to pick me up and drop me off one time. I really appreciated that, but was unsure of why he did it. He had just got a new car, so it was potentially to show it off, but why go so far out of your way to do that? Especially at rush hour!\n\nI get the feeling he is a bit jealous because I am generally a happy person, but I do of course have a lot of insecurities, which he seems to target as I trusted him and discussed them with him. He wouldn't be the first narc to target me in the workplace, and most certainly won't be the last, but it is the one who affects me the most because I genuinely care about him as a friend, so this all kind of hurts a lot.\n\nHowever, because he is only like this with me, it's like no one else but my partner can see how much of an asshole he is being? If I talk about this to the other girl (also a really good friend, and definitely not a narc) she is shocked by some of the things he says to me in private, but she brushes it off as him only joking since she only ever sees a certain side of him.\n\nWhat on earth is going on here?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

If this is against the rules, I'll apologize first and hope you'd give me a chance and hear me out. I'm pretty new to Reddit and recently discovered that sub-reddits such as this exists were people share their stories and find the support they need. Today I'd like to share our story, albeit in a different way.\n\nI'm one part of an husband-and-wife team and we recently published our first ebook apps on the Google Play Store. \n\nThese apps are part of a series of books inspired by a close friend of ours, who shared with us her own stories of verbal, physical and psychological abuse that she endured since childhood at the hands of her family members. We each come from different parts of Southeast Asia, where such abuses were commonplace; depending on severity sometimes even known and considered as an inevitable, socially acceptable part of growing up. My wife and I know these well personally, having experienced some of these things ourselves, often enjoying 'legitimacy' due to their prevalence in our culture.\n\nOur friend, who had since left her family and is now pursuing her interest as a budding artist, produced a set of illustrations done in a children's drawing style, depicting situations in which she had herself experienced, or who someone close to her had experienced. We were moved by the expressions portrayed by her character and discussed about bringing her stories to the masses. We inked and coloured the illustrations, and added story text where appropriate.\n\nThese are true stories still happening on a daily basis in Southeast Asia, and we're hoping to get the word out through the app medium to bring greater awareness and perhaps help to give a voice to those still oppressed or living in the shadow of their abuses. We've published the free (ad-supported) apps in both English and Simplified Chinese versions to maximize our available audience (and because they're the languages we are most familiar with and can handle).\n\nThere are to be three books in total, and we have the first book out in both languages, and the 2nd book out in Simplied Chinese. I'm working on the English translation for the 2nd book at the moment, and will start work on Book 3 once that's done. Everything is done page by page by hand, and we're still learning as we go along.\n\nThe first book, entitled \"Childhood\", is themed around parental neglect, verbal and physical abuses, lying around strangers to maintain an appearance, and pressure from seemingly well-intentioned outsiders who likely doesn't know the extent of what they see.\n\nEnglish Version Here: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HomeStayStudios.DurianStoryEbookENGBook1](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HomeStayStudios.DurianStoryEbookENGBook1)\n\nChinese Version Here: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HomeStayStudios.DurianStoryEbookCHSBook1](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HomeStayStudios.DurianStoryEbookCHSBook1)\n\nThe second book, entitled \"Days as a Transfer Student\", is about the character being torn from familiar environment and thrown into unfamiliar territories. It explores the theme of bullying and what it does to a person's heart.\n\nChinese Version Here: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HomeStayStudios.DurianStoryEbookCHSBook2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HomeStayStudios.DurianStoryEbookCHSBook2)\n\nThe third (and final, for now) book in the series, entitled \"The Basil Diaries\", will tell a story of sexual abuse and the trauma that plagued the character in the days after, but also leaves a message of hope in the end.\n\nWe hope you'd give our stories a read, and help to spread the words around. You can find the apps under the title \"Durian Story\" (or \"\u69b4\u83b2\u6545\u4e8b\", its Chinese title), and we published the apps under the publisher name \"HomeStay Studios\". If you're on desktop, we can be found under [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=HomeStay+Studios](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=HomeStay+Studios)\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this, and we hope to have your support.

I had to beg you to get a hair cut, had to buy you clothes so that we could go on dates without you wearing your Carhartt pants full of wholes and stains. I got tired of being embarrassed by your drunken behavior at parties and eventually started to withdraw. In time I no longer felt sexually attracted to you. We fought about small things and I couldn't just turn it all off and make love to you, even though I still loved and cared for you. But, I loved you in a different way. I wanted to protect you, take care of you, make sure you were ok, you turned into another family member, like a brother but I loved you and cared for you. \n\nYou changed so much from when we first met I no longer recognized you. You used to be so fun and outgoing and towards the end you could not even join me for dinner at our friend's houses. I felt neglected, yet, I stood by your side. I made excuses for your no-shows, for you leaving before dinner without saying goodbye to anyone, I didn't want to expose you. It was all so hard for me, but you don't know that. I tried to tell you but you never listened. \n\nTowards the end I decided to engage in activities by myself and ended up falling in love with another man, who was not able to love me back. That alone was heartbreaking. Still, I decided it was not fair to you. I knew I had to let you go. I didn't want to hold you back. I tried and tried to separate but you would insist in trying one more time, and I just didn't want to hurt your feelings by telling you I no longer loved you. Things got so bad that you finally agreed to a separation, during that process you went through my computer and found my \"Reddit confessions\" you then proceeded to call me incessantly to yell and call me names, you kicked me out of the house without letting me pick up basic supplies. You never, ever, let me say a single word, to this day. You then took your time breaking every single item you knew was dear to me. Old pictures of my family.  Work tools, and equipment, kitchen gadgets, clothes, printer, laptop...every. single. thing. I owned. As if that was not enough, you posted lewd material on Facebook for all of our friend sand family to see, dirty, embarrassing details of my \"transgressions\" not happy with that,, you contacted my elderly father who lives in  another country, to tell him about how much of a whore his daughter is. Did you know you caused a spike in his blood pressure and he could have died as a result? I begged you to stop. I planned on taking my own life and when I mention that you said it was too bad I didn't have access to a firearm!  Wow! \n\nIt's funny to me that you read my posts, you knew how torn and upset I was about the whole situation. You knew I loved you and didn't want to hurt you. You knew the guy I fell for was not interested in me, and instead of ending things in a civil way you had to be evil, cruel and disgusting. I don't know who you are. You died to me that day. I mourn you because the sweet, vulnerable, caring person I thought I knew turned into a monster. That's what you are. A monster. I don't miss you. I am glad I got to know who you really are. \n\nYou are now portraying yourself as a victim. Making fun of the pain you have caused me and my family. You know what? I may have been raised by parents who didn't love me (according to your own words) but at least my third world country upbringing didn't allow me to go as low you did.  I din't turn out like you. You don't have emotional maturity to deal with your own problems. Instead you act like a 3 year old throwing a tantrum. And your mommy is always there to make excuses for your actions. Even as you were trashing all of my belongings, she was there with you but never to reprimand. No,  but to make sure you were ok. How pathetic. How pathetic. Grow up and learn hot to be a real man, momma's boy! I pity you. You made a fool of yourself in front of all of our friends. You thought you were dragging me through the mud but you dragged yourself right along. How embarrassing. \n\nEven more disturbing is fact that your family turned their backs on me. Ha! \n\nI guess blood is thicker. Even when it comes to your family committing crimes. Remember when your drunk brother had a hit and run? And a young girl died as a result? Then your mother ran to your house in the middle of the night in order to work on a story before he turned himself in? remember that? I do. He got away with murder, only being charged with a misdemeanor (thanks to your paralegal momma). Nobody in your family was appalled by that. Nope. \n\nNow, when your whore, piece of shit wife cheated on you, well, that was unacceptable. What a whore I am. They all turned their backs on me. Not one message of: \"hey, sorry about what's happening to you guys. I hope you are well\" Nope. I have no family in this country, you prevented me from accessing our house and your family deleted me from your Facebook family group almost immediately. Ok. That's the kind of people you are.\n\nI am so glad I was raised in a third world country by parents who didn't love me, because I would rather be that than to be a hypocrite like you. Your brother killed a teenage girl. Your mom helped him get away with murder and to you, that was acceptable. Ok. Now, why don't you get your head out of your ass and take a good look at yourself, buttercup!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I \n\nI happen to believe that we can potentially work through a dead bedroom situation, if there are no other major issues within the relationship. However, if you are juggling other things with a dead bedroom, that's when it gets tricky and significantly harder to manage.\n\nMy purpose of this post is draw attention to those of you who may be in relationships with clinical Narcissists. I'm not talking about your run of the mill control freaks, but a diagnosable person with NPD. If you are in this situation, I want to warn you that talking to them about your DB will not help your situation. Not one bit. I should have known better. But I guess I still had faith that the conversation might help.\n\nYou see, when you have relationship challenges like living with person with NPD, sex suddenly becomes more important. We cling to it as the only \"feel good\" left. Some of us, who are stuck in this situation, will use sex as the thing that gets us through the other mess in the relationship. Take heed, your disordered person knows this. And when you acknowledge sex as an important need of yours, they will exploit that power to the Nth degree.\n\nA few weeks ago, my NPD spouse and I went on what should have been a romantic trip. After the first couple of days with no sex, it started to get to me. After a day of lounging at the pool, as I laid partially clothed on the bed while he was hyper focused on email on his phone, I started to snap inside.I was relaxed, sexy and desperately need the connection. Later that night, we had \"the talk\". He seemed apologetic and understanding that my need for a greater frequency was affecting our relationship. I told him that his sexual apathy made me feel ugly and unwanted. He clarified by asking if frequency was the only issue. A few days passed and we reconciled with mind-blowing sex. I think it's fair to say that it was an act (from him). It was the kind of sex that makes you want more. It was not something that you can simply forget about for the next several weeks. Yet, he has.\n\nThis week it occurred to me that when you expose your greatest needs to a partner that has a personality disorder, that need becomes a usable weapon for them. They have more power over you, if they know they can simply withhold that need from you. They can control your emotions with it.\n\nI realize that people with NPD are capable of using sex as a weapon in the opposite way, as well. This may be unusual. I don't know. But  I'm curious about your stories. How has your narc used sex as a weapon?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

After the divorce was final, he started the trickle truths that led to the news that he had been seeing a 25yo he met through work. Our supposedly amicable coparenting agreement was quickly tossed aside when she moved in 2 weeks after I moved out and they wanted to start playing family and hurt me. Eventually I hit the breaking point , retained a lawyer, and demanded mediation. \n\nYesterday was mediation. He was pissed for months leading up to this. He brought the now 26yo, now knocked up, now wife after being told she wasn't welcome. Thanks to my lawyer, the mediator led off with getting me child support. Apparently there's a state law that says neither party can waive child support, as it's for the kids. She told him he would lose if it went to court. He came back with an offer to pay the kids phone bills and health insurance (which meant NOTHING, since they have to have a family plan now anyway), and car insurance when it's time. I said nah. He offered to throw in $100 a month..I said nah. The mediator came back and said they wouldn't go a penny over $350. Now I knew I was entitled to almost 800 a month, and a 70/30 split on expenses. So I listened to the mediator try to sell me, and I listened to my lawyer say he couldn't tell me it was a fair deal, and I said no. They both looked panicked, but I was never more certain. I remembered how important that exterior appearance is to him, and having read on here and researched everything I could about narcissists and their behavior, I knew they would fold. No way would they want to go to court, that wouldn't look proper.\n\nI was right, and got the money I needed. He starts paying Nov 1. \n\nThe other big issues were sticking to the agreement itself, and within that, coming to agreement on how to handle holidays. I didn't get what I wanted here, but neither did they. They decided to start with what I call the ugly divorce plan, which calls for dividing the children's holidays by alternating years,and splitting xmas break in half. Then they tried to bend it to suit their schedule, trying to get me to give them the afternoon of Thanksgiving, when his mother serves dinner, and then denying me xmas eve in favor of giving me my girls after 6pm on xmas. Then offering to let me keep them 2 days early so they could have Jan1-3. I knew there was a reason for them wanting the 26th and 27th, and figured it was so they could take the new baby to her out of town parents house without having to deal with the bad look of two teenage stepdaughters. So I turned them down. I have to work the days they offered, but I dont have to work New Year's day. And next year when they want me to bend for them, I wont.

I always had difficulty controlling my emotions especially negative ones like anger and sadness as it was so I just dealt with it by not dealing with people too much since I was so prone to getting set off.\n\nThe girl managed to get past my shell though, she\u2019d slowly try talking to me more and more she\u2019d be so nice to me and made me feel comfortable enough that over time I did open up to her. I hadn\u2019t opened up to anyone else before her. She was trying to get me attached to her, she\u2019d make me feel so important to her and she\u2019d make me feel like I meant so much to her and she knew that because I had no one else I had ever been close to it would eventually work. Eventually she asked me out and we started dating.\n\nWhen she realized I was finally completely attached she became so terrible. She\u2019d start \u201cjokingly\u201d saying things like I don\u2019t actually matter to her or that I was worthless, she\u2019d suddenly get angry at me for no reason, she\u2019d say I was overreacting if I was ever showing that I was getting visibly hurt, and then the next day she\u2019d apologize for it all. One day she\u2019d make me feel like dirt, yell at me, threaten to break up with me, etc. then the next day she\u2019d apologize and make me feel great about myself so she could do it again.\n\nThings got the worst when she actually broke up with me, she apologized for it the next day and told me I was still her closest friend and that she still wanted to hang around me so we kept hanging out. I wasn\u2019t as hurt about the breakup because it was just her being around that mattered to me and she was completely aware of it. She continued to do what she was doing and she knew I had nobody else to go to. She\u2019d call me annoying and clingy, block my texts and every social media I had and ignore me completely then take it all back and pretend it was all just a joke and that I always took jokes too seriously. It started to take a huge toll on me mentally, and when her friends would notice how much anguish I was in and the breakdowns I was having and ask her about it she\u2019d then lash out at me afterward for making her look like a bad person.\n\nOne day on one of her good days while we were walking she stopped me and told me what she was doing, she told me she enjoyed seeing me hurt, she told me she knew I had no one else but her and she didn\u2019t care about me at all she just loved hurting me. She then told me something that day that I still can\u2019t get out of my head now, she told me she\u2019d replace me by the next year with someone else she\u2019d actually care for. That\u2019s exactly what she did end up doing too, and it completely destroyed me mentally for a while.\n\nI was alone for a while but eventually made new friends that genuinely cared about me, I even got in a new relationship a year later but I rapidly became incredibly paranoid and anxious that they\u2019d all leave too. I\u2019d have panic attacks and break down because I was so petrified of the mere thought of them abandoning me too and I ended up ruining what I had because of it. My mental state got even worse for a while because I realized it was all my fault but I did slowly get well enough to stop having panic attacks regularly over time.\n\nIm 20 now but ever since then it\u2019s just been the same cycle of me being alone, attaching to new friends and becoming very close, then becoming incredibly terrified of them all abandoning me and actually having them all leave for one reason or another no matter what I try to do to prevent it. I can\u2019t shake the fear of anyone I get close to leaving and having it happen every single time reinforces my fears and drains so much out of me. \n\nI just want to stop feeling so terrified at the thought of getting close to people just to have them leave my life because besides making it difficult to feel comfortable with any friends I make it just makes it so hard to be alone now, I\u2019m so dependent on people now and I feel like I need to be attaching myself to someone or else my sense of self worth just drops like a stone and I make myself feel as worthless as this girl would always tell me I was. It makes me feel terrible about myself knowing that something that happened to me so long ago still gets to me so easily to this day.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}
{"post_id": "da5drb", "created_utc": 1569613032, "title": "Narcissist Smearing &amp; Projecting -- Thoughts Wanted", "author": "cal_394", "self_text": "Over the past few weeks my ex has dumped me three times (this was the last straw). The first time he did it by asking me to move out and then without saying anything, removing me from social media. He then created a new Instagram account linked to a YouTube channel that was all about his \"experiences with narcissistic abuse.\" There were four videos in which he described details of our relationship. I only saw two but in those I saw that he completely twisted conversations that had occurred between us, claiming that I tried to call him mentally ill in order to have him question his reality. He also talked about things in those videos that he had never told me in our relationship (like an ex he was still talking to when he and I started dating). When I confronted him about the videos, he said he didn't have any intention of me seeing them. But everyone I've talked to believes that he planted them there for me to see, so that his voice could stay in my head even if he was no longer in my life...\n\nRegardless of what the intention was, it was a huge violation of my privacy and integrity. What's worse is that he took the liberty of 'diagnosing' me with covert narcissism, saying that while I appeared different on the outside, I had all the \"same shit on the inside\" as his narcissistic exes.\u00a0\n\nWe tried to reconcile after that but he never really apologized for the videos or what he said, and he continued to voice his belief that I'm a narcissist. We talked about trying to find a couples therapist but it never happened. Either way I think he believed that getting us into couples therapy would reveal to me \"who I really am.\"\u00a0\n\nHe told me that I'm controlling and manipulative, and that the reason he was jealous and controlling was because I was provoking his jealousy-- if not deliberately then on some subconscious level. I know myself well enough to say that that wasn't my intention in any way. He considered this to be another instance of me gaslighting him.\u00a0\n\nHe couldn't stand that I had male friends, but instead of admitting to this, he said that he didn't really mind except that I threw it in his face to make him jealous. In particular he was angry because two days before his birthday I asked if he would be uncomfortable if I went to a concert with one of my classmates who happens to be a guy. He berated me on text for the next three hours, telling me things like \"stay the fuck away from me\",\"I can't let the abuser be the one to help me\", \"there's a lot of pain in your love\", \"the part of you that tries to make me jealous is an ass\", \"who I love needs to be fixed\", \"you're the most dangerous person in my life\", and \"I was fine before and after you, but now I'm not the man I was.\" He accused me of trying to \"triangulate\" him with other males so that he would be jealous and become even more codependent on me, of \"grooming\" him by telling him I loved him too soon and being kind to him only so that he would be subordinate. He said that I was grooming my male friends so that I would have a new source of narcissistic supply lined up in case we broke up. He also claimed that I was trying to convince others that he was abusive, and that I was using his kids on social media to these ends. He said he feared that I would abandon him and take away everything that's his. That I would \"butter \\[him\\] up only to destroy him from the inside.\"\n\nI knew he had issues with jealousy because in times past, he had questioned me a lot about my dating history and almost never went out with me anywhere. When we did, he would either notice or imagine that other guys were looking at me which pissed him off and made him question whether I enjoyed the attention. A few times he claimed he saw me checking out other guys at the gym and the pet store. I never did any of these things and it was really confusing to me because often I didn't even remember there being guys around me during those times.\u00a0\n\nToward the end I noticed he actually tried to gaslight me. He'd make \"typos\" in his texts that would make me look twice but I didn't take the bait. When I didn't react to the typos he got annoyed, which he expressed through emojis. When I confronted him about the purpose of the emojis, he only said \"I don't know.\"\u00a0\n\nWhen he broke up with me the third time, he wasn't explicit about it. He texted that he \"knew what was going on, it's so scary\" and threatened to contact the police if I tried to reach him again. He then blocked me from social media and put me in touch with one of his friends so that someone else could facilitate the move (I had moved in with him over the summer).\u00a0\n\nHe won't let me say goodbye to his kids which is really painful because I got close to them and loved them, and they were attached to me and loved me too. He said he didn't want to explain the breakup to them so chances are they'll probably think I just disappeared.\u00a0\n\nThe self criticism is like an addiction. I keep finding myself googling his Instagram handle, and I see where he comments under posts about narcissism, saying how he can relate because of me... I know I shouldn't keep looking but I guess when you miss someone you look for ways to feel like they're still with you, even if it's traumatic.\u00a0\n\nAnd in spite of all of this I still love him, or at least I love the illusion of who he was before all of this came crashing down, and I don't want him to be ill or unhappy. It's hard not to believe that I caused it all despite the evidence, because it was an argument I had initiated that led to the break up. I guess I was tired of feeling like a hostage with his commitment but still, I pushed it... and I wonder if I just hadn't picked that battle, whether I would still have a family.\u00a0", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He\u2019s sick and quit his jobs while he\u2019s been here. I\u2019ve seen him using what looks like a dating app and anytime I asked him about cheating he\u2019d rage and tell me he can\u2019t be there for me and how dare I accuse him (I was just asking). I\u2019ve had experienced with narcissistic men before and while I\u2019m not a professional he shares many similarities. He\u2019s odd and cruel at the flip of a switch. The 7 months we\u2019ve been dating have been a roller coaster. He\u2019s weaseled his way into every corner and crevice of my life. The only reason he\u2019s here is because he claimed he was being abused which I now really don\u2019t know if I believe. He\u2019s extremely immature, and tried to walk out the other day when I was fed up with his passive aggression. He says now he wants to be with me but I\u2019m not getting anything out of this.

I just left a CN I was with 6 years a few days ago after verbal/emotional abuse of my teenager and me and sexual abuse of me that went on for years. I've been gone 3 days and he knows where I am. I contacted the local DV shelter today, but they said bc I'm not in immediate danger and have a safe place to stay, I can't stay with them. He and I have a young child together, who is with me. He was already manipulating me as I was leaving. After telling me I was lucky he didn't hide the car keys from me and stop me from leaving, he then bombarded me with \"where is my child going to be tonight? I need to know where he is. Are you going to let me say goodbye? I'm not going to let you leave unless you promise to call me tomorrow so we can work out when he's coming back.\" Obviously, I see through this as manipulation, but I feel like I'm fighting an uphill battle here. I couldn't deal with contacting him until I talked to my therapist, and she told me not to contact him at all and not to even look at his messages. So I haven't, bit he's calling more and more frequently. It went from twice the last 2 days (I have no idea how many messages he's sent me, I haven't looked) to twice in the past hour, along with contacting at least one of my family members (they know not to respond). I know he's going to use my child as a way to manipulate everyone, by using his 'woe is me idk why she left I was the best bf ever and now she's keeping my child from me' crap. The problem is... I'm trying to fill out a parenting plan to send him so he can either agree to it or not and let it go through the courts. But the only thing that counts here is physical abuse and sexual abuse *if* I reported it to the police at the time, which obv I didn't. I can't get an injunction, I can't ask for supervised visitation or anything less than shared parenting it seems, ntm having nowhere else to go and worried about him just showing up and trying to take my child and convincing any police that show up to let him. I wouldn't be able to file the parenting plan til Monday and ofc now he has a house and an income and I'm staying with family and have nothing, so I feel like he has *all* the power here. I have evidence of the verbal/emotional abuse, but nothing else. I feel like I'm trying to stop my child from living with our abuser and instead of having help, everything is against *me*.

It seemed normal for a year and a half, but in a few days it will be two years, and I believe I'm in this kind of relationship.\n\nEverything we do is something he decides; from what we eat, what we do with the day or weekend, who I spend time with, what we watch on tv, etc. If I make a suggestion it's shut down or put into a box of maybes if it's something he commonly chooses anyway. If I disagree or want to spend time somewhere else, or even doing something in another room it causes him to have a horrible passive aggressive attitude for the next few hours or he immediately demands that I return to his side with no time to finish what I'm doing or sometimes even start what I planned. I had stopped writing and doing art for a long time until recently, and now I'm constantly being told that I seem like I don't like him or that he is annoying. \n\nWhen there is an argument, he decides when it is resolved. Usually  he is satisfied when I fold and not only understand his point, but have agreed that \"I would feel the same way if...\". He also gets extremely defensive, angry, and impatient if he says something that hurts my feelings and I express it. He often says \"I was joking\" but I know this isn't usually the case. It doesn't make him consider what he said or why it hurt me, he just becomes volatile because he feels uncomfortable when I'm sad. He implies that me being sad makes him feel bad and demands that I go back to being happy immediately, otherwise it becomes an all-out horrible argument. I have chronic depression and when I have an episode it deflates his mood and he will also behave the same way until I feel guilty for being a burden on anyone for existing. \n\nI'm so exhausted and I've expressed that I don't feel validated or that I have any room to live my life. I left back in June, but came back under very well-defined boundaries with expressed personal needs, but he went back to the same shit within a month. I'm made to feel stupid when he's irritable, and in his opinion everyone I used to associate with or talk to is a bad influence. I'm isolated and frequently in trouble or fearful of his anger if I make a wrong move or make plans that haven't been approved (which nothing involving my friends is ever okay). I love him but I've lost myself and a number of friends through this. Honestly, don't have another option for living arrangements because I have to stay in this county/state for probation I'm serving for a weed charge. My family and friends all live in another state, only 40 miles away, and I've tried requesting a transfer, but it's not in the cards currently. The apartment is in his name and I know that simply being roommates after a break up has been tried and failed, with the result coming down to me leaving or getting back together. \n\nI'm at a standstill, because every time I voice my honest feelings about the way he treats me, I end up apologizing for hurting his feelings in order to appease him. I'm not even allowed to have a job unless it's in the same workplace. Visiting my parents is a whole different sort of ordeal on both sides. I don't want to be watered down or live by someone else's expectations of me anymore. I no longer have the energry. I wrote this hours ago, but have been hesitating because he got home and has been ranting which needs my undivided attention since 1pm.\n\nThanks for reading, could use any validation, correction of error, or advice.

One of the agreed upon terms was 50/50 custody of the children. It didnt last long she began violating terms and soon filed for full custody citing abuse. Throughout this process she was abusive to me through text. It would cause me anxiety to hear the text notification on my phone. I never engaged and when I did respond I was always civil. Part of this is cause I knew text could be used as evidence. The other factor is I discovered she was a narc and thrived in confrontation. The biggest factor however was I was scared. You cant argue with someone with no empathy they will take things to a place no decent person would. I countersued for full custody. My evidence was enormous. Someone logical must of told her she'd probably lose, she dropped the case asking to keep things as is for the children's sake.\n     She lives with her mother who is the master Narc. She has an extensive record for drugs and is an evil person to be around. She would regularly call my nex a bitch and on one occasion got into a fist fight with nex sister. Soon after that nex sister tried to commit suicide. It is truly a toxic environment for my kids. My name is continually in their mouths they constantly talk bad about me. The children are allowed to do anything which makes it difficult when I discipline them. Its difficult but I figure all I can do is damage control my weeks hopefully when they get older theyll see the truth. I have my kids enrolled in therapy and I take them to their appts.\nThings seemed to be getting alright, which was an accomplishment.\n      A few days ago I recieved a text from my ex stating wtf is going on. My daughter was depressed at school. Teachers were concerned and they recommended therapy. I immediately called the school. When the teacher called me she seemed suprised I had reached out. I asked how my daughter was she said she had a good day and only incident she had was a girl tried to take her item the previous day. I didnt tell my nex of the conversation any confrontation with facts is useless. Following week recieve a notice from Nex for an ex parte court hearing. She wants sole custody due to a cps investigation on me.  The court date is the next day. Prior to court I go to see the school principal he is unaware of any issues has a meeting with the teacher and she states a few occasions she has said she misses her mommy but the teacher is aware we're divorced and thought this was normal. Next day we have court I was a little worried cause it was a substitute judge. After 2 minutes with only a business card from CPS and allegations, the judge dismisses the case but tells her she may file again with our judge who will be back next week. Strangely after the court session CPS worker contacts me for appt says I can come into her office. I invite her to my home. I have a clean house, kids have their own rooms, fridge and cupboards are fully stocked as they always are. Claims against me are I make my daughter shower before dinner and sometimes dont feed her till next day. I lock kids in their room as punishment. I dont let them watch television. All these allegations are false. I show caseworker my court evidence against mother which is astounding. Case worker said investigation will take a month and I can request results which will take another month or two. Im positive nex filed this false report. Caseworker referred to me as a name only her family calls me, not my government name. I swear it's like my nex has a happiness detector on me as soon as I start feeling happy and healing she pulls something like this. I'm so over it, I just looked on court website it seems shes filed a plea again.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

However, one recently slipped in during an otherwise tumultuous and vulnerable time. She became a band member in our band.\n\n Eventually we realized what was going on and made the decision to let her go. It was that or end the band.\n\nWe rode the wave as she lashed back, claiming ignorance, playing the victim, doing her best to blow things up on the way out the door.\n\nWe lost one band member who left just after her. They were friends. We saw it coming.\n\nBut then came the questions: What happened? Why was she let go? Can we invite her back?\n\nAnd the statements: She's always been so nice. (Note of interest. When you are a female N in a male dominated area, love bombing works wonders. A giggle and a toss of the head and you are good as gold. Frustrating.)\n\nAnd all you can do is suck it up and keep repeating the official line, a reason that was true but the most benign of all the things.\n\nSo the remainder of the band still thinks she was so nice and didn't want to go. They have no idea the nastiness she was up to...\n\nAnd you gotta let them believe it.\n\nOn the one hand is the N who will make life worse if you ever say anything about her or try to defend yourself.\n\nOn the other hand you have people you consider friends, in some cases good friends to whom you can't explain. If they haven't been there they can't understand. \n\nTry to explain and you are taking the risk of coming off as the difficult one, the troublemaker, the over reactor blowing it out if proportion.\n\nWe've explained to one member who appreciates the difficulty of the situation and knows us well so he knows we wouldn't speak on something like this lightly yet his experience with her is still that she has always been nice. \n\nHe did add that he doesn't know her that well and the relationship they have has never been tested by conflict. And honestly, I think this is as understanding of a response as I could even imagine yet still ...he doesn't see her.\n\nIt won't help to tell him the things she said about him, that just makes a person look petty especially compared to the N who has already established herself as the poor waif victim who was treated so badly against her will.\n\nIt's so frustrating. It feels so lonely. \n\nYou have to deal with all the crap, you can't say anything and you have the effects of the N lingering through the things you can't speak about.\n\nIt's like they retroactively taint even things they had nothing to do with just because of who they are and how they act.\n\nHow do you cope with this?\n\nHow do you deal with the invisible wedges that they leave behind, keeping you just a bit more separated from the people you care about even well after they are gone?\n\nThere is always that question, that wondering.\n\nI guess I have to resolve that it doesn't matter if anyone believes me or not, I don't need their confirmation or understanding to know what I know and what I experienced but dang it makes you feel separated sometimes.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Also, just wanted to add some notes to the one liners for why it is the way it is. Maybe we can just keep one liners I don't know. Notes below:\n\n\\[0\\] Normal people usually do not demand respect. They just leave the table if it is not served. They don't go on starting wars with people for not receiving the due respect.\n\n\\[1\\] Because there brain has created this warped world where they can't be wrong. So if it's obvious that something wrong has happened then it must be you and must be held responsible for it. That's gaslighting.\n\n\\[2\\] Hence the need for controlling people.\n\n\\[3\\] This is my opinion and not backed by any research. Take it with a grain of salt.\n\nI think we all cannot see the mistakes that we do but we can easily see the wrongs done by others\\[a\\] but then how do we realize our own mistakes? While realizing mistakes or wrong doings on our part we are actually empathizing with other people, our ancestors, religion, animals, nature, anything you could empathize with but narc's don't have circuitry to empathize or its completely underdeveloped so they can't see their own mistakes.\n\nTo be able to change one has to take a good look at his own self from point of view of others, admit the wrong, forgive oneself and move on. That's how people change and grow and narcs don't.\n\n\\[a\\] This is also why it's so important to analyze the feedback given by others. I used to go on fights with people who would point out my mistake. Not anymore. I realized admitting mistake is far harder than defending our own ego.

Admittedly we agreed to stay together but after it became apparent to me that he was stalking me at every opportunity, trying to catch me out etc I found the courage (with the help of some friends) to break free.

The final straw was him turning up at my house while my mother was dying of cancer in the living room, completely high on meth saying he wanted to \"start over\". He asked if I loved him, I said no - and besides, how could I? Only a few days prior he had said that I deserve my mum dying from cancer and that he hopes I get aids and die. Finally a good friend texted him and said if he ever comes near me again then we will look for a method to deport him (as he confessed to me his immigration documents are forged). \n\nIt took a few months of being by myself in my new job, starting everything fresh but gradually over time, looking after myself I have bounced right back. \n\nThe test for me was when I concluded that he must have been married to someone else, his \"flatmate\" that I never met, the whole time we were dating as they now have a kid and they seem to be co-parenting. \n\nI had no feelings except that I dodged a cannonball. \n\nSo, fast forward to now....

I keep getting flashbacks and I just want it to stop. I want to know if I was abused or if i became part of some sick incest??\n\nI am not sure exactly how old I was when it started, but my guess is maybe 11 or 12.  \nIt started as a game with my older brother, myself, my Cousin J and my Cousin L. We where playing fort in my room under my bed ( I had a bed with a ladder). Me and L would take turns in sitting outside of the fort making \" food\" and other stuff while my brother and cousin J would be in the fort all of the time. After a while it was my turn again to be in the fort my with my brother and Cousin J, but this time something changed - I don't remember how it changed, but all of the sudden they would take turns grinding on top of me (dry humping me). They told me it was part of the game, that I should lay still and not say anything to my cousin L, because they didn't want to do this with her - I remember it made me feel special and included, but it also felt wrong. I was the youngest of the four of us and I hadn't experienced a lot of the world yet since I was shy and didn't have many friends at the time.  \nI remember at one point when one of them was on top of me, my cousin L looked in when she wasn't suppose to and she got this weird look on her face and my brother and J was in a small bit of panic. I didn't understand the problem They stopped the game then and neither one of us ever talked about it again.\n\nFor the life of me I CAN NOT remember, how it all started again if it even stopped?? but my brother came back. There wasn't really a conversation about it, it just kept going. We would play in either mine or my brothers room and he would start grinding on me again. - I remember being confused because we weren't playing the game as before, but my brother told me it was a different game that him and I could play, but I couldn't tell anybody about it. Not friends, mom or dad or even my cousins, It was to be our little secret - I again felt special, because I now had a secret with my brother that I looked up to.  \nAfter the first few times he started to ask me if \"mine\" had \"tickled\" yet. I didn't understand what he meant a first, but after a while I did. He would dry hump me, my private parts would tickle and I would like it and then feel bad and confused about it because I didn't know what was going on with me. I never asked him what was happening when it tickled, because I was embarrassed that I didn't know and I also didn't want it to stop. So it went on for a time, how long I don't know, but it stopped once he got a serious girlfriend.  \nI have no memory of full intercourse, so I am not sure if that actually happened and if I just blocked it out? But other things did happen. We kissed a lot, dry humping in different positions, he went down on me, he rubbed his penis on my ass (skin to skin wanted to push it in), rubbed my clit a few times and I touched his penis once.\n\nTo this day I am not sure if it was some sort sexual abuse or if i wanted it? I remember I liked the feeling I got when he went down on me, I liked the kissing and the feeling I got when he was on top of me, But I also remember feeling scared and weird about it all. I couldn't understand why I wasn't allowed to talk about it with anyone. I walked around thinking it was something all brothers and sisters played and that maybe I was just being weird about it.  \nToday I know that it wasn't normal and I feel angry at my brother because he took something from me that I can never get back and I am not sure he even remembers? I am angry at myself because I liked it and I feel like I should have known better. I should have stopped it or said something to my parent, but I didn't.

Eddie was Jason's (my stepdad's) and his sons' dog before. When they brought him to our house, he was skin and bones, but I've been the one taking care of him and all the dogs. \n\nSo anyway, Jason picks up our adult dogs by the scruff of their neck when they do something wrong and throw them outside. Eddie screams in pain, and Jason screams, \"It doesn't hurt! It doesn't hurt!\" I try to explain to him that they're adults, so it's very painful for you to do that to them, and even if they were baby dogs out in the wild, the mother only picks them up in dangerous situations. My mom always calls that arguing and yells at me. I never get a chance to speak :(. And i try to text her. But i feel like she reads the first part and says, \"Audrey, you better stop arguing. He's the adult.\" \n\nAnd yes, I KNOW he's the adult, but I did research on the topic and i feel like I have a valid opinion. The other day, Charlie started fighting with Eddie. Charlie was alone before we got Lucy and had no interaction with other dogs (which was our fault) so he fights with Eddie a lot. He used to fight with Lucy, but she stands her ground. So yeah, they started fighting and Jason grabbed Charlie by his COLLAR, not even his scruff, and held him up in the air and screamed at him and THREW HIM ACROSS THE ROOM. I had to sit there and watch. I didn't say anything and I walked to my room.\n\nAlso, Eddie wears a shock collar because he barks too much. My mom said the shock collar was off and it was just there to make him not want to bark, but IT'S ON. Every time he barks, a little light on the shock collar turns red and he lets out a little yelp. And as the kids in the house, we're not allowed to take it off. My 15 year old step brother, Joey, took it off one time and I watched Jason scream at him. All the kids in the house secretly agree that it's very inhumane. \n\nI talk to my sister about stuff like that and she has the same opinions on it as me. Jason isn't abusive to us, but he does yell a lot. It seems like you could say one thing wrong and he'll blow up. \n\nOne time Jason came in my room and turned my light on. My window was open and you could see everything perfectly without the light, and I have a hamster, and hamsters like darkness. So I told him, \"Can we keep the light off? Creampuff likes it dark,\" and I turned the light off. And he immediately stormed off.\n\nWe DO NOT get along AT ALL. My mom thinks I'm not taking him seriously when I smile when he's yelling at me, even though I told her it's so I don't cry. Im a sagittarius and he's a cancer who for some reason hates animals??\n\nYes, I admit, sometimes I am really disrespectful. Mostly because he starts arguments about the littlest things and I defend myself. And he just takes everything so personally. He really wants me to seem him as more than just a stepdad, as a part of my family. My mom changed her last name to his, and she gave me the option to, like a good mom :), and I refused. So did my sister. If he keeps acting the way he is, I'll never seem him as a part of the family, even if he is.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Advice needed to fix it...", "author": "kaylajenner", "self_text": "It has taken me nearly 2 years to come to this realization. These tendencies only started to reveal themselves about a year into the relationship. I tend to be the person to give second, third, and fourth chances to people because I know I\u2019m not perfect either. But I suppose it has shaped into me becoming a pushover when it comes to him because I prefer no conflicts and give him the benefit of the doubt that he will change. I don\u2019t expect it overnight and he has proven to communicate better, but there are occasional slip ups, and it\u2019s been so long that the N behavior hasn\u2019t completely left. Here are some concerns that built up over the years that I need to accept as truths to his character so I can maybe move on, but advice is always welcomed too:\n\n\u2022 our first big fight was during black friday shopping. he came home with me to my parents house for the weekend. earlier that morning my old high school friends wanted to meet very shortly since we hadn\u2019t seen each other in ages, and since my bf went to sleep late from the drive home, he was still asleep when they came, and I didn\u2019t want to wake him up. I asked ahead of time if he could come because I wanted them to finally meet him, but another friend also asked the same thing, and the group collectively decided since it\u2019s a short and quick hangout that it\u2019s better for it to be just the original friends so we can catch up fast and go on about our day. Since he was still asleep, I went out to the mall with them for about an hour and came back and he had woken up. We ate and I drove him and my little sister to go shopping at a bigger and better mall an hour away. On the ride there, he was talking to a close guy friend in korean (his native language) and I assumed it was just a casual convo. But it wasn\u2019t until later that I noticed his change in attitude. He was blunt, clearly annoyed, and acting defiant to my attempts to ask what\u2019s wrong. I made my sister go to a store and browse while we talked outside the mall. Then he went off on me, yelling at me that I disrespected him to such an extent that he saw me as the lowest-level of a person, he can\u2019t bring himself to respect me anymore, and can\u2019t believe I wasnt smacked by my parents earlier. I realized too late he was pissed at the fact I went out with my friends without him, and I didn\u2019t blame him for that. It must have been shitty for him to wake up in my room wondering where I was in a home that wasn\u2019t his, and I felt so bad I did that without thinking it through. I apologized sincerely over and over and explained the hangout situation. I admitted and affirmed that I should have fought for him to come because he\u2019s a visitor and I shouldn\u2019t leave him alone. It was my honest mistake to assume he would sleep in longer. Clearly, he felt excluded and unwanted, and I didn\u2019t realize it would impact him so hard. He started to call my friends shitty people for acting exclusive, and said if he ever saw any of them he was going to beat the shit out of them, and that I should never ever talk about them, bring up their names, or let him see their texts pop up on my phone of he would get pissed all over again, and he\u2019s shocked bc his \u201cfriends would never do that\u201d. Of course, I know my friends are NOT shitty people, and it was never intentional to hurt him like that, but yes their actions might have made him feel disregarded, and I won\u2019t overlook that fact. (I brought it up to them much later and they felt so bad). I apologized as much as I could, but he kept claiming I wasn\u2019t aware of the real reason why he\u2019s angry and Ill never know him well enough. Is this gaslighting? He also said how he was calling his friend in the car, basically shit-talking about me in korean right in front of me as I drove. He said he expects my friends to somehow contact him and apologize without me telling them to do so, otherwise he would continue to see them as shitty people.....? I don\u2019t understand how I can tell them without TELLING them...???  He kept dissing me and yelling in front of other passing mall guests, and I felt so small. I totally agreed that he had a right to express his anger and what I did was very inconsiderate, but the words he said and the yelling I felt were too out-of-proportion to the larger issue. He kept saying he doesn\u2019t want my apologies, so I was confused asked him what is it that he wants then, and I never got an answer. He was trying to be self-righteous and peg me down as hard as he could and say hurtful words, and I really thought we were going to break up then and there. I apologized more and walked back in crying...  \n\n\u2022 he got really defensive once when I brought up him picking up a little (basically a person he would become a mentor to in his co-ed frat). I was talking with my friend (who barely knows him, but knows lots of people in his frat) and i mentioned him picking up. She casually said \u201cWait... he\u2019s picking up a girl?\u201d in a tone that made her sound like she knew something I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m not extremely close to her, so I didn\u2019t ask her what she meant by that, and I wish I did in retrospect. I got suspicious and anxious and asked him straight up during a small argument what his intentions were because my friend made it sound like he was doing some under the table shit, and he felt attacked and angry at ME. I said I didn\u2019t have any idea what she was alluding to, hence why I asked him directly in order to cut out the bs and get an answer. He wasn\u2019t doing anything shady in reality, but I noticed that since he felt cornered and painted in a bad light by my friend, he got extremely defensive and started to openly hate on her for making him look bad (note she\u2019s not the type of person to make drama out of nothing). I understand why he might\u2019ve gotten defensive (because who likes to be questioned?), but the extent to which he did alarms me. He made me call her right then and there in the car (I never even called her before bc we really weren\u2019t THAT close), or else he wouldn\u2019t get out of the car and threatened he was \u201cgetting really pissed off I\u2019d accuse him like that\u201d. Then his voice got really scary and he kept threatening to find her and beat her up if it was true that she was trying to start rumors and shit. I reluctantly called her, and she said it really was nothing and she wasn\u2019t aware her tone was off-putting. I felt so awkward after. Seeing him like this shocked me because I never saw him as a physically abusive person. He has never laid his hand on me, but has smacked the wall many times when we have heated arguments or he loses a video game. Weeks later when we were reflecting on the situation, I told him if he ever lays a hand on me, we are done for good, and he calmly said he would never, and he would work on his anger management issues.\n\ntl;dr \u2014 my boyfriend can act out of anger in a way that is far too explosive and out of proportion when he\u2019s defensive or feels threatened that other people don\u2019t see him in a good light", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He told me that he was seeking support in the wrong places and bonded with a few of the women over being divorced (which is a lie on his end). He did not choose separated on the profile, he deliberately chose divorced.\n\nThis is my first official post. I\u2019ve been married to my narcissist for 6 years and we have a toddler. My husband has tried to pressure, coerce, and threaten me about sex from the beginning of our marriage. We sought help after the first year and things got better for a couple of years (not totally but a lot better), but after having my daughter, the abuse has slowly crept back in. I believe my husband has a sexual compulsion that he will not recognize and the narcissism plays into it big time.\n\nBack in the beginning of the summer, we had an explosive argument late at night in the car in the garage when he would not stop pressuring me about sex and stated calling me names. It got to a point where I told him I wanted to leave and get space and got in the drivers seat of the car. He grabbed our daughter out of her car seat and said he needed to cuddle with her when I asked him where he was going. He knew I wouldn\u2019t leave without her. He ran into our guest room with her and locked the door. I asked to come out but he refused. Being concerned about how he was using our 2 year old against me, I called the police. They helped deescalate the situation and my husband agreed to put my toddler down to sleep in h crib (it was 11:30 by this point). He was downright rude to the police though and lied when they asked him if he had ever hurt me before (he had a couple of times over the years but I hadn\u2019t reported it bc it hadn\u2019t occurred to me). \n\nThe next day, he started blitz texting me about how he knew I was trying to ruin his reputation and he wanted a divorce ASAP, harassing me for my DL and SS numbers and telling me i wouldn\u2019t need money for expenses bc id live with my parents. He stayed in a hotel for 3-4 days and would text me when he felt like it and would demand an answer right away but wouldn\u2019t respond to my texts. I don\u2019t really remember how the ordeal ended, but it was like so many of our other experiences, he finally huffed home and I intermittently sweet talked him and scolded him for what happened. I think he came back bc he has threatened divorce dozens of times and uses it as a manipulation tactic. If we went through with divorce, he wouldn\u2019t get what he really wants\u2014control and sex, and family too, I guess.\n\nWell anyway fast forward to a week ago, I found out that he created dating profiles the very day that he was blitz texting me about divorce all day. We have been very explicit about what we consider to be unfaithful behavior in marriage\u2014and that would be anything before a divorce is official. I gathered as much evidence as I could to understand what had gone on. He \u201cliked\u201d over 100 women\u2019s profiles, messaged 10-20, asked out 4, and had in depth conversations with 3 women, setting up a date with one of them. His use of the sites was sporadic but I could tie a few of the times he used it to days where he had tried to pressure me into sex and failed, leading to an argument.\n\nNow I know the betrayal could have been much worse, but this has really torn me up inside bc he said he was looking for support in all the wrong places. He was looking for emotional connection from strange women online at a time in our marriage when I have been begging for scraps of his love. Lately, it had seemed like he was mainly interested in spending time with me for sex and little else, which had left me feeling used. We\u2019d have great outings with other people, but when we were at home, he would withdraw into his \u201cman cave\u201d until he was ready for more affection. We did have a wonderful anniversary trip away from our daughter last month but things went back to \u201cnormal\u201d within days of returning. \n\nI\u2019m also hurt that he told me he thought of the 100+ women\u2019s dating profiles as a game, like \u201chot or not.\u201d It\u2019s real to me! when I asked him if he had been looking at porn, he scoffed and said he didn\u2019t like that bc it wasn\u2019t real. My guess is he felt like the online profiles were a no risk way of putting feelers out there and getting an ego boost without actually following through with dates and crossing physical boundaries. But after everything he has put me through over the years, this does seem almost as devastating to me as a legit affair. He had crossed so many boundaries but I never in a million years thought he would cross this one. \n\nNow that I know everything, I\u2019ve been all over the map this week. At first I was livid, rearing for divorce or at least a significant separation, totally done. But the next day he stare texting me, sending me pictures of our little family and throughout our relationship. He said he loved me and would do whatever he could to save the relationship. Never mind the day before when he lied when I asked him if he had messaged any of the women. I would\u2019ve never found out the truth had I not pulled a loose thread and thoroughly investigated. I believe he is sorry\u2014but that it\u2019s bc he got caught. He even told me that he tried eveythimg he couldntobdelete these profiles over the past few months. Great, more evidence of his deceit.\n\nI\u2019m going to spend the next few eeekw at my parents\u2019 house while I try to wrap my head around what I should do next. It\u2019s so hard bc he\u2019s like Jekyll and Hyde. Now he\u2019s being all nice to me and saying he realizes he made a huge mistake. But he is still resistant to recognizing his behavior overall as being abusive. I can tell that he really does want our marriage to work out, but I think he wants it to be on his terms and comfort level.\n\nI know that\u2019s a lot. I usually avoid writing things like this out bc I\u2019m afraid of what I\u2019ll see when I\u2019m done. But this is therapeutic.\n\nSo right now I\u2019m in a fragile place of figuring out my next steps. I\u2019m honestly tempted to stay. I cling to the many good times we\u2019ve had (it\u2019s been 50/50) and keep thinking maybe someday it\u2019ll be 75/25. I also have his voice in the back of my mind from a few weeks ago saying he knows his behavior is my fault bc he never acted like this before we got married.\n\nI am very slowly coming to the realization that I can\u2019t fix him, I can only fix me. I do tend to get fiery in arguments (I can\u2019t help but defend myself when he verbally attacks me). And I also struggle with nagging too much. Any recommendations for resources on how I can address these concerns? I know it won\u2019t fix him but I need to grow in that area for myself.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

This person was generally quite a bitchy guy in general. They used to ring me up and ask me a lot of questions about my life, particularly when I was going through rough spots or they knew I had just gone through a rough spot - like someone had died, or I'd lost a job, etc. Anyway, I have encountered people like this before who come out of the woodwork and pretend to be sympathetic, but seems to get off on hearing all your problems and you can tell they're enjoying it and only pretending to be sympathetic as they're usually not very good actors. This \"friend\" was like that. But they were also weird in that they would do this for a while, then suddenly get really angry with me and say things like \"Well, I can't help you!\" or \"Why don't you go talk to someone about all that?\" Really annoyed with me all of a sudden, like I had just rang them and was bothering them with my problems, looking for sympathy. But they had rang me and pried all this stuff out of me. It was so weird, they'd just flip in the middle of the conversation and reverse things, making it seem like I was bothering them or seeking sympathy/attention, when I had actually not been telling them my problems at all, until they kept pestering me and trying to find out more information about my current woes. It was so weird and it used to leave me feeling really bad, like shit. Made me question myself - was I looking for sympathy? Was I telling them my problems? I'd have to remind myself they were the ones who rang me.\n\nAnyway, I never quite encountered this level before. Is this narc abuse? Is this a specific type of thing that is known? As I said, I've encountered the people who pretend to care or are nosy or what have you. but never came across this before or since. It's like, if they didn't want to know my problems, why keep ringing and probing to hear the problems, then flip out and act like I'd told them unsolicited?\n\nHas anyone ever encountered this?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

In the beginning it was a bit slow, long talks,\u00a0 a bit  hesitant  even for a kiss the 2nd date so I asked and she decline, I  respected  that. I would drive 45 min to see her several times a week.  The  preceding months were like lightning and it all went uphill at 1000   miles an hour, kissing, sex, compliments, everything about me was   perfect to her, 2 months in she said she wanted to tell me she loved me,   5 months in she wanted me to marry her, I was on cloud 9, everything   was so good, we were so tangled together, but then she started pushing   \"I am going to be too much for you, I am too crazy, everyone leaves me,   she started crying in her car randomly and said she wasn't good enough,  I  am too good for her.\" Every time I constantly reassured her I am not   going anywhere, she would apologize every time and say, \"Good, I am in   this for the long haul.\"\n\nConstantly telling me I will leave her because of her issues\n\npushing me away then apologizing and thanking me for being understanding\n\nBeing   happy through text, then meeting in person she is just a husk of a   person unmotivated and doesn't want to do any plans we made\n\nrejected   physical or ignored physical gestures (Hugs never reciprocated, kisses   were half assed 90% of the time, never showed me any affection)\n\nextreme   lack of emotional support for me, while I poured hours into asking her   to explain herself so I could help or be there for her\n\nmanically cleaned apartment then depressingly destroyed it days later, didn't feed the cats for 2 days or more out of depression\n\nconstantly   degraded herself and out make small digs at me when I didn't  understand  something or questioned something she would say \"You really  think you  are going to be good at X career with that thought process?\"\n\nisolated   to the point of being scared to go out and refused to go out half the   time we would go to the grocery store excited then get there and she   would just want to immediately leave\n\nkept  pushing marriage on me  even 6 months into the relationship and telling  me how she wants to be  married in 3 years and kids soon (Her own dad  told her she should  probably stop asking so much)\n\nshe  would judge my progress in  school as \"I am farther than you and I  think you are just going to  resent me or get lazy because I am  farther.\" (Which I don't get at all, I  didn't care I started later than  her)\n\nwould constantly tell me   \"you can't deal with me, I am not worth it, you will leave me, you don't   understand me, you can't understand me.\" (I tried my damnedest to be   there and hear her out)\n\nwhen we  would talk she would zone out  from our conversation and just start  talking about what she wanted to  talk about or ignore me\n\nlived  in a fantasy world of TV shows and  Disney concept of relationships  (The man is the one in charge and he  needs to do most of the work) when  we discussed marriage a bit after I  said I would like an option with  the marriage things she said (This is  my wedding I am the woman, if you  don't like it then we aren't getting  married)\n\nrefused to let me move in unless we were engaged or married completely out of the blue when that wasn't our initial plan\n\nwould shut me out frequently and not talk\n\nwould   give up on almost everything, even last week she \"gave up\" on school   and failed 3 quizzes in a row because she didn't care anymore\n\nshe   talked about suicide multiple time as glorifying the idea of being  dead  she took frequently more Xanax than she should have and laughed  about  it, took more sedatives than she should and alcohol together and  just  said \"If I woke up, I wake up oh well,\"\n\nconstantly degraded everyone around her calling them stupid, idiots, ect,\n\nafter   her medication dose up and her PTSD flair up we didn't engage in any   sexual activity for 3 or 4 months and she wouldn't even let me touch her   as she said \"I don't want any guy touching me, even you right now,\"   (which hurt)\n\nimpulsively buy  underwear and things she really  didn't need, maxed her credit card and  has ruined her score and is  paying high interest\n\nshe  complained about \"zero romance\" but  every time I would ask to do  something she would refuse it, no plans, no  physical bonding, but then  complained about we don't do anything...\n\nwould   starve herself for days because of didn't want to get fat while I was   by her side trying to make her food or dinner and trying to get her to   eat and she just refused a lot of the time\n\nChristmas  we got a  tree and started to set it up (A small one) halfway through  she got  frustrated, gave up and just laid on the couch for hours not  wanting to  talk or deal with anything\n\nnever really seemed excited for me when I achieved anything at the gym, school or just dealing with my own issues\n\nwould   CONSTANTLY talk about her trauma and say she is good and fine but then   almost immediately fall back into her pattern of self destruction,  lack  of awareness and spiraled backwards even when she did I was still  there  tell her she did a good job and trying to motivate her, but then  would  follow that with, Her personality just seemed to be her PTSD and   Bi-Polar.\n\nWould look on pintrest  24/7 and equate quotes and  motivational tags to our relationship and  see if they added up to them  to compare if we were doing ok or not.\n\nHow  many times I sat there  asking for her attention, putting my hand on  her hand, her leg or  anything and not getting any reciprocation of  affection back or even  acknowledging my presence. Was it really that  hard that you never said  you are glad to see me when I walked through  the door in the 1.5 years  together, to never hug me or kiss me walking  into your little apartment  world?\n\none  of the most hurtful things that happened was when I  asked her to put  her homework down so we could enjoy a show together or  just BE together  for a moment in time, she said, \"I can multitask\" I  asked her if we  could just be present with each other for a bit and she  just declined  to give up her preoccupation. That dug into my soul really  hard, it  felt like my emotions were just totally insignificant and my  presence  was second best to her.\n\nAfter all this, I still cared and tried to support her through everything and it still hurts...\n\nWe   had good moments of conversation we had and sometimes we cuddled at   night and talked, we enjoyed the gym she more or less enjoyed running   more though. We were eating properly together through myfitnesspal for a   bit and we talked about school a lot since we are the same major and  at  times she did have some awareness of herself and it made me feel so   happy she was doing good and was noticing her cycles.\n\nBut  then,  she at times didn't tell her therapist all of her issues, didn't  take  her medication all the time, sometimes refused. I had to put my  foot  down at one point and tell her, \"either you go to your therapist  and get  back on medication or I am leaving,\" and she did, but then she  slowly  started falling off again.\n\nShe  said we mainly broke up because I  didn't know how to deal with her  PTSD/bi-polar/borderline and that she just put  up her walls and stopped  trusting me after awhile because I made a  mistake once or twice or  didn't see things from her perspective. As I  set there asking and  trying to get her to let me understand about her  illness so I could  help she just said, \"Why do you care now, why didn't  you do this  before.\" I told her because I actually have a perspective  onto what  went wrong and what I can do now, she just said, \"Yeah, too  little too  late, I feel nothing for you anyway, it is completely gone  and never  coming back it is like a switch.\"\n\nMind you during all of this conversation she is smiling ear to ear texting a guy from tinder...\n\nSome key quotes as well:\n\n\\-  She flat out said this to me when I  was saying I want to work on what I  did wrong in the relationship,  \"What if you mess up in 30 - 40 - 50  years?\"\n\n\\- \"You can't emotionally support me.\"\n\n\\- \"I gave up trying and communicating long ago.\"\n\n\\- \"I wanted to be with other people when we were together.\"\n\n\\- \"I want to be with someone who doesn't know my mental health history and never tell them.\"\n\n\\- \"I built up my walls against you, I never want to try again and let them down for you ever again.\"\n\n\\- \"I thought school (Psychology Major) would teach you how to deal with me.\"\n\n\\- \"Why do you want to change now, you should have done that 8 months ago.\"\n\n\\- \"You think I am heartless, I went through the breakup months ago, that really hurt too.\"\n\n\\- \"I am not far into treatment, I am insane, no one should be with me.\" As she is somewhat seeing a new guy now.\n\n\\- \"I know I live in a fantasy world.\"\n\n\\- \"I forced myself to live without you and I don't want to try again.\"\n\nShe   then went on to say that she shouldn't date anyway because she is too   much, she isn't even in a good place in her illness journey to be with   anyone and that she is too fucked up and is too much work. Then she  just  giggles and said her medication is doing great that she found an  extra  bottle of xanax and sedatives she has been taking in excess and  feels  great. (I messaged her mom last night and told her about that)\n\nThis   all feels like a fucking vivid nightmare, someone so sweet and loving   turned into a completely distant and hurtful person, this isn't even  her  anymore.\n\nI always listened to her and never degraded or held her illness against her and worked with her always.\n\nI   made a few mistakes, when she went to the hospital I didn't go see her   (I still feel terrible about that) and we didn't really celebrate   Christmas or our anniversary together. I got a bit distant with her in   her depressive episodes and I will admit I did not have the skills to   deal with her emotional swings which she faulted me for not knowing how   to help her. I did start coming around a bit less, because her moods   would bring me down.\n\nWere these things that bad that we couldn't repair the relationship?\n\nI   am just so hurt and a bit guilt ridden that I ruined everything here   because of some of the mistakes I made. She also wanted to get married   in a year and I asked if she could wait like 2 years and she decline   (maybe I should have just done it sooner then?) I just don't get it, I   stayed when she went off meds, got hypo, drank, neglected herself,   animals, me for the whims of her selfishness or the lows of her   depression and me being there for her and helping her with everything I   possibly could being there to reassure her I wasn't ever leaving her   through bad or good, always trying to be emotionally supportive,   physically supportive, when she wanted to complain about her job or X   thing I always listened, when she degraded herself I was always building   her back up, making dinner for her when she didn't want to, always   driving her places, helped with rent, groceries, cat food, complimented   her physical appearance when she felt disgusting, reminded her to take   her meds, helped her with homework and her computer issues, grounded  her  when her PTSD popped up when she was sleeping and having a bad  dream I  would wake her up and hold her, kissed her forehead when she  would get  migraines or to be extra affectionate, always was respectful  of her  sexual boundaries and requests, I even pointed out her possible  Bi-Polar  as a possibility instead of Borderline, stood by you when you  pushed  and pushed being the anchor for you as you would apologize and  say \"I am  in this for the long haul.\"\n\nI  thought this was going to be my  last relationship, she said it  multiple times that it was for us, even  during the breakup she said,  \"You have been the best boyfriend I have  ever had in every aspect of a  relationship ever.\" Then she walks out  without a fight or trying to fix  anything...", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I am a guy (emotional and sensitive), who has a younger female friend in the 'grey area' of relationships. She is social, chatty, sometimes vulnerable, sometimes rude and not lucky in love. Boyfriends change oftenly in her life, but I try not to overstep this boundary. Ever since moving to the town where she lived for some time, we did meet several times and had a friendly night out once. I did not think about anything bad during those moments as she described her relationship status as 'on a verge to an end'. We did not openly flirt (I know that she acted premiscous previously and set a mental boundary for myself years ago) during the night, however she did ask me whether she missread my sygnals or was there an interest from my side. I answered 'No' (as a guy I felt a little trapped in this situation) and she replied with 'Great, then'. We met after a few weeks again and randomly walked in town, then suddely she spelled that she split with her boyfriend after an argument because he did not understand how she can spend a night out with other guys when they are still dating. She did not put a clear blame on me and said that it was her ex-boyfriend being 'stupid enough to be so jealous when they were about to quit the relationship anyway', however I felt a package of negative emotions inside of me (guilt, stupidity, shortsightedness, low morale, self-blame..) during that moment. We ended up the meet up calmly, yet I felt overly confused and shaken inside for the rest of the day. We did not meet for months after this and I accidentally found out that she was dating another guy. It was quiet for a long time and suddenly she contacts me again just several days ago. I checked her FB wall and she seems to be preparing for a another split according to the posts she shares about 'men being weak', etc. She suggested to have a walk in town and drink wine/coffee. I suddenly remebered what it may lead to and excused myself from not spending a night with her in bars. It feels like I am used as a reason to end up romantic relationships and boost her ego/confidence prior jumping to another adventure. When 'all is fine', she is busy and non-available.

He touches my feet or my legs even though I tell him I am very uncomftable and makes comments abouth how my posture is important and I will get saggy tits and stuff like that. Even though I am 15 he puts my feet in his mouth and if I complain he says when I was a baby or a kid I didnt complain and I should stop making him out to be a pervert or a pedophile.

She never really worked due to anxiety and I was supportive in that regard by not pushing her to work. I think of the money I make as equally ours; I let her control the money without a fight because all I ever wanted was love and respect. After years of taking the emotional abuse, I've become so stressed out that I went into a deep depression for a long time. I became abusive to some extent myself as a way to cope, by which I mean i tried to isolate myself in video games and did the \"silent treatment.\" I also didn't work for a year of that, so we relied on family for a place to stay.\n\nNow we both own the house we are in. Her name is on the house too.  It used to be my mother's house, but she wanted to give me an inheritance before she died so she said as soon as the house is paid off she will hand it over.  I had a little over 10k saved up at that time so I discussed it with my wife and we agreed to pay off the remainder of what my mom owed. Despite our mutual agreement, all I hear is how shitty our house is and that she wants to move somewhere with better schools for the kids. I want to fix the house regardless of what we do; but she just \"want(s) a better house,\" even if we do end up staying in the same town. Even after telling her how that makes me feel insecure when she says that, she still does it.\n\nShe doesn't discipline the kids at all other than by yelling over and at them so I feel like it falls on me, but since I'm the only one who tries they see me as mean.  After all, mommy let's them do X so daddy must just be mean. The worst part is that often it's her asking me to make them behave and they still say I'm mean while she's nice.\n\nMy middle child once followed her (as kids do with their mother) as she went to get up off the couch to grab a remote and literally shoved him out the way and made him visibly, yet silently cry. I got mad and scolded her as I held him to comfort him. She said \"i didn't push him that hard,\" which is untrue. Then she asked him if she could hold him and, of course, being a small child he didn't hesitate to reach out for her. She then said, \"see he's okay\" after apologizing, but it wasn't a real apology because she kept brushing it off.\n\nDuring my depression stage (which I have always constantly struggled with even as a small child myself) she threatened to cut me off from the money that only I work for. She often buys foods or snacks that are \"for the kids\" or \"for me (herself)\" and when she runs out of her own sweets she'll eat all of mine too despite her claims that she doesn't like my snacks very much. I'm not much of a sweet toothed person and I'm a naturally giving guy so that's not why it bothers me. It's the blatant disrespect and inequality I feel from the principal of it.\n\nIt got to the point where I stopped wanting sex and, for a while, she would make unwanted advances and essentially rape me using shame and guilt as tools.\n\nWe've come to the point where we talked about separating and decided to try to work it out and to her credit she has made some significant changes, but it's too little too late. I want to just be friends, as she said she would always want to be friends and she's the mother of my children. I'm no longer on good speaking terms with my mother (she's very unstable and emotionally abusive as well), my brother doesn't have room for me even though I think he would still try to accommodate me or help me somehow, my dad and grandparents on his side live too far from my work, and I have no other family or friends that I'm close to. I contemplate suicide, but I don't want my kids to go through that.\n\nI'm bisexual, but lately have been coming to terms with my attraction to men. I was born and raised in the south and still live here so I grew up hearing my own family and friends say terrible things about homosexuals, not knowing they were talking about me too. Even people I work with and care about (in a nonsexual way) are homophobic. I dabble in history and politics so one day I was watching a documentary about Saudi arabia where they talked about killing homosexuals and my own mother said, (paraphrasing)  \"that's why we shouldn't allow arabs to come here, because they do these horrible things for their satanic religion...but then again we should be doing that (killing gays) here.\" I was speechless. I still can't describe just how bad that felt to me. The homophobia has always been relentless in my life.\n\nMy mother grew up in an all-around abusive household and, I suspect, we both have severe adult ADHD, so it's not surprising she had also been abusive at times. I see a lot of her in me, but I'm aware and not in denial so I have made significant progress on my own; though, I still really need to see a mental health professional. I can't afford to. I have no insurance despite working in a good trade. My mother won't even entertain the idea of her being mentally ill so there's nothing I can do there despite her having decent insurance. I know because other people tried just to have her blow up and completely deny it being a possibility. I don't even know where she lives now. She sent me two weird and random letters in the mail, both missing a return address. I know she lives less than 20 minutes away and my brother has been there, but now he also doesn't talk to her because when she babysat for them she fed them junk food (my brother and sis in law are very conscious over the food they eat) and lied about it numerous times. My mom also apparently thinks pantsing is a suitable punishment.  It's sad to say, but I'm relieved to not have to be around her. She's my mother and I care about her....i guess that's what my relationship with my wife has come to.\n\nI could go on and on if I had the memory to recall everything at once.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

Grace and boundaries. Meaning, if they were envious of you for something, they'd just silently stew and keep it to themselves. They might then use that envy as motivation to go out and better themselves in some way. But they would never attack you for their envy. They would never overstep boundaries. They wouldn't go after you, because they had enough self-respect and shame to know that that's not the classy or acceptable thing to do. \n\nThe narcissists that abound today have no self-respect and no shame. There is no low they won't stoop to when they're envious. They *will* come after you and they *will* try to tear you down. They *will* sabotage you. There is nothing off-limits to these people. It's this astounding sense of entitlement that exists today, where people think, \"I should have that. You shouldn't have it. Therefore I'm entitled to take it from you, or at the very least make your life a living hell as punishment for bettering me\". There's no real thought in this. There's no self-restraint. It's simply, \"I see, I want, I take\" as the Little Shaman of YouTube puts it. \n\nI also think that this lack of boundaries and willingness to go to any length to win, has a domino effect of its own. If you know that people will shamelessly try to take from you whatever happiness or success you've gained for yourself, you're going to be more vicious about protecting those assets, because you have to. Therefore you're going to turn into the same guarded and untrusting type of person who's targeting you in the first place, for your own survival. \n\nThe bottom line of all this is that protecting and preserving relationships and the integrity and honor of other people has gone completely out the window.

We've been divorced for more then a year now, and I am  noticing many co-workers have changed how they interact with me since the divorce.  I've found ongoing evidence that anyone who is able to listen to her will be subject to a smear campaign directed towards myself.  She is also pushing herself into relationships with people I work closely with.\n\nThe no contact/grey rock approach has been working.  I alter my break times/lunches so that I can very easily avoid her.  Despite this, I am worried of being 'hoovered' by her by way of using her child as a pawn.  \n\nThe child is not biologically mine, but we forged a strong bond in which my ex-spouse reacted jealously to - except when she posted about the relationship on social media, which was likely to harass the child's biological father.  The relationship between the child and I was instantly over the moment she moved out with him.  \n\nI blocked the ex-spouse on all social media, as well as the child's social media accounts, since the ex has access to them and likely uses them to spy on me.\n\nI am actively looking for a new job, which somehow she has found out about and has been talking about it with upper management at my work.  \n\nHow do I act if she brings up the child to me somehow?  I miss him a lot, and I realize there is no active way for me to have a positive relationship with him if he is still living with his mom.  Do I just flat out ignore her if she approaches me, especially at work?  \n\nWe live in a small community and I am introverted, very quiet, with little friends.  It kills me that she has chosen to slander me to people that I work with, when I gave her everything she asked for in the divorce.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

These two friends have tried to pursue me many times even after I\u2019ve rejected them they didn\u2019t stop. They ramped up the gaslighting, the isolation from everyone around them, the manipulation, and just made me feel like I hated myself. These two had a long history together and they did get involved sexually, but one of the others took advantage of him by getting him drunk and high. This same person also tried to take advantage of me drunk and high but I rejected him.\n\nThis guy was pissed off at me and kept accusing me of things like being homophobic and immature just because I rejected him. He tried to pursue me several more times before I blocked him on everything and he went completely crazy and started stalking me. He basically painted me out to be the bad guy despite what he was trying to do.\n\nThis other guy assumed that me and this guy did a couple things which I didn\u2019t. He developed a crush on me and started telling everyone around him that I was gay. He tried to make a couple moves on me and the more I rejected him, the more he isolated me from everyone as well. He made a fake profile on a dating website and I just found out recently it was him in disguise and I revealed some details about myself that I\u2019m not comfortable with him knowing. I feel so violated and disgusted at this point.\n\nBecause of these experiences, I now have developed some serious c-ptsd and my depression and anxiety have skyrocketed. I haven\u2019t felt the same because of the behavior of these guys. They were basically trying to manipulate me into doing things with them even though I had rejected them and told them I wasn\u2019t interested. I don\u2019t know what to call any of this. Is this a form of sexual abuse? I just want to process what happened so I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m completely losing my mind.

Tell me I'm doing the right thing by leaving.", "author": "jusmaxxinnrelaxin", "self_text": "These groups have been tremendously helpful to me. But now it's my turn to post something because I need to vent. And like most of you I've been separated from pretty much everyone that I care about. So I feel like I am all alone and have no one to tell. And it's embarrassing to tell my story, so I don't want to rekindle old relationships when they already told me before that I was getting involved with a \u201cpsycho\u201d.  Yes, that's exactly the word that almost everyone that was previously in my life said to me about her. \n\nI'm an American who had been traveling back and forth to Central America to explore starting a business. I met my hopefully soon-to-be ex-wife online. I met her in May of 2018. We quickly connected and she quickly engrained herself in my life to be my partner in Central America. Of course we had all the typical narc and co-dependent relationship symptoms. I wanted to save the world and she was the person who was going to help me do it. She quickly learned me as I tend to open myself up too quickly. Of course we rushed into sex and we rushed into committing ourselves  to each other very quickly. More or less at her demand. I got rid of my best friend at the time because I dated his sister-in-law briefly. and by September of 2018 my Nex had contacted every woman that I've ever dated that she could find proof of in Facebook or social media. Her typical course of action was to start arguments with them and get them upset and get them to say negative things about me. That information would be used against me for the remainder of our relationship and used against me to guilt me into things and used against me to coerce me into following her demands. It was a combination of triangulation, manipulation, and blackmail. It was a strange whirlwind to say the least. All the red flags were there. Unfortunately this is not my first trip on the Narc train, but I ignored all the initial signs, and somehow I still got caught up in this craziness and continued the relationship.\n\nBy mid October of 2018 I had moved to Central America full-time because I was laid off from my job here in the US. She and her three children were living with me. Now keep in mind that she didn't have a job, so of course I had been paying for everything up until that point. But I had a great severance package so the money kept flowing. The fights and manipulation continued with us, and in an effort to gain some control of the downward spiral and to \u201cwin\u201d her trust we got married legally in December. That was actually a huge mistake because once we were married she actually became much worse instead of becoming better. The arguments became a thousand times worse. The manipulation,. the false accusations, the lies, the invented stories, the drunken rampages, the mental and at times physical abuse were unparalleled. I even was finding myself pressured from contacting my own children very often because she would twist my actions and  accuse me of talking to my 1st ex-wife (a marriage of 11 yrs). The concept of co-parenting was completely lost on my Nex and for her the only acceptable relationship with my 1st ex-wife was to have no contact, which I just couldn't do because we still have 3 teenage children together. \n\nBy April 2019 I was starting to admit the reality and recognize what I was dealing with. At first I attempted to stay calm and try to almost greyrock her and have no expressions to her outbursts and try not to reply to her nonsense. But she would stall me out for days at a time until she got the supply and the reaction that she wanted from me. Often after her provocation, when I would finally explode she would video record me and use the recordings as blackmail against me to show everyone \u201cwho I really was\u201d. \n\nExample. One day we were out with some of her family members and we were drinking. Usually I'm not a person to get drunk but this particular night was the culmination of three days of her passive aggressiveness and provocation to fight and I couldn't take anymore. Since the rum was flowing freely that evening eventually my emotions caught up with me and I started to have a complete meltdown in the middle of the living room in front of quite a few people. Of course she started to play the victim which just pissed me off more. I threatened her, which she recorded and used that to Blackmail me that she was going to take it to the police. No one wants to go to jail in a third world country. As I come to find out that was a fruitless threat because they tend to not take domestic violence very seriously. By the way I never actually hit her. I did threaten and we had some pushing and shoving which was mutual and I was restrained by her cousin. However,  it certainly wasn't the most physical altercation that we've had,and she has been much more violent toward me in private than in that particular situation. For me that was the beginning of the end, because I'm not a violent person, and I don't believe in hitting women. I didn't want to be perceived as that guy. That's when I realized that I was losing control of my life. All the while I was unemployed and very depressed about that. \n\nFinally fast forward to June of 2019 and my dad said he wanted me to come home in August to help him for two weeks after his surgery. That's when I devised my plan to leave. Fortunately at the same time I had started an interview process with a company that would bring me back to the United States. When I left in August I packed a bunch of my stuff with me and I gave her the excuse that I thought I was going to have a job so I needed some things in case I needed to set up a residence in the US. Fortunately all that came together, I got the job, and I have not returned back to Central America. We've had some pretty large fights while I have been back in the US.. Most of them are extremely stupid. For example, she has no idea how large an IKEA store is. But because my phone was in my pocket and I didn't have signal for a an hour, She accused me of cheating with someone that I had met here. And to top it off, said it in a post on Facebook and tagged me.  Now keep in mind that I live in a city that I've never lived in before. I know one person here who was one of my fraternity brothers from college 25 years ago. I haven't even tried to meet anyone new, because I want to be faithful to my relationship. The story was completely unfounded. I just wanted some cheap Swedish furniture because I was tired of sitting in an empty apartment. Honestly in retrospect, I escaped.  I didn't just leave, to take a job. I feel like I escaped because I had to create a plan to leave, and a plan to support myself and a plan to not have to return. I came back to the US with almost nothing. But Im safe again.\n\nSo now we come to yesterday we had another very stupid fight, and I said to myself enough is enough. I sent her a picture of myself when I was leaving to go to the store. Oh by the way, any time I leave my apartment she wants to know that I'm leaving and wants to know when I return and at times wants pictures of me when I'm out and about. Personally I believe it is because she wants to see if I'm by myself or if I'm really where I say I am. She denies this but I think we all know the truth of how they operate. So yesterday when I ran errands, I had a short sleeve button down shirt on,  which supposedly \u201cisnt normal for me because usually on the weekend I wear polos\u201d and she accused me of getting dressed up to go look for women and I wasn't just going to the store. Now this is the same woman who puts on full makeup, tight jeans, and high heels to go out to the store.  But somehow for me it was \u201cdifferent\u201d, and therefore I was doing something untrustworthy. This shows the extent that Narcs study their targets. Or maybe she is projecting what she actually does when she goes to the store\u2026..  Anyways,  like i said yesterday I reached my limit (again) and I have blocked her on everything except for email. I refuse to talk to her except through email and I have told her that she will be hearing from a lawyer in the next few weeks because I want a divorce. This is actually the third time that I've asked for divorce but with your help and encouragement, this is the last and final time. I feel like I have to have some contact with her to finalize the divorce and to wrap up the lease on the house that I have in Central America that ends in December. But honestly I've even considered just walking away from everything that remains there because it certainly will have no impact on my credit here in the United States. However, I do want to have a clean record if I ever pursue business in Central America. Not sure what to do on that one.\n\nSo my ask for all of you is to reassure me that I'm doing the right thing.  I think just talking through this has reassured me a little bit. You all know once she started to figure out that I was possibly gone for good it, has been a full Hoover. And she keeps telling me how much she has changed. But in moments like yesterday her truth comes out. She hasn't changed and I don't believe she will change no matter how nice she's being in the past few weeks. \n\nAnd since I have broken contact with her, every few hours I get these long emails about how much she loves me. But I don't believe it in my heart. I have told her that I don't see how she truly loves me when she treats me like this. I have told her that jealousy and control and envy and comparison of past relationships doesn't equate to showing love. I know I just need to keep my contact extremely limited or go NC and cut my losses. I\u2019ll have to ride out whatever smear campaign she has planned for me. In the year and a half, she has intertwined herself into becoming mutual friends with 134 people that I was friends with on Facebook. I have shut down my account but I'm sure at some point she'll have an angry outburst and do something with all the \u201cevidence\u201d that she is collected against me. I can't let this be a deterrent for continuing with the divorce. I'm just going to have to accept any fallout happens as a result of the divorce. I'm sure she will have lots of lies and manipulation in store. Thank you Reddit for listening I just needed some time to vent.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

This years game starts very soon and I have been dreading it all week. I won\u2019t see her but I cannot shake the ANGER and anxiety. I don\u2019t want her to get her way AGAIN. She always did. It was always about her. \n\nShe lied to me throughout (I realize now); used me and others for vacations, gifts, money, contacts. We went around the world together because I loved \u201cher\u201d. I realized now that person doesn\u2019t exist but she used me over and over.\n\nThen she slept with her ex while I was away for work, blaming me that she was lonely and making it my fault. \n\nThe final time she used me was for football tickets and I told her to never speak to me again. \n\nShe\u2019s since called and text me a few times since we broke up 3 weeks ago, mainly because she chose to go she the Saints instead of keep a promise to me.\n\nNow they are playing again and I KNOW she will not be concerned at all about the year of pain she caused.\n\n\nI will never go back, because I\u2019ve realized how little she contributed, that she\u2019s not really good at anything and isn\u2019t as attractive as I thought. Another post here today said the same thing and if I see a picture of her I feel no attraction. I fell in love and was attracted to a fictional character. \n\n\nI will not reach out, but I am so angry that I am in real pain and she probably hasn\u2019t thought twice, even after all this time. \n\nI know she\u2019s damaged, and I hate that I care, but I just want her to feel or realize how badly she hurt me and feel some responsibility for the sleepless nights, significant weight loss, missed opportunities and emotional damage she caused. \n\nHow do you cope?\n\nThank you again, it\u2019s changed my life", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He\u2019s funny and charming and charismatic. But not in a gross, pompous way; he has a quirky, self-deprecating charm. You\u2019re attracted to his humble self-awareness and his openness and ability to accept responsibility for his faults. Within days of meeting he is sharing stories about how he has been hurt, and you feel a pull of empathy for all that he has been through. He is dynamic and fascinating. He is movement and life in colour. You feel more interesting for knowing him.\n\nHe adores you now. You are everything he wants. He has waited so long for someone just like you. He is everywhere. Texts on your phone when you wake up and before you go to bed, and in the middle of the night (just to let you know how happy he is to have met you). All your free time is now spent with him, long conversations every night and getting together whenever you can. And the sex. My God, the sex. No one has ever desired you like this man does. Sex as soon as you walk through the door of his apartment, and then twice more before you leave. Long kisses and holding hands and ignoring the rest of the world as you gaze into each other\u2019s eyes.  It\u2019s better than a romantic movie. It\u2019s bliss. You are literally dizzy with happiness. He is consumed with you, and you with him. Nothing else matters but this perfect love. When he tells you that you are his girlfriend you hardly notice that it wasn\u2019t a discussion. This amazing person has chosen you when he could have had anyone.\n\nAnd then he starts to disappear. Slowly at first, an unanswered text here, a terse reply there. Seeds of doubt are planted. An ex-girlfriend is back in his life. A family member doesn\u2019t like you. But he is still so into you, and so sure that this was meant to be. You start to feel like something is off. You can\u2019t put your finger on it; he\u2019s still saying everything you want to hear. When your friends ask how things are going, you don\u2019t know how to answer. \u201cThings are\u2026good,\u201d you tell them. You are now certain that you will never meet anyone like him again. You feel uneasy as you think about how with every passing day he seems less certain about you.\n\nHis moods become your moods. On the days that he likes you, you are on top of the world. You are smiling and chatty and assured. When he is cold to you, you draw the blinds and shut out the world. You stop just looking forward to his texts and start to depend on them. The ding of your phone is your lifeline. You\u2019re not sure what happened, but you feel uninteresting and unexciting. You\u2019re not enough for him. Something is chipping away at you. You feel more and more worthless. It\u2019s him making you feel this way, it must be. But how? You can\u2019t figure it out. He says all the right things. He reassures you. No one loves you like he does.\n\nHe\u2019s gone most of the time now. He\u2019s cancelling plans and telling you that you have become a chore. You are sure that it\u2019s over. But he pulls you back with promises and assurances and plans to make things better. He tells you that you make him want to be a better man. He feels like he is not enough for you. Him, perfect on his pedestal so high that you can hardly see him. You wonder how he could ever think he isn\u2019t enough. He is everything. He gazes into your eyes and tells you that he\u2019s worried that you think what you have isn\u2019t real. He holds your hand over his heart and tells you that you are his. He tells you not to give up. You won\u2019t. You never could. And then a few days later, he is gone again.\n\nYour conversations with others start to revolve around him. He is all you can think about and is all you talk about. The first time you come to them in tears they are empathetic. But as the days and weeks and months pass, they are becoming tired and annoyed. You see it. You know they are avoiding you. You start to become more erratic. You are desperate for help, but when you try to explain what is happening you sound hysterical and dramatic. They don\u2019t get it. And you can\u2019t explain it. You start to pull away because you see the emotional toll you are taking on everyone else. He is empty and he is draining you, and you are doing the same to them. You realize that no one can fill up the void that he is creating inside you anyway. You isolate yourself. Now it is just you and him.\n\nYour mind is foggy. Thoughts about how things seem wrong drift just out of grasp. Being consumed with him is normal. You can tell by his messages whether it will be a good day or a bad day, but you stop caring either way. A good day today just means a bad day tomorrow. He is calm and cool and always in control. This is all normal. He never questions what happens between you, and when he kisses you and tells you that he is so, so happy to be with you, you believe him. You are sick. Anxious and depressed. Sleep-deprived. Lonely. Isolated. But you have him, and that is all that matters. Or does it? You remember that there was a time before him when you didn\u2019t feel this way. A time when you wanted to get away from him. But that is hazy and you can\u2019t remember why you would ever not want to be with him. When people tell you that you deserve better, you can\u2019t really figure out what that means. He is everything you want. What could be better?\n\nAnd then one day, he is gone for good. He can\u2019t make you happy, he tells you, and so it is over. One text. One text to end an entire relationship. You crash. The first few days you panic. Your hands shake and your head rushes and you throw up. Then come the feelings. Back to back, changing from minute to minute without warning. Crying so hard it feels like you might sob out your soul. White hot rage that makes you lose control of yourself. A rush of euphoria that makes your head spin. Then back to tears. Cycling minute by minute for days and weeks on end. You\u2019re sure you\u2019re going crazy. You are more exhausted than you\u2019ve ever been. Your friends are telling you to get over it, to be glad he\u2019s gone, that you\u2019re better off now. They don\u2019t get it. They don\u2019t understand how you need him like you need air. That without him you have no idea who you are. That you don\u2019t exist if he is not in your life. That you are in pieces and you don\u2019t even know how to start putting yourself back together. Or if you want to.\n\nAnd then the crashing waves start to subside a bit. The fog ever so slowly starts to clear. Life is gradually coming back into focus. He is still all you think about. But you have questions. You imagine him standing in front of you. How many hours did you spend looking into his perfect blue-green eyes to see if you could sense any warmth behind them? How many times did he give you that smile that was just a bit too polite to be genuine? Why, when you think of the way he looked at you, can you only picture disdain and contempt and haughty indifference? You become a detective looking for clues. Reading back through old text conversations you can\u2019t find a single time when he asked you about yourself. You see all the right words, but the compliments are shallow. The discussions are superficial. It is all hollow. Just like him. It is a shell of a relationship, just like he was a shell of a person. You realize that you are now empty too.\n\nTime goes on. He stays gone. This is the longest he has ever stayed away. You do what you are supposed to do. Exercise, counselling, friends, work, hobbies. But you are still waiting for him to come back. You learn all about what he is. And you know that your relationship couldn\u2019t have gone any differently. It wasn\u2019t designed to last. It was set up to fail, to leave you empty. You know this. But still, you wait for him. You feel yourself becoming stronger. You start to smile again, then laugh for the first time in a year. There are moments, the first ones since you met him, that you are truly happy. But still, when you wake up in the morning, you wonder if that will be the day that he reaches out. The fog is still there. You are moving on with your life. But, like an automatic reflex, when you do something new you want to tell him. You still wonder, \u201cWill this impress him? Is this the thing that will make him find me interesting?\u201d The fog is still there. You hold your breath when you get a message on your phone, half hoping, half fearing it\u2019s him. You tell yourself that you\u2019re wiser now and that you\u2019ve moved on. You\u2019re too strong for him now. You would never be in that situation again. Day by day, you are becoming healthy and confident. But he isn\u2019t blocked on your phone. The door is still open. And the fog is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the comments.

I remember things were better before my dad died in 2002. My mother remarried in 2004 to someone who I despise. He's always been loud, derogatory, nasty and so on. Between the two of them, I've not had a normal life. There's a lot that has happened that some of it I know was abuse. Mostly the few times he did anything physical. He'd often corner me anytime I did wrong,  scream, and then proceed to get angrier and say that my tears were fake and for attention. Put a lighter to my foot, put welts on my body and then lied to cops, pushed me out the door and nearly hurt my back( CPS got involved, but I was too young to really understand why they were talking to me every week). Between him and some other things going on at the time, I blanked out and somehow sliced my arm open near the mid arm. Had told me and my mom to lie and say I fell while hanging a curtain, refused to drive me there, leaving me to drive myself with blood soaking through any bandage, and said not go blame him. \n\nMy mother isn't much better in a sense. The only real time she's given any physical touch was when she would hold me down in a bear hug whenever I was misbehaving. Not even realizing my acting out started after my dad's death. Not once has she really even hugged me or anything since. Doesn't really give any privacy, including my room and restroom, is constantly having me take her places and freaks out whenever I try to do something for myself. Had me almost conditioned to believe that I'd take her with me when I move and is now saying I have to take them all...which would be difficult to take multiple pets to any house to rent. She basically raised me to be extremely dependent on her, and anytime I break free of that it's a nightmare. \n\n\nThere was also something that involved both of them. When I was 11, I had a \"friend\" about 2 years older and that I've known since I was 5...try to do things and basically made me keep quite. Though I didn't know exactly what was going on. He would try to pin me to a shed that is connected to my house, try to touch me and try to have me touch him. My step father would chase him away 2 or 3 times in all this when he saw something.  Twice convincing me to let him in the house when I was alone. I remember that both times he wanted to go to my room and kept trying to ask me to take my clothing off. I don't remember doing so either time. But I guess I told my niece at some point and she told. But she claimed it was the older brother of this boy. When I was asked about it I ended up in a corner, and crying being told I was lying. Not once during this did my \"step father\" say anything of what he knew and didn't help.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

She told me I was stupid because I didn\u2019t sign on the back properly where it was needed to be since the line to sign was very light. \nA few minutes later I was putting the checks away, and mom choked me because I yelled in response to her accusation that I was hiding in my room. I told her I was putting away my checking stuff.\n\nShe said I was an idiot and that I have rocks for brains and that she won\u2019t help me pay for college \n\nShe said I was a lazy bitch for not having a job or drivers license. \n\n3:13\n\nHer Attitude is normal and tried to be calming. \n\n4:00\n\nI told her my neck and throat still hurt, she said, \u201cGo ahead! Press charges! You can move out!\u201d \n\n5:14\n\nStill making remarks about how I need to listen better, and how I do a terrible job with everything I do. \n\n5/19/18\n1:00\nI was doing yard work and took a thirty minute break. Then I decided to get back to work. I closed the door harder to make sure it was closed on my way back out. Dad said, \u201cGet your ass back in here now!\u201d I walked back into the house. \u201cIf you think the yanking mom gave you was bad, do that again or give me bullcrap and I\u2019ll whip you with my belt.\u201d\n\n7:25\nWhen I told her my neck still hurt, she said, \u201cYour neck must be out. I didn\u2019t grab you that hard. It was supposed to scare you and get your attention. I didn\u2019t leave a mark and if I wanted to, I would have.\u201d\n\n5/28/18\n\nMom woke me up by yelling. She found out I told my aunt and told me, \u201cSo you think you can be a tattletale and tell your aunt on me? If you think I assaulted you, you can move the hell out.\u201d\n\n6/1/18\nMy mom and aunt were visiting and I was trying to make conversation. I was dismissed and I left the room and returned with a few moments later. I don\u2019t remember how the topic came up, but mom asked if I wanted more abuse saying that she could give me more. I said \u201cno, the choking was enough\u201d, and they both laughed. I wish I could\u2019ve said \u201cyes, so I could have more evidence\u201d but it wouldn\u2019t have helped the situation. \n\nJuly 2018\nI\u2019ve been repeatedly called a freeloader, mentally disabled, a demon, and a imbecile since I last updated this. I don\u2019t know how much longer I can take before university. I cannot distinguish verbal/emotional abuse from what I consider \u201cnormal\u201d behavior anymore. The yelling and insults are constant, almost every night, and it tears me apart inside, where I just need to get away as soon as I can. \n\nJuly 21, 2018 4:15\n\nI was doing laundry and I walked around the corner to my parents bedroom door. My lazy eye was looking upward as I was rubbing the area underneath it. My mom stood in the doorway with my black blanket and accused me of rolling my eyes. She told me I rolled my eyes. I said no, I was rubbing it. She raised her hands at me as if she was going to slap me, so I raised both of my hands in front of me to block her. She then, moved her hands down, and so did I. \u201cGo fucking lie to someone else!\u201d She then shoved me back a few feet as I tried to catch my breath. She proceeded to scream at the top of her lungs at me while I just stood and listened. She called me an imbecile, and that going to university scares her because she thinks I\u2019m an idiot and I\u2019m not mentally prepared. She later apologized after I said my chest hurt and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but now you know I won\u2019t put up with your shit anymore. I\u2019ve had enough. I\u2019m at my wits end.\u201d The rest of the night has been continuous comments on how my reality isn\u2019t true and I know nothing about life and how I won\u2019t succeed. Apparently if I don\u2019t clean the house all the time to her satisfaction, I\u2019m a freeloader.\n\n10:30pm\nShe threatens to give me a black eye saying, \u201cIf you even say \u201cyeah ok\u201d one more time I will strangle you with your clothes or better yet, give you a black eye. I\u2019m done with your shit and you need to control yourself.\u201d\n\nJuly 22 8:50 am\nI told mom that I didn\u2019t want to go to church because I need to practice maths. She said, \u201cSince you\u2019re going to college you\u2019re giving up on God? You should be ashamed! You\u2019re coming to church. It\u2019s your problem that you\u2019ve procrastinated and you\u2019ve had the whole summer to practice, but haven\u2019t done anything to get a good score. You\u2019re going to church!\u201d\n\n8/5/19\nAngry that I never clean and thinks I just want to me to be a mentally retarded disabled person. She says she is not proud of me and that she\u2019s ashamed I\u2019m \u201cgoing to take a math class for retards.\u201d She won\u2019t help me go to university, and claims I am not worth spending money on. She says she\u2019s embarrassed and that I\u2019m mentally retarded. \u201cIt blows my mind how scary stupid you are being\u201d While I was in the shower she hit the curtain and barely missed me. I hate my life here. \nShe saw what I was wearing to church, she said, \u201cYou should change. It\u2019s not a nice shirt, but fine! You\u2019re a retarded adult, you\u2019re your own retarded adult and you can choose how retarded you look. I cannot help you. You are beyond help.\u201d \n\n\nI was writing a list down of chores, and my mom said, \u201cYou know, college is a privilege that can be taken away, I don\u2019t have to give you shit, and if you don\u2019t finish these chores I won\u2019t let you go and not give you the $5000 you need.\u201d I was writing the list of chores down on the couch, and she started putting stuff into the car as I was writing. She said, \u201cOh just sit on your ass and don\u2019t help with anything!\u201d\n\n8/16/18\nI didn\u2019t do the chores to her satisfaction. She shoved me, and when I told her to not shove me, she said she could do whatever she wants to me because I live in her house.\n\n9/11/18\nI didn\u2019t finish the chores to her satisfaction because of my visual impairment. She was complaining about me. Tonight she said, \u201c(talking about a terrible job I did) It won\u2019t be good when you run out of money.\u201d It was a reference to how she controls my finances since I don\u2019t have a job nor am SSN Card, and how I\u2019m at her mercy to get the things I need. \n\n9/12/18\nI was sleeping on the couch when I heard my mom say in the other room, \u201cAshley.. you fucking dumbass. I\u2019m so ready to kick you out. I don\u2019t have to give you shit but it\u2019s not like I get anything in return already. You better get a damn job. You always do a shitty job at everything you do.\u201d\n\n9:30\nShe says, \u201cI just don\u2019t know where else to look for this box.\u201d I said, \u201csame\u201d She said, \u201cOh same same, you are here 24/7 you should have looked in every damn box we\u2019ve fucking owned.\u201d \n\n9:40\n\u201cYou fucking owe me $200! You lost the box with a few hundred dollars of Victoria Secret! Why do you fail to act your age and keep up with your shit?! You act LD with planning for yourself and you cannot even get yourself to college!!\u201d\n I never paid it back.\n9/19-20/18\nShe keeps saying that she\u2019s so angry with me that she could strangle me with her bare hands and how she thinks university is a mistake for me and I don\u2019t deserve to go.\n\n12/20/18\nMy dad said this after dinner. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to talk about life choices.. I think she understands where I stand on that silliness.\u201d (Referencing me being part of the LGBT+ community)\n\nMy mother also said that I made myself fail my math class, \u201cYou caused this yourself.\u201d\n\nI asked my mom to respect my privacy and she said that she \u201chas the right\u201d to see whatever I bring into the house and be looked at.\n\n\n12/30/18\nAs long as I live under their house I have to go to church. If I don\u2019t want to, I have to get the fuck out. I have no choice. I don\u2019t like going Sunday, I will go both Sunday morning and night, and if I don\u2019t like that, they will take me Wednesday, and if not that, Sunday and Wednesday and Thursday night. My dad said that if I don\u2019t want to go, that I can get the fuck out, get a fucking job, and leave. All this while I\u2019m trying to tell them that I\u2019m an adult. This hurts a lot because I have no say in anything. My dad said that I had the choice to do whatever I want at university, but since I failed one of my classes I had to go home and go to community college. So basically since I have made bad life choices I have to go to church.. I want to kill myself so they understand how much I hate it.\n\n1/7/19\n\u201cYou better get out of bed before I kick your ass out (all because I forgot the laundry load). You need to quit freeloading!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s your way of being pissy and disrespectful. It\u2019s like pissing in our face! Like piss off! If you can\u2019t help around here, you will never make it back to college.\u201d\n\nLater, I showed a math problem to my dad and he said, \u201cWhat? You went backwards with math and you can\u2019t do it? You that stupid you can\u2019t do basic stuff?\u201d\n\n\n1/12/19\n\u201cYou never act like an adult! You can\u2019t sit on your ass all the time! I asked you to scrub out the tub and there\u2019s still a layer of shit. You\u2019re simple little piss off attitude is getting old. You didn\u2019t move back here just to sit on your fucking ass and give me a shitty attitude. You just want to be left alone. What are you doing all night? Showing tour German friend your boobs all night in Europe?\u201d\n(I have a friend in the U.K)\n\n1/28/19\nI joking said to my sister that I would get her with a spoon if she didn\u2019t quit running around in circles in the kitchen. My mom said threatening to hit her is abuse. I told her that hitting someone is abuse or threatening to, is abuse wether you\u2019re the parent or not the parent. She said that I need to shut up and let her discipline how she wants to.\n\n1/29/19\n\u201cYou\u2019re two seconds from being kicked Out of this house! You need to quit this depressive repressive bullshit!\u201d\n\nShe took my phone after I started taking notes on what she was saying to me. She went through some of my stuff, and this was all taking place as she was driving. After taking my phone away, she said she had the right to, because she bought my phone and I live in her house. In reality, I pay my bill, and I\u2019m not on their phone plan. \n\nShe looked at my lock screen and went , \u201cMph, Pride\u201d.. it was silent for a while, and she said, \u201cYou know despite everything it is hard to watch you struggle.. spiritually, religiously, emotionally.. you need to talk to God. Man cannot help you. Sure, you can talk to someone.. you should go talk to someone, but when are you just going to surrender to god?\u201d\n\nWe finished the ride and she said that she loves me and that she\u2019s proud of me, and that I\u2019m a loving person, even though she called me cold hearted a while ago.\n\n\n\n3/13/19\n\u201cHappy birthday! You better take your math test, come home and pack your fucking bags! You can live with someone else!\u201d\n\nShe then proceeded to yell at me for 20 minutes about how I need to surrender to God, \u201cWhen will you surrender to God? You may think you can.. but what about when you\u2019re on your deathbed and you can accomplish all of these things, yet go to hell. There are plenty of things that will send you to hell like you\u2019re bad attitude and other things (referencing me being bisexual). She says I need to calm down and relax and not stress, but I told her that she adds stress, and she said that she yells at me and does it to \u201ccall me out\u201d because she loves me. I feel broken, I have a test today and I have no idea how it will go now. I was confident, but now my head is filled with negativity and failure.\n\n4/12/19\n\u201cHomosexuality is a choice. Are you going to resume it at university?You\u2019ve made a complete 180 since you left. You weren\u2019t this way when you left. You dated a guy and you left for uni for 90 days and you came back saying you like women. This is totally against the Bible, and you know it. This is against everything we\u2019ve taught you. You can\u2019t be fulfilled sexually, emotionally or spiritually when with the same sex. You told your cousin that because she\u2019s gay that she\u2019ll die and rot in hell! (This is two weeks after she committed suicide via overdose). You could advocate for so many things but you never advocated for yourself! I don\u2019t want to argue about this anymore. You\u2019ve pushed god and everyone else away. There will be consequences in life: emotional , financial and spiritually.\u201d I asked her why people get offended by gay marriage and she asked why I get offended when they ask about homosexuality. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect us to change our life-long beliefs.\u201d\n\n5/6/18\n\u201cWe will not fund your alternative lifestyle. That\u2019s a bunch of hogwash. You were not \u201cborn that way\u201d there\u2019s never been evidence of a gay gene. We will never pay for a class about homo history or anything like that. We will not find a lifestyle you think you want to live, you\u2019ve been deceived. We don\u2019t care if the university has a homo history required or not (it doesn\u2019t but had a gender and multicultural GUR requirement). Every time you leave the church sanctuary during service it\u2019s like you are a demon that has to flee.\u201d -Parents\n\n5/19/19\n\u201cYou can\u2019t intellectualize or rationalize the story because you never submit or surrender to god. So stop trying and shut up.\u201d-mom\n\nThis is what my mother told me when I said the story of Joshua going to battle in the Bible and stopping the sun was illogical because of the fact that they believed that the sun goes around the earth at the time..  but in reality, the earth would have stopped.\n\nThe pastor said earlier, \u201cThe Bible is the same today, tomorrow and will be forever! It will never change its meaning or purpose!!\u201d I said it changes every fifty years and my mother said to shut up.\n\n5/20/19\n\u201cYou posted that stuff online. Is that your way of coming out to the family? Disrespecting your family! Just throw out everything you were taught out the door! You don\u2019t respect dad and I one bit. Not everyone shares your high flying flag ideas. Don\u2019t waste time on sites trying to form your own political opinion. You claim to be this way before you have a girlfriend. Grow up! Open your spiritual eyes! You are blinded to this hateful person you have become because we don\u2019t accept who you are. You let it affect every part of your being! You give up your soul. That\u2019s what scares me the most.\u201d\n\nThis is the response I got after I posted something to Facebook about LGBT Equality.\n\n\nJuly-August \nI was told that I have a demon in me for being bisexual, and for not wanting to go to church. She also said my anxiety was a spiritual war going on, and I will be forced to go until I leave the house. \n\nOn July 3-5, I was told by my family that they will not support me being LGBT+, and that they will never change their views. I have video evidence for this.\n\nOn July 16, I was told:\n\u201cAre you so dirty on the inside you don\u2019t care about your outside appearance. Are you not going to change?\u201d\n\nOn August 11, mom told me this:\n\n\u201cQuit glaring at me. Go get your suitcase. Go get your suitcase now Demon! Quit glaring at me demon. You don\u2019t even realize it. You\u2019re just giving me the shittiest look, snarling your nose. When I get back from church you better be gone. You\u2019re a guest here, you\u2019re not in a hotel where you don\u2019t do shit. You\u2019re a guest in my home. Get out. Take your last shower. You don\u2019t even know the evil and hate in your own heart.\u201d\n\nSeptember 28, 2019\nMy mom, sister, aunt, and cousins along with my dad and I were going to a farm today. We were going to participate in the fall festivities. I don\u2019t remember every detail, but I don\u2019t remember everything. My family, specifically my mom and dad were very upset with my grandpa as he\u2019s a bit of a narcissist. Anyway, they were both already frustrated. My sister said she didn\u2019t want to go and continually cried about it, and was even put into the car while she was crying. While driving. My dad got upset, and said he didn\u2019t want to go anymore and that my mom and I should go with my aunt and her kids instead. We got to my aunts, and we parked in the drive way. My sister got out of the car and ran up the driveway towards me because my dad told me and my mom to go out prior. My mom asked her to get back into the car, but my dad got out of the car, angry as hell. My sister was a sobbing mess, and he picked her up by her hair, wrapped his arm around her stomach, then put her in the car seat. My aunt was shocked at what she witnessed. When I asked my sister earlier, she said he grabbed her by her coat or neck and that she felt choked for a bit. My sister and I went to my aunts truck with her other kids and Ava started to calm down. My aunt asked if my dad is normally like that and I explained that he spanks us with a belt (although I haven\u2019t been in a couple of years) and if I say something or look at him a certain way, he threatens to slap me or kick me out: \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, you can live out on the streets\u201d he says.\n\nI don\u2019t have a job and I can\u2019t drive. My family has control over my education and what I can study as they have religious views that don\u2019t accept LGBT or Big Bang/ evolution-based topics. I told them I was interested in an LGBT history class after I signed up for it. I ended up transferring back to my old community college, so I didn\u2019t end up taking the classes at the university I attended (family made me come back from university to community college due to low grades), but my family said that if I took a class like that (specifically LGBT), I would have to pay for college myself. \n\nSo here I am. I don\u2019t know what to do. I want to see a therapist (and a psychiatrist to see if I have anxiety), but my mother thinks I should wait before I get medication because \u201cIt only helps so much\u201d but I\u2019ve had symptoms for over a year. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or how to handle this.\n\nLater, Milo snarled at my dad because he tried to grab his collar. My dad picked him up by his collar, and slung him across the room. He seems like he\u2019ll be okay, but I am not.\n\nSeptember 29th, 2019\nI\u2019m in the church\u2019s quiet room trying to relax and study because this weekend has been hectic. \n\nMom:\u201cGet in the sanctuary.\u201d\nMe: \u201cNo, I\u2019m studying.\u201d\nMom: \u201cYou\u2019re going into the sanctuary.\u201d\nMe: \u201cWhy?\u201d\nMom: \u201cYou know why.\u201d\nMe: *gets stuff in purse*\nMom: \u201cFine, Lose your soul.\u201d\n\nMy dad told me that I will not be able to sit alone in church and that all of my studying must be done before church. When will I be free from the very place that hurts me?\nWhen I contacted my aunt she said that the authorities don\u2019t need to get involved with my sisters situation. One less person to trust. \u201d\n\nThat\u2019s everything up to today. Please help. \n\nI don\u2019t have anywhere to go.

{"post_id": "db51bm", "created_utc": 1569810162, "title": "Was this real?", "author": "Sockednonny", "self_text": "I could write a book about all that happened between the person I had to cut off earlier this year and myself. But I'd like to work out a few things and whether they had any basis in truth or reality, one at a time and separately. So I ask you, what do you think? Do you have any information or resource that might help me discern the truth?\n\nThe first thing I'd like to figure out is this situation:\n\n**Background info:** Been friends with this person for many years. Became *best* friends over the years. EARLY in the friendship, friend said she had Dissociative Identity Disorder. Friend shifted to alters twice in my presence, once or twice over Skype video. Would text me on rare occasions from a very young alter, who would alert me to suicide attempts. I did everything in my power to support her, often staying up or sending funds or taking a long distance flight to her on short notice (once I'd moved away). All of this looked and sounded very real, how could my friend possibly lie to me? Except, toward the end of our friendship, friend confessed she had been lying (to me and several others) because she was sure she could never have love, only pity. She also told me she was not a victim of satanic ritual abuse, as she had told me previously, which I though accounted for the DID. I thought on it for a while and decided she was very brave confessing the lie and forgave her and we moved on. So I thought.\n\n**Situation:** I flew out to her for about a week. Purpose was to help her move away from a narcissistic husband. I came to help drive her around to tie up loose ends and stay with her and support her so she didn't decide that moving or starting over was actually impossible and give up on the whole thing, which is how I best understood I could support her at the time. There were three instances where she displayed behavior very similar to times she was speaking through alters. \n\n1. One night she was having a really bad pain night (chronic pain), and walked out, seemingly half awake.  she was fingering the knives. I knew she wanted to cut, she\u2019d talked about cutting before to \u201ctrip the pain gate\u201d in her brain, meaning, to shut down the ongoing chronic pain by a quick burst of greater pain. Previous conversations with her had me wary about using physical force to restrain her. I think I could, but I had the idea it would subconsciously damage a lot of trust. So I had to try and talk her out of it. I\u2019m not good at using my verbal words to talk someone down. But I tried, desperately. I got her back to her room, somehow. Hid the kitchen knives. But she wandered back out and found kitchen shears. I begged her over and over not to do it, but she kept reaching. At this point, I didn\u2019t know what else to do but let her try to trip the pain gate, because who am I and what do I know about chronic pain? I asked if she understood me, and she indicated non-verbally that she did. I said I was going to let her do it, but that I would stay there and keep her away from arteries. She dug the points of the scissors into her arm (or thigh? memory fuzzes), but never broke skin. She let me direct her away from arteries. Eventually she let me put her to bed.\n2. We had closed up her apartment for the last time and were going to her friend's place, which could be reached only by ferry. She was asleep as I parked in the ferry lot, waiting to get on. She started, as if waking up, and asked where she was and what she was doing. I answered calmly, saying we were going to (friend's house). She seemed to panic, saying, no, no, it was all a mistake and she had to go home (meaning, back to the apartment), and reached for the door handle. I panicked. I was in a rental car that I could not abandon, and I could not abandon a car in the ferry lot, blocking other drivers when it was their turn, and if she ran off into the night like that how was I supposed to bring her back? And if she ran off into the night and I didn't stop her, was I a murderer and a terrible friend? I thought I would have her blood on my hands if I didn't stop her. I tried to talk her into staying, but I have my own issues and I'm not very verbally persuasive. It went back and forth for a while, eventually I just begged and pleaded. I don't remember how she ended up staying and falling back asleep, but as she slept, she stopped breathing, and would only breathe right if I repositioned her head so that it wasn't tilted at an angle. I had to keep this going as well, as we finally drove onto the ferry.\n3. Another time she started talking about it being a mistake again, but we were already at (friend's place). But she was talking like she was \"going to leave\" and \"everything would be okay once she left\u2026\" as she reached for the handle of the back door. We were in the middle of a wooded island area, with nobody around. She sounded like she was going to walk out into the night. Every time the only reason she didn\u2019t (so I thought) was I eventually broke down crying and begging her not to go. Showing my weakness, showing my terror, which I thought brought out the part of her that wanted to protect and take care of me. I wasn\u2019t TRYING to manipulate her and I was genuinely terrified, but I started wondering if that was what I was doing.\n\nThese instances all happened at night-time, and she had a lot of issues sleeping and was heavily sleep deprived, so I chalked all this up to a sort of dissociative dream walking state. However, this is one of a very long string of things that, when laid side by side, being to piece together a picture of manipulation and emotional abuse, and I had to end our friendship. That being said, I have trouble because I keep obsessing about some of the points, like this one. How DOES a sleepwalking state work? Has anyone else had this done to them? Is there a way to tell if this particular thing is real, or am I right to class it in the same category as her acting out having DID to me for years?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

and i was heavily identifying, i felt seen, i felt understood - then he mentioned \"she hit me\".\n\ni've hit my ex before. twice, i remember clearly, but there may be other times. it's been pushing/physically grabbing his arm so he doesn't walk out of the convo. this last time though, i punched him once in the chest while we were fighting. looks really bad written in black and white, doesn't it? it does for me too. i feel like a monster. i feel like i couldn't break the cycle of abuse that i had inherited, though i seem to have broken it with every other relationship, including with my parents. so why can't i get through this relationship feeling clean?\n\nthe first time i hit him was 2 years into our relationship (been together for \\~6), when i found out that he was emotionally cheating on me with his ex, after 9 months of ugly fights where i was begging him to cut her out, and he was telling me i was uncontrollably jealous and needed therapy. then he told her he was in love with her. they had agreed with each other to not tell me. i don't think he would have ever told me, since he still made plans to see her after, but i believe he wanted to see how things went with me - hedging his bets. during this time, he told me that i was \"only a good girlfriend on paper\". i stopped cutting in 2011, i started again the day after i found out he cheated.\n\nthe second time i remember was a month ago, when i begged him to leave. in 2018-2019 we've been through after a tumultuous break-up (where he took 5 months to move out and would still sleep in my bed before he moved out and we'd cry together and i let him because i felt guilty and i loved, and still love, him, and i have no regrets about showing up like this) and an even more tumultuous lets-try-again, that resulted in me finding an apartment, applying, fronting $5000 for first month's rent and security deposits so that we could move in (he is in a bad financial situation, which he has alluded to being because of me kicking him out the first time), paying $500 for his cat to live in the unit whereas my cat can't stay with us anymore because we failed to socialize his cat properly, resulting in his cat using my cat's litter box and eating her food, even while he was home because he refused to monitor it closely - a fight i distinctly remember. my cat eventually got very sick from the stress, and i've sent her to my parents' house where she's been super happy ever since. i found the apartment by myself and i acquired it by myself, and i invited him to live with me because it was a 2bd/2ba and i wanted this to work and thought it could, since the logistics would solve the problems we had while living in a 1bd/1ba.\n\nwhen it became clear that it wouldn't work, i tried having a conversation where i told him if this relationship can't work, we can't live together. his response was to say i was throwing him out like trash, and he wasn't interested in leaving because it's inconvenient and triggering from last time. i begged, i pleaded, i negotiated, i told him i'd pay for moving, i offered to help him find a place. and he still said that he wouldn't move, and i should move my living room furniture (which he has been using, including my ps4) into my bedroom to \"leave the space neutral\". he said i'd have to go the legal route to get him out because he's here to stay until the lease ends. i really, really lost it, and it resulted in me hitting him, and him threatening to hit me - but he never did. i felt used for my resources, i felt trapped, i felt crazy, i felt abused, i felt abusive. after a week of silence he reached out and said he'd found a place but he'd only move if i needed him to - and i couldn't do it, after all the guilt. i couldn't throw him out like trash after i'd mistreated him. i needed to make it right.\n\ni've struggled with self-harm since the infidelity, and had two suicide attempts in 2015-2017. during those times, when i reached out to beg for support, he responded by blocking me. and i know the line between self-harm, and emotional manipulation. i was truly in pain and needed it to end. i couldn't escape the oppressive feeling that i would never be good enough for him to not hurt me. but then a day after he blocked me he'd change his mind, and show up at my apartment while i was still recovering from the overdose, and i'll never forget how deeply i loved him after he showed up for me like that. i've always felt guilty about the suicide attempts. i didn't care if i woke up, i actively didn't want to, but i didn't die, so i must have done it for attention, right?\n\nthe last time i ever self-harmed, he called the police on me (after many incidents, such as hearing his neighbor's dog being beaten, where he didn't call the police, or i wasn't allowed to, because he's a black man in america - and we have had this conversation a million times, and that HIS safety needs to come first, and authorities threaten that, and i'm a bad ally if i don't respect that, but i'm a chinese woman, so the cops would never hurt me unfairly). the day he called the police, which is seared into my memory as one of the worst things that has ever happened to me, something in me either broke or was built, and i knew i wanted to live, and to live better than this. i knew i had to fight for my life. i knew i had to get out or change, or i'd die a monster. i knew this wasn't normal. i wasn't doing anything to put him in danger, i wasn't doing anything that warranted a call to the police vs a call to the suicide hotline. i wasn't doing this on the reg. i wasn't even doing this on an annual basis. i was doing this when i broke, because the rest of it wasn't right. the night i hit him a month ago, i know, was mutually abusive - i can't spell out all the words he said to me and all the actions he took to create a reality in which i was alienated, misunderstood, speechless, powerless, but i knew it wasn't right.\n\nwhy haven't i left? because i'm afraid that he will tell everyone he's been abused and i'll live with that demon/stigma forever - the abusive ex, the crazy one. not the one who came back like a beaten dog after the first infidelity, only to find he's been pursuing another woman (and of course gaslighting me about it) all along. not the one who keeps showing up with my wallet and heart and legs open. because i love him. because he makes me laugh, and understands me, even if he turns around and uses it against me. because even if he can't be supportive towards me, it's because of his trauma, and how can i abandon someone with whom i so keenly identify?\n\nbut y'all, i'm tired of this. i'm tired of taking responsibility without acknowledgement of context. i'm tired of sacrificing only to be told it was manipulation. i'm tired of not coming first, of not feeling good enough, of not feeling GOOD enough to deserve something better than this. i'm tired of friendship being used as another lasso to keep me in a toxic dynamic. i'm tired of love that only shows up when the ego is satisfied. i'm tired of feeling like the abuser, i'm tired of feeling abused, i'm tired of feeling all this.\n\ni'm in therapy and have been for three years - i first found my therapist after a bad convo that resulted in him leaving abruptly once again, and i reached out saying i needed help out of a relationship. now, despite the fact that we're still sharing a home, i'm happy with myself. i'm good to my friends and even better to my family, i take care of shit, i show up for people. i'm not perfect and i'd never claim to be inherently good. i grew up having my ass beaten over the slightest thing and i never wanted to inflict it on others. but i believe that people exert a gravity, and it distorts you, it pulls you in, like a black hole - but the black hole doesn't swallow the universe, only the things that get close. that's mutual abuse, **and i want to know from yall, is distance the only cure? am i a monster? are all the things i've said here merely rationalizations?** i let this happen, i invited it to keep happening. i'm trying to have faith, because i don't want to be an empty faithless thing to someone who says he loves me. maybe he'd love be better if i had faith. for all the bad he's done, all the bad I'VE done, there's good. but i spent all this time talking about the bad, and that means something. **can faith in another heal, the way it does when you find god? are we all just imperfect blobs looking to be shaped by a gentle hand?**\n\ni sent the video to him yesterday, after we had a conversation about how he doesn't think we're working towards anything, but still wants to live with me and see how things go, and also he's downloaded hinge and has been talking to other women but really has no interest and still \"likes me better than other people\". i hope he sees how fucked the whole thing is, and can release himself. if he doesn't by the end of 2019, i'm going to move out, even if i was the one who found this place and have grown so attached to it. i don't feel like i can kick him out. legally, unless he assaults me, i can't kick him out.\n\nthank you, and love you, stranger, for reading this. as i read over my own writing i hear his voice telling me whatever feedback i get is just going to be distorted, because i'm only telling my side of the story, and i can't even tell that right because my memory can't be trusted. so assume he's better than the shit he's done to me, because he is, he really, really is. **adjust for all the good i can't tell you here, and be real with me.**\n\n**tldr:** this is my experience with mutual abuse - it's never okay. but then it happens. what do we do? why does it happen? have you been through this? am i abusive (yes) and how do i talk to myself and others about it? is there a way out? how can two people living together share such divergent realities? how do i leave? should i stay and fix it? is it my fault?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

{"post_id": "dbkcpv", "created_utc": 1569886419, "title": "Hope and growth", "author": "EddiePlutonium", "self_text": "Hello all, \n\nThis is a post about how things can get better. Because they can and they do, and sometimes reading even one story about hope and growth can make a difference. Fair warning: it may be long winded. \n\nReading through all of your experiences has helped normalize what I've been through, and that soothes me...because abuse is so taboo, it's a weird open secret that some know about, but no one dares to talk about too much about it. \n\nSo first of all, thank you for sharing with me. \n\nAs many if not all of you, I too have had a history of abuse and trauma. In my case, its my father. Let's call him \"Mike\".\n\nMike is the single most fucked up person you can think of. He's a walking tragedy of a human being. Mike has so many presenting diagnostics that a psychiatrist couldn't even decide on where to begin assigning labels on the types of mental illnesses he had. There were too many, and they all intermeshed in a mess of maladaptive coping mechanisms and misshapen thoughts and ideas... Abused and tormented in all shapes and forms from his early childhood, Mike adapted to his own hurt in unhealthy ways...because Mike didn't know better, and Mike was probably doing his best to also cope with the abuse at the time (or so i like to believe). This is the good old story of the \"Abuse Cycle\". Mike got abused by his parents (my grandparents) and Mike in turn abused his children (my sister and I). Circle of life. \n\nMike is all kinds of messed up...its terrifying, mesmerizing and pathetic all at once. He is a force to be reconned with. And I did, my entire life. Maybe you know a Mike. Predatory, violent, mean, menacing, manipulative, smart and charming. Able to trick you and play games with your mind. He's skilled all right, skilled at bending your will and making you responsible for all of his own faults and mistakes. That's Mike's #1 move: *the gaslight*  \"This is your fault, you made me do this. You deserve this. If you hadn't provoked me, I wouldn't have done this to you\"...stuff like that. \n\nMike is an ecclectic abuser, so he dabbles in physical abuse, verbal abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse and monetary abuse. He's a Jack of all trades, he just picked up what his parents taught him over the years... \n\nWell, I won't sugar coat it, there was a lot of pain, and hurt, confusion and despair in my household. I am the child of a sociopath, I was abused, and I am a survivor. I am affected by this upbringing everyday, and I've got physical and emotional scars to prove it.\n\nIt's not easy but I work on myself all the time. I work hard to heal myself. I love the broken and hurt bits of me. I look at them, and name them. No longer do I shut out my inner child, the one that's hurting and crying from Mike's abuse. No, no more. I look at the abused parts of me, and I hold them close. I give them love and care, because that's what they're missing. And I give them this because they are me. They aren't ALL of me, but they are A PART of me. It was so hard at first, but its possible to learn to love all of yourself. It's a continuous journey. \n\nI worked on seeing and recognizing my triggers. Now when I get triggered, I know what's going on. I don't blame others for the hurt that wakes up inside my core. I don't run away, I don't hide, I don't lash out...I learned to recognize the trigger, how it feels, and how to soothe it myself. I can manage this on my own. I know me best.\n\nI learned how to engage in healthy relationships with others. I don't need them to comfort me or tell me I'm good. I do that myself. I learned to be lenient and forgiving towards mistakes, everyone makes them, were all human. I also learned to know my boundaries and needs, and how to express them and have them respected in a relationship. I work on this everyday still. It never stops. But its worth it, so so worth it. \n\nAll in all, i don't feel like a victim most of the time. I feel strong. I feel like i have lived a big life, and that I saw an opportunity to grow and learn from the hurt that happened to me during these many years.\n\nFun fact, I still live with my parents. And that includes Mike. He's simmered down...he's getting older you know. He's slow, and tired. We mostly stay clear from one another but i make him a cup of coffee everyday anyways. Sometimes we chat a bit. Sometimes its alright, and maybe that's the best it'll ever be. I'll take it. It beats the other stuff we've been through. It still hurts to think *this* is the \"dad\" experience I get, but I'm working on acceptance, and letting go. \n\nI'm safe. I'm strong. I'm flawed. I'm growing...and most important of all, I love all of me. \n\nThanks for reading, and God speed in your journey for growth and greatness. Because you all inspire me, and you all are the strongest people I know.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I'm scared that i must be making it up because nothing happened to him, and other than having ARFID hes like the perfect child (my parents favour him sm, like, his first car was a 2018 BMW)\n\nidk", "subreddit": "abuse"}
