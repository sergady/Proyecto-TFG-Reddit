Before then, I always had very intense periods with debilitating cramps, vomitting, occasional fainting, and heavy flow but they would always only last about 3 days. I stopped getting any period at all within the first month of taking the pill. At my first check-up with my OBGYN after starting the pill I told her I didn't have any periods at all and she said that I was fine to continue taking it as long as I didn't mind not having a period. I figured that I had hit the jackpot so I kept taking it.\n\nA year later--over the course of 2.5-3 months--I gained 50 lbs, lost all my libido, started growing lots of dark thick hairs on my neck and stomach and was experiencing horrible pain during sex despite nothing else in my life (work, school, stress, family, diet, exercise etc) having changed and I wasn't on any other medication besides the BC. I went back to my OBGYN who ordered some blood tests thinking it was a thyroid issue. From there I saw a GP, a 2nd OBGYN, an NP, and an endocrinologist; none of whom have been able to give me any kind of legitimate diagnosis. The GP said to my face \"Sometimes women get fat and they just have to deal with that\". I've basically run myself broke getting test after test with no answers. I'm hoping that if I post all the tests and results I've gotten so far someone here might be able to suggest other possible diagnoses to look at being tested for or any kind of specialist I might not know about that could possibly help. I should also mention that at no point has there been a possible pregnancy (same-sex monogamous)\n\n**TESTS:**\n\nDate: April 18th\n\n* Test type: ASSAY, FREE THYROXINE-BLOOD\n   * Result Values:\n      * FREE T4 - 1.0\n* Test type: CBC with DIFF-BLOOD\n   * Result Values:\n      * WBC (thou/mcL) - 6.0\n      * RBC (mil/mcl) - 4.72\n      * HEMOGLOBIN (g/dL) - 13.4\n      * HEMATOCRIT (%) - 41\n      * MCV (fl) - 88\n      * MCH (pg) - 29\n      * MCHC (g/dL) - 33\n      * PLATELET (thou/mcL) - 238\n      * ABS.

I'm hoping to get some helpful advice until my MRI here. Been dealing with multiple symptoms since October 12th, coincidentally the same time I started taking Ivermectin 3mg four times daily. Started noticing muscle twitching Day 2 nighttime. I took it up to Day 3 midday for a total of 10 pills 30mg until I realized I couldn't bear the muscle twitching. I ceased the medication and made sure with my doctor to not continue its usage. Other side effects were rash on chest like a sunburn, peeling skin on fingers, felt like heart palpitations I was experiencing as well but could have just been muscles in my chest spasming.\nConstantly twitched somewhere in my body every second for weeks. By day 8 I finally went to an urgent care. EKG and blood work was normal. Day 9 I had an appointment with a cardiologist and neurologist. I was experiencing tremors at this time in my hands, as well as the muscle twitching. ECHO heart test came out normal, cardiologist sent me home saying to intake more sodium in my diet. At this point it's safe to assume it's not a heart issue but maybe a brain issue. I talked to my neurologist about the Ivermectin and how it may be causing my muscle spasms. He said that would be very unusual because Ivermectin cannot pass the blood brain barrier. I thought to myself \"but would if it did in my case?\" I was prescribed Methylprednisolone for the shaking but while doing research on it (as I do for all drugs) I decided not to take it as it can severely weaken your immune system. He also referred me for an MRI which is upcoming.\nDay 10/11 is when I started experiencing a pressure on the left side of my head. It feels like a giant bug is clinged onto my scalp. It is not painful, just very uncomfortable. I also experience arbitrary itching over my body that last a few minutes and goes away. Sometimes pimple-like bumps will form and disappear along with the itching. \nDay 12 new symptom of abrupt noise startling my entire body. Hard to explain but if you research hyperacusis (which is something I've had for years) it is like that except not confined to only my ear. Began experiencing shortness of breath this night, numbness in legs. Very rapid eye twitching when eyes were closed (could not sleep because of this). A feeling like I was going to pass out and never wake up. The shaking this night was the worst it has ever been. All of this was accompanied by extreme nausea. I went to the ER this night. ER checked my blood sugar which was around 144. Blood pressure was normal. Urine was normal. I had another EKG done which came out to be normal. Once I saw the doctor I told him that I believe all of this is caused from the Ivermectin and its effect on my brain and he dismissed it as unlikely. He had me do a chest x-ray which was normal. I was pretty aggravated as I didn't believe I had any issues with my heart, but my brain. Went home with a stomach full of anti-nausea medicine and that's it.\nNext few days were same old symptoms. Day 15 I experienced something similar to the night I needed to go to the hospital,  but not as severe. Day 20, which was last night, got the feeling again. Realized that it worsens when I sit or lay down, so I kept myself pacing around the house last night. Was able to fall asleep but I woke up many times to distorted vision, almost like vertigo.\nAnyway, you get the idea. Now I'm up to today. So far I feel pretty food compared to other days, just an uncomfortable numbness in my head. I feel like the muscle twitching has died down over the days but still occurs. The Ivermectin has been out of my system since the twitching started, I never took it again after that. But the effects have seemed to not go away. I'm wondering, if it's been out of my system for so long, how could it still be causing new symptoms to occur? Or could it have just been a coincidence that these symptoms started concurrently while taking Ivermectin, and it's something else not related to the drug?\n\nTl;dr: took pills, made me twitch, stopped taking pills, still twitching and experiencing new symptoms almost 3 weeks later. Could pills cause continual and worsening neurological damage even after halting their use? Or is it something else?\n\nFor anyone that read this: thank you. This is really hard for me to deal with, considering it most likely involves my central nervous system.\nOther information: 20 y/o female. no known allergies/genetic family disorders. currently not on any medication. been dealing with an undiagnosed ear dysfunction since around 16 (hyperacusis, tinnitus, ear pressure, occasional dizziness).

I am an active 25 y/o male and practice hot yoga and weightlifting, so at first I thought I may have tweaked something in my arm and would practice massaging/rolling techniques in that area which didn't help.

Initially it looked like a smooth, black pellet, like it could have been stone or rubber. I assumed it was a gallstone because I discovered it in my BM. It was smooth and solid black at first but it split to reveal it was actually a squishy, sticky (think of tar, or bread dough that needs more flour) black material encased in a clear-ish plastic coating. I have no idea what it could be. I can't detect any serial numbers or stamps anywhere on it. This is now the second time I've passed one of these.\n\nFirst and foremost, before anyone tells me to see a doctor, I actually showed this to an ER doctor today, and he said \"yeah that's crazy haha\" and dismissed me.  He's given me medicine for colitis after discovering my colon was inflamed (likely from having foreign bodies in it) and then when I got home I discovered the medicine has strong reactions with multiple of my current medications and had a warning on the front of the prescription and bottle -- both the pharmacist and doctor said \"huh, I've never heard of that\". But anyways, that's neither here nor there. I have a lifelong history of bad experiences with medicines and doctors so unfortunately it's nothing new. \n\nWhen I first passed the 'pellet' I saw it was black, assumed it was a gallstone, fished it out of my poop without investigating it because I'm very much a germaphobe, and went to the hospital. My mistake was perhaps in not looking at it; I went to the ER for gallstones because I was dead-set on that diagnosis. It was clearly not a gallstone.\n\nI have passed one of these before. I do not have a Driver's License so I tried to show my mother (who would be my driver for a medical visit) and she said \"there's no way you passed a gallstone\" and flushed it without looking. Of course, now I know it wasn't a gallstone. But it probably would have been whatever this is, and it would have been nice to be seen for this earlier. But the evidence got flushed, and I never followed up with it. That was several months ago.\n\nI feel like I've been experiencing my symptoms -- nausea, fever and flushness, constipation and diarrhea, abdominal pains (mostly on the right), loss of appetite, and others -- since my most recent colonoscopy/endoscopy. I mainly would like to know if there is any sort of medical equipment that could have been left inside me. This would have been a year and a half or maybe two years ago.\n\nI do not take any medicines that are black. I have never put something in my body that looks like this, ever. I have extraordinary memory and cannot recall an object of this type ever entering my body, at least not through my mouth. And I have never inserted anything through my rectum, so anything that reached my intestines that way was not put there by me.\n\nIf anyone recognizes this object, please let me know.\n\nTelling you all of this unrelated stuff because I have to: 22 y/o, female, 5ft7in, Caucasian white, United States, medications yes -- will disclose if deemed important but don't have my list on me right now", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I am not here looking for a diagnosis but for suggestions as to what I should have doctors look into next as they don't know themselves what to check so I'm trying to figure it out for myself so I can point them in the right direction.  \n\nThe first issue was digestive issues that started around 6 years ago, I have had an endoscopy where they took a biopsy and they said everything looks fine. My stools used to be very loose but the last couple years haven't been too bad, though I still have to use the toilet 5+ times per day (to poop).  \n\nThen around 5 years ago I had a case of Labrynthitis (inner ear viral infection) and all my other symptoms seemed to start exactly at this time so I'm sure the virus has triggered this (which is why I suspect autoimmune). The symptoms are as follows:  \nDry mouth  \nFatigue  \nNeurological decline (memory, problem solving skills have gone to shit)  \nExcessive sweating  \nDerealisation  \nSensitivity to loud noise  \nSensitivity to bright light (particularly sunlight)  \nBalance/coordination problems  \nJoint problems (stupid amount of injuries from working out even though I use good form and don't lift heavy)  \nAlcohol intolerance (get drunk much easier and hangovers are 10 times worse than previously, rarely drink more than a pint or 2 now) \nWounds take a long time to heal  \n\nI was also diagnosed with psoriasis and Raynauds at a young age, had what doctors told me was a psoriasis guttate flair recently and it has cleared on my body but my head is still sore/itchy and it's causing bald patches on my scalp.  \n\nI have had many blood tests in this time, and have been negative for everything except for slightly elevated liver enzymes but I have had both an ultrasound scan and a fibroscan on my liver and everything is fine. Have been tested for T1, T2 and insipdous diabetes, kidney functions, ANA and all were negative.

Before anyone tells me to go see a doctor I have 2 reasons: One it seems like the treatments are really lacking I don't see a point in wasting time. 2nd main reason I have bad insurance I am in NY and since I am self employed I have chosen the cheapest I had to get. I may be getting married within the next year I will go to the doctor then as my GF is a teacher.\n\nI suspect I either have CFS, Fibromyalgia, or Sleep apnea but as I mentioned I will try to get an official diagnosis soon but not now due to my insurance. I tried posting in a CFS chat room a few months ago but it seems like my symptoms are mild I guess and I was laughed out of the room. I'm definitely not bed ridden but I am in pain and have brain fog it sucks. Can Fibromyalgia be mild?\n\nSo about me: I am self employed and I'm lucky enough to have been successful on my marketing business and work from home. I'm currently 30 years old, male, I'm overweight around 290lb 5'9. I feel my success in my work was due to my symptoms not being too bad when I was younger but around late 2017 until today it just feels harder to work, go to the gym and work on my hobbies. Below I'll list many of the symptoms I experience. I seem to get more flare ups always on the weekends. Maybe I am less stressed and my body feels it can relax and maybe I sleep too much and have a shittier diet during the weekend? I do get them during the week too but maybe 2 out of the 5 days. Thursday and Fridays seem to be the worse I literally can't work sometimes and just veg out on my bed.\n\nSymptoms -Fatigue even though I sleep 6-10 hours a day. It feels like the less sleep I sleep sometimes I feel better and less lethargic but not always sometimes it makes symptoms worse. I just feel tired all the time. Unless I take my stimulants I cannot work, do errands, or even read stuff online. The most I can do is watch videos while I wait for the stimulants to take effect.\n\n\\-Random body pains and aches on my neck, upper back under the shoulder blades. Both shoulder joints sometimes burn and ache for no reason. My neck seems to be always tight.\n\n\\-Hip and knee joints are sometimes hard to move.\n\n\\-Pain in both forearms right below the bicep.\n\n\\-Pain in both hands in all fingers except thumbs like I have arthritis.\n\n\\-My plantar fasciitis seems to be worse on some days even if I just sat on my chair or bed and barely walked. Some days have no pain at all even though I walked or worked out.\n\n\\-If I do manage to go to the gym I only go 1-2 times a week and maybe have the energy to do 30-40 mins of cycling. Many times after working out the next 1-2 days I have bad brain fog and am very lethargic. My body feels like it was hit by a truck. Some of it is DOMS but I use to got to gym 3 times a week very consistently and go running. I was always overweight but lighter I use to be 250-270 I would fluctuate. I use to powerlift some serious weight 620lb deadlift, squatting 525lb pounds benching 350lb. Now I still try to lift but I become very fatigue and unmotivated because I don't want to be useless for the next 2-3 days because I wanted to lift heavy and workout.\n\n\\-Random bouts of brain fog. Hard to think. I play a lot of video games to take breaks. I play fighting games competitively. I can see the real effects of brain fog I lose more matches, I'm not \"on\". I make stupid mistakes. Versus on my good days with no pain or brain fog I play very well.\n\n\\-Sometimes it feels I worked out even though it has been days since I went to the gym and my abs, legs and arms are sore like I have done a light work out but maybe all I did all day was sit, layed around or walked.\n\nI've had all these symptoms since I was a little kid but just chocked it up to growing pains for the pain or that I worked out too much(I use to wrestle and play football as a kid). Brain fog and fatigue I just thought I was depressed I was a real moody kid back then but my life is pretty great I have a awesome GF, we travel, have fun. My parents are still alive but they're getting old and their bodies are breaking down. And my business is very successful and still is even with my symptoms getting worse.\n\nBUT the pain, brain fog, tiredness, I feel like I'm being held back. I feel like I'm being lazy. I get anxiety attacks now because I feel like I'm not like my old self and I can't even work than a few hours without needing a few hours break and then the whole day is over and I have to go to sleep. It seems to be getting worse I have to take a lot of days off to stay home and recover and sleep and just lay around because I really don't want to move or work anymore.\n\nEven though my business is successful in reality I am barely holding it together by taking frequent breaks but I see the downward slope. This year was the worst I have been in my business I have gotten less clients because I don't have the energy to go out and meet people like I use to and the brain fog I have on most days is making me do dumb mistakes and my motivation for anything is at an all time low.\n\nThe only thing that seems to make me better and cope with everything seems to be Caffeine, Ephedra, Kratom, Marijuana, Nicotine, alcohol(Not often) and ibuprofen. I take all of these substances on the daily just to get through the day and not have my business crumble. I know none of this is good for me my liver enzymes have been slightly high for the past few years but I have tried stopping everything and all the symptoms I described are 5x worse. I can't function without these. Ibuprofen use to really clear everything up with my brain fog and pain but I feel like its not as effective as it use to be. I really don't want to find a new substance to rely on I'm not sure what to do. There are sometimes I either don't take some of these or I take very little but it seems like those days are dwindling and I'm taking these substances more often as time goes on.\n\nSorry for the long post I guess this turned into a rant but it felt good to get this out and maybe I'll get some validation on what I think I have. I'm so frustrated with my body I don't know what is wrong with it. I guess any advice and thoughts would help. I appreciate it, thank you for listening to me. Am I just working too much? Am I just too stressed out? If so wtf are these body pains that I can't move or don't want to move at all. I feel like I have so much I want to do and I feel bad for my GF I probably seem less energetic than I was when she first met me.

I am at my wits end trying to get a diagnosis &amp; could use some opinions from fresh sets of eyes. I am a 24 year old female &amp; about 3 years ago I started getting pain and swelling in my hands (particularly between the knuckles of my index and middle fingers). I didn't think much of it at the time as I was a student and constantly writing. After a few months it went away, but when it resurfaced that summer, my knees were also painful and swollen. I went to a doctor &amp; had normal xrays, ultra sounds, &amp; MRIs (the only abnormality was synovitis in my knee)&amp; blood work for Lyme disease came back negative. I was sent to a rheumatologist who considered Lupus or RA &amp; ordered blood work done. The blood work came back mostly normal- the only abnormality being a slightly raised ANA (1:80 homogeneous pattern). He said he would not rule out something like early lupus but (understandably) could not justify making a diagnosis at this point. He recommended going to another rheum for another opinion (which I absolutely will) but I also figured it couldn't hurt to reach out to this subreddit to see if this sounds familiar. Is there anything we might be missing that we could look into? Some other things my Drs have asked about that might be significant: Symptoms are not constant, but come and go seemingly at random. I have a significant family history of autoimmune diseases I sometimes get rashes from being in the sun and it can absolutely drain my energy. I get mouth sores rather frequently. I frequently run a low grade fever. When I am in a period of symptoms acting up, the fatigue REALLY kicks my ass. My wrists, elbows, and knees are all hyperflexible but I have never had an issue with dislocations or anything like that. My fingers and toes cannot handle the cold anymore. They go white and numb even if it's just a little chilly. Now, in addition to my hands and knees, my hips and elbows are also involved with the pain (though they don't seem as bad on the swelling front)\n\nI have been to about half a dozen doctors and every one is stumped.

Muscle relaxers work but shortly after taking one I noticed a new sound in my one ear that reacts to other sounds.

It continues to get more bothersome each day and then the fluttering of the muscle in that ear started, although only when I'm lying down for the most part.\n\nCan tight muscles in my neck be the root of the issue? And could the pain be causing the clenching ... or is the clenching causing the pain and the muscles to get tight?

If I eat carbs or sugar, it can last for hours. Veggies and protein typically less than an hour. Exercise helps it, as an increased heart rate from exercise is regular without skipping. I've seen my PCP, but she told me to get more potassium and it's not big deal. But it is making me miserable. I've had blood testing, which I detail below, but it's not diabetes.\n\nNow the longer version, based on my post on r/AskDocs, where I haven't yet gotten any suggestions.\n\nI\u2019ve got a couple weird issues going on, and I don\u2019t know if they are related, so I\u2019ll go chronologically.\n\nAbout 6 months back, I had a sinus infection after a cold. I lost the ability to smell for a couple months, and when it came back, everything smelled the same. As in, cooking dinner smells the same as picking up dog poop. I describe it as smelling like burnt flowers, but I think that just may be association because I was in AZ at the time and the palo verde trees were blooming. Interestingly enough, it doesn\u2019t affect chemical smells, so I passed the smell test the ENT gave me. But everything else \u2013 burnt flowers. Fortunately, I have my wife to smell things to make sure they aren\u2019t spoiled. Taste has been affected minimally. Around this time I also started doing 16/8 intermittent fasting. Not sure if that is notable.\n\nIn late July, I started getting heart palpitations after eating. Basically skipping beats every 3-30 beats for a couple hours after lunch, more than a couple after dinner. Started the next day feeling fine. Eating sugar or carbs made things worse. On the plus side, it made me eat mostly vegetables and proteins, so I\u2019ve lost 25 lbs. The bad news is that it continues. I also feel pressure in my sinuses, which seems to be worsening. It feels like my blood pressure goes up as well, but I have a cuff to monitor and it doesn\u2019t actually change. My pulse quickens from about 75 to about 95 bpm. Going for a walk after eating or exercising to get my heart rate up seems to help. Stress sometimes seem to trigger them and sitting seems to make things worse (but doesn\u2019t in itself trigger them). Occasionally I feel nauseous, but I don't know if that's partly because I find the issue itself a little stressful. I recently changed from the intermittent fasting back to three meals per day, and it seemed to help a bit with the heart issue, but really it varies in intensity from day to day.\n\nI\u2019ve been to a few doctors along the way.\n\nIn June, I went to urgent care because I felt like my nose and chest were sort of burning when breathing and I had just noticed the smell issue. This was before the palpitations. The PA prescribed antibiotics for the sinus infection (which she said seemed to be lingering) and told me to use Flonase or similar. She also did an EKG, which she described as \u201cperfect, with no anomalies.\u201d I did the full course of antibiotics and used Flonase for a while. Neither seemed to help and I stopped the Flonase.\n\nI moved to MD in August, and finding the recent palpitations concerning, I went to a primary care physician. She did an EKG and said that I was having PVCs (premature ventricular contractions) and that they weren\u2019t an immediate cause for concern. She said to increase my potassium. It seemed to work for a short time. She was more concerned about the smell issue and referred me to an ENT. She also did a physical, urinalysis, and blood work (basic metabolic, and I think stuff to check kidney function?) to rule out diabetes and other issues I can't recall entirely. Everything came back in normal range (with potassium on the higher side of normal).\n\nI went to an ENT who scoped my nose (nothing of interest) and had me do an MRI. The MRI showed nothing of interest as well (no growths, nothing in the brain of concern). He says the sinus infection likely damaged the nerves. They may self-repair, they may not, but nothing to be done. If it stay this way for a year, it's probably permanent. Which I\u2019m fine with. I find the PVCs and sinus pressure after eating to be far more bothersome anyway.\n\nI\u2019m open to possible diagnoses, but primarily I am looking to see what specialists I should see to check this out. Fortunately, I have good health insurance ($20 co-pay, no referral required for specialists), so I\u2019m happy to use the heck out of it. I just don\u2019t know who to see and my PCP seemed unconcerned even when I raised the issue during a follow-up appointment. She just recommended more potassium.\n\nThanks!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I come from two families with various disabilities: I have three autistic siblings, multiple autistic relatives on my dad's side, a few relatives with schizophrenia, and anxiety/panic disorder seems to run on my mom's side.\n\nI've never had any learning disability or mental evaluations as a kid, however I did see a psychologist for a brief few sessions to work on severe social phobia and depression (which was deemed as caused by my social phobia, but we didn't have much time to discuss depression in general). After years of working on it, my social phobia is under control and now only has minor occurrences in my life. However I feel I am facing different mental health problems I can't seem to put my finger on. After much thought, I've narrowed it down to either OCD, Bipolar Disorder, or ADHD, or a mix of any of those three, but I'd like another opinion on my symptoms.\n\n* **I have a ridiculously hard time staying focused/motivated on projects.** I have a lot of hobbies, but find myself lying on the floor not doing anything because I can't decide what to do, and when I do sit down to do something, I'll either give up because I'm not interested in doing that right now, or I become hyper-fixated on the project and will do it without a break for multiple hours straight. For example: I like to paint, if I get into a painting mood, I will paint for like, 4-6 hours straight without taking *any* breaks, not even to use the restroom, because it will disrupt my workflow and I would be unable to paint once I stop. If I try to sit down and paint without that obsessive drive, I simply become frustrated and give up or browse my phone for hours in front of my blank canvas. I've been told that while it's normal to experience blocks, what I seem to be experiencing is a lot less healthy than the average person, who can take breaks and consistently work on a piece over a long period of time. Once I'm out of the zone, or I become bored, I have zero motivation to work on the project at all and scrap it completely if it's not done. \n* **I'm obsessed with sterile cleanliness, particularly with my hands.** I wash my hands frequently and use single-use gloves whenever I clean or touch anything I'd consider gross because reuseable gloves will accumulate bacteria inside them over time. I don't allow my nails to grow long because bacteria can grow under them easier. Shaking people's hands when greeting them has always been a silent nightmare because it's like I can FEEL every little bacteria they just put on me, and I carry hand sanitizer with me at all times.\n* **I'm easily distracted and procrastinate on projects.** I've never read a single textbook for school and every project I've worked on, I would wait until the night before and then pull an all-nighter up until the due date, with no sleep. Even now, I have a hard time reading long paragraphs or staying focused on videos or conversations longer than 3 minutes.\n* **I'm fidgety.** I've seen video recordings of myself and in each one I am not sitting still, I'm always rocking in my chair, touching/fixing my hair even when it doesn't need to be moved, or swinging my body back and forth. It's very strange to see when I am next to other people who can sit still and I'm bouncing all over the place while they talk. This might be a remnant of my social phobia as my therapist had noticed it as an anxiety tic when I talk to people. I've found a lot of comfort in fidget toys like spinners and activity cubes. \n* Along with the above, **I talk really fast, and people are always asking me to repeat myself slower.** I tend to explain too much information too quickly and I've been penalized in speech-based classes for talking too quickly.\n* **I have a lot of disturbing, intrusive thoughts that I can't turn off.** It's kept me from sleeping numerous times. The worst is when I think about how there are people suffering in the world, like victims of human trafficking or slavery, and the thought just disturbs me for hours and hours and I can't make it go away no matter what I try to distract myself with.\n* Alongside the first point, **I have a hard time committing to things I've lost interest in.** I haven't held a job for longer than a year because I get disinterested or I suddenly forget how to do the job?\n* With the above point, **I seem to experience a brain fog of some sorts from time to time**, where I just feel too stupid and unaware of my surroundings. When people talk to me, it's like it goes in one ear and out the other. This proved to be detrimental at my last job, which I failed at because I couldn't perform the work no matter how many times they repeated the training to me. It was a jarring experience because in the job before this, I was the fastest learner and even went above and beyond consistently. I have zero memory of my childhood except for the multiple times teachers have called me out because I was zoning out in class (this public humiliation ended up being a major part of my social phobia). Recently, I feel like my brain fog has worsened, or if I've become a lot more aware of it with my performance at my recent job and new driver's license.\n* **I need background music playing at all times.** If it's silent, I start to feel like I'm going crazy and become restless and make my own music via humming/tapping/drumming on any surface.\n* **I miss little details and have a hard time paying attention.** This is especially bad whenever I drive- I seem to barely survive near-car accidents almost 90% of the time I drive because I had missed a car approaching or a pedestrian nearby. Yesterday I missed a car in my blind spot and nearly hit them if they hadn't moved out of the way. I quit my last job because they penalize harshly if you miss a single detail like a typo, and I was getting punished a lot for it.\n* **I zone out a lot.** I zone out when people talk to me, when I'm driving, when I'm working. I just stare at a wall or the sky and don't think of anything at all. People who have noticed this find it really annoying.\n* **I experience irrational moods/energy spikes for unknown reasons.** Some days I will just wake up and I'm incredibly depressed, unmotivated, and sometimes even dangerously suicidal. Nothing bad is required to happen, I just suddenly feel hopeless and sad and can't get off the floor. Other days, I wake up and I have the energy to do a thousand things and can literally run for four hours straight. Sometimes in that energized mood I get this YOLO attitude where I spend large amounts of money frivolously and do things impulsively without thinking, which I end up regretting later.\n* **I become unhealthily fixated on failure and mistakes.** If I make a single mistake, I start to make more mistakes, as if I've lost control of myself. This is really bad while driving and if I make one traffic infraction, even if no one sees it I need to pull over for a few minutes and gather myself. I'm a bit of a perfectionist and if things don't go exactly as I need them to, or if I mess up, I dwell on it for hours and punish or put myself down harshly. I used to cut, but I don't do this anymore! I think this just ties in with the intrusive thoughts, it's like I can't turn off the degrading voice in my head whenever I make even the tiniest mistake.\n\nI used to pass off a lot of these things as normal, but the more I talk to others about it the more I'm finding that these things aren't actually normal for people? My question is, what could I most likely be experiencing with all this? And what kind of doctor am I supposed to see to get a proper evaluation? Is there a way to fix absentmindedness and intrusive thoughts or am I just eternally stupid and plagued with an uncontrollable brain and body forever?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Not to get too nitty gritty but my response to sex is insane and extremely inconvenient. I haven\u2019t had sex in over a year because I\u2019m just avoiding the whole situation. It just that sex feels so good that I get this really intense head high from it and I can\u2019t stop laughing. Like, I physically can\u2019t stop and will laugh uncontrollably the entire time. I will slur my words and won\u2019t have the ability to answer simple questions. I\u2019ve even forgotten my own name and where I was. I\u2019m usually comically tired afterwards during my come down. The effects usually last about an hour after I have sex so it has always had to be a scheduled thing since I can\u2019t be taken out in public afterwards.

I really only feel normal and completely myself the first 1 1/2-2 weeks of the month. Once I hit my fertile window I feel like a completely person. I don\u2019t feel as connected to the world around me, my focus is off, memory is fizzier, I cry all the time, and I eat like a horse. During ovulation is when I feel my most unstable and will break down in tears over anything. Right after that ends, I hop immediately into PMSing. My breasts hurt, my appetite is still pretty crazy, I\u2019m extremely irritable, and I feel so lethargic and fatigued. It feels borderline painful to work out and if I do it\u2019s normally about half what I normally do with me pushing myself as hard as I can. My body just feels SO heavy. I can tell the day I am going to get my period because it feels like a fog lifts and I am finally back to normal. \n\nIm not sure what could be causing this and googling hasn\u2019t done much. The closest I\u2019ve gotten is PMDD but it doesn\u2019t account for my response to sex since that is constant. Or, why I am also effected by my fertile window.

I have been playing phone tag to find out what the next step is with that or if they think it's that bad, as I read my results through the patient portal and have been working late when the office closes. \n\nThere was a long list of symptoms in that first post. Many of those are still an issue. Fatigue is a big one. The bone pain in my left elbow (not sure if I mentioned) is still there, my other bones are tender when gently pressed. Not sure if related. \n\nMy question is: when someone has many gallstones, what is the most COMMON procedure to fix it, should it be deemed a concern? Is it usually surgery across the board? How long after surgery until you can get off bed rest? I understand everyone is different and therefore will get a different procedure and treatment. I am asking what are the chances I am on bed rest more than a week? I just started a new job and I don't want to risk losing it as it is my dream job. \n\nTL;DR I followed up on many symptoms and it appears I have many gallstones.

Though it is more common for me to walk to a place in the house and forget why I walked there (This occurs several times a day, though some days this can be less frequent). I also seem to sometimes forget words mid-sentence, slur my words, lose all focus (like day dreaming but without any thoughts or anything) and my perception of time can be very out of touch with reality.\n\nAlso I seem to faint occasionally, normally its once every two weeks, however it can become more regular up to several times a week.\n\nHowever, I am unsure if it could be considered as fainting as I always remain conscious to some degree. This seems to always occur after I get up (not in a rush, just normally) from something such as a chair (doesn\u2019t really matter how long I have been sitting, it still occurs even after short periods), or sometimes just randomly while standing (less common though). The sensation can be short were I only lose some of my vision and hearing (combined with some ringing) while losing some control of my posture (I slump a little, or feel very weak) for approximately four seconds. \n\nOr it can be the complete loss of sight and hearing (except a obnoxious ringing) where I lose control of my movement (I just go floppy) with sometimes a bizarre vibrating/wobbling sensation (like being shaken violently) for what feels like up to fifteen seconds. However I should note that I also daily experience a minor state of vision loss (vision just goes a patchy/granular black, like the static of a tv creeping from normally the borders of my vision) when I sometimes lean over to pick up something.\n\nHowever there also some minor things, such as occasional muscle cramps, cold hands and cold feet (and no I don\u2019t live in a cold climate). And as of the last month I seem to get sometimes weird \u201csplit\u201d cold and warm hands where either one or both hands have the last three digits (middle to little finger including some of the palm) very cold and kind of numb even though the rest of my hand and arm were warm (I found this kind of weird because I wasn\u2019t holding anything or obstructing any blood flow from pressure on my arm).\n\nAll of this seems to have started at 12 with feeling tired for no reason coupled with for the next three years (I have no idea why) a habit to choke on water or any other liquid, then came muscle cramps in my legs and feet (perhaps this is simply normal for that time in life), then the fainting and the constant sensation of being mentally exhausted (also weird shooting pain in my stomach when I woke up, don't know if that's relevant). However I distinctly remember instead of cold feet and hands I had always unusually hot/cooking feet and hands at night. \n\nFinally I should say that I have never smoked or done any drugs of any sort and I don\u2019t drink, nor am I sleep deprived or as far as I know a diabetic. And I don\u2019t live at my desk (I have never found gaming particularly enjoyable unlike many of my generation) nor do I live on a high sugar diet (I must sound like an old man but ice-cream and soft drinks gross me out). I also had several tests on my heart (which seems normal), an epilepsy test (normal yet again), a sleep study (which was normal) and a MRI scan (normal). However I do seem to have iron deficiency that has been managed (does make the fainting occur less), however it hasn\u2019t solved much.

Sometime later (can't remember when precisely) a cist erupted on my skin. It looked like a pimple at firts and it was itchy. After a while the itchiness disappeared but the cist is still there today.\n\nA while later two more cists appeared, and more and more kept appearing thourhgout the years.\n\nRight now I have around 20 cists on my skin in different regions of the body, mostly my arms and legs. Six more appeared on my left arm a week ago. When this things appear I feel sick with fever and headhaces. These symptoms remain for about 14 days, fading away day by day, nothing too strange here though, it could be any illness.\n\nAround 8 years ago I got worried about the cists stuff and I started to look for an explanation. I asked my doctor and my dermatologist about the cists (I think I had just 3 of them at the time), they both said that I was worring about nothing. Still, I googled this stuff to try and find an explanation and found about onchocercasis and worms like that. Presenting the information to my family, everybody just thought that I was acting crazy, and rightfully so, since I had just one symptom out of many. I tried to forget about all this, I just have 14 days a year where I get worried sick about my immaginary worms, when the cists appear, then I forget about it for the rest of the year.\n\nBut a week ago six more of these things appeared, all during the same day. I searched again for the symptoms of my hypotetical diseases and lo and behold, in the past years I suffered more of those symptoms without even knowing. Even worse, no medic could actually explain those symptoms. Here they are:\n\n\\- enlarged liver. Got an ecography after the values of my liver came out wrong, this was 6 years ago. A year later I repeated the exam, the blood values were ok but the liver was still enlarged.\n\n\\- random swellings. 6 years ago my left foot swell, like there was a bubble of 7/8cm in diameter and 2cm height in the flat top part of the foot. The swelling disappeared after 2 days but the foot still hurted for about a month, first days I couldn't even walk because of the pain. The doctor gave me pain killers while being unable to explain the swelling.\n\n\\- pulmonary symptoms, since five year I constantly suffer from cough with brown catarrh expulsions. No explanations from my doctor, he prescribed me some different antibiotics treatments that actually helped for a while but then the cough comes back again.\n\n\\- of course, the cists.\n\nI also suffers from the other generic symptoms\n\nAnd finally, here's the illness I'm talking about:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansonella\\_ozzardi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansonella_ozzardi). Could be also other related infections with similar symptoms, it's just that this one seems to be the most probable due to the areas where you could contract it.\n\nI have to get rid of this doubt but I can't convince any doctor about taking some tests for this. My guess is that I just appear too damn calm, as I always am, and they think that I don't feel sick or worried about this. But I am, I wan't to know if my body has been playing tricks to me for the past 10 years or if I've actually contracted this illness or a similar one.\n\nHow tf can I proceed with getting tested for this?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Around an hour after the orgasm i start to feel pain in various areas such as inside the urethrae, specific spots along the left side of the testicles, sometimes between the testicles. The pain is like a stinging and pressure, it usually last only for a brief moment and vanishes again.

Then i will get a sharp sting inside my penis and clear fluids together with a bit blood will slowly leak out of my penis. My urethrae will be swollen for a day or two, but after this is over, all my symptoms will be gone for good, till the next time i have sex/masturbate again... Then this cycle repeats. I went weeks without sex/masturbation before but it didn't cure my condition, i also tried to drink antibacterial teas.\n\nI have my own theory that it could be related to the vas defers or cowpers gland but i have no knowledge in the field just what i gathered from google.

I wouldn't describe it as pain, it's just really uncomfortable.\n\nI've had this problem for a while now (28F), so at this point I never listen to headphones in only my right ear (has to be left only or both), I use my left ear to talk on the phone, and if I have to bend in the listen to someone talk quietly I will position myself so my left ear is closest to the person who is talking.  I stop my husband when he whispers in my right ear and ask him to switch ears.  \n\nThis hasn't been too much of an issue until today.

The drilling is so insanely loud and is focused on my right side, my back immediately tensed up.  I had to grip the arms of the chair to try and not twitch or convulse, but there were especially loud moments where my full body jumped involuntarily.  We actually had to stop after the first tooth because my dentist was so concerned about me.  I had to explain that I was in no amount of pain and had stopped feeling anxious due to how numb I was, but I could feel the nerves tingling uncomfortably all the way down the right side of my back until it hit the one spot where my muscles squeezed up.\n\nHe suggested I make an appointment with an ENT doctor, which I absolutely will.  I realize now I can't deal with my dental needs with this problem going on, and it's not a normal problem to have.  But I figured let's see if the good people of reddit can help identify potential causes or things I should bring up with the doctor to make sure the appointment goes well and the issue is thoroughly examined.\n\nI guess a little bit of extra information:  In college I feel out of a bunk bed while climbing in and hit my back on one of the stair rungs.  For about 6 months after that incident my right foot would occasionally go totally numb and limp for abut 15 minutes.  Occasionally I get very loud ringing in my right ear accompanied by back pain.  I have gone to a few concerts and listened to my fair share of music at too-loud-teenage type volumes.  The last time I had dental work done on that side I don't think I had this issue, that was maybe 1-2 years after the falling out of the bed incident and about 9 years ago from now.  \n\nThank you for reading this far and thank you if you can help.

I was in the military at the time and was quite fit. The tiredness became showing weakness when I would lift weights to the point of fatigue and not being able to use my hands very well hours later. This was uncommon since I had a very strong grip. It got to the point I just stopped since it was annoying.\n\nI went to an occupational therapist and did that for 6 months using various hand exercises, where the therapist tries to strengthen my grip which I had told them wasnt the problem. My grip did get stronger that time period, though the issue was weakness because of repetition. This therapy did not work. I also received an EMG to look at my nerves, which came back normal. I also received xrays of my arms to look for carpal tunnel and arthritis. It got to the point where my primary care doctor told me he didnt know what was wrong. I gave up and stopped going to doctors. At this point in had seen various specialists for about 1.5 years without any results.\n\nI left military service and went to school. In school I couldn't and still cant really write. After about a paragraph my hands are weak and it makes it difficult to hold the pen. Also I noticed that me knees start to hurt when I bend down and stand back up. After about a 1.5 years I finally got fed up of not being able to use my hands well again and went to see a different primary care doctor. This one was really proactive and I had more exrays and a CT scan on my spine, with no abnormalities. He finally referred me to a another neurologist. I chose the best one I could find in my city and went there. After about 30 minutes with him he said I had some odd things going on that should not be happening. After 2 appointments with him he said that he thought I had some sort of myopathy, but he didnt know what exactly. He said it was odd enough that he suggested I go to the Mayo Clinic if I could afford it, at the time I could, so I went. I should note during this time were some of those worst painful months I have had. I would wake up and get out of bed and my knees would be on fire. I was also just having a hard time grasping things at work and my hands were just always hurting.\n\nAfter about a week at the Mayo Clinic, the neurologists there determined that I didnt have anything diagnosable. Though I had some odd things going on they couldn't outright say. Though they did say something could be in its early stages.\n\nAfter that I just gave up. I am just living with it. I dont have insurance now so that is a barrier as well. I should say during this entire time I havent stopped doing things with my hands. I do work around the house, lift heavy things. When I do lift heavier things there is a lot of pain in my finger joints and after my hands are hard to move.\n\nI just dont know who to turn to at this point.\n\nTLDR: Hand weakness and hand joint pain. Been through neurology at Mayo clinic, have had xrays and CT scan of spine. Still dont know what is going on.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

No burning sensation, but more frequent urination. Felt maybe it was a UTI coming on, so took some cranberry pills and drank lots of water. Tuesday and Wednesday, pretty much the same thing but still no burning sensation when urinating. I definitely noticed a more frequent urge to pee whenever I wore leggings to the gym in the evening (Mon, Tues and Wed). When at the gym each evening, I had to constantly go to the bathroom to just release a tiny bit of urine. The urge to pee was less noticeable during the day when I wore sweatpants.\n\nThursday evening however, I had to skip going to the gym entirely because the frequent urge to pee was just too much when I put on my leggings. I tried going to the gym but once in my car, it just felt like I had to pee within a few minutes so I turned around and went back home feeling like I had to pee the whole time. When I got out of the car and stood up, the urge to pee was less but still there. Went back inside my place and used the bathroom and this time there was a slight burning sensation when I peed. I spent a good deal of time (45 minutes?) just sitting on the toilet bc the frequent urge to pee was too much. I would periodically just drip urine while sitting there. That night, I ended up taking a second dose of cranberry pills and drinking even more water.\n\nToday, there is no burning at all when I pee and I woke up and didn't feel a super urge to pee like I have the past few mornings. BUT I still am peeing frequently. There is not a huge urgency like last night but there is a continuous urge to pee (but I'm also drinking lots of water!). And there is a sort of pressure in my abdomen as well but I think it's also bc I'm drinking a shit ton of water so I'm bloated af.\n\nWorth noting, on the Sunday prior to all this, I did have a lot of sex and didn't do a great job of cleaning up after.\n\nSo is this a UTI, a mild UTI or nothing? Should I just continue with water and cranberry pills and wait it out? And is sex off the table?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

This last year I have been noticing that the skin starting just above his ankles all the way down to his toes is darker and more shiny than the skin anywhere else on his body. The numbness has progressed so much that he can no longer drive or run because he cant feel any normal sensation in his feet at all. This last week, he got a new pair of shoes and he was limping because one of his feet hurt so much. I asked him why his foot hurt and he said his shoes didnt fit his arches very well. I didnt make a big deal out of it and just said that he should keep from wearing those shoes anymore since I'm already worried about his feet. He is also the type of guy to refuse to go to the doctor till he is almost dead. Today, I got home and my mother told me that my dad had been walking in the garden and he heard/felt a snap in his foot and a lot of pain with it.

It had been a few partners since my last test and had decided that I should get checked. I did have a pimple on my genitals but I wasn't concerned because I had just shaved and had had bumps like that before. Also during the test to the doctor told me it was nothing to worry about.\n\nThe next day (Tuesday) I noticed that my ankles and lower calves were quite itchy which I just attributed to having worn my socks for a long time that day. I know sometimes I'll get a mild itch.\n\nThursday I received a call from the testing center that I tested positive for gonorrhea in my throat. I wish I could say I was surprised but I'm not great at safe sex practices. Anyway that same day I noticed that my arms seemed slightly red as if they had received a mild sunburn which I didn't think anything more of simply because I know that when I drive I will leave my arms on the window and I have gotten mild Burns like that before.\n\nI contacted all my partners from the last 90 days and alerted them of my diagnosis and that they should get themselves tested as well. One of those partners and I decided that we would go up Friday morning so that I could receive treatment and then she could get tested and received treatment as well. I stayed over at her place Thursday night and we ended up engaging in tantric sex (sex in which I did not orgasm.) We went to the testing center, both received treatment (the shot and oral pills,) were told not to engage in sexual for 7 days, and were sent on our way.\n\nLater Friday evening I noticed that my throat became a bit sore and that the mucus was a bit thicker. I looked and saw a canker sore on my tonsil (which again seems normal to me. I have been prone my entire life to receiving canker sores) but it was a bit red and the the left side of the back of my throat had small white patches. In the past couple years I have previously had both mono and strep so these are symptoms I had also seen before. I also noticed, however, that the scratchiness on my ankles was still there and so I finally looked at it and notice that I had decent sized rashes on both legs, which are mostly just red spots speckled around. I saw some slight or rashes on both my lower inside right thigh as well as on the insides of both my arms (what I thought were the burns.) Lastly, I noticed it was painful if I pressed on my pelvis right above my genitals as well as on the right side going to where the pimple was. I can't be sure if this can be attributed to the tantric sex.\n\nI have done some minor research and it seems like all of these symptoms can be attributed to gonorrhea in their cases but I can't help but be concerned because they also seem like symptoms for worse diseases which I did not get tested for nor did I mark at the time of testing because I had not yet noticed them or they had not developed (namely HIV because I had given blood a few months ago and did not hear anything from that and herpes. It was an Express type clinic.) my energy levels have been the same as normal and I haven't felt feverish or any other symptoms like that.\n\nI know I just received my treatment 24 hours ago so I can't expect things to improve immediately but should I be concerned that this could be something more? I plan to go in to get an HIV test as soon as I can.\n\nTl;Dr\n\nI got diagnosed with gonorrhea in my throat.

The scar tissue was apparently \"scraped down\" and the hysterectomy was then completed.  \n\\-Developed body wide tenderness that quickly worsened (Was originally diagnosed as Fibromyalgia, but some doctors prefer \"Chronic pain syndrome w/ chronic fatigue\"  \n\\-Around 2009 was admitted to the hospital after slurred speech and unresponsiveness. Diagnosis was Diabetic KetoAcidosis (DKA) Her diabetic diagnosis was changed to type 1  \n\\-Began regularly vomiting which increased in intensity and duration over a few years. Was eventually diagnosed with severe gastroparesis.  \n\\-Monthly admissions with DKA and blood glucose average over 500. Even in the hospital setting it was extremely difficult to control and was regularly released from the hospital with a blood glucose over 300.  \n\\-A medport was implanted to allow her to receive antiemetics through her line and bypass the stomach. Her med port her been replaced about once a year due to infections that all seems to occur during the early part of the year (Jan-Mar)  \n\\-Additional diagnosis was added to her diabetes classifying her as a \"brittle diabetic\"  \n\\-An insulin pump was added to great effect, decreasing her average blood glucose from over 500 to around 350.  \n\\-Around 2015 she presented with greater than normal fatigue and exhaustion lab findings revealed tanked hemoglobin and haptoglobin. A transfusion was given.  \n\\-Diagnosed with chronic Hemolytic Anemia (Normocytic normochromic)  \n\\-Routine lab findings found that her liver enzyme levels were \"though the roof\" she was asymptomatic and a cause was never found. The elevated enzyme levels resolved on their own after about a year.  \n\\-Around 2016 she experienced a bout of severe anxiety and on several occasions got the feeling that she was \"going to die\" medications were adjusted and her mood and anxiety appeared to improve.  \n\\-In 2018 her depression worsened and was placed on IM abilify. Her anxiety hit an all time high and become crippling at times. This was later found to be a side effect of the abilify, and it was discontinued.  \n\\-Late Nov/early Dec. 2018 she began to notice/develop what she described as \"swelling\" in her stomach. An ultrasound was scheduled for Jan. 2019. Findings were ascites and organomegaly (hepatomegaly and splenomegaly) low dose diuretics were ordered.  \n\\-Was diagnosed with NASH (Non-alcoholic liver cirrhosis) Biopsy was done. Autoimmune hepatitis was ruled out.  \n\\-Routine testing was done and her potassium was critically low. Diuretics were stopped and I.V. replacement potassium therapy was administered. (To this day she experiences ZERO side effects from the hypokalemia)  \n\\-Within a week of the diuretics being stopped she gained over 40lbs in water weight. She was admitted to the hospital and had her water and potassium levels monitored hourly. During this time she required over 14 bags of potassium in a single day at one point (The most that ANY of her doctors have ever seen a patient need, and her nephrologist even called the hospital to confirm because she thought we were mistaken.)  \n\\-Is now going to the infusion center daily for potassium checks due to it dropping so fast (Just today she had to receive a 4 hour potassium infusion because she dropped in a single day from 3.5 to 2.6)\n\nNotable hematological/laboratory findings (In no particular order):\n\n\\-Hemolytic Anemia (Normocytic Normocromic)  \n\\-Elevated ANA (Nab/Titor was 1:640 with a speckled pattern)  \n\\-Severe Vitamin D Deficiency  \n\\-Intermittent Metabolic Alkalosis  \n\\-Severely elevated liver enzymes.

Her kidney function is fantastic and renal tubular acidosis has been ruled out. Her diabetes is leaps and bounds better than it was before the insulin pump but it remains fairly unpredictable which is quite puzzling due to the fact that she eats the same foods for weeks at a time (Due to her gastroparesis) and still swing from 400+ blood sugars to \"bottoming out\" within a day.

It has been driving me crazy, and I don't think my ENT has really been worth the time it took to see them. Part of the issue is some days I barely feel anything, and some days I can't focus on anything else. Although it has been quite some time since I couldn't feel it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt all started back in February-ish, when I mentioned it to my primary care physician she recommended omeprazole thinking it was GERD (I did have pretty bad reflux, so it made sense). That didn't help, and a few months later I told her. She referred me to an ENT. This was around May. I got in for a scope in July-ish, and had a swallow study done in the meantime. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe swallow study didn't show anything abnormal.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe scope didn't show anything, so the ENT recommended a double dose of omeprazole to see if it helped, and told me to check in a month later. A month went by, nothing changed, so I went in for another appointment and he told me to stop taking omeprazole completely to see if it got worse. It didn't change. His advice was to schedule another scope in February 2020. I asked for a CT scan, and he said no. I tried dealing with it, and made it about a month before calling again and saying I couldn't handle it. I got in for a CT scan in October. It showed nothing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI asked specifically about Eagle Syndrome, since it sounds similar and is in a similar location, but the ENT said my stylohyoid process is normal.

During this visit I kept passing out from the pain. Since then, (August 2) I have developed a stutter, have conic issues with passing out and have major non-stop dizziness. The dizziness is similar to being on a boat, not the room spinning.  BPV has been ruled out by my ENT. I have been tested for all known tick illness and nothing came back there. I have seen 6 different neurologist, all saying its not a neuro issue. I have had 1 MRI and 6 cat scans. It has been more than 3 months now and no one kind find anything to call it or how to treat it. I also seen a cardiologist, who rules out POTS with a 48hr heart monitor but have not done a tilt table test. My heart rate is high averaging around  90 at rest I have hit as high as 240 (2am while sleeping) but was told it is due to my wight. Just started blood pressure medication. Last blood pressure reading was 170/120. Nothing like this has happened to me before. I do have a family history of heart attacks on my father's side, and high blood pressure on my mother's. The only other medication I'm on is prilosec. All I've been told by everyone I see, is that they don't know what it is. Stroke and seizures have been ruled out. I barely drink and don't dabble in drugs.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBelow is some of the medical issue on my online chart that may or may not be useful. \n\n \n\nCat Scan FINDINGS: Brain: Hypodensity is identified in the region of the inferior left frontal lobe and anterior aspect of the left insula. This can be contributed by artifact involving the inferior frontal lobes, although an acute or subacute infarct cannot be excluded. Artifact limits evaluation of the pons. No acute intracranial hemorrhage. Midline shift: There is no midline shift. Ventricles: No ventriculomegaly. Bones/joints: The calvarium demonstrates no evidence for a depressed fracture. Sinuses: Visualized sinuses are unremarkable. No fluid levels. Mastoid air cells: No mastoid effusion. Soft tissues: Unremarkable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMRI FINDINGS: MRI of the brain was performed without IV injection of contrast using sagittal T1 with axial T1, T2, FLAIR, gradient-echo and diffusion.  \n\nNormal gray/white matter differentiation is visualized. There is no mass effect with no midline shift. There is no masslike lesion identified. There is no intra-axial and no extra-axial hemorrhage. The ventricular system is normal in size There is no acute infarction identified. Normal flow void signal is seen within the main intracranial arteries. There is no white matter signal abnormality seen on the FLAIR sequence.  \n\nMinimal degree of mucosal thickening is seen within the ethmoid air cells. The paranasal sinuses, orbits, mastoid air cells, posterior fossa, corpus callosum,, sella turcica, visualized cord and bones show no abnormality. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEAP CONVERSION BMP8+EGFR \u2010 L \u2010 Final result \ufd3e08/06/2019 8:01 AM EDT\ufd3f Component Value Ref Range  Pathologist Signature Glucose 95 70 \u2010 105 mg/dL\n\n Sodium 140 133 \u2010 145 mmol/L \n\n Potassium 4.1 3.3 \u2010 5.1 mmol/L\n\n Chloride 105 96 \u2010 108 mmol/L \n\n Carbon Dioxide 25 22 \u2010 32 mmol/L \n\n Creatinine 1.03 0.50 \u2010 1.20 mg/dL \n\n BUN 15 6 \u2010 20 mg/dL \n\n Calcium 9.2 8.4 \u2010 10.0 mg/dL \n\n Anion Gap 14.1 10.0 \u2010 20.0 \n\n \n\nCONVERSION TROPONIN I \u2010 Final result \ufd3e08/05/2019 12:50 PM EDT\ufd3f Component Value Ref Range Pathologist Signature Troponin I &lt;0.02 Comment: NOTE: An elevated Troponin level may be an indicator of ischemic myocardial damage.

My two boys have been tested with the same multiple allergy profile as I do and I'm so scared that if I don't figure this out I won't be able to save them from what I have. My daughter has no allergies.  I've been diagnosed with:\nAge 15\nTMJ diagnosis\nChronic back pain - chiro helps\nAge 21 \ntwo incidents of alopecia that spontaneously resolved with no treatment.  Brain scan and multiple tests; doctors conclude it's stress related.  I had large circular complete bald spots in my scalp. Both times the hair started growing back in a few months.  \nAge 25\nStarted experiencing extreme itchiness on my palms and soles.  3 weeks later I woke up and couldn't move. Had inflammation in many joints; primary took samples of knee inflammation, tested with no answers.  Conclusion: possible reactive arthritis with no clear cause. Two months later the symptoms disappeared.\nAge 28\nMassive trauma suffered when father died and I found him after three days.  Started EMDR and CBT.  \nAge 29\nMy hands and feet started itching again.  Returned to primary and told her I thought it was happening again. Pain symptoms re-emerged within two months.  Referred to rheumatologist. Negative ANA, all normal except elevated CRP. \nAge 29\nReferred to allergist, he finds very high copper levels and I am advised to take zinc supplements and avoid ingesting or handling copper.  Started on low dose minocycline as doc thinks my symptoms have an infectious source.  Allergic IGE response to most foods ranging from mild to moderate. Went on 6 month diet eliminating all allergens.  No improvement. Now I stay away from the bigger triggers - allium, cucumbers, strawberries, salmon.  Chronic pain.  Physio and tens doesn't work.  \nAge 30\nAfter not feeling better after treatment of kidney infection, urologist diagnoses interstitial cystitis\nAge 31\nRheumatologist 1 says fibro, rheumatologist says mild inflammatory arthritis and says I'm exaggerating pain.  CRP still solitary marker.  Primary diagnoses soft tissue pain as well as inflammation. \nAge 34 \nC-section, delivered twins\nAge 40 - developed psoriasis behind my ears.  Primary excited that I may get a proper diagnosis with this info - possible psoriatic arthritis. Psoriasis disappears suddenly after a year.\nAge 41\nC-section delivered single\nAge 43\nToddler son diagnosed with GDD and autism; through this I recieved additional diagnosis of ADHD and autism spectrum disorder.  10 year old son also diagnosed with both.\nAge 43\nAfter developing severe underarm rash from antiperspirant, and blisters on fingers and inside lip, I suspected aluminium allergy. Confirmed through naturopathic allergy testing.  Stopped antiperspirant use and rash cleared.  Stopped all processed foods and avoided aluminum.  Both sons also have the same allergy profile as I do including aluminum. I had to specifically request the aluminium screen as the allergist said it was rare and not normally tested. Allergy Response shown on most foods and all chemicals and metals.  My daughter has no allergies.  Tested negative on extensive Lyme screening and diagnosed with Multiple Chemical Sensitivity Syndrome.  \nAge 44 \nAfter 3 years of telling docs something was very wrong- I felt sick, dizzy and clammy all the time.  Holter monitor picks up inappropriate tachycardia, possible POTS.  Cardiologist stress test shows excercise intolerance - under slight stress on treadmill heart rate went to 160 and BP 210/140 and the cardiologist stopped the stress test.  Said my risk of heart disease is very low and started on beta blockers which help tremendously although not with the pain. \nSeptember 26, 2019\nDuring moving, I woke up one day with severe lower ribcage pain and tenderness. Hospital runs multiple tests and conclude it is a muscle sprain with no other explanation.  No excessive force or sudden movements - we had movers and I wasnt carrying anything. tests run on spleen, possible infarction, X-rays.  All negative.  \n6 weeks later... Now\nLower left under ribs still very sore. Can't sleep on this side due to pain.  Have been nauseous and have puked several times.  Feel like interstitial cystitis may be returning as I have bladder pain and discomfort. Right side seems to now be getting sore.  I don't feel like this is a strained muscle.  There's a possibility that this issue isn't related to the rest. \nFamily history: Lupus, thyroid disease, breast cancer, heart disease, sudden psychosis in father and grandfather when respectively in their 50s.  \nFull list of diagnoses: alopecia (no treatment), reiters syndrome (codeine prescription for pain), inflammatory arthritis (add celebrex and plaquenil), fibromyalgia, chronic anemia (iron supplements), low mineral levels (electrolyte salt sticks), ADHD (concerta), ASD (regular psychologist), PTSD (EMDR), hypotonia, multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome, migraine, visual snow, hole in retina from looking at an eclipse as a kid but vision in bad eye still 20/20 and good eye is at 20/10, post orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (propranolol), extreme light sensitivity (can't go outside without fl-41 tinted glasses, allergic asthma related to inhaled allergens (can no longer work in an office setting), severe anxiety and depression, borderline high blood pressure, vaso vagal pain response, dyshidrotic excema, tendonitis, bursitis, low sodium, potassium and magnesium levels, anemia even with iron supplements, high urea on multiple tests, low thyroid function\nFull prescription list:\nPlaquenil, concerta, duloxetine, tramadol XR, celebrex, ranitidine, singulair, breo, clonazepam for acute anxiety\nSupplements:\nMineral drops, magnesium, vit d / c / a / turmeric, salt sticks electrolyte replacement, zinc, B6, B12, msm, glucosamine, omega 3, probiotics\n\nI'm getting worse and worse.

So I'm a 27yo fit woman and I've had consistent low level pain and stiffness in my lower left back (around my tailbone) since adolescence. Kept it under control with lots of stretching, occasional trips to the chiropractor, and a steady flow of ibuprofen. Over the last year it's gotten noticeably worse and spread to my hip and groin area on the same side - that entire area has a pretty limited range of motion despite 2-3x daily stretching, and the pain level is pretty much always a 4 at the very least. This might sounds nutty, but it feels like my lower spine has fused together or something - it takes me hours of stretching to feel like things are even remotely cracked back into place, and when the pops finally happen they're accompanied by a loud series of crunches and a sensation of something breaking free. There's also a very strange jelly-like substance under the skin all around the painful area (just the left side) that I've never felt anywhere else in my body. In the last six months my pain level has progressed to closer to a 7 or 8 most days, and at least once a week when I get home from work (where I'm on my feet for 8-12 hours at a time) it's so bad all I can do is smoke a boat load of weed and lay in bed or massage different areas of concentrated pain with a tennis ball. Around the same time it got significantly worse, I noticed two lumps that I'm fairly certain are lymph nodes in my left groin area that are always somewhat swollen compared to the other side and are sometimes even rock hard. When I massage this area, it does seem to give me some relief but that's usually followed with a different kind of pain, like a throbbing ache, and I end up with a small amount of brown, super sticky vaginal discharge in the following hours. \n\nI brought my doctor up to speed on all of this and he sent me back to the chiropractor. Chiro doc told me my right leg is shorter than my left and now has me wearing a shoe insert. I guess it maybe is helping my lower back pain a tiny bit, but otherwise nothing has changed. My lower spine and hip are \\*constantly\\* cracking throughout the day, as well as my left knee and ankle. I also wake up between 5-15 times every night needing to crack something back in place to ease the pain or massage my groin or hip area to loosen things up. Some nights I can't sleep at all even when I'm utterly exhausted. My lymph nodes are still swollen and hard and my whole groin area seems to hurt more and more every week.\n\nI'm not sure if any of this is relevant, but a few more details:\n\n\\- around the same time the pain kicked up a notch and I noticed the groin lumps, I started experiencing brief spells where my heart beats extremely hard (not fast, just hard) for 5-15 seconds at a time\n\n\\- my left foot seems to have some major hyper-pronation going on and my toes are definitely not in proper alignment. The term I've found that best describes it is hammer toes, and I also have a pretty gnarly bunion that comes and goes\n\n\\- I've always been fit but have never had a very healthy diet - my sugar intake is through the roof and always has been, and I've had trouble getting doctors to believe how poor my diet is because I appear very healthy \n\n\\- I have no family or personal history of seizures but started having them out of the blue a couple years ago\n\nAt this point I'm in constant pain and I spend a lot of free time on the internet trying to figure out the cause. I've brought this up with both of my doctors multiple times but neither seems motivated to address the whole problem, they each just give me tiny fixes like \"get more sleep\" or \"keep stretching every day\" and send me on my way. My insurance doesn't cover much so I'm worried if I just start requesting tests, I'll end up with a pile of debt and no answers. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

I saw my doctor today (I\u2019ll admit I have a negative bias toward him as he has overlooked glaring issues in many family members that have led to their death). He squeezed the wrist, I told him when it hurt, and he said it won\u2019t be broken it\u2019s just a sprain. \n\nIm still very concerned about my wrist as it doesn\u2019t feel like just a sprain and the circulation and pain is worrying me. Do you think I should trust his judgement and see if it improves, or should I go to a minor injuries unit and ask for an x ray? \n\nThank you in advance for any help!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I\u2019m going to be getting a \u201csecond opinion\u201d from another neuro-immunology specialist as soon as I can, though playing the waiting game between doctors appointments can be agonizing.\n\n\nWhen I was 10 years old I was admitted to the hospital after having a constant fever for almost 2 weeks, and after doing some tests the doctors informed us I had contracted Typhus. I was inpatient for about a week (if I remember correctly), given antibiotics, and we figured all was well and done. A few months later is when I got my first UTI which was causing incontinence that my parents just assumed was a kid thing, something for attention; by the time I saw a urologist and we figured out what was happening the UTI had caused scarring on my kidneys. After this I couldn\u2019t go any longer than a month without having another UTI, and I also began to experience semi-frequent bowel incontinence. The urologist told us I had an underdeveloped bladder, making me prone to accidents. So I had to learn about Poise pads at age 11.\n\nShortly after 6th grade started my mom would occasionally make comments about my gait. She would ask, \u201cWhy do you walk like that? You jut out your hips in a weird way\u201d. I never made a conscious effort to walk a certain way, so I didn\u2019t think a lot about it. By 7th grade I was having a great deal of difficulty keeping my balance while walking, so I always held onto the wall. I found that it was nearly impossible to not drag my feet because my legs were so tired. My mom had brought this up during my routine PCP appointments, though nothing ever came of it.\n\nIt was the Halloween of 2014 when my parents snapped and decided that something was, surely, very wrong. After about 20 minutes of trick-or-treating, my legs gave out. I sat on the sidewalk and cried because I knew this wasn\u2019t normal, and my dad was equally as upset. My parents took me to the ER the next day and demanded that I see a doctor who would take my progressive symptoms seriously. I was admitted and in the hospital for three days so they could do \u201cevery test possible\u201d (some blood work, x-rays, and an MRI). We met my first neurologist who broke the news: they found nothing wrong with me, therefore, I must have conversion disorder. My parents were elated to find out nothing was PHYSICALLY wrong\u2014 meaning I could be cured\u2014 but I knew right away that something was very, very wrong. We left with a prescription for Prozac and a list of counselor recommendations.\n\nAll throughout 8th grade I continued getting worse, and nothing ever came of the follow up appointments I had with the neurologist. By this point I could not stand back up after falling on the floor, and I needed someone to hold me up as I walked. This neurologist convinced my entire family AND medical team that I was getting worse because I was faking everything, and trying to manipulate people for extra privileges. I was hospitalized in a behavioral institution 4 times due to suicidal ideation and self harm; nobody believed me, and I had to deal with my deterioration all on my own.\n\nAt age 14 I got a walker, and by age 15 I had to resort to a wheelchair. It wasn\u2019t until I was 16 that I went in for a routine optometrist appointment and the eye doctor, essentially, saved my life. She saw that there were white spots on each of my optic nerves, which tends to be seen in patients with MS, and she recommended us to an opthamologist who we saw 2 days later. They were baffled by the amount of swelling I had in my eyes, and said I was on the verge of losing my eyesight. This paired with my other neurological symptoms was very telling. The opthamologist told us to get out of town as soon as possible for a second opinion, so I was seen by a neurologist at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital in Houston.\n\nMy initial examination with the neurology team was enough to have me admitted. They did a full body MRI which revealed that I had swelling all throughout my brain and spine, presenting as scattered white specks. It was decided that whatever I have was an autoimmune response. After a process of elimination the doctors wanted to treat me for CLIPPERS. I did a 5 day round of steroids, 1000 ml intravenously each day. Then 1000 ml a week for 3 weeks, and finally 1000 ml a month for about 4 months. During this time I was also taking Cellcept orally. I went back for a follow up MRI and they swelling had gotten distinctively worse. We know that I don\u2019t have CLIPPERS because of the spine involvement (which is atypical) and the fact that I am not responsive to steroids. After that, we continued searching for a treatment to reduce the swelling. \n\n-I was on Cytoxan once a month for 4 months, while also getting IVIG once a week.\n\n-The swelling was still progressing, so we did plasmapheresis followed by 2 doses of Rituximab. \n\n-Again, the swelling was worse. So they did a brain biopsy to get more insight, and all we were told was that there was an excessive amount of T-cells (which supposedly CONFIRMS clippers, somehow? The neurologist will not let go of CLIPPERS and insists this must be the problem). They decided to have me do yet another 5 day round of steroids, 1000 ml a day, and that showed no improvement. \n\n-Next I was on Tocilizumab for 5 months which caused a severe outbreak of psoriasis all over my body, while the swelling continued to get worse. I began taking Otezla for the psoriasis and wondered if, maybe, that would do something for the swelling (it didn\u2019t). \n\n-The current treatment we\u2019re trying out is Gilenya; I had my first dose on 8/23. \n\nAt this point I\u2019ve given up on being hopeful, and living like this for so long without having a proper diagnosis is exhausting. I need to know what\u2019s wrong with me so I can finally accept it and cope with everything. I need someone to help me, to listen and take me seriously. I\u2019ve fought for so long and I\u2019m beginning to just give up. \n\nI am in a wheelchair full time; I\u2019m not strong enough to stand or walk, but I can move and feel my legs a little bit. I wear pull-ups all day and night in case of incontinence and I need to self-cath because my bladder will not fully empty anymore.

[Here is the original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/dq58ux/continual_cough_for_almost_3_months_and_daily/) I'm still coughing up similar looking phlegm. It's basically clear with a small tinge of yellow, appearance is very similar to [this](https://external-preview.redd.it/bDlEapB8pmy566V8aJ6in1yPmzyVw2giETt5t76TH74.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd67364cc48fdef2df2c3f1c6e6956baeb3ce69b) and as my previous post.\n\nAs I posted from my previous post, I did an x ray and a spirometry. X ray seems ok for now according to when I called the assistant of my family doctor, just got word that spirometry results are in so I'm going in on Friday, but the assistant didn't tell me much else about the results other than \"it's here\".\n\nSymptoms are more or less the same as before, the phlegm strands are a little longer some days and some times a little thicker. I can also huff these guys out if I do some deep exhaling occasionally, but this normally happens a few minutes after I cough or exhale really hard with nothing coming out.\n\nThe majority of my cough feels dry and because I've been coughing my airways feel cold when I breath, and it's almost a bit sore. My lymph nodes are a little swollen these last two days but I've been staying up pretty late doing homework so it could be the fatigue. Yesterday I went out for a while, and at first my chest would like rumble/vibrate if I didn't try to clear my chest occasionally. It went away after about 30-40 minutes because I only noticed it when I was on the bus.\n\nI've been drinking Chinese medicine under the orders of my mother who thinks antibiotics are doing jack all. The first week it felt like it worked, one of the days the plugging feeling in my chest even went away and I thought I was getting better. This week they switched up my herbs though and I also went to a friends birthday where I was talking and laughing a lot, and I'm coughing more, not more than before I started the first round of medicine but basically back to where I was before I started feeling better.\n\nBasically if I start coughing or doing some deep huffs, I'll feel like I want to cough more. If I ignore the plugged feeling though it's controllable. But a few times in the last couple of days if I don't cough and I inhale deep/long I'll have a slight shortness of breath. It doesn't happen when I breath normally though. It feels more like something is itching my airway which causes the shortness almost.\n\nI took a mucinex yesterday to see if it'll relieve the chest feeling, but it didn't do anything, didn't cough up extra phlegm, didn't thin anything out, at least not seemingly. I have a physicians sample symbicort, I only took it once or twice but it doesn't feel like it changes much. I guess I do cough a little less but at the end of the day I still feel like there's something in the middle of my chest.\n\nI'm going in on Friday to see the family doctor and get the results and see what she thinks. If we still can't figure it out I'm thinking of asking for more antibiotics and maybe oral/inhaled steroids because we haven't tried that yet. Because my x ray is fine I don't think it'll warrant a bronchoscopy but I'm starting to feel like that's a good idea. I'll probably save one of those strands of mucus next one I cough one up before the appointment and ask for a culture since I'm pretty goddamn annoyed and done with this cough.\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions on what kind of diagnosis I might have please tell me, I'm going to basically just give my family doctor a list of everything that sounds plausible and see where we move on from there.\n\nPretty sure it's not the onset of anything, possible minor infection that never really went away because of the small specs of yellow mucus but I don't have fevers, no chills unless I skipped some meals or is low on sugar (when I'm doing homework I tend to eat just one meal), no fatigue, no shortness of breath on normal occasions, I can walk around for pretty long no problem, don't think exercise will do anything but I've been refraining. The couple of times I did some at home workouts I didn't wheeze, didn't have shortness of breath but that was a few weeks back while I was still on antibiotics. Only thing different is these two days my lymph nodes along my neck/base of skull-ear area seem a little swollen. Not visibly large but I can feel like small bumps and some soreness when I press it. Another area that's sore is like the base of the inside of my throat on the right side if I breath in deep and hold my breath in prep for a deep exhale or a deep cough. Pretty sure the throat is just from coughing too much, since it feels a little better today compared to yesterday, but not sure about the lymph nodes.\n\nThanks in advance!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I'm diagnosed with anxiety and I've had ongoing tendinitis and bursitis on my left shoulder (rotator cuff) for 3 years. \n\nSo about a year ago (last November) I developed a sudden onset on myoclonus. My limbs jerked frantically (there was jerking at least every 20 seconds, 24/7, for 3 months straight). My hand would open and close by itself, my abdominal muscles would jerk my body one direction while my upper back muscles would tighten forcefully, only to release after 20 seconds or so while I gasped for air. Sometimes my throat muscles would twitch (I thought I would choke to death), my blood pressure would drop, I would get hot flashes, burning sensations, and pins &amp; needles all over my body.  I would feel myself go faint (but never did faint). \n\nI've been to the ER I believe 3 times over the last year. They would run tests, everything would come back normal, and they would dismiss my symptoms and tell me to go home. I consulted a neurologist, they've run test but the only thing they found \"wrong\" with me, was low ferratin levels so they prescribed me ferratin supplements and sent me on my way last December.  My neurologist did mention that my MRI showed some very small lesions on my spinal cord that could be caused by 3 years of chronic inflammation of my bad shoulder (I'm going to an orthopedic and physical therapist for this issue). However, it seems that they were so insignificant that he didn't even note them on my chart because my primary care provider said he didn't even mention them...\n\nThe symptoms lessened in February of this year, but I still have ongoing myoclonus (My muscles jerk about 20-30 times a day now and my hand doesn't open and close often, still get abdominal muscle jerking and shoulder tightness). I still get occasional hot flashes/ burning sensations, and frequent pins &amp; needles. \n\nIn July of this year,  I had sudden right calf pain and tightness while lying down, my heart sped up suddenly although I was calm moments prior due to the pain (I was lying down in bed) I felt faint as if my blood pressure went down, my limbs felt a tingling sensation and the left side of my face went numb. The episode lasted about 10 minutes. As the days went on I've developed a constant numb, and tingling sensation from my right knee to right toe. Went to the doctor, got dismissed, and to this day some nerve in my right toe feels weird and sensitive to the touch. I've gone on to develop stiffness in my arms, legs, and fingers.  Sometimes my right leg drags behind me. Got blood work done for arthritis and autoimmune diseases in September, and tested negative. \n\nToday, I was on public transport on the way home from work and my left arm, my jaw, tongue, and cheeks went numb. I was sitting straight and relaxed. The episode lasted about 10 minutes. I cried out of frustration of never having any answers. My doctors have all dismissed me, because I got diagnosed with anxiety when I was 18. It was situational, I'm 26 now. \n\nAnyways, any suggestions on what I should be testing for next?

I was given an MRI as a child, but they didn't find anything, and I've been able to move around perfectly well throughout my life. This is combined with some other minor issues:\n\n* I learned to crawl late, and when I did crawl, it was with one leg in the air\n* My feet would frequently fall asleep. This is the issue that I was given the MRI for. As I said, they didn't find anything, but my mom says that when I woke up and started walking around, one side of my body was dragging. \n*  It took me a really long time to learn to climb up or down ladders or stairs. I had to be taken to occupational therapy for this, as well as some other general coordination issues. In fact, I still go down stairs slower than average, and usually have to look down at my feet while doing so.              \n* I walked on my toes frequently as a child, and thus shortened my hamstrings. I had to wear leg braces at night for about a year in childhood for this, and stretching them in any way beyond normal movement causes burning pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n* My parents insist that I walk funny, in a sort of \"bouncing\" motion.

I told him I was surprised to hear this and he was wondering why I'd want to find something. I said it's because I feel like I'd rather something show up and know what the issue is than to have nothing show up and deal with the symptoms. In the end I had more blood work/urine done and was prescribed Lexapro. \nThe thing is, I want a second opinion, because I truly believe something is wrong with me. I wouldn't call myself a depressed or anxious person (the anxiety started after the symptoms formed). \nMy main symptoms right now are muscle twitching, tremors, vertigo, occasionally lightheaded/feeling faint, feeling like I can't breathe (I have to take deep breaths often). These symptoms give me bouts of anxiety which lead to them getting worse and adding on derealization/depersonalization. I'm unable to sleep at night anymore without falling asleep to TV. All of this started right after taking Ivermectin. No doctors think that's related to my symptoms, even my neurologist. \nCould I be a hypochondriac, or should I get more tests (EEG, spinal tap)?

Is located behind the ear before you reach the neck. It's hard to describe the area I don't know if it has a name or not. This pain started about February when I was 17 so that's 2014. I first will come and go like headaches but I really took notice because it would always happen in the same exact spot. The headaches would always happen whenever I was trying to focus on reading especially in class. Fast forward to a year later I'm in college second semester these headaches don't go away it's a constant pain in the back of my head day and night. It's not like it's a harsh pain it's just a small pain but very noticeable. During that semester I used adderal to help me in my English course. I took the adderal I got my work done my next class was trigonometry and I started taking my notes and I just kind of got stunned because my notes look exactly how they did in high school before the pain started I had and I realized how sloppy and terrible my notes were. I even took my notes and compared them at home to my notes from the previous year. At the moment it became clear that this pain was affecting me mentally, I got really scared. I thought I had tumor. I told my mom about it, she didn't believe me. I ended up seeing a specialist, which I don't think she believed me either. Her main concern was putting me on antidepressants, it's like this head pain was no concern to get, she eventually ordered a CT with and without contrast. So I went to the place and they said my insurance covered but there upfront cost was $2000. They wouldn't even let me be billed. So I went to the ER on Halloween 2015. I was there for about 6 hours. I only got the regular CT, I forgot about the contrast. So the doctor comes in and says \" The machine detected no abnormalities. You can go home.\" Then walked off. That was 4 years ago I still have this pain. I honestly think that hospital thinks I'm looking for drugs anytime I go there. ( Acetaminophen and ibuprofen allergy). The pain reliever I can take is naproxen, but it doesn't help at all. this pain gets in the way of a lot of things Reading writing I can say in confidence I am less smarter than I was in high school my college career has tanked because of this. It's like anytime I try to focus this like this pain turns its own volume up and becomes the only thing that I can focus on. It's like trying to talk to someone when someone's yelling in your ear and you're only person that can hear them. It only gets that bad when I'm actually trying to be productive while reading writing I'm pretty good at math but recently that's been taking longer for me. It even affects my short term memory. Things that don't really require that much brain power running exercising driving I can do without hassle but when it comes to it things I actually had to really focus on it becomes near impossible. Even writing this is taking me near three hours now. I'm just hoping someone out there might have an answer I've been thinking that it might be like an air bubble trapped behind where you pop your neck at top of your skull so anything I can really think of because the closest thing to that spot is where you pop your neck at, even doing that I don't feel any relief.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I went to see a doctor who recommended getting an ultrasound of my neck. The ultrasound showed that there are multiple lymph nodes swollen and an FNAC test is suggested. A couple of days later I got the first FNAC test done but it was a bad sample since there was too much blood in it, so then they did another FNAC, this time they took a sample from 2 nodes in my neck and one from my underarm ( lymph nodes are swollen all over my body). I got started on antibiotics- *Amoxycillin and potassium Clavulanate 500 mg+125 mg along with paracetamol for a week.* It didn't help at all\n\nif anything I've gotten worse since then. A blood test showed that my body's WBC count was 15% higher. And the FNAC test stated - *Smears from right and left cervical and right axillary lymph nodes are highly cellular showing plymorphous population of lymphoid cells comprising of centrocytes, centroblasts, scattered immunoblasts mature lymphocytes, plasma cells and scattered tingible body macrophages. Large lympho- histiocytic clusters and many scattered histiocytes are also seen with features of hemophagocytosis.*\n\nNo granuloma or atypical cells noted.\n\nImpression - features are of reactive lymph nodes.\n\nThe doctor ruled out tuberculosis and cancer. I took this report and went to another doctor who started got me started on another course of antibiotics namely Ceftum 500mg, celin 500mg and Allegra 120 mg. I have constant headaches and body pains so I have to eat 2-3 paracetamols per day. I also got tonsillitis 3 days back so its very hard to eat or drink anything.\n\nIt may be important to note that just 2 weeks before this started I was down with really bad food poisoning/ Gastritis for about 4-5 days .

I started noticing I would start throwing up after drinking ( something i used to never do ) but I just ignored it as I figured thats pretty normal. Fast forward to about a month and half ago I came home drunk and threw up brown ( like coffee grounds ) color in my sink and that night had horrible excruciating abdominal pain right below my belly button that affects that whole area. Since then several blood tests and stool and urine tests and ct scan later they all came back negative however in ct scan showed bowel inflammation. i saw a GI and was worried i had chrons or Ulcerative colitis since i had diahrea too ( no blood though) . they did a colonscopy and said inflammation in bowel is gone and was probably due to infection. my diahrea went away but now still a month and a half later im dying from severe abdominal pain. i take pantoprazole twice a day as i also have bad nausea daily. these are my two main symptoms : chronic abdominal pain that will become lesser or more in severity but i can always feel it throughout the day and chronic nausea. i wanted to try antibiotics but they prescribed me Elavil as they say it is a nerve pain medication and thats what they think I am dealing with. I picked up the Elavil but havent touched it since i used to take Zoloft and it made me put on a lot of weight which I do not want, and do not want to permanently change the way my metabolism works.

I have hemorrhoids and as I've been going more often, I've had some blood.  It's normal bright red, and I'm fairly certain that it's from the hemorrhoids as I can feel pain where I assume the skin has split - it is not mixed in with stool.  I've been to see my doctor about this, and she's recommended me for a colonoscopy - She didn't really say what's up with that, but after reading and my symptoms I'm guessing she's suspecting either crohn's disease or colon cancer.

I need help", "author": "Deegurz", "self_text": "I'm not really sure where to begin with my illness or its causes, so I'm going to give a lot of background. I'm sorry if not all of it is relevant.\n\nI am a 27 year old male. When I was 20, I was quite underweight due to chronic exercise and undereating (I didn't know it was an ED at the time. short version is it started as a way for me to rid myself of gynecomastia I had throughout my teen years). I felt healthy and happy at the time, but one day I acquired a foodborne illness from an unwashed piece of fruit I ate, and it lead to a rapid spiraling of health consequences. I checked myself into the hospital at around 95lbs (was 110-115 previously) Basically, all of my organs were put in jeopardy. My liver was on the verge of failing, I experienced severe rhabdomyolysis, my kidneys were in trouble, etc. After a week's stay in the hospital on fluids and steady nutrition, my bloodwork was starting to look good and I was discharged. \n\nUnfortunately, returning to my normal life while also trying to gain weight turned out to be a costly mistake. Despite my best efforts, I ended up losing more weight (down to 82lbs), and my rhabdo had seemingly returned. Feeling very down about my situation and wanting a motivation to eat the copious amount of food required of me, when I was offered marijuana by a family member I accepted. I immediately regretted this, as soon as I took a hit I reacted violently. My heartrate rose dramatically, and I remember feeling like I was about to die. I tried to stand and stumbled, hurried to my room and laid down. What happened next has been imprinted into my memory, as it was the moment I believe I \\*felt\\* myself break. It was like my brain was moving faster and faster, and then suddenly it felt like something snapped, and everything slowed down. A lot. In the moment I felt immense despair, as I somehow knew I had caused irrevocable damage. I know marijuana is generally regarded as safe (my thought going into it) and I still believe it probably is, but that experience was unlike any I've ever had with the drug (was an occasional, but experienced user before that). I chalked this up to being a \"bad trip\" the next morning, but even though I tried very hard to pretend like everything was fine, something felt different. I was more forgetful than usual, my thinking and speech were slowed. I began despairing over my situation, and a few days later, after increased weight loss, I ended up having a seizure and was hospitalized. This time I stayed in the hospital for 2 weeks. The entire time I pleaded with the doctors that something else was wrong (I believed serotonin syndrome at the time), but they ran many tests and assured me that I was fine. All my labs were normalizing, as they had been. I was released again, this time into an eating disorder clinic, and while my weight gain continued, the forgetfulness and \"slow\" feeling did not abate. As painful as it is to admit, I don't think it ever really went away, but I learned to accept it. I am thankful for my family for supporting me this entire time. \n\nAfter gaining a \"healthy\" amount of weight (around 40lbs), I decided I wanted to try strength training. Despite following a pretty good diet (adequate calories and protein) and consistent training, I saw little effect. I did this for about two years with no measurable growth (yet still gaining weight), before stopping entirely.  What I did notice, however, was that my calves had begun to twitch. I monitored this for awhile, and after consulting with a neurologist, concluded it was benign fasciculations. The twitches expanded past my calves however, and everywhere they went, I seemed to lose muscle mass. I don't know if it followed a specific order as it would come and go all over, but I first noticed it in my calves. And then my hands and forearms. Feet. Thighs. Chest. Upper arms and legs. Neck. And, most recently (and perhaps most devastating), my pelvic floor muscles and face. While I can still control my muscles in all these areas and \"use them\", they have all become noticeably smaller and weaker. With the most recent effects on my face, I \\*look\\* different. I practically have no eyelids, and my cheeks have sunken in greatly. It's been very difficult to come to grips with, let alone hide. I should mention that I have not lost weight in quite awhile, to ensure that's not a factor. I am 6'1\" and up to 145lbs, with a decent amount of bodyfat  (I know how that sounds, but I have a very slight frame and virtually no muscle bulk).\n\nEven more recently I have been feeling chest pains. It is just occasional twinges, but there is a constant feeling of constriction / light pressure. My BP is normal, but my pulse is constantly on the higher side. This has terrified me, especially since my father died of a heart attack just a year and a half ago. I am unsure of whether to tell my family. I don't want to worry them,  but I don't want to leave them in the dark either, in case something happens. I emailed my doctor the other day about it, and they emailed me back requesting a phone call (I will do so in the morning).\n\nToday I saw my neurologist again, and she performed nerve and muscle tests on my limbs. The short version of that is my nerves  all seem to be healthy and intact, with my muscles responding to them (good news?). She believes, however, that something may be \"irritating\" the nerve, causing widespread muscle atrophy. She said it is likely a \"systemic problem with your body, after trying to bounce back from your death scare\". \n\nI basically have no idea what this could be, as all the research I'd done before was into neurological conditions (which still seems plausible). I've talked to my primary extensively about this as well, but he seems just as lost as I do. This has greatly impacted how I live my life, and I am becoming desperate. Even just knowing would help.\n\nThanks for reading. I'm sorry for the length, hopefully someone's willing to go through it all and lend some advice. If you'd like pictures or have any follow up questions, feel free to leave a reply.\n\nTL DR;  Muscle atrophying over the course of years, chest pains, and possible brain fog after a traumatic incident.

She has had issues with severe throat pain at times where it affects her esophagus and sometimes progresses down to her stomach. The sensation she has is the same as the one you feel when you get that lump in your throat just before crying or after being hurt emotionally. Now imagine having that feeling all the time. She also says that she feels tightness in her chest sometimes. She recently developed nasal congestion and pressure in her ears similar to the feeling of when you are in a plane at high altitudes. The symptoms of the nose and ears though comes and goes and also includes a runny nose. When she swallows food the lump in her throat doesn't hurt but when she swallows saliva it hurts.\n\nShe has been to 3 different otolaryngologists and none of them have found anything wrong with her. Some of the tests they did include several blood tests, ultra sound scans and x-rays, checked her esophagus with a camera several times and found nothing. She does have a hiatal hernia but I'm not sure if that would contribute to her symptoms since she doesn't really have that much problems with acid reflux atleast from what she is telling me, no heartburn symptoms either. The common consensus from the doctors is the hiatal hernia and GERD but if she isn't having the feeling of heartburn could it still be stomach acid that causes all this? She was also taken to the hospitals heart unit after she had episodes of high blood pressure and they checked her heart and also did some blood tests, it happened 3 times and everything was fine, it seems like when the pain got really bad my mom had a panic attack of some kind each time. Last week she got a gastrocopy and was found with some bacteria in her stomach called Helicobakter Pylori and got some medication for it but her symptoms have worsened. During the gastrocopy she said the lump in her throat became very uncomfortable and painful for her when the equipment was being inserted in the esophagus, but I'm guessing that's normal for that type of procedure? So far I'm lost as to what I can do to help my mother, the doctors in Denmark don't seem to know what is wrong and even if I wanted to take her to a private hospital or to another country to seek better medical care, financially I am unable to do so since I am still a student and my mother is unable to work. All I am hoping for is to get another POV and any advice or some insight would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThe medication that she has been taking so far is as follows:\n\nPantoprazol 40mg 1 tablet twice a day (present medication)\n\nDolol 100mg - she has taken this when she had chronic back pain, she stopped since she got better from physical therapy.\n\nDiprofos - took it once a month, 2 times.\n\nBudecort (Budesonide)\n\nLara (Loratadine)\n\nLicoften (Ketotifen 1mg)\n\nAvamys (nasal spray)\n\nGaviscon (present medication)\n\nImadrax (amoxicillin) 1000mg (present medication) - started a week ago after gastrocopy\n\nClarithromycin (clarithromycin) 500mg (present medication) - started a week ago after gastrocopy", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I am pretty much desperate, as my doctors' appointment is in two weeks only, and the situation seems to be worsening. I just would like to have a spectrum of possibilities as to why I am feeling what I am feeling.\n\nFor some months (almost one year), I've had lower right abdominal pain which I can't exactly say it feels it's more on the back or on the front of the body - it's feels like deep inside. Along with it, I've pissed some blood for a couple of days throughout the 1-year time period. Also, and I don't know if that is related or not, I've felt both legs numbed (but only in the front, lower part of the legs - the opposite to the calves). It's not a paralyzing numbness - it just feels like I lose a little feeling on the skin, and the numbness is uncomfortable enough to mention.  \n\n\nI've had exams to check if there was any sign of infections - zilch, nada. My urine and blood tests came out okay (months ago, though). Then I had an ultrasound of my abdomen, looking for possible kidney stones. No luck, either. Clean as can be. Then I had an electroneuromiography to check the nerves in my legs - 100% fine, too.  \n\n\nThe pain feels like pulsating - as if I had to pass gas or use the toilet. It's constant, and may get more intense depending on the position I sit and specially when I ejaculate - that makes it feel like a stabbing, 1 or 2 second pain in my lower right abdomen. Also, my testicles may be a bit too sensitive to the touch - revealing some sort of pain - and the right testicle is higher than the left one - which seems to have changed through this 1-year time period, too.  \n\n\nShould I go to a hospital or wait for the doctor's appointment in two weeks (urologist. I also have a colonoscopy scheduled for the same week of the appointment)? The pain has worsened since last week, when I had intercourse, and it is making me feel really worried that there's something that may be getting worse by the hour.\n\nYesterday, I was really scared because it hurt to even breathe. I had some ibuprofen and the pain subsided, but I don't want to be taking it for all the next days until the appointment.  \n\n\nAny ideas or recommendations?

Moderate, lifelong chronic depression and ADHD (which makes activity problematic) and  moderately high blood pressure only known issues. I take 25 mgs. of hydrochlorothiazide (BP med) every night. And I take a small dose of Armor thyroid which I get from India (more on that below). I know my blood sugar is very good and normal.\n\nHave had the below problem for about 20 years ( but even as a child I often had chronic fatigue) but it seems to be progressing surely but slowly. The symptoms seem to come and go and some days I seem to get a tantalizing and inexplicable reprieve and taste what more or less normal feels like.\n\nSymptoms:\n\nWhole body gets achy and stiff anytime I remain inactive for a significant period. No particular joint pain or swelling - problem seems more in whole body than limited to joint areas. ( I have lost some range of motion and cannot rule out joint issues though, but I am 64) Symptoms go away, more or less, after I force myself to face the pain and get up and do something to get moving again but even then activity and motion are somewhat forced and less than pleasant and I start to long for a comfy chair before too long and then I sink into a motionless, sluggish state in front of the TV. The pain of movement is not terribly bad but it's everywhere and thus enough to seriously discourage forced movement. While sitting still the pain goes away but when I get up or turn over in bed it sings out pretty good.\n\nMy job is actually very active - constant physical labor and motion - climbing  and carrying ladders, working with my hands, and I do this 4 to 5 days a week for about 5 hours continuously. I also play about 6 hours of tennis every weekend. During work and tennis I feel okish with the symptoms (even rather energetic and powerful in tennis. I don't act or appear geriatric or sickly at all) but after 4 to 6 hours of work I am moderately exhausted and need to sit and nap and thus return to my above state of stiff and sluggish in the chair, mostly surfing and playing video games..\n\nAbout ten years ago I had extreme fatigue after even a couple hours at work or tennis and by the time I finished I was dragging my corpse around until I could come home and crash in bed. I felt downright anemic, as if every cell in my body was depleted. Eating and sleeping were the only things that helped at all but neither helped very much. ( My blood sugar is very normal and eating never affected this much at all) Only laying in bed for two three hours returned my energy to close to normal. Out of desperation I ordered Armor thyroid from India and soon after starting it the horribly extreme aspect of the fatigue went away and has never come back.\n\nI have not been to a doctor about this because 1. I was poor and 2. I was afraid to face my issues (yes, stupid I know) Now I have insurance and plenty of money and I suppose I need to see a doctor.\n\nAny ideas? BTW Taking extra thyroid medication does not seem to affect any extra improvement. I wonder if that was a red herring/placebo  all along but I am afraid to stop taking it because that problem it fixed was so miserable. Only med which seems to maybe address the issue is Ibuprofen, although Kratom seemed to work wonders for a while but I developed a significant dependency and had to taper off of it. Now I fear going back on it for fear of becoming physically dependent.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

A challenge to gulp water down the throat, she described it as when she tried to swallow water, all of her chest and nose muscle become tense so she had to suck in the water with more force causing headaches, temple (tempora) muscle tensed, jaw muscle tensed, or having to spill out her saliva (best case scenario) to be able to drink.\n\n3.)

The problem he's having is that he feels like he has to pee all the time. That's IT. It started mid-August after we'd hung out and I'd given him oral sex. He took cipro as soon as the symptom (feeling the urge to pee constantly) became apparent, as this had happened once before but had gone away with UTI treatment, but it didn't do anything. As of now, he has gotten tested for STIs several times (all negative), and his doctors have ruled out both UTI infections and kidney stones. The closest thing he has gotten to a diagnosis is prostatitis, but the medication they have given based on that hasn't done anything. The ONLY symptom he has had this whole time has been feeling like he needs to pee. Not necessarily /needing/ to pee, just FEELING like he needs to. I don't know if it's relevant, but I myself have had no symptoms of anything, and I am the only partner he's had in several years.

I was carrying a heavy bag over my right shoulder for a prolonged period of time when I was in line at the airport. This was back in 2014. Right away I noticed weird sensations in my right hand and around my right clavicle area going into the shoulder. I then noticed some buzzing going into my right shoulder tricep area. I ignored it, stayed active and it only got worse. I then started experiencing stinging pain in my right pec minor and my right shoulder. Every time I overstretched my right arm such as doing pull-ups or any type of chest work, or just stretching out the right arm in general caused all of these sensations the next day. It wasn't a normal soreness sensation. Saw a doctor who prescribed me gabapentin, which did nothing. Finally I try to Lyrica, and it was the only thing that masked the pain and got me active again. I deduced from this that it was a nerve issue, most likely an overstretched brachial plexus because I had all the symptoms. This was definitely nerve pain, and not muscular physical. I have had muscular physical issues in my left arm that required surgery so I know what that pain feels like. The pain would also be enhanced during orgasm, when I could feel weird nerve sensations go into my right arm. How does this even work? Would it be due to all the contractions and spasms during orgasm? This has really affected my sex life, every time I orgasm I feel like my nerve pain is enhanced.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually the nerve pain spread down to my right elbow and masked the symptoms of tennis elbow. Doctors were flabbergasted, not sure what was going on. I had to increase my Lyrica dose which helped some more, but it was definitely masking a lot of pain. I tried a C7 epidural thinking that possibly this issue was coming from the neck, but that did nothing but introduce some chronic migraines and headaches I still deal with as a result of that decision to do that. I tried everything to find a solution including all the and anti-inflammatories, injections, everything you can think of. The only thing that helped my right arm was a lidocaine ketamine 45 minute infusion which made my right arm feel like it was normal again. Like I could actually feel as if my arm felt new. Of course, once the infusion was over the pain came back. This at least gave me peace of mind knowing that my issue wasn't psychological, and that there was obviously something structurally wrong. Ever since 2014, I wake up every morning feeling like there's something trapped in my right shoulder girdle into the right pec area and into the shoulder that's causing all of these issues. I tried nerve tests, thoracic outlet MRI, the arterial blood flow test, brachial plexus MRI (without contrast though), right shoulder MRI, neck cervical MRI. Nothing seems to be able to pick up what is structurally going on which is so damn frustrating. I met a doctor in the states who tried to diagnose me with having chronic regional pain syndrome, but then a chronic pain doctor debunked that immediately and he told me that this was a chronic case of an overstretched brachial plexus that just may take quite a while to heal. I got desperate and tried kratom, which was the only thing that gave me sensation back in my right arm and made it feel normal. The pain actually went away, better than any painkiller. The stuff pretty much saved my life for the most part as I try to get through my PhD, but I still can't type with my right arm, pick up heavy things or anything. But at least kratom has made me somewhat functional. Tried medical MJ and American CBD oil, didn't really help me. Now I'm at a point where I have some breakthrough nerve pain again in my right arm and my physician is trying to send me back for another MRI of my shoulder.. Which obviously won't help considering I know this to be a brachial plexus issue which is referring the pain down my arm. What can possibly be done at this point? I'm still relatively young and this is truly debilitating. Do I go see a brachial plexus specialist, and hope that they can figure out something? Do I need a nerve ablation? I mean to do these kinds of serious procedures you have to have structural evidence. As someone who is considered a scholar and about to get my PhD, I've read enough research articles about strange medical cases and how long it can take to find a solution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSurely someone in the world has experienced something along the lines of what I'm going through and might have some recommendations? Let me emphasize that I do not have fibromyalgia or chronic regional pain syndrome, as this pain is only in this part of my body. I'm still relatively active and would be fully active if this one issue was figured out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also apologize if this is not very coherent, using voice to text technology given I can't use my right arm to type.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Doctors continually refer to it as \"palpitations\" but I keep explaining it doesn't feel like what I think would be palpitations. **It feels like the heart can't do its job**, like it cant pump or like its reached its max point, or braking point. It **feels like its being  constricted or strangled or squeezed**...so then it feels like it cant do its job. Or it cant pump? It feels urgent and scary like the heart will burst or die from reaching its breaking point.\n\nI saw a good Cardiologist over a year ago. This was after visiting my primary care doc, he told me to leave his office immediately and go to this Cardiologist. This cardiologist (after a few visits and tests) said my heart is good. The Cardiologist said he finds no problems.\n\nI met a nurse recently and in passing I described my heart issue and she said maybe its hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. She said she went undiagnosed for many years herself, everyone told her she had no noticable heart issues to be found. But because she was around doctors often, one finally told her it must be hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and it was. The description I find online fits my symptoms.\n\nSo, **MY QUESTION...** if I've done an echocardiogram test, would they have noticed \"hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\" or possibly missed it?

I'm 27, white female, USA.\n\nFirst I'll list the substances in my system at the time of the first incident and med history, then my symptoms, then the relevant background info leading up to the first incident... \n\nMeds in system at time of attack: Expired 50?mg Trazodone &amp; 100?mg Gabapentin leftover from a detox stint in 2015 + low dose of Kratom for heroin withdrawal + 20mg Prozac &amp; 150mg Wellbutrin (both of which I had just started taking again the day prior after 3 months of being off of it) + whatever minor amount of heroin and fentanyl that were leaving my system at the time\n---------------------------\n\nPrior Med history: Have been on Prozac, Wellbutrin, and Adderall for a decade, it's the only med combo that stabilizes me and keeps me clean, and have NEVER had an issue. \n+Dx history: depression, ADHD, substance use disorder.\n----------------------------------\n\nRelevant background info leading up to attack: So basically I got taken off my regular meds due to losing my insurance. I had been clean from IV heroin addiction for 4 years thanks to those meds but, as always, once they were out of my system I relapsed for 3 months. \n\nI told my parents I needed their help, so they had me come to their house to detox. I found some recent leftover Prozac and Wellbutrin of mine at their house so I decided to start taking them again that day-- fully anticipating to be put back on my meds after seeing a doctor in the upcoming days, so I wanted a head start getting back on my regime so I could stabilize ASAP. \n\nI also brought some Kratom to help with the withdrawal which I had no prior reactions to, and had even taken it on my regular med combo in the past. I took it around 10pm before bed, and then found some leftover detox meds from a prior rehab stint back in 2014- Trazodone and Gabapentin. I took one of each (less than originally prescribed), because I was scared of potential bad reactions if they were expired. Dumb, I know. Then fell asleep.\n----------------------------------\n\nSYMPTOMS:\nI woke up from sleep around 3am with:\n* a gnawing pain in my stomach, similar to diarrhea but worse. \n*Agitation\n*Restlessness\n*Anxiety. \n\nSo I tried to use the bathroom, but all that came out was a ton of mucous which has never happened before. \n\nWhile sitting on the toilet the symptoms progressed to:\n*Partial arm numbness\n*Pins and needles everywhere, mild though\n*Leg bouncing by itself \n*Hearing going in and out\n*Light sensitivity or lightheadedness, almost as if in a dream, colors even looked weird\n*Sudden desire to take my clothes off, they suddenly irritated my skin too much, even just sitting there\n*Sweating\n*Muscles were very tense \n*Increased heart rate, increased anxiety &amp; agitation.\n\nPain got worse, in waves, til the pain was so severe I thought about calling 911 but I couldn't fathom surviving the ambulance ride to the hospital, that's how bad the pain was. I was sure I was dying.\n\nThen, the peak of it:\n*My brain quickly started to feel like it was on fire, red hot, painful even. I wondered if my brain was swelling and if that is what would kill me.\n*Sweating became worse, noticed my skin was bright red\n*Felt very overheated \n*Chest discomfort, like a crushing sinking heartbreak/betrayal feeling in my chest, that's the only way I can describe it. \n*Blood pressure increased, all prior symptoms increased\n\nI don't know if it was instinct or what but suddenly I needed to feel the sensation of cold water so I turned the faucet on next to me and let the cold water rush over my hand, and it helped. Symptoms stopped increasing, the agitation and anxiety decreased.\n\nAfter about 2 minutes of letting all my other symptoms decrease besides the stomach cramps, I was finally able to use the bathroom. \n\n*Not to be graphic but the amount was unlike anything I had ever seen, yeah it was diarrhea, but it filled the entire toilet bowl to where there was a pile of it sticking above the water like an iceberg. I felt 20lb lighter honestly.\n\nBy then it was maybe 4am. After that I was normal again. A little exhausted but no weird symptoms so I went back to bed after telling myself it had to have just been a panic attack, despite knowing there's no way it was.\n----------------------------------\nEdit: and to clarify, this was not withdrawal symptoms, I had zero withdrawal symptoms thanks to the kratom, so I know the detox isn't what those symptoms came from. \n\n**Notes on current situation with the current milder attacks since then:\nI'm clean again, back on my Prozax, Wellbutrin, and Adderall combo, but still I've had a couple milder incidents since then, but it's just the cramps and agitation/restlessness/anxiety. \nSo now when it happens I instantly go to the toilet and run my hand under cold water while waiting for the diarrhea episode to pass. It stops the attack from progressing and it ends in about 20 minutes now. \nSerotonin syndrome fits the first episode but doesn't explain the milder ones so idk. \n\nAny guesses welcome, I'll be going to a specialist when my insurance kicks in in January to get checked out.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I'm a 28 year old male in the United States 6'3, really-*really*\\-white, 190 lbs. Six months ago, I changed cities, jobs, and many of my habits, which I thought was largely for the better. But now I'm just exhausted as soon as I get home, and have been sleeping for twelve to eleven hours at a stretch. \n\nI used to be a defense attorney at a seriously keyed up firm in the mid-Atlantic. I loved the work, it was challenging, rewarding, paid very, very well, but I could tell it was unsustainable. Sixty to seventy-five hour work weeks were the norm, and there was a lot of travelling from jails to courthouses all over my state. Additionally, we were on call with the partners and clients, more or less at all hours of the day, including weekends. During this time I would usually be up by six thirty, drive for about an hour and a half to court, handle the case there, drive to another courthouse, then go back to office to sign new clients, and work on the next day's case. On a good day, I'd get out of the office around eight. I'd head to the bar afterwards, and drink until about ten thirty or eleven about three days a week. I'd get home around ten and hang out with my roommate (I truly detest living alone), until from twelve-thirty to two. Heavy tobacco use and further drinking was usually a staple of these hangouts - I never used any illegal drugs or caffeine. I'd say about ninety percent of my meals were either takeout, bar food, or whatever crap I could grab on the road. I would average about five-to-eight sexual partners a year, usually of the one-night-stand variety. (For the record, I would like to say that I never, ever drove drunk, or showed up in court or at the office impaired in any way.) \n\nLike I said, I loved my job and was having a blast, but I could see that it wasn't any way to live the rest of my life, or even five years. I took a somewhat less-paying, lower-stress job out in an extremely rural area. I dramatically reduced my alcohol intake, started exercising more, and began cooking for myself at home. These days, I'm usually home by six. I'll cook and eat dinner, and be done with that by seven.The thing is, over the last month, by seven, I'm just completely *wiped*. I'll go to bed by eight and wake up all groggy and shit around six. I have no idea why. I had major surgery four months ago for diverticulitis. I'm not sure if that's related, but I thought it was worth mentioning. \n\nI don't know if this is just the last ten-plus years catching up with me (I partied pretty hard through high school, college, and law school as well), a latent symptom of my recent surgery, a response to the attached social isolation of moving out here, just some bullshit seasonal reaction to it being dark all the time, and not being around city lights at all hours at night, or possibly something more serious. I don't think I'm depressed - I have a great job, good friends less than two hours away, and am - in all things other than this issue - one hundred percent satisfied with my life. I just want to have my energy back, and make sure this isn't something that could be more concerning. I had a physical before and after my surgery (chest, stomach, and brain scans), and they didn't see anything about that - so I hope a physical defect isn't the issue. \n\nEither way, I would very much appreciate any input you can give.

First you're a hypochondriac, then you're a drug seeker, finally they admit it is a real, possibly unknown physical disease that may never be diagnosed. Please help!", "author": "MikeYPG1337", "self_text": "Hello everyone, 25 year old male, 130lbs, 5'10\" tall, on medications: Dexamethasone, Toradol, generic anti-histamines, corticosteroid puffer, sometimes antibiotics. Family history of: heart disease, kidney disease, various cancers (prostate, thyroid, pancreatic), autoimmune &amp; heamatological disease (Lupus, Thalassemia, Ulcerative colitis, autoimmume thyroid disease, diabetes, Psoriasis)\n\nAfter visiting countless doctors and emergency rooms/hospitals, I am coming here out of desparation after the best doctor in Ontario admitted that my case has him stumped. I am deteriorating faster than ever and I know I do not have much longer to live\n \nSymptoms =\n\n-- Unexplained &amp; recurring fevers, with meningitis type symptoms of stiff &amp; painful neck, base of skull pain, photophobia as well as sudden swelling of eyes with a lot of puss-like crust that seals them shut, swelling of wrist, ankles, feet, throat, uvula, ears, sometimes other tissues / organs as well, and a general feeling of being deathly ill. These \"attacks\" / \"episodes\" last anywhere from 2 days to 4 or 5 weeks. \n\n-- Localized hives with redness around them, these hives have an itchy burn to them and either pop up at random, or after exposure to sunlight, artificial lights, or water. Can happen anywhere on the body but a small circular area. I chalked this up to \"allergies\" for years but lately Ive noticed it doesn't matter what season it is &amp; eliminating food that could cause allergies has been completely ineffective. Interestingly the association between water &amp; this symptom has always been evident\n\n-- Widespread area mainly top of hands up to eblows where all of the skin develops a bright red tone, becomes itchy, and feels like a 2nd degree burn. Wrapping with cold clothes and other physical traditional burn treatments helps\n\n-- large red area, with angry red circle in center, with a whitehead. Usually these are small but sometimes they swell up massively &amp; prevent sitting or laying down properly. They appear to be infections but antibiotics does nothing whereas corticosteroids &amp; toradol help (both for this and many other symptoms this holds true)\n\nActual infections:\n1. Gangrene of toe / foot (that needed lancing and draining but started going septic despite that treatment)\n2. Respiratory, bronch/strep at the same time 2 years in a row confirmed by culture\n3. Skin / muscle, these are rare compared to the phenomena that are clearly not infections due to their response to medication, but when it happens it is usually more severe and immediate responds to antibiotics so its obvious\n\n-- Extremely fast / thick skin growth on bottom lip &amp; bottoms of feet, both left and right. Hands used to be unaffected. The thick skins color is very yellow on the soles of feet but not the other areas which has led to less worry about my liver than I think is necessary (Jaundice of mucus membranes / general skin jaundice has been noted in my ER records). The thick skin is very painful and causes the healthy skin around it to split and tear open from pressure, causing bleeding and dramatically increasing the local risk of infection. Worst area is the feet. A 2 or 3 inch thick layer of skin grows even when I am off my feet which is almost always now. Doctor thought it was classic callous when I was more active, but ended up classifying it as Hyperkeratosis once it became apparent that activity or pressure wasn't the cause. If the skin is cut off or treated in any way it comes back more aggresively, growing quicker than before and expands further. If it is not treated, it grows at a fast rate still but causes the skin around it to split open from the tightness etc. Very frustrating and debilitating. No treatments or remedies have prevented it from reoccuring or reduced the severity\n\n-- Hundreds of scars / stretch mark looking things primarily around my buttocks and thighs and knees, these are unexplained by growth, weight gain/loss or any other common cause\n\n-- Spontaneous bleeding, coughing up large amounts of blood, bright red poo, and one time where I woke up feeling deathly ill and nauseated &amp; threw up a nice brownish redish coffee ground style sludge... And a lot of it\n\n-- Bright purple/pinkish urine, or dark brown/black urine that is always abnormally foamy and has a white subatance settle at the bottom\n\n-- Thick, almost jello consistency / rubbery consistency phlegm. When I cough up stuff I could literally chew it if I wanted like a piece of meat or gum or roll it into a ball in my fingers. The mucous/phlegm is usually yellow, brown or blackish \n\n-- Shortness of breath\n\n-- Heart racing, gets worse with even mild excersize, and episodes of fainting due to standing or switching position too quickly\n\n-- Hearing imparment from very young/birth in left ear &amp; total inability to smell\n\n-- Vision loss getting progressively worse\n\n-- Metallic taste in mouth\n\n-- Massive &amp; excruciatingly painful hematomas / fluid under skin even after very minor injuries\n\n-- Superhuman metabolic rate... Always been very thin really, despite for years now I have eatten almost 10000 calories a day. That's right... Not 1000... ten thousand calories a day! Definitely over 5 thousand, and I have never been able to gain weight except one short period of my life and I could not identify why I was able to put on weight at that time. In recent months I have given up my extreme eating habit as it seems to have no effect on my nutrition or ability to be healthy, amd probably consume from 2000 to 4000 cal a day and have plateaued where I do not gain weight but am also not losing weight anymore\n\n-- Dental problems, early extractions etc despite being born with \"perfect teeth\" and taking care of them\n\n-- Flank pain made worse by eating, made better after pooing\n\n-- Sparse, thick, coarse hair everywhere except head, pubic area. Those 2 areas have more normal feeling hair and its denser there. Hair grows slowly everywhere except those 2 areas. If you shave my leg it will grow back over months but if you shave my head I'll have a full head of hair in a few weeks. \n\n-- Brittle, fast growing nails &amp; deformed baby toenail on each foot (mother has the same issue with baby toes on each of her feet)\n\n-- Chest pain, back pain, bone pain, muscle pain\n\n-- Muscle spasms so severe they cause my fingers / toes to twist all weird and lock themselves up. Think of the foot cramp after swimming but your entire leg, arm, hand or foot &amp; it happens at random when you move or use a muscle or muscle group\n\n-- Sudden, temporary lower limb paralysis documented at least 4 times by my medical records\n\n-- Sensitive to cold\n\n-- Nose bleeds\n\n-- Drenching night sweats\n\nNervous system / pain receptor defect... A  wound on finger causes pain in ribs, back or leg for example. Especially when the wound is touched while healing. Another example is; wound on my leg will hurt and cause the same pain happening in that area, but in my abdominal area, or arms as well \n\n-- Easy bruising, bone breaks, slow healing \n\n-- Ridiculous / out of proportion strength or ability to harness adrenaline? At my sickest point in recent times I was still able to lift a 350 to 450 pound object up multiple flights of stairs, being the only person on one side and the other side needing 3 or 4 men much larger than myself and they could hardly do it. This isn't the only example of my strength being out of proportion to what I SHOULD be capable of especially given my physical condition, but it is the most obvious example\n\nAnd many many more physical issues.

When I was 12/13, I got tackled in basketball and slammed really hard with my left shoulder (at a considerable speed) against the basketball post. Felt like my left shoulder was broken but went to the doctor and he looked at it and said nothing was wrong. Since then, my shoulder cracks 10x time more than the right one and I feel like it is out of place at times;\n\n\\- A year ago, was doing some pushups on one arm and felt a numbing, sharp feeling on my left forearm. Since then, when grabbing or doing pushups of any sort, my pinky finger feels numb and I feel something weird on my forearm;\n\n\\- Fast forward to like 5 months ago, I was doing a Monkey Bar exercice and felt it was a good idea to try and rotate myself in one arm at the end/last bar and going back without landing (so stupid...). Of course I felt pain on my upper arm, almost like on the middle part inside if that makes any sense.\n\n\\- Since then, the injury kinda healed by itself. I was on and off exercicing and was never really bothered by it. But as of last week, the pain as returned.\n\nIt's not HUGE pain and I only really feel it when my left arm is over my torso, my left hand is touching my right shoulder and I grab my left elbow with my right hand and slightly push the arm up a bit. From there I feel something stretching but also some pain in the middle of the upper arm (almost coming from the inside, as I've mentioned). On the first days, my shoulder also hurted kinda on the back and top and could lift my arm complety up without feeling mild pain.\n\nI know I should be going to a specialist, but as of now I'd like to know what you think it might be. I know it's a shot in the dark since I'm merely typing in here and not SHOWING the problem, but would like to get some feedback anyway.\n\nAlso, is it advisable to do certain exercices to help - depending on the gravity of the problem of course? I heard people mentioning dead hangs for shoulder problems and general stretching with elastic bands.\n\nThank you very much!\n\nSorry for my english", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

That said, I've been blown off by 2 dermatologists after a PCP referral to the first and a second opinion visit to a different dermatologist for myself. I'm going to schedule another visit with my PCP next week, and I would like to be able to float some ideas by him. That's why I'm here.\n\nThe symptoms: My cloths hurt. The people I've talked to about it asked if it was an itch. It's hard to explain, but I'd say its more like the opposite of an itch. My inclination isn't to scratch, but to have NOTHING touch my skin. Being a little more descriptive, it sort of feels like my skin can feel every individual fiber in my shirt (hypersensitivity?) and that I'm wearing a burlap sack and not cotton. \n\nThe sensation does seem to wax and wane over the course of a day, but it never really goes away until I get home from work and can take my shirt off.  When it gets particularly bad (usually if its cold out and I've been out with a coat on, which puts extra pressure on my skin, or even just wearing a seatbelt) the sensation can spread down to my legs mostly my upper thighs, but the issue seems mostly contained to my trunk, stomach chest and lower back, with my both sides of my stomach being the most common place I feel it. If I go out for hours with a heavy coat, when I get home and get undressed I swear I can feel the air itself aggravating my skin, but that doesn't last long.\n\nOn a good Saturday I can stay around the house in my boxers with a light blanket and I don't feel it at all.\n\nAbout me:\n\n36 years old, male, white, 511, 170, eat moderately health consciously, and am a smoker. I do know I should quit. I live in southern Louisiana.\n\nMedical history is difficult because I never really had one. Typically I get a sinus infection every 2 years or so and that sucks but I've barely been to the doctor in the last 15 years. The only exception is that I was diagnosed with secondary Syphilis which I was treated for and the follow up test was fine. That was last year, and this problem predates it by a few years, (I'd say it started right around the time I turned 30) but has definitely been getting worse. As a result of that, they did a bunch of other tests and apparently I'm an ox. The only number they said was slightly off was my good cholesterol, which was slightly low.\n\nRandom facts:\n\nSeems to get worse in the winter, though whether that has to do with dry skin, more clothing pressing on my skin or something else entirely I don't know. I do know that my dermatologist recommended a moisturizing routine which I have followed daily for the last 2 months to no effect. I was also prescribed an oral steroid and a topical one, also to no effect.\n\nThe sensation can be quite uncomfortable, but as long as it doesn't get worse, I can live with it.\n\nTried oatmeal and salt baths.\n\nTried taking cold showers only, as showers tended to make it worse. \n\nI even tried not taking a shower for four days (had two days off leading into the weekend), which was not great, but worse, didn't do anything but make me more uncomfortable. \n\nWhen I get in bed at night, I feel the sensation via my sheets..... but after a while of not moving, it seems to go away and then I feel like I'm laying on sheets again and not a burlap spread.\n\nOh, and I'm a dog and cat person and I have 3 cats and a medium sized dog. I asked my dermatologist if I could have developed some kind of pet allergy and she said no.\n\nI personally think my skin looks slightly red and irritated, not all over but in tiny little patches, but I've asked other people to look at it and they say it looks normal, and at this point I'd almost take their judgement over mine as mine is probably a little skewed. I have no other discernible rash. I don't really have anything to take a photo of. Its almost frustratingly invisible. \n\nMy skin doesn't feel dry to me, even before the lotion marathon, and never seen any types of scaly or dry ashy patches. No bumps, blisters or raised skin either.\n\nI mostly wear 100 percent cotton hanes tshirts around the house. I have tried two different brands. No effect. \n\nApologies, I intended to make this short and concise, but I failed. \n\nAny ideas I can bring to my doctor?\n\nThanks, especially if you read this to the end!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I've had eczema as a kid and it reminded me of those days. The only difference was that this itch seemed to be all over my body, not just select locations.

I'm not sure these are warts, but if they are should I try to treat them? Should I worry about touching things, people, or other parts of my body in the meantime? Could these two issues be related? I can't figure out why my Eczema would suddenly flare up for the first time in 15 years when I haven't changed anything in my daily life.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated as I'm starting to get fairly worried.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

For about 3 weeks I've been receiving testosterone injections to see if this is the cause of my depression, foggy brain and anxiety. I'm suppose to take my next shot tomorrow (I take them every week). The reason I'm asking this question is because within a few hours, usually that night, I experience what starts to feel like normalcy for me. For years I've had those symptoms (depression + anxiety) and after the 2 shots I've gotten I felt like my old self but only for roughly 24 hours. In less than 2 days I go back to a depressed, foggy brain anxious state. Everywhere I have read says you will NOT feel the effects overnight. Most say several weeks. Is it possible that I am feeling the effects that quickly? It seems very coincidental that within the same day of receiving both of those injections that I feel normal. I didn't expect anything of these shots, I really didn't think they would do anything. My other question would be why am I only experiencing these effects for less than 24 hours?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFWIW: The only reason I'm asking here is because I don't see my doctor for another month or so. I'm just curious if it's even possible, and why it's only lasting 24 hours. Any other thoughts are welcome. Thanks.\n\nAdditional info:\n\nI just go to the local pharmacy who do the injections for me. I give them the vial and shot. I've been injecting for 20 days so tomorrow is my next shot.

{"post_id": "e1c0f0", "created_utc": 1574663353, "title": "Early Satiety problem", "author": "438484", "self_text": "\nHello,\n\nI\u2019m a 22 year old male and have early satiety. I don\u2019t have the capacity to eat a normal portion of food by societies standards. I get full after eating a relatively small amount. I have been dealing with this for a few years so I\u2019ll just give an overview of my story.\n\nEarly 2015: I am able to eat what a normal 18 year old can at this time, but start to notice I eat a little less. Weight: 150 lbs  Height: 5\u201910\u201d(I\u2019m still the same height)\n\nMid Summer 2015: Within a week of being able to eat normally all of a sudden I got full after eating a small amount. I also had a burning sensation in my stomach and was bloated all the time. At this time half a sandwich (regular sandwich bread, 2 slices of ham, cheese, lettuce and tomato) would get me full. Even a glass of water would make me feel like I just had a meal. I was also constipated all the time and went a week with no bowel movement. Over the next couple of weeks I began to rapidly loose weight ( I\u2019m a naturally skinny guy with a high metabolism). By the end of the summer I weighed 130 lbs. I lost 20 pounds in less than 2 months. \n\nFall 2015: I tried eating as much as I could but it was no use. I continued to loose weight so I decided that it was time to see a doctor. \n\nEarly 2016: I was referred to a gastroenterologist. I had an upper endoscopy done and found that I had chronic gastritis. I also had tests done for H. Pylori and all other standard causes for gastritis and all came back negative. I was told to not drink caffeine, no fatty foods, no spicy foods, no dairy etc. I was also told to eat smaller portions so I only ate until I was comfortably full. I followed the doctors orders and followed the diet plan. I was also given medication for the heartburn.\n\n2017: At this point I reach lowest weight as an adult at 120 lbs. After eating better I no longer had that burning sensation in my stomach and was not bloated anymore. My stomach felt fine, but I still felt full after eating and a small amount. I was eating a little more though. A small amount of water still made me full. My constipation was not such a big issue anymore. The amount I ate decreased since I ate smaller portions and only ate until I was comfortably full. The amount I could eat fluctuated a bit and could gain a couple pounds but would again loose the weight I gained. My weight around this time averaged from 120 - 125 lbs. \n\nEarly 2018: I was referred to an oncologist by my general doctor. I had blood work done again for all the standards for gastritis like H. Pylori, but again came back negative. I also had a CT scan done but the only thing that showed up was that I had a stool backup. I was given a laxative for that. I was also found to have low white blood cell count. It wasn\u2019t low enough to worry, but it was enough to keep an eye on. I started eating until I was more full as I was getting really frustrated and was also more lenient with my diet. Weight: 122\n\nLate 2018: I checked up on my low white blood cell count and it was still low. The oncologist was just monitoring it for now. I was referred to a Gastro Dr again for my early satiety. At this time the only issue I feel I have is that. I had no burning sensations in my stomach anymore and didn\u2019t feel bloated. I had a gastric emptying study for both solids  and liquids done and was  found to have gastroparesis for emptying liquids only. I hade no issues with emptying solids. I was told to follow the same diet I had been told to follow before and was given iberogast to take for the gastroparesis. The iberogast helped a little, but it might have just been the placebo effect.\n\nPresent day: I still feel full when eating a relatively small amount of food and water. My stomach feels fine but the amount I eat has not improved. For example, a regular sized sandwich like the one I mentioned earlier is enough to really fill me up. I don\u2019t drink much water with my food anymore, because if I do I want be able to eat almost anything. This has also affected my social life since I can\u2019t just go out with friends and family without my diet being a burden. I can\u2019t go to restaurants and order a dish because I\u2019ll only be able to eat half of it or even less. I have scheduled times to eat throughout the day. If I only ate when I was hungry I would eat a small portion once a day. If I only ate until I was comfortably full I would begin to loose even more weight. I\u2019m really self conscious about my current weight and don\u2019t want to be so skinny. At the moment I weigh 122 lbs and am 5\u2019 10\u201d. I have gotten really frustrated and try to eat as much as I can but no luck. I can\u2019t go to the doctor since I don\u2019t have insurance anymore and can\u2019t afford it. I haven\u2019t been able to check up on my low blood cell count or check if I still have gastritis. The only symptom I have is early satiety. The doctors I\u2019ve been to don\u2019t know what\u2019s the root cause of my problem. I really don\u2019t know what else to do. I\u2019m almost at the point of accepting that this will be my reality for the rest of my life. I ask for any help with this problem and would greatly appreciate it. I know this was bit long but if you read all of this I sincerely thank you for your effort. \n\nOne other detail that might or might not be relevant. Before all this happened I didn\u2019t really burp at all and much less could do it at will. As soon as this happens I started burping after I ate and could do it at will. It\u2019s not uncontrollable burping by the way.\n\n\nThank you", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I went through a series of physio sessions over a few years and it seems to go away though back pain and posture (particularly in my mid to lower back which doesn't' straighten like everybody else as easily) continued.  \n\n\nWhen I was 27/28, I began to feel dull pain in my lower right side of my back ( I though it was Kidney pain) so I went to a doctor. He had a good feel around and couldn't find anything unusual about the Kidney area but did feel my liver under my ribs which hurt when he touched it. He showed some concern so booked me in for some blood tests and ultrasound. Liver function blood tests came back fine, and the Ultrasound came back find (slight inflammation but nothing abnormal). So the Doctor called me with the results and told me there were no evident issues with the Liver and that I could follow it up further if I wanted, otherwise all good.  \n\n\n6 months on, I occasionally still feel the dull pain, especially when I have slept in funny angles, and the pain takes a few days to dissipate, with me focussing on keeping my posture correct. I have a theory that the liver pain could be linked to my original skeletal problems, with perhaps a bone or some ribs rubbing/pushing on the liver causing the pain? I have no medical background or knowledge, just deduced what makes sense to me based on my symptoms.  \n\n\nI should add also, something I think could also be linked loosely. I have a minor deviated septum that i have never had looked at or fixed, which has resulted in me not being able to sneeze without holding the sneeze in (even hands free my body naturally holds it in). This means when I sneeze, if i am not stood upright I experience pain throughout my torso, particularly around my ribcage. I think this might have caused either some minor rib damage or bruising internally that has gone left unchecked?  \n\n\nThanks in advance.

After a couple of days, the chills and pain went away.\n\nI went to a walk in clinic (I was away from my family physician) and they did a strep test which came back negative. The physician said it was 100% mono.\n\nWhen I got back to my family doctor, she ordered a CBC test and a test for mono. Everything with the CBC test came back normal except for my platelet level which came back HIGH (450, so nothing too crazy). The test also came back negative for mono. \n\nAround the two week mark, I noticed my underarms were painful possible due to lymph nodes there being swollen, as well as near my groin. Those went away after a few days, however. \n\nI returned to the doctor two days ago, and they ordered basically every STD test in existence, and said the most likely cause was oral chlamydia, but were also a little concerned about HIV due to the additional lymph nodes being enlarged at one point.\n\nI\u2019m waiting for those results to come back, but I\u2019m not sure how much sense those make with what I have.

What is it?\n\nThis is a throwaway account because it's quite embarrassing and weird. Also, this is going to be a long post because I'm so bewildered as to what this was/is, I don't even know how to describe it well and I'm hoping enough detail will lead to an answer.\n\nSo a while ago (I sincerely don't know how long, I have some mild unrelated memory problems that make estimating time difficult for me, could have been weeks or months) I noticed a hard little lump on the top of my penis, near the base of the shaft. And when I say little, I mean tiny, like maybe 2mm x 1mm. It wasn't perfectly round, kind of irregularly shaped. It was hard. It was very close to the surface of the skin, and it was darker than the skin around it. It felt like it was just in the skin itself because I could pinch it with my fingers and kind of get under it. It had kind of sharp edges, and almost felt like a large grain of sand stuck between layers of skin.\n\nBecause if it's appearance and location, I was pretty concerned. But since I'm an idiot, not concerned enough to do anything proactive about it, just concerned enough to keep an eye on it and plan to try and muster the courage at my next checkup to tell my doctor about something very awkward.\n\nIt never hurt, but it was just rather annoying. Like I said, it was on the top of my penis towards the base of the shaft, happening to be right where I put my thumb when I'm holding my dick while I pee, so I felt and noticed it all the time, and every time it just annoyed me and reminded me of this concerning thing I was so stubbornly ignoring.\n\nSo, today, less than 2 weeks from the checkup appointment I had planned to talk to my doctor about it, I go to pee and I feel it under my thumb as usual, but it feels different. It has a slightly different texture and moves more. At first I thought I scraped it (the skin over the bump was very thin) and there was just a loose little scab. So when I finished my business I bent down to take a closer look, and there was something...coming out of the bump. \n\nThis of course immediately terrified me as my thoughts went straight to it being some kind of parasite or egg. So I grabbed the little bit sticking out of my skin with my thumb and index fingernails and pulled it out, fully expecting something horrifying to happen, but it ended up being fairly mundane. I pulled out a tiny little... something. That's what I don't know. It at least didn't seem to be living, which was relieving. But I have no idea what it was. It was so small that I had trouble really getting a good look at it, even once it was in my hand. It was a kind of tan, maybe very pale amber colored...I don't know. Pebble? Spec? I can't find a good word to describe it. Just a tiny little tan thing roughly the shape of a very tiny egg.\n\nUpon further inspection I saw what looked like a little strand of hair inside it, just a squiggly black line just under the not quite opaque surface. This led me to my first theory of it being something like an ingrown hair that my body/immune system surrounded in this weird substance that hardened around it. However, through some internet research I could find no such thing or anything similar to corroborate my theory. \n\nMore internet searching proved futile, mostly leading to different kinds of cysts, all of which didn't fit the description of my mystery lump. I feel I big part of my problem was not really knowing what to search, because I couldn't describe it.\n\nThe area of skin where it was is basically fine. There's a slightly open bit but you can barely see it, just looks like a pore bigger than the rest, and doesnt hurt or feel raw.\n\nThat's about all I've got. It seems like I'm fine now and most of my worrying was unnecessary in the end, but I just really want to know what it was. If anyone has any clarifying questions I'll answer them, there maybe be things I forgot or details I didn't think were important. Otherwise here's some other basic information about me that may be relevant.\n\n- 20 years old\n- male (obviously)\n- Caucasian\n- am sexually active, but have never not used a condom\n- have had a total of 4 sexual partners\n- have never gotten checked for STIs yet\n- only left the northeast United States once in my life, went on a cruise to the Bahamas when I was 12\n- no other skin conditions besides mild-moderate acne on my face\n- only thing I take a a men's one a day multivitamin, no medicines", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Piriformis Syndrome? HELP PLEASE!\n\nDocs thanks for your input,  will try to keep it short: \n\nAbout a year and half ago while doing back squats with moderate weight and no belt I felt a spasm/ weakness in the left side of my back. Spasm went away fairly quickly but a couple of days later I had pain the upper part of my buttocks, mostly all the time and tenderness to the touch as well. Pain would \u201c\u2018move around\u201d sometime more in the buttocks other times more towards the center of the body above the SI joint/sacrum. \n\nWent to see several doctor and physical therapists etc, got steroid shots and mostly got better but never perfect. I got an MRI that showed disc protrusion in L4/L5 touching upon L5 nerve root. \n\n6 weeks ago, while doing some very light squats, same spasm and two days later massive pain in leg. \n Went to hospital and got another MRI which is identical to first one , got epidural shot in spine and Piriformis and am doing better but still not close to ok. \n\nMy problem is as follows: \n\n1 . My back does not hurt at all. \n2. I don\u2019t have \u201cradiating pain\u201d down the butt and let that feels electric \n3. My pain is described as follows:\n\n1. Two major areas of pain that come and go, one being the upper butt area with a lot of tenderness and two , the outer calf/Aquiles tend\u00f3n \u00e1rea \n2. Pain gets exacerbated when sitting, walking and sleeping are ok although I do have a dull ache in the sacrum area\n3. This is the biggest thing!!: I cannot extend my left leg when sitting. When trying to extend the leg sitting in a 90 degree angle on the floor , extreme pain around hamstrings and buttock. Almost as if something inside the back of the leg is tied in a knot that pulls from my upper butt and prohibits extension \n4. I do have mild tingling below the knee when standing after sitting but goes away in a few minutes, exactly like when you get up from a long time on the toilet\n5. Yoga poses standing on left (bad leg) are painful and wobbly especially if I need to extend leg fully, get a pulling pain inside butt. \n6. I have visibly lost muscle mass on left butt, it looks and feels dead vs right \n\nI have been to several doctors including neurosurgeon and have gotten all  sorts of diagnoses including herniated disc, SI joint irritation, muscle contraction, etc but nothing that makes sense. \n\nYes I do have a herniated disc, but it is identical in the image from a year ago and there was a time for like 6 months that I was pain free, but the problem extending the leg never went away completely. \n\nI am doing bykram yoga everyday and it has been very painful but helps, I am no longer on meds only occasional painkillers if it gets bad. \n\nPlease let me know your thoughts, I am better but desparte since the latest docs told me that if the epidural does not work I will probably need a micro discectomy. But I am convinced that my problem is the butt/hip area and not in the lumbar spine. \n\nAm I in denial that I have busted my back or does my story make some sense? \n\nI am desperate for answers, please help!!! \n\nThanks so much, let me know if you have any questions or comments!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I\u2019m an 18 year old female that started dating a certain guy early on in college. He ended up sexually assaulting me (anally). We never engaged in vaginal sex. We only had sex once, which was the assault. I got STI screening approximately two weeks after the assault and came back negative for all STIs. However, I plan to go back three months after the initial exposure to be sure that I am STI-free. I have not had any STI-reminiscent symptoms besides a constant tingling in my vulvar area. It in nonstop. I also have what feels like a painless cyst under the skin on the upper area of my labia majora. I have had very mild, infrequent burning, almost no numbness, and I have inspected the areas thoroughly and have seen no appearance of sores. I have educated myself thoroughly on the symptoms and presence of various STIs and at the moment seem not to exhibit at least the visible symptoms. Since the assault, I have thoroughly examined myself daily, even in the areas where no sexual contact occurred. I have always been prone to yeast infections, even since I was a small child, so it could possibly be that. Oddly enough, I thought since I was anally raped I would have had symptoms in that area but have had none. I\u2019ve always struggled with digestive issues such as constipation, but otherwise have had no change in bowel habits (a slight bit of shooting anal pains but nothing outside of what I had to begin with; I\u2019ve also been struggling with anal fissures but I have had those long before the assault as well due to what I assume is poor digestion). I have had no sores in or around the mouth as well. I had some throat bumps, but my grandmother is a nurse and said it appeared to be pharyngitis (I have had chronic pharyngitis and throat bumps even before I was ever sexually involved with anyone). I have had some burning urination, but it is very mild and I am almost always dehydrated so that may be the cause. I\u2019ve struggled with burning urination my entire life anyway. I must also mention that this person is the only one I have ever had sexual contact with, and to my knowledge I had never come into contact with herpes even before that. It has been a little over two months since the assault occurred, and I hope to be screened once again in about a month or so. So, anyone that is willing to provide a possible explanation or advice, I would very much appreciate it as I am worried sick. Regardless, I still intend to get screened for herpes and all other STIs again. Thank you! :)", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

An ER doc told me it could be conversion disorder, but I went to my psych and she laughed for a moment and said \"no, I would have told you.\" I moved cross-country for school and again tried a psych, one I'd seen before, and she was equally unimpressed, but looked at all my data and although she didn't laugh, she said I need to go back and get more attentive doctors, so I've been working with my PCP. \n\nAbout me: 37m, 6'3\", generally between 280 and 300, Native American from Texas living in Oregon. Prior to this I have PTSD and Depression, blind in one eye, tinnitus. No history of diabetes, blood pressure is generally great but can spike even in non-stressful situations.\n\nMy accident: I was riding in the back seat of a bus, and said bus hit a cow. I was thrown down the aisle and hit my head, landed on my butt, blacked out for a few seconds, spent the rest of the night kind of frantic and nobody took me to the hospital, even with badly bleeding legs.\n\nSymptoms: starting in December 2018 immediately after my accident I began to have hand tremors when trying to eat, write, whatever. They are generally bad, but at times they calm down. From that point forward, my walking became worse and worse, starting with extremely jerky legs and walking, but cooling down to poor balance and a near-inability to walk on angled ground (think uphill). From my calf down I have no sensation except the occasional shooting pain to my buttocks, my feet have barely any sensation and alternate between tingly and burning to sometimes very itchy. It's more pronounced on my right, but increasingly both legs are having issues. \n\nMy back hurts, generally a 4-5, sometimes a 7-8. At times I have debilitating pain in a band around my waist from about the top of my buttcrack to about 2 inches above that, which makes it difficult to roll over in bed or walk. I am slower than before, weaker than before (my leg press at the gym got cut in half immediately, and I eventually stopped going since it was getting weaker and weaker).  Sitting is painful, with pain just at the top of my buttcrack, but a different pain from the other pain nearby, more of a sharp, focal pain, worse when I'm in a recliner. \n\nAfter the accident, my voice started to get gravelly and kind of husky in a very movie star way, I liked it. But it stayed like that for weeks, and suddenly, at the end of February, I suddenly started stuttering, accompanying a bad tremor day. The next day I had less of a voice. The day after that, none. I used to be able to speak for a few minutes at a time, but that tapered off from once a couple of days, to not at all. I have only spoken about 3 words in 3 months. Speaking feels like my brain is making all the right moves but the muscles in my throat and mouth don't. I can make \"d\" noises in my throat. I used to be able to whisper, but even that got quiet and sporadic and quit after a couple of months.\n\nMy vision, which I mean wasn't great to begin with, has worsened, with it being increasingly difficult to look at the stars at night since they're all accompanied by a smaller, slightly fainter double. My vision also blurs, and when I wave my hand in front of my face it my hand has trails that last for about half a second. Also, I have neck pain, can't bend my neck too far to the left or right, and generally hurt when I roll my neck. Headaches range from all over to stabbing behind the eye pain or pain behind my eyebrows. I have a hiatal hernia, but I'm also recovering from h pylori via antibiotics.\n\nCurrent medication: propranolol, gabapentin, sertraline, omeprazole\n\nDiagnoses and findings:  \n\\-C6 spinal disc compromising nerve root in lateral recess  \n\\-C4-C5 minimal disc bulge  \n\\-mild levocurvature of the thoracic spine,  \"Accentuation of focal kyphosis at T9 secondary to anterior wedging of the T9 vertebral body with up to 20% anterior height loss. \"  \n\\-\" At T5-6, there is a small disc protrusion which results in mild spinal canal narrowing.

I'm just worried and don't want to wait too long and end up needing to lose one of the boys :/", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I'm fairly certain that it is flea bites due to my dog having fleas a few months ago and my doctor told me it was most likely flea bites as well.

{"post_id": "e44qkt", "created_utc": 1575153185, "title": "Undiagnosed headaches - Medical Mystery of 14 months now", "author": "ReallyAnxiousBud", "self_text": "Ill preface this by stating the required subreddit post information before my write up of symptoms in the last ~year.\n\n* 19 years old\n* White\n* 75kg\n* 182cm\n* Canada\n* Existing conditions include but are not limited to : Depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder,\n* Current meds are Venlafaxine XR 150MG, Cyclobenzaprine 10mg, Naproxen (as needed) 250mg x2 \n\n**SYMPTOMS**\n\nAround 365 days ago I realized this odd sensation that I would get seemingly at random. I noticed it\u2019s a dull pinch that feels like any part of my head or neck is being pinched for 1-2 seconds. It\u2019s a very accurate pain that is easy to know where on my head it is affecting me.  \n\nThe amount of times I noticed this pinch headache is about 5-65x a day. Usually located in the upper back region of my head.  \n\nThe pain usually feels like either a pinch or a dull squeezing sensation.  \n\nI used to receive an odd rush of pressure when I would straighten my neck after having it bent for a noticeable period. I no longer felt this since September.  \n\nFormerly, when I used to consume cannabis, I had never a problem with headaches or head pressure, but soon I realized that I would receive almost incapacitating pressure on my head, forcing me to sit down. I have not consumed cannabis since, (November 2018) \n\nI am aware that I have been thinking about suicide almost daily now, multiple times a day in which I think about it. I have cut off my main friend group and no longer talk to any of them.  \n\nI\u2019m doing poorly socially, as I can not indulge on the same intoxicants as my peers and am not able to hold positive conversation or see positive people, it depresses me to see people who aren\u2019t visibly depressed or anxious.  \n\nI broke up with my girlfriend of 6 months as the headaches made me short tempered and caused me to be more upset with her and others. This is a big reason as to why I am no longer social. \n\n I feel as If I cannot afford to have people know about my condition and thoughts.  \n\nI do have muscle spasms when I lay down \n\nI feel certain pains when I bend my neck and it\u2019s as if there are needles in my vertebrae \n\nOften when just breathing I can feel my neck crack and move as if im bending it \n\nMy neck can get \u201cstuck\u201d it sounds like a loud cracking sound when I twist my neck in  \n\ncertain very specific directions, it must be moved slowly in the opposite direction and makes a grinding noise and feels very uncomfortable as I move it backward \n\nMy jaw often makes very loud popping noises at the \u201chinges\u201d when I fully extend it  \n\nSometimes when I eat and move my jaw in specific locations, I get a tingling sensation of relief that rushes up to my head and pulses momentarily for a second or two \n\nIn the past 2 months a recent development had been made, between my lower back and my left leg, there seems to be a reoccurring pain that happens when I sit, in no matter posture for any amount of time, \n\nthe movement in my leg causes a numb feel and some tingling pain that moves from the pains initial spot to my foot \n\nI\u2019ve tried Valium, Indomethacin, cyclobenzaprine, and higher doses of venlafaxine, but to no avail. I do not notice any reduction in frequency or severity of the aches.  \n\nI\u2019ve tried IMS and Acupuncture, Acupuncture was unsuccessful, however some IMS needle sites have given me a headache and have contracted muscles around my skull  \n\nI\u2019ve yet to come across any practical means to reduce either the severity or the frequency of my headaches \n\nI\u2019ve gotten a CT scan of my skull and an XRAY of my neck, these tests both showed negative results  \n\nMy neurologist has told me that he thinks it is just a tension type headache that is occurring because of poor posture \n\nI believe I have a pinched nerve; I am going to physio weekly and an active rehab program 2x a week  \n\nRecently I have been practicing TMJ exercises prescribed to me by my physiotherapist,  \n\nMy orthodontist is making me a mouthguard to wear on my lower row of teeth during the day and during sleep \n\nGenerally, when I miss my routine neck exercises/ stretches I feel worse the next day, I get headaches more often and they\u2019re more prevalent  \n\nOver time my depression has caught up with me, I am unable to stay calm and tell myself that it will be fine and go away \n\nI more recently got another CT scan of my head and neck but with indicator dye and the test results came back perfect.
