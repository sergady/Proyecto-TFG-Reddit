I personally do not know exactly how long because of my memory fog. Im sorry if it seems i go off on tangents because i do not know better and this is the way my brain thinks now. Thank you for understanding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIm was  a 20 yr/o Texas a&amp;m college student that recently had encephalopathy after an upper respiratory infection and the doctor prescribed me strong steroids and then it got way out of hand from there (dexamethasone into prednisone i believe).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese were my symptoms:\n\nBloody nose, miserably failing the cognitive test, fuzziness and increased pressure inside skull, swelling, involuntary twitching/muscle convulsions, muscle weakness (to the point where I can't move at all), seizure like activity that didn't cause brain damage (more like panic attacks that i have no control over what so ever), the inability to sleep (extreme insomnia), catatonic activity, involuntary actions like breathing would seem voluntary, slowed or slurred speech, inability to think coherently, agitation towards everything, high heart rate (resting constantly above 120 and even peaked at 240 at a point during a non epileptic seizure), peripheral neuropathy (still have this symptom even after IVIG), extreme fatigue, comatose like activity but will still react to pain (fingernail pain/sternum rub), general fear and distrust of everything, joint pain, stiffness in toes/fingers, inconsistent stools (very small, constipated, or diarrhea), burning while peeing or even the inability to pee, extreme sensitivity (noises, words, temperature), constantly parched throat (throat would also feel very heavy/tight at times), dry cough, mania, depression, memory fog, warped view of reality, my back broke out from what appears to be pimples??? it might be a rash because its itchy, and finally the worst symptom is the changed perception of time (seconds would seem like days on end)\n\nWhat they started to medicate me with: \n\n\\-5 days of IV-IG around a month ago and I've been pretty good but I still have bad mood swings that I'm not proud of\n\n\\-a lot of cold/allergy medicine went a long way and kept everything else healthy while my brain was coming back to it's normal state (zyrtec and Flonase)\n\n\\-they gave me respiradone for the twitching but it didn't help at all so I stopped (5 mg for the day, 1 mg for night)\n\n\\-believe it or not since I was in such an impressionable state, any form of positive reinforcement helped me believe I would get through it and here I am\n\nWhatever is happening my parents are trying to figure out since I'm young so we can resolve this quickly because the doctors tried to sit them down to convince them it was conversion disorder (which I'm willing to accept if my physical symptoms would go away) but they don't think i'm making it up either. It was so bad they initially diagnosed me with autoimmune encephalitis (which came back from the mayo clinic negative) since i previously went to a rheumatologist and have the HLA B27 marker and had previous joint pain/stiffness before it flared up like this (mainly pain in my knees after leg day and stiffness in my hands from any sort of activity). I have been tested previously from Crohns and rheumatoid arthritis which luckily both came back negative. After I had the major flair up my entire body would feel like knives stabbing my legs and my head would have \"fuzziness\" that would run up and down it. I went into a doctor outside the cdc and she apparently said I have something called PANS and changed my diet so I wouldn't inflame and my stools have been decently consistent since then. I have just been told so much from so many different doctors i dont know what to believe anymore and I am scared of relapsing. Also mri said  \"Paranasal mucosal sinus disease\". Another weird symptom is that my left pupil used to be smaller than my right but now my right pupil is smaller than my left (my mom proved it to doctors via photo).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore anyone asks:\n\n\\-I have never done illegal drugs in my life before (socially drink every month sorry its college)\n\n\\-I dont hear voices (I confirmed this with doctors which is why they didnt label me as a schizophrenic and said conversion)\n\n\\-I've had memory issues before the incident but i was making good grades in college so i figured i was fine\n\n\\-up to date on vaccines \n\n\\-titer came back -2 (doubt anyone would ask about this)\n\n\\-I believe all cancer markers came back and I'm in the clear (dad had colon cancer so they checked my testicles since i told them i have erectile dysfunction and it will sometimes tingle but everything is clear down there as well)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/cmgbiSP](https://imgur.com/a/cmgbiSP) \n\nVarious test results that were taken within days of each other and some of the same tests come back with different results. I also took a wbc test before all this flared up and it was low but not low enough for the concern of my doctors.\n\nThere are various other tests i did not include which I can if need be but they came back relatively fine. If this is a mental thing i will gladly accept it and move on however i still have bad physical drawbacks like decreased cognitive ability (haven't drove in over a month), peripheral neuropathy (legs will even go numb as soon as i sit), extreme fatigue, and muscle weakness. If you have any questions feel free to ask. Thanks for any help and i just want suggestions for the doctors so they can help me sooner because living like this is miserable.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

My diet is not great and I don't eat a lot. I have never had a good appetite my entire life.\n\nSo today I woke up with a stomach ache, feeling nauseated. I could feel a lot of acid in my throat. I felt really sick and I felt like if I just threw up I would feel better, so the need was not extreme, but I did it anyway. It was extremely painful. It burned horribly and tasted terrible. I could still taste it when I breathed in afterwards. Like some kind of vaguely sweet but acrid taste. I brushed my teeth but somehow I feel like I can still taste it. My throat and chest still burn from it (but I don't think I breathed it in).

Happens every few years; I need to take medicine to get my weight back up when it drops too low) Idk if my current weight matters or not.\n\nalso the reason i mention the ham is because i'm not entirely sure the ham didn't help cause it, although i have no idea why it would", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I believe the type of hair loss they call it is diffuse thinning, where the hair was falling out of my head with no rhyme or reason all throughout the crown and was coming out many hairs at a time in the shower. Since that point I've had bald patches appearing all throughout my scalp and very thin hair on the top of my head. I've been to see a general doctor about this issue twice, and the first time I was prescribed prescription ketoconazole shampoo and was told I had what looked like suboherric dermatitis. I used the shampoo to middling results. The shampoo seemed to help the acne and \"scaly\" bumps that would appear on my head but not the bigger patches of inflammation that feel like they are under my skin and a constant bother, either itching or pulsating and hurting. I returned to the doctor after a month of being on that shampoo as it would only keep the acne away and that is about all it seemed to do for me. The doctor listened to my results and offered to set me up with a dermatologist referral and we spoke no more on the matter. The dermatologist that my doctor referred me to was scheduled for February as my general doctor didn't see my case as a medical \"emergency\" and that was the soonest available option.\n\nI come to reddit today for help because I'm quite concerned. My family has a history of keeping their hair and the sudden nature of losing the hair, patches of inflammed skin, acne, scaly bumps that sometimes ooze pus or just seem like excessive build up of gross stuff, and general uncomfort caused by the condition seem like something that should be time sensitive. I heard time can be of the essence with hair related matters and I feel like my doctor isn't taking me seriously, and the treatment I was prescribed didn't help all that much. I don't have many options available to me for doctors as I'm on state insurance with a limited amount of clinics I can go to (small town usa). If you have any advice I am all ears, please and thank you.\n\nIf I missed any details please feel free to ask and I can provide more pictures if needed.\n\nEDIT: I should also mention that this issue with my scalp has caused my lymph nodes in my neck to be hard to the touch and inflamed for the entire duration of this condition being with me.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

The soonest I can get in to see neuro is in January, and I\u2019m scheduled for an MRI for the end of March (again soonest I could get in....

I have an autoimmune disorder called Ankylosing Spondylitis that is essentially a kind of arthritis that affects my spine, if that\u2019s relevant. I don\u2019t take any meds currently (working on getting on Humira with my rheum).\u00a0\n\n\nI have been driving myself CRAZY with my inability to get anything done. Current excuse is distress over my recent diagnosis (see above), but honestly it\u2019s a problem that I\u2019ve had forever: I sit down to work on something. I open up the document. I type a sentence or two. Before I know it, I\u2019ve just spent an hour or two on google/youtube/reddit/video games (and yes, I have an eight page paper I\u2019m trying to get done, please don\u2019t ask how much progress I\u2019ve made, because the answer will disappoint you).\u00a0\n\n\nI CANNOT get anything done unless I can force myself to panic. I just can\u2019t maintain focus on stuff like school assignments for more than five minutes unless I\u2019m in an acute state of panic. If it can be put off, I can\u2019t do it.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not just schoolwork, either. I can\u2019t bring myself to be on time to *anything* except the most important of events, for which I usually arrive fifteen minutes early out of fear I\u2019ll be late. I\u2019m scatterbrained and disorganized. My room is always a mess and I can never find half the stuff I was holding in my hand not five minutes ago. I can\u2019t pay attention through a whole class period. I can get work done if it\u2019s due right away, but if it\u2019s due the next day I just can\u2019t keep focused on it, and usually just end up scrolling on my phone (or, when I was a kid, drawing/making up codes/writing stories).\u00a0\n\n\nAnd I mean, I can focus on some things. Chiefly, video games. I could sink six hours into Divinity: Original Sin 2 without even realizing where the time has gone. Programming too. I don\u2019t know, I just fall into a rhythm and it has the ability to keep my attention like nothing else.\n\n\nI always feel like time is slipping away from me. I\u2019ve been obsessed with the idea of being able to stop time since I was a kid. I never feel like I have enough time for anything, when in reality it probably takes me less time to do things than most people if I can just. sit. down. and. goddamn. focus.\u00a0\n\n\nI imagine what I\u2019m describing is just laziness, but god I\u2019ve driven myself into frustration that makes me want to bash my head into a wall just trying to sit down and write a paper. But the time just slips away from me, and I get angrier and angrier at my own impotence, haha.\n\n\nI can do things the night before they\u2019re due. Maybe starting in the late evening, and just drinking a bunch of coffee and pulling an all-nighter. I have to force myself to panic a bit before I can get anything done, and I\u2019ve tried unsuccessfully to make that panic happen before the due date, with no luck. Setting artificial due dates for myself doesn\u2019t work, because I know the stakes aren\u2019t really there.\u00a0\n\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do, but with my chronic pain the way it is, I really can\u2019t afford to keep doing this, and risk pushing things back and then being too incapacitated the night of the deadline to get anything done. I thought it was depression for a while (I was in a slump due to life circumstances), but now that I\u2019m certain I\u2019m not depressed, the ability to get things done hasn\u2019t magically come to me. Is this something a doctor could help me with? Chronic laziness? It\u2019s driving me mad. I know it\u2019s probably just bad habits, but it\u2019s making college really difficult for me, and I\u2019m not sure how to fix it.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I\u2019m 22, white, f, on the dot average height and weight for US, otherwise healthy except for severe chronic fatigue for which I take as needed stimulants. I drink on average about 1.5 gallons of water a day and pee (clear and plentiful) about 15 times a day (rarely wake up to pee at night but always get up from thirst). The only thing that\u2019s come up from tests is extremely low iron and B12 when I don\u2019t take daily supplements. I know it\u2019s not diabetes, in fact I\u2019m usually hypoglycemic plus I hate sweet things (I only like sour fruit) and I don\u2019t really eat the big starches like bread or potatoes. I eat balanced vegan, drink only water, and have moderate daily exercise. My old Dr thought my thirst was just an oral fixation to cope with my tiredness but I HAVE to drink at least a gallon of water spread out evenly throughout the day or I feel like I get a mild UTI.\n\nThese are the symptoms I have that make me think it\u2019s at least not entirely psychological: I don\u2019t really get sweat that drips anywhere but on my face and it\u2019s got to hit 90F before I\u2019m warm enough to wear shorts and a T outside. I have very dry (but still elastic) skin, I use the Cetaphil heavy cream as a daily facial moisturizer and my skin scales and cracks instantly in cold wind. If I don\u2019t drink enough right before bed, I wake up with an awful stomach knot that only water loosens. And if I go \\~6 hrs during the day without drinking water I start experiencing symptoms of a legit UTI; constant urge, produce a trickle at best, poor control, intense burning, intense thirst, distress. But after chugging a good couple glasses at once and getting back onto my normal intake rate, within \\~ 2 hrs I\u2019m feeling perfectly normal again. As a kid I would also secretly eat salt off a spoon bc I craved salt until I reached highschool and learned that was no longer a cool party trick. I once went to a checkup as a teen after purposely inducing the pseudo-UTI to show the Dr that I wasn\u2019t making it up and the urine sample came back miniscule but adequately hydrated\u2026 So idk what\u2019s going on there.\n\nIt\u2019s not that big of an issue lifestyle wise if I keep up with it, I just bring about a liter of water with me if I won\u2019t have an available source and account bathroom breaks into my travel plans. What made me curious enough to really look into it now is that a bit ago I had a real UTI during a head-cold and by the end in order to stop trickling + have up to 4 proper urinations, I had to drink at least TWO GALLONS OF WATER a day and I\u2019m confident that\u2019s not a commensurate input-output.\n\nAny ideas?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I have my next neurologist appointment Wednesday and I'm going to ask for an EEG.\nSo after my MRI was normal I noticed a lot of my symptoms died down, but I am left with constant muscle twitching and tremors. I have been twitching/tremoring since mid October, it started after Ivermectin usage (and stoppage). You can read my previous submissions to this reddit for more info. But recently, In the span of three weeks I had two significant bouts I can't describe. One was abrupt, I was walking and all of a sudden my legs got numb and I was shaking viciously. I felt faint and hungry, so I ate a variety of food (a sandwich, a brownie, and a frappe from Starbucks) and I felt better. I started thinking I could be hypoglycemic. The next one, which happened two days ago, came on voluntarily. I was looking for something in a grocery store, I couldn't find it so I asked a stock person where it is and he walked me to the isle and pointed where it is, but I still didn't see it. I kept looking in the aisles next to it, then ultimately I came back to the isle he pointed to and there was my item. That's when I felt me losing weight in my legs, like I was about to pass out. I got rapid shaking again but this time everything seemed unreal, like too close up or too far away in my vision. People seemed to leave a trace behind them as they walked, almost like a slo-mo video. I had to keep rubbing my fingers together until I got home. I was thinking during this bout that what if I had schizophrenia? And what if I started hallucinating? This put me into more panic like any second I could see something scary (I never did though and have never hallucinated in my life, minus when I'm sleeping, that's different story). \nI research every day what could be wrong with me. I mean I haven't skipped a day since it started. I look on my phone for things relating to my symptoms and find life-threatening diseases. I think that my MRI needs to be redone as maybe my ear piercing I couldn't take out could have affected my results or the neurologist didn't look at my results hard enough. I think that it could be anything (encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, schizophrenia) BEFORE anxiety. I've had five doctors tell me it's anxiety and some days I feel like they've given up on me and some days I think maybe they're right, but I'd rather do more testing to prove I'm completely healthy besides my mentality. \nThe truth is I don't think anxiety could cause such debilitating symptoms. I mean, don't a lot of people have it? How would they deal with this? It feels like my brain is deteriorating physically, not something mentally. Could anxiety cause chronic myoclonus and dystonia? If you think it's anxiety, do you think I have a severe type? Does it sound more like Generalized Anxiety, Panic Disorder, something else? Or do you think anxiety is only a symptom to something worse happening to me? Thanks for the opinions.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Last doctor visit in 2005 (to check on leg muscle). I do a fair amount of walking but I don't exercise beyond that.\n\nI have noticed for approximately seven months a slight ache in my left chest when I move in certain ways, although not every time I move in these ways. These ways include leaning to the right while turning to the right to throw something away in or to spit into a small garbage can to the right of my chair while sitting at my desk, similar movements of my trunk when standing (sometimes), and rolling over in bed. When leaning similarly in other directions, no ache is felt. The ache lasts only for the duration of the movement (while involved muscles are probably at their tightest) and then disappears. The location of the ache, to the best of my knowledge, is in the area of the costal cartilages to the left of the sternum, at a height slightly above or slightly below the bottom of the sternum. I don't believe I have felt any ache as high or as far over as the nipple. I have no tenderness when touching the costal cartilages, ribs, or the muscles between them with my fingers.\n\nMy belief is that my ache is related to muscles or nerves. Adding to my belief is the fact that, while never officially diagnosed with it by a doctor, I have occasionally experienced the pains of precordial catch syndrome most of my life. While most of my catches have completely gone away in two minutes or less, one time in 2005 I experienced a lingering mild ache that took approximately three months to completely go away. While my current ache did not come on with a precordial catch, I believe it's in the same general area.\n\nIt's possible I may feel quick, sharper pains on occasion, though I think this is more related to anxiety over the months-long issue (and some other anxiety in general). I've also become a bit hypersensitive in that sometimes if my shirt brushes my chest in a certain way, I incorrectly first think it has something to do with the chest ache.\n\nLast Wednesday (and more briefly today), I listened to my heartbeat with a cheap but functional stethoscope I once used as part of a Halloween costume (I was a veterinarian), and when comparing to YouTube and other videos, I did not detect anything obviously problematic (although I am obviously not a professional). On Wednesday I also took my blood pressure with a battery-operated household-grade monitor four times within 15 or so minutes, all on the left wrist while sitting as per instructions. One time I believe I held my hand incorrectly and looked at the screen while the monitoring was taking place, which I believe threw off the reading. The other three readings were 119/83, 118/80, and 112/87. I tried to remain as calm as possible when I monitored, though perhaps I wasn't fully. I sometimes think of myself as \"anxiously calm,\" in that I am both anxious and calm at the same time. Such as when having a dental procedure, I'm calm and cooperative yet can't help but still feel some nervousness inside.\n\nThank you for any help!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

It's a pretty general cycle at this point:\n\nAfter eating breakfast, usually bagel or omelette, often with some fruit - My heart races for like 1-2 hours afterwards but besides that there's few issues. If I eat at 8:30, I'm hungry by 12:15, which feels normal to me.\n\nAfter eating lunch, usually some type of sandwich/healthy entree and a salad - I won't have any problems immediately after eating, but after around 2 hours I feel on the brink of passing out due to hunger. I try to ignore it sometimes and hope it'll go away but when I do choose to snack...\n\nMid-afternoon snack, consistently 1/4 cup of trail mix, Cliff bar, or spoonful of peanut butter - I feel incredibly full and nauseous. I usually go to the gym after my snack and sometimes I feel like I can't exercise because I feel so sick and bloated.\n\nAfter eating dinner, usually a bigger meat-based entree, salad, and sometimes a bowl of quinoa/bowl of cereal - There are days like last night, when I only ate a sandwich and salad, and I have a dull queasiness in my chest and abdomen for hours on end. I had to lay down for over an hour to feel better, and even afterwards, still felt a numb discomfort in my torso area. I never have an urge to poop/throw up, just awful queasiness. Other days, like Sunday, I went crazy and ate my usual plus a plate of fries and two bowls of Raisin Bran. I can only compare it to the experience of being high...I felt like everything was wrong and I couldn't move without feeling absolutely terrible. It was an immense, paranoia-like experience. Most nights are somewhere less extreme, but still general discomfort.\n\nI don't know what's happening, given I exercise often and I feel like I have consistent meal times and sizes. I count calories and net 1700-2100 a day. I'm at the point where it's affecting my evening social life and I feel like I can't do anything because of the nausea.

I thought rest, ice and some rehab to strengthen my leg would do the trick. Seven years later, nothing has worked.

It is difficult to cross my left leg over my right leg.  When I stand, I favor my right leg and often put most my weight on my right leg. Calf muscle is *significantly* larger on my left leg. Left breast sternum is more pronounced, and sticks out further, than my right side's sternum. \n\nI've attached a picture where I've marked out the spots where I perceive the pain.

Since the day I discovered it the lump has been swollen enough I could feel it under the skin, and could move it around the area if pushing on it with two fingers (so gross).  It's always been squishy, like a tiny half-filled water balloon.  My parents took me to both my doctor and my dentist who determined - if I recall correctly - that it was a lymph node that just doesn't drain properly (it's situated in the area where the lower facial node is in the jaw on anatomy diagrams).  I also have a tear duct in my right eyelid that doesn't drain well either (discovered the same year) so we just goofed that I was \"lumpy\".  We were advised that there was no concern unless things changed.\n\nTonight - about 19 years after it was first discovered - I was putting face lotion on and discovered that the lump is hard, larger than normal, and a bit uncomfortable to the touch.  This is the first time I've ever noticed any change throughout the years.  When I grab my lower cheek area (think Great-Auntie Mabel squeezing your cheeks) I can clearly feel it in there amongst my face chub.\n\nI don't have corresponding lumpy areas on the right side, nor do I notice any others on the left.  It's fully under the skin so you can't see it in photos (hence the lack of them in this post).  No pain - just discomfort when palpated.

Fully vaccinated.\n\nI do have chronic acquired idiopathic urticaria (since age 20) but this does not feel at all like a flare.  Normally I'd be itching my face off, and the whole area would be swelling and red with a blanched centre (fluid accumulation) rather than it being limited to my \"little lima bean\" with no itch.\n\nI already have an appointment with my doctor on Thursday morning, conveniently.  It would be nice to have an idea or two of what is going on to share with him (we have a great relationship) and see what he thinks, though...

I woke up on Monday three weeks ago with some tightness in my chest, thought I probably had bronchitis, and scheduled a dr.appt with my new pcp. For some background, I got pertussis as a kid, and ever since, I get either pneumonia or bronchitis yearly, so it's not uncommon, and I generally don't get it as bad as everyone else (eg, I can function well, similar to a cold, just some crummy feeling and chest tightness, I've had pneumonia for over 2 months before going to a doctor before lol, no major issues). I also have severe grass/pollen/tree pollen (actually severe, gone into anaphylaxis twice before, always have an EpiPen), so I have near constant congestion. Again, not a big issue, just not normal for everyone. I've been like this for, well, basically forever, so half the time I can't tell if I'm sick, but if my chest feels tight, I go ahead and go to a doctor, as my allergies never cause that. I was also told that I have exercise induced asthma, but it only bothered me for a year after wooping cough and never again, never had an asthma attack, stayed active in contact sports, but aside from that first year 11 years ago, never had an issue catching my breath while doing sports (that was also the year I had pneumonia twice, once for 2 months, once for 3, basically half the year, so I'm not convinced it was actually asthma). I am on Alavert and Singular year round to control my allergies, in addition to carrying an EpiPen. I also live with a roommate who doesn't understand that if she's sick for 3 months and doesn't go to a doctor, imma get sick.\n\nAlright, sorry for the ridiculously long background, here's the issue. Roomate was sick, I woke up with chest tightness, similar to when I got acute bronchitis a few months ago, made an appointment for Wednesday. Had some issues walking up inclines on Monday and Tuesday, by Wednesday I was entirely out of breath by walking up a single flight of stairs. I'm not the most active person, but I typically walk between 25-35 miles per week, and stairs aren't an issue for me. Doc sees history of asthma, sees that I haven't had an inhaler for 11 years (whoops lol), gave me a steroid inhaler, rescue inhaler, sudafed. P flow test was 59%. Sudefed helped a ton with my congestion (some plants that I'm mega allergic to are blooming, so I do/did have extra congestion, not sure if it's from the plants or being sick). Inhalers did nothing. I did forget the steroid one twice (over a week and a half I think), but my condition continued to degrade rapidly. Rescue inhaler didn't help, I continued/continue to take it just in case, but it just makes me shaky and doesn't help me breathe better. After a week, I could no longer walk at a normal pace, I couldn't climb a flight of stairs without actually stopping and taking 3-4 breaks, and after two weeks, I had to take breathing breaks when I was just eating food and drinking water. Went back to the doc before the recommended two weeks, doc was surprised I wasn't better. Started talking about dust allergies, bronchitis, then out of left field, blood clots. She checked my legs and gave me tapered 20mg Prednisone. I am on bc, lowest dose out there, but it entirely stopped my cycle for 3 years. I also have a family history. Got freaked out, scheduled an appointment with pulmonologist the next week, she gave me a stronger steroid inhaler, agreed it could be blood clots, got a CT scan with contrast, but that came back fine. Also gave me a steroid injection and switched me to 10mg tapered Prednisone. Kept me on the same rescue inhaler.\n\n\nBeen on the new steroid inhaler for 8 days, and I've just gotten worse. I can't walk without getting out of breath at all, sitting down I'm out of breath, I just wake up out of breath and get more and more exhausted during the day. A 5 minute walk now takes 20 minutes, waking for 4-5 minutes takes me an hour to catch my breath, walking for 20 minutes leaves me exhausted for 3-4 hours. I can barely focus on anything, if I get out of breath in any capacity my legs and arms get weak like I've been working out, and they just stay like that the rest of the day.\nI have a follow-up with my pulmonologist in a week, but I'm out of town, and I'm barely managing to keep things together. Google isn't helping, so here I am. What are some likely things that are going on? Is it just asthma? I assume a tumor would have shown up on a CT scan, and I'm just at a loss. My chest still feels tight, initially it was just a tiny bit, not even uncomfortable, just noticeable, but now it's starting to ache.

I have chronic back lower back/buttock/hip pain for 3+ years.\n\nWhen I was 24 y/o I was diagnosed with mild facet joint arthritis and two Tarlov cysts (one is 1.5x1.1cm within the right S1 sacral foramina and the other is 0.7 x 0.5 cm sacral cyst along the midline posterior to the S2 segment). I went to the doctor for unremitting tailbone pain after a fall and offhandedly mentioned that my back and hips had been bothering me, as well. I knew that my back had been hurting before, but I thought that everyone experienced back pain, so I had ignored it until then. After seeing the Tarlov cysts on my MRI, my physiatrist sent me to a neurosurgeon for the larger cyst as he thought it might be the cause of my pain. The neurosurgeon told me to go to PT and to come back when I start shitting/pissing myself. He was so dismissive of it that I never really thought much about my cysts after that. I went to PT, which helped my tailbone pain, and just continued to suffer with back pain that has worsened over time.\n\nMy back pain is worse at the end of the day, worsens when I walk/stand for too long, worsens when I'm inactive for too long. It tends to peak in intensity towards the end of the day and I wake up throughout the night to shift positions to accommodate for it. The pain is not the same intensity 24/7, but I have periods when it feels more flared than other times.\n\nUltimately, I am at my wits end with the pain. It has begun to significantly interfere with things I enjoy (hiking, standing long enough to enjoy a metal show), and I am twenty-fucking-seven-years-old. So, I'm fed up. My primary agreed that this isn't normal and sent me for an updated MRI, which shows only very mild growth of the S1 cyst and no other changes. Prior to the updated MRI, I had seen information on non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis that felt eerily similar to my symptoms, but my MRIs show no sacral abnormalities beyond the cysts. I finally read more about Tarlov cysts since this last MRI and see that it could account for my symptoms, too. Then, I see there is risk for Tarvlov cysts to be comorbid with connective tissue disorders, so...\n\nAny advice on where to go from here? My primary has recommended that I go back to my physiatrist or the neurosurgeon again. I just want to make sure I head in the right direction.\n\nEdit: Forgot to add, I did another 4 weeks of PT prior to my latest MRI.

For several years I have noticed a relatively fast heart rate and recently I got a Fitbit and have been keeping a closer eye on it. Fitbit says my resting heart rate is around 65-75bpm (usually only this low while I\u2019m sleeping or just after waking up), this usually increases to around 85-100bpm when sitting, 95-115bpm while standing and 110-120bpm while walking. However, sometimes it will be around 80-105 when I\u2019m laying down resting and go up to 145 or even 165 when I stand up (but am not walking or exercising or anything). Readings from the Fitbit are confirmed accurate by a pulse oximeter I have and also by manually checking pulse. I don\u2019t really notice other symptoms when my heart rate is going this fast, other than being annoyed by the fast heart rate itself. My pulse usually feels regular but fast to me when I check it at these times. Triggers for this type of fast heart rate while just standing seem to be consuming alcohol (or the day after drinking) even if I only have around 5 or 6 alcoholic drinks, or possibly dehydration, though sometimes there\u2019s no obvious trigger at all. I have some general anxiety, which I\u2019ve learned to control better through daily meditation and treating my adhd properly, but I still have a fast heart rate, I\u2019m just not as anxious about it. This makes me think that the heart rate might not be anxiety related as I previously thought, especially considering I\u2019m not anxious at all after a few drinks but it still happens. About 3 or 4 years ago I went to the doctor and had a stress test, echocardiogram and wore a heart monitor for 48 hours. The results came back normal, however I didn\u2019t drink any alcohol during that time and on the days I wore the monitor my heart felt totally normal. I\u2019ve heard of POTS and think that I could possibly fit that diagnoses, in which case I\u2019ll just try to improve my cardiovascular fitness and not worry about it. I am just wondering if this type of occasional increase in heart rate can be considered normal (or at least not a cause for concern after a couple drinks, dehydration etc.) or if I should go back to the doctor. Is there any way I could have developed a new arrhythmia in the last few years or had one all along that wasn\u2019t picked up on the tests I had before? Would the stress test/echocardiogram/holter definitely have picked up any electrical problems with my heart? I take 30mg Vyvanse daily for adhd but I\u2019m quite sure that this medication isn\u2019t the cause of my tachycardia as I noticed it well before I started the meds and its just as likely to happen on days where I don\u2019t take it. \n\nTLDR; heart rate occasionally goes to 165bpm while simply standing up, a few alcoholic drinks or slight dehydration make this very likely to happen and easy for me to reproduce. Echo, stress test, holter all normal a few years ago. Is this reason enough to go back to the doctor and have my heart checked again or should I stop worrying about it and just try to improve my cardio and limit alcohol intake, hydrate and keep working on anxiety.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Was 70kg last time I weighed in but have been gaining weight alarmingly and not weighed recently.\n\nHere is a list of my ridiculously many symptoms:\n\n- Extreme cold intolerance\n   - Eyes water in the cold, sometimes can't see\n   - Feel very cold when others are too warm\n   - Feet often so painfully cold I can't move around\n   - Cold causes muscle pains which sometimes confine me to bed with electric heated blankets\n   - Lethargy, fatigue, hopelessness in winter months\n   - Sweating in the cold and getting even colder due to being damp\n   - Bad headaches when cold air gets in my ears\n   - Moving around in the cold causes very red itchy skin around the edges of my clothing \n   - Long history of this: was frequently reprimanded in school for wearing layers and coats indoors (against uniform code) \n   - my socks are always tangibly WET when I take them off from how much my feet sweat despite being PAINFULLY cold or numb\n\n- Photosensitive eyes causing watering eyes, sensation of burning in eyes, and bad headaches (sometimes crying at work from the pain of the overhead lights)\n\n- Constantly feeling absolutely exhausted, like just so bone tired I could collapse\n\n- Insomnia / delayed sleep phase. Fairly insensitive to light levels - I slept PERFECTLY when I stayed in California. Currently living in Scotland and my sleep schedule appears to be around 3am-11am. I have to be awake at 8am for work but it's still often hard to be sleepy before 2-3am.\n\n- History of insomnia since age 11. I regularly collapsed in school due to only getting 2-3 hours sleep a night as I had to wake up at 6am for school. At the worst of it I was awake for 3-4 days with no sleep on a semi regular basis. \n\n- Extreme confusion upon waking up, tiredly doing things that I don't remember, or not understanding danger (eg. woken up by a fire alarm - couldn't remember what it meant or how to evacuate so I just held my hands over my ears and cried) \n\n- Aching muscles, especially thighs/calves, only really helped by heat therapy (I use electric blankets). Was told these were growing pains as a child, but I have stopped growing since I was 16 and the pain still happens \n\n- Very easily 'triggered' muscle pain, eg carrying an EMPTY bag for 10 minutes causes acute stinging back pain between shoulder blades often lasting 1-2 hours. Still have pain from whiplash 7 years ago. Often get shooting pains in my thumbs and upper arms from writing or using my phone \n\n- Getting tired very quickly from walking /standing (can't think straight unless I sit down) \n\n- Difficulty concentrating and remembering what I'm supposed to be doing\n\n- Episodes of suddenly feeling faint, fast heartbeat and anxious\n\n- Gastrointestinal symptoms including constant nausea (sometimes too bad to eat), indigestion, heartburn, constipation, painful trapped wind, abdominal pain, taking 30 minutes or more in the bathroom to pass gas or stool\n\n- Managing gastrointestinal symptoms for the past 5 years with FODMAP diet (symptoms present for 8 years), but effectiveness has decreased as symptoms progressed\n\n- Nightmares and possible PTSD\n\n- Gender dysphoria\n\n- Itchy, bumpy, red dry skin around my armpits and upper arms (often flares up after showering or in the mornings) \n\n- Limited mobility in shoulders (can't raise arms fully above head) \n\n- Alarming weight gain, consistent with a family history of being thin and athletic until age of early 20s and then suddenly gaining weight (all my grandparents are horrifyingly obese) - despite the fact I am eating VERY little (due to the difficulty of finding/preparing FODMAP food when constantly too tired and cold to move) \n\n- Stretch marks that are painful, itchy, feel ridged when running fingers across them, and look way more horrifying than normal stretch marks (like I've been attacked and repeatedly stabbed on the inner thighs) \n\n- possible autism, auditory processing disorder and generally being overwhelmed by loud noises\n\n- Cripplingly painful periods with extreme PMS\n\n- my genitals are so painful to the touch that I cannot have intercourse (affects intimate relationships) \n\n- Long history of bladder difficulties. Did not stop wetting self/bed until late teen years. \n\n- Compulsively bite nails and fingers, leading to frequent infections &amp; swelling, and extreme jaw pain when I wake up\n\n- Grinding my teeth (gf has confirmed this as she can hear it when she's trying to sleep, but doctor hasn't diagnosed it yet) \n\n- Sharp stabbing pains in breasts, and very itchy nipples\n\n- Ears that can't equalize pressure, to the extent that not just flying is painful, but I can't even take trains that go through tunnels without special ear plugs\n\n- Sensitive skin; I can't easily carry groceries home because it hurts my fingers so badly (they go red, then white and hard to the touch and very painful, with visible lasting dents from bag handles) \n\n- Over active salivary gland (diagnosed by dentist) \n\n- Constant random tingling and itches in random parts of my body\n\nMy existing diagnosis is for ADHD and I take lisdexamphetamine daily. I also take norethisterone to prevent my periods. I have a history of vitamin D deficiency, loose kneecaps (dislocating kneecaps roughly fortnightly as a teenager but better now) and always completely losing my voice whenever I get a cold. \n\nFor context, drugs also affect me very weirdly. Stimulants makes me feel calm and sleepy - I drink caffeine to help me sleep, and one time I took another stimulant and immediately fell asleep. Even VERY small amounts of alcohol will make me EXTREMELY drunk - I don't drink often. The one time I had general anaesthetic it was the worst experience of my life, waking up felt like the worst parts of being awake for 4 days straight but magnified in every way. I do not smoke or use weed and don't intend to start. \n\nWe have explored PCOS and I had a positive ultrasound but a negative blood test.\n\nWhat could this possibly be? Do I have multiple auto immune disorders, or maybe a thyroid issue or a rare disease that makes the cold kill you?\n\nThanks so much for ANY suggestions. Even if it's just something I can take to my doctor and ask to test for.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I noticed them about 8 months ago, and I guess I sorta hoped they\u2019d eventually go away but they didn\u2019t. Finally was convinced by family to go to the doctor, and after explaining some of my other symptoms (occasional night sweats, inability to gain weight, itching at swollen lymph node sites, etc) he ordered a CT. \n\nJust had the CT done earlier this week, and of course my mind is racing.

I\u2019ve been left with a lot of questions. My main question to you, dear reddit, is what does a CT scan show? In this case, would it only show how enlarged the lymph nodes are, or is there something from this scan that can show if the lymph nodes are cancerous or benign? I know a PET scan can show cancerous cells, so I wasn\u2019t sure if a CT could do the same? Also, any clue as to why he wouldn\u2019t draw labs? What does it mean that they \u201cwouldn\u2019t tell him anything\u201d if they could show my white blood cell count or inflammation in my body? \n\nSorry for all the rambling questions.

No chronic health conditions.  \n\nOctober 2018 X-Ray on back was unremarkable; June 2019 MRI on back was mostly unremarkable, just age-related slight degeneration in cervical and thoracic vertebrae.\n\nIn mid-June I was experiencing stomach discomfort and a mild, gnawing pain that seemed tenuously connected to food (have had heartburn for a few years that is triggered by beer/soda, but my stomach has always been insensitive), as well as a painless cramp feeling in my lower left abdomen. Naturopath and doctor both suspected minor issues with gut biome/stomach acid, with a possibility of H. Pylori. I was prescribed a probiotic by my naturopath, and 45-day supply of Pantoprazole by my GP. I took the medication until mid to late August (at which time I was on holiday in Europe), and by then I had no stomach issues whatsoever. Upon returning to Vancouver, my problems seemed to have completely subside until about mid-October, where I would occasionally have the discomfort/pain after eating or drinking alcohol. It has occurred 1-2 times a week, as well as the weird cramp feeling. I went to the GP on November 22nd and explained my symptoms and concern that it was something more serious, as a November 16 scan for H. Pylori was negative (basic haemotology also normal), she gently dismissed larger concerns and suggested taking a 3-month supply of Pantoprazole before referral to a specialist. \n\nSince Sunday, I've had one or two bouts of mild stomach discomfort that seem to be food-related but not to any specific type food. In addition, I've had back pain that has mostly concentrated in the middle to lower area on the peripherals. I did stay at a friend's on Saturday night and slept on a much softer mattress than usual, and also carried a photography backpack for a short duration Saturday evening and Sunday morning.

She hallucinates these beings in her environment constantly and communicates with them verbally/physically. This, as well as frequent paranoia and delusions has led to a professional diagnosis of psychosis. She lacks the negative/disorganized symptoms for a schizophrenia diagnosis. She also has unrelated major depression and PTSD.\nHere\u2019s the \u2018kicker\u2019: these people/beings can front mentally in her body a la Dissociative Identity Disorder.

For as long as I have remembered I've always had sleep problems. One of these include hallucinations while dozing off to sleep and before waking up.\nThe first time I can remember experiencing this I was three years old. I woke up to a mini witch flying through my window. Another experience I had I was about 7/8, I woke up to spiders all over me. Recently these have gotten a lot worse, happening maybe once or twice a week. Usually I will see bugs/spiders upon waking. Truth is I can't tell if I'm awake yet or not, or somewhere in between. It doesn't make me jerk awake or anything. It seems like I just blink and it'll disappear. About a week ago I opened my eyes and saw a mosquito on top of my canopy net and actually tried killing it. Then I realized nothing was there. Last night I saw a spider right next to me making a web up towards my canopy, I watched it go up and then it disappeared. Along with this every night I fall asleep to weird sounds/images, that sometimes I can think of and it'll manifest into whatever I'm thinking. some other information: I sleep at least 10 hours a night, waking up often during the night and morning. I tend to also take a nap in the evening, and can still fall asleep at a regular time. I do not hallucinate during the day, it is limited to when I'm dozing off to sleep and sometimes when I wake up in the middle of the night. If I find myself unable to go back to sleep in the middle of the night I won't continue to hallucinate. It seems like it only happens when I'm half asleep. I have very vivid dreams and most of the time (I'd say about 85-90%) I know I'm dreaming, but I don't always control it. I kind of just roll with the dream. Any ideas?

As soon as I arrived at work I was extremely dizzy. I went home early that day and woke up in the middle of the night to use the restroom. I almost passed out from a head rush when I got out of bed, and by the time I got to the bathroom my heart was pounding extremely hard like I just got done running a mile. I laid back down and had pain in my chest. After a few minutes I was quite concerned and woke my partner up to take me to the ER. They ran blood tests, ekg, and x-rays and everything came up completely normal. \n\nFrom then on I continued to be dizzy all day everyday (even now I continue to be dizzy 24/7). After about 3 weeks from the ER visit I started getting headaches, sensitivity to light, pain in my tendons, sore muscles (after no exertion whatsoever), and worst of all extreme fatigue. After about 4-5 hours of being on my feet at work I would start to feel like I had the flu (sensitive skin, body aches, fogginess, temperature swings). Then by 5-6 hours of being on my feet I would feel absolutely exhausted, leg muscles on fire, and I would have to lay down and cover my eyes, and I couldn't physically do anything else, I could hardly even form sentences. I started seeing a primary care physician a few weeks after my initial ER visit. We ran multiple blood panels, tested for numerous virus's and other infections, sexual transmitted diseases, thyroid tests, and everything came up completely normal. No abnormalities in my blood whatsoever (I am happy to post the numbers if that helps). We also did further x-rays as well as a brain MRI. The MRI came up clean (as far as the pcp was concerned there were no lesions or tumors). I do however have a neurology appointment coming up this Wednesday. For about a week strait I also took my blood pressure multiple times per day and they all fell mostly into a normal range sometimes very slightly high. \n\nThe reason I am posting here is that this is severely disrupting my life, my relationships, my work, and so far we have not been able to figure anything out. I have about as much info now as when the first symptoms started. I am hoping that there is someone out there that might have some ideas as to what this could be. Please feel free to ask me any questions of specific tests that I have done, as well as any further information that I can provide so better help define symptoms. Thank you so much for your time and hope to hear from you soon.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

While taking the treatment it gave me horrid diarrhea I would say up to about 14 times a day mid treatment and got a little better as I got closer to finishing the pack. It made me ultra nauseous too which was weird because antibiotics didn\u2019t normally do that to me. The day I took the last pill I went to eat a normal meal and for whatever reason it felt like my food wasn\u2019t going down. It was sitting heavy for hours and making me feel like throwing up. It eventually did go down but it took 6 hours. From that day on everything I ate did the same thing. Then a new symptom emerged, I had the worst reflux I\u2019ve ever felt, no medication could touch it. I did nexium, protonix, omeprazole, pepto, and carafate. When the reflux started I became nauseous and had no appetite 24/7 and still have both symptoms to this day. I continued to work through this as a cna, and started dropping weight left and right. I got down to 109 lbs. I saw my Gastro doctor, he did blood tests for gluten which came back as less than 1, c reactive protein which came back as 0.5, IGA 56, and Sed rate 3. \nAt this time I started having diarrhea multiple times a day, and I was getting pain in my upper right quadrant. So I got sent for gallbladder testing, came back normal. I was in such distress and feeling so awful I had gone to the local ER a bunch of times where they would tell me I had keytones in my urine, and that I needed to see my Gastro again. For every appointment to see my Gastro doctor it\u2019s a 3 month wait. So as I\u2019m waiting one night I sip water and almost immediately feel like throwing up. I wait at the base of my toilet for 45 minutes before going back to the ER. I tell the doctor there what\u2019s been going on and he throws his arms up saying he doesn\u2019t know what to do with me. He angrily asked me if I wanted to be admitted and I said yes. So I got admitted. They ran tests and decided I most likely had a bad gallbladder, and took that out. \nI recovered from the surgery, feeling a little better and about a week later all my symptoms were back. Nausea, reflux, malaise, diarrhea. I waited it out a few months thinking my body needed to adjust. Then I made another appointment with my Gastro doctor. He was stumped and tried to chalk it up to IBS. He decided to do an endoscopy which came back normal, and then a colonoscopy with biopsy and stool study which was normal. Then he gave up, referring me to a university hospital. In the meantime my diet became diminished, things that were high in fiber, dairy, and fat made me feel even sicker when I ate them. Not to mention my anxiety started up something terrible. I was put on several antidepressants but all made me feel worse.\nThen came the university Gastro doctor. She listened to what I had to say, put me on remeron because it\u2019s been shown to help digestion, scheduled an emptying scan and another endoscopy. All tests came up normal. The remeron helped only slightly with digestion and anxiety so I stopped taking that. This Gastro at my last appointment said she thought I needed counseling and that\u2019s why I\u2019m sick. So I\u2019m stuck.  I\u2019ve been able to put on weight, and eat more of a variety but I\u2019m still struggling with constant nausea, reflux, diarrhea, lack of appetite, I catch every virus in a 10 mile radius, I feel weak, and sick 24/7. I\u2019m not sure what to do next, it seems every doctor I talk to tells me it\u2019s anxiety but I\u2019m really sick all the time to the point where it hinders my quality of life greatly. I had my pcp check my thyroid which was normal, my wbc count was low at 4, my ferritin level was 7 but my iron was at 255 and that\u2019s about all the testing I\u2019ve had done. Any insight would be appreciated.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Glasses correct the blurriness, but this is simply because they are correcting for the distorted lens.\n\nI think the distorted lens is due to pressure on my eyes.

I have had utis my whole life, so do the females in my family, but this has been the most. 12 in one year. I also had high blood pressure starting around the same time. I am on medication for it which has brought it down to normal. My doctors first thought was kidney problems or diabetes but all my complete blood work, thyroid screens, plus multiple ultra sounds show I have healthy kidneys apart from a few small ulcers. The blood flow is normal too. I also have one small complex cyst on ovaries but its thought to be from menstruation. I still have blood and protien showing up in my urine under a microscope. I'm seeing a urologist who did a urine test for cancer cells but came back negative and now doing weekly urine tests to monitor blood levels. I'm also scheduled for an xray to check for kidney stones. Everytime I have had a uti it has tested positive for an infection. I live in the usa so even with good insurance, its taken a year to get to this point with the time it takes to get appointmets etc. The only major health problem i have had in the past was hypersensitivity vasculitis when i was 19.

They have been dry coughing constantly starting within a few hours of going to bed. Sometimes it is fairly immediate (like at nap time) and others after a few hours (at bedtime). It is accompanied by a slight or sometimes dramatic wheeze, which I assume comes after the cough. It is enough to keep at least one of them up (and my wife and I as well) and they describe that their tummy hurts and are going to throw up (which only happened once during the night). This started in about July of this year right after their annual checkup turning 3. \n\nAt that point they had a very wet cough throughout the day and would last about 3 weeks and would disappear for about 1 week. Dr has had them on albuterol and budesonide nebulized since then. They have not been diagnosed with anything yet. We are seeing a pulmonologist soon but it took 6 months to get an appointment (it was 9 and then it got pushed up)\n\nThe wet cough went away about a month ago and dr has had them on singular granules for a little over a week. She basically said she is out of ideas of it doesn\u2019t help and will be up to the pulmonologist at that point. I am not sure how long the singular takes to work. \n\nAt this point they are coughing considerably less during the day, but nothing has changed at night. What concerns me is when they say something hurts like their back or tummy. I am inclined to believe them but they are toddlers after all. Dr writes it off as part of the constant coughing. \n\nThey are about 3\u20193\u201d and 36 pounds, mixed race (white/black/Mexican) and we live in California\n\nHoping there is something we can do besides just wait for the pulmonologist, or understand better what we are dealing with. \n\nThank you.\n\nEdit: I should mention my wife and I had really bad asthma growing up so we have always taken allergy precautions especially when the boys were born. No carpets, careful with detergents and scents (I have problems with those) etc. We do have pets but the boys don\u2019t have any issues in the family room where we all spend a lot of time including the dog and cat. The animals have never been in their room.  They tested for cat and pollen allergy but it was very low.

I did go to a doctor for this. Did CT with contrast of lower abdomen and pelvis, Urine test, and Lower Abdomen Ultrasound.\n\nOn Sunday, I urinated totally fine.  But 30 Minutes later I had sex and noticed there was some blood in my ejaculate. I looked down and the tip of my penis had blood on it and I was bleeding. I cleaned it off with about 3 toilet paper squares and was mostly just scared for a while. Then 1 hour later I went to urinate and it was the most painful experience of my entire life. I was screaming in pain and the pain was so extreme I felt like I could vomit. There was blood in my urine. I went to the doctor and gave urine sample which also still had a bit of blood. For the next 5 times I went to urinate there would be about a half second of blood at the start or end of the stream. It hurt to pee, but it was no longer 10/10 pain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday and Tuesday,  I went to the urologist and did lots of tests everything was clean save for this passage in the CT.  It did not hurt to pee anymore but I also had not gotten anymore erections. I did not see blood in my pee anymore\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWednesday- I woke up with morning wood but the tip of my penis was hurting a bunch. It was hurting basically at the base of the tip (like the mushroom head on the underside). Wednesday was my Urologist follow up. Everything normal but CT said:\n\n\" Prostate is normal in size. A subcentimeter curvilinear right periprostatic calcification may be vascular in etiology\" - What does this mean?\n\nThe doctor gave me doxycycline hyclate and said take it twice a day. Said that something in my prostate was clogging glands and when this happens there is problems like I experienced.  Didn't think I would die and also didnt think I got hurt during sex.  Said my morning pain from erection was because of the prostate swelling up and there still being problems and to not panic but take the drugs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Facebook, My nurse friend said she felt that maybe one of the calcium nodules broke during sex, this lead to the bleeding and having to urinate that out caused a ton of pain and inflammation.

I thought it was a slight nerve issue and ignored it. On November 4th I woke up from sleeping on my couch and my entire right side felt weak and numb.

One of my friends took me to the ER and they did a CT scan and told me that it didnt seem like a stroke and they gave me some medication for abdominal pain.\n\nI felt a little better thinking I had slept wrong or something(I sleep at a bad angle on my couch all the time.) Five days later I woke up and noticed that the heat from my heater felt hotter on one leg than the other. I started freaking out and decided to go back to the ER. They gave me a full CT scan and then a brain MRI. They couldnt find anything but told me to follow up with my doctor.\n\nBoth times I was at the ER I noticed my blood test levels were all borderline anemic. They seemed to brush it off. I week and a half later I went to my doctor and he did some quick relflex testing and said I might have a pinched nerve further up my neck that would cause an issue like this. I had already gotten on WebMD so I just kept my mouth shut and let him start ruling out things.\n\nBecause of money I had to wait a week to get some xrays on my spine.

Ends with description of the pain and important info.\n \nI've been having issues with my wrist for the last year and a half. It started from me scooping ice cream in the deli where I work to much. I was originally diagnosed with de quervain's tendonitis. I went to physical therapy (but had a super incompetent therapist who had never worked on wrists before) and after like 5 months we figure out what worked for my wrist and I started to get better. After this he got a new job and I was transferred to another therapist who also wasn't familiar with wrists and at this point I stopped seeking treatment because my wrist was feeling better enough to go back to work full time. \n\nDuring this time my pain was mostly around the thumb and the forearm, but generally the whole wrist would ache. Also, I wore a wrist brace nearly 24/7 at the beginning of treatment and still at work towards the end of treatment. \n\nOnce the busy season for my job kicked in again (April and May at my job) my wrist pain started coming back until mid May when it hurt so bad I was sure my wrist was completely reinjured. This time however my pain is mostly centered on the pinky side of my wrist, while occasionally being the whole wrist and the forearm. I saw my Dr again and we decided to just try physical therapy again, only this time with hand and wrist specialists. After after 5 months of physical therapy and little to no improvement we decided to take an MRI of it. The MRI showed that my TFCC was a little inflamed and had some scar tissue indicating a previous tear. They said my tendons looked fine. They tried giving me a cortisone shot. The first 3 days I thought it was working and hurting less but then it went back to hurting if not hurting more now. A month after getting the shot my Dr tells me he has no more ideas and I should get a second opinion and see if surgery is a good option. Last week I saw the doctor they referred me to for a second opinion and he said that he couldn't think of a reason why my wrist is experiencing pain still but that he thinks surgery would not help at all because my TFCC was only a little inflamed and my tendons didn't look bad. I'm just at the point where I don't know what to do anymore. I'm working reduced hours at work because the longer I work the more likely and worse my wrist will hurt. \n\nMore descriptions of my pain and important info: my wrist doesn't seem to hurt while doing an activity but usually like 10 minutes after, unless it's already irritated. Every time a doctor moves my wrist and asks if that hurt the answer is usually no. But then 10-20 minutes later after the appointment my wrist gets sore and achey. Sometimes my wrist pops in the same spot on the pink side of my wrist with circular movement, but not often. Pain can vary between mild discomfort and a constant ache to where any use of it hurts more. My wrist is also very weak and get tired easily, especially when holding it up, but this might be from the lowered activity over the past year. I'm still working at the same job where I was injured but limited hours and limited activities. I wear a wrist brace when I work and when I forget it at home my wrist hurts very much and much more easily. \n\nSince it was a work related injury it's an L&amp;I case but I'm very worried L&amp;I will close it because the doctors don't know where my pain is coming from. Really need to figure out what's wrong with my wrist and fix it.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Doctors have stopped taking me seriously.", "author": "daimaiall", "self_text": "I know this is long but I am desperate for any insight. I tried to include any and every detail. Thank you in advance. \n\n24 yr old Caucasian female, 5'6\" 128ish lbs. Born and raised in upstate NY, living in Colorado for 3 years at roughly 8,000ft elevation (potentially relevant). \n\nJanuary 2018: suddenly had abdominal pain and mild symptoms of UTI (frequency, urgency, pain if I didn't relieve myself asap) was treated with antibiotics and everything seemed fine \n\nA few months later same thing happens. Same symptoms same treatment. Life goes on. \n\nOctober 2018: UTI symptoms again but worse, accompanied by cold symptoms. On halloween I am feeling like absolute hell. Fever, extreme fatigue, so much abdominal pain, urinating every 30 minutes. Overall very sick. Get treated for a UTI again and told I probably also have some sort of virus going around. For the remainder of the year I never end up feeling back to 100%. Extreme fatigue, bladder issues persist with incontinence and abdominal pain. Loss of appetite and weight loss of about 10lbs. \n\nJanuary 2019: I faint out of nowhere (was doing nothing out of the norm that day) totally unconscious and didn't come to for several minutes. The next several days afterward I have bloody bowel movements. Go to my doctor and in the months that follow I have \n\nAll the usual blood work (normal)\nUltrasound of kidneys, Bladder, uterus, and ovaries (normal) \nColonoscopy (normal)  \n\nI see a hematologist and gastro specialist. Hematologist doesn't think its a blood issue and gastro chalks blood in stool up to IBS with constipation. \n\nOver the spring and summer of 2019: all of the above symptoms get worse along with many alarming new ones. I have extreme difficulty with bladder control. Constant abdominal pain and upset stomach with frequent blood in stool, both constipation and diarrhea (I cannot remember the last time I had a normal bowel movement), extreme fatigue, frequent migraines with and without aura, dizziness, numbness and weakness on only the right side of my body, nerve pain in my right hand and foot, chest pain, and ocassional shortness of breath. \n\nSummer and Fall 2019: I have a few terrifying episodes where I feel like no matter what I do I cannot get enough air. Get a headache, start to act confused, struggle to hold my head up and keep eyes open, slur my speech. No matter what I do to take slow controlled deep breaths it does not help. Think maybe I'm having a panic attack and stay calm, breathe normally, does not help. (Note that I have had anxiety/ panic atticks in the past and this felt nothing like that. None of the techniques I use for panic attacks helped.) I have also noticed that climbing in elevation can make me feel worse and dropping in elevation (down to at least 3-4 thousand ft or lower) seems to alleviate some symptoms. \n\nI have a chest x-ray and pulminary function test which are normal although the pulminary funtions test felt extremely difficult to perform and made me feel faint. \n\nI see a neurologist who determines that all of my reflexes on the right side are \"jumpy and abnormal\" and that I also have a lack of sensation on the right side. He rules out MS and many other neuro conditions with a brain and c spine MRI and a lumbar puncture that are all normal. Then I see a cardiologist who orders a stress test that shows my oxygen levels drop into the 80s when my heart rate increases. He orders a transesophgeal echo that shows I have a PFO yet he does not think it is significant enough to be the cause of my symptoms and suggests I see a lung specialist. \n\nI also get a finger oxygen monitor and start paying attention to my own oxygen levels. They drop when I walk around quickly or jump up and down and then come back up into the 90s after a few minutes.  \n\nI saw the lung specialist today who listened to all of my symptoms. Listened to my lungs and then told me that all of my symptoms are a result of psychological stress that I am not dealing with. He told me I should excersice more and see a therapist. This is not the first time I have gotten the psychosomatic response from a physician and although it feels like a cop out \"I don't know whats wrong with you\" diagnosis, I never discount it as a contributing factor. During all this time I have focused on keeping stress and anxiety under control, seen a counselor, tried to remain active and do the things that make me happy and yet I do not feel any better, only worse. I just feel deep in my gut that something else is going on and it is not all from stress. It is also important to note that before october of 2018 I felt healthier and in the best shape I ever have in my life. I was running up to 7 miles 4-5 times a week along with other forms of excersice. \n\nI have also been tested for lyme disease several times with the western blot and they were all negative. I have yet to find an infectious disease specialist in Colorado who will see me because of this. \n\nI am at the end of my rope and really cannot stand to feel like this any longer. All forms of physical exertion make me feel awful and I cannot currently partake in my greatest passion, which is art, because of the nerve pain, weakness, and numbness in my right hand/arm. I feel like my life is completely on hold.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I have been dealing with drenching night sweats for about 5 years. However, they don\u2019t occur year round. For whatever reason, they seem to start up during the winter and taper off once the weather gets warmer. I might have a week of night sweats randomly during the \u201coff season\u201d. When in full swing, I will wake up about every hour drenched in sweat until the morning. This year, they actually started up in the summer and have lasted almost nightly until now. They are extremely debilitating and I am always exhausted. I have no nightmares and I do not snore.\n\nI also always feel fatigued. I was diagnosed with Hashimotos last year and I thought that starting thyroid hormones would alleviate this. However, I have felt no difference in my Hashimotos symptoms (fatigue, brain fog, cold sensitivity) since starting medication. My thyroid levels are currently normal save for my thyroid peroxidase (currently 238, down from 1080 before treatment). The night sweats were present before I started taking hormones anyway. My iron was also low, so I started taking a supplement. These levels are now normal as well. \n\nMy lymph nodes on my neck and groin are also mildly swollen. They have been this way for years, and the general consensus is that it\u2019s nothing to worry about.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve had done:\nTB test\nThyroid ultrasound\nChest x-ray\nSPEP panel\nCBC\nIodine levels\n\nAll of these tests have come back normal, save the thyroid ultrasound which shows that I have a swollen thyroid (surprise surprise) and a nodule on a lymph node near my thyroid.

Ethnicity/Race: Ashkenazi Jewish and East Asian. Blood pressure between 90/55 and 120/80, usually about 105/75. No medications.\n\nA month ago, I took over-the-counter diuretics (50mg of Pamabrom in each pill) for several days to help with fluid retention around my jaw and hands that doctors have yet to figure out (many have claimed to not even notice it, but the diuretics did help and I\u2019m going to be evaluated for TMJ disorder soon), following instructions on the package (although I broke a pill in half at one point), and have been feeling my heart racing and pounding almost everyday ever since. I'm still experiencing all this even 1 month after I stopped taking the diuretics. I can feel my heart pound even when my resting heart rate is in the 70s, but it feels even worse when it is 80bpm or above. It gets above 100bpm, as well. With the palpitations also comes with feeling very weak and like I could faint. Eating foods with potassium in it may make it worse, or just eating food in general. Sometimes drinking water somewhat helps, but it still happens even when I'm already drinking a lot of water (at least 80 ounces a day). No chest pain, headaches, or nausea. There have been a few days when I mostly felt fine (including the one day that I wore the holter monitor). But most days, when I am experiencing these symptoms, they are on and off for several hours at a time.\n\nAlso, a few days ago I\u2019ve started to notice that my heart and other parts of my chest kinda sort of hurt for 1-3 seconds at a time no more than a few times a day. It\u2019s hard to describe the pain.\n\nI saw cardiologists, who had me do wear an event monitor then a holter monitor. With both monitors, except for one time when my heart rate went past 130bpm and went up to 154 bpm (both of which I did not feel myself), they say that my heart rate/rhythm was within normal limits. I also had blood tests done to test my electrolytes, thyroid stimulating hormone, glucose, Vitamin B12, complete blood count, and they all came back normal (mean corpuscular hemoglobin was a little higher than normal). The blood tests I\u2019ve done were labeled \u201cCMP/TSH serum or plasma\u201d and \u201cCBC, w/ Auto diff.\u201d I also did an echocardiogram where they found no abnormalities. This is not due to anything anxiety related, either. These symptoms start even when I have been feeling calm. I do have history of a heart murmur, which I still have.\n\nI was prescibed beta-blockers (2.5 mg bisoprolol) to take as needed. However, I took one dose 5 days ago and the next day, and for the few days after, I felt very dizzy and even weaker. Those feelings got worse when I tried to lie down to sleep at night. I also had this feeling in my legs as if I have sat on them for too long even though I did not sit on them at all. These reactions to the beta-blockers seem to be wearing off, though.\n\nThe doctors are not finding anything wrong with me, and they say that it is nothing life-threatening, but I can't function.

We have no idea how to make things better for him at this point.\n\nHe has idiopathic peripheral neuropathy (I believe small fiber), plus interstitial cystitis. He has been seen by multiple doctors and has had lots of tests done. He's even tried like shock treatment, Acupuncture, Epsom salt baths, cannabis, and other holistic medicines.\n\nThey can't seem to figure out what has caused it. He did take a medicine for a misdiagnosed prostate infection that he originally believed could've caused it, Cipro. But I believe that was ruled out by now. He also had a spinal-tap. That confirmed he had lots of g5 I believe in his system, much more than the average.\n\nHe was also tested for Lyme disease. It was negative, but I heard those can come back negative when retests can come back as positive.\n\nThe burning and tingling of nerve damage has passed his feet and hands up into his face and is even affecting his heart. Lately, he's been bedridden and is suffering from multiple muscle spasms and twitching throughout his body, but mostly his face.\n\nHe's on the highest dose of Gabapentin and probably 8 other medications if not more. However, the main source of his treatment is something that costs $20-40,000 a month, IVIG (Immunoglobulin therapy) where a nurse administers this through an IV once every week or two.\n\nAlthough the IVIG makes him sick, especially in the beginning, it seemed to help a lot. However, it doesn't seem to do as much anymore. It takes his pain down from a 10 to a 2-3 but only for a day or two. It seems very random and arbitrary whether or not he'll have a \"good\" day where he feels okay.\n\nIt's been tough to say the least watching my brother slowly lose his life with a disease that just seems to get progressively worse. I don't know if I'd be able to continue on without him. I don't know what can be done at this point.\n\nSorry for the long post, and thanks for reading.\n\n**TLDR:** Brother has some type of neuropathy, has tried lots of 'treatments', don't know what to do at this point.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

The only medication I am on is birth control pills and have been on the same kind for 4 years with no side effects that I know of.\n\n5 days ago, I was studying for exams in my room and felt a pain in my hand - I didn\u2019t think it was unusual as I was obviously writing constantly and thought I just needed a break. Then I started getting random tension or dull aches in my forearms, knees and shins (only one spot at a time and would come for only a few seconds at a time then go away). The best way I can describe the feeling in the knees is that it\u2019s like after a leg workout when you have tension in your knees and you kind of have to extend and flex your leg until it \u201ccracks\u201d or loosens the tension?  I should note that none of it has been painful, moreso just annoying. As a respiratory therapy student, my very first thought was Guillain Barr\u00e9, however my symptoms have not been progressive and I\u2019ve had no motor function issues - no difficulty walking or balancing; in fact, the feelings seem to be pretty much nonexistent when I AM walking around, even for long periods of time. The sensations are worst when I am sitting still for long periods, but they are much better when I lie down at night to go to sleep. My next thought was a blood clot since I know BC can cause them, but I have no redness or physical signs of one. \n\nThe only possible things that have changed that could have triggered something is that I was using Abreva on the day the signs started (thought I had a cold sore but I don\u2019t think it is). But I looked up the side effects of it and don\u2019t think it would cause anything like this. The other is that I had my flu shot last week and my TB skin test a couple days before that, so maybe my immune system got overwhelmed and it caused an excessive inflammatory response. The other thing I thought of was that it could be anxiety - I have anxiety and I just had 10 exams in 14 days and have been incredibly stresses and not taking care of myself very well. once I noticed the first feeling in my hand I could have been hyperfocused on every little thing and there may be nothing there at all. I have no other symptoms other than this muscle tightness - no dizziness, fatigue, inability to feel my limbs, problems walking, etc. I am currently visiting a friend in Calgary but I will either be going to Emerg when I get home to Ontario in a couple days or just making appointment to see my GP (I\u2019m not sure it would be appropriate to go to the ER since I am functioning and not in pain).\n\nIf anyone has any advice in the meantime I would greatly appreciate any opinions!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Fast forward about a week later my doctor prescribed me beta blockers. Took a few with no effect, But I feel like I didn't give it enough of a chance. A week later I began on anti depressants for anxiety (50mg), I took these for less then month, they worked well enough, I got serotonin syndrome, I missed my dose and took one a few days later as I didn't have the mediation and took it a few days later. Serotonin syndrome was one of the worst things I've ever gone through. It put me off anti-depressants.\n\nI almost felt recovered. A few weeks later, after moving to a new house, my heart would not stop excessively beating, I mean it would be like a Ferrari engine. Just going up and down in speed. During this period I didn't eat / sleep for a few days. I was extremely stressed, a bit paranoid and hyper aware also due to huge amount of stress on both my body and  my mind. Parts of my OCD started to act up.  I went to the doctor but they couldn't find anything wrong. But what would happen is that I would be on constant fight or flight adrenaline mode. Eventually this subsided for about two days when I moved house.\n\nI was living with a parent, in process of moving to another place. I wasn't too stressed. I had some OCD, but the heart condition came back with full force. I mean I would wake up at about 4am, maybe to struggle for an hour then I have to walk for a few hours while my heart is on full on adrenaline mode. Then after a few hours I would crash right the hell out. Eventually I started to take b vitamins, some inositol, the b vitamins felt like they helped allot. Later on I started to take magnesium.\n\nSo anyway, a month from living with my father i'm living with my girlfriend. We just went to the emergency room today. Same thing. I had a stressful night with a flat mate. I woke up with exploding head syndrome. And bam adrenaline was just coursing through my body. Did not stop and its my second day now. I haven't really slept. I feel a tingling sensation on the end of my fingers. I have zero desire to eat anything like I mean I want to eat for the sake of eating but absolutely zero appetite. When I try to get to sleep my heart either decides to rev up like an engine or the exploding head syndrome jolts me to wake up. I've heard that thyroid issues can play a role here. I'm planning a call with a doctor tomorrow and then to get an appointment in but its been really difficult for me. The doctor today couldn't figure it out either, he did an ecg and no blood tests but everything appeared as normal, he asked me 'what do you want from this' when I had told him what had happened. He nearly wound up giving me Valium. But we settled on beta blockers (10mg). I've take two so far with little effect. Nearly passed out today from the exhaustion and my heart racing, felt like the floor was moving and felt really faint. I feel extremely tired. I don't smoke or drink alcohol. I understand if I woke up with a racing heart once in the middle of the heart due to stress but it almost feels like there's an issue with the amount of adrenaline being pumped into my body. Like huge amounts. Like the reaction is way out of proportion.\n\nPlease let me know if you guys have any idea.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I don\u2019t know if these are related at all, but I thought I should mention it. I have not had this happen since. \n\nThen, a few months later, the first thing happened again.

I had some typical symptoms of food poisoning like vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. After that in the same week, I started noticing some swollen pink spots all over my limbs (both arms and legs). They were not painful unless poked (a somewhat hard poke was required so they weren't very sensitive) and even if it hurt, it felt like a tiny bruise. Days after these appeared, i began getting constant fevers every day. This went on for months. In the following February (2016), i was admitted to the hospital for a blood clot in my leg. Doctors assumed it was caused by laying around too much since I constantly felt bad. My primary doctor ran a TON of tests and everything came back negative. The spots and the full-body fevers finally subsided after 6 months.\n\n1st quarter of the following year (2017), these spots start coming back. Knowing where this is going, my doctor sends me to a dermatologist who determined via biopsy that I had erythema nodosum. She sent me to a rheumatologist who confirmed that this was the case and he prescribed me 200 mg of azathioprine daily. My nodules (spots) went away before the medication really got in my system so I stopped taking it. Christmas time of 2017 rolls around and I deal with another flare up but my dumb self rides it out for months because the azathioprine made me nauseated and I was working an office job anyway at the time so I could deal with it. Fall of 2018 and I get another flare up. This time, it's both the Erythema nodosum and now my mouth is getting some type of autoimmune issue that causes my gums to act like I have periodontitis when I don't. I'm prescribed dexamethasone and my doctor insists on me going back on my azathioprine which I've listened to from here on.\n\nAll of this brings me to now.\n\nI've been on the azathioprine for a year. For the most part, it helps with the fevers (but not 100%). It keeps the nodules from covering my entire body but doesn't stop them from forming all together. Now when they form, some of them get so big that they crack open and scab and I have large scars all over my body just from a year of this. My rheumatologist is very difficult to get in to see and there aren't any others very close to me (I've been on a waiting list to go back for several months).\n\nPoint I'm getting at: my doctor diagnosed me with undifferentiated connective tissue disorder and I feel like that's a cop-out diagnosis for when he doesn't have another answer. Erythema nodosum is typically not chronic and is already a fairly rare condition. Resources online for chronic erythema nodosum is almost non-existent and I haven't found anything where it causes mouth issues either.\n\nHas anyone ever heard of anything similar to what I have? If so, do you have any idea of a medication or treatment that's helped better than azathioprine?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I will try to put as much detail as possible from what I have been given by her from her account of this problem.\n\nAge: 29\n\nSex: F\n\nWeight: Approx 140\n\nRace: Caucasian\n\nSmoking/Drugs/Alcohol: Does not smoke or take any prescribed drugs, occasionally (est. once a week) drinks alcohol\n\nBackground information: Has not been officially diagnosed, but has a history of Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome normally triggered by heat. Random muscle spasms throughout lifetime, but recently for the past year painful ones in the neck have been occuring. She has undergone physical therapy for her right knee, but since about age 16 her hips and lower back have been painful. Works a demanding job that requires long periods of standing, but she frequently has to sit down due to the constant aching pain in her right hip.\n\nMain Issue: About 2 years ago she started having rare intermittent partial numbness of her right buttock. After standing it would feel like it had fallen asleep but not entirely. She assumed possible damage to her sciatic nerve. This past August, her right ovary frequently has cysts that rupture about once a month, and while at work one of them ruptured, she noticed numbness and tingling down her right leg about 20 minutes after this occurred. She assumes she has just been standing too long, but it does not go away for hours. She has a family history of blood clots forming in the right iliac arteries and goes to the ER to have the problem checked. ER asks her to wait 2+ hours and during this wait her right inner thigh becomes increasingly uncomfortable, is ok when she stands but still tingling sensation.\n\nAfter being admitted to the ER, doctors check the pulses in her leg (results normal) and they do the sharp/blunt test and she is able to feel everything. Doctors say it is a pinched nerve and she voices her concern about the cyst rupturing (which no doctors have listened to her concerns for 5 years prior to this) and she finally gets them to do and ultrasound. She was found to have a UTI (only started in 2017 and since has had \\~10) and they find the cyst is hemorrhagic and is about 3cm. After this, they sent her home with NSAID and antibiotic script even though she expressed her concern that NSAIDs make her very sick to her stomach. After this the tingling still persists for several days until she has an allergic reaction to the antibiotics.\n\nShe ends up with severe hives and went into a CVS episode while at work. She managed to take some benadryl to help counteract the reaction, but after this the tingling proceeded to spread to her right arm and right side of her face.\n\nAfter a week she went to a GP who sent her to a neurologist when she was tested for lupus (negative), optic neuritis (negative), thyroid issues (normal), vitamin B deficiencies (all normal), Aquaporin-4 Ab ELISA (negative), and myelin Ab (abnormal). She also had an MRI with contrast done on her brain, orbits, cervical, and lumbar, all coming back completely normal. She has no disk compression or foramen stenosis to explain the leg issues, and the neurologist is at a loss. She was sent to a endovascular doctor, who did not seem interested in her background or the whole story, only checked her pulses and said she was fine. Just to be safe and she has an EMG scheduled in January.\n\nCurrently the pain in her inner thigh is only when she tries to stretch, which is effecting her ability to do some of her hobbies like dancing, but this past weekend it has been more persistent. The numbness and tingling have also been progressively getting worse and has spread to her entire right side, and for the past month she has been experiencing dizzy spells while standing, which is beginning to effect her job. If she turns too quickly she feels like she is going to pass out. She cannot drive long distances (less than an hour) or her foot will go numb, she cannot walk her dog, dance, crochet, or play video games for the same reasons.\n\nHer doctors do not suspect MS because of the negative MRI, but at this point she is desperate for answers and suggestions, and I am here because at this point we are looking for any kind of suggestions. So please, Doctors of Reddit, have you seen something like this? Can you help? I will try to reply to any comments with amplifying information if it is needed but my responses may be delayed since I am just relaying her information.\n\nThank you!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

It turned into a fever of 100.5 and my upper teeth started hurting as if I had an abscess. \n\nBy the morning the dental pain went away. I managed to get in for my morning shift but started to feel increasingly weak.  By the time I got home I couldn barely crawl into bed. Ended up with a fever of 101.2. spent the rest of the day in bed with an awful migraine that made me throw up twice. Meanwhile I started to have random panic attacks. I'd think of something, anything and feel my chest tightening. \n\nFever lasted until about 2 in the morning. I took some Excedrin to get rid of the migraine. it was also the first time that I drink any water in 20 or so hours because I couldn't keep it down before. I tried to take painkillers before but I kept throwing them up so I didn't want to overdose. \n\nI was weak and exhausted but I seem to be okay for the rest of the weekend minus the fact that I kept getting random anxiety and I would feel my chest tighten and my breathing would become extremely nonrhythmic. Fast fast, slow. I was having trouble focussing. In fact focussing on anything at all would make the symptoms worse. Even focussing on the physical sensations in my body would make me start to hyperventilate. Also my neck was hurting a lot. Probably sore from all the weird positions I tried to sleep in but it prevented me from getting quality sleep. \n\nI've dealt with normal mental issues in the past. Some depressive episodes. I've had anxiety in the past. I've learned skills to help me cope with recurrent anxiety. I meditate regularly and I use an EMDR app to help me physically feel calmer. I exercise if it's bad. \n\nI've stopped drinking any coffee since last week. All non caffeine teas. \n\nI've never had anxiety like this before. Something as small as somebody honking at me while I'm driving can set me off into hyperventilating and feeling my chest tighten. When I try to listen to a guided meditation or do my EMDR app I find that my eyes will spontaneously move quickly in a squiggle instead of back and forth like normal. Like all of the techniques I would usually use increase my arousal instead of calming me down. \n\nI don't even have specific triggers. Any kind of thought sends me physically spiraling. Opening up my pantry to look at tea makes my pulse quicken. \n\nI'm still managing to get to work but I'm literally waiting for the moment I can get out because it's so exhausting. My job isn't stressful. It's very enjoyable and calm but the random physical symptoms are very disruptive and keep me from being present.\n\n\nI'm 31 female don't take any drugs prescription or otherwise.

I don't think this is the cause, but I figured it is useful to mention. I also have a history of autoimmune disease (all sorts of em) in my family, and my mother has thyroid issues (Hashimoto's, I think). \n\nWhat's bothering me most is chest pain. It started about two weeks ago and was rather mild/moderate. Felt constrictive and sharp, sometimes as if there was fluid in my lungs, but was on and off for the most part. For the past three days, it has worsened. It is consistent, not getting better with sleep or rest. It feels sharp and is focused in the centre of my chest, occasionally travelling up towards my shoulders. It feels significantly worse when I breathe deeply, lay down, and lay on my sides. When one of these pangs of worse pain comes, I feel faint and almost as if there is not enough oxygen getting into my brain. I have found myself feeling very dizzy and near hysterics. It feels similar to how I felt when they have me a calming drug at the dentists. Needless to say, I feel quite distressed at this. Additionally, I have headaches, earaches, cold hands and feet. \n\nTypically I would assume this is some sort of cold or chest infection, but I have had rapidly steepening (mostly  psychological) symptoms and feel as if this might be connected? For the past 6 months, I have experienced\n\n*  I have found myself unable to stand up for long periods of time, getting dizzy immediately. When I exercise, my hands turn red, hot and puffy (sort of feel like they are filled with blood??)\n* Severe fatigue and drowsiness \n   * I have been sleeping almost too easily, which completely abnormal for me. Despite this, I never feel rested??\n* Excessive thirst\n   * Drinking upwards of 4 litres per day (odd considering I am small with a BMI in the 16's) and still feeling unbearably thirsty\n* Memory loss\n   * This has affected me quite significantly considering the fact that my memory has usually been quite good. \n   * Mostly short term memory problems. I consistently forget whether I have been to the bathroom or not, washed my hands, eaten... This is completely out of character for me and quite distressing\n* Feeling generally sluggish, slowed down, dissociative and depressed.\n* Irritable Bowel \n\nWhilst I don't think my current physical symptoms are related to any of the ones I mentioned in the bullet points, I figured the more information I can give, the better. \n\nI know I should probably get to a doctor, but I figured this could be a starting point and give me some more points to bring up with my doctor. I often find doctors I visit to be quite dismissive of my symptoms given my age and general demeanour. \n\nAnyways, I hope this post reaches somebody. I thank whoever is reading this in advance.

I see PCP every 3 months for my thyroid since it has always been tricky to manage. I use CBD for pain.\n\nSeptember 2019, I was sitting in public speaking class taking notes when I suddenly couldn't write. Mid sentence I just forgot how to move my hand or what writing was. It only lasted a few seconds so I figured it was just a really bad brain fart. I knew I have a tendency to overthink things so I let it go. Eventually it happened a few more times in my other classes. Whatever... I'd been under a lot of stress and had just gotten married, two of my childhood pets had died not even 4 months apart, and school had always been stressful for me as it was.\n\nEarly this past November I started waking up to my arms going numb at night. I thought, \"no big deal, I was probably just sleeping on them.\" Then it started waking me up almost every night. They would be completely numb and then gradually become increasingly painful. Kind of like fire. It wasn't until it happened while I was awake and laying on my back that I started to wonder. It soon began happening more while I was awake and during the day. Occasionally my calves would do the same. Now I have regular episodes of numbness in my fingers and upper arms. I messaged my doctor explaining what was happening and they called me and told me to go to my clinic's urgent care. Doc told me it was a pinched nerve and it'll go away. \n\nSoon after I started getting pressuring chest pains. Again, I thought it was stress and tried to wait and see if it would pass. Doctor said it was stress and told me to chill. Okay...\n\n1AM December 5th. I was laying in bed and unable to sleep. I was watching YouTube videos on my phone when my lower chest, upper abdominal area felt like it was set on fire. It felt like a hot metal scoop under my ribs. The pressure was unbearable. Because I get like super constipated I figured it was probably an episode and later that day drank mag citrate. I eventually crapped my brains out but the pain was getting worse. Something's not right here.\n\nAround midnight we go to the emergency room because the pain became unbearable. I felt as if I was being pinned by a flaming car. That flaming car was squeezing every bit of air out of me. ER did CT, checked my gal bladder, my pancreas, my reproductive system, and a bunch of blood work.\n\nNothing. Everything was fine. I couldn't believe it. I was in agony.\n\nER doc figured it was probably GI related and told me to see my GI doctor but if it gets worse come back. Spoiler alert: It got worse.\n\nMy definition of 10/10 pain took on a whole new meaning. In the next week I went to the ER 3 more times. The pain kept getting worse. I was in a heap on the floor in constant pain for a week. Toradol did nothing, Morphine hardly touched it, and Dilaudid distracted me more than helped with pain. The Vicodin I was given did nothing. I had two CTs, an ultrasound of all of my major organs below the nipple line, and an x-ray. Still nothing.\n\nOne doctor said it was probably an ulcer and put me on Omeprazole and famotidine. I had to stop taking them after a week because my synthroid wasn't absorbing at all and that's no good. It's fine now. Besides, I didn't have heartburn and the pain was more pressuring and like a band, not like a fist.\n\n My GI doctor said it was intestinal spasms and put me on a more frequent dosage of bentyl and low Fodmap diet. I too thought it could be food related and hoped for the best. It didn't matter what I ate, when I ate, or if I took bentyl every 4 hours. The pains just kept happening. \n\nThe frequency eventually went down on it's own and it stopped taking whole days away. I was finally getting back to some normalcy with the occasional pressuring band annoying me and some chest tightness.\n\nAt this point I'm exhausted, I'm stressed about the holidays, and I just want a break from my body. I've become depressed as this has taken over my life. Doctors don't seem to know what to do because the different treatment options haven't made a difference. My wife has told me she missed me as I've been irritable and distant over having been slapped around by my own body. I just wanted it to let me live again. I've had a few moments where I've thought about suicide over the matter.\n\nThen yesterday I started having a hard time moving my legs. They suddenly felt so weak. That weakness was soon joined by soreness. Today they're hard to lift, they're painful and achy, walking is difficult, moving them takes 10x the effort it normally would but I still managed to go to the grocery store. Now my arms are starting to feel the same. I feel so weak and my bones and muscles feel painful and raw. This doesn't feel like my normal body pain. This doesn't feel like my body. What is happening to my body?\n\n\nEvery time I've tried to look for my symptoms, I'm lead to MS. I don't want to believe it. I'm only 23 and I just started back in college. I feel like I've finally figured out what I want to do with my life and now I'm afraid my body is taking that away from me. I have a referral to a Neurologist but they're notoriously hard to get in to where I live. Many of them have months long waiting lists for those who can get in. Most aren't even taking new patients.\n\n\nI don't know what to think or do. I'm physically exhausted. Mentally I'm losing my mind.\n\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas/thoughts/similar experiences?

{"post_id": "eep5e6", "created_utc": 1577128894, "title": "Repeat valsalva caused essential palatal tremor ?", "author": "LA84elliottsmith", "self_text": "Hi. 33M non smoker. Edit: organization, added more details. \n\nI am copy pasting some of the text from a comment I posted in Tinnitus. \n\nLong story short, I had developed a tic where I repeatedly performed the valsalva maneuver and popped my ears. After performing it several times per minute, for a few months, I slowly descended into psychosis. \n\nI originally suffered sensoneural hearing loss from a workplace explosion and had my ears blown out in this explosion. Thereafter I developed the ear popping tic, thinking this was helping to expel fluid in my ears. \n\nI developed palatal myoclonic tremors that now happen constantly yet all CT and MRIs show no brain lesions. It also caused myoclonic spasms when I moved my eyes side to side. \n\nSo this might be the first documented case of essential palatal tremor with eye movements. \n\nMy hopes is that my symptoms might attract the attention of a research hospital. \n\n=============\nI developed a tic where I repeatedly performed a valsalva maneouver several times a minute.\n\nMonths later I woke up in the middle of the night with an audible clicking sound coming from my throat and terror ensues. Over 30 hospital visits complaining of not producing saliva and other psychotic symptoms I developed essential palatal myoclonic tremor as a direct result of repetitive valsalva maneouver. It caused seizures and I now live with constant clicking in the back of my throat and have episodes where I foam at the mouth. I have stopped myself from performing the valsalva maneouver repeatedly and have a significant reduction in symptoms.\n\nJust so you know palatal myoclonus is an objective ear clicking tinnitus. It will continue indefinitely until I get a Botox injection. Clonazepam should help and taking baclofen helps the tremor. But it caused straight up psychosis. I recall that I did a valsalva maneouver in the hospital and began hallucinating steam coming off my cup of cold liquid water. I was terrified and told the nurse I was hallucinating.\n\nAfter this went on from June 2019 to November 2019, I ended up in a hospital in San Diego, having olfactory hallucinations and performing a valsalva maneuver. Having a psychotic episode. I kept telling the staff I was bleeding from my ears and they would look at my ear drum with an otoscope and say no you are not. I had somatic delusions that I had bilateral malignant otitis externa and was going to die soon. I would have episodes that resembled panic attacks but I am convinced they were focal seizures from repeatedly popping my ears. \n\nHoly hell broke lose as I ended up at Scripps Chula Vista hospital screaming that I had an \u201cembolism \u201c and was exposing myself through my hospital gown. An annoyed nurse kept coming in telling me to \u201ccooperate\u201d and lay down but I was convinced I was actively dying. The pressure in my ears was intense. I would do another valsalva maneouver and my heart rate would disappear from the monitor and my oxygen would desaturate. \n\nI frantically told the staff I was dying and nobody knew what the fuck my issue was. \u201cDude you aren\u2019t dying, did you eat an edible ?\u201d I was accused of overdosing on drugs yet my drug test was clean. I probably looked like a schizophrenic who was fucked up on bath salts. \n\nAs I did one more valsalva maneouver I once again saw my vital signs become undetectable from the monitor. I lost control of my body and now only remember shaking violently. I had the sensation that the nerves in the right side of my face were breaking up and that my ears were equalizing pressure in other parts of my body. \n\nThe room began to spin; the room was suddenly full of technicians now holding each limb of my body down and a female nurse injected me with a green liquid right into my stomach. I remember screaming at them that I was sorry and I didn\u2019t know what the fuck was happening to me.  Now speaking was suddenly exhausting. Fade to black. \n\nIt was all noise and static and a blur. I was shaking violently but couldn\u2019t move anything, as I was restrained and now physically strapped to a bed like a violent psychiatric patient losing all control. I never felt more hopeless or terrified in my life. \n\nI clenched my jaw as the nurse popped off a cap to a green liquid-filled syringe with her teeth ... and then she shot me up with a chemical release straight into the left side of my solar plexus. Now, it was like having my very own life temporarily turned \u201coff,\u201d a moment ago. Somewhere in the interim, I forget most of the details and suspect I had a seizure. \n\nAnd so I woke up in an unfamiliar place, after an unknown period of time had elapsed and in a strange part of my life. I pieced all the events together in my sedated state.\n\nI was in a psychiatric hospital , 6 hours from home , after having seizures and being placed on a 51/50 hold. I had a family back home who had phoned the authorities in San Diego and miraculously located me from a distance of nearly four hundred miles.\n\nI was informed by the staff that I had the California border patrol call 911 after going to a hospital in Tijuana Mexico and I tried to re enter the country while in a psychotic state.\n\nI apparently tried to cut in front of hundreds of pissed off people on the pedestrian line of the Mexican side and told them I was having an aneurysm.\n\nYou see, I had performed the valsalva with nearly every exhalation for a a couple of months straight at that point and slowly descended into insanity.\n\nI am doing better now but probably have a seizure disorder now. The story is my own admission of guilt, that I once became a John Doe in a hospital. In a strange and unfamiliar city. I thought I was dying in a place I had never visited, with oppressive and dated green tiles surrounding me amongst apathetic hospital workers who unequivocally gave zero fucks about my life. This was doubly the case once they got my name. I had been red flagged at every hospital in California after visiting the ER 30 times and being diagnosed with somatic symptoms only. Ct scans and MRI scans showed up clean every time.\n\nI got so fed up and frustrated with the diagnostic overshadowing and stereotyping of me as a mental health case \u2014 that I drove my car to the Mexican border just to get a clean evaluation from a doctor that didn\u2019t have access to the database US hospitals share. \n\nAt 3:30AM and having a manic episode, The Mexican Doctor told me I didn\u2019t have an ear infection of that severity. He told me I was incessantly picking both ears and this was causing otitis externa in both ears. I trusted him\u2014but didn\u2019t know what to make of the recent realization that I was constantly hallucinating the scent of burning clove cigarettes.  Hospital Angeles charged me $300 and injected me with some type of antibiotic with an old school syringe. I walked down the desolate Tijuana street to Farmacia La Mas Barata and got some Fluoroquinolone and ear drops from two women who ripped me off. I didn\u2019t give a fuck because I was saved. I actually trusted the Mexican doctor more than the healthcare system that had systematically abused me for months as a throwaway person, a \u201cmental health case. \u201c  \n\nAnyways, my ears looked pretty bad.  But this wasn\u2019t due to the tweaker delusions one encounters while on an amphetamine binge.   The incessant picking ... The sensation of things progressively crawling in my throat and nose and ears were legitimate \u2014this was the progressive and subtle manifestations of myoclonic spasms. Not quite bugs crawling under my skin, but it never stopped. Unlike drug abuse, I couldn\u2019t stop it by not using substances. It tortured me every waking moment\u2014 and most of my moments were waking at this dark time of my life. \n\nAfter the psychotic episode blew over, I finally realized that valsalva maneuvers were slowly increasing my intra cranial pressure to the point that I was having psychotic episodes, then olfactory hallucinations, then myoclonic spasms and visual hallucinations.  I pieced it together only recently and flashed back to a moment when I did a valsalva maneuver, and saw stream rising off my cup. I assured the nurse that I was hallucinating but am generally a sane person. As evidenced by my revelation to her, \u201cI did like twelve hits of acid when I was in my twenties and have never hallucinated like this. \u201c I jumped back in an involuntary bolt of fear as I stuck my finger in my cup and realized the boiling heat I was sensing was purely related to how my inner ear was communicating sensory information to my brain. Sadly, my nurse was not convinced of my sanity and furthermore she refused to give me anything for my anxiety. I got red flagged once again as a possible deluded nutcase. \n\nIt was baffling to me that every MRI came back clean when this myoclonic clicking is usually symptomatic of a brain stem lesion.\n\n======\n\nSome other symptoms. I randomly developed cherry angiomas on my skin one day when the psychosis was running its course. These lesions would cause excruciating ringing in my ears when I pressed on them. It was around the time I had a seizure and I am convinced it had to have been psychosis.\n\nNow that I am returning to normal, I intend on getting a Botox injection to fix this. I also intend on suing any liable medical provider for abusing me under the presumption that I was a mental health patient with no insight.\n\nAnd for fucks sake, if you are a doctor, please stop attributing physical symptoms to \u201csomatism.\u201d  Whatever lazy piece of shit who put this in my chart is going to get nailed to the cross in subsequent malpractice litigation. \n\nWith that, thanks for reading my most vulnerable moments.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I have never lived around smokers. I never had any major health problems for most of my life except for a broken collar bone when I was 5-6. I live in northern Virginia, in an area known for Lyme disease. I have previously lived in Knoxville, Tennessee; (briefly) outside of a nuclear plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Wilmington, North Carolina; Lynchburg, Virginia; Chesapeake Bay, Virginia; and Fairfax, Virginia. \n\nCurrent medication: hydroxyzine, venlafaxine, propranolol, midodrine, birth control, adderall, bupropion, clonidine, ranitidine (although phasing out because of the recent cancer stuff with it), pyridostigmine, montelukast, cromolyn sodium, and 2000ml saline infusions twice a week.\n\nCurrent diagnosises: depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, ADHD, celiac, chronic gastritis, POTS, EDS Type 3, and MCAS.\n\nFamily history: My dad has celiac, and my brother and uncle both have type 1 diabetes. Heart problems run in my family. My maternal grandfather had a very serious heart attack despite being in almost perfect health otherwise. My maternal grandmother died of a rare form of Alzheimer\u2019s (she was very young as well) when I was younger. Closest relative with cancer was my maternal great-grandmother, who had colon cancer. Paternal grandmother had type 2 diabetes. Four of my brothers have severe food allergies. My mother and her family lived in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, right outside of a nuclear facility, for most of her childhood.\n\nSymptoms: severe dizziness, severe fatigue, severe weakness, fainting, confusion, memory loss, severe anxiety/panic attacks, pulsatile tinnitus, ringing in ears, migraines, night sweats, heart palpitations, chest pain/burning, shortness of breath, constantly too cold/too hot, hives/rashes that appear after being in the shower/pool, very bad reactions to insect bites, depression, anxiety, problems breathing when exposed to dust or fur, stomach problems, severe heartburn, swelling/numbness in limbs, extremely sensitive skin.\n\nAlright, here we go. Medical problems run in my family. While I was \u201chealthy\u201d for most of my life, I never really had any major medical issues. I always had trouble going up stairs and keeping up with other kids, but I thought it was normal. It was serious and didn\u2019t severely affect my day or my health. I homeschooled for most of my childhood, and I didn\u2019t really spend a lot of time with other kids my age or doing sports. I never was super overweight or out of shape, but I wasn\u2019t fit either. When my parents started trying to get me into sports, it was difficult but I managed. I tried to start running on the treadmill, but it was extremely difficult and even painful sometimes. But not impossible.  I had dealt with random episodes of dizziness/ears ringing for a long time, but nothing serious. In part due to family issues and a rather traumatizing experience, I began to develop depression and some anxiety in my early middle school years. When I was 13-14 and starting highschool (still homeschooling, however), I began to suffer from panic attacks. My depression and anxiety became very severe. Panic attacks would come out of nowhere and were unbearable. I finally started seeing a counselor in my sophomore year. That summer, I went to camp. Camp was difficult for me and I found myself exhausted, overheated, and unable to participate in most activities. Shortly after I began antidepressants (prozac). Junior year, I decided to transfer to public school. It was my first time in public school, and naturally I dealt with a lot more stress than normal. But, I was enjoying it. It was difficult to go up the stairs or get up in the morning, but I thought it was normal. Prozac wasn\u2019t a good choice for me, so we switched to Lexapro. After only a week on Lexapro, I had crippling back pain. We immediately stopped and tried another option (which, unfortunately, I do not remember the name of). After realizing that this medication was very expensive and not covered by insurance, we switched to venlafaxine. At this point, it was October/September. I was beginning to deal with severe fatigue, and I assumed it was just the new medications and my school schedule. The fatigue began to get increasingly worse, and I was physically unable to stay awake during classes. My dizziness got extreme. While standing for the pledge of allegiance, I almost passed out and had to be almost carried to the nurse. It only got worse from there, and by November I would go straight home from school and nap for the rest of the day. I became weaker and weaker every single day and things such as going up the stairs or climbing into my bed got harder. I started to deal with more and more nausea and heartburn. We finally saw a cardiologist in December, and by mid-January I began to take medications and had been diagnosed with POTS and EDS Type III. A 24 hour heart monitor showed that my heart rate went to almost 200 while I slept. My Apple Watch frequently shows me well into the 130-150 ranges even while resting. Shortly after, I was diagnosed with MCAS. We kept on the medication diligently, but I had very little change. In Summer, we started the IVs. They helped, but not very much. After my dad was diagnosed with celiac in October, we got me tested, and it was positive. I have been off of gluten for over a month, and while I feel less nauseous and have less heartburn, those have been the only changes. I am in constant pain and exhaustion. It\u2019s everything I can do just to get out of bed and do the bare minimum in school. I barely passed Junior year. Some days I can\u2019t even do things like talk to friends or play video games because I am so tired and weak. I sleep 10-12 hours a day and still can\u2019t get up. My heart rate is so fast that I can\u2019t relax, and it physically hurts sometimes from pumping so fast. I\u2019m desperate for some relief. On top of my physical health, my mental health is suffering. Much of that is due to fighting with my family and stress caused by my parents. I have been tested for vitamin deficiencies (including vitamin B), anemia, thyroid problems, heart problems, lung problems, type 1 diabetes, MALS, and food allergies. All were negative. My organs work fantastic, and I\u2019ve got a very strong heart. Apart from somewhat minor stomach/intestinal damage from celiac, the inside of me *looks* great. We are going to test me for Lyme. I am desperate for some answer, or some new thing to look for and try to treat. Anything that can help me. \n\nI know this is super detailed, but I just want help. I need advice. I can\u2019t keep living like this. I\u2019m graduating in June, and I\u2019m just barely passing my classes. I\u2019ll be living on my own in a few years. I love school and work, but I\u2019m so tired and sick that I can\u2019t put any effort into this. Any ideas or suggestions are welcome. Thank you.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

But as time has passed, I have had cognitive and nerve problems creep in, along with some other newer, more niche symptoms. I know this is pissing into the wind, essentially, and that I need to go back to the doctor. But it\u2019s so bad that for the first time in my adult life, I am unemployed\u2014my job became so stressful with all of the below that I eventually just gave my two weeks at a place I\u2019d worked for years, and I\u2019ve languished at home with my mom for the last two months. I don\u2019t know where to go, I\u2019m burnt out after spending years and tons of money going to the rheumatologist, I\u2019m clinically depressed &amp; my energy levels are so low &amp; I\u2019m so sore that it\u2019s been very hard to get myself to do even essential life basics anyway. I used to believe the depression was the chicken coming before the egg; it\u2019s only lately that I\u2019ve considered that it\u2019s become so much worse only ever since I first got sick in 2016. \n\nSo forgive me for asking such a question to Reddit\u2014I guess that question itself is\u2014\n\nWhat should I do &amp; what sort of specialist or tests should I seek if i suspect something like MS (and there\u2019s tons of anecdotal evidence for a lot of things?)\n\nI am currently feeling very low, knowing what I NEED to do (seek medical help) and am looking for encouragement that it\u2019s the right direction to move in, I suppose [a neurology appointment? Hitting up my PC doctor (whom I really don\u2019t care for, and I switched in October to a new one: that initial, 1st available appt is for February) and getting whatever referrals?]\n\nhere\u2019s a copy/paste of a FB status I wrote the other day with pictures of my crazy, bright red toes and soles of my feet only coming at night, a few times a week during flares, at MAX a month apart or so in episodic frequency/reoccurrence \u2014the oddest, most noticeable symptom I\u2019ve dealt with the last 6 months. They go red &amp; become extremely hot, I literally have to put them against my cold window for what\u2019s only weak relief (I always feel like I run too hot, anyway, and sleeping hot? Forget about it\u2014so it\u2019s extra miserable for me, coming in the night hours) I will try to attach these pictures. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m so long winded, it\u2019s just a lot to explain, I\u2019m very stressed and currently kinda bewildered over it.\n\n****\n\nSo I\u2019ve had issues with a lot of weird things the last few years that my doctors are still trying to fully understand. I have taken a handful of different medications for them in the last few years.. The diagnoses my rheumatologist and I talk about are rheumatoid arthritis, something like lupus, arthritis causing nerve damage, ankylosing spondylitis... a bunch of autoimmune possibilities are basically among the choices. I have a lot of symptoms that way, plus my age &amp; some blood tests. Unfortunately, it takes a long time to track the pattern through X rays and bloodwork enough to say stuff definitively, but as of last year, my X Rays show cervical especially, but some other spinal arthritis\u2014shoulders and jaw also affected\u2014in blood, I have high inflammation levels. Tested low on D3 last year, took supplements that supposedly fixed it. I don\u2019t think I tested positive for R factor on last round of bloodwork, but that was last winter.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t know what to make of this, my rheumatologist. My toes. He\u2019s kind of baffled. They get bright red at the toe line &amp; the soles of my feet for a few hours at a time about once every week or two on average. Burning hot sensation wise, warm, swollen &amp; almost \u201cshiny\u201d thin skin to the touch.  My feet will get hives sometimes, and sometimes I get rash-like things. This is very specific and regular with my feet, again, it comes and goes in waves but happens at minimum once a month. We\u2019re trying to tell if it\u2019s just bad inflammation or some kind of nerve damage (and yes, I\u2019m 95% sure I\u2019m not diabetic bc my bloodwork is run about twice a year anyway) ... but there does seem to an issue with neuropathy now, in this specific symptom and a few others like intense fatigue, sensation oddities and just random stuff like new memory problems, executive functioning becoming more difficult &amp; general zoned out, ditzy &amp; detached brain fog (or these are just weird, aggressive inflammation episodes, maybe?  But why my feet?! they last a few hours before ebbing off: is something this dramatic a thing with RA as it advances?)\n\nThe initial intense arthritic episode happened in 2016: it lasted about a year and a half. That time was nothing like this though\u2014worse pain, but much less widespread symptomatically. It\u2019s crept up &amp; escalated over time. To sum it up, for another year and a half or so, the pain, swelling &amp; muscle spasms themselves of the first \u201cattack\u201d had stopped being nearly as intense kind of all at once. It got livable, very manageable. Then it got bad again this year, particularly over the summer/fall, and now it really sucks since it got so cold.\n\nI want to go to a neurologist. . I honestly worry I have something like multiple sclerosis\u2014MS is also autoimmune, but the damaged sustained would be from brain lesions. So. I have this and some other weird sensory issues... I\u2019m absolutely exhausted. 24/7. Have been since mid 2017, but it\u2019s just insane now. I\u2019m very weak. I drop things a lot. I used to have a lot of wonky blood pressure &amp; pulse readings sometimes at check ups that culminated in a little abnormal EKG before, but the doctor ultimately interpreted it as fine. I have a numb, kinda sore left pinky finger knuckle in recent days and it\u2019s loose in the socket, it doesn\u2019t fit in right underneath the thin skin there. That same wrist (left) has bothered me in recent years. A lot of left sided things seem to be more noticeable.\n\nThere are again some rashes on my feet and body when it freaks out doing this, and this is super freaky but all my joints are loose\u2014they feel like bald, shredded brake pads &amp; I... I feel slightly crooked all the time! I can\u2019t hold myself or my head up straight. My jaw is unstable, visibly \u201cdislocates\u201d (I really think I have a jaw injury, like an actual dislocation) and it looks uneven. My chin juts out\u2014something just doesn\u2019t quite \u201cfit\u201d. I can\u2019t hold my shoulders back. There\u2019s a lot of muscular problems all around those areas and tendons that bulge out. I sleep very weird, with my right shoulder always above and behind/supporting my head. Can\u2019t get comfortable otherwise. My whole structure feels unstable! So all of this, wondering \u201cis it a nerve problem? Is it a dislocated joint\u2014good luck finding out bc it all clicks and grinds anyway\u2014or am I just ill, but a hypochondriac? Is my neck wry or something? Is this all from a wicked TMJ problem? Is it a muscular thing? Is it my brain?\u201d My whole body feels so... off. You can imagine what this does after awhile\u2014 \u201cAm I just crazy?\u201d \n\nIt worries the shit out of me, tbh. I wanna know what\u2019s up so bad, but at the same time it kind of scares me, finding out an answer\u2014it sucks with the Medicaid I have right now\u2014just dealt with about a week of \u201cprior authorization\u201d BS regarding an unrelated medication I\u2019ve taken for 10+ years. i\u2019m switching primary doctors and can\u2019t get in to the new one til February (set up in Oct), I can\u2019t afford tons of copays for at least another a month from now, and I can\u2019t afford more sessions of 3X/wk of physical therapy stretching out for at least a couple of months like 2016\u2019s...\n\nBut it\u2019s bad. I know it\u2019s serious, and it is kinda starting to ruin my life a lil bit. I want to know an answer after almost 4 years, just something concrete. It\u2019s possible I\u2019m just on the wrong medications\u2014what if one of those injectable immunosuppressant and a bunch of steroids changed my life?

His treatment: cervical cryotherapy to kill the abnormal tissue where the discharge came from (interesting). I had one session, my discharge clearly decreased but still remained so I had a 2nd one, as previously, doctor's instructions were abstaining from sex for about 2-3 weeks to let my cervix heal. The thing is I got fingered by my crush 4 weeks after cryotherapy, the next day I noticed a mild blood spotting after working out with a mild cramping (maybe my cervix wasn't fully healed idk), the following days I noticed my discharge started to decrease so I got very happy, but later on it started increasing again, till now, 6 weeks after my cryotherapy I still have this unpleasant discharge and I seriously wanna cry, I feel insecure and disgusting.

It\u2019s been a year since I had anything \u2018as strong.\u2019 If only had a few puffs and I was questioning if it was laced with something else. The high was intense. So intense that my brother turned into a reptilian figure. \n\nI have my own beliefs about a reptilian government, but mostly because I fear it. Every fear of mine manifested into my brother and his eyes were snake/lizard-like. Freaked me out. \n\nCouple of days pass, I\u2019m having a good \u2018ol time with relatives and my sister dares that same brother to hiss at me. I, completely sober, went into a complete meltdown, not understanding anything that was going on. Everything that was said to me became cryptic, that I was receiving a \u201creptilian message.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve read that it could simply be an emotional outburst response. But sometimes I don\u2019t even know I\u2019m awake. That everything is just here to interact with and it\u2019s so difficult to find my footing right now. \n\nI do accept that any damage done was increased by my own hand. I\u2019m not ashamed to admit that, I made my own choices. \n\nWould someone please give me an idea on what the heck might be going on? Any help will prepare me for gaining the confidence to seek assistance and to cloak me in my own safe guard to avoid any other triggers. \n\nThanks in advance!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

He was talking and had a 101 fever but otherwise nothing severe. Since then he was suffered multiple seizures and had lost the ability to speak (he was speaking when admitted).

So I\u2019ve been noticing somethings about me that I could really use an opinion on please. Sorry for how long it is\n\nSo I\u2019m going to break my symptoms down into 4 categories. The categories are problems I\u2019ve had for a while, problems I\u2019ve had recently, mental problems and Good Signs.\n\n\n\nProblems I\u2019ve had for awhile **\n\n-Certain drinks and foods give me AWFUL stomach aches for about 10-30 mins then gone. Possibly some diarrhea that night but other then that the stomach ache just goes away. (About 4+ years I\u2019ve had this)\n\n-Frequent constipation (probably my whole life)\n\n-Insomnia(4+years)\n\n\n**I started paying attention recently, some of my other symptoms may have been going on for a long time but I never really payed attention. These are what I remember vividly\n\n\n\nProblems as of recent\n\n-Bloated lower left abdomen feeling at night, maybe a little in the morning. Cant really feel it in the mid day, doesn\u2019t bother me or non existent. It\u2019s like a dull pain or discomfort, mild usually. Some days it\u2019s worse than others, but never unbearable. Switches sides sometimes during the night, but usually left side. Positioning can affect the way it feels. (Could be related to eating but can\u2019t confirm. But a believe there is a difference when I don\u2019t eat it isn\u2019t as prominent, however smaller and lighter things tend to not upset it as much I believe. Could be related to dairy as well)\n\n-Changing stool types, most as of late are nothing concerning and actually consistent for about a week. (Again eating tends to effect this but I can\u2019t confirm. Dairy tends to change it depending on how much I have, certain drinks as well)\n\n-Incomplete bowel movement feeling after bowel movement. I don\u2019t know if this can be put on a scale but at least in my opinion it\u2019s not too uncomfortable. Sometimes it is, but most of the time not. But it\u2019s there, I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s really been going on but it happens about every time.(this I feel has been going on for a little while as well, maybe also as long as the constipation)\n\n\n\nMental problems\n\n-Anxiety, why I made this post. Why I haven\u2019t been able to sleep, I can\u2019t stop worrying all day about whether I\u2019m going to die from this or not. Constantly checking to make sure I\u2019m ok. Shit I started to notice a slight soreness on my gums the other day and spent like 70+ dollars buying various gum disease things, mouthwash, a new toothbrush the whole 9 yards over a slight soreness. Now I\u2019m obsessed with brushing my teeth. Missing one brush now causes great anxiety. I\u2019ve probably looked up my symptoms everyday for the past month. I switched my diet up considerably and now obsessed with counting every last thing that has entered my body, alarmingly so. Definitely affects daily life, too anxious to eat a cookie. Too anxious to eat more then is absolutely required. Driving me crazy, everything I eat or drink scares me in some way. I can\u2019t even enjoy my life too much anymore my anxiety takes over. This post took me an hour and 10 minutes because I needed it to be just right to me, because if I didn\u2019t I would probably get anxious about it.\n\n-Disassociation. Don\u2019t think it\u2019s related but I feel like the world is fake a lot of the time. It\u2019s a horrible feeling, but it\u2019s like thats the kicker. I have to have anxiety, with a side order of everything you live in is a lie. \n\n\n\nGood Signs\n\n-No Blood nowhere\n-Appetite is normal from what I can tell. I can still eat, I\u2019ve never been a crazy eater but I can eat fine currently.\n-No Weight Loss from what I can tell\n-Stool is almost always within a safe color(always) and consistency(sometimes skinner but not commonly and never a need for concern kinda thin) -The constipation isn\u2019t that bad most of the time, some days it\u2019s worse then others.\n-No lumps on my body as far as I can tell\n-No nausea and no vomiting either\n\n\n\nMy concern is definitely the abdominal bloated feeling. It\u2019s uncomfortable, the anxiety too. In fact if any of you can point me in the direction to people I can talk and spill some things about that. I can\u2019t really go to a therapist right now, and better help definitely looks like a scam so I\u2019m not interested. \n\nThank you all!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

{"post_id": "egbycj", "created_utc": 1577457866, "title": "Does this sound like narcolepsy to you?", "author": "kellyatta", "self_text": "I've been dealing with sleep disorders for pretty much my entire life. I noticed it got really bad when I was about 14 and was only sleeping around 6-7 hours a night because of school. I was so sleep deprived that I had a hard time keeping my head up during tests (and would actually end up knocking out during them). This was an every day thing. I would fall asleep for around 10-40 minutes a day in classes and then wake up a little more refreshed. While my attacks happened, I would get hypnagogic hallucinations, and sometimes I would dream after passing out. I would sleep 12+ hours on the weekends to catch up on my sleep in my later high school years and the sleep deprivation attacks wouldn't be as frequent but they still occurred. It was only until after high school and had the time to finally sleep normal again that I no longer got sleep attacks. \"Normal\" sleep to me is an average of 11 hours a night, sometimes it's more and sometimes it's less. I will sometimes take a 2 hour nap in the middle of the day as well. While I doze off I'm usually accompanied with visions/sounds. My eyes are closed but I'm still slightly conscious so I wouldn't say I'm completely asleep. Rarely when I wake up (or right before I wake up? I can't tell) I will see bugs. About a month ago I saw a mosquito on my mosquito net and I got up and tried to swat it away (obviously there was no mosquito). Another time I \"woke\" up and watched a spider dangle itself right above my eyes. These bugs will disappear at some point when I fully awake or when I actually awake, because I cant tell if these hypnapompic hallucinations are while I'm awake or not. This is not an everyday thing but it happens sometimes. A normal everyday thing for me is waking up in the morning after REM, then changing positions in bed, falling asleep 30-60 seconds later and continuing REM sleep instantly. This can happen every 10-20 minutes for up to 4 hours every morning. I'm not sure if I do this in the middle of the night or not (if I do, I don't remember). This morning while trying to wake up from my doze I was in the middle of opening my eyes and seeing my bedroom mirror then closing them and going back to a dream where I was going on a plane. After a little bit of dreaming about the plane I was finally able to snap out of my doze and now I'm awake, just tired, like every day. I should note that my dreams are typically very vivid, and include my senses. Sometimes when I wake up with extremely vivid dreams I get a little weirded out with reality for a few minutes.\n\nTo be clear about this assumption of narcolepsy: I no longer get sleep attacks, that was only when I was sleep deprived from school. Other information: I'm pretty tired during the day, I wouldn't say exhausted, but I definitely never wake up refreshed (which I guess explains me constantly waking up and falling asleep in the mornings). I hardly ever get sleep paralysis, I could probably count the amount of times I've had it. I never had cataplexy, I have been dealing with seizure-like attacks where it's hard to move, but this is due to anxiety. My main issue is hypnagogic(the visions I get while falling asleep) hallucinations, hypnapompic (the visions i get before/after waking up) hallucinations, the 4 hour period where I wake up and fall asleep to REM, and I may be dreaming instantly after sleeping. I don't hallucinate on a daily basis while I'm awake, it is secluded to my sleep, so I think schizophrenia would be ruled out. I talked to my dad about his sleep attacks (because he will fall asleep every time he comes to visit me) and he says he will sometimes dream instantly while dozing off like that. I'm not sure if hes narcoleptic but he does get the sleep attacks in a relaxed situation, not when driving or anything. \nEdit: I also never have trouble sleeping. I can fall asleep in 3 minutes.\nThanks for the help!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Bed bugs, maybe? (They don't like pictures I've looked up, but maybe an allergic reaction?) But I feel like they would have appeared sooner. What may have happened was that when I was camping in OR beforehand, picked up a couple of tiny hitch-hikers that are dining on me when they get the chance.

When I go to any part of the southern US, my skin tends to break out in *some* way: red flaky ears, tiny bumps, etc., but I've never had bumps like these before. (I also tend to get bad allergies in random places, especially when it's rainy, but that usually is in the form of sniffles and watery, itchy eyes. It's been a little rainy here in Vegas) Is this something I should see a certain kind of doctor for? At the very least, I'd like to know what it could be so I could prevent more from popping up.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I think it all started with an accident when I fell onto my arm doing sports. The pain gets worse by pushing exercises, swimming and during sleep. I also get it from outward rotation of the arm and throwing. I've seen two different doctors and they have narrowed it down to my shoulder. The first one said it might be mild impingement, based on an xray, and sent me to physiotherapy to strengthen my rotator cuffs. That didn't help at all and exercise that involves outwards rotation of my arm actually hurts and makes it worse. The second one made me do another xray, which was normal, and an ultrasound where they found a slightly enlarged bursa. I got steroid injections into the bursa but again this didn't help at all for my pain. The zone where it is painful is not the shoulder but on the upper arm, right in the middle of the deltoid. Does anyone have an idea what this could actually be or how to approach it?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I am currently 23, and this is a quick timeline of what's been going on:\n\n* Age 13-14, started experiencing general anxiety for no apparent reason. Also, felt stressed a lot for no real reason either. Doctor thought it might be anxiety/depression so suggested I see a therapist and try some antidepressants. I tried a couple antidepressants and saw a therapist with no success. Antidepressants did absolutely nothing, and therapist was at a loss as to how to help. This generalized anxiety/worry/stress feeling continued.\n* Age 16, while still dealing with the above, I woke up one day after a good night's sleep and felt a little tired. I attributed it to anxiety or stress from school, but it NEVER went away. But it was very mild, so I just let it go and tried making lifestyle changes with no success. Over the months and years, it has very gradually worsened to the point where I'm at now where I can hardly function due to the overwhelming fatigue/brain fog. It is 24/7. Not even a second of feeling better.\n* Age 17-present: Have had nearly every sort of medical testing one can have done, many of them multiple times. Food allergy, vitamin/mineral deficiencies, thyroid, cortisol, testosterone, heavy metals, MRI, EEG, EKG, Lyme disease, Epstein Barr, h pylori, sleep apnea, dietary changes, sleep schedule changes, increase exercise, etc. Have tried a total of 7 different antidepressants/anxieties from different drug classes to see if maybe depression was the culprit. All either did nothing or made me more tired/foggy. I\u2019ve tried Vyvanse, Adderall, Ritalin, kratom, CBD, kava, and countless other supplements. The stimulants all either helped very slightly, but felt very artificial and made my body more anxious but didn\u2019t help my mind, or didn\u2019t do anything. Caffeine in any form doesn\u2019t help either. I\u2019ve seen 3 different psychologists, all of whom were baffled and said they did not know how to help me and have never heard of this before relative to mental health issues. \n\nI feel this intense dissociation feeling 24/7 that has gradually emerged/worsened over the past couple of years. Like I'm so tired, I don't even feel like I'm in real life ever anymore. I feel drunk/drugged, especially as the day progresses. Come 8 PM, I feel so spaced out, the fatigue is unbearable. Sometimes, I feel so tired I feel physically ill. The gradual cognitive decline is shocking (Concentration, alertness, memory, focus, processing/recalling/stumbling over words and sentences, confusion, etc.). My motor skills have also declined badly as well. I bump into things, my reflexes are awful, I miss things when I try and grab them, etc. I feel dizzy/lightheaded when I stand up after sitting or laying down. I now have very low arousal. It's almost impossible to startle me. It's like my body doesn't even process loud noises or scare anymore. I feel anxious/stressed/overwhelmed more easily. Everything feels like a chore, like an ordeal I get to check off. Even if it is something extremely minor or something fun. Decision making is poor, even for relatively minor things. Hypersomnia (Usually fall asleep very easily, rarely have insomnia). Vision has declined (eye floaters, spots, light sensitivity). Eyes are dry/watery off and on. Numbness all over body. Tough to explain, but extremities/body parts feel so utterly exhausted and numb-like to the touch. Like I can feel my arm getting touched by my hand, but can\u2019t feel my hand touching my arm. Senses feel dulled (Hearing, taste, smell, touch) all feel weakened and suppressed, especially as the day goes on and I feel more tired. Sex drive is virtually non-existent. Alcohol hits me much harder now. As a result, I feel intoxicated more easily/quickly. Sometimes 1 beer and I'm already feeling really drunk. I\u2019m slow now both mentally and physically. Head almost always feels very tired and heavy, but I don't get headaches that often. I yawn way too much. Anhedonia and apathy as I\u2019ve gotten tireder and tireder. I have gradually become indifferent to most things. I literally come across like an emotionless zombie now because I am so damn exhausted 24/7. Almost nothing phases or interests me anymore. I feel like I get every cold/flu virus that comes around. And it takes me much longer to get over them. I am emotionally flat lined. One of my eyelids droops a little bit, mostly later in the day and/or when I\u2019m more tired. I feel like I need lots of sleep to \u201crecover\u201d, but all sleep really does is reset me a little bit and is very unrefreshing. All of these symptoms seem to be worse when I\u2019m sick, stressed, get less sleep, etc.\n\nOverall, it feels like I was hit by a truck. From the moment I wake up to the moment I pass out from sheer exhaustion at night. Everything feels like it's suppressed by this fog that has gradually gotten worse over time. For example, caffeine\u2019s effect, sex drive, post-workout adrenaline and endorphins, getting plenty of sleep, etc. I can sort of FEEL all these things for the most part, but it feels hidden and pushed down from this utter exhaustion. It\u2019s like nothing can surpass the fatigue and fog. It's gotten to the point where I feel like I'm living my life from the backseat and am just going through the day mindlessly on autopilot. It literally gives me anxiety and depression to feel like this and not know why, and watch my life just pass me by at the same time. And the thing that sucks is that I WANT to do things and live life, and am still pretty optimistic, but I'm just too out of it, it's embarrassing. I come across like a drugged zombie when I try.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRealistically, the last kind of test I can do at this point is a sleep study, which is in a few weeks. In a way, sadly, I hope they find something. Any advice is greatly appreciated.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

He had a delayed surgery on   16/12/2019 due to high blood pressure and pulse rate. Doctor has performed surgery on the femur and advised that surgery is not suitable    treatment for patella because the broken part is in small pieces. He   said that the broken pieces will join back together by themselves. He   also said that my brother will have some knee stiffness in the future.\n\nI    understand that I should be asking the following questions from the    doctors however my brother is in Pakistan and healthcare facilities are   not that good there and doctors are not very approachable so I just    wanted to get a second opinion on the patella situation.\n\n1. In    the first picture, we can see a broken piece of patella (Circeled in   red). Is this size considered small for the surgery and should be left   to heal on it's own?\n2. In    what ways, his knee stiffness may impact his day to day activities?  Do  you think knee stiffness can be treated for a full recovery?\n3. Any other advice/recommendation is welcome.\n\nIn   the link below,  I have attached most of the scans and reports   available to me at the  moment. I may be able to provide more if needed.

While driving from one city to another, my car stopped at a restaurant and I had some water from a bottle that tasted bad. That night, I had stomach cramps, vomiting, and bubbly, yellow diarrhea. Over the next month while still living in the region, I continued to have intermittent digestive issues (diarrhea and indigestion), and ended up losing around forty pounds over the course of the summer. These digestive issues persisted somewhat when I returned home to the United States in mid-August 2014, but I did not notice anything other than some irregular stools and bloating. I chalked it all up to post-infectious irritable bowel disorder and continued living.\n\nSeveral months later, in May 2015, I fainted on a plane as I started to have digestive issues again. When I reached the emergency room, my metabolic blood work all came back very low, and the doctors said it must've been an error with their testing unit. When I fainted, I voided my bowels and it had a similar color and consistency to the bowel movement that I had after getting sick in Central Asia. After the hospital released me, I continued to have digestive problems, such as loose stools that are a yellowy-brown color and stick to the bowl, significant bloating, and painful indigestion. Despite trying several traditional and conventional medicines, the only thing that made any slight difference was eliminating eliminating gluten and dairy from my diet.\n\nOutside of the digestive system, I have other generalized symptoms - being very vulnerable to the cold (poor circulation - hard to hold frozen food packages, refrigerated drinks, shivering in grocery stores) despite having been someone who wore shorts in the winter his whole life, sore/achy joints (particularly the hips), muscle tightness (calf and feet cramps, spasms), difficulty swallowing, and dryness (eyes and mouth) that is sometimes mixed with itchiness. I have also developed an over-pressurized left ear around the time of his symptoms (meaning that it does not equalize and constantly feels plugged and tight). Before switching to a gluten-free, dairy-free diet, I also had very bad headaches. I still have headaches once in awhile, but they're not as overpowering as they were when this first happened. Moreover, my skin breaks and bleeds very easily, perhaps because it is dry. For example, when blood pressure cuff is put on my arm, it always leaves a mark and small red dots from where the skin was broken (which did not happen prior to becoming sick). My hands often hurt and cramp if I carry heavy bags and my arms go numb fairly easily if someone else is laying on them.\n\nMy tests have all come back largely normal. At this point, I have had all normal results from routine blood work (complete blood count, metabolic panel), specialized blood work (autoimmune diseases, thyroid function, inflammatory markets), and stool samples (mainly for OVA and parasites, but also for fecal fats). I have had a colonoscopy, endoscopy, and a capsule endoscopy, all of which have ruled out inflammatory bowel disease, but found duodenal mucosa showing mild chronic inflammation, mild chronic inactive gastritis, small intestinal mucosa and colonic mucosa mild/non-specific chronic inflammation (which was chalked up to IBS). The only other abnormal findings were a HIDA scan that found my gallbladder at 13% (without the presence of any gallstones though - biliary dyskinesia), mildly low vitamin D, and high ferritin. I have taken albendazole and metronidazole (for parasites), diarrheal medications, pancreatic enzymes, bile acid sequestrant medicine (Welchol), ox bile, iberogast, IBguard, mastic gum, L-glutamine, cod liver oil, multiple probiotics, candibactin AR/BR, betaine HCl, and probably other things that I am forgetting.\n\nI don't have any familial history of inflammatory bowel disease or of gallbladder disease, but I've has gone from around 215 pounds (97.5 kilos) to 155 pounds (70-71 kilos), despite not being able to work out or exercise significantly due to the symptoms.\n\nHere is what I've already been tested for:\n\n**Tests:** All thyroid levels (TSH, T3, T4, Thyroid AB - ATA, TPO), 2x vitamin B12, Folate, ANA, RPR, RF, Lyme (AB Screen), HIV, Magnesium, Phosphate, Gliadin (AB IGG, IGA), 10x Ova and Parasites (incl. fecal leukocyte, salmonella, campylobacter, giardia, yersinia, c diff, e coli), H pylori breath test, cortisol, amylase, lipase, 2x urinalysis, 3x metabolic panels (after irregular one at hospital following syncope), 2x ESR, 2x CRP, 2x lipid panel, RNP antibodies, Smith antibodies, Sjogren's (Anti-SS-A/B), Anti-scleroderma-70 AB, Anti-DNA (DS) AB, HgB Alc with eAG estimation, microsporidia, giardia EIA, hep B, hep C, schistosoma, zinc, vitamin K1, vitamin B6, vitamin A, fecal fats, 3x blood cell counts, GGT, Parathyroid, ceruplasmin, strongyloides, kidney function, 60+ allergy tests, methylmalonic acid, PTT (coagulation), antichromatin AB, centromeric AB, cryoglobulins, IgA/IgE/IgG/IgM, Jo-1 AB, RNP Ab, Sm AB, SSA (Ro), SSB (La)  \n\n**Procedures**: June 2015 MRI of Chest and Neck (showed slightly bulging neck disk, unrelated), SIBO lactulose breath test (May 2018), MRI of Abdomen (June 2018), 2x abdominal ultrasound (last one in May 2019 to look for liver flukes), capsule endoscopy (June 2018), post-syncope EKG, Stress Test, and 24-hour heart monitor (May/June 2015)\n\nAny ideas?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I\u2019ve also been put on Prozac for anxiety about a month ago that I was taking in liquid form so that I can slowly build up to an average dose due to some sensitivity\u2019s I suddenly have to SSRIs. I recently got up to 10ml/40mg after starting at 2ml/8mg at the beginning of the month and gradually increasing. I\u2019ve also had some trouble with brain fog and concentration that I attributed to food intolerance, but it was improving on the low FODMAP diet so far. But today it all got worse again when I suffered, what I\u2019m currently calling, serotonin syndrome because I have went through it once before. However this was a quicker and more intense episode compared to the last time it happened, which lasted around 5-6 hours with my symptoms being confusion, anxiety, heart palpitations, chills and heat flashes, mild hallucinations, and dilated pupils. This time though I had the dilated pupils, chills, heart palpitations, and anxiety, but also my fingernails appeared to lose their color and and had some involuntary leg spasms that lasted about 7-10 minutes. I went to an Urgent care nearby and had an EKG and some bloodwork done, which I\u2019m still waiting to hear back about. But I have had blood tests done for the last few months of all kinds trying to figure out what\u2019s wrong and am hoping this time to get some answers. I guess I\u2019m posting this to see if anyone has any insight or experience with issues like these and can give me some feedback as to what might be the problem, as this has been an ongoing process the last few months and things don\u2019t seem to be improving.\n\nEdit: I went an urgent care yesterday as the episode was still going on but had mostly subsided. They told me it was most likely anxiety which I\u2019m having a hard time agreeing with, mostly because as I had increased dosage it had been fine and these do not feel like panic attacks I\u2019ve had in the past. They gave me hydroxyzine, which is an antihistamine that also can be used to treat anxiety and told me to take it if the symptoms such as heart palpitations or anxiety don\u2019t subside and are keeping me awake. I was unable to sleep and earlier this morning took the hydroxyzine after eating and it knocked me out for about an hour. I work up with all the same issues as before with more intense hallucinations and no leg spasms. After a while of this going on i fell asleep and have just work up.\n\nThe urgent care let me know that the blood tests came back and that nothing looks wrong with them\n\nI\u2019ve also experienced a significant wait loss in the last 2-3 months since being put on the low FODMAP diet. 250 to 212 as of today", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Since 25th dec I\u2019ve had frequent toilet breaks (12 a day) for diarrhoea or clear mucus or badly formed smelly stool. Loads of gas, poor digestion, and halitosis, and burping. There is a certain sort of \u201cheat\u201d which comes and goes from my abdomen (left/right sides).
