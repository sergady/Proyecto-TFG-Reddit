I washed the area with soap and water and even rubbed some peroxide on the area before cutting.\n\nI used sterile blood sugar lancets and poked into my skin. Nothing came out, so I cut a small incision in a + formation. The cyst would not budge, although I did squeeze the area quite hard to try and evacuate the cyst.\n\nI washed the open sore again with soap and water, then hydrogen peroxide and dried it. I then applied a tiny amount of bacitracin to the area with a bandaid. It showed no signs of infection, it was just inflamed from the cutting.\n\nThe next morning (4/29/19) I woke up with a painful sore throat with red spots on my soft palate. No other symptoms. My little sore on my jawline was a bit tender, but not weeping or swollen.\n\nI went to urgent care to get a strep test. The rapid test came back negative. They took a culture, I have not heard back yet Doctor said it was probably a virus.\n\nToday, ( 4/30/19) I woke up many times through the night because of my throat hurting so badly. I also felt pressure in my sinuses and would snort down yellow/ green phlegm from my sinuses.\nI spent the day in bed, very tired, trying to rest. I felt no pain come from the small incision I had may two days before, but my sinuses began to hurt more and I began producing more phlegm from my sinuses. My throat is sore and scratchy still.\n\nAs I took a shower tonight, I noticed that the left side of my neck is very tender. I believe it is where my lymph nodes are.\n\nBecause the painful swelling in my lymph nodes is so close to where I was cutting my cyst the other night, I am worried that I may have a skin infection.\n\nThe strange thing is that the cut on my jaw seems to be healing nicely and shows no sign of infection. It is a bit tender and pink, but nothing alarming. Just in the healing process.\nAre my swollen lymph nodes most likely related to my incision site or due to a virus? Could my sinus and sore throat symptoms be related to the cut I made on my jaw?\n\nI am 23 weeks pregnant and very concerned that any infection I may have will affect my unborn baby. Should I see my doctor again? Should I just rest and wait for things to get better?\n\nI am also concerned this could be CVM, listeria, staph or toxoplasmosis. Should I ask my doctor to test me for these things?\n\nThank you very much for your help.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I posted here a few months ago about some hip pain I was experiencing, but for the last 2 weeks it has almost become debilitating. I am currently traveling in a foreign country, and on top of that am in a very rural location, so seeing a doctor really isn\u2019t an option right now except in emergencies. I\u2019d really appreciate it if someone could look at my symptoms and give me their best guess- right now the only thing I can do is try and PT myself (exercises and stretches) through online research, but not knowing what is causing my pain is making it really hard to research the right stuff and work the right muscles. I\u2019ve looked into sciatica, bursitis, piriformis syndrome, and others and none seem like a perfect fit, although it is hard to tell by reading articles online.\n\nAge&amp;amp;sex: 23 yo, Female   \nHeight &amp;amp; weight: 5\u20195\u201d, ~108 lbs   \nEthnicity: White   \nLocation: Portugal, from USA    \nCurrent medicines: prescription migraine medication when needed, valium for panic attack when needed   \nDuration of complaint: pain lasting over a year, much worse over past 2 weeks   \nPre-existing conditions: scoliosis, migraines, lower back pain, hip pain (right side), NO PRIOR INJURIES. I had x-rays done a year ago and they found nothing out of the ordinary and sent me to PT. PT did some tests and hip stabilization stuff but didn\u2019t tell me what was wrong.\n\nDescription of complaint: So for the past 2 weeks I have been doing much more exercise than I am used to, as I am volunteering on a farm and I used to work in an office. I had the pain prior to this trip (over a year, probably 2) and thought initially that the extra movement would help, but over these 2 weeks it has gotten so much worse. \n\nIf I am walking around or moving constantly it feels fine, but when I sit or lay down (the longer the worse) as soon as I go to stand up I can feel the outside of my right hip tightening and, as of late, spasming(?) as soon as I try to walk or stand up straight. This leads to me hobbling and limping for a few steps, before it hurts so much I need to stop again and hunch over. Even when the spasming stops I am left limping for 5-10 more steps, sometimes more. The pain will last anywhere from 10 seconds to a couple minutes.\n\nIt also hurts when I lay down for bed at the end of the day, and I have yet to find a comfortable position. I try to stretch my hip joint in bed but it doesn\u2019t seem to help and honestly feels like it makes it worse.\n\nI tried some stretches and light exercises today, and I know these things take time, but it honestly feels the same or maybe worse. While stretching I tried to test my flexibility (I\u2019ve always been pretty flexible) and found that when attempting to do walking toe touches (with a straight leg) my left leg can reach about hip level totally straight with no pain or issues, but my right leg can lift about 6 inches off the ground (with a lot of tension in the hip/side butt) with a straight leg before it becomes too painful and I have to bend the knee, which doesn\u2019t let me lift it much higher. Also bending forward to touch my toes (or at all) sends that same hip/butt area into a spasm before I even get mid shin.\n\nEdit to add: Also idk of this is worthy of mentioning, but I have always (since I can remember) sat strangely. All the way through school, and even still, I usually sit with my knees under me (feet under my butt or spread to the sides), my knees tucked up in front of me, or with my legs criss crossed. It just feels more comfortable.\n\nI am happy to answer any other questions about how it feels or try other flexibility/strength tests you can suggest that might help figure this out.

They vary from a mild achey tingley feeling throughout the leg (usually only from around the knee down, with a lot of the antsy tingly feeling concentrated in the back of the knee and back side of the leg, with pain radiating to the front of the leg) with some minor involuntary spasms (I also sometimes voluntarily shake or move or contract the muscles in my legs as it relieves some of the pain), all the way to  violent, jerking, painful, involuntary spasms that other people definitely notice.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor years ever since I heard about restless leg syndrome as a kid I thought that's what it was, but when I got older I read that restless leg syndrome is supposed to be uncomfortable but not described as painful? And it isn't really like a compulsion to move that bothers me (though like I said I sometimes do that to help relieve the pain), it's an actual painful feeling of tight involuntary muscle contractions. The joints in my legs are always very very tight and I have next to zero flexibility and can't straighten my knees out even close to all of the way.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe leg spasms and pain are an almost daily occurrence and usually last until I either fall asleep (it doesn't really prevent me from sleeping as I've heard people with RLS say, it does continue while I'm laying down in bed, but usually by the time I've got the leg spasms, going to sleep is easy and makes them stop i.e. they don't wake me up or anything, they stop by the time I'm asleep) or if I get sort of reinvigorated and get up and do something more active.  The leg spasms occur whether laying or sitting, and the tingling and back of the knee spasms happen even when standing.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sometimes have sharp shooting pins and needle nerve pains randomly even when not fatigued, mostly in my legs but also in other parts of my body. I've wondered if that was related and it was something neurological but I don't know. I read about \"nocturnal leg cramps\" but that sounds more like what people call a Charlie horse? I can't really find much online that describes the sensations I have. I've frequently worried about multiple sclerosis, especially becuase I have two close relatives who were diagnosed in their late 20's/early 30's, but I read that MS isn't something that really is that genetically linked.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, I realized fairly recently that I had something that wasn't as typical as I thought, which is a sacral dimple. My mother was 43 when I was born and I was a surprise pregnancy. She was a very savvy head nurse but I never heard her mention anything about the sacral dimple to me, even though we discussed lots of other medical issues. The dimple is pretty deep and has been there my whole life. I also have had skin tags my whole life and had to have a painful one surgically removed as a teenager, pretty high arched feet that cause a lot of stress and pain to the ball and front of my foot, and almost any physical activity causes me lower back pain (I even frequently had back pain as a much more active child), which are all things that are associated with sacral dimple complications?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n In your opinions, could I potentially have spina bifida occulta or tethered cord syndrome or something related to that, and could those conditions cause these chronic painful leg spasms (which are my main gripe) or is that something completely different?

Do you think that is likely/possible, and would it be possible to access my birth records? I was born in a public hospital in rural New South Wales, Australia in 1999.

I'm a normal weight, I go to the gym and am in overall good shape. I started to experience a slight pain in my right arm when making certain movements. I can move my arm in almost any direction without any pain, and it doesn't feel joint specific. At first, I thought it was some long, thin kind of tendon or ligament that ran alongside the biceps and triceps. But as I have focuses more and more on this sensation, I'm fairly certain it's a vein that is either \"tight\" or in a bad position or something.\n\nI feel this sensation of what I imagine to be too much blood flowing through a vein, kind of like when if you pee too fast or too hard, it hurts your urethra. I feel it when I'm sitting down for a while and i suddenly move my arm to get my phone or something. As if they vein were flowing normally and all of the sudden the muscle movement to grab something forced blood to the area before the vein was ready. I feel it when I do certain pulling movements in the gym, and when I sneeze hard, I feel it.

I have other symptoms as well, but it's a long list and I suspect they may not be related. However, they can be seen in other posts I've made if someone is interested. For now I want to focus on fixing the circulation and feeling cold all the time problem. \n\nI basically feel cold, most of the time and it **doesn't seem to matter what the temperature is,** although obviously it's much worse in the winter. The temperature in my apartment is regularly almost always above 70F, often at 75F or higher, and my hands are still cold. They aren't just cold to me, **they're literally cold to the touch.** Also my skin usually has a pale mottled look indicative of the poor circulation, very unattractive. I can see with my own eyes the **veins in my hands and arms are constricted**. Also some veins in my arms are indented, like very shallow trenches, as if they've collapsed, but they return to normal once blood is flowing appropriately again. It never gets as bad as Raynaud's, which causes the skin to turn white and is painful and then when blood returns there's redness and more pain. It's not like that at all. It kind of seems like Raynaud's in a way, but it's **all the time and it's never painful**, just uncomfortable as you can imagine being cold all the time would be.\n\nIf I get really worked up from exercising or some other rigorous activity, I can finally get blood flowing properly and I'm warm and I feel like a living thing again, rather than a walking corpse. But it doesn't last. The first blast of the AC in the summer or touching a cold drink, washing my hands, etc., and the cold is almost always back and it's stubborn as hell to get warm again. On top of that, with my circulation being poor, **it's often very hard to get the strength up to exercise** and even when I do it **feels like the oxygen is just not getting everywhere optimally** and I tire out quickly. There do seem to be some very rare occasions where I seem immune to my normal problems with the cold and my blood flow is excellent and I seem normal, but I can't for the life of me figure out what makes the difference on those rare and short-lived occasions. \n\n**Hypothyroidism has been ruled out** it seems, as my TSH, T3, and T4 levels have all come back normal with several tests. Also I've had an EKG and an echocardiogram and **my heart function is normal**, though there is a potential small fibroelastoma that showed on the echo, but since my heart function is normal I doubt this is affecting anything. But I have a follow-up with a cardiologist and will ask about this to make sure.  \n\n**Cortisol, Testosterone, Vitamin D, B12,** and numerous other things have been tested and almost everything has always been normal. The only things slightly (very slightly) abnormal have been a low WBC and a slightly high RDW, and slightly high bilirubin but was told this is normal with fasting tests. RDW and WBC only tested abnormal once and have been in the normal range upon 2nd testing. I did test **positive for ANA (titer 1:160, speckled)**, but I was negative for all the antibodies tested. Seeing a rheumatologist to figure that out as well. \n\nI've tried so many things and some help temporarily, but often they stop working or don't last long enough, and so far nothing at all can stop the cold coming when it's triggered by something strong like cold temps outside, holding cold drink, AC blast, etc. Occasionally they can make \"the cold\" go away, but it comes back as soon as something triggers it. All the things that increase nitric oxide seem to help the most, though not enough, but they have side effects like making me feel fatigued, blurry vision, and I'm concerned they might be increasing oxidative stress in the brain as I feel mentally less sharp when taking them.\n\n**Some things I've tried**:\n\n* aspirin\n* krill oil (w/ astaxanthin)\n* riboflavin\n* taurine\n* Vitamin C\n* pterostilbene\n* pycnogenol\n* grape seed extract\n* panax ginseng\n* ginko biloba\n* raw cacao powder\n* gotu kola\n* L-citrulline\n* horse chestnut\n* vinpocetine\n* b12\n* methylfolate\n* NAC\n* MSM\n* Exercise (helps temporarily but a) doesn't last and b) the poor circulation makes it very hard to get up the energy/strength to exercise in the first place)\n* Cold showers\n\nThere are probably some others I've forgotten, but I've tried just about everything you can imagine, though definitely open to further suggestions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** Cold hands and feet almost all the time, poor circulation evident in constricted blood vessels and pale/mottled complexion, many things seemingly ruled out including hypothyroidism. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease help!

I'm abstaining until it fully heals. Scar tissue could complicate this a lot. \n\nThanks\n\nhttps://m.imgur.com/gallery/7VuIyPK", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Please read the entire post first because below I state stuff I have done/tried. It has gone through phases:\n\n* Very dry and very cracked, regular chapstick that I had been using (burts bees) stopped working. upper lip only was cracked and red and had skin flakes all over it. I would go to bed with lip treatment or lotion slathered onto my lips and wake up to super dry lips a few hours later, having to reapply whatever I put on.\n* After a week or two I read that I should move to lip balm, which is better for very dry lips. That helped with the cracking and dryness, but some flakiness remained behind. I was super conscious about this so I made sure to carefully apply lip balm and get the flakes off. Any food I ate might leave stuff behind sticking to my lips, so I had to go into a bathroom and scrap everything off and reapply lip balm. This is when I tried medicated lip balms such as Lip Repair, Carmex, and I'm currently using an EOS medicated one right now.\n* After using the medicated lip balm for a couple weeks, the dryness is still there but not as bad. However, redness has spread to a bit above my upper lip, and I still use the EOS lip balm a lot to keep the dryness under control. It now seems that my upper lip is just barely a little swollen (just barely), but I do think it is.\n\nSome other information:\n\n* 21, male, Caucasian, pretty tall but skinny, located in NorthEast US, has been happening for the last 1-2 months.\n* Have always used chapstick, mainly burts bees, and this kind of happened all at once\n* I have not kissed anyone for a couple months before this started and still haven't.\n* For the past month I have started tracking my water intake very carefully, making sure that I get at least 64 OZ every day.\n* For a day or two I have tried taking allergy medication (Fexofenadine Hydrochloride, 180mg tablets) but it has not really done anything. Do I need to take it consistently for longer than a couple days for it to start working? I was told it might help with the swelling but it did not change anything. I also do not usually have allergies.\n* I was told it might be a virus by a friend, and I should wait it out but it has been a month or two and it is still ongoing. Would a virus stick around this long?\n* I haven't really started anything new in my life, I can't remember anything that I started that would have started causing this. It literally just started happening.\n\nFrom what I can Google, it is either \"Chapped Lips\" or \"Cold Sores\". I don't think I have have cold sores because like I said I have not kissed anyone or done anything like that in the past 5 months (and my GF 5 months ago does not have cold sores/mouth herpes, been with her for a long time). I also have not developed any bumps or lesions in or around my mouth since this has started. Chapped Lips doesn't really tell me anything either. Literally my only symptoms are as follows:\n\n* Dry and cracked, got under control with medicated lip balm\n* Minimal swelling on upper lip\n* Redness on upper lip, extending to just above where the lip ends.\n\nIf anyone could point me to anything that might help me or something that might help reduce the swelling/redness, I would be grateful.\n\nI have also included a picture [here](https://imgur.com/AEDEWof). Sorry for the blurriness, but as you can see the redness continues up past my lip. It has been like this for a while.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I have always been very active, working out at least 10 hours a week. About a year ago i noticed chest discomfort and shortness of breath for the first time while doing some light work around the house. Since then, these symptoms have gradually gotten worse over time to where i can no longer do any physical activity, have trouble breathing when lying down and am unable to keep my job as i can barely physically take care of myself. I do my very best to do some form of exercise to keep my physical conditioning somewhat acceptable, but i'm struggling with 5 minute walks at the moment. The main symptoms are:\n\n* Shortness of breath\n* Tight/pressure feeling in (upper) chest going into my throat. Sometimes feeling like something is stuck in my throat\n* Tight/pressure feeling between shoulder blades\n* Inability to exercise, symptoms worsen significantly upon even the slightest physical exertion\n* Easily exhausted\n* Bad recovery (used to be a track athlete, monitored my heart rate (recovery) for several years. Seems significantly worse now).\n* Dizzyness, weakness\n* Brain fog\n\nAs symptoms began, doctors assured me this was all anxiety. However, i have never had any issues with anxiety/depression before. Since then i've seen 3 independent therapists/psychiatrists, all of which have cleared me for any mental health issues after 20+ sessions with each of them. Nonetheless, I tried Zoloft for 4 months and Xanax for several weeks after. Neither of them had any effect on my symptoms.\n\nAdditionally i've had an extensive medical work-up;\n\n\\- Heart:\n\n* Standard stress test\n* Cardiopulmonary exercise test\n* Electrocardiogram\n* Echocardiogram\n* Perfusion MRI\n* Intrusive coronarography\n* Chest CT\n\nThe most noteworthy conclusions here were a dilated left atrium, extremely low VO2-max despite having a very active lifestyle shortly before symptoms started and a flattening O2-pulse and disproportionally increasing heart rate at the anaerobic threshold during cardiopulmonary exercise test.\n\n\\- Gastroenterological\n\n* 2x endoscopy\n* Manometry\n* 24h ph test\n\nThese revealed relatively mild GERD and a small hiatal hernia. After treatment with pantomed 40mg for several weeks these issues resolved, but symptoms stayed the same.\n\n\\- Lungs\n\n* Tested for asthma, negative\n\n\\- Brain, neurology\n\n* Bran MRI\n* Several other test for neurological diseases.\n\nAll normal.\n\n\\- Muskoskeletal\n\n* Several chiropractors, physiotherapists.\n\nWas checked and treated by several therapists. Did not seem to help and could not give me a clear diagnosis. Didn't find any severe problems.\n\n\\- Hyperventilation\n\n* Ruled out by blood tests several times.\n* Treatment by a certified hyperventilation therapist for 4 months. Ruled out hyperventilation as a cause.\n* Followed several courses focused on breathing (mindfullness, meditation).\n\nMy doctors have been wonderful and provided my with an extensive medical workup. However they don't know where to turn next. My situation is still deteriorating to where i had to quit my job and moved back in with my parents as i can no longer take care of myself.

It varies with how bad it is depending on the week. I\u2019m pretty much nauseous daily but don\u2019t always throw up but then I\u2019ll have a week that I throw up daily or multiple.\n\nWhen it started I thought it was a stomach bug because I couldn\u2019t eat anything and was throwing up and dry heaving for about four or five days. Went to the doc and they took a urine and blood sample as well as doing an X-ray. They said they couldn\u2019t find anything wrong, they said their best guess was stomach ulcers and I needed to see a GI. Said they would write a referral but when I got the paper work there was no referral and just a script for some nausea medications.\n\nThe nausea meds work a little bit not enough to really be helpful. Then about four weeks ago I was throwing up for about 30 hours. I had drank the night before but it was four drinks over the span of three or four hours. Not enough for me to be throwing up over. I went to the doc and they did a urine and blood test again. Said I was super dehydrated and needed to go to the hospital and get a CT scan done.\n\nWent to the hospital, they basically just wanted to give me an iv and send me on my way. I insisted they did a CT scan like the doc said. Nothing came up on the CT scan. Gave me nausea meds and sent me on my way.\n\nSince then I\u2019ve tried changing my diet, eating healthier, avoiding dairy, even tried avoiding gluten. Felt a little better for a few days but then after like four days felt sick again. Things I eat some days will make me throw up but then the next seem fine. The nausea isn\u2019t always good related but seems to be mad worse by eating.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m just so tired of feeling like vomiting daily and it affects me getting things done. I\u2019m in school and it\u2019s finals right now so Inhavent seen a GI yet but plan to once finals are over. \n\nI\u2019m worried that it is stomach ulcers and what that entails, but I\u2019m also worried if it\u2019s not stomach ulcers then they are just gonna give me nausea pills and send me on my way again.

I feel exhausted a lot, and late at night when I try to sleep I get these weird sensations in my throat I can only describe as nausea, but for the months I have had this problem I have not once actually thrown up. When I did go to get this issue checked out back in December, I was told that this was just allergies and to take some medication/nasal spray for it. At this point, I'm mainly just irritated that I cannot find an exact solution to my problem. I am wondering if this is simply allergies overstaying their welcome combined with me thinking it's a bigger problem than it actually is, or if it is actually a big problem.

Help.", "author": "danb007", "self_text": "Dear Redditors.\n\nMy mother struggles with health issues that no doctor was able to solve so far, though she visited probably 40+.  In general, symptoms prevent from normal living in home, as even moving a 3 pound jar may lead to sudden blood pressure increase and deprive energy for whole day. Paresthesia in whole body, tension headaches (as if there were a tightening rim around the head). She tried almost every specialist, from psychotherapist, through neurologist, to osteopathist, and is doing her best to be healthy again. Unfortunately no luck so far. If anyone has any ideas, we would be incredibly grateful. Below you can find more detailed notes of when it started and what was happening along the years.\n\nAge: 70\n\nSex: Female\n\nHeight: 5,3\n\nWeight: 143 pounds\n\nRace: white\n\nLocation: Poland\n\nDuration of complaint: 4,5 years\n\nAny existing relevant medical issues: described above\n\nCurrent medications: Nedal, Doxanorm, Primacor, Pregabalin\n\n2014\n\nIt all started in October 2014, when I started experiencing paresthesia in my feets, which lasted for 3 months, before other symptoms occurred. I also had a feeling as if somebody attached weights to my loins. In recumbent position (lying down on a bed) I felt no paresthesia at all, though they would immediately appear when I stood up.\n\nI tried:\n\n* acupuncture, around 50 visits\n* general massage from physiotherapist\n* massages from physiotherapist that were primarily focused on loins\n\nAfter above:\n\n* paresthesia symptoms increased, and spread to hands, lips.\n\n2015\n\nNo symptoms withdrew. I had first visit in hospital because of high blood pressure.\n\nThat\u2019s why I decided for high blood pressure treatment conducted by cardiologist, we tried different medicine through whole year.\n\nI did tomography of lumbar back, and magnetic resonance of head. With the results I went to 3 different neurologists, they all said that no surgery is required.\n\nNew symptoms occurred. High blood pressure was an issue from time to time. I started to feel sort of headache as if there was a tightening rim around my head. Additionally I felt sort of white noise in my ears. When blood pressure was normal, headache and white noise in ears reduced.\n\nAs few years earlier my husband passed away, family suggested that maybe I should visit psychiatrist. I did not feel I should, and despite having positive emotional state, I did visit. He said that he does not understand why I came to him.\n\n2016\n\nSudden high blood pressure incidents were occurring almost every month and sometimes lasted for 1-2 weeks. Headaches were present no matter what blood pressure I had. Though I realised that headaches disappeared when I was washing my head in front bend position. For high blood pressure I am taking \u00bd pill of Nedal 5mg.\n\nApril.\n\nI visited another physiotherapist who suggested to do the following:\n\n* lying flat on a floor with legs placed on a stool, angle between thighs and calves 90 degrees (30min).\n\nI did above for 3 weeks. Then:\n\n* lying flat on a floor with one leg on a stool, and another leg pulled up to a belly.\n\nI was able to do above just for 3 days, as I started to feel pressure in the tip of my head and ears. In the morning my left leg was numbing. Also sometimes I was losing my balance.\n\nI also noted that when:\n\n* I pulled left leg, it numbed.\n* I pulled right leg, I had pain in the tip of my head, feeling of clogged ears, that leg felt as if it was way hotter.\n\nTherefore physiotherapist told me again to lie flat with both legs on a stool for half an hour a day. It lasted for next month.\n\nJune.\n\nPhysiotherapist suggested to do the following:\n\n* in the morning, lying flat, inhale, then at the bottom of exhale turn head left/right (one side per exhale).\n\nAfter above exercise I was feeling pressure at the back of my head.\n\nFrom 23rd of June to half of July I was doing:\n\n* in the evening, lying flat, both legs under 90degres, for 10minutes.\n\nAfter above I felt pressure at following areas: the top of my head, sides of my head and areas around ears. In the morning I had calfs muscle cramps.\n\nJuly\n\nHigh blood pressure was so severe that I had to visit hospital. Later physiotherapist put kinesiology tapes on my neck. Afer tapes I felt little better.\n\nAgain for 10 days I was doing exercises mentioned above - in the evening lying flat with 90 degrees angle, and in the morning lying flat with head turns during exhales.\n\nAugust\n\nBeing on my knees I took 4.5 pound jar from a bag and put it next to it. Immediately high blood pressure occurred, including pressure in head. I was taking additional medicine to decrease blood pressure.\n\nPhysiotherapist put another set of tapes on my neck. I felt little better.\n\nSeptember\n\nOnce again I had sudden blood pressure increase.\n\nFor the next 6 weeks, for 30 minutes before sleep I have been lying flat with legs bent to 90 degrees, placed on a stool. I could not endure doing that exercise longer, as I had severe pressure in temples. Blood pressure also increased. After consulting that with doctor, I was doing the same for next week, though for 20 minutes.\n\nNovember\n\nDoctor suggested to try laser treatment. I tried it for my cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine. It was little bit better after the treatment.\n\n2017\n\nFor high blood pressure additionally to Nedal I am taking \u00bd pill of Doxanorm 2mg.\n\nJanuary\n\nAnother set of laser treatment.\n\nFebruary\n\nI felt worse in general. I was going for a walks with nordic sticks regularly.\n\nFor the next 3 months I had sudden blood pressure increase once a month.\n\nMay\n\nI literally passed out just in front of my son (that\u2019s me), I was so scared as I completely did not know what was happening. It turned out, electrolytes in my blood were depleted by use of diuretics I was taking for blood pressure control. I ended up in hospital. I received new medicine. Problems persist.\n\nJune\n\nInternist doctor changed medicine for high blood pressure and it helped for that symptom for the next 3 months.\n\nOctober\n\nI went to sanatorium for one 3 weeks. During that time I did regular walks with nordic sticks, but also I had different treatments such as dry bath in carbon dioxide, ionic iontophoresis, massage of hands, magnetic fields. In the sanatorium that rim around my head was gone. Though I did not do any kind of physical work as I do in home, like lifting a jar, kettle etc. After returning home I felt much stronger, though it did not last long, and ended in a split second, when in forward bend position I moved a more or less 10 pounds bag - in that moment I felt sort of electricity going through my body. That night I had high blood pressure, quivers, lack of appetite. After 7 days blood pressure decreased and stabilized. Then I went to physiotherapist who did some exercises with me for my back, and then put kinesiology tapes on my neck. For the one day it was better. But the next day it all started getting worse. I started to experience sort of tension tension in my whole body, anxiety, though blood pressure was ok. I did not have any physical strength to do anything despite lots of will to do so. Complete lack of appetite. I was in terrible state and ended up in hospital.\n\nAccording to doctors from hospital, I was healthy. They said that cause is somatic. I did not feel that way at all, I felt that how I feel is strictly connected to my back, especially when it comes to blood pressure.\n\nNovember\n\n10th of november doctor prescribed me Sertagen. I feel terrible and I am anxious all the time, still there is lack of appetite.\n\nI visited psychiatrist, who withdrew Sertagen and prescribed me Pregabalin (75mg once a day), for the first day I could sleep without worries. Though tension in head still persists, including noise in ears.\n\nI visited physiotherapist/osteopathist who claims, that the problem lies in dysregulated nervous system.\n\nAfter internist doctor consultation, for high blood pressure symptoms additionally to Nedal, Doxanorm, I am taking \u00bd pill of Primacor 10mg.\n\nDecember\n\nPsychiatrist increased dose of Pregabalin to twice a day(75mg).\n\n2018\n\nJanuary\n\nI continue to visit physiotherapist/osteopathist once a week.\n\n13.01 after bending down to take something from a bag I had sort of electricity going through whole body, legs feel as if they were shocked, paresthesia in feets, needles in mouth and belly. In short period of time it occurred 2-3 times. In the evening it ceased. Tightness in head remains.\n\n14.01 I also had that electric shock feeling, though this time it was followed by high blood pressure\n\n15.01 I had involuntary thumb movements. In the evening high blood pressure. \n\n19.01 In the morning after turning my head right I suddenly had feeling as if my head was going to explode inside, followed by high blood pressure. Anxiety, cold, quivering. Inside chest near the heart and armpit I felt as if there were pulsating air bubbles. Complete lack of energy. Paresthesia in lips, feets. Involuntary movement of hands, feets. Quivering lasted for 2 hours.\n\nFor the next days paresthesia were more severe. I noticed increased loss of hair. I have white noise in my ears all the time. Interesting fact is when I go outside, then I do not feel pressure in my head.\n\nMarch\n\nI feel little better, and decided to do magnetic resonance of cervical and lumbar spine. I have also checked my neck carotid with ultrasound.\n\nApril\n\nHeadaches felt as a tightening rim around head are still present despite taking Pregabalin. In the morning I have numbed hands, and my forehead is sweaty. If I move something, or push something (especially with left hand), then I feel that in legs and head. My hands feel as if they were shocked or oversensitive. Paresthesia occurs in face, mainly in temples. Sometimes if I touch anything I feel as if electricity was shocking me. Moreover I have a need to sort of hold the ground with my feet, in order to keep balance. My eyesight got worse. There are some pulsing points in my legs. My head still feels is as if tightened by a rim on it.\n\nMay\n\nAfter doing magnetic resonance of cervical and lumbar spine I went to two different neurosurgeons regarded as best in town. Both of them said that my back does not require spine surgery. \n\nJuly\n\nPsychiatrist prescribes additionally Sulpiride 50mg once a day.\n\nAugust\n\nPsychiatrist increases dosage of Sulpiride to 2 tabs a day.\n\nOctober\n\nPsychiatrist prescribes Paroxinor 20mg, but I was able to take it only for a week, as I had absolutely no energy after taking it. Blood pressure increased.\n\nAfter ophthalmologist suggestions, and after consultation with my psychiatrist I decided to also try 5% CBD oil, 3 times a day 3 drops.\n\nNovember\n\nI decide to take a break from visits to osteopathist. His treatment was mainly based on pressing specific nerves in order regenerate nervous system. \n\n2019\n\nFebruary\n\nPsychiatrist decided to discontinue Sulpride. I do not have shocking electricity in my body as much as lately, however if I try to lift something I feel sort of wave going through my body.\n\nMarch\n\nAfter ophthalmologist suggestions, and after consultation with my psychiatrist I am additionally taking Lithium Orotate 5mg once a day.\n\nApril\n\nI tried doing some stretching exercises, like reaching left/right leg while sitting on a floor. One day I tried to do few wall push ups. It ended up in sudden blood pressure increase, the following days I had more tension around head, less energy to do anything.\n\nFrom time to time if I bend in standing position, kind of electrical shock wave goes through my body. I can not throw even light objects to trash, as that quick movement of throwing hand immediately causes unpleasant symptoms in my head. Similar effect sometimes happens if I stir a tea with a spoon.\n\n21/04 All of a sudden, I started to feel as if somebody were pushing my loins with constant pressure. It lasted for few hours.\n\nTo summarize. \n\n* Since few years. I have sort of dull, squeezing pain in head, but sometimes I just feel as if someone presses the top of my head. No medicine seem to alleviate that, on the contrary, painkillers even increase these feelings. Though all tension disappears if I lay flat in bed.\n* Balance issues. Weak legs. Paresthesia in feets.\n* Numbing right leg from time to time.\n* Lack of energy to live, despite huge will to live fully. There are just a few things I am able to do on my own, as e.g. moving everything heavier than 2 pounds leads to increased high blood pressure, and strange feelings, as if electrical shock wave going through my body.\n* White noise in ears all the time. \n* I can not tilt my head back, as tension in head increases.\n* Bending down on straight legs sometimes causes kind of electrical shock wave going through my whole body.\n* If I crouch and wash my head in front bend position, the tension in the head disappears.  \n* When it comes to high blood pressure, 150 over 90 is already very difficult to endure for me.\n\nCheckups:\n\n* lyme disease, negative\n* thyroid gland, good\n* routine blood tests, results always good\n* lumbar back tomography\n* magnetic resonance of head\n* magnetic resonance of cervical and thoracic spine \n* magnetic resonance of lumbar-sacrum spine, description below\n* magnetic resonance of cervical spine, description below\n* chest roentgen, good\n* ultrasound checkup of neck cartoids, good\n\nMRI Lumbar-Sacrum spine description\n\nMRI scan of lumbar-sacrum part of the spine was performed in images T1 and T2 weighted, in both sagittal and axial planes.

Also I would like to share what I have learned after all of that. Though it seems obvious, but if you have health parents - do something for them if you can, take them for a trip every once in a while. Most probably it would be easier to do for you in the future, but for them it is the opposite.

Maybe some of you have an idea of what's going on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, reasons why I'm not asking this to a real doctor: (1) I don't consider it an important/urgent enough matter, (2) it's something that happens very quickly and doesn't leave behind any trace or evidence that it happened, (3) its's weird and hard to describe, (4) it only happened a few times in my lifetime (maybe like **4 times in my life** so far), and (5) it doesn't impact the rest of my life as they are completely isolated episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo here's the problem:\n\nSometimes, out of nowhere, I get these random, sudden, really painful pains on the lateral side of my right foot (on the left side; see [this photo](https://imgur.com/a/hAmdMg3) for clarification about the location). \n\n* WHERE: Last time it happened (last night), it happened on my **right foot**, but I can't remember if it also happened on my left foot before, in the past. It's possible, but I **think** (I'm about 70% sure about this) that it only happened on my right foot. No past injuries on my feet connected to this problem.\n* WHEN: These pains happen in completely **random situations**: while I'm lying in bed ready to sleep, while changing my clothes, or, the most recent one which happened last night, while sitting on my bed with crossed legs, working on my laptop. It doesn't seem connected to any physical activity, so I can't see any connection between the situations in which these pains happen. And as I said in the introduction, it only happened about 4 times in my lifetime. The earliest I remember it happening, I think it was in middle school (around age 12), right before gym class. I am now 19 years old.\n* HOW: They are **really** painful. So painful that all I can do while it happens is to hold my foot tightly and be as still as possible, hold my breath and pray for it to go away, till the pain passes. The most recent one was so painful I got dizzy and my ears started ringing, and I felt like I was about to faint.   \nThe pain feels like there's something \"growing\" inside that area of my foot: the pain grows gradually but quickly, reaches its peak, and slowly dies down, until it completely disappears.\n* DURATION: They are very quick: they last about **15 seconds.** \n* AFTERMATH: When the pain is over or bearable enough for me to move again, when I touch my foot, the affected area (and only that area) is really **hard on touch**.

They will then scab and heal but they   heal extremely slowly (and might scar...image of 3 week old one below)\n\n\\- They seem to be worse at night, but that might be just because I am trying to sleep and less distracted.\n\n\\-   Before this started I was taking a wide variety of supplements for   other issues (stress related).  I also tried Modafinil from a friend,   which was right around the time this started (I now realize how stupid   this was).  I only took it a few times and stopped because I was getting   itchy.  I have since stopped most supplements (trying Vit. C to reduce   histamine response).\n\n\\- I was also extremely lethargic and had really itchy eyes when all this started, but that seems to be slowly getting better.\n\n\\-   I've been taking Zrytec (10-20mg) and Benadryl (100mg) to manage the   itch.  I cannot sleep without Benadryl because my body itches like   crazy.\n\nAt  first I thought it was  chiggers or bed bugs or something...because I  would be lying there and  feel a tiny jolt in an area right before the  bump and itch  started..almost like something bit me.  I doubt this now  because I have  washed everything, got an air purifier, and the hives or  whatever they  are just pop up in random places one at a time (not a  cluster of  'bites' like the images I've seen of beg bugs, chiggers,  etc.)  They  also pop up randomly through the day as well as at night,  and in area's  that are 'covered'.

Still it looks pretty normal and I thought I was healing.\n\nA few minutes ago I felt my nose running, I smoke a lot of weed and there's pollen out so I didn't think much of it, but when i blew my nose I noticed it was pretty much filled with blood and there were a few tiny blood drops on my shirt and hands. I went to the bathroom and spit bloody mucus in the sink (some bloody, some blood tinged) and I took this picture (m.imgur.com/ck8RoKA) when i blew my nose again.\n\nI kind of figured someone here would have been in this situation before and can tell me if I'm in danger or not. I haven't been to a hospital because I'm not a well off person but I'm only 23, this can't be a permanent thing.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I came to the conclusion that my entire family worked for some government agency and had conspired to poison me because I had some developmental disability that was apparent to everyone except me. There was a small crack in the wall where I thought a camera was recording me. I heard voices of various family members laughing at me through the crack in the wall. I connected past memories to support my delusional theory. I sat on my duffle with my eyes closed, thinking that I might survive if I sit completely still and meditate. I can't remember how long I sat there, or who else walked into the bathroom.

I've been doing balance exercises, band exercises, strengthening work and Ice/Heat baths (its still visibly swollen today) for the last eight months every day.\n\nMRI was negative, and X rays showed no fracture either. It hasn't been too painful in daily activities until this week, before then it was only when i tried to properly run (I could jog OK) and football, which is the ultimate aim, seems forever away for me.

Initially it didn't hurt that much, but I had trouble keeping my arm above my head pain free. After about a month, the real pain started. It always feels like there is something sharp that\u2019s poking me behind my shoulder. Sometimes I get a burning or tingling sensation around the trapezius muscle area. The pain also sometimes refers to the right side of my neck, as well as down my arm to my right two fingers. This pain is more of a dull achy pain.\n\nBy the start of February the pain subsided a decent amount, but there is still a good amount left. Nothing has changed since then. I began doing PT on Feb 22nd, and I'm able to all my stretches daily without the pain getting better or worse. The one thing that did help my pain was doing bench press. I began doing it on the recommendation of my PT, and after I complete 5x5 of 100lbs, the pain would fully go away for about a day. Unfortunately that ended, and now doing bench has no positive or negative effect. \n\nFrom what I can tell, my shoulder pain only gets significantly amplified if I do a repetitive motion with my right hand. A few hours of writing notes on paper will do that, as well as moving my hand around repeatedly during sex. This amplified pain will burn more, and last for a few days. Nothing else will make the overall pain better or worse. I can ride my bike, carry heavy groceries, do bicep curls, etc. The problem is that the pain is just always there. Another weird thing is that the constant sharp pain goes away if i lift my arm above my shoulder level, while the dull pain remains.\n\nI went to see many doctors who gave me X-rays and a shoulder MRI. \n\nThe Doc\u2019s notes on one X-ray stated:\n\nNo evidence of acute fracture or dislocation. Joint spaces and alignment are maintained. Soft tissues are unremarkable.\n\nThe shoulder MRI without contrast preformed on the 30th of January stated: \n\n1. No evidence of rotator cuff tear. 2.

If there is high clinical suspicion for labral pathology, MR arthrography would be suggested for further evaluation.\n\nThey did not recommend me getting a contrast MRI, but maybe that\u2019s just cause it\u2019s a VA hospital and they might not want to pay.

It started in April last year, relatively innocuously, with every once in a while the smell of urine.\n\nThis complaint became more frequent and more severe. After a month or so of this, I began experiencing post-miction fullness, and later still, post-miction dribbling and urinary frequency.\n\nAt this point I had these complaints of urinary leakage every day. I took a urine sample, which came back negative. Same for a sperm sample I submitted later on.\n\nIn the Summer of that year, I went to visit a urologist. The uroflow measurements where normal: no weakness of urinary stream. Transrectal ultrasound of the prostate showed a normal sized prostate.\n\nHe diagnosed me with chronic prostatitis, and prescribed me a course of antibiotics.\n\nStrangely, that afternoon, when I came back from the urologist's office, my urinary complaints where gone for a bit over a week. Did the external pressure on the prostate relieve my symptoms, after having had them for weeks and months straight?\n\nI had some sort of reaction (dizziness) which I attributed to the prescribed Ciprofloxacin, so I discontinued the therapy.\n\nWeeks later, symptoms still persisting, I was in a cinema and for the first time had intense spasm of my pelvic floor with, again for the first time, real urinary urge and leakage.\n\nThat's when I prescribed myself trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and took it for 3 months.\n\nAfter the first week of taking it, the symptoms started subsiding already.\n\nAfter ending this therapy, about December 2018, I was pretty much symptom-free for months. Until about a month ago, the same symptoms of mild urinary leakage starting rearing their ugly heads again, exactly the same as in the beginning, in April 2018.\n\nAn MRI prostate at this time showed no real prostatic problems. Only thing of note was a \"wide open bladder neck\", which I don't recognize as a medical diagnosis (I'm a physician).\n\nIn addition, my urologist doubts that this is a bacterial prostatitis in the first place: negative urine and semen samples. She considers it a nonbacterial prostatitis, for which Ibuprofen didn't help. I'm left wondering why the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole had such a great effect: months of increasing symptoms got better almost immediately.\n\nShe referred me to a pelvic floor physiotherapist, who has prescribed me fluid restriction (I have been drinking 4 liters or more every day for the last ten years) and periodic urination (every 2 hours), as well as conscious pelvic floor relaxation. Her biofeedback machine showed no real signs of hypertonic pelvic floor muscles.\n\nSo I'm wondering if anyone with similar experiences, or a urologist, could point me in the right direction of a diagnosis or next test or treatment.\n\nAlso potentially noteworthy is that my kidney function is relatively poor for my age and mildly decreasing the last few tests (eGFR of about 92). Plus, sometimes there's an oily layer in the toilet puddle after urinating, of which I'm not sure if I had that beforehand. I never had pain, except for that episode of cramping pelvic floor. I never have nycturia, which makes me doubt my own hunch of bacterial prostatitis. In fact, lying down seems protective, and I often feel symptoms first thing in the morning getting up.\n\nIs it at all possible that I overhydrated for a decade, which made my bladder neck insufficient to a degree, increasing symptoms with gravity while standing?\n\nI'm in the situation now, becoming somewhat desperate, because I know symptoms will only be increasing.

Here it goes.\n\nI have been dealing with some severe Gi/Rectal issues that have stumped doctors going on two years now. I have yet to find any sign of treatment that will help fix the problem, or even offer any real relief from the symptoms.\n\nWhile I\u2019ve always had some issues with bowel movements and etc. throughout my life, the severity of the situation started in May of 2017. It may be best to simply bullet point the symptoms and feelings:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* All of a sudden, one day I had an extreme and intense pressure in my rectum.\n* It\u2019s a feeling that feels very localized to my rectum\u2014so nothing with my stomach or anything of the like.\n* On top of being that pressure and presence, I would always feel like I needed to go to the bathroom (bowel).\n* I would be able to go multiple times a day, and yet always and consistently get to a point where I felt that I really needed to get something out\u2014and yet I was unable to do anything.\n* Currently I still go 6-10 times a day (maybe more). Yet I still get to that point multiple times a day where I feel like I really need to go, but can\u2019t.\n* To further clarify, this feeling/pressure/urge to go is ALWAYS there, and NEVER goes away. Only recently have I found that rare few seconds of respite\u2026only for it to come back not too long after.\n* The more I go, the more whatever is causing that pressure gets irritated. So it doesn\u2019t help that I go all the time.\n* The pressure/presence has been painful at times.\n* Important to note by saying that I go 6-10 times a day (often times more), that calculates how many times I am able to successfully have a bowel movement of some shape or size.  That number does not include the times I go to the bathroom without any success.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat have I done about this? Tons. The typical ER/Urgent Care/Primary doctor affair that turned up nothing. I had two surgeries (Anal Sphincterotomy twice over the course of eight or so months), along with about a year or so of consulting a surgical doctor that specialized in this area. When that came to a dead end, I was steered towards a Gastro specialist. After even more specialized screenings/tests, even he couldn\u2019t come up with anything. I also saw a Physical Therapy specialist for the anal muscles, yet none of the stretches or things taught to me there aided me. Panic attacks after the useless second surgery led doctors to think it may be linked to anxiety/depression\u2014so i was told to see a psychiatrist. So I\u2019ve been seeing one for just under over a year and a half. Tried countless of medications. While they might have been doing something, recently I have come to possible discover that they may not have had any big affects. That they simply may have been red herrings/placebos for me to mentally latch onto as a potenial way of getting better.\n\nCurrent stage of treatment that I\u2019m in:", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

So I'm an 18 year old female, 5'4\", \\~120 lbs. from the US.\n\nI've noticed this bump about 4-5 days ago on Wednesday. I noticed it when wiping after peeing because I felt this pressure/pain while wiping over the bump. I took a look in the mirror and saw this bump which looked a little big in my opinion compared to bumps I've had before. The bump doesn't hurt at all unless I apply pressure to it (even then it's not very painful. Just that I feel it) and it seems to be the same size since Wednesday. I've been looking at it every day. Before Wednesday, this bump wasn't there at all so it suddenly just popped up. As of now (Saturday and Sunday morning), the bump doesn't seem to have any slight pain when I apply pressure with my finger unless I'm probing at it and irritating it for a bit. \n\nI'm just afraid that it might be an STD like herpes or HPV. Some history: I had unprotected sex 4 weeks, ended up getting a yeast infection a couple days later diagnosed by my doctor and treated. Since then I haven't shaved and just left my genital area alone besides cleaning as best as I could. I've also gotten the HPV-9 vaccine when I was a kid which I know can help protect against the types of HPV that causes certain cancers and 90% of genital warts. I'm just worried this may be genital warts. I heard the vaccine is very effective but I'm afraid I may fall in that minority of 10% of getting genital warts from HPV types not included in the vaccine. It's also hard for me to distinguish if it's a wart or not since many online sources say a wart could be a single bump as well. I'm not sure if there's puss in it or not. I've tried popping it but nothing happened and so I decided to stop trying, not wanting to make things worse. It feels smooth to touch and not rough at all.\n\nI'm going to message my obgyn about this as well soon but I'm nervous to go in as I just saw her Wednesday before I noticed the bump.

I\u2019m a 25 year old male and since I was around 16 or so I\u2019ve have had the same mental condition without any remittance or change. Ive always had some difficulty concentrating and was rather shy but sometime around the age of 16 it became turbo charged. To sum it up I have a great deal of anxiety at all times and I struggle to think or find the energy to do things. I find it almost impossible to think of things to say when socialising, almost every conversation inevitably breaks down to awkward silences and brief comments as soon as it\u2019s initiated. My coordination is extremely poor and I\u2019m incapable of driving or holding down a job and my libido is extremely muted. I\u2019m incapable of thinking ahead or planning things, I have to write reminders down constantly for even basic tasks since my default state is to just lie in bed and browse the internet. I find it hard to enjoy things, sometimes I can\u2019t even enjoy music or derive any satisfaction from listening to it as an example. My daily schedule generally revolves around lying in bed and browsing the internet, eating, running errands and otherwise not doing much.\n\nWhen I was younger I was severely unhappy and constantly thought of suicide and was terribly bitter about missing out on life and being the way I was. It was intensely humiliating to be good at basically nothing, from academia, to sports to socialising. I was also deeply bitter at watching my future go up in flames and seeing what I was missing out on. Although I\u2019m still very unhappy and scared for the future now I don\u2019t really think of suicide and I\u2019m not as intensely bitter and miserable as I used to be. Although I struggle to articulate in real life I don\u2019t have much of an issue doing it online though I usually don\u2019t have the motivation to do as such. I\u2019ve seen multiple doctors and I\u2019ve come up with multiple diagnoses such as anxiety, autism, depression, psychosis, chronic fatigue syndrome, ADD etc.\n\nI don\u2019t seem to have any issues recognising social cues and people have commented that besides my extreme shyness I don\u2019t seem to have many autistic traits. I\u2019ve known people with autism and I can\u2019t say I have the same traits they have but then I could be wrong. I do tend to be obsessive in some regards and I often find myself creating habits without noticing. Despite one diagnosis of psychosis I\u2019ve never had any kind of hallucinations or delusions and nobody has ever noticed any on my part, including my parents. I don\u2019t have any issues with personal grooming either. In terms of energy I don\u2019t have issues exerting myself but my willpower is severely lacking. I certainly come off to psychs as having depression with my misery, flat affect, disinterested nature and unhappy visage but then why I\u2019m so limited in my capabilities is inexplicable. All kinds of blood tests and health tests have come up with next to nothing, I have no deficiencies or abnormalities. Besides my severe mental impairment I have no other health issues.\n\nI\u2019ve tried antidepressants, antipsychotics, Benzos, beta blockers, stimulants, brain magnetic therapy (can\u2019t remember this one precisely), alternative treatments, powders and supplements and many other such that I can\u2019t remember and have had very few positive results. Just about the only drug that helped was lorazepam and that only helped maybe 15-20% at most. Because of that I strongly suspect I have some kind of severe form of anxiety which inhibits me constantly but I can\u2019t say for sure. That\u2019s basically a summation of my condition and how it\u2019s impacted my life. Both normal doctors and psychs have failed to treat it so far and have generally nailed it as some kind of mental illness. What is your take on it?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

For years now my periods have been crazy sporadic, I've gone months without getting one, to some lasting only a day, others lasting over 7 days, and when I was younger around 15-17 they were so painful I'd almost faint or vomit and consider going to the ER. Nowadays my periods aren't very painful and I might go 1-2 months without having one. Most of the time when I do have one it's usually only old looking blood. The consistency is barely anything like blood. Recently I have had a pretty weak bladder and I have to urinate more often than I have ever before. It's nothing too concerning but it's still a noticeable change. Some nights I wake up to use the bathroom and when I do I'm extremely dizzy and feel sick but if I'm able to fall back asleep when I wake up later I feel completely fine and if I can't fall back asleep I end up having serious stomach pains and throwing up vile the entire day. This has happened like 3-5 times in the past 8 months. I have also had a weird undiagnosed eye condition since I was 10 or 11. Every morning I wake up with dry, red, painful eyes.

TL;DR at the end!\n\nSo I'll get right to it. I'm a 24 year old female 5 feet tall 125 pounds. When I was 18 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and anxiety and have been on lithium, lamictol, seroquel, ever since. I am also on requip for restless leg syndrome. My symptoms have greatly improved on these meds as well as the aid of therapy.\n\nHowever, there are some symptoms that have not gone away and seem to go undetected by doctors when talking about my mental health (which is why I'm thinking they are not related). I have always suspected I may have a learning disability, but have been so focused on other health issues it felt like the last thing I needed to deal with. Now I'm older and I am finally well enough to enter the work force, and now all these weird symptoms are becoming more apparent as I need to utilize those parts of my brain more. Keep in mind these symptoms have been here way before I started these meds so I don't think they are the cause of this. Now, to the symptoms:\n\n\\-Memory recall is really hard. For example, I could never learn my multiplication tables. I studied and studied and studied, was yelled at for not trying hard enough, but I promise you I did. I can't do it or other simple maths in my head. Or do problems like that in my head especially not with any speed.\n\n\\-Imagining things like locations and space in my mind is difficult. I'm often told I have no sense of direction and could not give you instructions to somewhere five minutes down the road.\n\n\\-If you were to ask me what comes after the letter \"G\" I can't imagine the entirety of the alphabet in my mind and find it, I HAVE to go \"a b c d e f g F!\" Another example is is I failed music theory because I can't look at a note on the scale and tell you what it is, I MUST do the F-A-C-E thing and such. It's very frustrating to have to count on my fingers, or write a word down on paper in order to spell it. I know that sort of thing takes practice but I promise you I was practicing every day.\n\n\\- I feel like I begin to dissociate when there are multiple things to consider and process. I literally can't drive because in my mind there is a lot of things making my mind jump around and I can't put them together in anything that makes sense. Trust me, you would not want me on the road with you. It's like my brain wants to process everything all at once or not at all.\n\n\\-I forget things (temporarily) I once knew. As in, a customer will ask me a question about a product I've sold a hundred times and suddenly I don't know anything about it. It all comes back later when I'm not thinking so hard about it, but in the moment is super frustrating and I end up giving them the wrong info. It's as if I can't remember BECAUSE I'm trying to remember.\n\n\\-It's very difficult for me to focus enough to read, I can do it but it seems to take more effort than my peers.\n\n\\- I have great difficulty constructing a timeline. Events often get scrambled.\n\n\\-Units of measurements are hard to visualize especially time and distance.\n\nSo some of these symptoms aren't as aggressive as the others, but you can understand how ALL of them mess me up on-the-job. It sucks because I feel I have all the motivation in the world and put in a lot of effort only to fail and be told I didn't try hard enough. No wonder I hated school! I've gotten very good at hiding it in my adult life, but now that I'm out in the world I would like to confront it.\n\nI'm also aware that all people experience these things to some degree at some point in their life, but for me it's all day everyday, I get so embarrassed trying to avoid certain things because I know I will glitch out. What do you guys think this could be? Is there a way to strengthen these weaknesses?\n\nSo in summation:\n\nTL;DR: 1) Brain glitches when trying to quickly recall things I've committed to memory 2) dissociate when multitasking 3) no sense of direction 4) can't solve problems in my head and must write things down to work through them 5) stress increases symptoms 6) slow reader 7) time and other units of measurement are hard to visualize.

They appear on the top, sides, or bottom of the tongue, and are either white (and almost herpes-looking) in appearance, or just fleshy/tan colored.  They're somewhat hard to the touch, given the surrounding tongue tissue, but not as hard as say a scab.  They reoccur every few weeks to a month, and I can't think of any triggers that would cause a flare-up.  They're very itchy and bothersome, and typically go away after a week (unless treated, see below).  I don't get them anywhere else on my body, and I've tested negative on every STD/HIV test I've taken (I get HIV tests frequently through plasma donation).\n\nI've been to a sexual health doctor, and an ENT, and both had no idea what they were, and said they looked nothing like the usual STDs they see in patients.  The latter assumed it was viral, and prescribed me Triamcinolone Acetonide Dental Paste, which did reduce the time they were active on my tongue, but they still reoccur often.  I started being exclusive with a partner just before they appeared, and she did tell me she was tested positive for HPV long before she met me, but neither her doctors nor mine believe it's related to that.  The sores have not spread to her at all, we limit kissing/contact when I have them, but we have kissed when I've had one after doctors have told me it likely isn't a STD, and she has yet to get any herself after many months.\n\nI'm just getting over a cold now, and one started appearing yesterday on the side of my tongue, probably the biggest so far (figuring due to my compromised immune system).

I've just found this subreddit and thought I'd post in the hope someone might have an idea of what is wrong with me.\n\nI am under the care of a Nephrologist and a Gastroenterologist at my local hospital. Both very good, with my Gastroenterologist being one of the best in the UK. \n\nI am a 30 year old white male. 5'10 and 78kg. Always been slim or a good weight. Non-smoker, light drinker. I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis in November 2013.\n\nI've been on a number of immunosuppressive medications for this but none seemed to work (Asacol, Pentasa first and then Azathioprine). Flares have only been brought under control with Prednisolone.\n\nWhen I was on Azathioprine I started to get breathless very easily. I stopped that medication and started Golimumab monthly injections on a trial. It was then they noticed my kidney function had dropped, and had gotten worse since the Azathioprine started.\n\nI had a kidney biopsy which showed inflammation and scar tissue. They stopped the Golimumab and I was put on steroids again for nearly two years.\n\nMy bowels and kidneys both settled but my eGFR never went back to normal, instead of being around 90-110 it was 130ish.\n\nWent nearly a year with no meds and was okay, then my colitis flared in November 2017 and my kidney function dropped. I was put on a short course of steroids again and the colitis calmed down and my kidneys improved slightly. In January 2018 my eGFR shot up to 270 and my CRP was 70. I was hospitalised and given yet more steroids. At this point I also have Osteoporosis because of the steroids.\n\nA colonoscopy showed my bowels looked normal and another kidney biopsy showed inflammation, so we don't think they're linked.\n\nI have been diagnosed with chronic kidney disease from repeated bouts of acute interstitial nephritis which is the inflammation which causes the damage, leaving scar tissue which reduces my overall kidney function.\n\nRight now my eGFR has stabilized at about 185. I'm told I have about 75% scarring on my kidneys.\n\nI've tried Mycophenalate for my kidneys but didn't react well as I got horrendous migraines. I'd never had them before in my life but was getting them every week for several days, making me vomit and unable to eat, sleep or work.\n\nI'm now on Toficitinib to control my bowels and it's hoped will stop my kidneys getting inflammed again.\n\nCan anyone suggest what might be triggering this kidney issue?\n\nI am told I'm a medical anomaly and someone wants to write a paper about me. I'm hoping someone else has or has heard of a similar experience.\n\nI'd really like something as I've had three kidney biopsies now and every time I get ill I lose more kidney function. Transplant doesn't seem possible if I can't tolerate the anti-rejection drugs and I won't last forever on dialysis.\n\nI'm only 30 and married. I don't see myself living beyond 40 if these patterns of being ill continue. \n\nThank you.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I have since stopped doing this altogether.\n\n\u2022 Initially self-treated with triple antibiotic ointment and bandage; kept it clean and dry; soaked in warm water once a day. Was puffy and developed a tiny bit of semi-opaque liquid/pus, but cleared up. Redness remained, and puffiness went down about a week later. I specifically remember removing a piece of dead skin (note I didn't rip it off, it came off when changing bandage) that was where the cuticle meets nail. Shortly after this, it got puffy again, but never really developed more liquid/pus.\n\n\u2022 Went to MinuteClinic on May 7th; prescribed Cephalexin, been taking religiously for a week now, every 6 hours. \\~2 days remaining. Paper that came with prescription said I should notice improvement in about 2 days, but the redness really hasn't changed.\n\n\u2022 Finger is still red but not puffy. Included current photo. Skin(cuticle) has not re-attached to nail, but that doesn't concern me; I know Paronychia can take a while to fully recover in that sense. The redness however is what still worries me.\n\n\u2022 Originally I was putting one of the strong type bandages on, like the Band-Aid \"Tough Strips\", which protected it entirely from everything, including air, but I noticed the skin under the bandage eventually started to peel, and I assumed this was from keeping it too wet, so I've switched to just a classic plastic bandage, and never wrap it too tightly. I never noticed any negative side effects on the infection itself from either type of bandage.\n\n\u2022 I will note that when I get any sort of bug bite, even a mosquito bite, it tends to grow very red, almost bruising, and is usually much larger than the bite. (NOT the same as the 'target/bulls-eye' reaction!) This has happened literally my entire life, ever since I was a child, and they never get any worse than that. There's just a lot more redness/size compared to most people, and while they sometimes bruise, they all heal and go away in a reasonable amount of time. I assume this is a very mild allergic reaction, and not related, but I just know that I DO tend to take a little longer to heal from certain things like that compared to most.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Is this normal? Is it healing properly? Should I go back to the MinuteClinic and have it looked at again?** When I went the first time they didn't test anything, just prescribed the antibiotics, but I know this kind of infection can also be fungal or viral sometimes? So I'm not sure if I should go back and have it re-evaluated again since it's still red.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso: the weird 'crease' across my finger under the redness is just an impression from the pad of the bandage I just took off. Also x2, it's cold in my house right now, so excuse any lack of colour in my nails or whatever lol", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Canada):  NY\n* Pre-existing medical issues (if any)\n* Current medications (if any):  Naproxen\n* Duration of complaint (how long has this been happening):  1 Year with longer background\n* Symptoms (be specific):  Two issues:  Possible Nerve issues in legs to back and digestive problems\n\nBackground:  I've had a bad back for years now, first noticed it when I was 18 and doing situps, and my lower back would hurt after the 15th crunch.  I've been to Physical Therapy for 3 different occasions, with no noticeable results (for lower back, upper back, and legs).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA year ago I went running (was an avid runner at the time) and did not feel any injury while running.  The next day I woke up and when I would bend down, I would feel a ripping sensation in the back of my heel.   This progressed to both heels (started on the left side), and I went to a doctor who believed it was possible nerve damage from the lower back.  It was getting worse and got the point where I couldn't bend at all past my hips without starting to feel the ripping sensation.  I eventually started seeing a neurologist (after going to my physician &amp; a foot doctor) and was prescribed Gabapentin and Diclofenac Sodium (both meant for nerve issues, to block signals).  This allowed me to stretch my hamstrings, which I was unable to do due to the ripping sensations.  While on the medication, I noticed that I would be constipated for a few days and then was able to go to the bathroom.  I thought this was a side effect of the medication.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a few months, my doctor advised cutting down on the meds, while continuing stretching.  I did so, and saw that the ripping sensation in the heels was totally gone, but I get tingling/numbness in areas ranging from my fingers to my toes, and minor lower back discomfort on occasion (can last for weeks but goes away on its own).  My doctor advised to do physical activity daily and go back to my prior routines (I stopped running).  I started up on an elliptical, and would notice that my middle tow on my right foot would feel kind of strange...and after \\~25 minutes both middle toes would go numb.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack in November, the right side of my foot (the top of the foot) was numb.  All day/night.  No pain - just numb, and only on that side.  This lasted for two months - and I continued stretching all throughout.  The numbness just disappeared.  Now, the nerve running in the back of the leg (middle of leg, down the calf), causes the ripping sensation I felt before, on the slightest touch.  Gently touching the area causes me to feel this \"shock\" down the leg.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got a second opinion (neurologist) and they believed that I started physical activity too soon, and to stop all cardio work - but that other than this everything was fine.  At this point, from doctor 1 I've already taken an EMG exam and an MRI of my lower back - both found nothing.  I went back to doctor 1 and she agreed to just rest/stretch with no cardio for about a year.  She also switched me to Naproxen now, as I told her the previous meds weren't really doing anything anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe digestive issues I mentioned earlier have gotten worse.  I'll be constipated for a few days, and when I'm able to go I have diarrhea.  While I was on the previous meds, I would be constipated but the stool would come out harder.  This issue has gotten worse, and I've noticed that I am also a bit numb in the anal area.  I am unable to push out my stool.  I've been resorting to eating Prunes almost daily/taking laxatives.  My farts smell very bad, and I can feel the stool moving in my stomach area at night (can feel my stomach grumbling).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe issue is not going away, and it has now been 6 months since I stopped doing cardio.  The nerve in my calf area remains very sensitive and the diarrhea seems to be getting worse.  I get tingling/numbness in fingers and toes on occasion, and all my fingers and toes are always cold (or get very hot).  It all seems to be related to a nerve issue, but nobody can figure out exactly what this is.  I've had medical exams done - with no results to explain anything.  I'm currently in the \"rest\" stage still but am worried about why this is getting worse.  Any ideas, or ideas as to what other type of doctor I should go see?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Woke that morning to extreme abdominal pain made worse with walking, Nausea. Abdomen was markedly swollen. I went to bed with abs, and woke up looking about 6 months pregnant. Ultrasound showed large amount of fluid. Rebound pain was a 10. Given IV pain control and ab's. Resolved and discharged in 4 days. No diagnosed cause. \n2001: Intense heartburn, icterus, Off the charts ALT and Alk Phos. Vomiting, abdominal pain. Ultrasound showed a large \"football\" sized cyst that appeared to be originating on the kidney, adrenal, or pancreas. Cyst was compressing the liver. Had CT guided aspiration performed. All fluid was drained from cyst. In total more than 2Liters of unspecified green-tinged fluid. No Sig Findings on histology report. Liver values normalized. \n2001 (6 months later): Cyst recurred. Similar symptoms but no liver elevations. Aspirated again under CT guidance. After aspiration, some sort of alcohol soln' was flushed into the cyst. I was then rolled around the table to be sure that the cyst walls were covered. Follow up CT revealed that cyst was no longer present w/the assumption that it was dissolved by the alcohol. \n2005: GI symptoms as before. CT showed what appeared to an adrenal adenoma. Referred to Oncology. The oncologist stated that fluid was clear with some calcifications, and appeared benign. Decided to monitor. He concurred with the radiologist that it appeared to be coming off of the left adrenal. \n2005-2014: Ignored it. Got used to the symptoms. \n2014: Abdominal pain; CT revealed large left-sided cyst of the abdomen along with free fluid in the pelvis. Was referred for MRI. MRI concurred with CT. Referred to Urology surgeon. Did full urinary work-up. No issues at all. Ran total protein, and full lab panel. Everything WNL. Urology consulted w/gen surgeon. Neither felt comfortable with surgery due to the unknown involvement of pancreas. Referred to Internist. Moved before I saw him. \n2015: No change in symptoms, but increasingly uncomfortable to lay on the left side. MRI performed. MRI noted large cyst on the left side. Unable to see origin; pancreas vs kidney vs adrenal gland. Don't remember exact measurement, but at least 12.5 X 13 cm. multilobular. \nSo if you're still with me... Long story short no one has any idea why, what, or how to manage this thing. No history of abdominal trauma or anything like that.

Just wanna know if this is cuz im fat or maybe something is actually wrong. Lol\n\nI\u2019m an overweight female in my early 20\u2019s but my lower back pain is getting unbearable. It\u2019s worse after working/standing long hours, but it takes a day or two to feel better if I have time off and use that time to sit and rest it.\n\nThe pain is right in the middle like a couple inches above my butt. When I\u2019m up and moving I can manage the pain and walk normally but I have a hard time walking by the time I get home. I literally stumble and use the wall for support for the next several hours or days. My legs/ankles will be understandably sore after running around for 8 hours but they\u2019re functional independently. It doesn\u2019t really feel like my legs can\u2019t support me, but rather the pain in my lower back keeps them from moving forward. It almost feels like a grinding down there, but not up and down, more side to side. That might not make sense but it\u2019s the best I can do to describe it. Stretching after work helps a little but not a lot.\n\nI know losing weight will fix lots of aches and pains, but this issue seems to have gotten worse over the past 4 months or so.

But that's not the point.\n\nMy brother (23M) recently started having similar episodes of coughing and infact 5 minutes ago he almost chocked, started puking and felt burning in his chest *(it was a really scary moment ngl)*, that's when my mom said he has the same thing as she. Though I don't know if she can be 100 percent right on that.\n\nSo my question is, not how we can cure it, but **how do coughing sicknesses transfer from one to other in general?** I assume it can be catched by air but I am also affraid that it might be something chronic? Me and dad don't cough at all.\n\nAdding to that, I just thought about the environment in our home. I would say we keep it fairly clean. Not like maniac everyday whiping shelfes clean but not super dirty poor condition either. **What should I look for in maybe our bed surroundings or everyday utilities that could maybe cause somehow this sickness in 2 of our family members?** Can it be allergic reaction to something that's just everywhere but we didn't think about?\n\nI'm asking this because I'm starting to worry about my health safety. I would not want us all to catch this cough eventually. \n\nI know these questions may seem easy and obvious, but I'm confused with our situation here. My brother was alright all these 3 years so this can't be just a sickness that he caught because he was physically close to my mom (I was too)? It should be something environmental? Or does chronic stuff like that go from mother to son? Does it go to daughter?\n\nI live in Central Asia, if that information could clear the unnecessary questions or misunderstandings.

It's making me miserable. \n\nI had my vitamin D and B12 levels checked in November and although they were sightly low, they were not too low.\n\nI have been eating salads everyday and I eat a healthy amount of food for lunch and dinner. I don't have breakfast generally. My sleep is not great as well. I sleep for like 6 hours and that is not good as well. I've also been having some mild abdominal pains as well.\n\nIf anyone could have any insights, it would be very very helpful! Thanks!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

He doesn't remember if he did or didn't. As soon as he \"hit it\" he felt incredible pain in his leg and couldn't walk or stand on it and couldn't move it without throbbing pain. He said the pain was located in the back of his lower leg about in the middle.  There was absolutely no sign of injury however. It had a tiniest bit of swelling but no redness and the swelling went away very fast and was so insignificant so we assumed he had just pulled or injured a muscle. Fast forward a few days and it starts to feel better, however he says the pain has moved to the right side of his right leg and is no longer in the back. Weird. It comes and goes and today he seems to have relapsed and has a lot of pain in his right side of his right leg again. It's not near as bad as when he started but he's got a notable limp. He's more worried then anything.

He says it's very stiff. He says when he stretches his leg out \"it feels like it's going to tear.\" Again though there isn't even any slight swelling or redness. It looks like a 100% normal leg.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was wondering if this sounds like anything to you that way I can give my poor brother some piece of mind?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Right now I am at a loss and I hope that you can help point me in the right direction. Picking the correct flair is difficult b/c the GI sees no stomach issue and my heart is thought to be healthy by my PCP.\n\nA brief summary:\n\nI was experiencing chest pain (all dates and symptoms are listed below) and I went to urgent care. Doctor said it was probably heart burn. I scheduled an appointment with a PCP. I have seen that doctor/his PA a handful of times (documented below). I also saw a GI Doctor on two occasions who ultimately performed an upper endoscopy (Normal findings).\n\nLet me take it from the beginning. Thank you again for reading.\n\n34 year old male, 5'10\", 210. I lift weights so I appear to be in good shape but my cardiovascular system is awful and my diet historically has been not good.\n\n**July 2018**\n\n\u00b7 Blood work revealed high cholesterol. Nothing else significant.\n\n\u00b7 University Health Center\n\n**August 2018**\n\n\u00b7 Noticed a horizontal line of pulsing pain across left breast. There was no pain or discomfort anywhere else other than my left breast for months August through December. Under the Stanford Pain Scale, this pain was very mild, barely noticeable, and on a Scale of 1 \u2013 10, this pain was a level 1. This pain was only present once a week. However, the pain was consistently felt every Friday evening after a traditional pizza and movie night. As soon as my back hit the couch\u2014I felt the pain. The pain was intermittent throughout the remainder of the evening. No acid reflex.\n\n**September 2018**\n\n\u00b7 Same as above. I did not give the pain much thought.\n\n**October 2018**\n\n\u00b7 Same as above. But the pain starts in the morning about 20-30 minutes after I drink my morning beverage (pre-work out drink with about 150mg of caffeine). On average, 2 per day. I would feel the exact same feeling as described in August 2018. But not every day. Usually 2-3 days per week I would feel the pain. This intermittent pain would only last for about an hour. I historically drank a lot of caffeine. Likely not above 300mg per day though.\n\n**November 2018**\n\n\u00b7 Same as above. I did not change my habits above. The pain only lasted for about an hour.\n\n**December 2018**\n\n\u00b7 Same feeling as above. But, far more prevalent. I felt the pain after every caffeinated drink and unhealthy meal. Towards the end of December I cut caffeine out completely and attempted to clean up diet. Horizontal line of pulsing pain across left breast would last longer. Usually 2-3 hours.\n\n**January 2019**\n\n\u00b7 Horizontal line of pulsing pain across left breast after drinking non-caffeinated beverage in the morning. Pain was more discomforting. On a scale from 1 to 10, pain was a level 2. At times, the pain lasted throughout the day.\n\n**January 7, 2019**\n\n\u00b7 Urgent Care on January 7, 2019. Dr. prescribed Nexium 40mg ED. Diagnosed possible heart burn. Performed EKG that malfunctioned (said I had a heart attack but Dr assured me that the machine was wrong).\n\n**January 11, 2019**\n\n\u00b7 Late night meal before bed. Woke up to burning chest that encompassed center, left and right breasts. Up until this point, I had never experienced burning. Up until this point, pain had always been isolated to left chest.\n\n\u00b7 Arm was complete numb upon waking. This has never happened to me before.\n\n\u00b7 Since this night, my arm still tingles during the day near the fingers\n\n\u00b7 Most mornings I wake up with at least part of my arm numb.

I'm also concerned that maybe I have a bacteria infection. Despite my negative H Pyolri test (shoot). Perhaps I should do it again?

After seeing a doctor, I had negative results for flu and strep throat, and around this time I started feeling highly disoriented. I was unable to drive and had trouble focusing on things and was an emotional wreck and I had no idea why. I went to another doctor and got blood tested for Lyme disease and any other abnormalities and everything came back normal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to now, the day of my prom (figures right) I got a sore throat in the morning and dealt with it for the day and took Advil to reduce swelling in my throat to make swallowing not as painful. Later in the day, I felt my temperature get much higher and started feeling awful. The next morning I wake up and my skin is really hot to the touch. It was at this time that I started feeling disoriented and out of my body like last time. Long story short, the sore throat went away for the most part as well as the temperature. I have been taking two Advil every four hours roughly as well as an Advil cold and sinus to replace two regular Advil for one time. I haven't taken Advil since approximately 12 pm and it is currently around 9 pm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents speculated that since nothing appeared abnormal in my blood work last time that it may have been an anxiety-induced psychosomatic response and that is what is causing me to feel this way. Other random information is that I have been drinking an increased amount of water from my usual (which is admittedly too little) which comes to be about 96 fl oz per day if not more. When listening to things I can hear them perfectly fine and there's no issue, but when I try to look at things it feels like I am struggling to pay attention to it almost as if my eyes can't focus. Last time this happened, this went back to normal after about two weeks. I am just trying to figure out what this strange feeling is and what I can do to fix it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Got sick with similar symptoms as a previous time, and both times had an extremely strange, out-of-body experience where I find it hard to focus on things.

After I assume was around two minutes, my vision and hearing slowly returned. When my vision was first returning, I was seeing things in purple. Normal color slowly returned after, but my vision was still blurry. A worker offered me water and my vision more clearly returned after drinking the water. I suspect it might have something to do with having not eaten at all earlier in the day and that I was super out of breath in a place without good air circulation. I'm scared this might happen again, so I'm wondering if this is an illness or if it's just something that would happen to everyone.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I never har any back issues in my teens years so i didnt give to much importance. In 2015 i had my first severe back pain which didn\u2019t let me walk or move freely for a few days but with some anti inflammatories it went away and stayed dormant till 2018 in which i finally decided to go and have it checked, got a couple of x rays and a lumbar mri, got diagnosed with a mild scoliosis (which my doctor told me its not producing any stress on my back and joint because its probably been there since i was a kid) and a L4-L5 disc bulge without any nerve compression whatsoever. After i got my diagnose i stopped taking my anti inflammatory medicine because i was feeling pretty much normal till one day i went to plug my phone, i bent over and bam (threw my back out) i lost all my back strength and went to the floor, after that i spent a couple of days in severe pain and developed a strange pain in my left side which was new (the usual pain I\u2019ve been feeling for the past years was localized in my right side), this new pain has been with me since October 2018 and its really bothersome because it kinda radiates to the left side of my abdomen too, it sounds strange but it hurts in my backs left side and my abs left side, like something got sprained in there, i practically lost the ability to bend over or flex my back at all, i cant be seated for more than 1 hour before my back starts to get all stiff and my muscles starts to spams, went to the doctor again and recommended physical therapy which i did take 20 sessions which made me a little more flexible but the pain is still there it has obviously decreased but there are some days that i feel that my back is going to brake, I\u2019m starting to feel very weak in my core even thou i exercise regularly and try to strengthen my core too. \n\nI have tried everything, Physical therapy (bough an infrared lamp and a tens unit so i can treat myself at home), core strengthening exercise regularly(4-5 times a week), currently trying chiropractic care which has helped a lot i must admit, but still the pain and inability to flex or sit for a long period of time which i must because i work in a IT department and my job mainly force me to be seated, i try to maintain good posture and my chair is very good and ergonomic, but still cant be seated for long time without my back going into spams mode.\n\nIts really frustrating, my doctor told me that she thinks this pain has become chronic and thats why it still hurts but im sure thats not the case, i must have torn or injury any muscle or ligament the day i threw my back out because this pain is new i started feeling it October 2018 and still feeling it in May 2019 and its completely different from the usual pain i felt because of the disc bulge.\n\nI have become very obsessed with this and its killing me, i had to quit my job because im afraid of hurting my back further and have to undergo surgery, i spend a lot of time in bed because thats the only position i can tolerate for long periods of time, i have become very weak because of it, trying to work out as regularly as possible, this has been my life for the past 8 months and in starting to feel very frustrated about everything.\n\nIt is a very strange back pain that came when i threw my back out, i have no sciatica, no referred pain to my lower extremities, just that left lower back pain that also hurts in my abdomen thats been here for 8 months now, usually being good-worse-good-worse, every time i think its going to go away boom it comes back.\n\nIf any person has any idea what might be causing this pain and a solution i will gladly appreciate the help because I\u2019m starting to go nuts on this, i really need to get my life back but this fucking back pain is driving me nuts.\n\nNote: i also went to a rheumatologist to see if it was some kinda of arthritis and all results came back negative.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I've also been prescribed indomethacin to take as require, but I find it does little more than other Nsaid medication.  \n\n\nParacetamol, ibuprofen, and aspirin all had little effect, making it slightly more manageable maybe changing it from a 6 to a 5.5/10, and doses of 50mg SR tramadol, or 60mg codeine only helped moderately, changing the pain from a 6 to a 5/10 (on an average day with a bit of walking)  \n\n\nIt's only on the right foot, and I've already ruled out gout via blood test at the time of a flare up, and by trying to eat large amounts of foods high in urate, such as shellfish and kidney with no subsequent attack within the following days.  \n\n\nI do have pre-existing issues with my feet, I've walked on my toes since I was young, due to having shortened Achilles and what i assume to be the tendon that connects from my heel to big toe, I also can't flex my feet forward past 90 degrees.  \n\n\nAnother Issues I've had more recently is increased back pain, which I've been told could be foot related, or could be caused by my muscles not being strong enough to support my spine causing other muscles to take the strain. Not sure if that's related though.  \n\n\nI've been sent to about 3 different physiotherapists, one specializing in sports injures, a chiropractor for my back issues, A podiatrist for my back issue, who after a thorough look over didn't note anything wrong in that location, even after mentioning it, rather noting an issue with my gait, as I tended to use the side of my right foot to walk more, and didn't put much weight on the problem area.  \n\n\nI've also had xrays, and ultrasounds, seen 4 different GP's, AND had a blood test, all came to nothing.  \n\n\nI've been told to visit a podiatrist again, but I'm hesitant, because I've been a few times in the past, and they always try to push me to spend 500+ dollars on a set of orthotics, but they always state a different reason, with no mention of any problem the previous one has said.  \nI've also used some in the past and found that due to being so hard, they increased my foot pain, rather than decreased it.  \n\n\nAny idea the cause, or other paths I might be able to take to diagnose it?  \n\n\nHealthcare here is pretty good so I can get a lot done via public health system, and would be willing to put some money towards solving the issue if needed, although specialists can take months for an appointment, and after going through local GP's it feels like i'm being led in circles with very little progress.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Apologies ahead of time if this is like super long and messy. lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Im a 28/M and have been dealing with some pain in my left testicle and groin area. Ive always been into running/basketball/HIIT/ and some light lifting. I have always had some minor issue with my left groin, left lower back but never anything that really hindered any kind of athletic activity and it would always kind of come and go. But about 2 months ago, I started getting a serious pain in my testicle/groin area. I don't remember a specific moment that could have caused it, the pain just started creeping up and as each day went on, it  just got worse and worse.  I of course jumped straight to it being Testicular cancer, So I go to my Doctor and had him check it out. He found no swelling or lumps or anything on my testicles, but send me to get an ultrasound just to be sure. Got the results about 2 weeks later and he said they were negative. No lumps, swelling, cyst or anything. Diagnosed me with a pulled groin and told me no running or lifting for a couple weeks and that I should stretch more and ice the area. So I took a couple weeks off from any kind of excersice, and incorporated more stretching, iced it, even used a head pad but the pain never got better. Which is where I'm at now. I'm almost positive this isnt a pulled groin.  It feels like its something totally different, maybe something more serious.  Ive been googling my symptoms but nothing really seems to fit what I'm dealing with. So I'm hoping by posting on here that if maybe anyone has kind of had the same things that I'm going through to help me figure out what I really have. Cause the pain has gotten to the point where its at all times and I haven't been able to workout or do any kind of excersise for the past 2 months. And since the pain has not gotten any better and doest feel like its going to anytime soon, my biggest fear is that my basketball/running/working days are over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not looking for a diagnoses, I actually have a appt with a Urologist on June 12th, but maybe someone who has dealt with something similar can help me get some insight to what I could possibly be dealing with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's a quick rundown of some of the symptoms Ive experienced:\n\nLeft testicle has sharp pain that shoots up my left side (hip area), and sometimes down my inner thigh. It feels as though something in my testicle is being twisted or knotted up, I guess? if that makes any sense. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSharp stabbing pain in my lower left back sometimes extends to my right side as well. Its like a a sharp nerve pain, and I can feel like a small bump of some kind if I feel around the left side of my back. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd also when I walk, everytime my heel hits the ground I feel the pain being triggered in my back. \n\nAnd sometimes sharp pain in my lower abs depending on how bad the pain is that day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo maybe some of these aren't connected or maybe they are, idk. But Im hoping maybe someone has an idea of what I could from dealing with some of the same stuff.

I have pollen (etc) allergies and am prone to chronic sinus infections and in fact I have scheduled sinus surgery to try to fix it. Last winter, January or February, I had a particularly terrible sinus infection, and since then, I have had some bad symptoms. The main symptom is a frequent feeling of weakness, like I've just done a strenuous workout or I haven't eaten anything in a long time. It seems mostly but not entirely related to eating. After I eat (and it seems to be worse after some foods like pasta and peanut butter, but not always), I feel nauseated, weak, and get a headache. I have very foul gas. It seems like this is worst after lunch, bad after dinner, and rarely after breakfast, but what I eat can influence that. I have oatmeal and fruit for breakfast every day, and it rarely makes me feel bad, but if I have it at lunch, I will feel a little bad, but not consistently that I have been able to tell.\n\nBut this isn't just after I eat.

I've been checked for carpel tunnel multiple times via MRI, ultrasound, and hand tests and found negative.  X-rays of hands show no problem.\n\nI've also rested for months waiting for it to heal on its own and that helps but returns quickly when going back.\n\nIt started 3-4 years ago when I was non-stop at the computer for over a 2 month period constantly either working or playing computer games for 18+ hours a day.  The pain began there and I ignored until it was so painful I was literally forced off.  I know I had tendonapathy at least for sure and waited for it to pass.  But it's like it never has.\n\nI have received steroid shot in the wrist which didn't help.  Steroid shot in the back of 3rd finger base and didn't help.  Steroid shot in front of 3rd finger at base near palm...and that did help considerably.  But it's returned and it's both my 2nd and 3rd fingers.\n\nAny and all ideas please?????", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

So for a while now, probably about a year, I've been experiencing some weird symptoms, I don't have health insurance and don't want to pay to go to the doctor but I can't figure out what's going on. \nI'm only 19, the first thing I noticed was when I was about 15 or 16, I was in gym class and we had to do push ups and every time I would push myself up, I would get this sorta 'click/pulling' feeling near my funnybone, only in my right arm. There was no pain at all, it was just extremely uncomfortable. Then, I don't know if it has anything to do with it, but I was 17 and I had gotten bell's palsy (if you don't know, complete paralysis on the right side of my face). It cleared up pretty quick after taking medications for it. The next thing I noticed, I had gone on a camping trip and was walking around a lot, and my right leg felt really weird. I don't really know how to describe it, there was no pain but the best way I can describe it is that it felt like there was a giant rubber band going from the bottom of my foot to my knee. It just felt like something was off. It still happens, but only occasionally and it's random. It happens when I stretch my leg out too. It's not like a ball feeling either. \nThen, my right knee started hurting after I kept it bent for more than 5 minutes. At first it wasn't bad but it's been getting worse. I have to stretch my leg out for it to go away, and then I get the rubber band feeling lol. If I sit criss cross my foot will start to go numb. Then, the toe closest to my big toe started going numb. It will just go completely numb out of no where. No tingling or pins and needles, just pure nothingness like my toe isn't even there. Then I'll get the feeling back and forget about it until it happens at random again. \nAlso if I stretch my right arm too fast, I get a shock from my elbow to my middle finger. When I stretch my arm, my shoulder almost feels out of place. And the right side of my back feels like there's a rubber band around it vertically, too. I don't know if this is some kind of nerve damage or what. I've been in 2 car accidents and both were pretty bad but I don't remember any physical injuries in them and some of my symptoms started before I was even in the accidents. Other than that though, nothing else traumatic has happened so I don't know where this all came from. My dad has a history with back and neck problems and has had surgery so I don't know if it's hereditary maybe? \n\nKeep in mind that absolutely none of this has any pain involved, except for my knee.

{"post_id": "bsuf6h", "created_utc": 1558790423, "title": "Chronic pain for 9 years.. willing to give away my life savings for help", "author": "sammythecat_", "self_text": "TL DR version: any pressure or movement on my groin area shoots pain down into my feet and outer thighs. An erection causes extreme pain. The only position where there the pain is bearable is when I lie flat on my back on a very soft bed with my feet stretched out in front of me. Any other position ie standing, sitting, lying on my side is not possible for longer periods of time. As a result of all this, I have to lie in bed for most of the day, for about 20 to 22 hours.\n\n- Standing or walking hurts a lot.\n\n- Sitting hurts less, but depends entirely on the chair. If it\u2019s a soft ergonomic chair I can sit for hours sometimes without too much pain. A hard chair is sometimes unbearable, as is a low chair or a stool.\n\n- When I have an erection my feet hurt a lot. This along with squatting is the worst trauma to my feet . I usually wake up during sleep, even if I only have a semi erection during the night. This can be up to 3 to 4 times a night and at worst sometimes even 6 or more.\n\n- Having sex is the most painful of all four of these things, so I keep it to an absolute minimum, about once a week . If I don't have sex I usually have erections during the night anyway, and sometimes that can be worse, ie if I wake up to 4-7 times a night.\n\n- Squatting or bending over is something I have rarely done for 8 or 9 years now. As soon as I squat or stand and reach down (ie to touch my toes) the pain shooting into my feet and legs is absolutely unbearable.\n\n-Going to the toilet and straining to defecate. Urinating is not a problem at all, but if I have to strain, for example when I'm constipated (even mildly) this can also change my the pain in my feet from being bearable to being absolutely painful in less than a minute.\n\n-Lying on a hard surface. I can only lie in the softest mattress where my whole groin area sinks into the bed and has little or no resistance. Lying on a hard surface (like my wifes mattress) is usually unbearable for anything more than 5 or 10 minutes. The pain in my feet and legs just gets too intense.\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nHOW IT HAPPENED\n\nOne afternoon in August 2010 I had come home from a run and called my wife. We had phone sex but I was lying on a very hard surface, slightly softer than linoleum, and was quite uncomfortable. I had a lot of work to do that night and was in a bit of a hurry, otherwise I would have gotten comfortable. Because the surface was so hard. I put a pillow under my bottom, so my whole body was arched. During masturbation (on a downstroke, I must have pushed my penis down too hard) the pain just erupted, and shot down into my legs and feet.\n\nWhen I stood up my thigh and foot hurt. It was like a buzzing sensation, like pins and needles but with no numbness. I didn't think too much of it at the time. I thought I had pulled a muscle or cut off the blood supply temporarily, like when you cross your legs. I\u2019d been injured a few times while doing MMA a few years before that so I was used to strained muscles, pulled ligaments and sprained ankles and assumed that the pain would subside within a week or two.\n\nThe next day I couldn\u2019t go for a jog because every time my foot hit the ground it hurt too much to keep going. At that time I thought there was just something wrong with my foot. Over the next few weeks the pain got worse and worse. I went from going for a jog everyday, to not going for a jog at all and eventually not even a walk anymore. Within three or four months, I cut back my working hours because my feet just couldn't take it anymore. Within half a year of the incident, by the end of 2010, I'd stopped working all together. In February of 2011, I was lying in bed all day long apart from going to the toilet, shower and getting something to eat. Since then it has only gotten worse. It has now gotten to the point where the pain is constant.\n\nWhen the pain is bad. I cant lie on my side at all. And I have not slept on my stomach now for 8 years or 9 years.\n\nI have gone from a working person with reasonably good health and a\n\nreasonably good job and a reasonably happy life to a person who\u2019s just hit 40 and who has spent the past 10 years lying in bed flat on his back, not being able to lie on my side, not being able to lie on my stomach, not being able to curl up in a comfortable position. Let alone being able to freely work, jog, have sex whenever I want or even masturbate. I can do all these things, but they cause extreme, debilitating pain.\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nTHE NATURE OF THE PAIN\n\nMy feet constantly feel cold. I wear socks in summer because of this. When the pain is very moderate, it's a very slight tingling sensation. When the pain is worse, this becomes a buzzing sensation which also feels like burning. When severe, this also becomes a stabbing sensation and at the absolute worst, it's like my whole foot is being crushed. There is only pain, I do not have any numbness in my feet or loss of feeling or strength (apart from the lack of strength resulting from lack of exercise). However, the only thing that neurologist seem to test for is numbness.\n\nBoth of my feet and the front of my thighs (esp the outer side) hurt. There are two areas which are painful: the sides of my foot (ie the outer blade) hurt the most, and so do the top of my feet. There is little to no pain on the soles of my feet, nor is there any pain above my ankles in my calves. The other place is the outer part of my thighs. There's no pain on the back of my legs, on my inner thighs or on my calves.\n\nBoth feet hurt, but the left one the left foot is significantly more sensitive than the right one. If I can lie on my side, it is usually on my right side.\n\nThe best comparison to describe the recovery from the pain would be a sprained ankle. The actual spraining is painful. But walking afterwards is painful with every step and requires recuperation without further trauma. For me, during the trauma itself the pain is just as bad as the recovery. It usually takes about 3 to 4 days to recover from such trauma, ie sex or going for a very short walk. This is why I lie in bed most of the time. If the pain was only present during the trauma, I could deal with the short term pain. The recovery period which usually takes 3-4 days in bed virtually all the time save for going to the toilet, showering and eating. But if I have an erection or multiple erections during the night this can take even longer, up to a week or longer if I am unlucky.\n\nThe pain has gotten so much worse since it started. I used to go on short walks with 1-2 day recovery periods in bed. Now just walking around the house (to eat, shower etc) hurts too much.\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nABOUT ME AND PREVIOUS MEDICAL TREATMENT\n\nI have always been reasonably healthy during my life. Even though I've now spent 9 years in bed. I'm still not overweight. I look pretty pale/out of shape, but most people would after being mainly indoors for almost a decade. But on the whole I am still healthy. I have never had mental problems and love(d) going on a nice walk or jog once a day.\n\nI am motivated. I constantly occupy my time doing useful things or what I can consider to be useful things. But I am completely wasting my life, and I'm in pain constantly and it\u2019s getting worse.\n\nI need help desperately. I am willing to give or pay. All of my money, which is about 20K to anyone that can help me or put me on the right path.\n\nI have seen doctors and specialists, but I have got nowhere because they do the same two or three tests as the previous specialist and then send me home. They see me walking. They see me sitting. They see\n\nme talking quite normally, and they think or insinuate \u201cwell it cant be all that bad, some of my other patients have it really bad\u201d or something along those lines.\n\nBefore any appointment, I cause as little trauma as possible for about a week. Ie no sex, no going for a walk. That way the amount of pain is bearable for me to go and see the doctor. When my feet really hurt, ie the day after a walk, an appointment, sex I can't even imagine standing or sitting for anything longer than a few minutes at a time let alone spending hours in a car/waiting room.\n\nAnd that's how it's been for 9 years. I see a specialist doctor or a neurologist. They look at my previous MRIs/X-Rays etc. Either they send me to do the same scans again or they look at the result of the scan, and they say well there's no problem here and they send me off. I live in Europe so healthcare is free, but not very good unless it is a common issue. I have tried all kinds of medication: Lyrica, Gabapentin, all kinds of SSRI\u2019s and apart from making me feel tired have had very little to no effect.\n\nI have come to the end of my rope. I simply don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I have seen neurologists and as described above. They see me walking in they see me walking out. They test for \u201cnumbness\u201d with a scrape test. There has never been any numbness whatsoever, and I always make sure to tell them there is zero loss of feeling, only pain. But they've do the numbness test, look at past MRI\u2019s and they send me home my feet buzzing/burning in pain and having wasted yet another few hundred Euro and another few weeks of my time.\n\nI have reached the end of my rope and simply cannot live like this anymore. My wife has stood beside me this entire time and she deserves better as well. My life is simply not worth living this way. I am not a depressed kind of person and amazingly enough through all of this I still do not have what would clinically be defined as depression. That doesn\u2019t mean I am in a happy person, but I am more pissed off and angry then I am depressed. In fact through my whole life. I have never had been depressed.\n\nSo in short I am suicidal at this point in time. Not because I want to die but because I can\u2019t bear the pain anymore. I simply cannot live like this anymore and nothing is being done to rectify it. The pain has gotten so much worse as well that I just can\u2019 take anymore.\n\nIf someone could send this to someone else. They know who who might be able to help me. I would also be extremely appreciative. I still have so much to offer. I am still young (relatively!). I still have a lot of motivation. I still have a loving wife. And I really really don\u2019t want to die, but I simply see no other way out. Lying in bed for nine years, in constant pain is something I never ever thought would happen to me in my wildest dreams / nightmares.\n\nIf anyone can help, or point me in the right direction, or share this with someone who can help, I will not only be forever grateful, I will be happy to reward that person financially. I have dealt with a lot of other people\u2019s money in my life and have always been fully honest in my dealings.\n\nAlso if someone can tell me other appropriate boards on which I can post this I would be very appreciative.

Now that I have spent 5K out of pocket, my rheumatologist says it is likely just depression and anxiety.\u00a0\n\nI have had chronic back pain in my mid thoracic spine since I was about 17. The doctor said nothing was wrong, so I just ignored it. I had a bunionectomy January of 2017. I believe the widespread body ache really took off around this time, but I assumed it was part of the recovery. It just never went away. Since then, the pain in my left foot is even worse than the original bunion. (see x-rays below). During my recovery, I started doing yoga and in September 2018, I started a Yoga Teacher Training course. About 3 weeks in, my physical capabilities drastically fell. Multiple joints were in intense pain at random. I could no longer hold any weight on my wrists (think plank pose). This is when I decided to go to the doctor.\u00a0\n\nAfter an exam and blood work, we noticed my vitamin D was very low (14 I think) so I started a high dose. They sent me to a specialist about my wrist. They mentioned I was hyper-mobile, but that it wasn't relevant. Diagnosed me with\u00a0De Quervain's tenosynovitis, but I never thought this was accurate because I was having pain in multiple joint (knees, elbows, wrists, and finger joints). The pain in my wrist would come and go. I then went to a\u00a0rheumatologist. I guess this is kind of where the meat of the story begins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith this doctor, I have had multiple x-rays and MRI. He said I had mild osteoarthritis in my right knee. He also said other than a positive ANA in my blood work, there was no evidence of an autoimmune disorder. We started heading down the road of fibromyalgia (but he will not give me a diagnosis) and tried Cymbalta for chronic pain. I tried this for several months with increasing dosage, but it didn't help my pain at all and gave me essential tremors. Now he has prescribed a 10mg muscle relaxer to take as needed, but I can't see this being a permanent solution. In fact I kind of feel like he is just trying to get rid of me at this point. I have constant pain, ranging from a 3-7, every single day. I literally never wake up with no pain; a 3 is a good day! I don't want to take muscle relaxers as often as I'd need to in order to actually feel real relief. I also AM very hypermobile, always have been. I score a 8/9 on the Beighton scale. But my\u00a0rheumatologist\u00a0says the treatment for hypermobility/potential EDS is the same as for fibro, so there is no point to see a diagnosis for this.\u00a0\n\nI suppose I just have a few specific questions/concerns about my x-rays.\n\n1. I noticed the space between each vertebra is kind of narrowing. I am particularly concerned about this because I have suffered this pain for over 10 years, my left collarbone sticks out a bit, and my back pops with every deep inhale. However, I was told that the curvature in my spine is likely too small to even cause any discomfort.\n\n2. If I do have osteoarthritis in my right knee (and potentially other joints), is there no way to prevent more damage? I keep hearing that I am too young to have osteoarthritis, but I don't know if this is something I even have control over. Could my hypermobility have an effect on this?\n\n3. In regard to my left foot post surgery, is it normal for me to be in even worse pain than before? I regret getting this surgery and feel worse off than before. I have no been told the only option I have for any pain relief is another surgery. I'd like to avoid this if possible.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

For years no doctor, no psychiatrist and no neurologist have been able to determine what disease it is, I like my family, I am from Mexico, I would like to know if there is anyone who has any idea what disease it could be or if you have heard of a known case, doctors have ruled out Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n\nThe first symptoms seem to appear between the ages of 38 and 40. At first the person seems to be distracted, has work to do simple operations such as adding, multiplying or dividing. He constantly loses objects, keys, cell phone, wallet. These insidents become more and more frequent. After a little more than a year the person has problems to speak, has problems to find the adequate words when speaking, however he understands perfectly, the person constantly stumbles, from time to time he makes mistakes in daily situations, like putting on his shoes again, but he realizes the mistake and fixes it, by this time the person is no longer able to perform complex tasks, has problems using a computer for example despite having used it before for years, writing your handwriting is bad compared to before, it costs you to write, all of the above causes problems in your job so you are normally fired.\n\nAfter about two years with the symptoms, everything gets worse, it is almost impossible for him to finish a sentence, he constantly puts his clothes in the revez and does not realize it, he stumbles constantly, simple tasks such as going to the store, cooking, washing dishes are very complicated for him, he has problems holding a spoon while eating, the content falls, at these heights the person loses almost completely his ability to read, it is important to emphasize that he understands perfectly when spoken to him, even with his difficulty to speak, it is possible for him to remember events of many years ago in detail.\n\nAfter more than 3 years the person has enough problems to walk, he needs to hold on to some object so as not to lose his balance, if he falls he is not able to get up by himself. Now he is only able to say isolated words, but maintaining the context, he can say: \"food\" when he is hungry, \"water\" when he is thirsty, he is able to show affection, hugs, kisses, say \"I love you\". He is only able to eat with his hands, but he can have problems with food with bones such as chicken, because he is not able to remove them.\n\nAfter about 4 years is no longer able to stand, needs a wheelchair, but is unable to move it, can not say a word, seems to be able to recognize people, and understand contexts, in fact seems to understand despite not being able to speak, laughs with a joke, is excited when you talk about the past or when you receive a gift\n\nAt the age of five the person worsens to the point of not being able to eat on their own, continues to respond to stimuli, still seems to recognize people and react to the context, but seems trapped in his body, can not hold a glass, after a few months has difficulty swallowing food and dies, could probably live longer being intubated in a hospital, but the person will not regain his quality of life.\n\nThese observations have been from several relatives now dead, there have been cases where the disease reaches its most advanced point in just 2 years.\n\nDoes anyone know what disease it could be?

First of all, I've had several fans in the past that have diagnosed ADHD and they take medicine for it. I've asked them and the people they know and they have unanimously agreed that I do have it. I've also noticed that I connect with them more than anyone else, including celebrities, characters, etc. They would talk about their symptoms and I would understand them more than others seem to. I would also tell them things in ways that have confused others and they understand it perfectly.\n\nI've also taken a lot of online quizzes (I know these aren't actual diagnoses and I don't take them as such) and they've all said I have \"moderate to severe ADHD/ a high chance of/ lot of signs, etc\" I have a lot of fidgets and twitches, trouble paying attention to things that aren't interesting. So many time, I've been reading something and I realize I haven't paying attention and I remembered nothing of what I've read. Same goes for videos, movies, music, really any for of media.

And I'm constantly thinking, I have a million thoughts a minute and it gets frustrating at times. I'll have moments where I'll wish I wasn't thinking but I can't stop, it's a bit of a nightmare at times. My mind feels tired the way that your legs can get tired from standing up all day. But it's not because I had to think hard about a report for work or a chess match or anything like that, just all the idle thoughts throughout the day leave me feeling mentally exhausted. I remember a few glorious moments where my brain just shut the fuck up and I was able to not think about anything. That was so refreshing.\n\nExample of my train of thought: I'm listening to a podcast and someone mentions an apple. Now I'm thinking about \"How bout them apples?\" from Good Will Hunting &gt; Robin Williams was great in that movie &gt; He was a great comedian too &gt; Joe Rogan talked about Robin Williams once &gt; Man, I'd love to be on his podcast. All in the span of 30-45 seconds, just back to back\n\nI also have several unfinished projects, I write rap, standup, a Youtube channel I'm gonna start and an idea for a webshow and I have so many unfinished songs and bits and stuff that I'll just stop working on for no reason and leave it all but abandoned. I tend to get restless when I'm not being stimulated by anything or waiting my turn in a game or conversation. I have very little patience\n\nBased on all of this and a few other things, I'm certain that I have ADHD. Then, again I'm not a doctor so I may be wrong.\n\nIf it's not ADHD, I'm sure it's something", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I'd say it's about 2 inches right of my sternum and is focussed in one small half-inch spot. Most of the time it's not noticeable, but occasionally it flares up for 3-4 days and really hurts, particularly if I press on it. After it was first noticeable, it disappeared after a few weeks for the best part of a year then reappeared. The closest I can describe is that it's like when you have a bad bruise and push on it hard, although there's nothing on my skin to suggest anything is wrong. It doesn't feel very deep below the surface.\n\nI am not sure what specialist to see about this. I saw a gastroenterologist as I was having some digestive issues (cramping, pain and diarrhea after certain foods) and mentioned this in case it was related. Doc isn't sure but ran an ultrasound scan and blood tests. He said there was nothing obvious on the u-s except fatty liver (which I was aware of from previous tests), nothing unusual in the blood test except elevated liver function. I am awaiting further blood results to see if there is likely to be inflammation in my gut, but I think this is unconnected to the pain issue, and the doc seems a bit stumped.\n\nI asked if something like liver cysts or ulcers could be to blame and he didn't seem convinced. He also said there was no sign of gallbladder problems.\n\nHe also suggested I take Nexium for a couple of weeks to try and rule out any acid indigestion issues, I have done this and it hasn't really changed.\n\nWhen this first started up my GP told me it was likely costochondritis, but from everything I've read about this condition it suggests this isn't usually concentrated in one focussed area, and tends to affect upper ribs on both sides or in the centre of the rib cage. This pain is very focussed into a small area.\n\nI don't notice any particular changes to it when I eat. It occasionally seems to flare up if I sit in the same upright position for a while, like on a train or bus.\n\nI would love to hear any suggestions for what this could be and how I can better discuss it with the doctor. Are there any tests that could better narrow down what's happening in that area? Also, advice on whether I'm speaking to the right specialist?\n\nThanks very much.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

For all I know it's been there for years.  \n\nI\u2019m really worried because I can\u2019t think of what caused it. I had a few minor infections over the past several months (a cold 3 months ago, a small gum infection last week) but those infections flared up completely different lymph nodes which resolved , so I don\u2019t see how it could be related.  I do have cystic scalp acne (a dermatologist said it could be recurring folliculitis, but not to treat it if it doesn't bother me), which is the only other possible cause. \n\nFrom where I stand I don\u2019t see how it can be anything other than lymphoma.  Could it be a shotty lymph node maybe? I feel fine otherwise but I\u2019m aware that doesn\u2019t rule out cancer.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I go to the emergency and this is what I know now:\n- they took blood tests and there are no infections\n- the swelling is at the back of the mouth and the throat looks fine (checked with cam through my nose) \n- all my tests was just fine (blood pressure, breathing etc.)\n- my gag reflex became too strong with the swelling so they couldn't test for streptococcus at my tonsils\n\nAlso worth mentioning is that the swelling is the only symptom. No fever, no allergy, no other medicines or illnesses. \n\nI got to swallow betametason medicine with no effect. Also got another pill but I can't remember what it was and can't check it yet, but they said it's used when swelling occurs because of allergic reactions. None of them had any noticable effect.

I have drank milk, eaten cottage cheese, and dairy products all of my life. Sometimes before I go to class in the morning I will have a bowl of oatmeal made with skim milk, which previously has indeed had me going to the bathroom and essentially farting into the toilet. I had attributed that to maybe the fiber in the oatmeal, oh well. On to my point, last night I was having a lovely evening with my SO watching the NBA finals. We had hamburger helper (beef pasta) made with zero milk. At this point I'm feeling groovy and satisfied that the Raptors were winning and my full stomach. My SO comes up with a brilliant idea to go to Braums and get a milkshake over halftime (over an hour after we finished the pasta). I oblige and we get our milkshakes (both larges) and finish the finals game. Almost as soon as I had finished yelling at the Warriors on the tv, and my milkshake, my stomach begins to feel upset. I then attempted to lay down however I simply did not feel comfortable. I wobbled furviously to the toilet thinking I could shit it out but I ended up barfing every single last molecule of food into my poor SO's toilet. Now I'm thinking \"Hey Vusalka , you dummy, you are too much.\" So I cleaned up, drew a bath, and almost passed out in the tub with my acidic throats and painfully empty stomach. As soon as I got up my ass needed to get to the toilet, for the other end. I ended up barbarically blowing out my ass some diarrhea and fart matter about 30 minutes ( I shit you not) until my legs fell asleep and I almost had to crawl to my bed. My question is: does this prove I am lactose intolerant? If not, does anyone know of a legit way to find out without going to a doctor?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Usually they just diagnose me with a sinus infection. But anyway, here's all the info I have.\nAge: 17\nSex: Trans woman, so XY chromosomes but I'm on hormone replacement therapy\nMedications: CURRENT: Estradiol 6mg       daily, Finasteride 5 mg daily\n                           PAST: Sertraline 50-150mg daily, Spironolactone I forgot the dosage, Bicalutamide I forgot the dosage, Abilify I forgot the dosage, Buspar I forget the dosage, Lots of different antibiotics, Flutacosone (FloNase) more times than I can count\nSurgeries: Adenoidectomy and Tonsillectomy when I was 3. Wisdom teeth removal when I was 16. \nOK, time for my symptoms, and this is a long one\nSymptoms: Ear Autophony and pain when exercising (My ears \"pop\" and then the inside of my head and my voice is much louder than the outside, makes it difficult to hear). \nChronic ear pain over the last 3 years that fluctuates in intensity, but is always there.\nFacial pain, swelling, increased temperature, and red rash (kinda in the characteristic butterfly fashion). This fluctuates a lot but flares up rather often. My face gets really hot, red, inflammed and just *hurts*\nChronic headache: I've had a headache for 6 months straight, no joke. it's so awful I would do ANYTHING to make it go away. It fluctuates in intensity a lot, but it always hurts.\nIBS symptoms: diarrhea, constipation, abdominal cramps, nausea, rarely vomiting, indegestion, and bloating. It varies a lot, and I no longer eat dairy because that usually triggers it the most, but it's always there.\nMedicine reactions (at least that's what my doctor told me): When I was 6 weeks on Spironolactone, I burst out into a raised, red, scaly rash on my face, genitals, and elbows, It swelled a lot and was ichy as hell. I went off the med and it went away. I had the same reaction to Bicaluamide. Then when I was on amoxicillin for a \"sinus infection\" when I was about to finish the last few days of the regimen , I had an awful reaction. All of my joints swelled a lot, got really red, and hurt like hell. I got *really* tired and got a rash on my face and other areas. It went away when I stopped the medicine. It's worth noting my doctors and I don't *know* if the meds caused them. They usually happened well after I started the medicines and I was almost always going on and off new medicines in that time frame.\nStrange, powerful, sudden chest pain. It happens less often now, but around once every month or so I will get this horrible tearing pain in my chest for about 15 seconds. And it HURTS so bad. I usually go white and dizzy/lightheaded and start sweating a lot. \nDepression and Anxiety. But this is probably caused by my abusive parents and *horrible* and transphobic school situation. \nI *think* that's everything. It's honestly hard to remember them all anymore.

At first it was just a small red blotch, since then it has gotten bigger and more of a bulls eye look to it. I have assumed it was Lyme Disease from around day 2, because my niece (who lives next door) was diagnosed with Lyme last summer. So day 3 I go into an urgent care near me and tell them I am pretty sure I have Lyme disease. The Dr sees me and says well you didnt find the tick so there is a chance that its not Lyme, does blood work and says it will be 4 days to get results back. She prescribed me Doxycycline mono. 100 mg twice a day for 14 days. she said if the blood test comes back positive she will extend my script for 28 days total. On the way home from the Doctor i started feeling weak and achy. That night I took my first dose of Doxy (with food), later I started having extreme pain, achy all over my whole body and headache, neck pain. I was pretty much just laying in bed at this point. So i call my Doctor let her know what is going on, she says I need to go to the ER just to make sure its not a spider bite. I did not go to the ER. Today is day 5 I feel better pain wise, headache is still there so I called Doc and told her, she just said go to ER. I call ER and they tell me there is nothing more they can do for me that the Doctor has not already done and proceed to tell me they know nothing about bulls eye rashes. So I ask to speak directly to an ER doc, they would not let me \"they are all busy\". So call Doc back and she says we will just have to wait for blood work and if it comes back negative ( I had a specialist tell me it will most likely come back negative since I caught it early) there is nothing they can do for me pretty much. So I guess what my question is, what should I do? wait for blood work they may or may not be accurate? Make an appointment with a specialist? does this look like Lyme disease to everyone? Help!
