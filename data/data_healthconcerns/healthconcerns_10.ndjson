Then one Saturday, the feeling didn't go away all day. I was out with friends and trying to have a good time but it was so distracting and uncomfortable.\n\nI first talked to my primary care physician who said it could be allergies, prescribed Flonase, and told me that if it didn't help I should go see an ENT. Tried it for a month, didn't help so I went to the ENT. He told me that I was probably clenching my jaw and that he couldn't do anything about it. My ears and nose looked perfectly healthy and had no wax buildup.\n\nSo I continued to deal with the few times a week that this feeling would come and go. And then this past weekend the feeling didn't go away all Saturday or Sunday. I was again with friends and trying to enjoy myself and I became so frustrated on Sunday that I broke down crying and the feeling went away for about 2 hours and then it came back.\n\nI saw another doctor right away on Monday. I had a hearing test which came back perfect, he stuck a camera up my nose and saw nothing, also saw nothing in my ears. Told me he can't diagnose me with anything and basically I need to deal with it or go see an allergist or something, just deflecting the problem to another doctor.\n\nAnd so I come to you, Reddit community!\n\nOther details:\n\n\\- I found out recently that if I lean forward so that my head is below or parallel to my chest, the feeling goes away. When I stand up, the feeling comes back. It sometimes feels like a thick fluid is moving and that is why leaning forward makes it clear up. Note - the doctor I saw on monday said he sees no indication of fluid behind my eardrum.\n\n\\- The feeling is sometimes in one ear, sometimes in the other, but usually both at the same time.\n\n\\- When it first started happening, it would just be in the morning, but sometimes in the past (before this issue was persistent) it occurred when I was working out or running.\n\n\\- I do wear a nightguard at night and I have TMJ (jaw pops out of the socket when I open my mouth all the way).\n\nI appreciate any insight and can ask any follow up questions you may have if you can help!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

The main problem at first was my underarms. It didn't matter if I was uncomfortably hot, completely fine or even far too cold, my underarms were constantly soaked. Thankfully I've managed to control this particular issue by use of a strong antiperspirant (which can cause minor skin irritation at times) but issues with the rest of my body have only been amplified.\n\nDuring exercise I start sweating from my back, forehead, underarms and chest almost immediately. After about an hour I'm pretty much soaked head to toe, as if I'd been stood under a shower for about 5 minutes. I've been exercising regularly for about five years and it has never been this bad up until about a year and a half ago. The strange part is I'm not exactly in terrible shape and I figured that as my fitness improved my sweating issues might begin to diminish. This however has not been the case, the problem has only appeared to worsen.\n\nThe main issue is the fact that I get far too hot ridiculously quickly and my body's instant response is to start sweating from all the regions mentioned above. If the temperature outside is 15oC or more, I literally can't even go for a walk without getting uncomfortably hot and sweating excessively as a result. I stopped cycling places because I couldn't stand being soaked whenever I arrived at my destination. I feel as though I can't enjoy any physical/outdoors activity because my body just can't seem to regulate the heat properly. Being consistently soaked in my own sweat, whilst others are completely fine, massively lowers my self esteem and sucks any of the enjoyment out of what I'm doing. I just become paranoid, self conscious and upset.\n\nI don't know if there's a name for this kind of issue but I don't know of any other sufferers and I have no idea if there are any treatments available. If any one else has suffered from this, or something similar to this, and knows of any possible treatments I genuinely can't put in to words how grateful I'd be for your help.

{"post_id": "dcq34o", "created_utc": 1570105150, "title": "Recurrent pneumonia, doctors are mystified", "author": "thatgirlwiththecough", "self_text": "Hi, I'm a 36 year old caucasian woman with 2 children. Before getting into the frequent infections, I just want to say that between each episode I am basically totally healthy. I may have mild IBS (my mom has IBS), but I do not wake up with a cough, and I don't cough daily or while exercising. I've smoked only a couple times in my life, and didn't grow up around smokers. I used to be very athletic, but currently don't do much exercise except for a bit of fun, but nothing intense. I eat a healthy diet, and my BMI is 20.\n\nSo, when I was about 7 I was diagnosed with pneumonia for probably the first time... or at least the first time I remember. It cleared after oral antibiotics, and life went on. But then a few months later I had bronchitis, which cleared with antibiotics. Then I got pneumonia again. And again. I have had bronchitis or pneumonia 2-3 times a year ever since. I grew up without health insurance, and rarely had any tests or x-rays done\u2014they'd just throw me on *Augmentin* (amoxicillin and clavulanate) and send me on my way. As a teen I was told I probably had asthma and was given inhalers, but they never seemed to do anything. I did have frequent air hunger (feeling like I needed to yawn and stretch to get a decent breath), but I never wheezed or had any classic asthma symptoms. Pulmicort was the only inhaler that ever seemed to help with the air hunger, but no one could explain why that was. Even once I had insurance, it seems like I was always seeing a different doctor, so again, doctors would see me, tell me I had bronchitis or pneumonia, give me a z-pack, and send me on my way. When I told them \"this happens every 4 months\" they would act like I must be exaggerating or just say \"yeah that's asthma.\" Sometimes they would put me on daily medications for asthma, but I never noticed any difference and in fact it seemed like using lots of inhalers made my air hunger way worse.\n\nHere's the other weird part: The cough always progresses in the same manner. I get some kind of cold or cough like most people get, but then after a day or two I start having these sudden, extremely intense coughing fits. I feel a tiny tickle in my throat and suddenly I'm down on the ground coughing until I gag, I'm gasping for air, I'm heaving and puking a little, sometimes when I inhale it sounds like a vacuum with something stuck in the hose. These fits are debilitating and last 1-5 minutes. Sometimes they wake me up from a sound sleep, there's no warning it's just BAM I'm coughing like I'm choking to death. I've learned to run and hide and cough into a towel or balled up clothing when these happen, as otherwise people try to call an ambulance\u2014it looks that scary. Sometimes I feel tingly and very sweaty afterward. The coughing fits happen 3-5 times a day and 2-3 times a night for several days. Then it feels like the problem \\*moves down\\*, and I have fewer coughing fits but the cough becomes wetter and deeper. And that's when I usually get diagnosed with bronchitis or pneumonia.\n\nCut to, 2 years ago I moved to an EU country and have been going regularly to a private hospital for my primary care (I have private health insurance). So now there is finally a paper trail, and the doctors here insist on an x-ray to diagnose pneumonia. In the past year alone I've been diagnosed with pneumonia via x-ray 3 times. The last time, it didn't clear with a z-pack and I had to do another antibiotic (don't recall what), plus a nebulizer of steroids.\n\nNow that doctors finally believe me, they want to find the cause. But all my doctors here are mystified.- Spirometry test for asthma: negative, I don't have asthma, though my FEV is on the low side\n\n\\- CT scan of lungs: normal, no bronchiectasis or fibrosis\n\n\\- Skin test for allergies: negative, I have no allergies\n\n\\- Blood labs for immunodeficiency (IgG, IgA, IgM) and autoimmune (tons of stuff, I can't translate it all), white and red cells: all normal, except slightly low vitamin D (which is odd because I live in the Mediterranean and take a daily multivitamin)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only thing that I can think of is maybe when I get a cold it is triggering a laryngospasm or something, and during those frequent spasms I'm aspirating which is causing pneumonia? I mentioned this to a doctor today and she said she'd never heard of that, and that she couldn't imagine I aspirate that frequently and the amount needed to cause pneumonia... I told her she hasn't seen one of my coughing fits.\n\nWe're all at a loss, and I'm so sick of being sick. Hit me with your best shot, please.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Usually I am a top, but will bottom occasionally. Since I have been sexually active I have bottomed only a handful of times. Like most guys I did not really enjoy it at first but more recently have had some pleasurable experiences. I have had quite a few sexual partners in the last year but always use a condom. I have not been tested in a couple of months but am 99% sure I am STD free. \n\nI recently started seeing a guy who is a top. We had not had sex until last night. Not sure if it\u2019s important but he was about average length and a bit thick. It was a little painful at first and we went slow and eventually we were both enjoying ourselves. After a couple of minutes of me being on top of him we switched positions so I was on my back. When we switched positions he came out of me and noticed some blood on his condom. This has never happened to me before but I know it can be normal especially since I have not bottomed in about a year. So he cleaned it up and we resumed. He was going at it pretty hard and it was definitely the roughest sex I\u2019ve had as a bottom. Here\u2019s the weird part- after a couple of minutes of the rough stuff I noticed a small amount of blood coming from my penis. It was pure red blood but only a couple of drops. We immediately stopped obviously and I cleaned myself up (the blood from my penis only got on my own stomach) We were both freaked out and did not continue. I went to urinate and my pee looked normal. It has not and does not hurt to urinate. I have no pain anywhere. \n\nI have a doctors appointment on Monday but I\u2019m still very worried about this. \n\n\nThanks for any information you guys can provide.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

The urine test revealed \"crystals in urine\", and the ultrasound showed nothing. I have had no abdominal pain. My pee seems to hurt less if I am very hydrated, and it hurts to pee even more if I am sitting down.

The pain was localized in one area directly beneath my left breast. At first, the pain was best described as a tightening and mild stabbing along with discomfort everytime I exhaled. I couldn\u2019t lay on my left side or laugh either without pain. The ER doctor performed an EKG and chest X-rays which were both normal. Also, my oxygen was at 100% with normal blood pressure and heart rate.

It feels like my heart is constantly throbbing and the left side of my chest beneath my breast feels completely stuffed and painful. Still no visible swelling or bruising. Ribs do not feel sore to touch. \n\nShort detailed summary:\n\nAge- 18\nSex- Female\nLocation- NY, USA\nMedical History- Slight Anemic\nDuration of symptoms- 10 days \n\nSymptoms- Localized tightening/mild stabbing heart pain under left breast, pain seems to be constant and does not subside with any specific movements, pain worsens with laughter or laying on left side.\n\nNon Symptoms- No coughing, no dizziness, no light headed was, no bruising, no swelling.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I'm seeing a therapist next month, but the thought of it fills me with anxiety, and I don't know how to broach the subject. Part of me worries I'm just playing it up for attention (I'm always paranoid about that.)\n\nSo I thought if I posted my compulsions anonymously I could some unbiased opinions, and maybe get some advice on how to go about it. \n\nHere are my compulsions\n\nMy worst compulsions are ones that kick in when I try to fall asleep. The longest running one is my compulsive need to pee. If I have to pee in slightest, I absolutely cannot fall asleep. And so I have spent hours running back and forth from the bathroom trying to alleviate it. This eventually evolved alongside a hand washing compulsion, so it turned into alternating between trying to pee and washing my hands. I also have a need for silence and darkness. This one comes and goes but when it's bad, I have to use earplugs and a sleep mask to fall asleep. I also got into some bad compulsions last year. I had one where I would repeatedly run my hands down the side of my bed to make sure the mattress hadn't shifted off the side at all. If my hand slipped off even a bit, I had to start over. I also had one where I would compulsively check the time before I went to sleep, and it evolved into me checking the time and my alarm and then reciting in my head the time, the alarm time, and the time till alarm. If I stuttered (in my head) or messed up at all I had to start over again. \n\nI also have some compulsions based on perfecting something. I have one where I'll tap out a phrase with my fingers (I'm a pianist) and then I have to keep doing it until I get out exactly right. This happens at the piano as well. \n\nI also do get some intrusive thoughts. Usually I obsess that other people are judging me over some perceived flaw or something I've done wrong. I also obsess that I will mess something up in a social situation and embarrass myself. I also get intrusive thoughts comparing myself to others, usually relating to music. \n\nI have some other symptoms, but those are primarily the big ones. Should I bring these up when I go to therapy? Is this OCD, or just unrelated compulsions? How can I broach the subject to a therapist?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Any ideas?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Me:**\n\n* 32 year old female, 5'10, obese per BMI measurements\n* Dx with stage 3 Endometriosis in 2009 (laprascopic surgery)\n* Oral Contraception for 10 years before switching to a Mirena IUD (on advice of OBGYN)\n* IUD removed after one year, started on combination pill\n* Paps/pelvic exams normal\n* Told by previous OBGYN that I \"likely\" have PCOS.  No issues with body hair, excessive acne, etc, but have weight issues and current OBGYN concurs with Dx.\n* Work at a desk, fairly sedentary\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**History:**\n\n* My IUD was placed in late July 2018.\n* Constipation issues started within a week of placement; treated with PEG and use of medicated suppositories when it gets especially bad.\n* Pain in lower left groin began approximately Sept 2018.  Pain radiates up through left hip socket area, and on bad days I'll feel it in my lower back/over my hip exterior.  Pain will relieve to a degree when in knees-to-chest position.\n* Pain is sharp - causes goosebumps sometimes.  Radiating pain is a terribly uncomfortable ache; sometimes the ache will go down into my leg (inner thigh as far as my knee) but typically it's limited to the hip/groin/pelvis area.\n* Went to emergency on a particularly bad day in Spring 2019; intravaginal and external US performed, nothing of note.  Blood and urine normal, swabs showed no infection.\n* Returned to OBGYN several times insistant something is wrong; OBGYN feels it's bowel related.  Pointed out that bowels were fine until IUD was placed; did not have any pain in this area prior, either.\n* IUD removed June 2019 per my request.  No hormone/birth control from June until September 11th, bled from end of July through to September 11th.\n* Started Yasmin (combo pill) on September 11th.  Bleeding stopped, daily pain continues.\n* September 19th started bleeding again.  September 20th started bleeding heavier (super absorbant pad is filled within 4 hours).  Continued to bleed heavily (had to get up in the night to change my pad, changed every 3 hrs during the day) from September 20th through to October 6th...  Heaviest period I've ever had.  Walk-in clinic gave 500mg tranexamic acid 3x a day on Sept 30th - took a week to work.  Still bleeding now (Oct 9th) but only during the day, and it's now \"light\".  I have been taking the OC throughout the bleeding, per instruction from medical professionals.\n* During the above-noted period of heavy bleeding, the pain went away.  Completely gone, with only a few \"warning\" twinges that may have been related to the bleeding.  I was elated, and I think I'd have felt better than I had in a year if it wasn't for the lightheadedness/low energy from the weeks of heavy bleeding.   I had long wondered if it's an endometriosis issue, but experience/research tells me that the endo pain is more likely to FLARE during menstruation rather than disappear.\n* As soon as the bleeding started letting up - approx Oct 6th - the pain slowly started returning.  Yesterday I was full-on hurting, and today I'm hurting and experiencing the intense ache radiating all over my left pelvis/hip area.  At it's worst I'd give it a 7 - average is at least a 4 (what I live with daily).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe pain impacts my work, my life, and makes me very emotional sometimes.  Pain/aching does not seem to be correlated to my cycle and/or bowel habits (doesn't feel worse or better after BM - just feels awful all the time).  My OBGYN feels it is a mix of constipation and maybe endo pain, and brushes me off.  A resident working with him checked my anus/rectum (I often feel like I need to go, but my anus can't seem to relax and let the waste out) and all was good \"as far as (she) could reach\".  I have an appointment with a pelvic floor physiotherapist for early February to see if that's what's causing the anus muscle issues.\n\n**My question is regarding the pain and the heavy bleeding.  I'm assuming the bleeding is related to starting on OC again (hormones altered).  What possibly could be at play if the pain let up during heavy bleeding (outside of menstrual cycle), and then returned when the bleeding stopped?  Pain does not relieve during regular menstruation.**  Fibroid?  Cysts?  Tumor? Pinched nerve?  Hernia (no obvious bulges but apparently they can appear differently in women?)?  Nothing was detected on the US in Spring 2019.  \n\nI'm so perplexed.  **If I can find a few reasons as to what this could possibly be, I can present them to my family doctor (and later my OBGYN) to see what their thoughts are.**  We're all seemingly stumped - and OBGYN seems resigned to everything being caused by constipation (which is less of an issue since IUD came out, but pain remains).\n\nAny ideas and suggestions are helpful and appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[EDITS: grammar, formatting\\]", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Only thing noted was stomach physiologically distended due to fluid and gas.* \n* **May**: Ultrasound RUQ:  *Question small stones versus polyps in the neck of the gallbladder. Otherwise,*  \n*negative study.* \n* **June**: Upper Endoscopy: *Mild gastritis, small sliding hiatal hernia. Otherwise clear, biopsy results clear.* \n* **July**: Colonoscopy: *5mm polyp removed, otherwise all clear.* \n* **September**: *Thoracic spine MRI all clear.*\n\nLifestyle changes since March:  Removed dairy, gluten, corn, eggs from diet. Still excluded from diet.   Removed alcohol from diet (was drinking 5-6 drinks a night prior to quitting). Stopped using tobacco. \n\n**Current symptoms:**\n\n1. Low-grade dull pain (1-3 out of 10) left side under ribs daily but colicky, comes and goes throughout the day. Can range from left flank to near sternum, always left side.  Lately do not like sleeping on left side. Seems to be persistent and consistent over time, regardless of dietary/lifestyle choices. \n2. Daily feeling of \u201csomething there\u201d under left rib cage, sort of a pressure or bloat feeling. \n3. Consistent middle/upper back pain that comes and goes in intensity. Not sensitive to touch though.\n4. Back pain brought on, sometimes, by eating. Last night was particularly evident after eating or when feeling the urge to burp... though upon waking back pain gone. Does not disturb sleep.\n5. After endoscopy, for a week, had very bad back pain in middle/upper back area whenever I swallowed anything or had to burp. \n6. After eating a lot, feel as though left side under ribs feels full rather than upper middle abdomen area.\n7. When drinking something cold can feel it seemingly pass through/by the area of discomfort, same with burping or having the urge to burp. \n8. When using a foam roller on back in area of pain, left side abdomen feels very tight.\n\nNo weight loss.  No changes to stool color/frequency.  No change in appetite. Had acid reflex for a while but that is now gone.  Had postprandial fullness but that is also now gone. \n\n**My thoughts:** Maybe all symptoms due to ongoing gastritis or hiatal hernia?  Bile reflux? Discomfort seems to persist and be more evident over time since March.  Is it just gas/poop? Slow gastric emptying? CT scan showed stomach looked distended with gas, could this be related?  Gallbladder causing back pain after eating makes sense but not so much as it relates to left side discomfort.  \n\nWhat are your thoughts?  I am going to book with my gastroenterologist again to continue to pursue answers.  What would make sense next... \n\n* Test lipase/amylase again? Lipase been fine so far though. \n* Gastric emptying test? \n* Abdominal MRI to see if there is an abdominal hernia under ribcage (or anything missed by CT?) \n* Ultrasound left side to see if kidney looks OK? \n* Barium swallow to check small intestine?  \n* Endoscopic ultrasound to rule out potential CT missed something or to look closer at bile ducts?\n* HIDA scan to get a better idea of functionality of gallbladder?\n\nI've recently read that the type of CT scan I got would be 98% reliable in detecting any issues involving PC, chronic pancreatitis, etc.  But I can't help but still think the pancreas is involved somehow due to the location of the discomfort.  Maybe this is all just related to gastritis, hiatal hernia, and gallbladder stones/polyp?   I don't really want to get my gallbladder removed... but will if needed.\n\nAny feedback or guidance you have would be greatly appreciated.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

January of 2017 I had unprotected sex with someone from Turkey, 1 week after our relation my life was never again the same. 5 days after I slept with her I was sitting in my room getting ready to go out with my friends, out of the blue I felt like a truck hit me, I got struck with the a sudden headache that got me thinking am I having a stoke. Ive never ONCE had a headache in my life. I gave it some time but days past, 1 week past and the headache didn\u2019t stop, not for once second. The headaches are constant and relentless, they feel like a burning sensation in my head with random jolts of sharp pain, and it's usually in different spots of my head but it\u2019s mainly a burning feeling on the top with some tightness. Now 2 week after sleeping with her I came down with a sickness that got me the sickest I\u2019ve ever been. I was bed sick for 2-3 months, every bone in my body hurt, I pooped out blood 2-3 times in those 2 months, I pretty much had the exact symptoms of HIV just with no fever. Fast forwarding to around May of the same year I was starting to be able to get active again, being able to play basketball again and even getting back into the gym, but the headaches never went away I had them for every second and still do till this day. My tongue looked like it came out of a horror movie. I just had a list of strange symptoms. 3 weeks after the initial headache I thought she had gave me HIV my symptoms were spot on of that of HIV, even one of the doctors that saw my tongue and heard my symptoms was convinced I had HIV, in the last 3 years I have been tested about 10 times and always came back negative so HIV is definitely not it. I want to say about 2 weeks after we had sex the tip of my penis was super itchy and red and I had white puss coming out, my doctor said you Cleary have an std I don\u2019t need to test you, so he gave me antibiotics pill/ needle which cleared that up in a week. It has been 3 years now and I have the headaches everyday all day, its all around my face my head, its ruined my life, and it just gets harder and harder everyday, theres days where I just start crying because I can\u2019t believe this is my life, my life is pretty much me being in pain all day everyday. I don\u2019t have one second where the headaches stop, I have better days and worst days but the better days are still horrible. Ive been too many doctors and 3 years later im still pretty much undiagnosed. 1 year ago one doctor told me that it is lyme, I came positive for bands present 41, 23 kda B. burgdorferi antibody IgM. I took a lot of antibiotics but don\u2019t feel any different till this day. My main complaint is this ongoing 3 year headache thats ruined me, I still have strange symptoms accompanied with the headaches. I get twitches all through my body, lose my balance a lot even at times when walking, my tongue is still disgusting, the left back side of my throat has had a stabbing sensation the last 3 years also that comes and goes. I have been tested for most STD's and have came up clean and have done alot of blood work where there was really no red flags. I truly believe whatever that has happened to me has happened because I had unprotect sex with that girl. I just want to be normal again because living like this is pretty much not living.

I have been to the health department and was seen by a NP.  I also saw the Dr at the health clinic at the school I attend. Both tested me for the main STD's, which came back negative. They also told me these spots were not warts and they were nothing to worry about. Well, I can't help it. I am worried sick. And no woman is going to want to have sex with me with these spots on my penis. So, I HAVE to figure out what these are, or at least figure out what my next steps should be. I don't understand why these 2 Dr's are acting like it's nothing to worry about because something is obviously wrong. There are about 10 or 15 of these spots on the shaft of my penis and in the pubic area. Can someone please look at these pics and tell me what you think and what I should do? Not asking for a diagnosis. I'm asking for help, opinions, and directions. Thanks.\n\nPS - The white around the spot is from where I was rubbing it with Q-Tips soaked in apple cider vinegar.

This might not be the best place to ask, but I'm unsure what to do. It might not be the tylenol's fault.. \n\nA while back I was pretty sick with a respiratory infection. I took antibiotics and tylenol cold and flu. I was taking the tylenol cold and flu for several days straight at the max dose daily. After that I started having stomach problems (possibly due to the antibiotics) and am still having them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few days ago I ended up in the E.R My blood pressure dropped to what I thought was an unsafe level (105/59 or something, but today it's yoyoing in 90/60 110/68 idk wtf is going on) and my heart started beating really fast. I think anyway... I may have read it wrong. My pulse oximter was reading 149-150. When I was there they never found a reason for the fast pulse. It also slowed down as soon as I got there, typically. I think partially it may have been due to anxiety but I'm unsure. I remember struggling to stay conscious in the car and losing all the feelings in both arms. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe doctors tested me for these things, which evidently came out normal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n.Automated Diff (blood)\n\n.eGFR (blood)\n\nCBC/w Differential (blood) \n\nCMP(blood) \n\nEKG (it says Palpitations but..) \n\nUrinalysiis Reflex Microscopic \n\nUrine Drug Screen 11A (i was not on drugs) \n\nThey also took a stool sample, no word on that yet\n\nFor the past few days I had taken Migraine pills.

I thought that the Migraine pills might have caused issue; i had drank coffee that day, and drank pepsi zero, which has caffine, and taken a caffinated pill...so I stopped taking them. I thought if I get a headache, I'll take acetaminophen.  For 3 days now I have taken just extra strength acetaminophen; two extra strength tablets, once daily. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I took that, but then I realized I was still getting similar symptoms. Dizziness, feeling faint, sick to my stomach, diarrhea. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was sort of worried about liver damage this whole time, because of all of the acetaminophen. I have been keeping an eye on my eyballs and don't see any yellow but I don't know if that would be relevant. Today, I had taken more acetaminophen and felt really sick. Dizzy, my muscles hurt, I feel exhausted. My stomach still hurts, still nauseated. I started worrying more about liver damage because for a while when I went to the bathroom it was semi normal consistency but kind of light colored. Like tan, not as dark as usual. Lately it has been either floating and mucousy, bad smelling, and sometimes really loose or diarrhea like. Sometimes it's only mucous. Sometimes it's blood and mucous.

Lowgrade but sick feeling nonetheless. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm worried that I might be messing my liver up and I don't know what to take, now. I don't want to deal with this fever especially if it gets higher. Is acetaminophen making me sick? If my liver was damaged, could I take ibuprofen or naproxen? Is my liver damaged? I'm not trying to go back into the ER again after I got kicked out with no diagnosis last time and it's costing me a fortune...  They put 'Adenovirius' on my papers but idk..

One night, I had a hand tremor, which I have never had before, and was unable to control. Was present bilaterally. I thought maybe I had not eaten in a while, so I ate dinner that evening, and felt better.\n\nHowever, the next day, I began to feel worse. That evening, I felt feverish and began having trouble urinating entirely. I also began having pelvic pain at that point, as well as a burning/shooting nerve type pain in the left side of my penis, though no markings at all were present. I never ran an actual, measurable fever, and my temperature was consistently around 98 degrees, and usually lower.\n\nOver the next few weeks, muscle twitching began, first in my perineum, which would clench rather hard. This often caused unwanted persistent, semi-painful erections at night.\n\nOver the course of a few weeks, the muscle twitches and spasms have spread to the entirety of my body - arms, legs, and face. Though the legs are by far the worst. Additionally, on occasion during this, my skin has felt incredibly sensitive, much as it does when you have a fever. I believe the name for this is allodynia.\n\nIn addition to the muscle twitching, I seem to have a bit of a 'sway', and feel my trunk sort of unconsciously moving side-to-side. This also happens with my head, though it's less pronounced. Sometimes, I will feel a bit of a sudden, involuntary jerk, and will almost jump as if startled, though less severe than that. From time-to-time, I have also had flushing on my face, that crosses the bridge of my nose, though it tends to go away rapidly.\n\nI often also have some perceived weakness in my legs, and my knees feel as though they may buckle when going down stairs. I also had some allergy-type symptoms during this time, but I have had them before. These include diffuse eye redness across the sclera, post-nasal drip, and chapped lips.\n\nI have also had a sharp or pressure pain in my abdomen, right below the ribs, sometimes one side, sometimes centered, sometimes bilateral. Sometimes persistent, sometimes only when I breathe deeply. Lastly, I have had some itching, though there is no visible rash or irritation at any time, nor has there been.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring the course of this, I have been prescribed the following:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Ciprofloxacin 500mg/2x day for suspected Prostatits\n\n\\- Bactrim due to tendinitis in arm/hand while on Ciprofloxacin. Discontinued when muscle twitching became severe.\n\n\\- Alprazolam to help with anxiety caused by twitching\n\n\\- Ergocalciferol 50,000 IU (Deficiency was discovered as a result of tests below.)\n\n\\- Sertraline (Anxiety)\n\n\\- Prednisone pack (Allergies)\n\n\\- Baclofen (Muscle Spasms, weakness, soreness)\n\n\\- Levocetirizine (Allergies)\n\n\\- Gabapentin\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Baclofen has helped my twitching a bit, but still occurs. Gabapentin (Which I was not prescribed, but had and took... I know I shouldn't.) also seems to help. The prednisone seems to have fixed the allergy problems.\n\nI have had the following tests - some were due to the origin of the symptoms in the genital area, obviously. All repeat tests are two months apart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2x CBC: months apart: Normal on all counts.\n\n2x Vitamin D: Deficiency, then normal.\n\n2x Magnesium: Normal\n\n2x B12: Normal\n\nB1: Slightly elevated\n\nHIV Gen4 1/2 + p24 ELISA: Negative\n\nHIV Gen3 PoC: Negative\n\nRPR: Negative\n\nHSV 1/2 ELISA: Negative\n\nGonorrhea NAAT: Negative\n\nChlamydia NAAT: Negative\n\nUrinalysis: Normal\n\nUrine Culture: Negative, no growth\n\nTSH: Normal\n\nPSA: Normal\n\nC-Reactive Protein: Normal\n\nCreatine Kinase: Normal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe initial thought was anxiety was causing the symptoms, as I had high-stress times in my life recently. However, I have had this under control for some time, and no improvement has been made in the symptoms, only my interpretation and dealing with them. I have had no imaging at this time.\n\nI'm curious as to what this points to, if anything obvious at all.

Sometimes flu-like symptoms.\n\nI started with menorrhagia on Thursday all day. On this day, I was in no pain and did not feel weak in any way. The next day, menorrhagia ended but I felt tired, light-headed, and my heart would beat fast all of sudden. I googled the symptoms and anemia came up which made sense because of the menorrhagia. I immediately went to go get iron tablets which I took for 3 days. I already take b12 vitamins on a daily because I don't eat meat. I also spent the next few days in bed, drinking mostly gatorade (since I thought I was dehydrated.) I also drank vit c drinks daily since I read it helped with the absorption of iron. On Sunday, I started to get pelvis/lower back pain and a cluster headache. It was bad enough that I couldn't sleep.\n\nOn Monday, I went to urgent care. The doctor checked my blood, urine, and did a sonogram. He said my hemogoblins were slightly low but within margin (not anemic.) He thought I might have an ovarian cyst but sonograms came out clear. He gave me a shot for the pain and told me to rest for 2 days and gave me a note for work. I rested that day and worked from home the next. He said he ruled out deficiencies, infections, and cancers. I should mentioned I stopped with iron and vit C since I found out it wasn't anemia. \n\nHowever, on Tuesday my cluster headache returned and ibuprofen didn't even take the edge off. I also had a sore throat and I'm assuming I caught something from being in urgent care all day. The sore throat only lasted through Tuesday and some of Wed.\n\nWednesday I was in pain all day from the headache.  I went and got Excedrin but that also didn't take the edge off. Finally, a heat pack on the back of my head and sometimes on my abs (they were still in pain) helped. I skipped school again and slept in hoping that would help as well. \n\nThursday, still dizzy. I felt tingling in my head so I made sure to eat right away and take Excedrin since a few migraine sufferers told me prevention was key. Still drinking gatorade but mostly water. I have an appointment with my primary care doctor but not for another week.

I have a cat allergy that usually manifests as itchy  eyes/sneezing, so I'd been doing immunotherapy (SLIT) for 6 months to  prepare for this.  We decided we'd keep the cat in the main living area  and keep the bedroom off limits.  We also got a couple of  high-end air  purifiers, and took a few other precautions as recommended by my  allergist.\n\nI also started taking  Xyzal 2 days before the move-in.  I figured that'd help.  After about 5  days I had heart palpitations &amp; a panic attack, which are Xyzal  symptoms (I have never had palpitations or panic like that before).  I  immediately quit Xyzal and went to Flonase/Allegra, my combo for allergy  season in the past 2 years.\n\nAround that time I started having a pretty intense headache.  Symptoms include:\n\n\\- pain above my eyes on both sides, and in the center of my forehead\n\n\\- pain my teeth (esp. in morning)\n\n\\- sometimes there is eye pressure / my vision gets a little blurry\n\n\\-  The pain ranges from a 1/5 (annoying) to a 5/5 (hard to get anything  done, I have to lay down).  I'm not used to headaches like this.\n\nThis has persisted for 2+ weeks, essentially every day, it is getting to be a real obstacle to doing things I need to get done.\n\nBecause  I'd never had symptoms like this from any of my other allergies, I was  worried it was another medicine side-effect (Flonase can cause  headaches) so I went off medicine for 3 days.  No real change, but a  little stuffier than usual.  At this point I noticed that my usual cat  allergies were not nearly as noticable (maybe b/c of the immunotherapy)  but went back on Allegra for a while to see if it'd help with the headaches.  The headache persisted, but I assumed it was allergy related still.\n\nThen,  I went out of town for 2 days.  I had a headache the entire time, with nothing that the cat had come into direct contact with on me  (clothes/etc. stored in the bedroom that hadn't been worn around the  cat).  This led me to wonder if it wasn't something else after all, but  medicine doesn't seem to be the culprit unless it is a delayed/continued  reaction from any of them.\n\nI  talked to my allergist, and he (without really looking at me) said it  was a sinus infection &amp; put me on antibiotics.  I'm 2 days in, and  taking them, but no real changes yet and now I have a headache and  stomach ache, making work difficult.  I've read a lot online that sinus  infections are over-diagnosed, so I'm hoping to get a second opinion.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I traveled to Nashville after, and there I noticed when I started to get a little hot, my clothes were becoming pretty itchy. The sensation carried on there even after I cooled down and wasn't wearing a shirt anymore.\n\nWhat I have been dealing with since then is a sensation somewhere in between itchy, scratchy, and prickly. It isn't what I would normally consider itchy, probably closer to something prickly and scratchy. When I walk in pants, it feels something like someone has put hay in them and its scratching my legs as I walk.\n\nThings that cause me to feel it more\n\n* Wearing pants\n   * especially ones that are tighter/slimmer\n   * Walking in pants, because it causes the pants to rub on my legs\n   * Sitting down makes them get tighter, so same effect\n* Certain fabric T Shirts\n   * Shirts with more of a smooth feel rather than soft, feel the least itchy\n* Driving/sitting in a car\n   * I think this is because it makes the clothing fabric press into my skin more, which makes it feel prickly/itchy\n* Starting to workout\n   * I can feel pretty intense pins and needles prickling on my face from this\n* Getting hot not working out\n* Taking hot showers\n   * If I take a hot shower at night, my skin can tend to be more irritated the next day\n* Thinking about it/being irritated by clothing\n   * This can make me notice it more. As I've been trying to figure it out and think about it tonight I notice it more, especially in my face\n\nSo while I feel it a lot on my legs where my pants touch and shirt when it's pressed into me, I can also feel it all over my body. My face happens to be feeling it right now pretty strong. I also recently moved from Florida to Oregon. I think the cold might be making it worse. Also I recently started a job so I'm wearing pants all day, so it might be that that's making it worse.\n\nI've been to a dermatologist and an allergist. The dermatologist didn't offer much help. The allergist tested me for common allergens and nothing came back positive and though I might have contact dermatitis.\n\nAround this same time, my eyes started to become drier. I went a summer just wearing contacts with my eyes being pretty dry. Now, I mainly wear glasses and occasionally contacts. My eyes are still pretty dry and hurt. I probably need to take better care of them.\n\nTo me, my skin doesn't feel dry. I've tried putting on lotion a few times, but it didn't seem to make a difference. I am considering buying some eczema lotion and trying that. I don't notice any rashes or skin discoloration either. I am using a natural body wash and natural detergent when washing my clothes.\n\nAny help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I'm not sure what I can do at this point.

We've been brought up by abusive and neglectful parents. I'm diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, he's supposedly diagnosed with ADHD. Our mother is most definitely mentally ill, grandfather has been taking anti-depressants for 2 decades and our great uncle was diagnosed with bipolar-schizophrenia. For many reasons I don't think all these mental health issues are correctly diagnosed, but you get the point that my family is not the most mentally healthy on the block. I'm pretty much only asking this for my curiosity, because there's no way treatment will happen unless it's court ordered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRelevant symptoms and behaviour starting from 8 months ago:\n\n* Aggression. Started when he was 5 and would hit and curse at teachers. Waned for a bit until he turned 14 and grew 100 times more serious and frequent when he turned 15. It's more than aggression it's violence. He's broken countless objects including his 2 phones and his computer, assaulted his parents numerous times, cannot control his voice pitch and picks arguments every single day. From his words he clearly wants revenge against our parents for everything they've done to us, but sometimes I can see that he's truly can't control an impulse and implied so himself. At one point he insisted on needing psychiatric medication to control himself.\n* Substance abuse. His friends convinced him to try cigarettes and he smoked for 2 months (ok not that big of a deal depending how you look at it) . But then he started taking stealing the strong painkillers from our medicine cabinet and wouldn't say why.\n* Sleep disturbances. Often sleeps incredibly late, close to midnight, but regardless at what time he sleeps he almost always wakes up at around 11 in the morning if he has no commitments. Often, he wakes up a few hours after going to sleep to raid the fridge. On some nights he creepily paces in his room.\n* Not impacted by punishments. Nothing gets through to him, not talking it through, not limiting his finances (he has no job) not even kicking him out of the house for our own safety. All the time he spent without his computer and without his phone with no other way to entertain himself, he just stared at the ceiling for hours on end. Did not even pick up a book, though he's always been disinterested in reading.\n* Almost delusional thinking. Initially I passed off his reasoning as just normal teenage hard-headedness coupled with having to be around shitty parents. But the way he talks and his opinions are seriously starting to scare all of us. He makes connections that are quite unrelated and he can't see the logic of why they are unrelated. He thinks in such cut and dry, black and white terms yet accuses everyone else of doing it instead. He starts arguments and when given answers strays very far away from the point. He picks arguments over the very same thing and brings up the same points even though we've been through with discussing them. Have you ever watched some of Jordan Peterson's interviews? Where a social justice warrior unfairly accuses him of claiming \"are you saying all woman are X?!\" when he made no such claim at all? My brother acts in that accusatory way every time he speaks.\n* His borderline delusional opinions. To be fair he had some pretty shitty friends a few months ago that influenced him in bad ways, but he always gloats he's over them. He's obsessed with wearing 'trendy' clothes and doing 'trendy' things even if they're insanely expensive. If his parents weren't in control of his finances he would definitely be spending them irresponsibly. He thinks if you're not 'trendy' you're an antisocial and worthless nerd. Also his definition of a 'worthless antisocial nerd' is very scattered and exaggerated. He thinks bullying is justified and actually needed, only revoking that opinion for the physically disabled. He runs off of stereotypes many times and just makes connections that are just so out there. For example he equates everyone with ASD as socially inept, incredibly annoying and insufferable, and gay, weirdly enough. He claims this entire country is full of immature idiots because only about 20% make it to a university. He keeps justifying his immature and irresponsible behaviour as just normal for our country and especially as something that teens just do, and thinks teens naturally just want to overspend and party all day. He claims all people in the real world share his mindset and that we are out of touch and delusional.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

The itchiness comes and goes, but it is the type of itchiness that you get from bug bites (where scratching or rubbing it brings relief but makes me want to rub it harder). The dead skin comes off on a q-tip when I use one after a shower and it shows up as small white rolls and/or clumps. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s dead skin, anyway.

The pain starts localized on one side and then, as my period becomes closer, the pain extends all over my lower abdomen and lower back. This pain has been extremely abnormal for me and it goes away once my period is over (until I start ovulating again). I originally suspected an ovarian cyst so I went to an urgent care clinic in July, where they ran blood and urine tests. There was no sign of a UTI/bladder infection nor STDs, so I was referred to the hospital for imaging. I was treated by a first year resident doctor at the hospital, who conducted a pelvic exam and then told me nothing wrong with me and I was most likely having a bad period.\n\nGiven that I am still having this abnormal pain, I am concerned that this is something worse than a \"bad period.\" Is it possible I have an ovarian cyst? Would you see this in a pelvic exam? My experience in July made me feel so embarrassed and violated so I have fears about going back to see a doctor about this.\n\nHere is some info about me that I saw might be useful to include in this post: 21 yr old caucasian female, \\~5'3\", \\~120lbs, meds= adderall and occasional evening hydroxyzine for sleep (I was on birth control for about 4 years, but stopped taking it a year ago), pain can be dull around a 4-5/10 for most days but the first few days of my period I have sharp pain that is more of 7-8/10, I currently only have one sexual partner who is FTM (thus no change of pregnancy/STDs since I was tested in July).

Bloating and burping follow. It is like my brain sends a signal to my stomach and it just turns its back on me right at that time. I have never puked but I have almost been there countless times. Although, I usually eat a moderate portion of my food, I never quite finish meals easily. This worsens when I am at social gatherings or restaurants. Just before taking a bite, nausea hits me; in fact, I have stopped going to restaurants to try out food fearing always that it would get uncomfortable, which it does. It just creeps me out. Food loses its deliciousness after a few bites. A kind of psychological blockade.\n\nMy appetite has been very low but once in a while, I do finish a meal as a famished person does, but I am never eager to eat a bite more or lick the spoon.\n\nBreakfasts suck. Even a cup of coffee makes me full. Again, sometimes, if I am lucky I do enjoy it.\n\nI used to love sweet foods, but now I can't have much of them. Make me crave water quickly.\n\nMy weight has been near-constant, &gt;50&gt;53. I do wanna gain more, but by eating enough and healthy, though.\n\nNo long-lasting diarrhea or constipation. Mild discomfort in mornings but nothing too acute.\n\nI have been to several doctors and am currently undergoing treatment. Past doctors have treated it as GERD (I did have acidity, but that wasn't the primary problem) and the current one is giving me a preliminary treatment for giardiasis just to make sure it isn't that, and I don't think it is. He says we will look for gastric/gut motility and indigestion next. Ran some tests but everything was normal, just low folic acid level.\n\nThe worst part I guess is that I feel generally nervous around food, it feels like a project ESPECIALLY when I eat out and the hinderance it has created for me to gain weight. Food is never an incentive for me to go anywhere.\n\nAlso, if something is upsetting me, I kinda redirect it to my food. Minor mood swings make me think of how it will make my lunch or any other meal suck. I don't think I have depression but I'd say I am generally a more nervous person which has compounded with how my relationship with food is.\n\nAnd I have late breakfast and my meals aren't timely but almost regular.

This also made my whole right leg feel weird and lasted an entire month then went away.\n\nIn August the twitching started to spread to left calf and then arms, right forearm and upper arm muscles on both sides of body. Occasionally in my pelvic area and since then into my thighs and just above my kneecap. I googled symptoms and this didn't help.\n\nIn late August my left calf started to feel strange and twitch at night, to present it still feels uncomfortable to lay flat on a bed with leg resting on it straight. Twitching intensified.\n\nIn September to current my left arms started feeling fatigued/weaker in upper arm. No consistent twitching but it happens at times and especially after use. I can still throw football and pick things up, no clinical weakness per looking up stuff with that. I can still stand on toes and heels and haven't fallen or dropped anything.\n\nSmall issues during this time: sore throat often with no cough, rib/chest pain that lasted two weeks and went away, a couple short fevers and some difficulty thinking/focusing at times. No known tick bite or rash. Lyme test only showed p41 igg. \n\nThoughts?\n\nTLDR: twitching, joint creaking, fatigued, can't sleep, muscle pain and weird soreness that moves at times.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Then I noticed they had stopped\u2026. I thought awesome!\n\n\nAt the end of August I had an anxiety attack like no other, it was very odd and 10X worse then normal, I went to ER they sent me away said there was nothing they could do.\n\n\nWeek later it happens again and I again go to different ER where they do take it seriously but have no conclusion. When I was there for 12 hours, and it was hell, my nerves and brain felt like they were hyper stimulated and raw\u2026. The whole time I had no anxiety attack which I would have thought would happen. (When I scare myself, in house, driving, etc.. and you would nornally get the racing heart, which now never comes)\n\n\nI have been to ER again and same thing, no results. They have put referals into Endocrinology, Neurology, and Internal Medicine (the guys that take care of the odd cases)\n\n\nI have now had 3 \u201creal anxiety attacks\u201d the good old kind, but this has only started due to my taking vitamins and minerals to support my adrenals\u2026.. Today Thanksgiving I took 2 large smoothies 9AM and Lunch loaded with spinach which has lots of good stuff for adrenals and hour later out for walk had a good old anxiety attack, then I had about \u00bd a one\u2026 and now am having more but can not sense them well\u2026 you sort of know but its vague.\n\n\nSo there is either something wrong with the adrenals or I just plain ran out of adrenaline.\n\n\nLeaves me in a very bad place. WIthout adrenaline I can not sense I am having a normal attack until it has gone awhile and loaded my body with all sorts of other hormones that give me the big weird attack, if the big attack does not come it leaves you shakey, dizzy, and have little cognition, you can feel nerves all over your body almost zapping under the skin. If the adrenaline was there I would have the pounding heart, and thus could deal with attack and learn to stop them again\u2026 but with no signs there is nothing to stop.\n\n\nI think also due to the fact the anxiety attacks are flying under the radar unchecked it has made them much more easy to occur and the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response is almost permanently turned on.\n\n\nI just had a visit with Riverside Hospital Internal Medicine guys and they came up with nothing, unfortunately I had not definitively figured it out at that point which as only 3 days ago\u2026..\n\n\nI did do a test a week ago for 24 hour urine to test for a marker of Adrenal tumour.

Please help me \ud83d\udc99", "author": "Miss_Psynchrony", "self_text": "Hi,\n\nI've been living with the symptoms I'm about to list for about 2 years now. I've been to 4 different doctors now, they both had different opinions on what I have - none of which helped better my life... I am now out of my country and my travel insurance isn't ready to be used yet and I'm so done waiting because it only gets worse. So I figured I'd try this subreddit. (This is my second pair here, the first was in another subreddit and didn't receive any help.)\n I'd be so grateful for you guys' help! So here we go, I'll try to be clear and concise.\n\nSymptoms:\n- frequent urination, weak stream, small amount each time\n- feel a pressure on my pelvic/bladder area pretty often throughout the day\n- needle feeling in my bladder as soon as there's a few drops inside of it\n- excessive vaginal wetness, to the point of not having any sensation at all anymore during sex from both me and my partner, no friction at all (even without forplay and desire, it's a river down there...)\n- vaginal discharge are odorless and very watery, translucent in color most of the time, sometimes white-ish, always very liquid though \n- frequent lower back pain\n- fatigue\n- pain felt at the cervix during intercourse\n- difficulty emptying bladder\n- blood spotting in between periods\n\nBackground:\n- Did general STDs test a year ago, I was clean of everything\n- I never used birthcontrol up until 3 weeks ago, I now have a IUD\n- All these symptoms started around 2 to 3 years ago\n- I don't use condoms, my partner is clean (he was checked a month ago for everything)\n- I often change of brands when it comes to feminine hygiene products \n- I mostly wear cotton underwear \n- I'm vegetarian\n- Don't have diabetes\n- I did get an infection (STD) about two years ago (can't remember if it was Chlamydia or Gonorrhea) and it got cured easily since\n\nThat's all I can think of... I got used to the bladder issue over time, to be honest what makes me suffer is how my sex life has been destroyed. Not being able to enjoy a normal life with my partner at such a young age is depressing and heartbreaking. And I can feel this isn't normal, something is wrong and I am insanely frustrated about the fact no one can find out what's wrong with me. I'm pretty desperate... \n\nAs for the past doctors theories -\n1. The first doctor would say it's all in my head, she didn't even do any test at all... She advised me to \"chill\". I'm pretty relaxed honestly, so...\n2. Second doctor said I probably have a tiny bladder and advised me to hold it in when I need to pee as long as possible... I followed his instructions and it didn't change anything except for the fact I could hold it in a little longer... \n3. I went to a third Dr recently because of severe bladder pain, and she tested me for UTI, it came back positive so she treated me for UTI and guess what... The severe pain went away yes, but all other symptomes remained and my Leucocytes levels are still abnormal...\n\n\nThanks in advance for anyone who will try and help me figure this nightmare out!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

It started out with my parents going off to vacation for two weeks, right before they left I started my couch hopping journey for the next two and a half weeks. I couldn't stay at home due to us living 1 and a half hours away from my school and I'm dependent on my mom and stepdad for transportation. A week after they left I came back and had to pick up some things, and when I went into my room I saw that my closet was cleaned. This was very very weird as it is a mess and I hide some teenager things in there (stuff I would really rather not have my mom seeing) mostly just an embarrassing amount of trash but also beer cans and liquor bottles and also snus(A nordic nicotine thing) that I having gotten rid of from when I had some friends over. So my conclusion was that my mom had cleaned it out. I decided that I wouldn't confront my mom on what was in there. But here is the twist, two weeks after they had returned I was cleaning my room and I went into the closet to get a broom and to my utter surprise the closet was exactly as dirty as before my mom had cleaned it. So what this means is that my mom never cleaned my room and I had hallucinated the whole thing....\n\nOk seriously while writing this, I have completely forgot what the other thing was, which is super fucking weird because I almost had a panic attack when this happened. Seriously don't know what the fuck is going on with my memory. Once I remember ill edit the post.

A few years ago, I developed depressive symptoms and feel almost a bit disassociated from my body (nothing has worked, and I assume it is psychological). It's like the feedback mechanism is off, and it has really affected my appetite--I don't get very hungry most of the time, but when I do, I feel no different. No better after eating. Not even very different. I'm generally kind of bloated and it almost feels like everything is on a delay---suddenly, my stomach/intestines will start growling like crazy and moving around--it is really audible, but not painful. \n\nMore recently, I started having daily but not constant tension in my chest and esophagus, but not like a panic attack or painful or anything. I can breathe fine, although sometimes it does feel like I can't inhale and exhale all the way, and there is no choking. It is just uncomfortable in a way that is hard to explain, and generally there isn't a noticeable trigger. And my throat will start fluttering really badly, and sometimes make a clicking noise. Sometimes this happens more when I try to focus, and break the dissociation mode, which may mean it is a nervous tic. But it is just insanely weird to look at. I'm a 30-year-old-woman, but it is like an adam's apple going crazy. I have no ability to stop any of this while it is happening--it is involuntary, almost like I'm trying to brace against something. If this happens for a few minutes, it seems to straighten out and I feel better. Usually i start burping like I've swallowed air, and my stomach starts growling--it's like the air is moving around in there all wrong. If I speak for any period of time, the tension/spasms also stop. But I just feel chronically out of whack, like the energy in my body is somehow bouncing around in the wrong place. Reading about diaphragm spasms, that seems probably  to be at least one of the culprits here with the pressure and movement---a vague but unsettling physical discomfort that seems to disrupt all my thoughts and leave me feeling ungrounded. It's like when I try to think, something seizes up and blocks completion of the thought, but I can't identify what is going on enough to try and address it. What bugs me is that at this point I don't know what a baseline state is, so I never know how worried to be. I dismiss it as in my head. But the throat spasms are very visible, and I had originally thought they were in my head. I can't find much about what causes them, and they don't seem to be a common tic--there is a genetic condition that one of my cousins had, affecting digestion, that I was sure might be the culprit, but I had an endoscopy and was more than relieved to find nothing serious.

Please ask if there is any other relevant information you need!\n\n* Age: 32\n* Sex: F\n* Location: NYC area\n\nThe issue is her reaction to bug bites. We think they are mosquito bites, but not confirmation. For a year or so, she has had some bug bites turn into big red welts. I know this isn't entirely unusual and we've heard as much from the medical professionals we have seen.\n\nThe unusual bit is that we've had to take her to the hospital for the last two bites because they began streaking up her extremities. The first time that happened, she was bitten on the bottom of her foot and there was streaking up her leg. The second time (about a month ago and only \\~ weeks after the first visit) the bite was on her finger and there was streaking up her arm. Last night she had a bite on her finger and is beginning to see streaking on her hand which leads me to believe we'll need another hospital visit.\n\nWe sleep in the same bed and I very rarely get bitten - I don't even remember the last bug bite I had. This is also why I think they are mosquito bites since I've read they can be particular about who they bite. I think things like bed bugs would be biting the both of us if that was the case.\n\nDermatologist doesn't know what it is. Our primary care doctor is equally baffled. We're going to see an allergist, but she responds to the clindamycin (antibiotics) that they give her, both in an IV (at the hospital) and orally at home. The doctors have said it's likely not an allergy or she wouldn't have responded to the antibiotics.\n\nAny information on what this could possibly be or even what kinds of specialists we should consult would be great!\n\nThe few pics I have on my phone: [https://imgur.com/a/76iUqJz](https://imgur.com/a/76iUqJz)\n\ntl;dr: Wife gets bug bites.

My lips are always painfully dry and cracked as well.\n\nPictures: https://imgur.com/a/06EVBPD\n\nMy scalp stopped producing oil, and is always dry and flaky, along with my hair which has started falling out, become thinner, and has changed texture completely(for the worse).\n\nBefore:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/xYQLZ53\n\nAfter:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/SmJXkii\n\nI also have bouts of feeling severe depression and hopelessness, to the point where I just feel like randomly crying, and many of the things which made me happy before fail to do so now.\n\nI went to my doctor and dermatologist about these random symptoms, but they just brushed it off and claimed that its \u2018in my head\u2019 or something.\n\nIt isn\u2019t any other underlying health concern, as I got blood work done recently and everything was perfectly normal (blood sugar, thyroid, vitamins/mineral level).

I was told on 3 separate occasions (over 8 years) that I have hypothyroidism when I was hospitalized (hospitalizations were for random stuff that's probably not relevant). My mom, grandma, and great-grandma all have hypothyroidism, so I figured my untreated thyroid was causing my symptoms--high resting heart rate (95-110bpm) that sometimes races (as high as 150bpm) for seemingly no reason, light headedness/vertigo that sometimes causes me to faint, almost daily hot flashes with extreme nausea (sometimes vomiting) that last for about a minute or less, hair falling out, fibrocystic breast disease, etc. \n\nI don't know why I just nonchalantly assumed it was my thyroid. However, I just had an actual thyroid panel done, and the endocrinologist said my thyroid looks good. She thinks I have tumors on my adrenal glands, so she ordered a bunch of tests. \n\nShe says if they come back normal, then it's all just because of my anxiety. She said antidepressants would help me even though I'm not depressed because they are non-habit forming and reduce anxiety. I do get some social anxiety, but it's not debilitating by any means. I've never been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder or medicated for anxiety. I don't feel like my anxiety could be causing me to pass out or cause my heart to race when I don't even feel stressed out about anything at the moment it's happening. \n\n\nI'd really rather not take antidepressants just because I don't think I need them. But I'm not a doctor by any means, so I guess I'm just wondering if this could really be my anxiety and/or if I should just take the antidepressants if my doctor tells me I should. Honestly, I'd rather it be my anxiety if the alternative is a tumor... but I just want to be sure I get diagnosed/medicated correctly.\n\n\nEDIT: \nHere are the tests my doctor ordered that I will have done Friday, if that provides any useful information. \nCMP, adrenocorticotropic hormone blood, CBC with differential, vitamin D screen (I was told I'm deficient and she wants to check if I can reduce my dose of vitamin d), cortisol level, metanephrines (fractioned, free, blood)", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Or if they really think it was just a panic attack. Again, definitely going to a doctor, but I wanted to know if it's actually likely that this really was just a panic attack, even though I rarely experience panic attacks, wasn't panicking until after it occurred, and never have experienced anything like this when I DO have them.\n\n* Age: 24\n* Sex/Gender: Female\n* Height and weight: 5.4, 220 lbs\n* Race/Ethnicity: White\n* Geographic location: US\n* Pre-existing medical issues (if any): Depression, anxiety (but NOT panic disorder), slight anemia, had a double oophorectomy\n* Current medications: Paroxetine, Estradiol (supposed to have Medroxyprogesterone too but need a new script)\n* Duration of complaint (how long has this been happening): Lasted about 7 minutes. Has happened before very slightly when ill but always went away within minutes and was never this severe.\n* Symptoms: One morning on the way to work I was feeling anxious and nauseated. The anxiety wasn't horrible, and definitely wasn't a panic attack. About twenty minutes into the ride, almost to work, I realize that I'm having trouble moving my hand. I start breathing deeply and try to keep moving it so blood can get to it, but after about a minute I realize I can't move it at all, or my other hand, or my feet. About the only thing I can do is flap my arms like a chicken. It's super uncomfortable, horrible pins and needles and feels like someone keeps winding a spring (except the springs are my limbs).\n\nAt THIS point I panic. I start calling \"I can't move!\" out and realize that I'm having difficulty talking, too. My words are slurred, and I can't talk very loudly. A lovely man opened the windows for me, and a wonderful woman asked the driver to call 911 and fanned me with the book I was reading. After a few minutes of not being able to move my arms or legs (couldn't bend my legs either), I feel everything loosening. It starts with my hands, then my mouth, then feet. This happens just before we get to the bus, and EMTs arrive. I have been totally conscious this whole time, and slightly terrified I was having a stroke. At this point I feel scared and very shaky but otherwise okay. I was able to walk onto the stretcher.\n\nThey took me to the hospital. My blood pressure on the way there was something like 150/96, but it went down to 126/80. They took some blood and gave me an IV (I was a bit dehydrated). They told me all the blood tests came back normal, but when I went home I saw that my basophil level was .7 and that was lower than what the paper they gave me showed me it should be. (I think it said 1.4 was normal? I don't remember where I put my chart right now.) My doctor told me the reason I couldn't move my limbs was because I panicked and hyperventilated, and so too much carbon dioxide entered my extremities and prevented oxygen from entering, preventing me from being able to move them. I told them I take Paxil and they automatically assumed I had anxiety and apparently panic disorder, even though I didn't tell them that. I told her I've never had a panic attack feel like this, and she said I needed to go to a doctor rather than the ER because they only deal with \"emergent conditions.\" Which I get; I'm sure you're super busy and other patients need you far more than me, but can you act like you care any less? Now I know why that hospital's called the Chop Shop.\n\nThis happened about two weeks ago and hasn't occurred since; just trying to save money for the copay for the doctor. I mostly want to know: could a panic attack really cause this? Do you think that's likely? I'm going to have a doctor check me out either way, I just feel a bit like I wasted everyone's time because they were so dismissive of me at the hospital. But every instinct (and everyone else I've talked to) screams to get a second opinion. I feel ridiculous for posting here because it's either a panic attack or something far outside Reddit's pay grade. Thanks for any help you can give.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I've been given multiple answers from docs. None have either panned out or made sense.Overall, I'm physically fit, but have the energy of a 105yo cripple. My BP and HR are all over the place, I black out every time I stand up, etc.  Most days I can barely get around the house. Despite not being able to get any exercise for several years, when I do have a good day, it's like nothing every happened. During remissions, I can still run a marathon, sprint well into the high 30's or low 40km/h (yes, I'm a cheetah and now have the spots to prove it). I can still climb like a goat, and my max dead lift is .... well people insist I have the retard strength. But this only happens usually for a few days a year at most. On an average day, I'm essentially as active as most 90 year olds, if not less. On a bad day, I lay on the couch, which is difficult because when I crash, all my joints get stupid and I end up with multiple disc bulges if the crash lasts more than a week.\n\nWhen I'm having a bad few months, my HR typically rests around 120-150bpm, and BP bounces between hyper/hypotensive. On an average, not crashy day, my resting HR is 55-60bpm. When I crash bad, I lose around 5-10kg in under a week, with no change in fluid intake. This puts me down from an average of 180lbs, to 160lbs in a week. It takes a few months to gain it back as I slowly recover.\n\nI've been told Lupus, then next doc insists the previous doc was crazy and that it's definitely not Lupus. No two doctors have ever looked at historical diagnostics, relying instead only on a single point in time snapshot ordered by them. I've had very strong ANA and ANCA, but then a month later both are negative. Very obvious inflammatory markers, and then gone 2 days later. All immune related cells are at the bottom  of, or below reference range, with the only exception being a very occasional spike in WBC (but nothing else). No one has ever found any conclusive evidence of anything, though again, one doc will be positive it's Lyme diesease, while the next 10 insist it definitely is not.\n\nI have Hashimotos but Synthroid did not work, instead just causing massive panic attacks and chronic tachycardia. I take NDT which keeps my TSH/T3/T4 relatively close to reference. I also showed positive for celiac according to IgE/IgG, but was not able to get that confirmed with a biopsy.I've had moderate-severe abdominal distension since day one (12 years ago), again, resolving spontaneously, and extremely quickly. IE: My gut can be 10\" distended at 5pm, and completely resolve by 7 or 8pm. No, I'm not taking a massive dump. This is not due to urination or ejecting a poo-baby. 10\" of gut just disappears. I look pregnant most of the time, but when it resolves, I look like I've always been in peak physical condition.  I get inflammation in my eyes pretty constantly, they get incredibly itchy and feels like there's sand in my eyes. Nothing has ever resolved this properly, but when it gets bad, I've found that colloidal silver prevents it from progressing to the point where my eye is pressing on my optic nerve and all I can see is white.\n\nThese marks appeared with the rest of the disease about 12 years ago. They come and go. When the show up it's always when I'm feeling like shit, and typically, if they're not present, I feel ... better, but still really shit. They just appear bright red, mostly on my shins and outsides of calves. They eventually turn into a scab and then scar. I had one biopsy'd a few years back and conclusions was \"some type of vasculitis\" but doc refused to look into it further to determine the specific type.\n\nFirst images are first day presentation. Last image is the resultant scarring, which covers about 10% of my lower legs at this point. I typically don't scar visibly for more than a year, so it's hard to see how many of these have been present.\n\nMy list of symptoms is 12 pages long. Yes, I've very seriously considered I may just be a hypochondriac, but at the end of the day, some very smart folk agree that my clinical presentation and diagnostics really can't be imagined.\n\nThe disease clearly operates in cycles. The periodicity used to be very obvious for the first 5 years, with a crash lasting 25-27 days, a 2-4 day remission and then circling back. Cycles are no longer well defined, though I seem to have longer crashes, followed by longer and potentially more complete periods of remission. The past 3 years for example, was horrendously bad and I did almost nothing beyond laying around the house, but then I had about 2-3 months of pretty decent remission to the point I was able to start light weight training and biking a little.\n\nI eat nothing but pork sausage, potatoes, blueberries, coconut oil/protein, and rice milk. This part might be a bit of neuroticism, but I've always felt like I do substantially better, on average, with this diet. Every few years I try to reintroduce a few veggies, and occasionally they'll be well tolerated, but only temporarily. I just tend to crash far more often, and far more severely if I don't stick to my absurd diet.\n\nI smoke tobacco. Without fail, every time I have quit, I end up in a massive crash and never recover. I've quit for a year at a stretch, and spent every other day in the ER. The next remission occurred within' 12 hours of when I started smoking again. Nicotine isn't the ticket. Vapes didn't do shit. It's tobacco only.  My father has a very similar story overall, with a strong suspicion that his health declined (with nearly identical onset and progression to mine), within' a few days of smoking cessation. That's where my disease began as well. I've heard that my entire paternal family has the same disease, or at least very similar symptoms and progression, and always identical onset in that it begins with smoking cessation in smokers, or in late teens for the non-smokers.\n\nI lost faith in practising physicians years ago. $20k min bounty if someone figures this out (the entire underlying pathology)  in a way that can be definitively proven. I've got mountains of diagnostics I can post up.\n\n\\*edit\\* My brain is completely scattered most of the time and I forget all the important stuff.\n\nGut: Wrecked. During remission, abdominal distension resolves completely and bowel movements are normal. During a crash, or just on average, distension is a few to 12\", and I have to run to the bathroom usually 3-7x between 8am and 11am. This sometimes alternates with severe constipation. I have stabbing pains in my gut pretty consistently. My digestion seems to usually be extremely slow. I almost always feel like I badly need to burp, but can't. When I can, it feels amazing.\n\nThroat: During crashes, I experience a choking sensation, that has landed me in the ER many times. It seems to affect blood flow to brain as well as my airways. Everything points to some type of pharyngeal spasm. Talking too much causes me to lose my voice entirely in short order. I can't have a regular conversation for more than a few minutes before voice starts giving out. Feels like I just can't make my vocal chords work anymore, like they're in spasm.\n\nBrain: Hard to really talk about brain function. I solve complex problems for a living (and for fun). Everything from STEM to troubleshooting big dumb truck stuff (engineering). Brain can usually brain pretty well, but during a crash I get much slower. During a serious crash, my brain seems to just short out entirely at seemingly random intervals. Seems like seizures, but nothing confirmed. I don't lose awareness, but I lose all conscious control of my thoughts and body for a few seconds. It's like severe vertigo, but for consciousness.\n\nNeurological: Random stabbing pains throughout body. Not present during remission, intermittent/sporadic/common during crashes. No loss of sensation.\n\nSkin: Beyond the images below, I also get a rash on the bridge of my nose and into my eyebrows, extending about half way outwards. Also get big chunks of flaky skin just fall off, mostly around any dense hair follicles (beard/moustache and a little on eyebrows). Does not occur anywhere else. I've tried anti bacterials/fungals and anti-inflammatories. Nothing seems to have any affect.\n\nConnective tissue: Always hurts, not as bad during remission. When I can do some light weight training, I can still lift a surprising amount. My muscles work, but my connective tissue can't keep up, and seems to tear if i'm not extremely careful. Predomenently in elbows, knees, and spine.\n\nMuscles: Work fine during remission. Feel like they run out of gas during crashes or on average. The whole thing feels like I'm simply lacking some ingredient, vital for all metabolic processes. Muscles spasm if I try to use them when I know I shouldn't. ie: if I try to pick something heavy up, my arm/back/legs will just spasm and stay constricted. I can usually feel it coming and just all stop, and go lie down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/quiauhrugys31.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af315d4489c685e423038264c3749bfe4a038df6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/esifnp034ys31.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ae2aec9e6b7fd2f54b9274bcebf9890c5e0c3e0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mln4wz5w4ys31.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f65e370cc1c2e1efc948c7617c44777c64bd09e", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Preceding my own memories I am told that I had similiar issues and many times would throw up\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay for the actual post:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Condition\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Throat feels like it is swollen (in particular the area near the back of the mouth, I believe the region is the \\*soft palate\\*. - take this with a grain of salt though as I have no medical experience and am usually too overwhelmed by the sensation when this condition occurs to be able to accurately note location)\n2. Feels like there is a lump in my throat that I can swallow then it comes back almost a second later (coughing with a great deal of force seems to allow the lump feeling to go away for maybe like 15 seconds (I believe the term is globus sensation but I heard that refers specifically not to eating)\n3. Difficulties breathing (I am unsure of this one, it atleast feels this way)\n4. Can last between 10 minutes to several hours (if I dont attempt to alleviate condition)\n5. Typically lasts about 30 minutes when I follow the steps listed in \"Methods\".\n6. typically results in vomitting which SOMETIMES can momentarily fix it and will usually fix it within 10 minutes\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* LEVELS\n\n1. feels like excess of phlegm. ussually only small lump. easiest one to prevent/alleviate (see next section, in particular parts 1 and 2 are usually enough to make the condition go away after 10-40 minutes). CAN PROGRESS. if methods of alleviation are not attempted, there is a decent chance this will progress to the next level. (OCCURENCE: everytime I eat if I dont follow step 3. more than half the time if I do follow steps 1, 2, and 3.\n2. See (1) + now the swelling of the soft palate occurs. Will almost always progress if not dealt with. Will always progress if method 1 (below) isnt followed. (OCCURENCE: ussually once a day)\n3. Big lump, difficulties swallowing, it returns nearly instantly, coughs make me nauseous and need to throw up. cant move or think or I will vomit. Hard to describe more because it is such an awful state that I cant focus on anything besides avoiding vomitting (OCCURENCE: used to be several times a week when I actually ate breakfast then went to classes. now it typically is once a week but I did go almost a month without it once)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Methods for alleviation: (will have parts but they must be done together)\n\n1. DONT MOVE, DEFINITELY DONT TALK (movement and speaking seem to reset progress towards condition fading and can amplify it)\n2. Look down, breath deeply. focus on not coughing. ignore feeling of choking\n3. MOST IMPORTANT AND OLDEST: cough drops. They many times will make the condition atleast bearable and ussually can prevent a level 1 incident from increasing into a level 2 and rarer they can prevent a 2 from becoming a 3.\n4. EDIT: I didnt realize I missed this (so if i refer to \"all methods\" exclude this one. Burping. Excessive and loud and long burps in succession. Does not have much impact on level 3 although does alleviate suffering in small part for maybe around 5 seconds. This is a very recent update. I just discovered this method within the last few months. It is not terribly effective but can definitely help in stages 1 and 2, also it is good for alleviating suffering in levels 1 and 2. (mainly a method of relieving tightness feeling but does little to actually progress towards the symptoms dispersing... that is it doesnt help much with the 30 minute length. The relief though can make it easier to avoid coughing which worsens the symptoms and is more likely to progress stages and very likely to induce vomiting.\n\n* Trigger:\n\neating or drinking (it doesnt happen everytime i eat or drink but atleast to some degree happens daily and to a worse degree-weekly)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* specifications: (of trigger)\n\n1. is always worse in the morning and is nearly a guarantee of being the worst level (is guaranteed if step 1 isnt followed)\n2. drinking has been noted that sometimes even a small drink of water in the morning can cause it (mostly have seen this in the morning but could be other time) (the earlier I wake up, the more likely this is to cause it).\n3. Eating doesnt have to be any particular food. That is, most foods seem to have an equal likelyhood of causing the condition ---NOTE : (I do have a minor allergy to milk that makes me produce an excess of phlegm, which can make this problem worse... they are independent conditions. The milk allergy happens everytime without fail and isnt guaranteed to trigger the condition).\n4. soft drinks, specifically coke, from Mcdonalds are nearly guaranteed to create the worst degree of the condition.\n5. Usually happens within 10-30 minutes of eating/drinking (the start)--- almost guaranteed to develop to an unspecific level if I dont preemptively follow steps 1 and 3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Notes of possible importance\n\n1. My mother and grand father a very minor level of this condition--- my siblings do not.\n2. Many times when I vomit (any time, not just as a result of the condition) even if it is hours later I will find big chunks of undigested food and completely intact capsule pills\n3. I do have a lot of allergies (not food) and they make the problem worse (probably just because they make me have a stuffy nose and hard time breathing already then this condition is just the kicker)\n4. I do not believe this is an allergy to food. All foods/drinks cause it (milk products to a slightly greater degree due to phlegm production from \"allergy\" to milk).\n5. I wrote it above but I'll write it again. Despite what I say prior to this, Mcdonalds coke is nearly guaranteed to cause atleast a level 2 but ussually a level 3\n6. I believe I was already tested for: GERD, but am not positive. The procedure involved being put to sleep and having a camera of some kind moved into my stomach- no actual surgery occurred.\n7. At the age of 10 I was in an accident (hit by jet ski) fracturing many bones in the right upper side of my face. The reason for note is that after this accident, I seemed to go without a single incident of the condition (to my and other's memory).\n8. Due to the condition I have very poor dietary practices leaving me often dehydrated and with around 1200 calories a day. I am sure this worsens it in some way but I do not believe it to be the cause since the condition came before this. Also for a large time I did drink mostly enough and eat around 2000 calories--- this current poor practice comes from living alone and just having no motivation to put effort into something that makes me feel awful.\n9. Incidences of great stress/distress/sadness/loss/etc do not seem to be contributory.\n10. Sometimes if there is a tight grip on my neck (fulling buttoned dress shirt, turtlenecks, etc, a persons hand as a joke) it can induce a stage somewhere between 2 and 3. I do not remember a time where the fully buttoned collar didnt lead to vomitting and the issue is not after doing so if I re button the shirt.\n11. Laying down seems to put the condition in a void state. That is, little/no progress towards the (lets just say) 30 minutes can be achieved during this time. Usually doesnt worsen or progress to vomitting while laying down. can sometimes progress immediately upon standing up.\n12. Recently I have been burping ALOT. Perhaps due to my 30 minutes of deep breathing after eating? like some days if im eating remotely properly I will be burping at least 20 times a day and have had a time where I was burping like every 15 minutes when talking to people after following my steps.\n13. (when experiencing the condition) Coughing has a similiar feeling of relief to burping momentarily, followed by intense nausea and feeling my food in my chest (chest, not stomach). Coughing also is likely to progress the stage, reset the timer towards the condition ending.\n14. It is possible that some symptoms are exaggerated due to Sensory Processing disorder as stated in pre-existing. I have speculated for awhile that perhaps my throat is just so sensitive that the act of eating makes it believe I am choking and is attempting to deal with the issue. I doubt this as it is contradictory to some of my examples and I don't know enough about (neurology? and/or the processes of the throat) to know if this is absurd or not\n15. EDIT: here and below of this section were added after the fact\n16. I have in the past 5 or so years started needing a lot more sleep. like 13 hours or more. I have on several times slept over 18. \n17. I often have feelings of a headache, spikes up when I turn head (I believe this is allergies)\n18. Most mornings I wake up drenched in sweat. Like my bed is actually damp all over where I was laying (recent development-- like 6 years ago)\n19. I somewhat regularly (once every few days maybe?) experience bad burning in left side of my upper chest\n20. A few times a month my heart rate will go mental and I can feel my chest thumping extremely hard and fast. This isnt provoked by exercise or any physical activity\n21. I spent a lot of time sitting down at a desk\n22. When I cry my entire nose/throat area becomes overwhelmed and I can fill tissues with one nose blow and a large amount of mucus or something is in my mouth and I get an ungodly headache.\n23. I have history of heart problems on both sides and diabetes I (thats the one from birth right?) from one side.\n24. I have very bad back acne... not sure if this is relevant but maybe the hormonal influence is there and might change things?\n25. had my apendix removed around 3 years ago\n26. very low libido\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Personal comments:\n\nI just want to say thank you to anyone who has read this far. This condition has made me miserable. It has isolated me as I couldnt eat around friends. (well its contributed, there are other personal difficulties). It wasnt until I started methylphenidate that I could actually pinpoint what was feeling wrong (it was just so overwhelming before that). My inability to communicate lead to many tests on stomach and I have yet to see an ENT. Most doctors take note and ask about the condition when I see them, None of them have had any good advice on what it might be and havent truly taken me seriously on the degree to how prevalent this is in my life. I don't have lots of money and I just don't want to have to burden my family with medical expenses. My parents have dealt with enough.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI need something... anything. My google search acrobatics have reached nothing but dead ends. I was exploring lymph node swelling as opposed to soft palate but I just could not get anywhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack to what I was saying, thank you for reading all of this. I appreciate that you have taken time out of your life to express at bare minimum a desire to help. If anyone is reading this because finally there is a decent result to \"throat swelling after eating\" and you are looking for help, I wish you did not have to be going through this as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny suggestions on conditions for me to look into would be great. I plan on seeing an ENT and would like to avoid as much testing as possible and want to get the most out of my visit (IE if i come prepared I wont need to schedule a bunch more appointments-- we can get down to buisness faster). I dont want another doctor suggesting large life style changes that end up doing nothing and in the end just waste months. This isnt because of diet. No absurd of a diet could have these affects for such an extended time frame and be unaffected by lifestyle changes along the way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy current list of possibilities:\n\n1. GERD but I believe I already tested this\n2. Zenker's diverticulum, also known as hypopharyngeal diverticulum\n3. Dysphagia\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of these only hit a couple boxes but they are the only things I could find that weren't temporary/developed issues (cancer, allergy, virus, infection, etc)", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Concluded based on bloodwork history maybe it's just a me thing.)\n\nHave been seeing an integrative doc lately though who thinks infection since my nk cells are elevated (she had more extensive bloodwork done), and had me do 2 runs of different antibiotics, also had me do 30 days of nystatin pills an overgrowth of yeast in my gut that showed on testing. I've also been taking vitamins (d, k, b complex, c) - my D has been low for a long time and I just found out my vit C level has been super low.\n\n\nLately, I've been feeling a little better with some things - not sure if it's due to the antibiotics I was on or something else - but one thing that I have *no clue* about is this persistent facial flushing I've been having going on. It's been off and on for probably at least a year, and it seems to go through periods of being more frequent and less. It usually happens in the early to mid-late evening, and will last up to a few hours. I haven't been able to figure out any definitive triggers for it despite trying to keep track, though it also sometimes happens when I have to go out &amp; drive to the doctors or something else that causes some stress/anxiety (a problem I didn't used to have), but at home it seems unrelated to stress. \n\n\nMy face gets very hot (feeling and to the touch), and quite red (not a deep deep red or purple, just kind of like bad sunburn).

Seemed worse when I got out of the shower\n\n24 years old - Extremely bad chest pains. Go to the ER, and was diagnosed with Costochondritis. Went away after 3 weeks.\n\n3 months ago - started noticing chest pain, but not like Costochondritis. Sometimes sharp, sometimes burning, but would only last a minute or so. Happened randomly through out the day but seemed worse in the evening.\n\n2 months ago - Chest Pains got worse and more frequent. Thought it could have something to do with possible irregular heart beat so I went to the ER. They did an ECG, and blood tests (Chem 8, Diner Quantitative, Hemogram, Thyroid Panel, Troponin). Nothing unusual except I was a little low in iron. They were certain the chest pains were not caused by my heart. I left the ER diagnosed with Sinus Tachycardia and Mild Microcytic Anemia.\n\nFew Days After ER Visit - Noticed a pain in my neck that was not unlike my chest pain. Sharp, didn't last more than a minute, and random. I had started taking iron supplements the same day I left the ER, and knew that Iron Supplements can cause acid reflux, so I told myself it was probably that.\n\n3 days ago - Still getting chest pain as well as throat pain, although seemingly much more infrequent. Had felt a lot better after the ER visit since I knew it had nothing to do with my heart, and had kind of learned to ignore the pain. I was talking to my roommate, just swinging my arms back and forth when I got terrible pain in my chest. I tried to ignore it, so I took some Ibuprofen and went to bed.\n\nYesterday - Woke up around 6am without chest or neck pain, but noticed a tingling in my right arm. Thought I slept on it wrong and just went about my day, but it never went away. Around 1 I felt extremely tired, and so I laid down for 20 minutes but accidentally slept for 6 hours. That's never happened before. When I woke up, I had pain in my neck, my right shoulder, and my right upper arm. The muscle in my upper arm also felt weak. I still felt tingling in that arm as well. I was also starting to feel tingling and pain in my left arm. I stayed up for a couple more hours and then went to sleep and to my surprise, I slept through the whole night even with my super long nap.\n\nToday - I wake up and feel completely fine. No pain, No tingling, nothing. Until around midday. The tingling is better. In fact, hardly noticeable. I am however, feeling pain in what feels like the muscles all over my body. I'm also getting muscle spasms all over, especially my stomach. The pain isn't bad, it just feels like I worked out and all of my muscles are sore.\n\nI'm so confused as to what this is.

I work construction and the dizziness is does not affect my mobility as I am not unsteady if that makes any sense. \n\nIm at my wits end with this. Obviously I\u2019m going to stop seeing my chiropractor. What should I do? I have an MRI scheduled. Should I be loading up on anti-inflammatories? Get Prolotherapy?

I can't live like this anymore, esp if I want to advance in my career or get married.\n\nI have uncontrollable gas that I can't even detect most of the times and the times that I can it is strong and smells of weed or skunk or burning rubber. All lovely smells that a young woman wishes to smells like. I have wasted hundreds of dollars on expensive perfumes, body-washes, fart filtering undies and probiotics but nothing seems to be helping and I'm not sure what is causing it. I used to never have gas ever, until it just started being consistent in uni, I never had to deal with something such as this and it killed me to go to class and anywhere else smelling like death so I started to skip classes and avoid social events.\n\nI finally told my doctor about it a month or so ago and they set up stool tests, an ultrasound and x-ray. The results that came back showed that nothing was wrong. Besides there being a lot of gas, nothing was out of the ordinary and now she thinks it might be in my head but i know it isn't, I've had enough people around me say things to and about me to know that I'm the issue and I can smell it myself sometimes. I feel so bad just living my life that people have to be around me, it makes me want to stay home or maybe just end it because I don't want to force people to be around me. I don't want to expose anyone to this so I end up not eating, thinking that maybe its some food allergy, I don't know. I have lost 20 lb while I was working, I was losing weight randomly and now its cause I don't eat as much.\n\nmy dr has given me prescriptions for florastor bid, tecta 1d, restoralax 1d, and gasx qid. I try to take them but I dont take the tecta as I think I might have low stomach acid as I took the baking soda on an empty stomach test. I don't drink or smoke or use any drugs.\n\nNow I am just waiting for my consultation for a colonoscopy in dec and I really hope she finds the issue. I don't know what is causing it, but it has taken over my entire life for years.\n\nI do also have a root canal that I need to get done and an abscess on the gum in that area, just fyi.

I am a 28 year old male 255Lbs with a history of smoking and mild to moderate opiate abuse and have since quit anything besides the morning cup of coffee for the last 3 years. Tried to have one drink a year and 9 months ago. (experience mentioned below)  \nFamily history of : Diabetes,Pituitary disorder, Coronary Artery Disease, hyperthyroidism and liver disease (non alcoholic)  \nSymptoms started around 2 years ago with the following:\n\n  \nMemory fog, Severe Fatigue, hair thinning and loss,high blood pressure, palpitations,chest pain, Frequent Urination, Sugar intolerance, muscle weakness, malaise, thirst,muscle spasms that never stop, weight gain around the mid section, exercise intolerance, breast enlargement, swift weight loss  and gain at one point without warrant, erectile dysfunction, odd body odors (pungent, fruity, strong, sometimes like chlorine or mildly urine-like), urine also sometimes smells pungent almost fruity at times \n\n\noriginally anything with sugar would cause me to urinate immediately and in volume(naturally I was also VERY thirsty) months later i tried drinking a mixed drink and i felt great almost normal for the first time in months...immedately followed up by urinating profusely about 6 to 7 times in a span of 45 - 55 minutes.\n\nSince last year the thirst and frequent urination have subsided for the most part but i still have everything else especially feeling drunk/drugged immediately after consuming sugar . Sometimes I actually feel better but its short lived and i immediately drop to feeling my \"normal\" after about 20 mins. then feel super hungry again  \nI feel \"better\" if i fast but ultimately the hunger gets to be too much. Eating anything typically makes the fog and fatigue worse but sugar is usually the one that does it.  \nStimulants are kept to a minimum but tend to make the fatigue and head fog a bit worse but i can at least run an errand or two as a trade off.  \n\n\nTests have turned up no nutritional deficiencies and negative for diabetes. in the beginning the only thing that stood out was mildly elevated BUN/ Creatinine. a year later it was mildly elevated protein   \nThyroid is normal no other endocrinology has been done  \nNeurology turned up negative for MS  \n\n\n  \noriginally i was following a workout schedule when i noticed i just was not able to recover within 2 days or so no matter the intensity and i could not lose weight. I did notice i was HUNGRY but for certain foods like Broccoli or chicken i could not get enough of certain greens.  \nthings have gotten to the point where a simple walk around the block or two takes me out for a day or so. My last stress test put me out for a week and i noticed my hair starting to fall out again. the fatigue isn't like a tired feeling but more of i have the energy but all of a sudden i go very weak.  \n\n\nIt seems like my body cannot take any sort of physical stress  and when put through it i feel almost faint perhaps about an hour after for a day or so with these \"mini-fevers\" the kind that usually happen if you over do it at the gym but thats about where im constantly stuck at. Sometimes if its too much exertion i feel like what i would describe as going into shock . The only kind of direction I've been given is perhaps have my adrenals looked at (advice from a family member's GP) i have not been able to work , maintain a social life or just even thrive in general as a result. Its been just short of a living hell if not for my loving and supportive friends and family.\n\n  \nHonestly I just want my life back and need all the \\[credible\\] info i can get  \n\n\n  \nI meet with my GP again late this week for a follow-up\n\nWhat Key symptoms should we focus on here since there are many without it all being lost in the mix?  \n\n\nHow should i be explaining myself to make sure how to convey the intensity and impact it has on my quality of life without it sounding just over-exaggerated?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat tests should i be asking for if any?  \n\n\nAre there any other illnesses we should put on the table for consideration?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Ive talked to my neurologist about my memory and concern and asked him if i could have an mri as peace of mind.. he insists this is due to anxiety. Previous to this i messaged him 2-3 times but his colleagues responded as they were covering him while he was out. One said : with an mri  less than a year ago should be sufficient and memory loss is a common symptom of anxiety. The 2nd Doctor replied : An 11 month old mri is sufficient and is reassuring that your optic nerve did not show signs of intercranial pressure. I ended up going to the E.R a couple days ago and was going to pay out of pocket for an mri.. i had lied about previous imaging saying i had none.. the E.R doctor ran neurological test on me testing functions etc.. she also gave me 3 words to remember \"yellow rose, 59th street , and telephone book\" and she walked away and i repeated them to her 10 mins later..she offered me a ct scan but said it wouldn't be wise because she was sure it would come back clear and would only expose me to more radiation. I ended up not doing the C.T scan and she concluded it as anxiety .. 2 nights ago I was so stressed out about this whole ordeal because i feel like im not being heard i googled symptoms of brain tumors and was sitting in my room stressed out.

Whenever I get worked up it looks like I have blotches on my face, mainly around my nose and mouth. My father had a random flashback and told me that when I was little (3 or 4) I had chickenpox. My brother had them at the time so they tried to get the whole thing out of the way by incubating me with him. This was the 80s so pretty common back then. Little me decided chickenpox wasnt enough apparently. My mother tried to take me to the doctor but he wouldn't see me thinking my mother was just another overly worried mom. Well after a week went by and I had doubled in size with each pock looking like an egg formed underneath and some started bursting open. This is when my mother forced her way into the doctors office and the doctor said, \"oh crap.\" I had gotten impetigo on top of my open chicken pox which allowed the staph infection in my body nearly killing me. Obviously I was treated quickly after that.. but my real question is that for my entire life I have gotten this very blotchy rash when exerting myself and want to know if this is normal. I tried looking up if this can be a lasting side effect in adults but all I find is the normal symptoms and if you have the rash, you have impetigo.. but this is consistent through my whole life and it gets very hot to the touch for about an hour afterward. Does anyone know of any research about lasting side effects from the disease? \n\nTLDR I had impetigo and chickenpox as a kid and want to know if my lifelong affliction of a pop up face rash when I exert myself is a long term side effect of this.

On Saturday, I shared this to my mother who looked into my mouth and found a bulge on my right side of the mouth. Since I experience tonsillitis every year, I've been given a hot tea and recommended staying in bed to sweat. (Okay, make fun of me as being in mother's care...)\n\nI think this is worse than usual - apart from having to go to school (Obviously, it's not as easy as in HS), I also experience thick saliva (or is it phlegm? I don't have runny nose at all) forming in my mouth and I am not able to spit it out as normally, I just open my mouth and let it drop to a glass next to my bed, so far it's half full (in 8 hours total - I've been using something else before, but wasn't keeping track)  Mom commented that it can mean that the infection (inflammation) has \"caught\" my salivary glands as well. Yet when I google it, it shows that the infection should *reduce* saliva production.\n\nSometimes I also try to \"throw up\" - or, how should I describe it, as opposite process of swallowing. That hurts even worse, and I can feel something small and solid in my mouth - yet when I spit it all out, I don't feel any relief.\n\nAlso I'd like to add that I can last pretty long without opening my mouth, yet is it (obviously) uncomfortable. And no drooling spots on my bed when I slept for 3 hours.\n\n\\---------------------\n\nSo, what exactly do I have? What kind of house treatment should I choose?

I've had a lot of issues in the past year though, and I'm thinking that it's either some medication that has done some damage, or something going on in my body chemistry that's causing medication to really affect me.\n\nLast fall, I was put on a combination of Wellbutrin for depression and Seroquel to counteract the trouble sleeping. I discontinued them both after about 2 months after experiencing a plethora of increasing side effects such as extreme chills, hot and cold temperature intolerance, painful muscle tension, distorted smells, diarrhea, nausea, panic, and cold sweats.\n\nI quit both cold turkey (due to frustration of lack of help from doctors), and except for the distorted smells, most of that stuck around for quite a while as I went into what I assume was withdrawal. \n\nThe worst was the awful chills. It didn't feel like the kind you get when your're sick; it's like how sometimes you get a chill when you pee - except all the time. It was by far the worst I've  ever physically felt. No doctor was ever able to give me an answer to what happened, though.\n\nA couple of months later, my family doctor switched my blood pressure medication to a beta blocker, Bisoprolol. I started having PVCs of my heart, and they upped the dosage of the Bisoprolol. It eventually started making me extremely dizzy, so I tried several configurations of lower doses. Eventually, I ended up on a very low dose of Atenolol.\n\nHere's where it gets strange, because after struggling with the dosages, I now feel very much like I did when I had a bad reaction to the Wellbutrin/Seroquel and went into withdrawal. I'm having a lot of chills, anxiety, hot/cold intolerance, etc. again.\n\nI've had my blood sugar and thyroid tested, and everything comes back normal. My wild guess, not being a doctor, is that maybe both things have affected something like adrenaline?\n\nI feel like my biggest problem getting help is that I have so much trouble describing what it physically feels like, as before last fall, it's a sensation I've never felt.\n\nI can probably answer questions better than I can try to describe it, but I definitely appreciate any ideas!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Let me also preface this by saying im a 26yr old male, 5'11\", 175lbs. i would have said i was in really good health. My dad has type II diabetes and mom has been diagnosed with anxiety disorder before. Sister got Irritable bowel syndrome after costa rica. but otherwise no real history of anything bad running in the family.\n\n    Anywho, one day i was standing up stretching my neck and i heard an audible pop like noise. (Specifically stretching my neck all the way to the right, right ear touching shoulder). Not 10 seconds later did i get a intense head rush and felt like i was going to pass out and had to sit down. Went to urgent care, doctor said i probably just caused a stress response by jolting my arteries in the neck. Felt much better later that day but still shaken. \n\n    Day after i go to work again and in the room i feel like i might get light headed and pass out again. Instead go to the hospital to error on the safe side. Brain xray preformed to see if there are any tumors. Blood taken to run labs on electrolytes and complete blood count to check for anemia and what not. Everything besides my potassium checks out normal. Potassium is slightly out of range(lower). Give me some potassium drink and off i go. \n\n   Feel fine the next 2 days, then on the third. Out walking with my girlfriend at a garden center looking at flowers. Out of nowhere, start having that same feeling of passing out. This time seems worse and i think i freaked myself out more but by the time we got to the hospital my legs were shaking hardcore and i was having trouble walking. They do an xray of my neck with contrast to see if anything is pinching my neck blood vessels.  Everything checks out, i calm down. Basically allude it to an anxiety attack. \n\n\n    Go see my family doctor.  She wants to put me on a steroid in case i injured my spine or have like a herniated disc or something pushing on my spine. and just for the healing factor.  Says to give it time and rest and monitor. \n\n   That steroid must have wrecked havoc on me. I start belching and having severe indigestion.  like almost debilitating, and this is after about 3 days on it. I have to stop taking it in hopes that some relief would be found. \n\n   Things seem to get better after 2 days. Then trouble strikes. My heart rate wont settle down. constantly around 90-120. Have trouble sleeping. This seems to go on for almost a week until the steroid runs its course. \n\n   Go to see a cardiologist next to make sure my heart is okay and i dont have wolfman white syndrome i think it was called, and just check everything.  wear a holter monitor and record times when my heart feels like its freaking out and causing palpitations. Again, everything seems to be fine. But also by the time i had worn the holter monitor i started feeling better. \n\n   Like two weeks of feeling god, yay!  BAM! back to episodes of feeling like passing out.  Go see a neurologist and they do a brain eeg. Common theme here, everything is a okay. \n\n  Somehow get a wind of fortune and i feel back to myself for almost 3 weeks with the occasional bad day thrown in. Well turns out i was headed straight for indigestion town. Worse than before. Go to see a gastroenterologist. Preforms a biology and puts me on prantapropanal or however its spelled. Endoscopy says i have inflammation near the bottom of my stomach but everything else is okay. \n\n   4 days after endoscopy,  and i feel the best ive felt in a long time. Fast forward to 4 days ago(after being on propant....(proton pump inhibitor) for 2 weeks and that indigestion is back with a vengeance.  i was afraid to eat anything.  let alone drink water. anything seems to do it.  also side note, i tired going gluten free for 2 weeks to see if that helped in case it was celiac or something.  \n\n\nPast two days have been nothing short of hell. got a pain in my chest, right behind my sternum.  errored on the side of caution and went to the er.  chest xray done and troponin and cdk levels tested. everything came back okay. Gave me a GI cocktail and that seemed to actually help. attributed it to just inflammation from burping so much. \n\nWell here we are at present day, and burping is still there. if anything its lessened. but now i have the feelings of lightheadedness and passing out again except this time it feels like the sides of my head have heavy weights.  and my throat is closing up. looking up and stretching my neck seems to worsen everything and when i talk alot it seems to greatly worsen things. it goves me a gagging feeling when that happens too. like I might throw up. \n\n\nAnything and everything will help. im sorry it was a long read but thanks for staying till the end. ill try and respond to comments as fast as possible and sorry for some general data in some spots", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I'll be on the same dose of the same medication for months or years at a time, but my TSH will be 0.02 with a T4 well below reference range (yes, the opposite of what we should see), or a low TSH with high T4, but extremely low T3, or High TSH with high T3/T4 as well. I've only had maybe 9 or 10 months in the past 12 years where my TSH roughly aligned as expected, with T3/T4 status. (T3 always on the high side, T4 on the low side, and TSH right around 1. (ref 0.3-5.0).\n\n6 few weeks ago I had an apt with a rheumatologist and he noted that I was tachycardiac. I told him my regular resting HR when I'm not dying, is 55-65 and standing usually around 95-105. We did a bunch of diagnostics, I always have low WBC and other immune cells, and TSH was 3.65 (the highest it's been in many years) while T3 and T4 were like always, slightly high and slightly low.The tachycardia continued increasing for the past 6 weeks. This happens, but never for this long. I also usually experience throat constriction from the right side on regular intervals, but this time it was lasting longer than normal.On Sept 23, the tachycardia hit me hard, along with severe chest pain, palpitations, blackouts, etc. I called the local healthlink who told me I definitely needed to get to an ER.  This was about noon, so I stopped taking my thyroid meds, and went to the ER. They said it wasn't a heart attack and discharged me without giving me any indication of what I should do. TSH was checked in ER and found to be 0.04. They didn't follow up on this.Next morning (sept 24) at 9am, I went to the lab to do TSH/T3/T4 and got :TSH 0.04 (ref 0.3-5.0)T3 8.7 (ref 3.5-6.5)T4 18 (ref 12-22)I haven't had a T4 that high in &gt;10 years. T3 was slightly elevated above my normal 6.5-7, and TSH was still unchanged.Called healtlink again to speak to a nurse, explained the situation, and she insisted I go to another ER immediately, and kept trying to call me an ambulance.I went to a different ER on the 24th at around 2pm. As before, they checked ECG, general chemistry, and hematology. Nothing new there. They did not check thyroid at all. Doc and I discussed and he said he had no idea what was going on, and that he was sending the case to internal medicine, and they'd be with me shortly.7 hours later, some woman busts into my room and immediately starts yelling at me, accusing me of self medicating with stolen thyroid medications, self dosing that medication, being a drug addict, and having a long and well documented history of this. I honestly thought she was a mental patient, but long short, she's an actual doctor and after a few minutes of me trying to ask a question and her just cutting me off, she told me I can have a prescription for Propranolol and a referral to an endocrinologist (which I wouldn't get to see for at least a year or two). Again, more back and forth here because I have severe asthma and vaculitus, both of which are contraindicated with propranolol, and she still hadn't even confirmed I was the correct patient, nor given me her name, but at the end of it, I told her I'd take the prescription and referral, and she stormed out of the room without a word. An hour later a nurse hands me a prescription that says:\n\n1. Continue desicatted (sic) thyroid at current dose until seen by and endocrinologist. USE OWN SUPPLY!!!!\n2. Propranalol (and the dosage and instructions no one could read).\n\nSo anyhow, I went to see my NP the next morning, as at this point I have no idea what to do. My NP's not available but I saw the head NP who said very clearly, do not continue taking thyroid meds, and do not take propranolol (for the same reasons I'd come up with). She wanted to see thyroid levels after another day or so off the meds.\n\nSo today I did TSH/T3/T4 again.TSH 0.03 (ref 0.3-5.0)T3 (still waiting)T4 18 (ref 12-22).\n\nSo it's been almost 5 days since my last dose of the desicated thyroid, and my TSH is still dropping, T4 hasn't changed at all, and presumably T3 is going to be about the same.\n\nSo, what's going on here? How can T4 have not changed whatsoever, 5 days after my last dose, TSH decreased further, and T3 wasn't really all that elevated in the first place? I've always wondered about the relationship between TSH and T3/T4, as mine has very rarely aligned correctly, and it seems strange that everyone figures it takes TSH up to two months to reflect a change in thyroid status. It seems like TSH is really more incidental, and that something else must be able to modulate thyroid output.  \nI mean, I could have some T3/T4 secreting adenoma which could explain why the T4 didn't decrease at all over 5 days, but it'd have had to increase it's production by precisely the amount the pills would have normally given me. I just can't see that being realistic.\n\nCurrently:\n\n* Resting HR - flapping between 65 and 105\n* Standing HR - usually around 120-190\n* BP - alternating between 110/80 and 165/70 (roughly)\n* Temp - 98.7 (this is exactly 1\\*C higher than I've ever recorded in the past decade.\n* Not sweating, nor anxious. I get panic attacks often when I'm having flare ups, but nothing this time.\n* Abdomenal distension completely resolved, gut feels like a vacuum and I look like I'm about to blow away in a gentle breeze.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

It is very frustrating to say the least.\n\nI have periods in which I\u2019m fine or at least mostly fine, but I have even more periods of just feeling terrible (like right now).

Long story short, my mother has been dealing with this for going on 10 years. Each year, multiple times per year, she says very worrying things like she can't keep going on like this with doctors not being able to diagnose her and figure out what's causing her issues. This condition has stolen 10 years of both of our lives and has ruined them. We've been to ENTs, dentists, dermatologists, no one seems to be able to help. But maybe, just maybe, the internet can come through and there's someone out there who has a new idea or can point us in the right direction here.\n\n64 year old white female. 5'9  approx 140 pounds. Eastern US.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll try to be as brief as to the point as possible. Approx 10 years ago my mother complained of a bad taste in her mouth. Dentists could not diagnose cause of bad taste. This was followed by an intense pain felt above number 6 tooth (right canine) that remains constant. Mother feels flu-like symptoms along with this. Over the course of the 10 years, my mother, who previously had excellent teeth, started to lose them to rot and decay. My mother feels thick mucus that she moves by leaning over onto her side for hours at a time, move from an area above her gums above the number 6 tooth and somehow runs down to the bath of her throat where she swallows it all day. ENTs have scoped her sinuses (the 30-60 second exam they do after squirting the stuff into her nostrils) and her sinuses appear clear to them. Dentists say that since this manifests down her throat it's an ENT issue. Pressing on her face in that area causes intense pain. Basically, no one seems able to figure this out and they have consistently kicked the ball back and forth. Meanwhile, my mother is losing her mind trying to figure this out. My mom recently went to a dentist at my insistence to get the number 6 tooth pulled in the hopes that it might be connected and the dentist refused to pull it because he says it appears health. They took an x-ray of my mom as part of the procedure and the slide that they put on display took my mom off guard. Above her number 6 tooth, her sinus wall appears to fade away in the EXACT location of where she's complaining of the pain and mucus movement. I've attached a picture of it, hopefully the quality is good enough to see what I'm describing.  One wall has a straight, visible line, and the wall fades. Could that be an anomaly worth investigating and if so, who should we see? Who should we see for any of this? No other x-ray, CT, or MRI has been able to show anything weird except this. We've been wondering if a sonogram on that part of her face would be worth trying to get, but it's like pulling teeth to get any doctor to order a test.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: x-ray\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0159xbafidv31.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d4b71d4b004c286c00dc0211e40362158690b64", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

And when I try to push through it,  then my legs start to be in pain. Just the other day I speed walked  three blocks and was in pain for 15-30 minutes. I couldn't bare to bend  my legs and was having a lot of difficulty standing. After a while, the  bottoms of my feet stopped hurting but my calves/shins were still in a  lot of pain, and bending my feet/ankles were causing a lot of pain as  well.\n\nPlease help me figure out what this could be.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Any advice appreciated!", "author": "AlexandriaVineyard", "self_text": "24F\n5\u20196\n75kg\nCaucasian\nU.K\nNo existing medical issues \nNexplanon Implant (contraception)\nUsed to be a casual drinker (~2x/mo), doing Stoptober with my family \nNo recreational drug use \n\nSo for the past few weeks I\u2019ve been REALLY struggling to sleep - not managing to sleep until 3/4/5am, waking every hour or less, and, although throughout the day I feel it, but ignore it, when I get into bed I can feel this almost adrenaline feeling in my arms and legs along with a tight knot of worry in my tummy, and although I feel it during the day, it\u2019s harder to ignore when I\u2019m trying to block out everything to get to bed. The adrenaline feeling makes it impossible to sleep for ages because I feel like I need to get up and go for a run, or hit something, to try and use this energy up. Some nights when I get my head into a vicious circle of thinking, I can become a little short of breath and have to \u2018talk myself down\u2019. \n\nMy mother and my sister have both experienced panic attacks in the past, but up until now, I was lucky in that I\u2019ve never experienced this - I always used to think of myself as happy go lucky person; positive, nothing could hurt me - so I\u2019m not sure if what I\u2019m feeling IS anxiety.\n\nI always used to be able to use \u2018thinking through situations\u2019 to help myself feel better. But now, I can\u2019t stop it when it reaches its \u2018end point\u2019. I panic, and go through every situation - what would I do if each family member died, where they might die, how they might die, how I would support my family, what they would do, what I would do, etc. It varies from financial situations, to death, to other situations.\n\nI\u2019ve tried soothing music. Acupuncture. Cutting out all caffeine. Rescue remedy. Lavender pillow sprays. Herbal stress relief tablets. Herbal sleep teas. Clenching one muscle at a time and then releasing. Opening a window to cool my room down. I\u2019ve even tried drinking alcohol in the evening as depressants to help me sleep - Etc!\n\nI\u2019ve been through a rough year - left an amazing job to move 400 miles to live with who I thought was the one, who turned out to be narcissistic and a serial cheater, spent most of my savings on my house we lived in, then in July I found the courage to end things - moved back in with my parents, and started the process of selling the house 400 miles away. I\u2019ve only just managed to secure a job (found out Thursday) which is amazing but I\u2019m constantly aware that I\u2019ve set myself back immeasurably by following my heart, and this links in to the thoughts that run through my head with this adrenaline feeling.\n\nIn all the issues that happened during the last year, I also gained a lot of weight. I used to be 63kg, so during October my family and I have cut out all alcohol, and have been eating healthy, mostly vegetable based dinners (but we have protein I.e fish, chicken, tofu) in almost every meal, in an attempt to lose it - and it\u2019s been working, I\u2019ve been losing weight steadily, as have my parents.\n\nSince this \u2018anxiety\u2019 has become more apparent over the course of October, I\u2019m wondering if perhaps it is linked somehow to the foods I\u2019m eating? Or is this normal to have peak periods of time where it seems worse? \n\nI ask about the foods because my mother (55F, white coat syndrome, on Lisinopril for HBP) over the past few days has complained of almost my exact symptoms - insomnia, feeling too much energy, but unlike me, she\u2019s also become sullen and \u2018in a bad mood/aggressive mood\u2019. She\u2019s always been what I would call a \u2018worrier\u2019, and has been diagnosed with anxiety in the past, but I:\n\nA) want to know if what I am experiencing is anxiety? Insomnia? \n\nB) want to know if this dieting could be having an effect on both me and my mother?\n\nC) want to know what the treatment might be? If it\u2019s therapy, I know in the UK at least I can get treated quicker privately than on the NHS, so I would rather get this going as quickly as possible. \n\nD) can my UK GP tell anyone if I am diagnosed with anxiety? I don\u2019t want to lose my job! \n\nI know it sounds strange and the above is very convoluted, but this is my first experience with anxiety and I want to make sure I have all the facts - before going to a GP and discussing this with them. The last thing I want to do is waste anyone\u2019s time, and the \u2018what is anxiety?\u2019 websites can be less than helpful at the best of times! \n\nAs I type this, it\u2019s 03:22am. I\u2019m desperate, please, for any advice.\n\nThank-you to anyone in advance who responds to this, from the bottom of my heart.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I don't smoke, drink, or use drugs. Existing medical issues: GERD and IBS, which the IBS has been controlled as of late. Neck and Back issues (stemming from bad posture and emphasized by restaurant work) that have gotten much better through physical therapy exercises (which sometimes engage the chest area). Medications started for pain listed -- PPIs (20mg omeprazole in the morning), but otherwise, vitamin b12 (2500mcg a week), got the flu shot recently, iodized salt at some meals, algae omega sometimes, since I eat a plant-based diet.\n\nI've had constant chest discomfort the last week -- I would describe it as dull, flattening, radiating, even spazz inducing at times (hard to tell if this is anxiety about the fact that I'm having these pains) spread out around my upper chest from left to right, some parts worse at times than others -- essentially non-stop besides when I am sleeping (and surprisingly one other time when I was dancing at a party). I went in to see my GP and after a consultation that showed that my pulse was fine, a clear EKG, a blood pressure that was normal (I think it was 100ish/70ish), and no family history, he firmly told me he believed it to not be cardiac-related and believed it was GERD/Heartburn due to my chronic history with the disease as well as stress -- both in it's own and in it's relationship with GERD. Although I haven't checked it in a bit of time, my cholesterol has generally been perfect as well. I felt somewhat similar, but not the same chest pains, when I was could very stressed out when I first started my restaurant job (they would subside generally quickly during a shift or right after I got off), but currently, I have such a hold on it that I maintain my calm during shifts.\n\nHere I find myself about a week into PPI treatment and the pain has not really morphed or gone away. I have tried icing as well as heat it per friend thought that I may have strained a chest muscle while doing PT exercise -- and would make sense for something that is unrelenting discomfort. None of my relaxation techniques -- meditation, breathing, etc, have stopped it either.\n\nCould cardiac pain really last this long? What are yall's thoughts? I'm truly confused, uncomfortable, but quite anxious as this discomfort will not subside.\n\nAlthough my doctor did not think I needed it, I decided to get refer out to a cardiologist to see this or next week -- to avoid any ER visits/expenses/time in case it is that bad (I am already quite a bit in debt from my digestive issues).\n\nhere to answer any other questions that may help!! thank you in advance for your help!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I\u2019m White and from Northwestern America. \n\nI have some diagnosed mental health issues, but nothing diagnosed for any of my physical issues. Possibly iron deficiency anemia, but frankly doctors have never been very clear on it, so I don\u2019t know for sure. Basically sometimes I have it, sometimes I don\u2019t. I am on a few medications: \n\n- Adderall XR, 10mg x1 a day for ADHD, since July\n\n- Wellbutrin XR, 150mg x1 a day for depression, since June\n\n- Trileptal, 150 mg x2 a day for anxiety, since two weeks ago\n\n- Restoril, 7.5 mg as needed for sleep, since July, I take on average once a week maybe. \n\n- The Depo-provera shot for birth control since April. I plan on not continuing the shot. \n\n- Occasionally take Motrin for pain up to 600mgs as directed, Melatonin for sleep 10mgs, and Iron supplements 10mgs. I\u2019ve been taking all of these on an as needed basis for years. \n\n\nSo I have always been a little on the weary side, but never this bad and chronic before. For the last several months (about May/June) I have had what I consider a severe problem with dizziness and fainting. I used to very occasionally get up to fast and feel faint, but now it\u2019s almost constantly. Standing up, sitting, walking, at any moment I can just get this rush of dizziness, it feels like my brain is on fire, I have tunnel vision and the room is spinning. If I\u2019m not sitting or in a safe place I faint and usually hurt myself on the floor.  My wife usually hears me and finds me semi-conscious immediately. She tells me I\u2019m on the floor and that I fell, and I don\u2019t remember falling and think I\u2019m just laying in bed or on the couch. I\u2019m very confused and out of it. I can be totally fine, just standing up and walking around doing stuff, and then all of a sudden I\u2019m not okay. I have bumped my head, hurt my knee and ankle, and I don\u2019t know what else. My wife hasn\u2019t been home sometimes and will come home to find me out on the floor, having zero idea how long I\u2019ve been there.  \n\nI also feel incredibly frail. I have a very hard time staying in motion because I get too tired quickly. I can hardly pick up my kids anymore (20 lbs), or even hold just their legs up to change their diapers. Everything feels so heavy and hard to do lately. It seems like with almost no change to my lifestyle I\u2019ve become drastically worse. I\u2019ve always been on the weak side because of my size and frame, but I mean I used to be a competitive swimmer and taught swim. I was able to move my whole body very quickly and for a very long time. \n\nI have seen doctors, because all of this is scary as hell and is causing so much difficulty in my everyday life. My current psychiatrist and the one I\u2019ve seen in the past showed no concern over these symptoms and claimed that it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with any of my meds. I don\u2019t know if I believe them, but they do prescribe me what I need to function mentally and it\u2019s hard to find a new psychiatrist. \n\nI\u2019ve been to my primary care doctor for this in August. He was very dismissive of my symptoms. He took my blood pressure laying, sitting, and standing and it got worse each time, and was drastically low to begin with. He said he thinks it\u2019s because of Hypotension, and he can refer me to a test to confirm. Left the room, came back and said he wanted to do an EKG to rule out my heart, sounds good. Did it in office, EKG was perfect. Then said he was just gonna send me for an Echocardiogram, not Hypotension test. He also tells me I need to stop taking my Adderall right away. I told him that I can\u2019t do that without talking to my psychiatrist, and that would mean I need to stop taking my Wellbutrin too. He told me it doesn\u2019t matter and I should stop. \n\nI did not stop, because getting off medications is awful and I didn\u2019t have a psychiatrist to talk to at the time. I did not get the Echocardiogram until Mid-October, and my doctor never called me with the results so I assumed they were good, but hello I\u2019m still having problems. I called him just yesterday and he seemed surprised I wanted follow up. He told me the ultrasound was perfect, there\u2019s no problem with my heart. I said that\u2019s great, then what\u2019s next? He said \u201cOh, you\u2019re still having symptoms?\u201d YES THATS WHY IM ASKING FOR MORE HELP! He prescribed me a medication for vertigo that is apparently very safe and has no side effects, they give it to kids all the time he said. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s called because I haven\u2019t picked it up yet. He told me to take it for a week and if I\u2019m still having problems then I\u2019m going to need find a specialist, and if it helps then that\u2019s it. \n\nSo basically, I feel like this doctor just told me he can\u2019t help me anymore when he didn\u2019t really do anything in the first place. I was considering switching doctors at the practice (there are four others) but honestly I don\u2019t want another few months of waiting just for the doctor to never really help me. I want to just go straight to a specialist but I have no idea what kind, and I want to feel more informed on what my symptoms might be due to. I feel like just seeing if a medication just masks the symptoms is not good, because I think it\u2019s obvious there is a bigger problem here. Like just taking Motrin constantly for chronic headaches but never bothering to find out why. \n\nIf you take the time to read this and help me, I\u2019d appreciate it so much. I really need some help and living this way with nowhere to turn is miserable.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Can you help diagnose me?", "author": "foxxytroxxy", "self_text": "Hey all,\n\nI've recently hit a series of incidents: about 4-5 hours after ingesting a mushroom from my garden which I'd thought I identified, I started experience stomach cramps. Following this a dull aching pain which would switch between my right abdomen and the area just below my stomach. Now it can manifest at either place, and is typically relieved when I pass very smelly gas. I had a conversation with my dad who just thinks I'm constipated, but I've also read that these symptoms can come with appendicitis. What I'm wondering is this - my symptoms being what I've described above, does it appear worthwhile to get checked out even if they're not accompanied by nausea and/or vomiting? Maybe a little bit of nausea because of my workplace and eating habits, unfortunately.... But nothing that I would say is nauseous beyond a normal level for an average day for me. And no vomiting, not even an urge to vomit.\n\nMy second question is this.... Apparently, the mushroom that I convinced myself that I ate would have an asymptomatic, incubation period either directly following or directly before it causes liver failure and renal shutdown.... Do either of these things hurt? The Poison Control center told me that if I wasn't vomiting/having diarrhea, then it wasn't worth going to the hospital. My dad seems to agree that it's not worth going to the hospital; I'm unsure about it...\n\nSo if I'm not vomiting or expereincing diarrhea, they told me that amatoxins (what I thought I'd ingetsed) aren't to blame. But... is it possible that some small amount of something either in the mushroom or growing out of it, might be contributing to some form of appendicitis or something else? Because the aching pain, when it's happening, is quite troubling to me. And because it seems to move - it's either an aching in the lower right abdomen, or it sometimes becomes bloating in the stomach. Following by smelly gas. Thank you.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Had a full spinal x-Ray, clean brain MRI, Lumbar Puncture, and loads of bloodwork. Had several neurological exams done where they only noticed weakened knee reflexes which have since returned. They decided it must be psychological and sent me home. \n\nI have not improved and now the tingles/crawling everywhere (mostly waist down, upper arms, upper back, neck). I also had a period of time where my leg muscles would bubble up with twitching but this seems to have stopped for the most part. \n\nMy knees and shoulders feel weak and if I use my legs too much I\u2019ll get zaps of sharp pain near/on my knees. My muscles are easily fatigued, walking will make them achy and holding the same position for too long will cause them to become shaky. This is terrifying as before this happened I was quite active and walked, took transit everywhere. \n\nAll these sensations (tingling, crawling, twitching) seem to get worse with muscle use and dissipate (mostly) with rest. Except for the muscle aches which seem to improve with movement. \n\nIt\u2019s been almost 7 weeks and I don\u2019t know what to do. They say they\u2019ve tested me for everything but my body feels plain wrong. \n\nAnother note is about a month before this started I had a month and a half of unexplained constant abdominal pain/bloating and bowel issues. Had the full work up for that too and one day it just stopped suddenly. It stopping seemed to line up with when I took a short break from my birth control (I had been taking continuously for 4 packs).\n\nAny help would be much appreciated.\n\nUPDATE: Sensations in my face now too.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

{"post_id": "dpruip", "created_utc": 1572547166, "title": "Stuffy nose for around 8 months", "author": "GendryWaters", "self_text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello!\n\nI've been having a slightly stuffy nose for about the last 8 months now. I didn't think of checking it at a physician when it started as it wasn't too bad, and it started towards the end of winter, and so I dismissed it as a symptom of the common cold. But it never went away completely. The only time when I feel it is when I wake up in the morning and realise that one of my nostrils is blocked. It goes away within an hour or two of waking up. And the other time when I feel it is when I'm meditating. It seems that my breathing isn't as clear as it used to be before. I haven't suffered another common cold or common flu since the nasal blockage started, which I find surprising, as I used to be very susceptible to these before, and used to contract the common cold a couple of times (at least) each year. Looked around online for this, and found that it could be sinus. Bought 'Phenylephrine Hydrochloride Tablets USP 10 mg' for this, but I don't know what's the right dosage (I'm a 21 yo guy weighing 125 pounds). There's also this other problem which I think it could be. Quite a few members from my dad's side of the family had this problem of excess cartilage/bone growth in the nose. My dad and one of his sisters had to get it surgically removed (I'm not in touch with any of his other siblings, so I don't know if they had similar problems too. And I think my dad's father also had a somewhat similar problem). I don't think this is likely though as both my dad and his sister had those surgeries in their late-30s. Also, I haven't spoken to my dad (or his sister) in a while, so I couldn't ask them if they felt a similar congestion or if it was some other kind of pain. Externally, it doesn't seem to me that the shape of my nose has changed. Anyway, what I wanted to know is this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. How likely is it that the problem is indeed the sinus pressure?\n2. Is it safe to consume those Phenylephrine tablets based on this self-diagnosis?\n3. If yes, what should be the ideal dosage, and for how many days should I consume those tablets [(Here are the exact details of the tablets that I've bought)](https://www.1mg.com/drugs/solvin-decongestant-tablet-141885)?\n4. How likely is it to be the cartilage/bone growth condition that has been running in my family? Or is it even possible for such a condition to be hereditary?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Now feeling muscle soreness as well.", "author": "niksndimes", "self_text": "33, Caucasian / Mexican, USA\nNo allergies or injuries that I\u2019m aware of. \n\nAbout three weeks ago I got out of bed like normal, except when I stood up it felt like warm liquid was rolling down my right leg. The sensation lasted for a few seconds and went away. Then it happened again the next morning. I didn\u2019t think much of it until a few days later when I noticed that when walking barefoot I could feel the coldness of the floor much less than normal in that right foot. \n\nMaybe a day or two later I decided to take a very hot bath and that\u2019s when I realized that my entire leg was being affected. I could feel the heat of the water like normal in my left leg but when I put my right leg in - I could hardly feel any heat at all. \n\nI can still feel pressure just fine. And I don\u2019t have any weakness or coordination issues in the leg. \n\nIn the last few days now, I feel like my muscles are getting sore in the right leg and in my lower back as well. Not really in the spine but around my entire lower back area, just soreness that comes and goes. In my leg, the soreness is especially noticeable behind my knee and behind my thigh. \n\nMy doc pressed against my spine and I did not have any pain. He sent me in for X-rays and did blood work too. Xrays look fine and bloodwork shows folic acid deficiency but nothing else out of the ordinary. \n\nI have an MRI scheduled for next week. \n\nCurious if you all have any ideas before\nI go in for the MRI.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}
