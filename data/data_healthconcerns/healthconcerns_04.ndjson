Sometimes shoots up and around both at the same time. \n\nIt's like a slow motion lightning strike, the way it shoots up over my shoulder and/or around my right side rib cage.

At its worst, every other minute. \n\nIt does not hurt when I lift things or move in any way. Its random. Can come when I'm sitting still. \n\nI should disclose I have a history of anxiety, but have been seeing a therapist every week for the last year who is very helpful, so I know there is a possibility this is just stress pain. But on the off chance it's not, I want to be sure. Should I go in and check this out? Anyone I ask seems to think it is just stress as the past 4 weeks have been brutal on me.

I ate chicken noodle soup and bread but throughout day still felt off. Yesterday I felt the same way. The only way I can describe it is that it\u2019s a dull burning pain in my upper abdomen that radiates into my back and chest, and it feels like hunger pangs.

For the last couple of years I have had semi-random and sudden bursts of adrenaline. The reason why I say semi random is because sometimes when I'm under a lot of pressure, or someone who's judgement I am very sensitive about (like my dad) walks near me I have sudden and rapid tremors, shaking, I curse under my breath, and generally extreme but short stressful moments. And sometimes, it just happens for seemingly no reason.\n\nThis does not usually happen when I am busy, even if the thing I am busy with is on the stressful side. this usually only seems to happen when I am alone with my thoughts, or not really doing much. \n\nAfter years of repressing this thought, I'm beginning to think I am suffering from something related to anxiety. A little bit of background if you will, I have an older brother who uses terms like, ADHD, anxiety, OCD, as excuses to mooch off his parents and excuse him of his shortcomings and failure to fulfill his commitments. after communicating my concerns to my parents, they think I might have adrenal issues or something, I could not have anxiety.\n\nI have been very quiet about this issue, I really don't want to tell people if I do have anxiety, as I don't want people to think that I am just trying to hop on the mental disorder trend. Pop culture has deemed that having anxiety or something along those lines is \"cool\" and \"in\".  Also, it seems that everybody and their uncle has some sort of \"anxiety\" these days. \n\nnot saying I do, but I hope that what I have said illustrates why I am not talking to people about it.

I do not have any medical issues or medications and I've always been really healthy. Everyone I've seen have said that they haven't heard about this kind of symptoms before and said that I should just wait it goes over.\n\nFirst I felt that my right hand feels weird, like the \"accuracy\" of the hand was not as good as before, but the strength was normal. Then soon after, my legs started to tingle. They were not numb, but tingling quite often. Later, the tingling started in my cheeks and jaw, and sometimes on the upper lip. First all this seemed completely random. I went to see a osteopath and a doctor. The osteopath said that my spine (don't know the correct word) is really tight. After the osteopath, my legs and arms started to work normal and the tingling was gone, but random muscle twitching started on legs. Also the face tingling was still there. The doctor said that this could be a random \"after symptom\" of the fewer I had couple of weeks earlier, he also said that maybe my neck muscles are tight. So he was just guessing and didn't have answers. Couple of weeks continued with random muscle twitching in legs and tingling in face and then I noticed at school that the tingling starts when I lean backwards on the chair and when I lean forward and support my head with hands on the table, the tingling goes away. After this I was quite sure that it is some kind of muscle/nerve problem in the neck and I went to a masseur. 2 hours after the neck/back massage the tingling and twitching was gone. I was really happy for 5-6 days because this was the first time in months I didn't have this sensation in my face. I also had a 5 day break from the school. Then I went back to the school and the tingling and twitching started again. The tingling is a lot less severe than before and I can only feel it when sitting or standing still. If I'm laying down, walking, at the gym etc. I'm not feeling it.\n\nThe tingling doesn't effect my life and I can function 100% normally, but I'd really like to know the reason for this and want to make sure it is not anything dangerous. The doctor, osteopath and masseur all said that they have heard of limbs tingling but not limbs and face at the same time and so randomly.\n\nIt started soon after I started a new school where I'm sitting for 7-8 hours a day with short 5 min brakes only. Couple of weeks before that, I had a cold and some fewer and I had to sleep in a sitting position to get sleep because of the bad cough. I'm thinking that this is some kind of nerve/muscle pinch in the neck region, but if I try to Google this, I only get results like Multiple Sclerosis etc. and that's not helping at all. I've tried a lot of things during this 2 month period, like dropping out caffeine. Only thing I find effecting the symptoms are the way I'm sitting and every time I do sports or lay down it disappears after a while.\n\nWhen I had the fewer, I had a really bad cough and during and after that I was having problems with breathing. My resting hearth rate was 20-30 higher than normal and I got out of breath when I walked to the kitchen. I also noticed that I'm breathing really fast and not deep. This lasted for 3-4 weeks and ended just before I started to get the tingling sensations. I didn't do any sports during that time. This could be completely unrelated.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

She has had cyclical migraines since 14yrs old that occur around spring March-May for a period of 3-6 weeks. She will always get the migraine in spring but on the occasion in the fall too, maybe the fall happens every other year. During those times these migraines come and go, lasting anywhere from 20mins-3hrs and often happen every 4-12hrs. The pain is incredibly intense behind the eyes and is a shooting pain directly to the top of her spine. It's like pushing a needle through the eyes straight back, in her words.

Before the DO, she would go to a Physical Therapist specializing in Myofascial release. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have no idea what might be the root cause for this and no one else seems to have an idea what exactly we can do to limit these migraines she receives.

This had no affect, apparently on her migraines, but left her with chronic neck pain and a 3 inch scare on the neck and where they removed her rib. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBesides the above she is currently taking gabapentin and Klonipin once a night, with a gabapentin in the morning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny thoughts what the root cause, unless this could be only the surgery + EDS, would be much appreciated or other methods to maybe make this less intense for her.

It appears all food, scaled by caloric intake, is triggering this effect in me.\n\nScale from 0 to 10 in symptom expression like so:\n\n* ***1-3*** \\- Inability to summit cognitive ability, break down things into logical chunks, keep a train of thought (i am a software engineer by trade and it is immediately apparent when this begins).\n* **4-6** \\- on top of cognitive shutdown i get slight numbness in face, very watery eyes, demotivated and disconnected from my senses.\n* **7-10**: Inability to remain awake, will fall asleep at desk / on floor if i do not make my way to bed.\n\nEating very large (caloric) meals takes me to 7-10 range in expression of symptoms.\n\nIsolated food intake to test triggers, ie 1 boiled egg or 1 serving of almonds or 1 serving of bacon or 1 can of tuna, etc. Still expression of symptoms, scaling by size of meal.\n\nDiet has become very light during day and heavy at night for me to adjust my lifestyle around my health issue. I do coffee with no milk/sugar up until 12. Then it's usually 1-2 eggs w spinach, or bran/muesli with almond milk for lunch. Very small servings. Dinner i eat large to get the bulk of my nutrients/macros in to sustain my living body. Beans/lentils/vegetables/rice/eggs mostly and meat once or twice a week. Take out once a week and do go large with serving size.\n\nExperimented heavily with diet though through this time, months on keto, going carbs only, the old 'food pyramid'. All feels the same. Even back to my original eating lifestyle (ie big breakfast big lunch small dinner) i have tried for extended periods. These periods i can hardly remember sadly, because without fasting i am starting and living my whole day in a blur.\n\n4 Blood tests in this time period. I am told i appear very healthy by the readings with slightly low testosterone as the only thing to point out. I am a little guilty of being a submissive in the presence of doctors and haven't pushed this as far as i could through them. The best i got was a referral to a dietitian with the doctors note being 'adult - fussy eating'. I didn't follow up on this and was quite shocked at the doctors low effort. I acknowledge that my immediate positive action is to see more doctors.   \n\n\nMisc points to note.\n\n* 5-6 hours of sleep a night. Has been this way since childhood.\n* Symptoms start about 40-50 mins after eating\n* Walk 4-5 km a day, workout at home 3-4 sessions a week and am in great shape\n* I don't drink alcohol. Maybe once a month. I also get the same symptoms from it.\n* Cognition is diminished, but other skills like guitar and drumming are not effected whatsoever, my ability is as per normal. These have became my go to activities for when my brain is in zombie mode.\n* Smoke weed all hours of the day apart from before and during working hours. Longest break was 6 months with 0 weed and while i experienced heaps of benefits in other aspects of life my food related symptoms remained as normal, they were harder to tolerate though! Smoking weed for 8-9 years total\n* Poo is always very spicy and painful. burns. this is fixed by including a high fibre cereal in my diet.\n* Inability to digest chilli/hot foods..but that only began when the symptoms began 5 yrs ago. 12-24 hours of stomach cramps if even the slightest chilli/hotness in meal.\n* In my diet experiments, a diet of mostly soda/candy actually had minimal symptoms. Obviously not sustainable so i had to stop.\n\nThe severity of my cognition diminishment after consuming food has almost lost me many of jobs in my industry - i have had to completely modify my lifestyle and live uncomfortably (very hungry and near fasted for 70% of the day) to accommodate for my health issues. I'm behind the desk at work and my output goes from 100% -&gt; 10% if i eat a normal meal. With my strict caloric restrictions in place, it goes to maybe 100% -&gt; 50% output.\n\nAny insight?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

(Stats - Early 20s, female, healthy weight)\n\nI used to have a fair amount of joint pain that\u2019s been gradually worsening throughout my life. Once in college, I would regularly treat it with ibuprofen. The ibuprofen offered almost total relief and I became a bit dependent on it. I started developing upper abdominal pain that would at times result in me throwing up or needing to lay down to experience relief. One day, the pain didn\u2019t go away and I ended up needing to go to the hospital. My pancreatic enzymes were really off and they said I had acute pancreatitis, but later took that diagnosis back and said I actually just had mild gastritis. They said that pancreatitis was unlikely, because I was a seemingly young healthy female without a history of alcoholism and that pancreatitis just wasn\u2019t possible - basically said the initial blood test was a false positive (I really question this logic especially given the location of my pain). After leaving the hospital, I was still struggling with the same symptoms but had completely stopped taking ibuprofen which was supposed to be the cause of my issues. \n\nI went vegan a couple of months later to see if that would help me any. It helped so much! Everything was really great for about 2 months. Then I started developing a new set of digestive problems. I didn\u2019t have the upper abdominal pain or the joint pain, but I started experiencing symptoms like severe bloating, gas and stomach pain. Before going vegan, I was very regular - never a single symptom that correlated to either of the extremes of IBS. Going vegan really changed that and it also came with the struggles of fatigue, decreased energy and strength. I was fully vegan for about a year and a half, but as of just a few weeks, I started adding eggs and seafood back into my diet because I got fed up with falling asleep at 8 pm every day. Now, my joint pain is back and I still have the same digestive issues. I\u2019ve had almost no success in talking to doctors about my issues. Not sure what\u2019s going on but I would greatly appreciate any insights you may have! \n\nOther issues to note: I\u2019ve always had a lot of trouble with eating fiber. I would avoid additional fibers at all costs, which you can\u2019t really do as a vegan. Amounts below the suggested daily intake can still be too high for me. Fiber seems to have the opposite effect on me. It creates constipation and severe bloating. \n\nI can\u2019t eat really sweet things without feeling horrible. \n\nI deal with a lot of nausea. I probably throw up at least once every week and a half or so. Sometimes for what seems like absolutely no reason. \n\nI\u2019ve always had atrocious, irregular periods.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Turning my head around 10 to 20 degrees in either direction is moderately uncomfortable, turning over 20 degrees is *very* uncomfortable for my neck. **It doesn't hurt at all,** there's absolutely no pain whatsoever, but it's quite uncomfortable and distracting. It feels \"tired\" or \"strained\" even though it really shouldn't. It feels like it takes a non-trivial amount of conscious, physical effort to look off-center; as soon I relax my neck it strongly gravitates back to center like it \"wants\" to be there.\n\nThis isn't something that becomes a problem after doing it for awhile either, glancing at the very far edge of my secondary screen for even a couple of seconds to peek at information can be a bit uncomfortable. I have always paid attention to my posture (especially the last 2 weeks), even if my posture isn't perfect it's definitely above average.\n\nI don't have a hunchback or forward neck. My monitors are 22\" and ~1.6 feet away from my face. I've tried doing neck stretches and paying extra attention to posture and relaxing. None of this helps. The problem is somehow still there and it's annoying the shit out of me, what the hell is going on?\n\n***\n\nIt's doesn't seem to be actual muscle tightness, it's not from sleeping a certain way, it's not from exercise, and it's not painful or sore. It's just a super fucking uncomfortable fatiguing feeling, like eye strain. It's hard to find anything about this, everything is about the former mentions.\n\nI like the idea of using 2 monitors but I just can't go on like this!

The x-rays were viewed by the technician who confirmed that the SIJ is unremarkable, there's no dislocation or fracture. However, he didn't confirm or deny if there are any other problems (he was a generalist not a specialist).\n\nI've included the images below - 1 image of both hips for comparison, and 3 images of the left hip.\n\nHere are the relevant details about me:\n\nFemale, 37YO, 170cm, 75kg, caucasian, UK (currently ME). No known trauma to cause pain, no unusual medical history. Current medications: OTC paracetamol as required.\n\nI've had pain in my left hip for 2 years, usually around a 5 on the pain scale (varies based on what I'm doing). Pain when walking, sitting, standing, moving - any movement of the hip. I unintentionally walk with a limp/unevenly when it's very painful. (Enough for others to notice). It's not noticeably worse or better in the morning vs the evening.\n\nHaving done some research, my symptoms don't match sciatica. The pain is very definitely located within the hip joint. It's not in my muscles, and it's not like nerve pain (which I've had before). There's no back pain or back problems. I'm actively average - I walk every day, have a desk job, do light (walking) exercise. My symptoms are more like the symptoms for hip impingement or minor misalignment - it feels like there's something inside when I'm moving the joint. I have no pain in the right leg at all. The symptoms match up more with something going on inside the joint itself.\n\nI've had the xrays done, but haven't seen a specialist, as that's prohibitively expensive. I will be going to a physotherapist, but I'd like to confirm, if possible, if there may be some issue with the joint itself. If the cartilage is being damaged then I need to know so I can limit further damage or look into fixing it.\n\nI'm very grateful for any info you can give me, and I understand that this is not a replacement for official diagnosis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/z8jyswrfs6r21.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/72xaaxsfs6r21.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/eky8wesfs6r21.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/1btywvsfs6r21.png", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I also have a pea sized movable lymph node along my jawline (also on the right side) that sometimes for no reason at all gets bigger and hurts (don't know if the two are connected). My common sense tell me that it's nothing, because I've had it for so many years, but my anxiety tells me that I have cancer. \n\nMy mom, my aunt and my grandma have thyroid issues, but I think the mass is located too high for it to be a thyroid nodule or something.

I never had any runny  nose, congestion  or breathing problems.  I basically slept all week, no  energy whatsoever.  I would wake up many times in the night feeling  overly hot, sweaty, and cold like the flu.  I also felt that my blood  sugar was low, and I would have dreams about food and candy.  I would  try and take a bite of something sugary in the middle of the night.  I  am familiar with hypoglycemia.  These hypoglycemic episodes at night are  unusual for me, but I'm hoping it's because I had no appetite all week.\n\nA  few days before I came down with these symptoms I had an extended stay  with my girlfriend and her mom who recently recovered from the flu, and I  also saw a friend who had recently recovered from a 3 week long flu.\n\nLast  week I wasn't so, little energy but I wasn't sleeping 24/7.  I tried to  go outside but was having difficulty.  In 40 degree F weather, I wore a  large winter coat and tried to go for a walk.  I became extremely hot,  little sign of sweating, and nearly fainted.  My legs started shaking, I  felt light headed and nauseated.  I managed to make it home by stopping  to rest in some little stores along the way and drinking a lot of  water.\n\nI also went out with my dad, and  just being inside the hot truck made me feel uneasy.  I nearly fainted  yet again, but felt better after drinking some water.\n\nAlso,  once after I showered I felt extremely over heated.  I was sitting in  my room in nothing but my underwear and felt ungodly hot.  Again, drank  water and it subsided.\n\nBy this point in the timeline I had regained my appetite and am not experiencing any hypoglycemic attacks at all nor at night.\n\nNow  we're at the current week.  My sleep schedule is back on track.  I  sometimes feel overheated at night, even with the AC on, though I have a  tendency to sleep with large blankets.  I'm not having hypoglycemic  episodes at night.  I am eating regularly again.  I'll have a brief wave  of nausea here and there.  I have enough energy to get stuff done  indoors.\n\nHowever, again, today I tried  to go outside on my longer walk.  I get maybe 10 minutes in and start to  feel like I could faint soon if I don't take it easy.  I sat down,  drank a bunch of water and walked home.  I didn't faint or feel light  headed on the way back, like I did the previous week.  I was dressed in  long pants and a fleece, it was probably 60 degrees outside.  I wasn't  sweating that much.  One thing I noticed was that my hands looked really  red, and it felt like I was totally exerting myself.  When I got home  my legs felt weak and shaky and I had to lay down for about an hour.  I  am thinking of going for a short walk now, writing this, but I don't  think I could get very far.\n\nI've  read that dehydration can still occur in people recovering from the flu  even when the obvious symptoms have stopped.  I've also heard that  fatigue from a flu can linger weeks after symptoms have stopped.\n\nI'm  concerned though because I've never had these sort of hot flash heat  intolerance things before.  I used to be able to walk outdoors for hours  with my water bottle in the summer time.  I don't drive, walking and  public transit is how I get around.  I was perfectly able to walk around  all day up until I became ill.  I'm worried how I'll be able to engage  in the world if this problem is something serious.\n\nI had been dealing with tremendous stress at work before this and some stress at home.  Also I don't have health insurance.\n\nIs  there hope that I am still flu recovering or is there something more  serious happening?  My symptoms have been slowly improving over time,  I'm not sure what to think.  Thank you so much!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Edit!  For what it's worth, I am the type of person to obsess and worry  over this sort of thing.  My mom, dad, and sister who see me regularly  just tell me to chill out and rest.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I've heard from friends who have had similar injuries that this very may well heal on it's own but it's pretty annoying and hasn't gotten much better over the last few days. I want to make sure this is a normal course of recovery.  The injury happened Monday night in BJJ where I got my finger caught up in the gi and when my partner went to rip my grip, it twisted up my finger. It's Thurs morning now so I'm not sure if the finger should still be bending off track. I can fully move the finger, the swelling is starting to subside but there is still discomfort when I move it and I don't want to have it heal wrong or wait it out only to find out I'll have to go to the Dr to fix it anyway.  I can get the finger to move correctly but there's some pressure in the two bendy parts of my ring finger. The knuckle feels fine and it's not so bad if I bend it and don't force it into the correct position or if I put a little pressure on the upper bend while I bend it. I can fully straighten the finger, push on it, pull on it, twist it (slightly) without too much pain, the main annoyance is that if I bend it correctly I get a sharper pain in the uppermost bend of my finger. I also get some pain there when I press my finger down or if I pull/twist on that upper bend.  I've attached a photo of my left hand so you can see that the ring finger is bending off track.  Please let me know if anyone can say for sure what the issue is or if you have a list of possibilities or ways to determine whether this is a Dr. trip or will heal on it's own. I'm using the finger now to type and can manage just fine, I'm worried about it bending off track though when I try to close my fist. Hoping that this is temporary and once it has more time to heal it will go back into position or that I can somehow fix this at home.  I've been resting it, icing it, and elevating throughout the days since it's been injured as well as taping the fingers together to force it to bend right. I can see improvement in the level of pain it's not as fast as I'd hoped and the off track bending is worrisome. It also hurts more when I try to keep it in a splint. I can feel the between joint bones and there's no break there it's mainly the uppermost bend that feels off. Any and all help is appreciated!\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/y7aapg4ymnr21.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/1noo914ymnr21.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/b0ai2c5ymnr21.jpg", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Little to no sore throat.\n\nMy job and constant talking cause me to keep using my voice. (I'm also a singer but didn't sing much or at all since the start of 2019) After going out talking loudly one night at a noisy restaurant while sick, I almost completely lose my voice. My voice is in bad condition. Coughing is violent and won't stop.\n\nWent to Emergency room. Diagnosed with Acute Bronchitis after 1 minute of examination.  \nGo on antibiotics/cough medicine. I improve but still cough frequently.\n\nFeel better after about a week. (Cold lasted 2 - 3 weeks)  \nHowever, after this cold the following symptoms have persisted for the last month:\n\n**Symptoms:**\n\n* Sinus Pressure, especially in Forehead, and having headaches about 2x a week, usually in the morning or upon waking.\n* Post Nasal drip - constant feeling in throat of mucus irritation.\n* Voice Loss - In my very upper register and mixed register, my voice is unstable and weak. Sometimes not able to hit certain notes, but the notes or my ability changes every time I try.\n\nThis lasts for the month of March, generally seeing slow improvement in my voice but not much in my postnasal drip and sinus pressure. I schedule to see an ENT ASAP (which was 2 weeks)\n\n**Visit to ENT:**\n\nI finally visit the ENT. I write my symptoms on a paper which he reads off to me. He takes a very quick look at my nose ears and throat and just says he sees irritation in my throat. . Because of my loss of voice he wants me to do Endoscopy. He says I might have vocal nodules and might need a surgery. I start crying and freaking out, because I was not expecting this to escalate that quickly. Then he says judging by my speaking voice, it's probably just a polyp or nothing at all or even allergies or something else. He wants to do an allergy test as well.\n\nHe prescribes me over the counter allergy medication. He says to come back in 2 weeks to do the Endoscopy. I ask if the allergy medication is going to help my condition and he says it will in the short term but I probably have a more serious issue.\n\nI look up the doctor online after going and see he has many 1 star reviews on yelp for misdiagnoses. ([https://www.yelp.com/biz/jean-font-md-miami](https://www.yelp.com/biz/jean-font-md-miami))\n\nI take the over the counter allergy medicine, and my symptoms are pretty much the same, and I wake up with my worst sinus headache yet.\n\nConsidering all that has happened so far, I do not trust his diagnosis, and I am looking for relief as my sinus headaches and post nasal drip continue.\n\n**Situation now:**\n\nHave endoscopy scheduled for 2 weeks from now, during another appointment with current doctor. Set up an appoint with another doctor for next Monday in case which I will attend based on feedback I receive on reddit on the legitimacy of the diagnosis of my first ENT.\n\nAllergy medicine has made my post nasal drip a bit better, and my voice as a result is a bit stronger, almost back to normal singing levels when I test, but still compromised.\n\n**TLDR:** Have had post nasal drip, sinus headaches, and loss/weakness in voice in upper register for about 6 weeks after having a cold/cough. (diagnosed as acute bronchitis) Waited weeks to go to ENT, he gives me over the counter allergy medication. Post nasal drip is a bit better, but sinus headaches persist. ENT wants to do an Endoscopy but I feel my problem is more sinus related, and feel like my ENT was generally unhelpful and I am unsure of the validity of his recommendation.\n\n**Want to know:**\n\n1. What do you think I may have given my symptoms.\n2. Should I continue going to my ENT or find another.\n\n**Stats**:\n\n* Age - 27\n* Sex - F\n* Height - 5'7\"\n* Weight - 138\n* Race - White\n* Duration of complaint - 2 Months\n* Location - Sinus pressure/headaches in Forehead, Post-nasal drip in throat.

It will itch very bad and I can\u2019t hold it any longer and so I start to itch and it gets worse and worse as soon as I start to itch until I\u2019m raw and break the skin. It even itches inside of my anus. I thought it was hemorrhoids but that\u2019s not the case. I have seen two doctors and had a colonoscopy and both have told me that it is just an \u201citching disorder\u201d nothing has helped. I have tried preparation H, fiber supplements, butt paste, antibiotic ointment, and gold bond medicated powder. I use to use the gold bond powder every day then stopped. I used to use baby wipes after every bowel movement then stopped which could be the cause I used different kinds of baby wipes. In the shower I was very diligent about washing inside and around my rectum with soap. My diet is not good and always changing. I eat out almost every day (I know I need to get my life together). I eat a lot of fast food as well. I always have eaten whatever I wanted because I always am in shape. I am very active and exercise almost every day. I also love sitting a lot even though I am very active. I love sitting on the couch and watching TV. I am very sexually active with my girlfriend. We experiment with other women and have anal sex as well. I don\u2019t really do this anymore because I am having so many problems with my anus lately. It seems to be getting worse lately. I had a genital wart or two pop up once, had it frozen off, and haven\u2019t had any stds show up since then. I did give HPV to my girlfriend before this unfortunately. I have changed my laundry detergent and soap continually so that\u2019s not the problem. I went to my chiropractor once and told him about it. He waved some metal over my head and told me to push his arm then told me I had worms and gave me a supplement and told me to stop drinking coffee. I don\u2019t go see him anymore. I thought the worms thing was a good idea though so I had my biologist girlfriend take a sample and look at it at her lab. Turns out I don\u2019t have worms. Lately I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s fungal? I do drink coffee every day also. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an STD but who really knows my doctors haven\u2019t been very helpful. I also got a bidet and have stopped washing my anus in the shower instead I try to not itch as much as possible and clean with only water.

I'm so confused and tired from these last two weeks.\n\n\nI woke up with a mild cold Thu April 4th. It might have been earlier.\nI was going through an extreme amount of stress having a girlfriend relationship issue Wed April 3rd. Almost panic attack levels. I believe this was a major factor in getting sick.\n\nThursday morning I woke up with congestion and runny nose. I played basketball in the am before work through this and tweaked my upper back. I worked Thursday and Friday with bad sinuses and chronic pain from my back. I was miserable. But I got through both days. \n\nSaturday I woke up with sore throat. There was white on my tonsils. I took Dayquil and lots of fluids. I spent a lot of time outside in the sun. I was moving at 70 percent it felt like. By throat was irritiating me and I had mild headache and fatigue. My back was recovered but I felt fatigued. I took Nyquil before bed.\n\nSunday I woke up and tried using my electric toothbrush in the back of my throat like desperate idiot trying to remove the discomfort of the sitting phlem or sinuses. My toothbrush head had a tiny bit of blood on it. I stopped. I'm sure this is a big reason why I'm in this situation now. \n\nMonday I woke up with a very sore throat and headache/toothache on the upper right side of my mouth. I went into work and tried to power through, and go home and sleep this off, took Nyquil again. That night I woke up at 130am. And could not sleep until 530am. I was lying down with my eyes closed, getting too hot and too cold with sheets. I never experience insomnia. This is my first time experiencing it. \n\nI took off from work Tuesday. Had really bad headache bodyache and fever. I made a phone visit to my doctor explaining that I had seen white on the back of my throat. Asking for antibotics. He said I should come in to get a cotton swab, until I mentioned my headaches/toothaches. He told me its theres a toothaches its a moot point, well just move forward with the antibotics and that I needed to see my dentist. I picked up antibiotics and figured the nyquill gave me the insomnia as an adverse reaction. Went home and experienced more fever symptoms.\n\nWednesday I actually slept okay and came into work with sore throat, and mile body aches. Went home, kept taking antibiotics. Lots soup and tea, no caffene. I slept horribly. I kept waking up coughing or being unable to fall back asleep.\n\nIt happened Thursday night too. \n\nMy headaches are constant, from the lack of sleep I figure. My eyes are killing me. I can't think striaght. I have lapses of fever. \n\nI also found out a coworker who I got sick was diagnosed with the Flu. And if that's the case I've read antibotics can be detrimental.\n\nAny any any any any suggestions for how I can sleep well agian. \n\nI am desperate to stay asleep for 6 hours straight.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I went to the hospital for a panic attack, and continually had them from then on, and now less often but still very much there. \n\nLately, specifically within the past month, I have been very spacey. I talked with my therapist and was told it was dissociating, and I was taught how to attempt to ground myself. I went a week going through mild dissociation every once in a while. I forgot what people were telling me, but otherwise it wasn\u2019t a big deal. I told my therapist, then the next week I didn\u2019t dissociate, or at least I don\u2019t remember doing so. I usually don\u2019t remember any days previous to the one I\u2019m going through very well, but I\u2019m still able to sometimes come up with things I did.

It was the worst dissociation I\u2019ve ever had, it felt like another me if I had to explain it. Like a different personality, more childish than I usually am, but it still /seemed/ like I had control over myself. I, for no reason, felt like I wanted to cry at random times, and I kept repeating sentences because I had forgotten I asked them. Or I had to keep asking what my girlfriend said because it just went in one ear and out the other. \n\nThere are so many things I don\u2019t understand, why it randomly picked up after a week of not happening, why this is starting when I\u2019m already so old.

So it is a iron deficiency anemia.) \n\n  \n  A week after starting with the iron pills her state really worsened. Instead of the usual fatigue she has had all her life, she now starts showing dizziness, nausea, sometimes even a tinnitus, difficulties concentrating. The most prominent symptom being muscle weakness which sets in after only very light exercise or just doing things in general. Some days she cannot do much more than laying on the couch and rest. She now also tents to forget things rather fast.

And instead of helping, things just got a lot worse for her. \n\n  \n  I do have the feeling that the doctor does not really listen to her and going there again and being dealt with in a rush does not seem like something we can do every week again and again.

Don't smoke, drink recreationally. No prior known medical issues or medication. 25 mg of antenolol daily since November. I take a probiotic multivitamin every day. I work a high stress job that has me working long hours consecutively and on weekends. History of autoimmune disorder on mom's side of the family (lupus). I would describe myself as a highly anxious person living in a fairly consistent state of agitation. The addition of a newborn into our lives this past September has increased my stress and workload (although she is a blessing to be sure). \n\nI am a musician, and I first realized something was wrong Sept. 2017 when my hands became easily fatigued and hot (physically warm to the touch) after playing piano 10+ minutes. A gamer all my life, I could barely play more than 5 or 10 minutes without noticing. Went to the doc, they did x-rays, and MRI and an arthritis panel, all of which came back clear. Sent me to the hand doc. Positive Tinel's sign at the wrist in both hands (still positive to this day). He referred me to a neurologist for an EMG/nerve conduction study which showed MILD irritation of the median nerve - he diagnosed mild carpal tunnel, but admitted my symptoms were not textbook carpal tunnel. He said my options were: wait and see if it goes away, take Lyrica, or have the carpal release surgery. I chose option one. It hasn't improved, though it seems to get better sometimes and worse others. I'm aware of it every time I type or play piano. I've given up video games.\n\nIt's Spring 2018, and I notice myself more fatigued than usual. Extreme, incapacitating exhaustion that affects my thinking (\"brain fog\"), memory and ability to form sentences sometimes. I went in to the PCP, took some blood tests, and they said my thyroid numbers were showing hyperthyroid. I went to the endocrinologist who ran just about every blood test he could think of, and told me my numbers were far from classic hyper. He said my T3 and T4 were elevated, but my TSH was normal, not low as hyperthyroid classically presents. An antibody test showed I was positive for Hashimoto's, but negative for Graves, which again is abnormal with elevated T3/T4. He wants an MRI of my pituitary to see if there's a tumor secreting TSH. I get it done, he says there's a small speck that could be a tumor but we don't know for sure, could be an anomaly in the picture. I'm scheduled for a second MRI in June to see if it grew - if it is, obviously it's a tumor. Finally, he had me do a full thyroid scan (nuclear pill test) - which after all this came back showing evidence of MILDY elevated thyroid levels. He noticed my pulse was high, put me on atenolol 25 mg daily, and said, \"See you in June.\" This was last December. He suggested maybe I look for a second opinion. $1500, five specialists, two years and 0 answers later, you can understand why I chose not to.\n\nThere are other issues too that I don't know if they're real or imagined. I feel buzzing or tingling feelings on my face sometimes. Lately, I've been dealing with foot problems similar to the ones with my hands. Sometimes when putting on socks and I touch a particular part of my ankle I feel that \"electric\" shock feeling that I remember from my hands - nerve irritation. When rocking side to side shifting weight from foot to foot, I feel nerve irritation in my underside of my left foot, where my arches are. When I get very stressed my chest tightens and becomes restrictive. I swear I feel a pain in my lower left abdomen (feels like rib pain), but an X ray showed nothing was wrong. I have muscle twitching all the time. My left eye has been twitching since March 2018. I did see a neurologist, and I didn't share all of this with him admittedly because it all sounds so crazy. He encourage me to continue with the carpal tunnel surgery. My next doctors appointment is with a rheumatologist. I set it up because it was the only specialist I hadn't seen. \n\nThis brings us to today. The past two months I've lost about 50% of my taste and maybe 25% of my smell. I thought it was just caused by a bad sinus infection from early March or the weather change, but taste and smell aren't returning even a month later after full course of antibiotics and taking a daily antihistamine. Could be a red herring, but thought I would mention it.\n\nI feel like a crazy person. Before this, I hadn't been to a doctor in ten years. Now I go every ten weeks, and never get any concrete answers.  I'm always \"not quite textbook.\" This is affecting my relationship with my wife (an ER nurse) because I talk about it a lot. It's especially hard when you're someone who lives in an almost constant state of anxiety - it's hard not to think about it, not to do endless hours of Google diving, reading research papers and coming up with obscure theories but never really knowing what's wrong. The good news: it's not an emergency. I'm not dying, I have all of my limbs and I can work and function. But I'm definitely not living the quality of life I had when I was 25, and I'm scared that 35 will be even worse.\n\nPlease let me know if anything you read here rings a bell.

The next day felt uncomfortable in chest but a lot less intense so I stopped smoking for a week and felt perfectly fine for a couple days then smoked and immediately back to the feeling and been fighting very slight uncomfortable feeling in chest past couple days.\n\nEdit: I have had loss of appetite. And also my life has been pretty stressful recently even though I\u2019m pretty care free I talk a lot to myself about things that irritate me but I rarely show emotion. I am never smoking marijuana again after these experiences.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Any ideas and what to do now?", "author": "Soulfire328", "self_text": "So let\u2019s preface this. For the past week maybe to idono I wasn\u2019t paying to much attention. I\u2019d get like a light or tight pain right where my heart is. Only for a few minutes. Then would go away. Happened once after I ate popcorn and once after I ate peanuts. Both relatively salty but has happened other times without anything like that . Also a very dull headache from time to time at the front of my head for the same amount of time. Also have been very drowsy taking a nap or two a day.\n\nSo last night I\u2019m climbing into bed around mid night and I have a lot of tell tale sighs of a heart attack. I\u2019m certified lifeguard and woofer so I know what to look out for.  That pain over my heart is back. A muscle in my neck locked up. I feeling nauseous, become incredibly anxious. So I scoot on down to the ER they take an EKG X-Ray and an blood lab. My chest stopped hurting around the time of the EKG idono if that affects it.  Sat in the waiting room for a few hours and most of the symptoms got better or let up entirely. Pain around my heart comes back now and then. Once or twice it came back but on the right side. Like if your heart was on the right not the left it was where the heart would be.\n\nResults come back doc says everything looks fine I\u2019m good. Go home sleep for 3 hours then get up and go to class.\n\nAfter class I went to the gym and used the elyptical for 30 minutes at a high rate (enough to have sweat running down my shirt and breathing hard) and felt relatively fine\n\n\nNow all day to day the throb around my heart comes and goes. I plan to go see a cardiologist but that\u2019s gonna take some time and this has me kinda worried.  Other than that no other symptoms.  Sometimes the pain will swell a little bit if I purposfully take as deep as s breath as possible but only sometimes. Maybe it pulled a muscle at the gym or got really really bad heartburn? I have no idea \n\nIdono if this matters at all but I\u2019m fairly athletic run several miles a day and lift for at least an hour a day and an 23 so on the list of people to get a heart attack I\u2019m pretty low on the list( but still possible)\n\nI also know low blood pressure runs on my dad\u2019s side of the family though idono if I have it.\nAdditionally this was a year or two  ago so idono what it is now but at one point my lying heart rate was 38 because of all the aerobic I did which could also contribute to low blood pressure.\n\nAny help would be nice to set my mind at ease. What it is. Steps to take. I got finals I need to worry about I don\u2019t need to worry about my heart potentially clogging up.\nThank you!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

{"post_id": "be2lui", "created_utc": 1555468338, "title": "Itching, burning skin.", "author": "notimportantlikely", "self_text": "For ELEVEN long years I've had vulval pain, on and off and no specialist or doctor has seen any issue with it. The skin always looked healthy and my tests came back inconclusive, they usually suspected a yeast infection over anything else. I always worried I might have herpes, but there was never a sore for the doctors to examine or test, and they refused to do a blood test, as I carry the virus, and had a cold sore as a child. (and suspect I also do as an adult too without any real way to ID them) So I've never been able to confirm it either way, leading into suffering and questions now as below...\n\nI've seen multiple gynecologists, a dermatologist, a many, many general practitioners and they all say I look healthy. I've had swabs, which came back inconclusive, visual examinations which I \"passed\" with flying colours. Basically I've been branded as a little bit anxious, despite going in with a clear mind and explaining my very real symptoms. Anytime the pain became unbearable, or I had a heavier or unusual discharge, i'd treat myself for a yeast infection as usual...it never really went away but it would relax a bit as usual.\n\nWhile this discomfort continued...\n\nAbout four years ago I started to get itchy skin, my legs were the first spots to itch, especially around and behind my knees, then it started to spread all over the place. There wasn't a rash, usually, just itching and then the spots or irritation would come later. My skin is very dry, and not a lot seems to help that. So it was suspected I just had the itch scratch response. Overall my skin doesn't look too bad, unless I've scratched the areas open. It moved around, some places itch more than others, or some not at all. Locations calm down and then other go off. I get crawling, tingling sensations, but nothing visible. For a few years, it was mostly my legs bothering me, thighs, armpits and under my breasts. These are all still present, but milder than before.\n\nBut now my genitals and my anal area, along with up the crease of my bottom ITCH like mad, (for what feels like the past two plus years now) usually with touch or pressure, (toilet paper or clothes and heat) and not constant or all day. Mostly night time, waking me in the night, but sometimes the day as well. It's really up to fate. Along with the vulval burning, which feels like sunburn (I also liken it to the sensation of having sand and gravel in my pants) I have itching in differing locations, too. I've noticed I  have lumps and bumps very recently, and i'm not sure if that's from scratching through my clothes or something else. (going to the doctor AGAIN today to show them)\n\nWeirdest thing, is I have these spells where the pain is suddenly horrible. Like day to day I have discomfort, I adjust my clothes or change my sitting position but it isn't too much to deal with. Other days suddenly the pain is bad, I feel genuinely unwell, I can't concentrate on anything but the discomfort. I feel dizzy, nauseous, lose my appetite for days on end, feel lethargic, and just off colour. I had a horrible burning pain in my back, around the middle near my spine. Being in the car was torturous it was so uncomfortable. My bowel is a bit upset. (could be normal) My memory becomes terrible, I feel dehydrated and hungover and just overall crap. It's that feeling of knowing you need water, but feeling like you can't get it down either. Food and water stay down, but getting them in feels like an effort. I also feel quite warm, but the weather is warm right now so might not be relevant. Since Sunday to Wednesday I've had the discomfort, went to bed Sunday feeling sore, the pain peaking on Tuesday morning, and then relaxing that afternoon...when the pain was overridden by the pain of my mouth, my lips suddenly burning just as badly as my privates were previously. Yep. Suddenly my vulva feels better, and my mouth is hurting. That burning has continued to today. My mouth, just the lips feel hot, are basically pulsing. They are red, but nothing too serious looking. I often get red lines around the edges of my lips which are present but not severe.\n\nI also have pain in my nose, my chin and cheeks burn a little, along with my eyes feeling sore (and sometimes appearing a little red) as well.\n\nMy assumption is either herpes virus EVERYWHERE, or I have an allergy. I ate almond chocolates on Sunday, which isn't a super regular thing for me. I do eat them, but usually less.\n\nThis isn't the first time this has happened, so I worry these are outbreaks, and no doctor has caught it. And they won't or can't test for it. I'm asking for an allergist referral and for a swab...AGAIN.\n\nAge: 31, female, white, no medications.

Still Experiencing Concerning Symptoms and God a Blood Test Back That Makes Me Fear COPD or Some Form of Progressive Lung Disease.", "author": "Kilharae", "self_text": " \n\nThis is a duplicate of what I posted yesterday in /r/askDocs.  Unfortunately, no response there, so thought I would try here.\n\nWhen I got these results back, the doctors indicated nothing was wrong. Which concerns me because the doctor that examined me seemed to hand-wave the possibility of COPD and I feel like some of these blood results could actually point back in that direction.\n\nHere's the relevant results:\n\nRBC Reference (4.5 - 5.8 M/uL) Result: 5.86 Slightly Elevated\n\nMCV Reference (83.0 - 98.0 fL) Result: 75.8 Low\n\nMCH Reference (28-33.2 pg) Result: 24.7 Low\n\nRDW Reference (11.6-14.4%) Result: 14.9 Slightly Elevated\n\nFrom what I've researched, all these measurements tend to indicate that my red blood cells are smaller and less effective than normal, which is usually described as microcytic anemia, which is apparently very common in people who suffer from COPD.\n\nSince I quit smoking marijuana, I've experienced shortness of breath and a rapid heart rate (which I can't figure out if its caused by generalized anxiety - which I have, or some sort of heart / lung disorder. I've quit for about six weeks now and I still cough up phloem occasionally, especially in the morning, (but I sleep with my mouth open so I'm not sure if that's the cause).\n\nIn the past week I've been to the doctor (the one that hand-waved my COPD concerns), the emergency room where I got additional blood tests, an X-Ray that came back normal and an EKG with a sinus tachycardia rhythm, that was otherwise normal. The ER doctors just assumed the fast heart rate was due to stress. I've also gone to a cardiologist that gave me another EKG that came back normal. By BP in this period has ranged pretty wildly from around 140 / 88 to around 160 / 100. But its starting to look like I have high blood pressure (another sign of COPD)\n\nI have an appointment with a pulminologist scheduled Monday to try to determine definitely whether I have COPD but I've been so scared about it that I actually tried to perform a spirometry test on myself and determine if my FEV1/FVC ratio indicated a restrictive or obstructive lung disease.\n\nI know it sounds silly, but I essentially used a balloon and a conversion guide for converting the diameter / circumference of a balloon in centimeters to an equivalent cubic volume of air. The guide I used can be found here:\n\n[http://www2.d125.org/science/secure/wood/anatomy/ch16/lungcapacitylab.pdf](http://www2.d125.org/science/secure/wood/anatomy/ch16/lungcapacitylab.pdf)\n\nI also measured other values found in the guide I just linked including:\n\nVital Capacity, Expiratory Reserve Volume and Tidal Volume. Vital Capacity is essentially the same as FVC so I found I was within normal levels for that. Expiratory Reserve was also approximately normal. I found tidal volume to be just about impossible to accurately measure with a balloon, because I was instructed to exhale normally, and any normal exhale wouldn't create the pressure necessary to significantly blow up a balloon. Still, I made my best 'guess' over about a dozen attempts (translating a normal exhale into an equivalent pressurized exhale with an equal volume of air. I wasn't really able to relate any of these measurements (Save Vital Capacity) to any sort of COPD prognosis, so lets move on.\n\nI understand that my FVC has to be within 80% of the reference for my height and weight. In addition to the FEV1/FVC ratio being greater than 70% to not be considered to have COPD.\n\nSo I'm a 6' 2 1/2\", 34 year old male. That puts the reference for my FVC at around 5450 mL. Based on multiple max inhalation exhalation attempts averaged out on a balloon, I determined my FVC to be about 5300 - 5400 mL. Which is well within 80% of the reference (its about 96 - 99%).\n\nSince balloons present too much resistance to get an accurate measure of FEV1, I worked backwards to determine it. Again, I performed the test multiple times to achieve an average. I maximally inhaled, exhaled forcefully for one second into the air and used the rest of the air in my lungs to fill up a balloon. Using the same circumference / diameter to cubic volume conversion chart, I determined that after forcefully exhaling for 1 second, my remaining breathe was able to fill up a balloon to approximately 1200 mL. I figured, subtracting the cubic volume of air from a balloon I was able to fill up after forcefully exhaling for one second, would get me my FEV1 Value. Which in this case is (5300 to 5400 - 1200) or 4,100 to 4,200.\n\nSo the possible FEV1/FVC ratios are as follows: (4,100 mL / 5,300 mL) = 77.35%. And (4,200 mL / 5,400 mL) = 77.8%. Both would result in FEV1/FVC ratios significantly higher than the 70.6% threshold for COPD (88% of the 'normal' 80% FEV1/FVC ratio). Since these ratios are lower than 80% I figured I probably didn't need to worry too much about restrictive lung disorders either. I know there are additional measurements for FEF25/75 that are factors, but I simply couldn't devise a way to determine values at such small time intervals with balloons, so I had to forgo that measurement. Since I don't have a machine that could determine oxygen / carbon monoxide exchange levels, I was unable to determine my DLCO/VA numbers either.\n\nWhen I first performed this test, it helped me put myself at ease and at least tell myself, that the resulting FEV1/FVC ratio made it very unlikely that I had COPD. However, since reviewing the results of my blood test that I got back earlier, I've begun to question that result. It seems like my MCV / MCH is significantly low and my RBC and RDW are slightly elevated. My research has shown me that COPD is often responsible for increasing RBC levels, a decrease in MCV and MCH tend to indicate anemia. One way to get anemia is to not get enough oxygen rich blood, which can be caused by COPD. Lastly my elevated RDW levels would seem to point to anemia as well. I wouldn't be afraid of anemia if I didn't think it was possibly the result of COPD. But for the life of me, I can't see how my iron deficiency would come from anything else. Until recently, I ate plenty of red meat. In the past week, I've completely shifted my diet to mostly plant based / low sodium / low sugar / no caffeine. I've also been working out in the cardio range for at least a half an hour a day (I can do about 10 - 15 minutes of peak before tiring out). I'm just so terrified that its too late, and I'll be saddled with a progressive disease that will reduce my quality of life and then kill me.\n\nIs it possible that my low MCV / MCH figures are the result of poor, but potentially restorable lung function that can be obtained after waiting longer for my cilia to repair? I read it can take up to nine months for your cilia to fully repair.\n\nOr is it possible that I could have passed the FEV1/FVC ratio test and related reference values and still have COPD? Would this imply an early stage of COPD?\n\nI know this is a wall of text, but this has been on my mind for the past two weeks driving me totally nuts, and it took so long to get an appointment with a pulmonary specialist that actually had a spirometry test. I feel like I need help from some actual professionals to keep me from getting too far off base until my appointment on Monday.\n\nReally, please, any responses will be appreciated greatly.\n\nThanks for your time!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

(it is much better now after taking Gabapentin for \\~2 months)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;By \"lower abdomen\" I mean the pain is described as \"behind the pubic bone\", but it is hard to tell if it's definitely bladder, or maybe  something else.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The pain always intensifies in the evening.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Usually in the morning (7-8am) there is no pain at all. It intensifies after 12pm, and becomes unbearable after 4-6pm.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The pain makes it hard to fall asleep.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The pain intensifies after taking a shower (cool or hot water, no difference).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;After urinating it sometimes gets better and sometimes gets worse - randomly.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Regular painkillers do not help at all (e.g. paracetamol, ketoprofen, metamizole, ibuprofen,...)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The period of pain usually lasts for about one week.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;After a period of pain, there is usually about one week period of no pain at all, or almost no pain.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It \\*might\\* be related to menstruation cycle, but it seems rather random.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At first we suspected it could be some infection. Furaginum and some other \"basic\" stuff was involved, but it  didn't help much and the pains became worse, so we went to a  gynecologist. Gyn suggested a few things, including fungus, my gf  took a lot of different meds, pills, including antibiotics, was tested  for different kinds of fungi, bacteria, etc, but nothing was 100%  certain, and no pills helped. The condition was progressively getting  worse. We visited a few other gyns to see if they would have other ideas. We then switched to an urologist (professor), who diagnosed her with bladder leukoplakia through cystoscopy. The leukoplakia was  investigated further and identified as metaplasia with no signs of displasia (I am sorry if I am using incorrect terms, I only know these  names in Polish).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Had laparoscopy in a hospital where they removed a small ovarian cyst, but most probably it was not related in any way to the main issue and it did not result in any improvement.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I do not want to suggest anything, but right now we are suspecting it could be a damaged nerve.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I would like to ask you:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What do you think this could be?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What further diagnosis do you suggest?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What further examination do you suggest?

(what are the specific ways to diagnose it, specific examination types)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The fact that I am writing here shows how frustrated and disappointed we both are after so much time looking for answers and being in pain.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thank you very, very, very much in advance for ANY feedback you can provide.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Since then, these symptoms have gradually gotten worse over time to where i can no longer do any sports, can hardly walk, and have trouble breathing when lying down. Also, even the slightest consumption of alcohol makes symptoms a lot worse, not immediately, but with a delay of +-2days.

Sometimes feeling like something is stuck in my throat\n* Tight/pressure feeling between shoulder blades\n* Inability to exercise, symptoms worsen significantly upon physical exertion\n* Easily tired\n* Bad recovery (used to be a track athlete, monitored my heart rate (recovery) for several years. Seems significantly worse now).\n\nI never had any troubles with anxiety, but this was the first 'diagnosis' i got. Since then i've seen 3 independent therapists/psychiatrists, all of which have cleared me for any mental health issues after 20+ sessions with each of them. During treatment I was given Zoloft for 4 months and Xanax for several weeks after. Neither of them had any effect on symptoms.\n\nAdditionally i've had an extensive medical work-up;\n\n\\- Heart:\n\n* Standard stress test\n* Cardiopulmonary exercise test\n* Electrocardiogram\n* Echocardiogram\n* Perfusion MRI\n* Intrusive coronarography\n* Chest CT\n\nThe most noteworthy conclusions here were a dilated left atrium, extremely low VO2-max despite having a very active lifestyle shortly before symptoms started and a flattening O2-pulse and disproportionally increasing heart rate at the anaerobic threshold during cardiopulmonary exercise test.\n\n\\- Gastroenterological\n\n* 2x endoscopy\n* Manometry\n* 24h ph test\n\nThese revealed relatively mild GERD and a small hiatal hernia. After treatment with pantomed 40mg for several weeks these issues resolved, but symptoms stayed the same.\n\n\\- Lungs\n\n* Tested for asthma, negative\n\n\\- Brain, neurology\n\n* Bran MRI\n* Several other test for neurological diseases.\n\nAll normal.\n\n\\- Muskoskeletal\n\n* Several chiropractors, physiotherapists.\n\nWas checked and treated by several therapists.

Ruled out hyperventilation as a cause.\n* Followed several courses focused on breathing (mindfullness, meditation).\n\nMy doctors have been wonderful and provided my with an extensive medical workup. However they don't know where to turn next. My situation is still deteriorating to where i had to quit my job and moved back in with my parents as i can no longer take care of myself.

I would go to the doc but I just moved to Australia and my health insurance isn't active yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a 27 Female, 65 kilos, 6 ft 5 in. I have been a tobacco smoker for 8 years but have been vaping for the last one year (so 9 years in total of smoking). I don't have any previous medical issues (other than some asthma) or have taken any medication for any mental health relations. I have experienced some trauma in the past however. There has been schizophrenia, bipolar, and autism in my family (don't think that would be relevant to know but just in case). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo to give a tiny bit of background context, I was living in the UAE for 22 years and my boyfriend and I decided to move to Australia on a one year visa to convert a van and have a little adventure for a year. Since moving here, neither of us have found work, there's so many unexpected issues with building the van (we have been here 3 months, and we are still working on it), my life's savings are basically disappearing before my eyes and on top of all that of course I am home sick. My boyfriend and I are getting into some bad fights because we feed off each other's stress. But I know once the van is done and we find some work things will get better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, so the night before last night I was falling asleep, I don't know if I was even actually asleep or just in a very deep thought but suddenly my eyes involuntarily opened and I had this huge wave of fear come over me, I was hallucinating a little bit but unsure what I was seeing, and I had no idea where I was. This only lasted a few seconds. I shrugged it off thinking it was some weird nightmare or something and went back to sleep no problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen last night, again as I'm trying to fall asleep, my eyes just open on their own and I am absolutely terrified. It's like this crashing wave comes over me and I feel light-headed and my heart is pounding. Again, goes away in just a matter of seconds. This happened repeatedly maybe about 10 times throughout the night for hours. After the first 5 times, eventually I was able to almost fall asleep but then feel the wave of fear crash over my body again but this time I had control of my eyes, I didn't open them. So this kept happening for a while. Each time I tried to fall back asleep thinking positive thoughts only, things I'm looking forward to, but to no avail. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn one hand it feels like I can't move when I'm having these but it's hard to even try because I'm scared and trying to understand and make sense as to what's happening to my brain first, and they happen so quickly I barely have time to react. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday I feel a bit dizzy, some pressure in my head (but no headache or painful or anything), it's just as though I can feel that my brain feels \"off\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI read up on sleep paralysis, night terrors, nocturnal panic attacks, and I'm just confused on what this could be exactly because there are some symptoms that are similar but not all. Given all the stress lately I'm sure it's the core contributing factor, but have also read there could be underlying mental issues that could cause this as well...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyone able to shine some better clarity here? Any tips for preventing these attacks, or whatever they are? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you, appreciated.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

No preexisting medical conditions except ADHD which I take 30mg Adderall XR for. \n\nI have been out of the Marines since 2015, didn't have any back injuries while in, or before. I have been detailing cars since I got out, and early February of 2018, about an hour after I finished my shift, I got an extreme stabbing pain in between my shoulder blades while sitting at a red light in my car(definitely in my back, not in the center or near my chest). I have good posture, comfortable seats, wasn't feeling any discomfort the second before, wasn't twisting or moving at all, just sitting still waiting for the light to change. This prompted taking a few days off of work until I felt fine, then back to work. It happened again a few weeks later, then a week or so later. After the third time, my job made me go to a doctor before I could come back to work. They did blood work, and x-rays, and didn't find anything. About a week later, I was helping my SO move in and fell while carrying a box in, which spiked the pain between my shoulders, and sent the pain shooting down my back and into my legs. The pain going down into my legs stopped within a couple hours, but the back pain did not. I returned to work, but was only able to work for an hour before the pain was unbearable. Since then I have not worked. With little to no activity, I wake up with a 4-6 stabbing pain in between my shoulders, and throughout the day, it travels into my lower back as a radiating pain, while still stabbing in between my shoulders, while increasing up to around an 8. \n\nI went through my insurances spine clinic, who did all sorts of blood work, x-rays, and two MRI's. Nothing was found in any of them(no nerve impingement, fractures, disc problems, etc), except a vertebral hemangioma in my T5. We tried to find any other reason for the pain, but found none. That led to two epidural nerve blocks, one lasting 8ish hours, the other lasting around 30 minutes, without telling me which was which to test to see if the relief I got was placebo or not. It proved that it was not placebo, so I was referred to a neurosurgeon, who said that he didn't think it was the source of my pain, and did a bone scan which showed that the hemangioma was no more active than the rest of the vertebrae. So now I'm stuck with the diagnosis of chronic thoracic pain. \n\nI have a high pain tolerance thanks to the Marines, and the pain from this has brought my life to a stand still, unable to do all of the things that make me happy. If anybody has any ideas of things to look into, or anywhere to go from here, I have the insurance to be able to pursue it. I can also provide any more details needed.

First a little of backstory:\n\nSince January I've made the decision to have a healthier life style, and I've been doing so until now. I used to be someone who was getting over weight and through many efforts and sacrifices I've lost tons of wight. I don't skip any meals but I try to eat smaller portions and better (my only rule was to avoid any kind of refined flour and sugar oh and carbohydrates), I have around 3 or 4 meals throughout the day. Since last week I've noticed some decrease in the number of times I need to do number 2 (used to go 3 times after each meal every day). Like I said since last week Im lucky if I go twice, some days I can't go at all, recently and thanks to some laxatives I go 4 or 5 times in some mornings. Also I've noticed a lack of consistency in my evacuations, they used to look like sausages but now they look like cookie crumbles and when I flush them they dissolve like powder. When I used to eat lots of cereals, probiotics and vegetables they looked like pieces of sponges. This week I changed to my older habits, since I thought my healthier diet was  affecting my bowels in some sort of negative way. But nothing changed. I'm a little scared to be honest, I read online that it could be IBS. But I've never had that to begin with. I've tried many laxatives with different grades of success (like ciruelax, dulcolax, magnesium \"milk\").  today I had 4 evacuations and I didn't take any laxatives last night. What could it be? Is it just constipation? Is it possible that I'm taking longer to produce poop and therefore to evacuate it?.

Also that I'm a 22 year old fit male who has a history of panic attacks, anxiety, derealization, and brain fog.\n\nI randomly came down with non pulsatile bilateral tinnitus about 7 months ago. This was accompanied with some dizziness and occasional bouts of confusion that I chalked up to being a stress response/panic. I went to the hospital because I had a severe mental breakdown cause I was under the assumption I had a brain tumor. As soon as the idea of me having a brain tumor popped into my mind I started to get extreme pressurized feeling in my head(I have a history of panic/anxiety.) At this hospital they did a CBC, Urine test, and a CT scan without contrast.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey didn't find anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a few days and I get started on a prescription of 100mg of sertraline. I felt amazing and full of life like I never had before, but begin to get new and concerning symptoms that I originally chalked up to being odd antidepressant symptoms but are still here 3 months after quitting them. I began to see black spots in my vision, see massive cobwebs of floaters in my vision, seeing light afterimages that last far longer than they should, and a numb feeling that comes from between my eyebrows and goes down the center(or sometimes right side) of my nose. I began to struggle to see as much in the dark and noticed that my pupils were very dilated. I went to my doctor about these issues and he urged me to quit taking sertraline cold turkey and to start on wellbutrin instead. I quit the sertraline and decided I wanted nothing else to do with antidepressants so I did not take any wellbutrin. What I originally chalked up as withdrawal syndrome from the antidepressants turns out to be a mystery case to me now as I am now nearly 3 months off the antidepressants that I only took for a single month and am still experiencing the above symptoms(besides the pupil dilation.) As time has gone on these symptoms I've been experiencing seem to have gotten a bit worse, on top of a few new symptoms (Impulsive feelings, absolutely demolished appetite, and occasional bouts of constipation, had a weird one yesterday where it felt like objects were moving away from me.)\n\nI understand how easily all of this can be equated to some anxiety reaction maybe, but I find that hard to believe because until just very recently I had become more calm than ever. I quickly grew to cope with the tinnitus, believed that my symptoms were the result of coming off antidepressants, and had good friends to help me feel better. For a time I even came to terms with the idea of death(which I no longer am now that I recently found so much to love.)\n\nSorry for the verbal diarrhea. I'm just so sad and afraid now. I feel like my doctor has been extremely dismissive of my issues(albeit he did grant me some help, such as feeling for an enlarged spleen which I thankfully do not have.) I'm sick of being brushed to the side and expecting to find answers by digging through the internet which just keeps telling me I have some life ending issue.\n\nPlease help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Something to take note of is I've been in a situation somewhat similar to this one before. When I was 13 I experienced brain fog which I presumed to be a brain tumor and was found to be nothing. I have 10 times the symptoms I had back then but could it be because I'm a more avid thinker now? These antidepressants ripped me out of my brain fog and derealization. Could it be that I'm now coping with ordinary emotions again and am feeling overwhelmed? It's hard to imagine exactly what it is cause like I said before, even when I am in a peaceful state the symptoms are still apparent. A lot to consider I guess.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

The pain isn't unbearable but it is rather annoying and can be distracting when I am at work or performing my day-to-day tasks. I haven't been to the doctor's in years and recently filled out paperwork to get a Primary Care Physician, but I did see Urgent Care around 3 weeks ago regarding this testicular pain and was ordered a blood test, urine test &amp; testicular ultrasound; however everything came back normal for all three tests.\n\nSince this issue has occurred, I have masturbated around 5 times and each time I have experienced painful ejaculation, which I have seen to be a symptom of prostatitis, alongside testicular pain. At random, not very often, I also experience a shooting pain in my anal region that quickly disappears as soon as it comes. This has happened on a few occasions a few months before the testicular pain occurred.\n\nThe testicular pain subsided for around a week or two but came back within these past few days and I want to see if I can get some more clarification before my Primary Care Physician can get me in for a new patient exam, where I will describe all of the issues I have been having to them. I am not using Reddit as a substitution for a doctor, but rather a supplement while I am waiting for a doctor's appointment; I want to see if I can narrow down the issue and come in ready with more info.\n\nThank you for any help you can provide!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

It wasn't enough to stop me from doing anything, and it only lasted a day or two.  After this, my stomach began to hurt.  Over the course of a day or two the pain seemed to migrate to my diaphragm, up into my lungs, then up to the top of my trachea and into my upper back.  My doctor had me take Motrin, and the pain went away.  These first few symptoms didn't really return.\n\nOver the next month, I developed some of the symptoms I have today.  I started getting a dropping feeling in my chest, and I began to feel like I couldn't take a deep breath.  One day, I was awoken in from my sleep with a rapid heart rate and a feeling of soreness throughout my body.  I went to the ER for this and they found nothing.\n\nA month later, my symptoms had not resolved, and I ended up going into the ER again, this time for a weakness that came over me just before lunch.  This time, they drew a pair of very low phosphorous readings and admitted me to the hospital.  They immediately gave me phosphorous, and when they checked again, my phosphorous was very high.  This surprised them, and after monitoring it for several days and running more tests, they eventually decided the phosphorous draws in the ER may have been bad and released me.\n\nMy symptoms persisted, and I followed up with a nephrologist, who had me take vitamin D and monitor phosphorous.  Over several months, my phosphorous level occasionally dipped below normal but was never too bad, yet my symptoms remained.  I also saw a pulmonologist and a gastroenterologist, both of whom found little (except GERD).\n\nIn September, I developed leg weakness and saw a cardiologist.  Because I'd had a clean heart monitor and echocardiogram by that point, they ran a stress test, which also returned clean.\n\nI began to develop a worsening numbness in October/November, and by December I saw a neurologist and rheumatologist.  They both ran some tests and decided that I wasn't their concern.\n\nMy roommate is also feeling ill, with some symptoms that are similar to mine, but without as much rapid heart rate.  She has feeling worse than me.  She has directed me to try some holistic doctors, as well as a Lyme specialist.  The Lyme specialist ran a test that said I have Baronella and has been giving me antiobiotics in two week \"pulses\" at at time.  These pulses are the only thing I've tried that might have some correlation with my symptoms, but it's tough to tell because my symptoms often come and go.  Most of the doctors I've seen are skeptical of it.\n\nRecently, I've seen a Cleveland Clinic neurologist who is having me to some simple physical therapy to try to improve my spine and posture.  They started this because they noticed some difference in strength between my left and right side, though I never personally noticed it.  The therapy seems to be helping with that, but it seems like no one involved believes it's going to help with most of my symptoms.\n\nIt's been a year and two months since this started, and I feel like I'm no closer to an answer than when I started.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday, I have leg weakness all the time.  I regularly wake up in the middle of the night with a rapid heart rate and discomfort throughout my body.  This discomfort/soreness is often present for days at a time.  Sometimes I feel like it moves throughout my body.  I sometimes have discomfort breathing or pain in my diaphragm and stomach while breathing.  I sometimes have left side chest discomfort and nausea, and I sometimes have a little pain in my left leg.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm concerned that my symptoms seem to align with heart failure, though I've had several heart related tests already, and I feel like they would've shown something.  But if that's not it, then what's going on, and how do I fix it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for any insight anyone can provide!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

On mobile so apologise for any formatting issues. Posted in /AskDocs/ but not many threads get a response so thought I'd try my luck here.\n\nI'm female, twenty-one, from the UK, weigh roughly about 98-100lb at 5'3 (I've been verified to be healthy re: wealth and appetite) and I've been struggling with health issues for several years.\n\nEven as a young child I remember not having much stamina but I put it down to being out of shape. I remember small tasks like washing up around the age of eight to eleven making me feel sick, because standing for too long or being near heat makes me feel awful. I get black spots in front of my eye, I feel dizzy, nauseous, and my heart rate gets super fast.\n\nI've never actually passed out but I've been on the verge of it multiple times. I've sat on the bus and randomly felt a flush of heat out of nowhere and the same symptoms appear, and I have to quickly get off and throw up - or, if I'm lucky, I lie down somewhere cold and breathe hard for half an hour or so before I feel better. Any physical activity makes it come about and short of lying in bed constantly, I can't avoid it. I've not been able to get a job as most of them in my area revolve around a lot of physical exertion and I'm not sure it would be professional of me to enter an environment where I could let down the client by randomly experiencing a spell during work.\n\nIn the past five years or so it's gotten worse. My diet's never been awful, I've eaten a lot of greens, meats, beans, 'good' food generally - it's quite varied and I eat double servings whenever possible. I did ballet classes for about fifteen years and various other drama/fitness related classes to keep me more or less active. I also walked quite frequently.\n\nI didn't get my period until the week before I turned eighteen - I'm not sure if this is a red flag at all. I immediately went on BC because my cramps were intense, I also got stabbing pains through my rectum (??) and it amplified my previous symptoms. With BC it died down a little, though not much. It's possible I got my mother's endomitosis but I'm not currently at the stage where I'm going to get a check up to verify this.\n\nSo a few months ago (same age), I finally went to the doctors about my condition because I didn't feel it was normal. My friends told me it was concerned to see me walking along normally when we were out just for me to rush off somewhere and throw up, or to lie down even in the street if desperate. My doctor immediately sent me to the hospital to test for antibodies, gluten intolerance, and anemia, the last of which I always thought I might have and the one which they believed I might have.\n\nI did, and they said the results came back negative. The doctors were convinced (I saw more than one) that I had some sort of anemia and sent me off to do more blood tests. Still nothing. My newest (and last) doctor told me it definitely wasn't anemia and that \"you're probably just feeling bad when you're losing blood on your period if it's heavy\". I was annoyed by this, and told her I only started three years ago and that I've always had this issue present in my life. She looked confused like she thought I was lying and said \"I don't know then. If you take these vitamin C and iron tablets daily for three months, come back if they don't work. If it doesn't work, it's probably something serious\". She sounded flippant and rude, and I felt upset.\n\nI also wasn't aware that I had to pay for them (I forgot you had to, I'm stupid) but unfortunately I have no income and couldn't pay the \u00a340 for them. I went home empty handed and haven't gone back for them yet, but I suppose I should try to save up for them. The only issue is that I've been put onto high iron and vitamin C supplements before as my mother believed I probably had anemia. I'm confused as to why I was given them if I don't have it, and if I'm overreacting and if anything actually is wrong with me. Am I one of those people who just have this kind of issue naturally and makes a big deal out of it? I feel like I'm being a nuisance and I want to know if any health professionals can tell me whether or not I have a problem and what it might be.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

When I got off the transport and had to walk home, it hurt when I walked to the point of limping.\n\nDuring the next weeks almost any walk I made I would start feeling my leg weak/wimpy and eventually pain in the hip. *Details:* if the walk was \"up a hill\" it started hurting faster than if it was down or with an even altitude. Sometimes even walks don't bring pain. We're talking 10 minute walks here.\n\nI went to a doctor who made me take an ultrasound and it didn't reveal anything worth of note, she said. She told me to take ibuprofen every day at dinner for 2 weeks (I think it was two weeks? maybe it was more like a month. I'm sorry, I forgot). And rest: not do any big walks, let the hip rest.

Not so much that I had to stop, but it comes when I step on the right leg.\n\nSensations I feel are: as if there is a bone rasping on another bone (or a tendon perhaps), inside the hip; a burning sensation; the weakness, on the hip and irradiating to the thigh.\n\nI don't feel any correlation to heat (not cool or warm); I feel pain only when walking; when I stop I still feel weakness and tiredness until I recover. It doesn't hurt going up stairs, nor running (I've been running every other week for 30 minutes like 1 minute running 2 minutes walking).\n\n**I went to the doctor again today and she said she couldn't send me to an orthopedist because she hadn't identified anything; that it wasn't a bone issue; and that if it was a trauma caused by the jump I took it would manifest differently.** But I didn't have this before that jump I took...\n\nSo what can this possibly be?

I havent smoked sense I've been sick. I've also had stomach issues for YEARS before I ever started smoking and weed seems to be the only thing that helps the nausea. Please any insight would be wonderful. I feel like I'm wasting away to nothing and I cant lose any more weight!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I was on a 5 day drinking spree and after I was finally weaning of alcohol, My body randomly out of no where for about 10 minutes starts reacting weird. Both my hands begin to curl up inwards uncontrollably and I couldn't do anything to stop it. An example of what it looked like, imagine making a crab claw but facing downwards on both hands. Then my face started reacting next. My cheeks sunk in heavily until they no longer could. My jaw felt like it locked up and couldn't talk unless I screamed. Both my eyes closed until only the iris and pupil only showed. All this was described by my friend and also by how I felt. I'd like too know what happened and what's it called? I know the stupidty of drinking listerine and hand sanitizer caused this but I'd like to know what else should I do and be aware. My guess is that it was a mini stroke but I'm not sure.

{"post_id": "bhw9n7", "created_utc": 1556345713, "title": "Seizures and confusion", "author": "sherrasama", "self_text": "I've seen what feels like a hundred doctors, and I do have some answers, but after last week I have even more questions and I'm hoping maybe someone can help me shed some light. \n\nHere's the rundown:\n\nStarting about 10 years ago, I started getting pretty massive (what I thought were) panic attacks. I have always described these attacks as like my brain getting a BSOD. They've only even increased in intensity, frequency, and consequence. Starting about 2 years ago I started having involuntary loss of bladder control during an episode.\n\nI was diagnosed with Hashimoto's and a fairly large tumor on my thyroid, so after a period of treating the Hashimoto's the decision was made to just remove my entire thyroid. After my thyroid dose was leveled out after the removal, my panic attacks did subside. However other symptoms started cropping up. Some of these may or may not be related to the main issues at hand but I shall list them anyway. \n\nConfirmed for a while now that I have PCOS and endometriosis. I went to the ER with a rather several burst ovarian cyst about 2 months ago. I have an IUD in place. I'm taking Metformin to help control the cysts. After a while of being under control my panic attacks and bladder loss returned in double force. I had a consult with a new endo specialist who put me through a glucose stim test and confirmed a severe human growth hormone deficiency. I've been awaiting approval with my insurance for HGH replacement shots that just this week were finally OKd. I still haven't received them yet but am in the works to start. I am also currently seeing a gastro specialist who is in the process of testing me for Celiac and H. Pylori due to stomach trouble, I do not have those results yet. I was seeing an ENT and was due this week to have a nasal surgery to try to open up my airway somewhat due to severe sleep apnea. That surgery was cancelled due to the events I'm about to describe.\n\nFor a while now, since the bladder issues started up with the attacks, I've been on a CPAP machine to try to help my apnea but with limited effect because I keep having these panic attack/freakouts/parasomnias whatever you want to call them, but I have no actual memory or conscious recollection of removing my CPAP, dragging it around by the hose, urinating on myself, banging walls, talking to myself. My husband has recorded some video of these events and shown them to the neurologist we just went to go consult with. \n\nYou see, last Thursday night I had what I consider to be a seizure. The neuro doc isn't convinced but I don't know what else you'd describe what happened. I woke up to my husband crying and screaming over me and he tells me that for about 4 minutes I was spasming, chewing my tongue, slammed my head into the side table, was unresponsive and unable to be awoken. I was contorted on the floor and even now I'm covered in bruises and have horrible nerve pain in my back and shoulder where I had my weight on it. \n\nI went to the ER that morning, they took a bunch of a blood but they declined to do a CT as I'd just recently had one as well as an MRI w/ contrast to check for possible tumors in my pituitary (they didn't find any). There's not much of note, parts of my CBC were high, glucose was a little high. I emailed one of my docs to see if they could run thyroid panels on some of the spare blood they had but I don't have any results on that yet.\n\nThe thing is, since the main event last week I've had dozens and dozens of smaller \"panic attack\" type events that I now think might actually be petit mal seizures. I've been in a mental fog since last week, feeling very spacey, confused, and slow. Punctuated by these freak outs in which I end up urinating on myself. The neuro doc said that I seem fine and cognizant but compared to my normal self, I most definitely am not. I know a lot of what I'm writing here is rambly and disconnected but that's part of why I'm having so much trouble advocating for myself. Why hasn't my normal mental function returned? What on earth out of my many different diagnoses is responsible for this seizure-like behavior? How do I work toward normalcy? \n\nIn addition to the mental stuff, since last week, my hands and feet have been insanely cold and my feet feel like there's bugs crawling all over them. I keep feeling nerve twinges in my joints and I've no desire to eat. My skin, hair, and nails are all doing terrible. I'm trying to remember everything but undoubtedly I've missed some things, I will edit as needed...If you can think of anything I should be doing, please help...", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I think mystery illness killing me RIP", "author": "lazy-lily-fren", "self_text": "Okay here are the symptoms:\n\n1. Getting sick all. the. time. Any kind--flu, cold, bronchitis maybe, anything really.\n   1. Throwing up\n   2. passing out (though this is rare). I do FEEL like passing out often, though\n   3. sore throat, stuffy nose\n   4. eye infection, or VERY dry eyes, not sure (and very dry mouth, come to think of it)\n   5. I had a cough that lasted for about a year and got worse when I exercised and now it's gone. Mostly.\n   6. I actually used to be sick EVERY DAY. Then I took loads of antibiotics and steroids and now it's about every other week, but it lasts way more than a week, so I'm still basically always sick. And I think it's increasing in frequency again, aka it's coming back.\n   7. ear pain\n   8. Nausea\n   9. Idk I got VERY sick about five years ago--in bed for a week at least, maybe two I forget. Then I was ok. Now I've been experiencing these to a noticeable degree for about two years.\n2. Bone pain: apparently my Vitamin D was low. So is my mother's. Seems genetic? Now my bones feel fine.\n3. Low vitamin B12. This was a doctor's attempt to help me. I now take supplements. Whatever.\n4. \\*Extreme\\* fatigue. Yes, I have depression, anxiety, and OCD. Or so it seems. There's no real consensus.\n5. But that brings up a good point: I seem to have developed very severe anxiety/depression/OCD.\n6. I also have developed ADHD/what's wrong with my brain! Is it brain fog? Is it a mental concern? DID I have it as a child? You have to have ADHD as a child for it to exist in adulthood. But it's also under diagnosed in women, especially the inattentive kind.\n   1. Signs in childhood: I forgot to button my painting coat more than once when told\n   2. I struggled not to wet myself in preschool\n   3. I failed the standardized tests in the computer labs in elementary school but got the highest scores in the school when I had to retake them in the principal's office\n   4. I'm sure there are more of these, but they don't seem overly related to school. Some doctors wonder if my OCD cancelled out areas of the ADHD, hiding it from diagnoses, especially because my sister had ADHD and my parents weren't and still struggle to be very mental-health conscious\n7. SO much sweating. I sweat when I walk. When I exercise it looks like I took a shower after just warming up. And my face turns beat red. Which isn't super uncommon, but lately it just looks very sickly. So embarrassing/gross!\n8. The past 6 weeks: CRAZY ITCHY RASH HELP! I've used prescription creams, and I took medicine a doctor prescribed, maybe an antibiotic. It aways goes away, and I'm like phew! THEN IT COMES BACK! I am SO itchy. It seems to go then come back. I try not to itch but I can only last so long if it's been like six weeks!! It's everywhere except for my feet, stomach, and lower back. It was primarily my arms to start, then a few spots on my legs, now mostly my face, neck, and arms and it won't go away! They're like hives. Small red bumps. When itched, they become inflamed so they look like slightly larger round bumps. Like teensy elevated puddles. There used to be white spots on the surface that would scratch off. Not anymore though. I look like a red and white cheetah at night, especially. It's not allergies to a new location--I've been here for five years now. Maybe it's totally unrelated and I have poison oak????\n9. Speaking of which, night sweats? Is it because I get SO cold that now I have too many blankets? This just didn't use to be a problem for me. I fluctuate between hot and cold\n10. So yeah, the past few years I've been so cold I had to buy a space heater, insulate the window, buy another blanket, and at school I literally lie under the air-blowing hand dryers because I can't stay warm. Then I go exercise and it's like I showered. Someone literally thought I showered once because my hair was sopping.\n11. Redness on my face. Nonstop. I have used rosacea cream for years now. And one of them actually helped for a while. Not anymore. It's driving me insane. If I'm going to be crazy sick, can I just have monotone skin color? My face is a different color from the rest of my body, and it always has been. Or at least since teenage years.\n12. Starting about six months ago, my hearing would just nearly cut out spontaneously. I'd be in class, and then suddenly everything is ten times quieter. I wonder what's wrong, and then it comes back. Haven't had this in a bit.\n13. All my life I've had periodic trouble breathing deeply because I have a sharp pain near my heart. It's rare, but it can last an hour, a day, a week, or sometimes off and on through a month. I've had my heart tested: it's very fast, but there's nothing wrong with it. Another doctor suggested it was rib inflammation, apparently common in young women. I took ibuprofen.\n14. SEVERE pain in left side of abdomen last semester. Lasted for a couple of months I think? Felt like an organ. Was told that inflammation of the lungs/ribs can cause a centralized pain like that. Took ibuprofen.\n15. Most recently: recurring headaches. Why is this weird? I'm almost 23 and have had, like, 2 or 3 headaches in my entire life. Now they're every day. Like, sharp pains in my neck and head, super new.\n16. I have had pain in my left shoulder/neck for as long as I can remember. I went through physical therapy to strengthen it. They thought it was from holding my flute so much.  I continue to have extreme tightness on that side, and my vertebrae stick together over there every couple of hours. Unless it's just popping. A physical trainer told me it felt like facets. But can facets really come back THAT fast? A couple of hours? I just pull it apart when it feels stuck, but I can't pull apart the right side because it hurts the left. Is it from being an athlete? I am \\*very very\\* flexible, so maybe it's a lack of strength? I also once woke up one morning two years ago feeling dizzy, which turned into an inability to move  my left side at all, which turned into an inability to move much at all at all. I saw an athletic trainer, the student trainer thought it was facets, tried separating it, it got inflamed, could hardly walk. Was better in a few days.\n17. VERY. BAD. INSOMNIA. OR. SLEEP. PROCRASTINATION. I actually wonder if sleeping poorly for years and years and years could just NOW be wrecking my body. Like, is it all a sleep problem? I have literally tried \\~everything\\~ : sleep meds, sleep hygiene, late classes, reading dull books, tea, baths, yoga, stretching, journaling, therapy. Help.\n18. I'm so tired it's hard to eat. SO a therapist mentioned today I may have an eating disorder. She thinks these symptoms sound like an eating disorder--my body is eating itself (specifically, my heart). However, the question remains: am I not eating enough because I'm sick and therefore too tired to make/get food? Because that IS accurate. OR did I progressively start eating less and less without really being consciously aware (because let's face it, I can't take care of myself sometimes--I hate bed and I hate cooking) and now I'm so tired from progressively eating less that I eat even less? I mean, I GET hungry, and I WILL eat. I feel like puking if I don't eat. I definitely eat. But she's worried it's not just disordered, its an eating disorder. I admit I use eating sometimes to cope with depression and anxiety, and I eat at the weirdest times of day ever. She's explained you don't have to have an issue with weight (though I have SOME but not that much at all!) or dieting to get an eating disorder, and you're not well-equipped to gauge if you have one because your full/hunger cues are messed up. Apparently most people she's seen with eating disorders had no clue they had one. I know I'm not a great eater, but I didn't realize this.\n19. I used to have IBS, and I still get pretty bloated at times. It's better managed now for some reason. It was probably stress-induced, and it still can be, but not as bad. Is my body just expressing stress differently now?\n20. depersonalization/dissociation/Borderline personality disorder: I kind of think these came from my ex boyfriend, who became a bit traumatizing, but WHO KNOWS?!\n21. Lifelong weak tooth enamel. I admit I'm not the best brusher to grace the earth, and since I've improved, I've had fewer cavities. But I still have to go to crazy more lengths than most people and I still get cavities. Like I really do floss every day now.\n22. Hurts to walk. But also I'm an athlete so who knows if my amount of pain is normal or above average.\n23. Apparently it's normal to be able to pee in a cup on demand? I cannot. I definitely cannot. Never can.\n24. I feel like I have bugs crawling on me sometimes. That said, my house used to be covered in fleas, and they LOVEDDDD me (I'm a huge hit with the  bugs) and so I would get the same sensation out of fear. There have been ants in my room lately so maybe I'm just a little scared they're crawling in my hair/on my skin/biting me. And I kind of suspect itching my head/body so much from the rash might  leave a sensation that something is there afterword.\n25. Idk if I've done this my whole life, but I'm aware lately that when I'm going to bed, I just sit there and shake my leg. I'll just move it up and down nonstop without really noticing. Except now I've noticed. I kind of do this no matter what actually. I just seem much more ADHD than I used to.\n26. worsening vision. But I know accutane CAN temporarily cause this. See below.\n27. Abnormal periods. Bleeding when I shouldn't be, lots of bleeding when I should. Like more than I used to have. This could be a birth control thing I guess. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTESTS TAKEN\n\nLyme disease: I know this notoriously hides from tests though\n\nSeveral Autoimmune diseases: I know many of those are very hard to diagnose as well.........\n\nMono\n\nOther blood tests I'm sure? Mostly ANA I think, though. And just general levels of stuff\n\nAnd then I'm going to be screened for an eating disorder this summer + I'll see an allergist/immunologist + hopefully I can get into the rheumatologist. An eye doctor is working on that for me. A general practitioner told me a rheumatologist would laugh me out of their office because I display no signs of an autoimmune disease.................................................\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDRUGS I'M ON:\n\nYES, I'm on accutane, and I have been for 9 months. The first dermatologist screwed up and took me off early (4 months, and obvious acne remaining), so I have to do 6 months the second time around. I have had an accutane rash before, and it did not look like this at all--not bumpy, and hives-like. More like heat rash, or a severe sunburn. But I don't know! I called the derm and asked--they told me this does not sound like it's related to accutane.\n\nAlso, it hasn't changed my mood as far as I know. I have been super cognizant of mood changes because my last anxiety medication was too high, I was crazy, and I didn't even know until someone pointed out that my anxiety meds might be too high.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdderall small dose\n\nvitamin B12 and Vitamin D\n\nbirth control for the accutane\n\nan OCD/anxiety/depression medicine called Zoloft\n\nOmega 3 supplements. Can you really be allergic to that? Also I'm pretty sure the rash started before the omega 3.\n\nA cream for rosacea, and then a couple more for the rash + hydrocortisone cream (I kind of gave up on those though)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoctor Theories:\n\nIt's all psychosomatic: anxiety, depression\n\nIt's an autoimmune disease or Lyme or relative of Lyme that no one has yet found\n\nIt's an allergy I can't figure out\n\nIt's an eating disorder: but I've had some of the symptoms of the eating disorder since forever, like the insomnia/messed up circadian rhythm and the high levels of anxiety, OCD, and perfectionism. That's why I tend to believe my sickness has caused the eating disorder and WORSE sickness, and not the other way around.\n\nIt's my poor sleep habits (though I increased sleep out of desperation for doctors to believe me last semestre, and it didn't have much impact at all. So either a semestre of better sleep (How on EARTH did I do that I can NOT sleep now) isn't good enough to fix/even alleviate years of poor sleeping, or it's not my sleep", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Just a clarifying point, I worked in a warehouse at my job and became an intern at the corporate side of that same company. I knew that my insurance changed but for some reason was under the impression that I still had it. \n\nI'm a 26 year old male and live an active lifestyle. I run an hour 4-5 times a week.\n\nIn January of this year, I switched from a night shift warehouse job to an accounting internship. With this transition, I realize that I had insomnia which may or may not be a factor. I developed joint pain only in my fingertips when I applied pressure to them. For example, when I use my phone or type on a computer I get delayed pain in my fingertips. I would describe the pain as more of my joints being sore not a sharp immediate pain.\n\n I did the ketogenic diet for 6 months last year and stop doing it in August. I know it's pretty stereotypical to have joint pain after coming off that diet because I cheated like twice a month and experienced it firsthand. Since contracting this condition I have been doing a low inflammation diet.(no sugar, dairy, and no gluten). With my current diet I can reduce the the pain significantly and try to do workarounds at work to reduce me using my fingertips.\n\nI have been to an arthritis specialist and they said that I had no no sign of arthritis. This included blood markers and an x-ray to confirm. They also test my vitamin d levels which four are on the lower end of the range (39) but still at an acceptable level.\n\nI have also been to a family doctor and they have no idea what's going on.\n\nCurrently I'm taking no prescription drugs but I am taking a multivitamin two times a day, 4000 IU's a vitamin d a day, 500mg of magnesium glycinate, glucosamine chondroitin two times a day, ibuprofen 200mg two times a day, 3 mg of melatonin, and I take CBD oil before I go to sleep.\n\nAt this point I'm stuck in a situation where it's difficult for me to work because of my condition, I can't get medical help because I don't have health insurance and I am also in debt because I was unaware of the insurance change. I've been doing everything in my power with diet and exercise to try to aid the situation, but something is clearly wrong. I know this is a long shot but at this point I'm pretty desperate after 4 months. I've been having my girlfriend type all my school stuff and some work stuff in her spare time.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.\nI apologize for writing a novel :)", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I saw many doctors here in Canada, including infectious diseases and a gastroenterologist, but because my stool tests were negative (they only tested for the most common bacteria and missed the infection I had) I didn't receive any help. I finally ordered a comprehensive qPCR stool test from a US lab, and I test positive for Enterohemorrhagic E. Coli. I also show ESBL antibiotic resistance genes. Test results in hand, I went back to the hospital, where I was told (even after attending doc consulted with Infectious Diseases) that the bacterial infection I have is just a coincidence, that my symptoms are just irritable bowel syndrome, and to go home and eat yogurt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTest Results:[ https://www.dropbox.com/s/jlpgwmoriksjuf6/GI%20MAP%20Stool%20Test.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jlpgwmoriksjuf6/GI%20MAP%20Stool%20Test.pdf?dl=0)\n\nSymptoms &amp; History:[ https://www.dropbox.com/s/wbpdbw5vgdxvpm2/History.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wbpdbw5vgdxvpm2/History.pdf?dl=0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **PRESSING QUESTION:** I have an upper GI scope with biopsies scheduled for May 1. **Is it a risk to get biopsies given I have a K. Pneumoniae infection?** If the gastrointestinal wall is thinned from biospy, could it increase the chance of them escaping my GI tract (I see they can cause serious pneumonia or autoimmune diseases if that happens). And I've read perforation is a risk.\n2. **Can you recommend a doctor/clinic/hospital who has the requisite knowledge to deal with my case?** I am willing to travel outside Canada. It seems seeing any Infectious Diseases specialist is not enough, because here in Canada, before I got my test results on my own, an ID specialist claimed it was not possible for me to have a bacterial infection given my symptoms and the fact it lasted longer than 2 weeks, another one had never heard of PCR testing and refused to help me order anything but the standard stool culture and asked me to give it 18-24 months for it to get better on its own, and the ID at the hospital discharged me with no further options or referrals, but I'm still in constant pain and not improving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSee dropbox links above for my test results and symptom history.\n\nThank you", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

The urgency is, suffice to say, rather debilitating. I'm becoming much more desperate to find _something_ as this mystery illness is pretty much ruining my education and career prospects plus my social life. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#### About me:\n\n**Age:** 24\n\n**Sex:** Male\n\n**Height:** 5'10\n\n**Weight:** Unknown, but overweight\n\n**Race:** Caucasian \n\n**Location (geographical and on body):** UK; Urethra/urinary tract?\n\n**Existing medical issues:** Within the last year I have developed GERD-like symptoms and have been diagnosed with Hashimoto's \n\n**Current medication:** Levothyroxine (50mg), Esomeprazole (40mg), and Ranitidine (300mg)\n\n**Smoking/drugs:** I neither smoke nor do any drugs\n\n**Drinking:** I very rarely drink - if I do it's more commonly at social events (last time I drank is new year's eve)\n\n**Exercise:** While somewhat housebound I do ensure that I maintain a daily schedule of walking, however I do not do any intense exercise due to it being a trigger as noted below\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n#### About the 'urgency'/symptoms:\n- The urge itself typically comes on quite suddenly - there's very little build up if any\n- The urge is seemingly located in the urethra, nearer the glans (however sometimes it can be difficult to pinpoint)\n- I do not leak when I get the urge, and I can hold said urge as long as I like\n- More often than not, I don't actually need to pee when I get the urge. If I go to the toilet sometimes all I'll produce is somewhere less than 100ml, however peeing will alleviate the urge \n- As much as the urgency does lead to frequency, I don't experience an increased thirst. I usually drink about 2-2.5L of water a day (aside from a cup of tea at lunch I basically only drink water)\n- As per my bladder diaries, I can still fill my bladder to around 700ml\n- I can sleep through the night without any issues\n- Weirdly, ever since this problem started, my morning pees have much less volume than they used to. Sometimes I may only pee out 200-300ml\n- I don't experience any pain while peeing\n- I do not bleed while peeing\n- I do experience discharge of a white jelly-like substance from my penis but only during a bowel movement\n- My urine is usually lightish-yellow or clear and doesn't emit an awful odour, but can be quite 'bubbly'\n- Around the time this all started I did go through various stressful events within about a week, however as noted below this issue does not appear to be a reaction to stress - if anything this may have kicked off a bizarre chain reaction\n- **Triggers:**\n\n- So far, the only triggers I've found are travelling in a vehicle and doing any sort of physical activity for at least 5-10 minutes. The intensity of the urge will lower if I rest\n- Vehicles seem to have varying times in which the urge will appear. For example, in my friend's car the urge usually appears within 5 minutes, whereas in my aunt's car the urge may not appear until travelling for 45 minutes up to an hour\n- Also worth noting that, while in my friend's car, the urge settled down after he parked halfway through the journey. After setting off again the urge appeared once more in around 5 minutes\n- There aren't any foods or drinks that increase or decrease the likelihood of me feeling an urge - however, alcohol can exacerbate the feeling to a point where it may feel as if I'm peeing myself although I'm completely dry. Additionally, while drunk the urge will not disappear even if I do pee until I've sobered up a tiny amount. Drinking a lot of water in a short period of time has the same effects (however I have only experienced this once)\n- Anxiety or stress do not appear to be triggers (unless of course it's completely subconscious), and thinking about the urge will not cause it to appear\n- Whilst the urge is typically at its worst when set off by a trigger, it can appear at idle times even when my bladder is only holding 150ml\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n####Tests/Procedures:\n- STI and urine tests come back clear\n- Kidney and liver function seem fine\n- I have been tested for diabetes (plus diabetes insipidus) - all was clear\n- Cystogram didn't show any major issues with my urethra or bladder, there was a \"minor obstruction\" which appears to be of no concern\n- Prostate is fine. Blood tests regarding the prostate suggest the same\n- Urodynamics showed that my bladder fills and empties normally. Additionally, I didn't get the urge until my bladder was filled up to ~600ml\n- I have tried CBT which did not confirm that there are any psychological issues here\n- I have tried TENS machine therapy (for a month), however unfortunately the urge appeared immediately each time I used the machine and did not deter it\n- Pelvic floor training has not made a difference\n- **Medications:** \n\n- Amitriptyline, duloxetine, vesicare, oxybutynin, mirabegron, trospium, tolterodine, and sertraline. These medications either had no effect or made it harder to begin peeing and did not mitigate the urge", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

History of GERD, have taken omeprazole for 7 years but recently quit coffee, upped water intake, and have been able to stop use of the med and seen significant improvement in acid (like a lot). For whatever that's worth. On to the story...\n\nAbout 3.5 years ago I had a pretty bad cold. I was on a flight and upon descent noticed my ears clogged up as you'd expect in that situation. After landing I noticed my right ear was fine but my left ear still felt a bit full. I figured it would go away later that day or at most, by morning. It did not. It's hard to explain the feeling \u2014\u00a0'glue ear' is apropos in the way it describes how I feel, but many tests have shown there is no fluid in my inner ear. My hearing has not been affected, nothing sounds muffled, it's just this consistent 'full' feeling that has persisted for years and really affects my everyday life.\n\nHere's what I've been through to address this. All the basic at-home things you can thing to try: ear drops, nasal sprays, anti-inflammatories, quitting coffee, more water, better sleep, generally improving my health has not seemed to have any effect. Valsava maneuver doesnt help but I do it all the time just hoping maybe it'll do something. Yawning, swallowing, massaging neck/cheek near ear but never really actually does anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoctors visits:\n\n\u2022ENT #1: Performed thorough physical exam, put a long 'microscope' kind of thing in my nose to rule out any sort of tumor or growth, hearing tests. Sent me on my way with no answers.  \n\u2022ENT #2: Same as above, said perhaps its neurological, sent me on my way.  \n\u2022ENT #3/4/5 (3 different ENTs at one practice): Multiple hearing tests, all normal.

No vestibular aqueduct enlargement. Facial nerve canal unremarkable. Mild inferior maxillary sinus mucosal thickening bilaterally w/ small retention cyst on the left. Paranasal sinuses clear. Brain parenchyma within normal limits. // Areas of deossification of the bilateral tegmen mastoideum and tegmen tympani with suggestion of possible dehiscence.

Cisternal segments of trigeminal nerves unremarkable.  Normal MRI temporal bones.*\n\n\u2014Tympanostomy Tube Insertion: I opted to get a tube placed in my left ear in hopes it would relieve my issue to no avail. Tube is still in there, has been for 6 months. Going to get it taken out soon as it just makes going in water a pain.\n\n\u2014Referred to a dentist who specializes in jaw issues.

(Legitimate Inquiry)", "author": "hereisalreadyhome", "self_text": "I'm a 32-year-old female with no diagnosed  medical or mental health conditions. For the past three years or so, I have been having this sense of deja Vu upon looking at office supplies stacked in cabinets or looking down into a box of copy paper. I know, ridiculous. \n\nThese episodes began when I moved back to the US in 2016. At first, the deja Vu was more generalized. I'd find myself attempting to find the memory associated with the deja Vu experience. If I followed that rabbit hole too closely, I'd pass out and have a vague sensation of having been writhing on the floor once I recovered. Seizures, maybe? Nobody ever witnessed it directly, but they occured twice in the shower and family members heard me fall. On waking up from the worst one, I didn't know who I was or where I was for a few minutes- probably the most terrifying moment in my life. \n\nIt's been years since I have had a seizure- and I've come to believe that those episodes were likely a stress response to the move back to the US and starting my first year as a high school teacher (a job I fucking love, btw). These days, the deja Vu and associated sense of dread are pretty well contained to two very specific triggers- looking down into a file box filled with paper (a common sight in my line of work) or looking into those very generic school/hospital cabinets filled with office supplies. I've managed to train myself to pull out of that dread and move away from the trigger pretty quickly, but it still gets my heart pumping and the dread won't completely dissipate for a few minutes. \n\nI went to the ER after the memory-loss incident, and they found nothing in my MRI. I then went to my doctor and have had nothing come back odd except a slightly elevated ANA-titer. \n\nI have come to suspect that I have episodes of anxiety that are a bit sneaky- and have been training myself into better cognitive habits, but this one has me stumped.\n\n\nAnyone ever heard of anything like this?

Please help.", "author": "hb8847", "self_text": "I know this is probably the wrong place to be posting this but frankly I'm at the stage where I don't know where else to turn. Any help anyone can provide would be massively appreciated. Thanks in advance.\n\n**TLDR** - worsening health issues, both cognitive &amp; physical, going back over a decade. Problems with B12, histamine intolerance, and gut dysbiosis (particularly candida) have been identified. Diet alterations helped in the past but I'm at a point where practically all foods are problematic in some regard. Looking for any advice as to what might be going on, even anything just pointing me in a particular direction would be great. More detailed summary below. **/TLDR**\n\nExtended version - this began about 10 years ago with cognitive &amp; \"depression\" symptoms that got steadily worse over time. Eventually it became so bad I had to quit work &amp; move back home with my parents about 4 years ago. Things were incredibly bleak - it basically felt like my brain was ceasing to function. Coordination, cognition, speech, mood - everything that involved my brain was severely inhibited and I was slowly becoming a zombie. It was utter, unimaginable torture, and entirely unlivable for any signficant stretch of time.\n\nAround then I was trying different things, anything that might help, always in vain. New drugs, antidepressants, anything, I'd seen every psychiatrist under the sun and I'd tried the lot. After a few years of this I then randomly read something about gluten being linked with depression, and on a whim I overhauled my diet, getting rid of gluten but also dairy, sugar, and anything processed. Pretty much all I was eating from then on was rice, meat, veg, fruit, and immediately I noticed a small but marked improvement for the first time in years.\n\nOver the next year or so all the aforementioned symptoms - cognition, coordination - gradually began to improve, purely from this dietary shift. I was slowly becoming a human again and it was an incredibly relief.\n\nThen after about 10 months things suddenly got worse again in what I'm now pretty sure was a histamine reaction. Depression &amp; anxiety again, but now lots of physical symptoms too - a full body chronic fatigue, like being hit with a massive fever, plus diarrhea and some problems with my vision. This persisted for about a year until I was almost entirely bedbound from the fatigue. Again things looked pretty bleak.\n\nThis forced me to reevaluate. My diet was healthy; there was something else going on. I reached out to more doctors and following a comprehensive stool test one of them diagnosed me with gut dysbiosis and prescribed a course of antibiotics (no effect) and also antifungals (big effect).\n\nMy sensitivity to the antifungals was absolute. I could barely take any without experiencing an intense die-off reaction and so assumed my gut must have been ravaged with fungus (stool samples show little in the way of how much of something there is, just that it's there. I had candida and rhamnosus strains present fyi).\n\nSo, over the course of a year I gradually increased the dose of antifungals and slowly started to improve again. I also removed further foods from my diet which seemed to be problematic, like rice (I wasn't aware of the histamine diagnosis at the time). This left me on a very restricted diet of chicken and green vegetables. Obviously not ideal but it seemed to be the only thing that prevented me from getting any worse and I made sure to supplement it with a multivitamin.\n\nSo like I said, over this time I began to improve. So much so that I was able to go for walks again, and read. I decided to try introducing some healthy fats to broaden my diet, namely coconut and avocado. This went very badly. I picked up many of the old symptoms from a year previous when I initially came down with all the histamine problems (again, at the time I wasn't aware of histamine intolerance being a thing) and I wasn't sure why these were creating issues as they were low carb and shouldn't be feeding the candida or any other gut nasties.\n\nOn top of this I then began to develop other problems with my remaining 'safe' foods. This time not a \"histamine\" reaction but more immediate, more intense. Like severe brain fog with intense stomach pain and palpitations, particularly from eating meat. It would get so bad I've visited the emergency dept a couple of times on account of this, no diagnosis though.\n\nThis was last summer and was a pretty worrying time as I was finding I was having problems when I tried putting anything - food or medicine - in my stomach.  And the symtoms were bad enough that I'd often go 2 or 3 days without food to calm things down, which generally worked. But unfortunately you can't fast forever.\n\nThis was when I found the doctor who put me onto the histamine diagnosis, using blood serum DAO as an indicator. So, I went on a zero histamine diet (mainly just veg and small amounts of fresh meat), which stemmed some of the histamine reactions (diarrhea, fever, anxiety) but did nothing for the brain fog reactions which had become my bigger concern.\n\nHe referred me to a nutritionist who thought the issue could be methylation related. He put me on a course of Methyl-B12, methylfolate, and TMG and immediately my brain fog began to subside. Over time I was able to add more foods back in and he suggested I get my genes tested for B12 issues which I duly did at 23andme.\n\nSince then I've been taking the methylation supplements and it's reduced my brain fog and I feel significantly more able to function. However my problems with histamine are still there, still very bad, and if anything seem to have gotten worse since I've added the Methyl supplements, to such an extent that any foods even with the most minute quantity of histamine will likely set me off.\n\nOn top of that foods high in folate (so pretty much all veg) causes me to overmethylate (anxiety, insomnia), again not leaving me with much I'm able to consume. I'm also aware that methyl supplements can worsen histamine intolerance, but I need the B12 so I'm not sure what choice I have.\n\nIf I were to summarise what I think is going on, it would be as follows;\n\n1. At the core of all my issues is a severe B12 deficiency, probably caused in part by genetic variants such as MTHFR. \n\n2. This contributed to my initial cognitive decline all those years ago, and also compromised my immune system allowing gut parasites and yeast to proliferate in my gut unchallenged.\n\n3. This led to a weakened gut mucosal lining and likely intestinal permeability, which allowed damaging molecules like gliadin to enter my bloodstream and cross my blood-brain barrier. Ultimately this can cause severe cognitive damage which could explain why I had such an improvement by giving up gluten and dairy. \n\n4. Treatment with antifungals reduced (but didn't entirely remove) the amount of fungus lining my gut, improving symptoms both directly and also indirectly through enabling my gut lining to heal. \n\nI know I still have problems here because (a) I still experience die off reactions to taking too many antifungals &amp; (b) my gut lining still seems damaged - I cannot eat any grains like rice without nasty symptoms, both cognitive and physical.\n\n5. This is where things get a bit confused. In spite of the intestinal improvement (caused by diet changes and treatment with antifungals) my histamine intolerance didn't get any better, and in fact seemed to even get worse. \n\nTo me this doesn't make any sense. My understanding here of the mechanisms involving the microbiome and histamine is as follows, please correct me if I'm wrong:\n\n- (a) candida damages gut lining which prevents production of DAO \n- (b) existence of pathogens like candida will trigger immune system and mast cell activation further increasing the histamine load \n- (c) probable existence of further histamine-producing bacteria in my gut can add to the problem. \n- (d) too much histamine in the gut decreases zonulin, causing yet more gut permeability and worsening all the above issues\n\nSo how did partially curing my gut candida/fungal problem worsen and not improve my histamine intolerance? The only thing that makes sense to me here is that I have other histamine-producing gut microbes/parasites that have proliferated in the absence of the fungus. Issue here is I've already done a pretty hefty course of antibiotics which didn't resolve it, so not sure what more I can do.\n\nThe other possibility is that my attempt to rectify my methylation problems I've inadvertently worsened the histamine intolerance. At the moment I'm trying to reduce my methylfolate content to see if that has any effect, and reducing my consumption of leafy greens and just doing meat for a while.\n\nI know this is long and extensive and I appreciate if you have read this far. I will be seeing my doctor again in a few weeks - I imagine he will want me to get another stool test and go from there. But in the meantime if anyone here has any advice, if anything I've said rings a bell or triggers something, please let me know. Particularly in regards to B12 and histamine - resolving the gut stuff will probably be more of a long haul thing, but my priority for the moment has to be getting my histamine levels down to a level that's manageable and will allow the B12 to do its work.\n\nAlternatively if you have suggestions on a more appropriate forum/subreddit to ask this on please let me know.\n\nThanks again", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}
