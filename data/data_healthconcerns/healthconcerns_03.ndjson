No preexisting conditions. No medication. I've had the symptoms since early childhood 15 yrs(I may have been too young to notice before then). \n\n\nAround the age of 15 I noticed that every other week my nose would feel VERY SLIGHTLY restricted from air, as if the passageway was blocked by something. This didn't affect me at all due to how negligible the amount of reduce breathing was however what WAS weird when that after maybe 3-4 days of noticing the blockage i could close my throat and do the maneuver where you attempts to drain your sinuses. If I pulled incredibly hard, after maybe 5 or 6 minutes i would dislodge something that IMMEDIATELY fell into my throat. It tasted absolutely horrid and I would gag. I don't know how long this went on until i finally managed to cough one up but [here is what it looks like at my current age.] (https://imgur.com/a/octUKA8) \n\nUpon clearing it from my nose my breathing is instantly easier and I feel I can take deeper breaths (again, this is very very slightly increasing and in no way inhibits me) however there is then a pain in my nose as if there is an open wound that the skin is now rubbing up against. This pain goes away after a few hours. Currently it takes around 2-3 days after clearing it for me to notice the blockage again. Then another 2-3 days after noticing to be able to successfully clear it. If i DON'T clear it myself, after around 2 weeks I will suddenly feel it slide down my throat with no warning whatsoever. I feel the time is coming to see a doctor but maybe someone here knows what this is.\n\n\nI've included photos. I don't even know what to search for this but i've tried everything and the only thing that comes up in google is \"Nasal Polyps\" which I can see making sense due to the shape of the mucus. Its a half circle with the left half a dark brown and semi-hard but still flexible and squishy. The right half is bright white and basically just mucus. There is a very thin \"shell\" that makes up the shape. The inside is completely dry while the outside is slimy and mucus covered. \n\nThrowaway because no-one must ever know about this.

I weigh 140 pounds and am decently healthy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been struggling with very easily pulled muscles for years now.

I also get random \"twinges\" all over my body if I make even remotely quick movements. Here are a few examples:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Pulled triceps muscle. Pain appeared when sitting in an office chair. I tried to workout with it, but the pain got worse and it was apparent that real damage was being done. It's been 2 weeks since this happened and it is marginally better. What is even more weird is that two days after I started resting things (not working out or using the muscle at all) my other arm started exhibiting similar pain and now I'm dealing with this on both sides of my body... Like if I do a push-up right now, I'm bound to reset my problems and be back at square one.\n2. I have a footrest under my computer chair. I was rocking it back and forth and my calf caught a twinge.  It has now been sore for a few days. This is nowhere near the level of issue I'm having with my triceps, but I wasn't overusing or stretching or even working my calf hard at all.\n3. \"Sprained ankle pain\" came up a few months ago. I started noticing pain in my right ankle that appeared with no sudden onset or anything. It didn't happen during a period of hard use or anything. I just randomly had a \"sprained ankle\" that took months to get better. \n4. Achilles tendon. I pulled a door open and propped it open with my foot to let others through. A lightweight door... I felt a twinge in my Achilles tendon that took about two weeks to feel better.\n5. Standing in the cafeteria at work, I felt a twinge while I wasn't moving at all in my left quad. My legs were still usable, but it took 2 weeks for my quad to feel better.\n\nAside from these more prominent issues, tasks like taking my shirt off, bending over to pick something up, or anything else mundane could mean a quick twinge in some random muscle in my body.  Most of which come and go within less than a second or a dull ache after the very rapid twinge that goes away within 5 minutes. My muscles also take way longer to recuperate after a moderately difficult workout. It can take a week for soreness to go away from a mundane workout.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can also exhibit overuse symptoms very quickly when working out. So an hour long workout that someone straight off the couch for 5 years could do would result in some kind of injury to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am being testing for gastrointestinal issues because I also have trouble gaining weight so malabsorption might play a role, but I'm not so sure... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther notes...\n\nI have HSV-1 genitally, but asymptomatic for a while now (yeah, weird, I know...)\n\nI have a positive ANA blood test (but no other signs of Lupus)\n\nI have some fatigue, but nothing crazy.\n\nI get some brain fog and headaches fairly often, but I'm pretty sure it is from looking at screens for too long.\n\nMy diet is pretty healthy and I take supplements (that I introduced gradually and individually) such as whey protein, amino acids, multivitamin.\n\nI have tried the \"its all in my head\" approach and cannot push through injuries as they just get worse\n\nI have tried the \"I'm working too hard, so I'll back off\" but injuries still happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry that this is probably written terribly. I just wrote symptoms as I thought through. I'm still pretty healthy. I could go run a sub 6 minute mile, but I just can't lift weights or do daily tasks without a significant risk of some random injury. The injury might appear from an obvious cause or it might show its face when I'm just sitting there. It's quite frustrating. It's like I can't recover muscle or make new muscle. Or maybe it's connective tissue or something... I'm at a loss.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I have a rabbit-hole of doctor visits/scans that I've done in the last 6 months, but none have produced even a remotely accurate diagnosis, let alone a diagnosis at all. Let me give you a quick rundown/timeline:\n\n**July 2018:** Had right femoral hernia surgery after what was most-likely a work-out injury. Took about a month to fully recover from this and get back into my daily routine.\n\n**\\~ October 2018:** I began having a very infrequent twitching on the right side of my left foot. About two weeks after this symptom started, I started having discomfort when sitting down for long periods of time. Eventually I couldn't sit for more than 20 mins at a time -- and I still can't.\n\n**Early November 2018:** After a few clinic visits (along with an X-ray and CT scan that showed nothing irregular), my primary doctor referred me to physical therapy to help try to alleviate the issue of my inability to sit down for prolonged periods.\n\n**Late November 2018:** I had extremely serious pangs where my hernia surgery was (right testicle had sharp pain that practically disabled me for a week). Saw my general surgeon and he gave me some effective relief with Naproxyn and Gabapentin. Still having trouble sitting down for long periods of time.\n\n**December 2018:** My doctor decided to have me take Gabapentin for about 3 months to try to see if it alleviated anything. During this time, I also started taking Sertraline because of anxiety was having about this entire debacle.\n\n**January 2019:** Ended physical therapy -- helped a bit with stretching (I am pretty freaking stiff, especially hamstrings), but did nothing for my sitting issue.\n\n**February 2019:** Had three MRI's done. All came back perfectly normal -- left and right hip showed nothing, just the repair on my hernia. My lower back MRI was fine as well.\n\n**Today:** Still can't sit down for long periods of time without getting extremely uncomfortable. A new symptom I've noticed: I used to be able to walk a lot more, but now my testicles rise (get tight) and my anal area will itch. This symptom would be right next to the part of my butt/leg that gets uncomfortable when sitting down. It's also a few inches away from where my hernia surgery was.\n\n**Things I can't do:** Sit down for more than about 15-20 mins. Laying down on my back (puts pressure on my butt and irritates whatever is wrong after a while).\n\n**Things I can do with no issues:** Stand for prolonged periods of time (I have a standing desk now). Laying down on my side. Laying down on my stomach. Squat all the way to the ground. Basic stretches.\n\nHere's a link to diagram that shows where I've felt very tender (though it's on and off when standing/laying down), which is the area that becomes uncomfortable when sitting down on it: [https://imgur.com/a/CWTFIOf](https://imgur.com/a/CWTFIOf)\n\nI'm personally thinking it's a nerve issue (being that there's still twitching in my foot ever so often -- I just don't know if it's a standalone issue, or if muscles/tendons are causing this issue.\n\n\\[I've started seeing a new physical therapist in the last two weeks (who I think is much more competent and knowledgable than where I went originally).\\]\n\nIn my last conversation with my doctor in the last week, she told me it could be scar tissue from the surgery that's causing these issues, so she's going to look for a specialist who does post-op massage work.\n\nThat would be a shot in the dark at this point for me, but I literally have no clue what else to do -- I feel completely and totally stuck and it's driving me mad. I've had to miss out on several traveling opportunities because of this issue.\n\nIf you want anymore information, or if you have someone you can recommend that I talk to, that would fantastic -- feel free to ask any questions you may have.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

My feet get sweaty while I\u2019m at work, which is at a hospital so I\u2019m on my feet all day. Normally, this isn\u2019t an issue. I just come home, peel the socks off and go about my business.

It was able to be smelled while I was fully standing up so I\u2019d assume my coworkers are just being nice. Anyway, I realized that my Vans were wet when I removed them each day. So I switched to every other day. My other pair of shoes, which are under armor shoes that breathe, had the same smell occurring. They were old so I threw both away and got a new pair. I just bought a new pair of under amor shoes yesterday that breathe well, and I even bought epsom salt to soak my feet and try to kill some bacteria. This was all good and dandy with no permeating smells at work. However, when I got home and took my shoes off it smelled rancid. Much like a vinegar smell coming from not only my socks, but also inside of my new shoes. I just soaked my feet again in epsom salt, and I\u2019ve also put powder and a box of Irish spring soap in each shoe to try to rid them of that awful smell. Lastly, my socks are these powersox brand pair with comfort and I believe breathability, but I could be wrong about that.

Since then, these symptoms have gradually gotten worse over time to where i can no longer do any sports, can hardly walk, and have trouble breathing when lying down. The main symptoms are:\n\n* Shortness of breath\n* Tight/pressure feeling in (upper) chest going into my throat. Sometimes feeling like something is stuck in my throat\n* Tight/pressure feeling between shoulder blades\n* Inability to exercise, symptoms worsen significantly upon physical exertion\n* Easily tired\n* Bad recovery (used to be a track athlete, monitored my heart rate (recovery) for several years. Seems significantly worse now).\n\nI never had any troubles with anxiety, but this was the first 'diagnosis' i got. Since then i've seen 3 independent therapists/psychiatrists, all of which have cleared me for any mental health issues after 20+ sessions with each of them. During treatment I was given Zoloft for 4 months and Xanax for several weeks after. Neither of them had any effect on symptoms.\n\nAdditionally i've had an extensive medical work-up;\n\n\\- Heart:\n\n* Standard stress test\n* Cardiopulmonary exercise test\n* Electrocardiogram\n* Echocardiogram\n* Perfusion MRI\n* Intrusive coronarography\n* Chest CT\n\nThe most noteworthy conclusions here were a dilated left atrium, extremely low VO2-max despite having a very active lifestyle shortly before symptoms started and a flattening O2-pulse and disproportionally increasing heart rate at the anaerobic threshold during cardiopulmonary exercise test.\n\n\\- Gastroenterological\n\n* 2x endoscopy\n* Manometry\n* 24h ph test\n\nThese revealed relatively mild GERD and a small hiatal hernia. After treatment with pantomed 40mg for several weeks these issues resolved, but symptoms stayed the same.\n\n\\- Lungs\n\n* Tested for asthma, negative\n\n\\- Brain, neurology\n\n* Bran MRI\n* Several other test for neurological diseases.\n\nAll normal.\n\n\\- Muskoskeletal\n\n* Several chiropractors, physiotherapists.\n\nWas checked and treated by several therapists. Did not seem to help and could not give me a clear diagnosis. Didn't find any severe problems.\n\n\\- Hyperventilation\n\n* Ruled out by blood tests several times.\n* Treatment by a certified hyperventilation therapist for 4 months. Ruled out hyperventilation as a cause.\n* Followed several courses focused on breathing (mindfullness, meditation).\n\nMy doctors have been wonderful and provided my with an extensive medical workup. However they don't know where to turn next. My situation is still deteriorating to where i had to quit my job and moved back in with my parents as i can no longer take care of myself.

Why i do this because it helped me to get sleep. And about a year ago I made a mistake of not eating or light eating any food for 2-3 days. This messed up my immune system and i started feeling weakness throughout my body. And doing intense physical activities or going to the gym cured this and i was fine as long as i went to gym. Skipping the gym one or two days didn't matter either.\n\nPart two - The desease\n\nSo I moved to canada from india and there was a temperature shift from hot to cold weather. But I don't think it did anything to my body because after arriving in canada for the first four months i was healthy. I would even say I felt more physically capable and healthy than i felt even in india. So let me begin telling actually what problem I have. Actually one day I was coming home from work. I work at a food storage warehouse where I have to pickup heavy items that weigh around 30-40 kgs and have to move from cold to normal room\ntemperature storage every 20 mins or so. I was coming home from work and when I came home I got sick. And I felt it at 3 a.m in the morning. So I did what I would do back home. I took anti allergic, Paracetamol 375mg and anti-biotics. I took these tablets for 2-3 days. I would say that I felt better after two days. On the third day the problem started, I took the same three tablets on the morning of the third day and I never felt this good. I was very happy that I am normal again then I had to go to work after my college. But after doing my routine work for the warehouse. I felt I was sick again. And this time It was worse,I couldn't think and it was so warm behind my eyes and behind my both ears and I couldn't feel anything around my neck no cold or heat. This went on for two more days till I said enough and it was time for a visit to the doctor\n\nPart Three - Treatment\n\nFirst I went to my college doctor and she didn't even do any test. Because I told him what medicines I have taken paracetamol,anti-allergics and antibiotics. She straightaway told that it was due to antibiotics and can also be due to change in weather and told me to drink water and eat at time. So not knowing anything about medical I went with her advice and starting drinking three to four glasses of water at once and probably drank about triple amount of water I normaly do. This went on for another week but it didn't help. The same symptoms were there. My eyes were very hot and behind my both my ears. And another most important symptoms is the freaking headache I get when I go into places where there is room heating. Suddenly when I go to the area where there is heating a headache will start in my head and this will not go away until I leave the room. And talking or laughing will make it twice as worse. And I am a very talkative guy who will not stop cracking jokes at you and will interac with everyone I can. But all of this stopped because every place I go in canada for e.g my classroom, restaurant and workplaces have this heat on. And now I would avoid even saying hi to another person and be myself because of this. And after visiting my college doctor I went to another doctor. This time he checked he found that there was tension in my muscles of my back shoulder area he gave me naproxin 500 mg. I took it for around two weeks but it didn't help. I would say it made it worse. So now I went to the emergency ward at my local hospital. And had my ct scan of my head and my blood test done. But nothing was found in the tests everything was normal. \n\nPart Four - Current situation\n\nI will tell you what symptoms I have \n\nI can feel that I have around 20% of energy of what I used to have when I got sick. My neck is like always cracking and I feel I always have to stretch it. This is also the case with my back. And the headache issue is still there when i go into areas where there is heating on. And I do not think I feel normal as I used to till I got sick. I feel my whole body feels about 10% of everything like cold,heat and muscle fatigue of what I used to feel. Another thing I cannot wake up in the mornings I tell you honestly I can sleep for about 14 hours in a day without anybody waking me up. Before getting sick If I got around five hours of sleep It would be enough for me to go through my day. And it does not end I after sleeping for about 14 hours two three hours later I feel the need to sleep again. Also If I am feeling like ok like not what I used to feel. Going to work makes it worse and I feel I should quit everything I am doing and just lay down there. Honestly I am I cannot do anything like studying or interac with anybody because talking with anybody makes the situation worse. And laughing makes it even worse. All these things I have been dealing with for about four months. And no matter where I went nobody were anle to tell what desease I have . Could this be due to a injury to the head. Because I got stuck in the head in the warehouse. But it didn't bleed and also it was after two days after my sickness. \n\nThis is all the detail that I can tell you of what I dealing with. Can anybody please tell me what I have or what I have to do in order to recover to where I was before I got sick. And I am struggling day to day to deal with it. Please can somebody help me.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

A few weeks ago this same thing happened again, and then last weekend it happened again but it seemed to be more random and not stemming for laying on that side. I went to an urgent care. I do get wax buildup from time to time in both ears that they have to remove, and I thought maybe this was something related. The Doctor checked out my ear and said there was no infection and normal amounts of wax. She thought it might be a Eustachian tube dysfunction and prescribed Flonase and ear drops for the pain. The week went ok until about 4 AM this morning I woke up on that side of my head again and this was the worst its hurt yet. It's a stabbing pain that is worse when I lay down. The area in front of my ear on the side of my face near my cheek bone was tender and sore to the touch. It hurt to tug on my ear lobe and my entire ear was very sensitive. I tried some of the ear drops and that made the pain WORSE inside my ear. I took some Advil and sat up for a couple hours until I was able to sleep again. Since then it's been kind of achy but my cheekbone area isn't tender anymore and I can touch/tug my ear. Can just sleeping on this create THIS much pain?

Confirmed not hernia but still no explanation, pain continues.", "author": "JohnCrichtonsCousin", "self_text": "I am a 23 year old male, quite skinny. I have had laparoscopy for my appendix, 3 years ago. No major complications but I feel itching and mild mild pain for nanoseconds at the incisions occasionally. There is no redness and the pain is nowhere near severe, nor prolonged.\n\nAbout 2 years ago I noticed, though was unaware that it was specifically, a swollen lymph node at the groin site, my right side. It was totally painless and I only noticed when mindlessly feeling around my body. A month ago I noticed more had propped up and the original one, now still the biggest, was causing discomfort/minor pain and sort of shooting the same feeling down my right thigh. It felt like it was falling asleep at times and so I began to think it was a femoral hernia. At work one day (cashier at a gas station) the pain was mounting and my anxiety too as femoral hernias can kill you, take your leg in less than an hour. I went to the ER to ensure I didnt die in the next hour.\n\nDoc confirmed it wasn't a hernia. Swollen lymph nodes are usually a sign of infection. We ran a standard blood test. He found no sign of infection. I havent had nearly enough sex with nearly enough people (once) in the past 6 months so it's not an STD. The doc wanted to run more tests but I'm not rich and I have no insurance. I decided to forgo the tests until I set up some insurance and figure it out. The doc didnt seem to think this could be a sign of my laparoscopy going bad. He didnt think my lifestyle and stress alone could produce the symptoms. He really had no explanation and only offered to continue doing tests which I had no patience or payment for.\n\nMore or less I'm looking for information on the various reasons why my lymph nodes are swelling and what it means that its sending pain/tightness/discomfort down my thighs. Trying to search such things brings me down the path of lymphoma, hodgkin's lymphoma or tuberculosis. I'd rather not consider the concept I have either but hodgkins lymphoma is 40% more likely to occur in smokers, which I definitely qualify as, especially this past year.\n\nTo recap: removed appendix via laparoscopy 3 years ago. Lymph node at groin noticeably swollen since around the same time. Same node as well as new ones painfully swollen and sending pain down thighs since a month ago. Recent blood test all normal (no sign of infection). No STDs albeit no tests. Profuse consumption of marijuana and tobacco past year, ceased indefinitely as of two days ago.\n\nIf you need any more info just ask. If my symptoms sound familiar please let me know.

An MRI of my brain  and cervical spine found nothing, and manual manipulation at physical therapy couldn't feel anything out of the ordinary. It has gotten worse over time, so sadly I can't just wait for whatever it is to heal. Even gentle neck stretches cause a strong increase in all symptoms.

Exacerbated greatly by intense physical strain- lifting, intense exercise. Weight lifting, basketball, swimming, biking, no longer tolerable since symptoms began.  Mildly exacerbated during times of increased emotional stress.  Shoulder and neck muscles are sore to touch. Symptoms are relieved somewhat by massage.I currently take one naproxen sodium pill (Aleve) per day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnset of symptoms- Prior to onset of symptoms, I was very active/fit. I lifted weights 3 days a week and did some form of cardio on remaining days of the week- running, biking, or swimming. 15 months ago, I noticed I had an intense headache one particular night following orgasm. I never had this happen before and Googled it and read about benign sex/exertional headache and read that its relatively common and usually heals on its own so I didn\u2019t worry too much about it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day I went to the gym for a routine workout and the same headache returned after the first reps on the first machine (bench press). I stopped and went home but noticed a lingering headache throughout the weekend. I Googled exertion headache and assumed this explained my symptoms. The odd thing is I never had that same intense  headache return after orgasm or physical activity. However, I did retain the chronic neck pain/tension type headache that has never subsided in the 15 months since. I can no longer tolerate any physical activity other than running.I believe running is tolerated because it requires very little neck movement. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSteps taken: I saw a neurologist and explained my symptoms. I had an MRI of my head as well as CT/CTA scan of my head and neck to check for potential vascular issues and both came back perfectly clean. The neurologist thought the headache was probably cervicogenic in nature so suggested physical therapy. I was prescribed corticosterioids to help heal any musculature cause but they were ineffective. I told the neuro I clinch my teeth at night. I was referred to a dentist for tmd relief. I was fitted with a hard mouth guard that ive worn for the last 3 months without noticeable improvement. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe cause of the chronic headache/neck pain does seem to be structural given how much physical activity worsens the symptoms.

What would be the next venue to try to find a working treatment plan?**\n\nI've been suffering some serious fatigue for a long time now. I have doctor records back 10 years complaining about it, but about 2 years ago it has escalated to the point is adversely affecting my life in pretty much all areas. I have already seen a lot of doctors, so really asking what path to pursue now as its very expensive (a specialist will be about $350/visit and a PCP still $150/visit), time consuming, and above all else exhausting to keep seeing doctor after doctor and have to rehash it all over again. Last time I saw a Dr was last April and taking until now to have the energy to consider going again. So I desperately need help but you can imagine why I'm reluctant to just choose one, so would like a little help on finding a best path.\n\nToday I had an episode that scared me, which spurred finally making this post (which I've intended to do for a few years now but again lacked the willpower to power through until today). I was laying in bed and suddenly brain \"clicked on\" and I don't know what happened. I lost about an hour and 15 minutes... I don't know if I was asleep or not, I have no memory whatsoever on what happened. I was there and thinking then suddenly brain clicked back on 75 minutes later with no idea what happened in prior time frame. Normally its a huge struggle to wake up from a nap, this didn't have that, was just awake and then scared I couldn't remember what just happened. I've never lost time before in my life, and have always been well aware of when I'm asleep an well aware of all dreams. I couldn't even tell if my eyes were closed or open in the prior time frame. \n\nI struggle to differentiate the difference, but this feels more like fatigue and less sleepiness. Every single thing I do takes a lot of mental and physical energy to push through. The entirety of my life revolves around saving all energy to get to work and work through the day. I can't do a lot of things anymore. It's been about 2 years since I was able to clean my house... it took me about 8 months to gather the energy to call some housekeepers. I found it in my finances to pay a cleaning crew to come by every 3 weeks so at least my house doesn't look as much as a disaster as I feel. I have the energy to cook every few months anymore. Gardening is a huge passion for me but takes on average about 2 months after buying a plant to actually manage to plant it. I can't drive to visit family anymore because can't stay awake driving. This last year I've done better than year before concerning work, but I still have days where I start passing out on the toilet at work.\n\nPrior to 2 years ago I was fatigued and had excessive sleeptimes several times a week (up to 23 hours straight), but I could resist falling asleep pretty easily, just felt miserable. Then about 2 years ago things changed and was passing out driving, passing out in roadside restrooms, passing out in meetings, just unable to fight it whatsoever. This can be seen below in my low score on the epworth sleep scale (I strongly dislike that survey, I find the terms are very vague and while I can *resist* sleep in most of those situation doesn't mean that I'm not too exhausted to do whatever that activity is).\n\nIn 2015 I had a [sleep study](https://imgur.com/a/te217fc) -- Basically it had me marked as lots of hypopneas and a few apneas. After this I went and tried CPAP for several months, but it never helped and started to cause panic towards end of those few months everytime I tried to put it on. I noticed the actual apneas were almost all central and not obstructive like is common, but none of the hypopneas were marked as either types. I later saw a different neurologist and asked if the hypopneas could be classified too and he said they should have been so ordered another sleep study.\n\nSo 2017 I had the [follow up sleep study](https://imgur.com/a/6ULQSlO) -- nothing abnormal was found. \n\nSo a few weeks later had a [Multiple Sleep Latency Test](https://imgur.com/a/MeVjgdt) -- This one found that I fell asleep for an average of 2.2 minutes in every one of my naps, but no REM so it wasn't a diagnosis of Narcolepsy... so we pursued Idiopathic Hypersomnia treatments. I have tried everything they had and nothing helped at all, none of the medications worked even remotely (adderall, ritalin, welbutrin, dextroamphitamine, modafinil, armodafinil, probably some others). Honestly to my layman understanding the test just proves I'm exhausted but doesn't really mean much beyond that. So now I'm back to looking for alternate explanations and treatments.\n\nDuring that same timeframe I had an echocardiogram to rule out my heart. I saw a psychologist to rule out depression (I do have a history of it, but it's been gone for last 3+ years now and psychologist agreed with me. Though you can imagine that every few weeks or so I (understandably in my mind) get very distressed by my inability to do any of the things I want to do. I've even gone and went through a period of acupuncture treatments as a 'what the hell maybe I'm wrong and it can do something' desperate ploy for help. \n\nI've had the standard blood tests, and everything has [come back fine](https://imgur.com/a/JjmPhTE) (Sorry the format is hard to read for others, its for my own records to keep in one spot since so many different doctors have different sites and info is lost, but figured I'd add here). With the exception of T3, but a few years prior I was told that T3 would be abnormal because I was on birth control then, and again on these blood samples. I was to go off birth control for 4 months then try the blood test again, but Drs dropped ball on me and never scheduled it and took a year for me to remember. I've been off since April of last year, but haven't setup the test yet. \n\nMy general physician hinted it could be CFS, but as that's a dead end diagnosis I still want to pursue other options first. \n\nWhat I'm debating on spending the energy/money on is an endocrinologist, but worried that if blood results have been fine in past, its fine now. Maybe a gastroenterologist as I have had numerous stomach problems since I was a small child, but was told at 10 that it was IBS and never thought twice about it until a few months ago. An allergist? Is it possible to have no other allergy symptoms and be this fatigued? Someone else? \n\n\nOther symptoms.... that I don't really think are related but maybe are?

Anyways, I noticed that the cut was deep enough that something white was showing; like once it was clean and not bleeding I saw a light pink layer and a white line that, for lack of a better imagery, looked like a thin tendon running through or just under the pink layer (not saying that's what it was just what it looks like).

I was referred by my physician, who was the one that diagnosed me with cluster headaches. I'm just really confused and worried by my symptoms, as they don't seem to match anything I've been able to find online. I was hoping some kind soul here would be able to offer insight. Hopefully I can use that information when I see my neurologist as well. \n\nAnyway, about a month ago I had two severe headaches (7/10 pain) on the top right (from my perspective) of my skull, that was followed by burning behind my eye, as well as uncontrollable tearing in the right eye only. The pain lasted less than 60 seconds, the eye burning lasted about a minute. I had seen my physician, who ordered a CAT scan to rule out aneurysms, fractures, tumors, etc., which came back as negative for all. He diagnosed me with cluster headaches. \n\nThat's where this post comes in. The last time I had an attack as described above was March 2nd. Since the visit, my headaches have started to move around my head. Last Wednesday, the 6th, I had a pulsating pain in the back of my head, slightly biased to the left. It was only a 4/10 at its worst, but it caused my nose to become congested, which from what I've read is related to my eye watering. I had one or two more in the back of my head which caused the autonomic symptoms (eye watering/nasal congestion), and others in the originally affected area as well (though they too were only a 4/10 pain at worst). With the exception of one attack which had lasted about 15 minutes of mild pain (1-2), all the headaches covered by the above paragraph lasted under 1 minute, usually in the range of 10-15 seconds, sometimes as long as 30-60. The pain itself usually only lasted a 1-5 seconds at most, with lesser pain lingering/pulsing before or after.\n\nAside from those, which had the autonomic symptoms, I've had tens of headaches, ranging from sensations in the affected areas that were either not painful, or very light pain (1/10), to sharp pains, usually pulsing, that were 3-4/10 at worst. Like the above, the pain itself didn't last very long, and usually pulsed between less pain and more pain. I think it may be worth mentioning the original attacks at the very beginning of all my headaches were sudden, constant pain which went away as suddenly as they came. \n\nI have been keeping a log of all the attacks and pains I've been having since my original two attacks. If anyone is interested in reading that, it can be found [here](https://pastebin.com/ewMFDVQV). \n\n**TL;DR** I've been having atypical clusters of sharp, painful, and some extremely painful headaches that only last a short amount of time and happen all over my head.

My lips have been extremely dry and flakey, my lips being dry has now been constant for almost 2 months now. My face has also gotten incredibly dry recently (to add to the issue). By recent, I mean the past couple of weeks it\u2019s been sandpaper dry, even adding oils and thick layers of moisturizer doesn\u2019t help. I\u2019ve also had digestive problems my whole life, but recently they\u2019ve just gotten a lot worse where everything I eat put me in a lot of pain. I\u2019m lactose intolerant, but anything, even just plain chicken noodle soup is causing discomfort and bloating. The bloating is new. It makes me look seriously pregnant. I\u2019m 5 ft tall and 110 lbs so it looks silly for someone my size to have such a big stomach when I am definitely not pregnant. I\u2019ve also developed terrible memory, really foggy and losing concentration easily. I\u2019m always tired, I don\u2019t know if this was related at all, but might as well put it down. I can sleep 14+ hours a day if I didn\u2019t have responsibilities. Even after sleeping in on days off, I could easily go back to sleep. My depression has gotten a bit worse because of my stagnant lifestyle and my skin getting uglier. \nYesterday though a new weird symptom came up. I felt like I had a big mosquito bite on my cheek, (not itchy though) and a couple hours later noticed they were all over my face. I ended up falling asleep and woke up to my entire face swollen like a balloon, no welts anymore. One of my eyes was almost swollen shut. My skin felt super dry (even worse than usual) and really really tight. My throat felt itchy. I went to urgent care and they had no idea why my face was doing that so they put me on prednisone (2 in the AM, 1 benedryl at night for 5 days) and called it a day. My face is still pretty puffy, it\u2019s just my 2nd day on the meds though so I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll go down some more. \nBut what the heck is causing this!? All these skin issues are pretty new and weird to me. I don\u2019t eat anything out of the ordinary, I use pretty clean products, foods, etc. i went to the doctor today ( the urgent care suggested I do some blood tests soon to rule out any infections or immune system issues) and my PCP said I don\u2019t need to do any of those, I probably have a hidden allergy and referred me to an allergist. My mom thinks I should get thyroid levels tested instead. Does a thyroid test seem like a good idea here? Or just an allergy test? Maybe something else?

Every morning when I wake up, my muscles are pulsating very fast. It seems to be concentrated to my back muscles, glutes, thighs, calves and triceps. . You know when you stretch really hard, and when you get to the very end of that stretch there's a \"vibration\" of sorts? That's what I'm feeling. \n\nI thought I was having heart paliptations when it first started happening, as it was mostly in my upper back, and felt like it was my chest, but a mobile ECG for four days, and an ultrasound confirmed that my heart is in good working order, and my blood work also came back good, and my thyroid levels were good. \n\nPrimary care doc ordered X-Rays of the neck and spine, and everything was ok. After the panic of my heart failing and being on the verge of death subsided, I've started trying to pinpoint exactly what I'm feeling and when. I've found that it ONLY happens at night, when I'm lying down. I've also found that if I hold my breath for a few seconds, the shaking/pulsating in my back will stop and if I lift my legs even half a centimeter off the bed, they will stop as well. The moment I put them back down, it starts again, the moment I start breathing, it starts again in my back. \n\nWhen I stand up within a few seconds, it's gone. I've got a Tuft and Needle foam mattress and found that if I lay down on that, within just a few minutes I'll start feeling it in my legs, and then my back, but if I lay down on my guest bed which is as hard as a concrete slab, it'll take much longer to start. I'm starting to wonder if it's possible  that there's some sort of nerve compression going on, and perhaps with the softer Tuft and Needle it's happening faster than with the uncomfortable bed. \n\nPrimary care doc is a bit baffled by this. He did notice that I had some tightness in my hips, specifically on my left side and suggested doing some yoga to stretch out a bit. Only medications I'm on are atenolol and lexapro to keep my heart rate down and lower the panic attacks/anxiety I was having because of this. I've been doing some basic stretches the last few days and I'm definitely tight, but nothing seems to have really made a difference so far. \n\nAny ideas? \n\ntl;dr muscles pulsating only at night, only when laying in bed, bloodwork and thryroid ok, heart diags ok, no tremors or pulsating when standing.

Also it will be a long one, but I will be eternally grateful for any advice! \n\nI'm currently 35 weeks pregnant. At 25 weeks\u00a0 I visited my GP because I was suffering from rinitis, gingivitis, sore throat and slightly swollen lymph nodes under my jaw (bilateral) for about 2 months. My GP told me to use saline nasal spray and that pregnancy is known to cause all of the above. \n\nAt 28 weeks I noticed a strange growth on my left tonsil, went back to the GP and got an urgent ENT referral. ENT took a look and said: oh it's just a papilloma, they are very common, we will remove it after you give birth (papilloma is 3x2mm in size). He said: don't worry, it's benign, enjoy your pregnancy. He also said that my mouth, tonsils, throat,\u00a0 nose and ears are otherwise healthy and normal. He said my lymph nodes do not concern him, that they are just reactive to gingivitis and whatnot.\u00a0 \n\nFast forward to week 32 of my pregnancy when i caught a bad cold, did strep test which was negative and said to myself it's just a viral bug and it will pass. BUT a few days later my left tonsil started to hurt like hell. \nFor the past few weeks I've had a feeling that there is a popcorn shell stuck under my left tonsil. It is getting more and more uncomfortable and scarry cause the pain is only on the left side. \n\nLast friday I went back to the ENT, again he took a look, said everything is normal, that my tonsil is normal (except for the papilloma), that there is nothing stuck and that the cause of the popcorn shell feeling is my LPR.\u00a0 \nAt this point my lymph nodes are still feeling a bit swollen, soft and very movable (they are that way since November ) but he said that my lymph nodes are normal, small (around 1cm) and barely palpable. \n\nAfter the initial papilloma diagnosis I started googling like crazy and convinced myself that I have throat cancer.\nBy looking at old pictures, from when I had a tooth removed, I have determined that my papilloma has been present for at least 2 years without changing size.\n\nI know I should trust my doctor but I just want a second opinion. \n\nI think my left tonsil looks very weird. Apart from the papilloma it has a very red area on the front that looks different than any other tonsil picture i saw on google. It is not bigger than my other tonsil, just weird. \n\nAnyway here is a picture: [http://imgur.com/zKDa44f](http://imgur.com/zKDa44f) \n\nPlease tell me if this tonsil looks normal to you or if I should go to a different ENT. \n\nDo you think I need a psychiatrist to address my health anxiety?\n\nThank you!

Back then I think I would get sick about once a week, then it changed to about once a month, and now it's once every few months. I have never had this happen back-to-back, there is always decent spacing between episodes.\n\n**What happens:** During the day my stomach will start feeling acidic and somewhat crampy, then when evening comes I will become nauseous and often end up vomiting throughout the night. During this time I am usually doubled over from the stomach pain, which feels fiery like acid. Bowl and urinary movements don't seem to be affected at all, and by the morning I am usually feeling mostly better. If I have a more mild episode or take some ibuprofen (rarely) and make it through the night without vomiting, then the feeling will usually linger for about a week or so.\n\n**My thoughts:** I highly doubt this is food poisoning since it happens so regularly. I cook almost all my food and am very careful about keeping things clean. I also tend to doubt this is allergy related as well because I can eat the same food after an episode without getting sick again (to my knowledge I don't have any food allergies).\n\nWhen I have mentioned this to doctors before they have not been overly concerned by it, and made it seem like it would be a lot of work to diagnose it, so I have just been living with it.

Given small cup of lidocaine gel, told to se as needed til gone, which does nothing (neither has any other topical.) \nFrom then to now: few ER visits with nearly the same results, one even just said get orajel (after being told benzo and lido dont work.) \nWisdom teeth removed by army (for no reason other than \"they can cause pain later,\" this was common in '08 usa apparently) and even though i had to bite this thing on a machine which took wild xrays and pictures, the tech and dentist said nothing of the bump.\n\nAll that explained, i'll link here and at the end: https://imgur.com/a/f2IdVNa\n\nSame thing happening over the years, it gets soft and hard at random, sometimes when its \"empty\" it even concaves, making me believe the malic acid has affected the plate under the skin, and maybe thats where the fluid comes from (mucus??) and it gets big at almost random (mostly acidic things cause, but so does my tongue or food pushing on it a little now and then) and even when its big, sometimes its very hard and sometimes its soft.\nThe fluid inside seems like maybe it has grittiness (debris?) and it tastes a little metallic, and a little like blood sometimes, but it has a yellow brown color more like iodine solution.\n\nCurrent symptoms: Throbbing, almost blinding at times pain. Pressure under my nose. Pain in aforementioned crooked tooth. Large swollen area, dense but not completely hard... Like a beach ball overfilled with air. Painful to touch, and intense pressure as well. After writing this i found also that by pressing my cheek pretty much where it meets my nose on the side of the bump, it has a connected pain.

I initially worried about it cause of a bout of DP (found it's a symptom). Then that went away and some other symptom would arise..like a tremor or word finding issues. Both resolved.\n\nFor 2 wks, my sleep schedule has been bad. I ended up in a pattern where I couldn't fall asleep till 5am, 6, 7....then 10am. For the past 6 days...I sleep from 10am-3pm. I've been trying to sleep at 12 or 1 but I just lay there for hours failing. It doesn't help that i'm having closed eye hallucinations EITHER.\n\nI see blobs/fuzz in the dark..which is normal vision fluff. When I close my eyes, those change to images. Sometimes they are moving/stacking triangles but usually they are ppl or realistic scenes (If you stare at something bright and then close your eyes... you still see it vividly for a second right? It's like that) I can see it on the backs of my eyelids...AND when I open my eyes in the dark too! It lasts about 10 sec.\n\nThis happens to me every time I try to sleep now. I lay down and go \"what if it happens? What's it mean?\" I just have that fear when I know i have to go to bed. Then an image pops up and my heart races cause I'm worried. Once I DO fall asleep, those images are a thing of the past. Like, I can wake up, pee, come back to bed, and go back to sleep without issue. I don't know if it's cause I'm expecting these.. therefore they pop up (?) I don't even know if that's possible. I do know that when I'm relaxed from waking..the vigilance for those images is gone. I wake up normal and it just doesn't happen.\n\nI was looking up this phenomenon and I see MANY people ask about \"images I see when closing eyes\". Most complain about seeing faces upon eye closure, and the faces look projected onto their eyelids... like me.\n\nFor the past 2 days I've had brain farts. I keep thinking hallucinations + dementia = CJD\n\nYesterday\ufeff I was in the bath and questioned which faucet handle was cold/hot. Like, I thought about it BEFORE I tried BECAUSE I was nervous about how worried I'd be if I picked the wrong one. I turned on the left one thinking it was hot but it wasn't.. then I got scared.\n\nAfterwards, I checked my weight on a beam scale (which I use a lot) and the notch bit on the end (that you use to determine whether to move the slider left/right) was down and I questioned whether I move the slider left/right to balance it out. I remembered, but for that 1 second, I forgot. \ufeffI also confused a goat for a donkey, an otter for a beaver!\n\nLast week I was playing poker online (which I do a lot) and it came to my bet and I got confused. I had 100k chips and the bet was 2k and for a sec, I questioned how much 2k was..I just stared and contemplated it (isn't that odd?). I figured it out right away..but for that second, I was lost! Afterward i did an online math test to make sure my brain was ok...and my answers were usually right (and i did every single equation in my head.).\n\nToday, I got some Pad Thai and mine had these unique, 1 inch wide noodles in it. Tons of bean sprouts, white onions, etc. I acknowledged the noodles before i ate...right? I was watching tv and I bit into a bean sprout thinking it was a small noodle...but it was crunchy, so i dug my fork to find the noodles and then I suddenly realized I was digging around noodles, looking for...noodles.\n\nNow I'm worried I have sCJD cause I fear the memory issues I listed are too severe to be anxiety related. People with anxiety don't get confused like that, they just don't pay attention...like forgetting where your keys are, putting coffee in cereal, or what you went into a room for...these are normal and the posts I see from people are like that..not like mine.\n\nI don't have ataxia, dysdiadochokinesia, apraxia, etc. I do these tests to myself:\n\n\\* I can run my heel up and down either shin perfectly\n\n\\* I can walk tandem barefoot\n\n\\* I can do the rapid hand alternating test perfectly in sync and really fast\n\n\\* I don't have vision problems (though i have a congenital lazy eye)\n\n\\* I can name 25-30 animals per min\n\n\\* I can draw a clock perfectly for \"10 past 11\" and the short hand is on 11 and long hand on 2.\n\ni'm not using this as a substitute. I don't fear a doctor.. i'm just (hoping) for some sort of reassurance for any of this for at least a moment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

To give a little personal background,  I'm a 25 y/o F, 5'8 height and 160 lbs from Canada. One morning around...I would say 10 years ago or so, I had been chatting to a family member. The next think I remember is coming to in a different room, convulsing violently and having bitten through my lip. I had no recollection of the previous 10 minutes, how I had gotten to that room, or anything. My doctor had thought it was due to blood sugar dropping. I thought that would be the one and only time I would experience this, but I have had these attacks at least 20 times since. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey vary in symptoms, but the symptoms that always reoccur are my vision going black and uncontrollable shaking of my limbs. I've only lost consciousness once. I am always standing when this occurs. I'm very careful not to stand up too quickly in case that was a trigger, but it doesn't seem to have made a difference. I've experienced extreme pain during one attack in my stomach. Half the attacks involve me full out dropping into what seems to be violent convulsions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost recently, I had been on the phone when an attack happened. My vision went black, I began shaking, but this time my speech slurred and slowed, before stopping completely. I had a hard time understanding what was being said on the other end of the line, and this lasted about 15 seconds. I couldn't afford missing work so I still went in, but coworkers had noticed speech was more difficult for me, and that I had to really think about my words before speaking. The front of my head felt very tingly, and so I went down to an Urgent Care center. Blood sugars and EKG were normal. They suggested I was possibly dehydrated and that was that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have had an MRI in 2012, multiple EKGs, EEGs, 2 seizure tests, a visit to a neurologist, two Holter monitors. I have been given various different answers for each attack: abdominal migranes, low blood pressure, dehydration, period pain, a fainting spell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a little bit of background in Neuroscience, and to me I'm concerned they haven't done more to check neurological symptoms. I could be wrong. It's just after my speaking ability was affected, the previous diagnoses leave me confused. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCould anyone provide any insight or even possible guesses as to what they think might be going on, or any health-related avenues I should follow? It's greatly appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you everyone!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nletthatvegetaalone ", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Here\u2019s the story:\nI\u2019m a 25 year old female, 5\u20194\u201d 108lbs. Last October, I fell ill one day (vomiting/high fever) and went to the ER where they discovered a 5.4cm (left) adrenal mass. Mid December 2018, I had an endocrine surgeon laparoscopically perform an adrenalectomy. My pre-surgical labs were seemingly normal although my cortisol levels were a little elevated the few times we ran labs. \n\nBiopsy: Benign/cystic mass\n\nAfter surgery, I slowly noticed various hormonal fluctuations. I weighed 132lbs at the time of surgery. Between January 30th-February 14th 2019, I rapidly dropped down to 108lbs (no appetite). I developed severe insomnia, paranoia, my hair was falling out, excessive thirst, and blurred vision. We began multiple weekly labs from the end of January-until now. I tested positive for the GAD antibody (which means I\u2019m a carrier for type 1 diabetes, although my glucose levels are inconclusive with a diabetes diagnosis), my cortisol levels had nearly tripled (which is surprising because high cortisol is paired with weight gain and I was experiencing the exact opposite), my TSH/T3 began to elevate, my FSH/LH levels suddenly became deficient leaving me infertile. We ran an ACTH and ACTH stim which indicated my one adrenal gland was functioning fine, and the thyroid ultrasound looked normal. We determined my T3/TSH elevation was a response to something going on in the system. I have 6 specialists trying to solve my case. \n\nTheories:\nSo far, it is believed that my pituitary gland could be enlarged or possibly even have a hormone secreting tumor. My endocrine surgeon is looking into the possibility that I could\u2019ve had a hybrid pituitary/adrenal tumor the whole time when this all started and never knew it. I have an MRI scheduled this evening to rule out anything pituitary-related. When I told them I had PCOS at 14 years old, they added that to the equation and pulled up an MRI from 2009 of my ovarian cysts. The specialist noticed a small lesion developing on my left adrenal gland while reviewing my MRI file from 10 years ago.  \n\nTL;DR: Hormones are crazy after unilateral adrenalectomy, extremely high cortisol levels post surgery but experiencing rapid weight loss, lab work is not making ANY sense", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

She  let me know that her left cheek began to tingle, as well as her left  arm. We immediately went to the ER (with the fear of a stroke) and she  was given a set of tests and everything seemed fine. The doctors  mentioned that it might have been due to de-hydration and maybe too much  caffeine (She is not a heavy coffee drinker).\n\nThe  symptoms have continued since then, and even after 2 additional doctor  visits, we are still unsure on what might be going on. Below, I will  describe - to my best capability - all of the symptoms and also mention  all the tests that have been done so far;\n\nAll of the below symptoms pretty much began at the same time, though their presence time seems to fluctuate.  \nIt  always effects her left side, a tingling sensation that shoots up and  down her neck, up to the temple and down to the chest/armpit area by her  side boob. Sometimes it also extends to the arm as well. On occasion it  is just the cheek, or just one of those parts, or sometimes it is all  of them flared up at the same time.  \nShe has had it happen and present throughout an entire day, sometimes twice every week, and sometimes not around for weeks.  \nIn  addition, she also feels a lump on each boob, by the armpits. Left one  causes pain and discomfort, whereas the right now has no pain but can be  felt. No nipple discharge or issues with the shape or color. She gets  extra worried about this due to her previous experience with a lump that  had to be surgically removed at a younger age.  \nTo perhaps tie into a  large scale of possible \"period-cycle\" issues, her ovaries sometimes  will have a shooting pain, by her abdomen. Not as often as the other  symptoms, but it does come and go. (I know this might not be related,  but I thought I would add since her symptoms do seem to get worse during  or around her period).  \nShe has semi-common migraines, and they have  sort of changed on how they manifest themselves. She says she used to  have them causing pain all over her head (generally temples and behind  the eye) but not it is just on her left side.\n\nShe has had:  \nMRI, CT-Scan, Ink/dye injection, and basic breast exams and physicals, as well as an ultra-sound on her ovaries.\n\nEverything  came out negative, however she continues to have issues nearly on a  daily basis, to a point where it will keep her up at night or will wake  her up in the middle of her sleep. When she puts hot towels and heating  on her left shoulder, it seems to truly relieve her pain, albeit for a  short time.\n\nWhat is going on here? It  is causing a lot of stress and effect on her mental health. I know the  details here might be vague and sort of all over the place, but any sort  of a feedback will be highly appreciated.\n\nThank you again and looking forward to your feedback!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

But the problem is that I started **intrusively** remembering more and more memories about different events from ANY age, from something embarrasing I did when I was 3 years old to something I did that morning (e.g I said something corny to a coworker, or expressed my emotions intensely to someone who might misunderstood me etc etc... pretty much ANYTHING comes up now).\n\nKeep in mind, when I think purposely about these \"uncomfortable\" memories, I get no such emotional response. Only when they come intrusively, usually by train of thought. Eg. I smell Ice cream, I start remembering tons of memories about eating ice cream, and as this train of thought rides, I fall onto an \"uncomfortable\" memory about ice cream. Then I respond with a vocal tic instictively, and the intense emotion goes away.\n\nI really feel like its getting worse. I worry sometimes that it might get out of hand.

Some strange form of PTSD, where there is no single particular trauma but my whole life is consisted of multiple traumatic experiences.\n2. OCD.

I always had trouble connecting with others - made fun of in middle school. I believe I have high IQ\n5. Schizophrenia - Schizoaffective disorder.

Sometimes i get the \"feeling\" that everyone can read each others thoughts to a certain extend, but its something that is forbidden to talk about, and its kind of a \"secret\".... Or that my life is the only thing that exists...or that when Im around people and they are having a private conversation, what they are talking about is hinting at me based on their assumptions of my personality. Of course I know these thoughts are not really true, but Im not convinced either)\n\nAlso my thought patterns are weird.

I've also had swollen lymph nodes and really painful joints that are sometimes really puffy and swollen, and low grade fever/chills/flu aches/cold sweats that come and go throughout the week. It started from a cold I got on new years. My doctor couldn't see anything wrong with my throat so he sent me to an ENT who suspected thyroglossal cyst, but it was just a lymph node. ENT said it was inflammatory not infectious (no tests for that, just based on how it looks and my history), gave me a referral to a rheumatologist but the wait is several months. I've also gotten 2 more colds in the past month, and my joints are ballooning in response to the colds. I started the autoimmune protocol diet 2 weeks ago to try to self-treat in the meantime.\n\nMedical history: For 4 years, I had periodic fevers between 101-104 degrees that would last 2 weeks at a time and come back every month. My symptoms were cold sweats, chills, aches, spending weeks in bed shivering and sweating and feeling like I have the flu. I saw a periodic fever syndrome specialist (out of state because there are few specialists, and the doctor moved to an even further state so I am not in touch with him), and I apparently have the familial mediterranean fever gene r761h but my symptoms were too severe to fit the FMF diagnosis. I had a trial run with colchicine which was useless. I have not tried steroids or biologics.  I was taking lamictal at the time for depression, and the fever specialist suggested that the meds could be the cause of my periodic fevers. I took the lamictal for the same 4 years that I had the fever issues, and my fevers started a month after I started taking the drug, so the timing added up. I slowly weaned off the meds, and my flares got less severe with each reduction in the dose. \n\nI got off lamictal 5 months ago and enjoyed 2 glorious months with no fevers!

Should I get bloodwork to check for infection or immunodeficiencies or inflammatory markers? Or just wait for the rheumatologist appointment?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Very large wall of text incoming.\n\n-Male, 6'4, 185 lbs, 25 years old\n-very athletic and active normally, played D1 Volleyball\n-used to smoke cannabis, more recently switched to vaporizing. Completely stopped since these symptoms began.\n\nIt started 3 months ago with a cold. My GF and I both caught the same bug, it seemed like. My cough was way worse. I stopped vaping because it seemed like a logical thing to do. One night, after consuming ramen before going to play volleyball, I gradually began to have a feeling of something stuck down my throat. If I had taken a guess, I thought I had a noodle draped over the opening of my larynx and the rest of my esophagus. I freaked out badly. Went to the bathroom, hacked and coughed and puked like it was life or death. Literally never puked like that in my life. Puked while doing a handstand. I was desperate. No luck. Went to ER, doctor seemed unphased. Gave me throat numbing solution that didn't even help a little bit. Said it'll subside, don't worry. Feeling lasts several days. Slowly fades. Still never feel 100% though. Lung issues persist. \n\nThen, one night, I have an episode where I feel like I'm starving for oxygen. Rush to ER. Given breathing treatment and prescription for albuterol. Breathing treatment helped me cough up some stuff that was clearly sticking around. \n\nVisit to primary care doc. Get prescribed antibiotics, prednisone, symbicort inhaler. Seems to help some. Sickness is basically all but finished. Still not 100% but getting better.\n\nOne night, out of the blue, start feeling uneasy. Heart rate spikes to 135bpm and stays there for the course of the next 3 or 4 hours. Start to feel throat constriction. Another ER visit. Basically written off, given prescription for 10 doses of Ativan for anxiety. I do have a history of anxiety, but mine seems centered around symptoms that I feel. Not the other way around. The one comment the doc does make is an abnormally low dip in the \"Q wave\" on my EKG they performed to test my vitals. While he suspects all I'm experiencing is heart burn turning into asthma symptoms, he says that could be an indication of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. This could have caused the unusual spike in my heart rate and the feeling of unease. \n\nVisit to primary care doc again. He thinks anxiety is the answer but refers me to a cardiologist. I'm supposed to go have another EKG/stress test done. Prescribed hydroxyzine for anxiety, and Effexor, which after researching, I refuse to take.\n\nLately I've been experiencing worsening symptoms related to heart and breathing. The hydroxyzine doesn't do anything for me to be honest. The best help for me as of yet has been benadryl to combat the throat constricting feeling. I don't think a mere globus sensation is helped by benadryl, but that's just me. I had one severe episode that seemed mostly heart related, where I decided to take a nap to get through it. My GF reports that the bags under my eyes and my lips tirned bluish, although it could have been lighting. I felt as if every time I drifted off I would catch myself not breathing, and that has persisted and gotten worse every night. Almost as if my lungs want to deflate and not reinflate. The last two days I've started to feel pressure in my chest as well. I haven't yet seen the cardiologist as there was a blizzard and had to reschedule.\n\nTL/DR;\n\nBad cold, random feeling of aspirated noodle at one point. Develops bronchitis. Clears up after treatment. Then comes heart palpitations/arrhythmia, throat constriction. Currently feeling bouts of throat constriction, and inability to catch breath. Also developing feeling of pressure in chest. All this is accompanied by feelings of impending doom. Resting heart rate is normally 55. Usually now sits around 70 ish at best. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy? Anxiety? Wtf is happening to me??? Someone please help.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I am a 27 year old male and this problem has been going on for half a year now. It started when, over the course of two days, I  experienced brutal diarrhea (thanks to laxative pills I took) which caused a thrombosed hemorrhoid. I then had, what felt like, some seriously inflamed intestines/rectum and burning/smelly urine. This was a terrible experience that lasted several days and I've never experienced anything like this in my lifetime (I believe I've have some form of IBS for most of my life, though I've never been diagnosed).\n\nThe symptoms calmed down for about a month and then started acting up again. I assumed this was all the hemorrhoid's doing (since I had never had a thrombosed hemorrhoid before, I assumed that was causing all of this). A visit to the rectal surgeon (for a sigmoidoscopy) solved nothing, as he said there wasn't anything obvious down there and so he sent me to get my stomach/esophagus examined. So the next month (three months into this problem) I got a gastroscopy, and by then I was becoming bloated every day and couldn't eat much anymore. This gastroscopy revealed a ton of inflammation (GERD) in my stomach and so I was put on anti-inflammation/anti-acid medicine (still am on it). This medication perfectly fixed the bloating and stomach acid/heartburn. The problem was, this didn't solve the main issue of the monthly intestine/rectum/urine flareups. And this problem continued to cause havoc every 4-5 weeks, lasting about a week each time. Even worse, after a follow-up with the gastroscopy doctor, he told me I had a several fissures in my anus. Once hearing that, I wrongly assumed THOSE were the cause of all of my discomfort. But... here I am a month later back in the same position.\n\nCurrently I'm right in the middle of the fifth or sixth flare-up and so I can explain exactly how it all goes down. The whole process is as follows: It starts with some lower intestine/bladder/rectum soreness or inflammation which is triggered by absolutely nothing at all (I've specifically tried looking for any patterns in these flare-ups and there are none). After two days of this, accompanied by some increasingly irritating bowel movements, the symptoms worsen. Lots of gas comes, the anus starts puffing up and getting very red, and the rectal passageway begins to feel very inflamed. The feeling of needing to have a bowel movement lasts through much of the day (this is by FAR the worst part of all of this). Bloating, in what seems to be the upper intestine (or lower stomach) area, happens as well. On the third or fourth day from initially noticing the symptoms, diarrhea will start. Almost everything eaten seems to turn into diarrhea, or causes lots of irritation in the lower stomach / upper intestine area. In some cases the diarrhea will be almost completely liquid. The pain/inflammation in the anus/rectum is constant throughout the day, usually coming and going every hour or so. It completely goes away when sleeping, but comes right back upon waking up. Urine becomes very smelly and darker in color and there is slight burning during/after urination. This is the most confusing part - as almost nothing I've looked up affects both the urine and anal passage simultaneously. Unless, of course, there's something I'm missing. I assume, however, that the fissure/hemorrhoid/anus issues are probably a result of everything else going on and not the problem itself (which is contrary to what I've thought all this time).\n\nI should note that as of last week I assumed this was a prostate problem, possibly Chronic Prostatitis, due to the fact that it was affecting both my urine and anus. But after going through all of this again this week, I don't think that's the case due to all of the stomach/intestinal pain, but I'm even more confused. I think the main key to all of this is the fact that there's a urine AND rectal problem happening at the same time during these flare-ups. I'll be going for another gastroscopy in a month (along with a sigmoidoscopy at the same time) followed by a visit to the urologist. I may just need a colonoscopy at this point.\n\n I seriously would appreciate anybody who's gone through anything similar or has any advice. I'm extremely confused by all of this and becoming more and more nervous at the fact that problem this doesn't seem to be going anywhere.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Also, I want to give the below written list of symptoms to my doctor (before I just talked to him about it)and was wondering if anyone has any questions about them so I can make sure I include all important factors.\n\nThank you very very much for your replies.\n\n**Summary**\n\nSince the beginning of September I have been feeling symptoms (fatigue, lack of sex drive, falling asleep easily at night, vivid dreams, mood change). These symptoms have had a very negative affect on my life and it feels something is very wrong.\n\nI began feeling these symptoms right after I took melatonin supplements (I know melatonin does not usually cause this. I do not know if it did or not but it feels very much like it did and that I would not be experiencing this if I did not take melatonin).\n\n**Main Symptoms**\n\n*Fatigue/Lack of Energy:* In general, I feel like to do not have much energy or \u201csecond wind\u201d. I have always been into fitness (I am a long distance runner) and still work out often at the gym often (usually at least 90 minutes which consists of cardio and light weights 5 days a week) but in general I am more tired.\n\n*Lack of Sex Drive*: This is a very noticeable symptom. I have almost a complete loss of sex drive. I feel like I could not have sex or masturbate for months and months (maybe even a year), and not be bothered at all by it. I do not ever or get very very minimal erections if at all. I do not get morning erections or if I do they would be very minimal.\n\n*Falling Asleep Easily*: I fall asleep easily at night. Since September I can remember any night when I was \u201ctrying to fall asleep but could not\u201d. Before I slept \u201cpretty well\u201d (I would not think I had any issues sleeping) but not perfect (every once in a while I would fall asleep and could not). I only wake up to go to the bathroom and besides that it feels that I sleep deeply. I sleep more than I used to (I used to sleep 7-8 hours and now I sleep 8-9 hours and can sleep 9-10 on the weekend when I do not have to get up for work).\n\n*Vivid Dreams*: I have been having very vivid semi-lucid dreams every night (before I barely dreamt at all or if I did I never remembered doing it). The dreams are enjoyable and are of just random things.\n\n**Other Symptoms (these symptoms are tough to describe or I am less sure of them)**\n\n*Mood Change*: I have a mood change that is tough to describe. In general I would say I am more calm/relaxed.\n\n*Hair Loss*: I notice hairs on my desk at work often. You would not notice if looking at me but I believe I am experiencing hair loss.\n\n**When I Began Experiencing This**\n\nI began experiencing this after I took melatonin. I drank a drink called NeuroSleep that I got at the grocery store ([https://drinkneuro.com/pages/sleep](https://drinkneuro.com/pages/sleep)). I did not really have much trouble sleeping (I would only wake up sometimes if it was really hot out. My AC in my apartment is loud so I would shut it off when I go to bed sometimes). I did not know much about melatonin and did not think it would work (I thought it was like Vitamin Water and would not affect me that much) I drank about half a bottle one night and it worked very well. I slept very deeply and was in a great mood for the next two days. Two days after I tried NeuroSleep I drank a whole bottle. While it made my sleep deep, when I woke up it felt like something was very wrong. I felt headache/irritability/and depression. These symptoms wore off in a week but the other symptoms very much persisted.\n\n**Other Factors (Just in Case this Helps)**\n\nAt the time I took the melatonin I was good mood. I was exercising a lot (at least 60 minutes a day and up to three hours which consisted of a lot of jogging). Also I recently found out that I passed a tough exam for the Chartered Financial Analyst Level 2 Exam (I took the exam at the end of June and Found out that I passed on in the middle of August). The exam was stressful (they say you need to study at least 300 hours to pass and I did at least that). August is also a busy month for work. I would describe my mood as a bit burned out but victorious (because I passed) and happy that I finally got some time to enjoy my summer (golfing, going to the beach, hanging out with friends) and got back into fitness after a winter/spring of studying.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I received an MRI that said \u201con coronal T2 imaging, there is a subtle suggestion of an 8mm round mass in the right posterior pituitary gland. This causes minimal bulge in the right side of the suprasellar cistern. Impression: possible right pituitary tumor.\u201d \n\nSo I had a dedicated MRI of the pituitary, in which another radiologist said \u201cno evidence of pituitary macroadenoma or DEFINITE microadenoma.\u201d\n\nMy primary care doctor (who ordered the MRI) said that this was proof of no adenoma and that we will pursue something else. However, I\u2019m somewhat skeptical of him because i had to have the first radiologist call him to convince him to get the second follow up MRI after he misread the suggestion of the radiologist about getting another dedicated MRI.\n\nDoes phrase \u201cno DEFINITE microadenoma\u201d indicate that it\u2019s not definite but that there MIGHT be a chance there could still be one? It seems like I may have Cushing\u2019s, and my doctor ordered a CT scan for next week of my adrenal glands to check for tumors because the results of the MRI were that there was no tumor but still thinks something is going on with adrenal type stuff. Do you think there needs to be another MRI or does it seem pretty clear from this report that there is no chance of an adenoma? Is it pretty common to show small masses like this and then not to see anything upon a second MRI?\n\nThanks, everyone!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

A little history about me and then I'll go into the current issue. I(34M) have had very good health all throughout my life up until I was about 30 years old. Not even a single broken bone or stitches. Well, except for the time I had my wisdom teeth removed at around 25. When I turned 30, I had blurry vision in my eye so after a couple visits to the doctor; he sends me to an opthalmologist. The opthalmologist finds out I have a large malignant tumor in the orbital socket so I lose my eye. Then I have take 35 sessions of radiation to clear margins. This all takes place in 2016. My eye surgery was in March '16. The first round of radiation is May/June '16. I'm cancer-free for 6 months and then on my second set of imaging, there are some more tumors near the optic chiasma. So I have a gamma knife procedure in the beginning of 2017(maybe February '17). The procedure went smoothly. I was cancer-free for another 6 months but some more tumors were present in the second set of imaging I had to take. This leads to another 35 session radiation treatment. This time around  December '17. Leads into 2018. I was cancer free for another 6 months until I has some more tumors show up around my jawbone. The tumor was visible. Huge bulge around where the hinge for my jawbone is. There is another 35 session radiation treatment that I go through around July/August '18. For some damn reason, my radiation oncologists can't seem to track down my cancer and fry it out of me. 4 damn sessions of radiation! 3 imaging guided radiation treatments and one gamma knife radiation surgery. Now this is pretty much it for my history leading up to my current ailment. \n\nSince 2016, my body has been beaten up from the treatment. This lead me to live a sedentary lifestyle and I gained about 40 lbs. This year(January 2019) I go to the emergency room and have an MRI scan of my spine. It turns out I have herniated L4 and L5 disks. The imaging also shows that I have some inflammation around the nerve that exits the spine at those spots. My symptom is not really pain, although the inflammation does give me something similar to sciatica pain. The symptom that really worried me at the time was that there was no strength in my right leg. After looking up these symptom online, I found out it was something called \"drop foot\". After I found out about my bad disks, I called the pain management doctor I see and he recommended the anti-inflammatory steroid injections in my spine to help relieve the stress on my nerves. This first steroid injection was taken at the end of January '19. Everything seems to be go in the right direction up until February 2019. I lost my insurance coverage in February so I wasn't able to get the second or third steroid injection. Since February, untill present, my symptoms have progressed into both of my legs unable to show strength. I walk with a cane, a back brace, knee supports on each knee and soon, I'll probably need a walker. I cannot stand up unless there is something that I can grip and pull myself up with my upper body. For a normal person, these symptoms would probably be extreme enough to get in fear and see a doctor...yeah... I wish I was a normal person. \n\nI thought that maybe if I lost weight, my back wouldn't be so strained and eventually I will get my leg strength back. This week has made it apparent how poor health I have. I noticed that my feet, ankles and lower leg are starting to get swollen with fluid. It looks like i twisted my ankle or something. Don't worry about me not going to see a spine specialist. I have made up my mind on getting medical coverage and starting the path to recovery. I am just curious if anyone else has had bad disks that lead to weakened legs and maybe even had legs that swole up with fluid? And what was your path to recovery? How did doctors diagnose you and how much physical therapy did you need? \n\nThanks for reading this post and thanks for any help/information provided.  ", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Central US. No medically relevant history I\u2019m aware of. Only OTC meds. \n\nA few weeks/months ago (it\u2019s been long enough I don\u2019t recall the exact time it began) my eyelids became discolored and slightly dry. They were noticeably redder than the skin immediately around them and they hurt if I rubbed or stretched them to test the skin, but otherwise they didn\u2019t itch or hurt, just moderately reddened. I ignored it and figured it was a rash or irritation and would go away. When it lasted a few weeks I took note, but it\u2019s condition was the same.\n\nAfter a few weeks/month or two of that a patch appeared on my collarbone with the same symptoms - red skin, slightly smoother than normal in places while just dry and semi-scaly in others. No itching or pain unless I rubbed at it and otherwise fine. Since it was now in multiple places and could be spreading (although it had taken forever to do so) I began to worry, and saw a doctor. A friend had been diagnosed (and treated) for skin cancer, so I was a little on edge.\n\nDoctor was friendly but didn\u2019t communicate well - he looked at it for a few moments, heard my concerns, and prescribed an athletes foot cream without telling me specifically what he thought it was - I didn\u2019t even realize it was athletes foot cream until someone at the pharmacy helped me. I began to apply it twice daily as instructed but was told it might take some time to go away.\n\nFast forward a month, three bottles of two different antifungal creams, and a lot of stress later and I still have many of my symptoms. The patch on my shoulder is all but gone but patches on my eyes are stubbornly staying in place; meanwhile, new spots I suspect are the same thing have appeared on my wrist, the side of my hand, and my upper thigh. Even my shoulder still has a very small red dot.\n\nI\u2019m considering going back, showing them the new patches and results of treatment, but thought I\u2019d give this a shot before doing so, hoping that maybe this is something more common than I\u2019m aware of or that I\u2019m doing something wrong. \n\nA few last notes:\n\nI tried using moisturizing lotion prior to having my first doctors visit, thinking it was just dried skin. No change in appearance. \n\nIn an attempt to kill it faster I used a hydrogen peroxide application briefly, particularly on my shoulder. This caused a reaction after 2-3 days of raised and slightly painful red bumps which boiled white in further application of peroxide. This is not a normal reaction for me to hydrogen peroxide, but I\u2019ve also never used it for days at a time.\n\nShould I simply go to a dermatologist and get a more accurate fix? Return to the doctor and ask for a stronger oral treatment to hit my entire body at the same time? Was hoping for a better idea of what this is and why it continues to fade and then seems to come back, especially on my eyelids, despite continuing treatment consistently.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

So it could be something like mini-pneumonia that reduced oxygen travel to my head or something.\n\nSome other assorted symptoms, during the late afternoon and early night I sometimes been getting extreme tiredness and really have to fight against falling asleep. I've been waking up earlier than my alarm consistently which used to seldom happen. I get headaches every few days that last a couple minutes that feel like they come from inside my eyeballs. One time last week I saw what looked like a small worm in my stool, but couldn't get a good look because office toilets auto flush.\n\nAs for potentially related history, I got a blood test 5 months ago and it showed high cholesterol. I also have had what I believe to be costochondritis on my upper right side for the last 8 months. I am 24/M if that helps too.\n\nI'm not really sure how well all of this adds up, my best guess is something respiratory that would connect the dizziness and mucus.

I\u2019ve had this feelin for a long time now that I might have schizophrenia later in life because of the things that have happened.  I found an article that layed out all f the symptoms in teens (I am 16).  I found quite a few parallels.\n\nFirst, the article mentions reaching developmental milestones later during childhood, which DID happen as I think back.  I loved my mother for way too long (in fact, I actually remember that).  Usually, that kind of stuff is repressed as I learned in my psychology class.  Oh, and also, the castration fear came from my mother, not as much my dad because she told me she would nuterate me if she caught me looking at poem again.  That might have something to do with it.  All of that aside, I also took a while longer to get passed the egotistical stage and the latent stage lasted a really long time.\n\nThe article mentioned a decline in hygiene and happiness.  Both of which have happened.  I have an anxiety, only really when I talk with people.  I think I\u2019m social awkward.  I\u2019ll give an example: so today when I was walking the dog, a woman stopped me and asked if I was the guy who rides the unicycle.  She was talking about how much she admires my unicycling skills.  She asked me if I wanted or was training to be in the circus.  I said \u201cno ma\u2019am\u201d.  And the guy that was painting the mailbox right next to her laughed a bit.  I guess that came off weird.  So as I was coming back, and passed them again, she said something, I responded with something containing \u201cma\u2019am\u201d, and then the guy said \u201che called you \u201cma\u2019am\u201d.\u201d And she\u2019s like \u201cI know. I feel so old\u201d.  So that was funny.  I just moved along.  This is one reason why I\u2019m relinctant to go outside: you never know what people are thinking or what the philosophy behind their actions are or you don\u2019t even know what they know about themselves.\n\nI have a lot of inappropriate laughing and I think so strongly in my mind that I verbally talk out the rest I whatever I was thinking.\n\nMy friends call me \u201cNPC\u201d (non playable character), because in video games, they are programmed characters that only do a certain thing over and over again.  I asked \u201cwhy?\u201d And he said it\u2019s because I show no emotions when I talk.  And someone else told me that when I do laugh, my face changes lit so instantly.\n\nI do not get any delusions or hallucinations though.  There was this one time a little over a month or so ago when I was walking and all at once, it hit me like a bullet that the man near me was a child abductor, but I had good reason to believe such and I almost called the cops.  Turned out that he was his father.\n\nI see something on there about making and keeping friends is a difficulty, and perhaps that\u2019s true.\n\nSorry about not editing this post.

I'm waking up at the same time as I always do, but with massive bags under my eyes. I want to fall asleep in work, which I never get. And when I'm at the gym, I just don't have the energy. Also, I'm falling asleep at 9pm where I normally do at 11pm. \n\nJust wanted to check if hitting my head and this tiredness might be related - as it came out of nowhere really. \n\nOr am I just being paranoid. \n\nThanks!!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

That night, right before going to sleep around 11, I had begun to feel a dull/vague pain in my upper abdominal area, in the middle just below my rib cage.

I\u2019ve lost 50 pounds because im throwing up so much. Contacted my doctor but keep getting a replacement that just says I have the stomach flu even after more then 2 months. Went to the doctor that treated my Eds he was shocked and had make give blood to see if any vitamin values are if there is an infection and if my kidneys are ok. Still don\u2019t know what it could be.\n\nIt\u2019s been 2 months and 10 days since I started throwing up. At first I thought it was just my disease (eds type 3) which was causing this since it can affect your stomach. It started with me just feeling ill and throwing up. After 7 days I called my gp and he said he would swing by since it\u2019s hard for me to come there. The gp arrives but it was one of the other doctors in his clinic and I normally have no problem with that. He looks me over and says I\u2019m not dehydrated and everything looks like the stomach flu if things get worse or it is t over in a week we should call again. \n\nA week goes by we call the doctor and again this replacement and tell him the symptoms have evolved from just throwing up to everything tasting like chemicals or like metal and also any noise from a little burp or fart will set me of. The gp comes over at this point I\u2019m exhausted and haven\u2019t eaten in 6 days I could just get some sips of water in to take my pain meds. Again he says its still the stomach flu it can take a while. \n\nA couple of days later things start going south I cant even take my meds anymore and was completely dehydrated so i was taken to hospital given 4 iv bags and my medication. When I got home things got a little better and I could eat small things but would still get set of by weird tastes or noises. But mind you i live with a dad with acid reflux and a mom that just refuses to close the bathroom door next to my bed when she goes to the toilet so these noises cant be avoided.\n\nWe fast forward to now and me still throwing up everyday and I\u2019ve lost 50 pounds in 2 months and I\u2019ve noticed that my urine is getting really dark. The replacement gp still insists on treating me and when I called my own gp to tell him me and his replacement where not getting along whatsoever and I wanted a second opinion I got scolded at because he put so much time and effort in me. And yes I appreciate it but if he doesn\u2019t listen and will not help me then I need to speak to my own gp.

Still am and still do. A number of the listed symptoms (impulsivity, poor sense of time, difficulty paying attention/distractibility etc.) I recall having when I was little. My grades never suffered until around 8th grade I believe (year 9 for UK). I went from mostly As and some Bs, to mostly Bs and Cs. That's also when school started becoming more boring for me. I was getting a bit sick of school at this point too.\n* I am very sensitive and empathetic.\n* I have trouble controlling and not acting on my emotions.\n* My hearing is perfectly fine.\n* I never suffered any sort of trauma to the head.\n* I do show emotions on my face but sometimes I'm just sitting with a pokerface so when I am expected to react I find myself forcing an expression. Otherwise they would be confused. The expression is faked but not the emotion. I know it's technically still not really genuine in the sense that it's not my natural facial reaction.\n* Environments I tend to be in aren't very stimulating, i.e. low to medium-level noise, relatively little motion to a decent amount, etc..\n* I don't think I've ever experienced sensory overload before. I don't think there is any external stimulus that has precedence over anything else to me unless it's really fucking loud and/or obnoxious.\n* I struggled in school with memorizing facts and figures, but I was very good at learning and applying concepts. Also there was always *some* interest. It's just that my mind decided it had more interest things.. in mind.\n* I have very low self-esteem and social anxiety. I have been patronized and shunned by my peers throughout middle and high school. They thought I was weird, stupid, possibly mentally ill, etc..\n* I procrastinate so bad and perpetually hold things off. Lots of \"oh I'll do this first\"s.\n* When I'm totally relaxed I easily slip into \"the zone\".\n* I lack a set schedule.\n* I have goals but lack direction.\n* I live with my mom, dad, elder brother and younger sister.\n* I am a neurotic person however most of my symptoms occur even if I am not stressed.\n* My overactive brain gives me sleeping problems. I could be sleepy and my brain would be like \"No sleeping yet! More fun!\" until I'm drifting off. Or alternatively, my thoughts make me so anxious that I can't even get sleepy.\n* I love categorizing things. Like, listing a bunch of aquatic animals into categories and subcategories. It's embarrassing and I don't really do it anymore. In my opinion it is pointless and a waste of time, but it makes me so happy. So it isn't. But there are other things that can make me happy that provide more benefits.\n* I can be pretty messy. But I am super organized when I want to be. I am very good at organizing.\n\n\\----\n\nI apologize if any of the information I provide is irrelevant. I used my best judgement.

I also didn\u2019t have any severe diarrhea, but my poop does look a bit more watery. Occasionally I\u2019ll feel that my stomach is empty but the thought of eating my normal food puts me off.\n\nWhat I\u2019m worried about is that I did feel sad when the exchange students left so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what\u2019s causing all this or I\u2019m actually sick. I asked others who went to the party and they said they didn\u2019t feel sick or anything afterwards. Is it possible for someone to get the stomach flu and others don\u2019t when eating the same food?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I am generally able to understand and know well enough about the law and thus I do not have any criminal records. I was a good student at school, although I may not perform so well academically but overall my teachers say I am a polite and quiet student. I do not abuse animals. I am also currently diagnosed with ADHD and MDD.  I have ruled out the possibility of having Asperger because I don't meet most of the diagnostic criteria other than being \"socially awkward\". \n\nI personally suspect that I might be a psychopath because I seem to have a sort of...disconnection from other people. I don't care about others unless it has a direct impact on me, I make use of others to achieve my goals, I keep to myself during breaks unless someone pushed me into eating with others, I tell on others because I think it is the right thing to do (and because it feels exciting), I avoid responsibilities and don't perform well at work. \n\nOn the other hand, I guess I am able to feel fear. Fear about jaywalking on a busy road, get nervous when I have done something wrong and possibly about to get found out. I feel guilt to a limited degree - meaning unless someone calls me out on it, I do not feel guilt (or feel bad).  I don't display any narcissistic tendencies - I feel nothing about being about \"prestige\" or \"high-ranking people\" nor do I think of myself as superior to others. I can get suspicious about compliments (etc someone say I am smart...etc)  and I don't think I am charming either. \n\nThe key thing that made me question the possibility of me being a psychopath is my lack of connection to others. I have very very little concern about the needs of others. It is not \"me me me\" kind of thing, it is more like I do not care, nor do I force others to meet my needs/shower me with attention...etc. I do not really care when others tells me their problems and I feel super awkward and out of words whenever they do. \n\nI am open to more questions, and advice on how I can best manage my situation.

Those symptoms faded away once I calmed down and did some breathing exercises.\n\nAround the second week, I managed to contact a doctor that assured me there was nothing to worry about. As a blowjob with condom is quite safe. However, a part of me is still skeptical. The doctor mainly advised me to look out for symptoms such as painful urination and colored discharge from the penis. I did not experience any colored discharge but I had trouble urinating during the third week after the encounter. \n\nAt the time of writing, there is still no discharge. However, I still have a trouble urinating and even after urination, my bladder feels a little full. I also experience pain in the testicle region from time to time.

{"post_id": "b5rqgv", "created_utc": 1553617248, "title": "Various things going wrong and having trouble figuring out the cause(s)", "author": "ronin_cse", "self_text": "Hello! So long story short I have a few symptoms which may or may not be related and they seem to be general enough that they could relate to a few different disorders. I have been trying to figure out things with my doctor but I'm hoping that asking on here could get me a few ideas to talk to her about. Next appointment is this Thursday so I'm definitely actively talking my doctor as well. Just in case: I have some sexual performance related symptoms in case anyone doesn't want to read about that. Putting those in point 2 below.\n\nOk so background: I'm a 34 year old male type 1 diabetic currently using insulin injections, might switch to a pump soon. I'm 5'6\" and I was 140 lbs a couple days ago and my scale says I'm at 18% body fat. I'm white/Caucasian. I was misdiagnosed as a type 2 about 7 years ago and I just found out I was type 1 late last year. That being the case I was not well controlled for most of those 6 years of thinking I was a type 2 and my A1C was generally in the 10s and high 9s. I am doing much better now and my last A1C, after being on insulin for just about a month was down to a 7.7, next A1C is due next month. Typically I am around 120 and after eating I tend to keep the spike under 200. Sometimes I go low but I typically don't go below 70 as I typically notice it around 80. I am aware that some of the following issues are probably at least related to my poor blood sugar over those years but it's just so hard to tell. I still have feeling in my hands and feet and they don't really tingle so if I have started with the neuropathy in those areas it is early enough that I don't notice yet. Last eye exam was less than a year ago and nothing wrong there. Currently taking Atorvastatin, omeprazole, 22 units of long acting levemir insulin, and humalog rapid acting insulin as needed (ratio is 1 per 7.5 carbs, typically taking about 20-30 units a day). I have been taking E and B12 vitamin supplements as well.\n\nSo over the last year at least I have noticed the following symptoms, I may have experienced some earlier than last year but if I did it wasn't severe enough for me to notice it: \n\n1. I have been getting chills throughout the day for no reason, I don't believe this is just becoming more sensitive to cold as I actually seem to not have this happen when exposed to cold weather (like no issues walking around outside this year while it was below zero) and it tends to happen more often when I am at home in a warm room in the 70-74 degree range. It seems to happen around 4 - 5 pm more often but that isn't consistent. The sensation could last an hour or it rarely last most of the day. Sometimes I feel perfectly fine, like right now. Sometimes it seems to be stress induced as, for example, I notice it happening while getting ready for a date or some other social function that I am nervous about, I also tend to start getting ready for those things around 5 pm so maybe it is just that too. Sometimes it feels like when I come out of this my body goes too far and I start sweating. I have typically sweated a bit more than average so could just be normal body reaction. If do something that gets me warm like working out or taking a bath while this is going on I typically feel fine afterwards.\n2. I have been suffering from ED (erectile dysfunction) and PE (premature ejaculation) lately. The ED could very well be related to the diabetes. I have been single for about a year and before that my wife and I weren't all that active for the previous year so everything related to this is without a partner. Without using meds I am able to get somewhat of an erection most of the time, and with sildenafil it works every time and is mostly a full erection. In either case once I orgasm it goes away almost immediately which is much faster than it used to. Like I said sounds like a sadly common side effect of the diabetes but listing it just in case. What is more worrying to me is the PE as I haven't seen much that links that to diabetes. Basically I am ready to orgasm as soon as I get erect. If I stop and start at that point it doesn't really help even if a stop for a minute or two. When I do ejaculate most of the time it's fine but sometimes I feel like my muscles aren't working fully and I don't get it all out. This has never been an issue for me my whole life and it's really weird that I went from being able to last mostly as long as I wanted to not being able to last any time at all.\n3. My heart rate has been fairly rapid lately. Right this minute just sitting here according to my Apple Watch (which I know isn't THAT accurate) it's at 106. When I went to my last Dr. appointment (last Thursday) it was at 120 when they checked it, that was after having a coffee and I get nervous seeing the Dr though. I typically seem to have a heart rate of 80 - 110 while just sitting and not doing anything stressful (again just according to my watch). When I exercise it typically maxes out at 180 and hits 160 pretty quick.\n4. It seems like it has been a little more difficult to urinate lately and sometimes I have to stop then start again. I have also been defecating more than usual sometimes going 2 or 3 times in a day, this has been an off and on thing over the last couple months. I have also been trying to eat healthier and add more fiber to my diet so it could be from this. Normal stool and not diarrhea.\n5. I have been having trouble sleeping. Sometimes it is hard for me to fall asleep but typically what happens is I wake up in the middle of the night and then can't fall asleep. I feel like this is more stress related as it is usually because my mind starts working itself up but could be related to something else.\n6. Just in general I feel tired and that I fatigue easily. Those things are so general though I don't know if they add much. I haven't been sleeping well so is probably why I am tired and probably why I fatigue easily. I have also been getting over a cold for the last month or so which again probably contributes to the fatigue.\n\nWell the rules say be detailed! If anything needs more clarification I would be happy to add more. I have been exercising a lot more over the last year and besides the above issues and the type 1 I feel like I'm in the best health of my life.\n\nI had a dr visit last week and we got a bunch of blood test done. Based on these symptoms I was worried of a thyroid condition or I guess anemia (no family history of that though). My mom just found out she has hypothyroidism due to an autoimmune issue and that also seems more common with type-1 people as well. So had those tests done and my TSH is at a 2.54 and my Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies are at 44.6, so doesn't seem like I am hypo or hyper there. We also did a blood count test and all those results are normal. We pretty much did the works and ALL my results are normal. My triglycerides are a little bit high (177) but that's it. She ordered some inflammation tests as well which again are all normal.\n\nJust based on my layman web searching I guess I have a couple ideas. Something up with my prostate, enlarged or BPH. Of course it's easy to go to the worst case and think cancer right away but trying not to think that yet. I have no blood in my urine or semen. I will be asking to run a PSA test and will go from there. The ED wasn't sudden and happened long before more difficult to urinate thing and PE isn't listed on any symptom lists I have seen. Also wouldn't explain the heart rate and chills. This could all possibly be mental as well. A lot of these things could probably indicated general anxiety disorder and the chills could be a misguided flight or fight reflex. Been going back to school, job can be stressful sometimes, and somewhat recently divorced and in general not sure what I want to do with my life so I think my stress level may be higher than normal. I was on anti-depressants for about 5 years but I got off them around April last year as I was worried they were causing my ED and I didn't feel like they were working anymore. Maybe I should try them again but I also don't want to just try and fix everything with a pill. I don't FEEL like I am depressed lately but who knows. Not seeing a therapist right now but definitely considering seeing one again.\n\nIf anyone has any other ideas that I can bounce off of my doctor that would be amazing! I trust my doctor but even the best are only human and can't think of everything so I'm hoping the Reddit hive mind can come up with something I can bounce off her. Reddit is actually what helped me finally get the testing done to find out I was type-1 and not type-2 actually so here's hoping for some more magic.\n\nThank you SO much for reading all this!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I am very active physically and mentally. Since June 14th 2018 onwards I had not been sleeping enough (around 5 hours), ate food at 10am, 12pm and then directly at 8pm. After work, I would go to play badminton without any food and sometimes gym as well. A lot of exercises you see. One day suddenly on June 25th after coming back from an intense gym routine, I started feeling shortness of breath and my hands and legs started to tingle. I immediately called 911 and was taken to the hospital. They did **ECG**, **echo**, **blood test**, **chest x-ray, MRI, CT angiography**, **CT scan abdomen**, **thyroid test**, **ultrasound abdomen**, **pulmonary function test** and said I was low on electrolytes and had high lactic acid buildup and rest every test was normal. They gave me some electrolytes and something else for the lactic acid build up and discharged me the next day. After being discharged that day, from June 25 to Aug 8, I've been to the emergency 3 other times. All these other times I've had similar complaints of shortness of breath. They thought it's anxiety.\n\nThe cardiologist did a **stress test** as well and said there's nothing wrong with my heart. Fast forward to around September 2018, I don't think its a heart issue as I am able to run for miles or play badminton for hours.\n\nFrom September 2018 onwards though, I have been having flat stools consistently along with chest tightness and excessive burping. so I went to the gastroenterologist and got a **colonoscopy** **with biopsy** and an **endoscopy** **without biopsy** done. The results for **colonoscopy** were negative indicating only mild hemorrhoids. The results for **endoscopy** said I had very tiny gastric erosions.\n\nHowever, since September 2018, I have not been feeling well. On a lot of days, I feel feverish (although when I check the thermometer, there's no fever), extremely fatigued the whole day and nauseous as well. The flat stools are still there but chest tightness and burping has reduced. I am tired of feeling sick all the time!\n\nI've thought whether it could be cancer but because of various factors and the tests, but every doctor I've spoken to has ruled out cancer. What else could it be that is causing this? It's making me miserable.\n\nI had my vitamin D and B12 levels checked in November and although they were sightly low, they were not too low.\n\nI have been consuming around 2-3 Litres of water along with a salad almost everyday since Feb 2019. I have also been monitoring my weight since July 2018 and its been almost constant.\n\nIf anyone could have any insights, it would be very very helpful! Thanks!

That post can be seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/9nlp4e/please_help_these_are_several_chronic_symptoms/) if interested. I go into more detail of some of my symptoms there. But since then I've had two blood tests taken and seen a primary care physician with some things ruled out (probably), but not much closer to knowing exactly what's going on. \n\nFirst I'll just list my symptoms, some I forgot to include in my original post:\n\n* **cold hands and feet**, almost all the time unless I'm just constantly moving (my whole life but has gotten worse)\n* **paleness/pallor**, all the time unless i can really push to get my blood flowing, takes a lot of effort and doesn't last\n* **vitiligo**, a total of 4 spots appeared on my head when i was a teenage and it hasn't spread since then\n* **facial redness**, looks sort of like the butterfly rash seen in lupus, but looks more like rosacea perhaps, dry white flakes appear if i don't use moisturizer every day\n* **leg hair loss**,  anterolateral leg alopecia, started outside of calves, has now started to spread to entire leg, including thighs\n* **very low libido**\n* **fatigue**, seem to need 10+ hours of sleep at least and still feel tired upon waking\n* **exercise intolerance**\n* **minor joint pain**, minor pain in knees, toes, and neck/shoulders that comes and goes. Usually doesn't last more than a day\n* **fainting**: 2 episodes, several episodes of almost fainting\n* **depression/anhedonia** \n* **brain fog**, at times extreme\n* **cognitive symptoms**: memory loss, ability to spell greatly reduced, pronunciation is worse (especially 2nd languages which I speak daily), starting to get concerned about my driving ability as it seems to be declining as well, sense of direction has become bad, hand coordination seems to be off, fumbling with keys and such\n* **low resting HR**, average resting heart rate is around 53 bpm (from Apple Watch). In and of itself probably not a concern, but perhaps relevant in context. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, a lot of these symptoms seem to lessen and worsen in severity on a very quick cycle. Sometimes even just day to day, but more often I'll have a good week or so and then a bad week or so, but the bad days are becoming more frequent and the severity is gradually increasing. For example, my 2nd language pronunciation accuracy will be dramatically different from one day to the next sometimes, it's quite noticeable. \n\n**The following have been tested**: TSH, T3, T4, Testosterone, DHEA-S, hs-CRP, Ferritin, Prolactin, Vitamin D, B12, CBC w/ differential, GFR, CMP. \n\nAll of these came back within the normal reference ranges, seemingly ruling out hypothyroidism and low testosterone, except these seemingly minor abnormalities:\n\n**LOW white blood cell count**: 4.4  (ref. range 4.6-10.2)\n\n**HIGH Red Cell Distribution Width**: 15.0 (ref. range 11.0-14.8)\n\nThe doctor I saw was annoyed (he literally said as much) that the tests didn't come back showing hypothyroidism and basically threw his hands up, diagnosed me with depression and prescribed an SSRI, which I'm not at all interested in taking. Was a very frustrating experience and I'm looking for a new primary care physician. \n\nOn my own I've tried seeing if different foods trigger these symptoms and it seems like that could be a possibility but I have no idea what they might be, despite trying hard to figure it out. I bought a glucose monitor and checked that regularly for a few weeks and my glucose seems to be normal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm really at a loss for what could be going on.

I was told I experience \"hypo-hypo-mania\", induced by my anxiety--so not even qualifying of a cyclothymia diagnosis. The psychologist hardly spoke with me and the people he interviewed truly don't know me well or understand my behavior as I have vast self-control and had successfully hidden my behavior from 11 to 16 (and would still be hiding it if I didn't break down; I'm 18 now and was evaluated at 17, though I still hid my behavior...I just talked about it but not very well). I've recently gone on Zoloft and have been feeling rather restless, hyper, and, initially, euphoric. I wrote this thread a few days ago for r/zoloft: \"I have an enormous amount of energy...like profoundly enormous. All I want to do is run and run and run and never stop. I also can't stop singing. I'm moving really quickly and doing parkour shit in the house and throwing stuff around and juggling things. My body feels great now and it had been feeling horrible beforehand. I have an incredible amount of mental energy...it feels like my head is vibrating and my body too. My thoughts have been racing a lot the past few days as well...they're going so fast it feels horrible. My psychiatrist told me to watch for mania because it's been a concern in the past but a psychological evaluation ruled it out apparently and attributed my mania symptoms to anxiety. It doesn't actually feel that great because I can't get anything done as I can't focus and my head feels really strange but other than that I'm pretty euphoric.\" I used to get these episodes rather frequently about two years ago, but they morphed into mostly feeling like absolute shit mixed with being restless (like holy shit level restless), hyper, jumping out of my skin, agitated, and angry. Those episodes occur seemingly randomly as far as I can tell...they don't require a stressor. They're quite torturous and have made me plan suicide and they seem to last days to weeks. I literally just lie on the floor with my hands on my head while rocking at my worst...on those days that often lasts for at least 7-8 hours of me just lying on the floor. There was a day a few months ago where I paced for 12 hours straight in the hallway, contemplating suicide, and wanting to rip my skin off. I sometimes feel calm and normalish but it doesn't occur frequently or for very long. The last longest period of calm I had was in December for about 8-10 days, though each month is interspersed with a few days of true calm generally. I often have the torturous version of episodes regardless of whether or not I'm anxious. I really don't understand how my current diagnosis makes sense. I'm honestly not sure the psychologist who tested me even knew about my episodes at the time because he didn't really talk with me much and no one witnessed them unhinged and neither my therapist or my psychiatrist mentioned them (what they told me because they were questioning the diagnosis too in another way [thought disorder because I couldn't let go of my \"anxious thoughts\" so they thought I was delusional even though I flat out said I knew they weren't true, but I assume I projected my restlessness and it expressed as \"anxiety\"]). I didn't tell the psychologist much about the episodes because I had figured I didn't have bipolar disorder. I initially broke down because I was oscillating between depression and that euphoria state I got from Zoloft (very quick and back to back oscillations, each lasting days), but those stopped and I started getting an agitated depression sort of thing which I figured wasn't bipolar and I figured I was basically delusional before so I didn't emphasize that to him and no one else did so he didn't even know as far as I can tell. Thank you for anything you can add. I really want this torture to end so I can finally experience life, but I'm not sure my current route on Zoloft is the right one so I do feel quite hopeless. I want to have a positive end in sight. The only other medications I've tried are hydroxyzine and buspirone, both to no avail. Any advice? I should say I'm already in the process of contacting my psychiatrist about this.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I get sweaty palms, my heart rate increases, I start to breathe heavily and I start to feel faint. So it's more of a psychological thing. I get panicked by the idea of me fainting, which makes me more faint, which makes me more panicked,which makes me even more faint and raises my heart rate and so on. I always have to fight and break out of this cycle, which is not easy because it occurs in situations where I can't move, as mentioned earlier.\n\nI have never actually fainted from these situations but I get really close sometimes. If there is something that can distract my attention from thinking about it, this thing stops. One thing that helps me is extremely minty chewing gum, as it refreshes me and gets me out of that fainting state.\n\nDoes anyone know what I could do to control myself better in these situations?

It would go on for around two minutes, go away for an hour or so, then come back. I had a similar issue back once in december, but it was only one spell. After two days, I went to see my doctor, who diagnosed me with vocal cord disorder, as a result of anxiety. The thing is, I\u2019m an anxious person, but I\u2019ve actually been more stress-free this past month than I have been in a while. I accepted that, and tried to ignore it for a while. It started happening less frequently, maybe once a day, and I\u2019m concerned because it hasn\u2019t gone away in a month. It could be feeding off of itself, since I do worry about this condition, but I\u2019m not sure. Anytime I think I\u2019ve found a pattern, some spell contradicts it. For example, I think it happens more when I lay down to asleep, but it does happen randomly during the day sometimes. Also, the numbness has recently been only in my throat area, and not in my chest.\n\n\nTL;DR: Resistance when breathing accompanied but slight numbnes in my throat area without tingling, comes and goes in spells, not on any medication, no family history of heart disease or anything major like that. Doctor says it\u2019s anxiety, but it\u2019s been a month since then. I\u2019m aware that my body is capable of feeding off of my own anxiety to create symptoms that don\u2019t exist, and it does tend to happen more when I have nothing to distract me, but it\u2019s never consistent.

I went to an allergist and they couldn't find anything I was allergic to and told me to try benadryll which didn't help at all. Alcohol is the worst thing for me, awful odor and symptoms.
