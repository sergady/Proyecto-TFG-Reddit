Often, it occurs while sitting and will persist throughout the day. However, on unoccasional days, I may not have any stiffness. The stiffness can be temporarily relieved by laying down or cracking my back.\n\n**Health History**\n\nAbout 5 years ago, in 8th grade, my jaw became locked and eventually popped its way open. I noticed my lips are uneven now, and believe it was because my jaw popped into the incorrect position. Also, my jaw makes a clicking/popping sound whenever I open it. I believe the reason for my jaw locking may be due to wisdom teeth eruption. I'm getting my 4 wisdom teeth removed soon.\n\nAnother thing is that I can't wear tight pants or underwear anymore. Back in 6-8th grade, I was able to wear my gym shorts under my school pants, but starting in 9th grade I was no longer able to do that. Whenever, I did, I would have intense stomach pain, shortness of breath, the urge to defecate, and I would be incredibly gassy. The only way I could relieve these problems were to remove and not wear my gym pants under my school pants. Currently, I can't even wear underwear either because it would cause the same problems.\n\n**Etc**\n\nI use to play padless football a couple times during Physical Education in middle-high school and have been roughly tackled several times.\n\n\n**Summary of problem &amp; conditions/symptoms**\n\n \nStiffness in neck/lower back\n\n- often occurs while sitting and will persist throughout the day\n\n- causes me to have shallow breaths &amp; makes it slightly hard to breathe\n\n- have to crack lower back for temporary relief\n     * feel lower back \"stuck/fused\" need to crack back to feel \"unstuck\"\n\n     * sometimes can apply pressure in palm/feet/etc to crack back\n\n     * after cracking back, i will get a breath of fresh air like i just put a peppermint in my mouth and \nimmediately took a sip of cold water\n\n- laying down also gives me temporary relief\n\n\nIrritable Bowel Syndrome?\n\n- become gassy and sometimes get the urge to defecate whenever I wear anything tight on my waist\n\n- can't drink a lot of milk or I get diarrhea (as a child I was not lactose intolerant)\n\n\nTMJ\n\n- about 5 yrs ago, my jaw became locked i believe it may be due to wisdom teeth eruption\n\n- eventually my jaw popped into position while i was eating, but i could only open my mouth about 2 fingers wide\n\n- on different occasions, while eating, my jaw would make a loud popping that would make me jump. now i could open my mouth wider than 2 fingers. this loud kind of pop doesn't happen anymore.\n\n- currently, my lips are uneven, so i assume my jaw popped into the wrong position\n\n- currently, when opening my mouth, my jaw makes a small clicking/popping sound\n\n- currently, when opening my mouth, my jaw moves to the right then left before my mouth fully opens\n\nBones are crackable\n\n- lower back\n\n- shoulders\n\n- knees\n\n- toes\n\nTwo vertical greyish/black lines on my left thumb\n\n- occurred about 3 years ago and still present\n\n- https://imgur.com/a/v9g9SKG", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

She's always had trouble remembering words she wants to use every once and a while. She knows what she's trying to say, she just forgets the word (ie she calls things \"the whatchamacallit\" and things like that). A possibly related problem she has is that she often confuses left and right. The thing is, SHE DOES KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LEFT AND RIGHT. She'll just be thinking \"left\", but say right. She's not at all confused about the concept, she just uses the wrong word. Obviously, I'm a little concerned as she's caused several near accidents due to her accidentally using the wrong word when giving my dad directions in the car. I've tried googling but, alas, to no avail. Does anyone here have an idea of what the issue could be? I'd really appreciate it if you do. By the way, one small note that might help: she's definitely not dyslexic, as this only effects her when she's speaking, not when she's writing or reading, and it's definitely not due to an injury as I (26, M, USA) have the same problems remembering words occasionally (though not as often as her).

I've been to my primary care physician a few times and we've tried Prednisone, other antiinflammatories, and switching antihistamines with little benefit. I was finally referred to an ENT a month ago and he did a complete workup on me. He cleaned a bit of wax off my right ear drum and had me add Astelin to my daily regimen. He also asked me to get a CT scan with and without contrast, which I haven't done yet. Within a few days of starting the Astelin, my dizziness and fullness/popping in my right ear improved significantly. I haven't had any more issues over the past few weeks,\n\nUntil yesterday, when all of a sudden my dizziness and ear issue returned. It lingered for a few hours and is now better again. Still, I want to get to the bottom of what's going on with me. A CT scan is going to cost me $500 out of pocket with my current insurance, and I'm coming off a divorce that has left me financially devastated, so I really don't want a big medical bill if I can avoid it. But I also want to be smart and not take any risks with my health.\n\nI'm seeking advice on what could possibly be going on with me and whether I should go forward with the CT. I made an appointment for next Tuesday with a local radiology clinic, but now that the issues I experienced again yesterday have subsided I'm wondering if I should cancel.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I am 178 cm high, weigh about 65kg and I am from Denmark.Since July last year, I have had back pain. It came when I was at a festival and was very intense. I tried almost everything I could try, but nothing seemed to work, most of the treatments worked the first 2 or 3 times and then the effectiveness drastically fell. About 2 months ago I vomited a bit of blood and was therefore submitted to the local hospital. They tested my blood and asked me about a bunch of different questions. It turned out I might have had a stomach ulcer because I drank a lot at the festival combined with an overuse of paracetamol, to dull the pain from my back. Before my back pain, I was very reluctant to take any kind of pills, but this time it hurt so bad I just had to mitigate it with something. So I took a fair bit of ibuprofen. The hospital gave me some Pantoprazole 40mg and told me to take 2 pills a day. As a result of the pills, the back pain went completely away. 1 month later my doctor told me to stop taking the pills slowly, so I went down to 1 pill a day and there was no problem. About 2 weeks ago I went down to half a pill every other day, and the problems started. I have been on the pills for a long time, and my stomach ulcer was not bleeding, so it should have healed by now,  but the back pain has slowly returned and is almost completely back again. I don't know what to do now, but at least I know the pills helps my back pain, anyone who has the slightest idea what it can be? and what I should do?

The episodes appear about 7 hours after eating, and they last for about 4 to 5 hours. I usually eat a balanced and rather healthy diet, but around the time this started, I went on vacation with my husband and we ate all kinds of really fatty foods, stuff that I haven't put in my body in a long time. I have been swinging between having diarrhea and being constipated.\n\nThe area where it hurts is somewhat tender to the touch, but the real pain happens when I breathe anything but the most shallow breaths.

I know that I will probably need to go to the doctor for this, but I have severe social anxiety and I get terrible panic attacks. Before I go, I want to do some research on what this might be.

I'll suddenly be paralyzed. I'll become paralyzed over the course of a few seconds to perhaps 20 seconds. I can stay paralyzed for as little as 10 minutes. I can have a seizure every 60 days. I can have seizures as long as 6 hours. I can have seizures as many times as 10 a day. I can have over 10 hours of seizures in total in one day. The more energy I have used over the last 3 months seems to affect both the quantity and quality of my seizures, increasing the number of seizures and the length of them.\n\n\n1. \nI may be doing a task like making food with a kitchen tool in my hand. Suddenly I'm not quite able to use the tool and am slightly confused at first. Then I realize I don't feel my grip anymore and realize it is because my seizure or paralyzis is coming into effect. That is when I drop the kitchen tool and fall over paralyzed on the kitchen floor for probably the next 2 hours. I am fully aware and conscious while this goes on, but despite feeling my entire body, I cannot move anything. If I attempt to hold my breath, I will shortly after automatically start breathing again.  It's as if I've lost control of my body entirely. \n\n\n\n2. \nPart 1. I'm playing games or watching a movie and start to feel like my head isn't where it should be. Joy disappears and whatever I'm enjoying myself with feels monotone and bland. I get a strong urge to go to bed and just lie to rest for a few minutes to a few hours. This can be 10 minutes to 4 hours of just resting, trying to regain that energy and focus that has been lost.\n\n\n2. \nPart 2. If I keep playing games or watching that movie, I'll eventually no longer be able to move as my seizure has begun. I'll likely slide out of my chair and up on the floor again. If I am lucky however I can sense the seizure at least 10 seconds ahead of time and may be able to reach my bed so I can have the seizure there. Luckily my bed is just an arm's length from my chair. \n\n\n\nI've had blood tests, physical exams, brain scans, nerve tests and sleep tests done to try to diagnose these symptoms, but nothing has come up.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Goosebumps, wakes me up sometimes...yeah.\n\nOrange areas are just here and there.\n\nPain feels a little better if I bring my knee up to my chest.  Heat feels good but doesn't kill the pain, Tylenol takes the edge off.  I can't take NSAIDs so that's out.\n\n\nMoi:\n\n- Female, early 30s, 5'10\", overweight\n- Gallbladder removed 2 years ago, no complications\n- Endometriosis (lap in 2009, Dx stage 3)\n- PCOS\n- No confirmed IBS, but have had a lifetime of mixed symptoms\n\n\nLengthy Background:\n\nHad Mirena IUD inserted by OBGYN on July 24, 2018.  OBGYN stated it was my best option for keeping Endo growth at bay.  A week later I was at my wits end with the back pain and stiffness.  Having heard of the nightmare that is migration, I went to emergency to see if it had moved.  Nope - x-ray showed I was full up.  Totally full of stool, despite having gone daily (I guess I was going \"around\" the back up)...  I started taking PEG daily per doctors advice.  Didn't seem to help.  Drank more water, moved more, began using suppositories or Ducolax out of desperation (only when it was truly desperate).  Stool came out little by little, and I did what I could with fibre/water/exercise to manage it.\n\nMid-February, the pain started.  So sore, only felt relief when my knee was close to my chest.  My stool started becoming alarmingly thin (pencil/straw) 70% of the time, loose 20%, and dime to nickel diameter 10% of the time.\n\nSaw doctor, told to keep doing what I was doing.  Probably  just constipated.\n\nCalled OBGYN's nurse line, told they'd move my appointment up but to go to emerg if pain continued.  I felt it could be endometriosis as that's where my pain was when it was first discovered.\n\nWent to emerg again; urine and blood fine, intravaginal and external ultrasounds didn't show anything.  Vaginal swabs showed nothing.\n\nHad OBGYN appointment, showed \"poop journal\", pointed to pain areas.  OBGYN did exam, palpated.  Said he didn't feel it was endometriosis, told me to keep doing what I was doing - move even more, drink even more water, up my fiber...the same stuff.  Didn't seem concerned despite the obvious frustration.  Said hormones in IUD are naturally constipating.\n\nA week later I broke down at work. I'd spent the day with my foot up on a box, trying to manage pain and be at my desk.  Occasionally going to the bathroom to pass pencil thin stool while sweating profusely.  Went to a walk-in clinic; doc asked what I wanted him to do...  Told him I needed it to stop.  He gave me an Rx for Bentyl and sent me for a 1 image x-ray of my pelvis.  Nothing found.\n\nBentyl was 1x a day, and seemed to help.  Stool became nickel size diameter - round or sort of squished into an oval shape.  But it was coming out!  Pain still there, but less pressure in the abdomen DID help a bit.  Took it for two months and then ran out; within 4 days I was stopped up and in agony.\n\nSaw doctor, got another Rx for Bentyl.  Took it 2x a day.  Diarrhea, but still in pain.  Dropped down to 1x a day after a week to stop the diarrhea, especially where it wasn't helpful with the pain.  Pelvic x-ray (front - no side imaging) didn't come up with anything.\n\n\nNow I can't seem to pass stool except with a huge amount of effort, or if my body suddenly cooperates.  Sometimes it's almost like the sphincter won't release it....??  Gas gets trapped and wont pass sometimes, but other times it's fine.  \n\nOn the weekend I passed one straight long piece (3-4 on Bristol) of \"normal\" to \"wide\" size.  Like I had a rocket behind it - boom, out.  Barely any wiping.  Pain didn't dissipate at all though...frig sakes.  If anything it spread for the next half hour...probably from the emptying?  Anywhoo - it goes to show that the pipe is still indeed a pipe, but not sure what the hell happened.  I was SHOCKED, after so many months of tiny little wussy BMs.\n\nWithin 2 days of that I'm back to not being able to pass anything without strategic pushing, while on tiptoes (stool seems to be too high).\n\nThis whole time I've been telling these medical professionals that it feels like I have a brick in my pelvis, mind you.  The pain only subsides a little bit when my knee is at my chest - almost like I've had a cyst burst, but continuously for 4 months.\n\nI'm HURTING, and none of these medical folks seem to be on board for solving it.\n\n\nThings I've found and have considered:\n\n- \"hidden\" hernia (several examples out there of women having unseen hernias)?\n- rectocele or similar (I DO feel bulging towards my perineum and vaginal wall if I feel while bearing down, and my perineum aches after going/trying to go)?\n- diverticulitis?\n- sigmoid/rectum partial blockage?\n- nerve damage from the months of constipation issues?\n- anal stricture or PF dysfunction which is hanging on to my waste?\n\n\nWhat the actual hell am I possibly dealing with here?  I'm going to continue going back to physicians and I am being as realistic as I can - remembering I'm NOT a medical professional (ie: not going to the WebMD/forum OMGCANCER conclusion) - but dang it, I'd love some thoughts, suggestions, and advice on this.\n\nI want:\n\n1) the pain to stop\n2) my pooper to work \"normally\" again\n\nI see my OBGYN on the 18th; I told his nurse that I either want a dang scope or the IUD out.  Or both.  Dear sweet baby Jesus I hope something happens.  I'm losing my mind.\n\n\nValue your pooper, peeps.  I value any thoughts/feedback/ideas/suggestions.

I feel like a 60-year-old and I've been performing poorly in school this last year. Based on the research I've done my testosterone levels seem super low for a healthy 21 year old who has been working out consistently for 5 years and most of the symptoms of low T seem to apply to me. TRT is not something I want to be dealing with at 21 unless its absolutely necessary because the side effects and complications have to be weighed out. And I'd like to get to the root cause of this and treat it rather than masking the symptoms.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

When I lift my head all the way up/back, it gets noticeably tighter and I begin to cough when breathing. I feel like there is *something* in my throat blocking it.\n\nI wouldn't care because I can always breath fine, however...\n\n**Most annoying**: My speech becomes very tense. It feels like it is 10x more difficult to speak. My **vocal cords** become tense. It seems like someone grabbed them and when I speak I am fighting against that force. \n\nThe tension + a tiny bit of nervousness =&gt; I begin to stutter (I know stuttering is a mental problem, and it partially is, but in my case, it is only 10% mental and 90% physical). \n\nThe main concern for me is not the breathing, but not having a solid speech with relaxed/clean/clear vocal cords.\n\nWhat I noticed affects my speech: \n\n* Clogged nose with mucus (even slightly) makes my vocal cords **very tense** (I am guessing the nasal drip) \n\n* Lack of sleep or tiredness makes my vocal cords **tense** \n\n* *Strangely*: ejaculating (from masturbation/sex) often (more than 3 times per week) makes my vocal cords **unsolid/tense** and my speech becomes worse (this is a very strange phenomenon I haven't found any explanation to). Ejaculating once per week or 2 weeks, keeps my speech very solid. \n\nI specifically didn't label this as a \"stuttering help\" question because I would get speaking tips for a more fluent speech, I already read tons of those. What I need, is help to solve my **PHYSICAL problem**, which is the tense vocal cords.\n\nOnly once (out of many visits to the doctor for different reasons), a doctor listened to me breath, and gave me an asthma puffer. A week later, a different doctor listened to me breath again, and said that the previous doctor was wrong and 100% I don't have asthma.

I have been looking at some [vocal cords drop for singers](https://www.amazon.com/TMRG-Classic-Professional-Natural-Supplement/dp/B00DZJ8Z6Y), or gurgling my throat with Listerine, I wonder if something like that will help, or if anyone has better suggestions?\n\n3. Can you suggest any exercises/stretches to clear the throat and strengthen vocal cords that would fit my case?\n\n4. What is the medical term for the case I described above?

I saw my GP that day and received antibiotic eye drops. About 4 days later I had made minimal progress as it was still red, swollen, and pussing... so I went back to the GP. He said it should look a lot better by now, so he referred me to an Optometrist. Was able to see him that day, and he gave me a full eye examination. My sight was good, no blurriness or double vision. He figured it was a nasty bacterial infection and that it would take something a little stronger to make it go away. He prescribed me Tobradex which is a steroid eye drop for 4 drops a day. After 2-3 days of Tobradex, my eye got better enough to go back to work, but progress has plateaued since initially starting Tobradex. The redness had subsided soon after starting Tobradex, but the eyelid swelling has lingered since.

I had a prostate infection last year that took a very long time to get better due to my body's insane immune reaction that caused lingering inflammation for months.\n\nTLDR: Got pink eye in right eye, got steroid drops, went away but left behind a lazy eye/swollen eyelids in the one eye.

Especially regarding bone disorders - osteoartritis, spinal stenosis etc.\n\n\nMy  story.\nVery physicaly active childhood, sports, weigtlifting etc.\n\nPreexisting conditions/injuries\n\na - flat foot\n\nb - no natural curvature in lower spine - flat back\n\nc - hip inpingement from childhood - FAI\n\nd - 3 metre fall on upper back, which started my pain story. 5 years ago, when I was 22\n\nIn short - a,b,c have played some part in my spinal/hip/knee osteoartritis. I played a lot of basketball/volleyball and my body just isnt built to absorb impact I guess. A,b,c my have caused my spine/knees/hips to degenerate faster than they should.\n\n5 years ago fell on my upper back. Stopped lifting due to pain, started running/bodyweight training.\n\n6 months later hips and elbows started to hurt. \nDid MRI for back/hips/knees - all show osteoarthritis in spine, hips, knee, elbow, right wrist  and tendinopathy in my elbows/achilles/hamstring etc.\n\nStopped all activities.\nFor last 4 years have been on/off physical therapy.\nIt is HARD to motivate myself, because physical therapy makes by back hurt MORE after exercise.\n\nHips/knees hurt LESS after physical therapy - go figure.\n\nLong story short - I am suicidal - hips/knees/elbows DONT bother me as much, its the f****** BACK. If I lay in bed all day it hurts less, then if I try to stay active/mobile.\n\nBack pain has destroyed my libido, taken my job from me, relationships and my joy. Not to mention I have almost no close family... - my mother died young, an alcoholic, my father didnt raise me,  but we are decent with communication, not friends, but I guess OK.\nMy grandparents, who raised me, are nearing their death and they are the only ones keeping me alive right now.\n\nI could never  hurt them by taking my life before them, taking into account they have already lost their daughter - my mom.\n\nMy vertebrae havent fused yet and I dont have stenosis, but I guess they are very likely in the future.\n\nMy question is,  - and this is  the only thing that gives me hope - can I look forward to technology to save me from pain in future?\n\nI mean - if I was told that I will have this pain forever, and exercise wont help, I would just wait for my grandparents to pass away and either off myself or use euthanasia clinic offer - I am sure I qualify.\n\nThe possibility of cure in future and spending at least a few active years without pain - that would be amazing and would motivate me to endure the pain.\nOther thing would be having children - but taking into account my current state, it would be extremely immoral to have a child just to have a reason to live..\n\nI apologize for my badly strucutred text and if my English wasnt perfect, it is not my native language.

I can palpate my abdomin fairly freely, I can bend around and do work. I haven't been particularly fatigued, no fever that I've detected, no real loss of appetite. The only other thing of mild note is I have some sort of abrasion or pimple inside my belly button, I'm treating it by keeping it clean and applying antiseptic salve. Almost no perceivable pain at the site though. I've had some small bowel movements, they seem to be free of blood and aren't particularly abnormal, just small. I've tried sennoside laxatives (15mg, tried double dose at least one night) and a glicerin suppository and both have no and very little effect, respectively. \n\nI've somewhat changed my diet, more water, less meat, less bread: chickpeas and fruit and rice and soup and some sandwiches mostly the last few days. Trying to drink more water, drinking coffee somewhat routinely.

They'll more like hydraulic adjustments, and feel like something moving from deeper in my body to less deep but still in my body, versus from stomach to outside my body. There can be a lot of them after eating. Like, upwards of 50 the other night. It was awful. Not always this bad but yikes.\n\nThe pain is the worst. Located centrally, just above belly button, diffuse achey misery. A light feeling of nausea, not quite to where I would throw up, but I get that little rush of saliva like I might, constantly. \n\nThe diahrrea isn't watery, more like fluffy masses with urgency that comes flying out. My food is not fully digested. Today I had so many bathroom \"sessions\" I lost count...at least 10 producing weird poops. Maybe it was 15? Regardless, I couldn't believe it just kept coming. \n\nI have almost no gas whatsoever, which is just weird. \n\nI had IBS following e coli at age 20 and controlled around 23 through Heather von Vorous's Eating for IBS. Over the years, I was able to add more vegetables, fats, and even nuts and small amounts of chocolate, although I permanently cut dairy, high fat, alcohol, coconut, artificial sweeteners, and soy. I had healthy poops and very few symptoms as long as I stayed on a high-soluble fiber, low insoluble fiber diet (eating as much insoluble as I could manage.) with lean protein sources. \n\nAfter two years of baffling symptoms and quitting work, I finally shook free of \"chronic fatigue syndrome\"...that turned out to just be my extreme reaction to probiotic or fermented or cultured anything. (red flag?) \n\nThen, I took these antibiotics and a pile of ibuprofen for dental surgery. \n\nI now can NOT figure out what to eat. I thought I did a little better the last 2 weeks on low-fodmap, but it clearly isn't the answer and I am struggling with pain, burps, and feeling chained to the toilet. I have lost 10lbs (and only weighed 140 to start with) because eating makes me feel so ill. I can't just pop a probiotic like most people due to the brain fog issue. \n\nThe doctor said I do not have c diff, so at least there is that. They gave me Prilosec, which did nothing and I quit after 4 days because I didn't feel it was addressing the right problem. They then gave me rifaximin, which cued off HORRIFIC brain fog and depersonalization from dose 1. I couldn't continue without taking 2 weeks off work, and when I let them know of my side effects, they told me to stop taking it. \n\nOtherwise, they don't seem to have any ideas on why I get fog with gut alterations (and I mean severe, almost on disability fog\u2014I closed down my company of 10 years before I understood what was causing it). They don't seem to be suggesting much useful. I am inundated with the conflicting information on SIBO (is it real? is it miscategorized?). There's low fodmap and microbiome diet and low histamine and AIP and while I trust in diet's ability to heal after Heather's, all these diets conflict and I am very lost. Everything says \"eat probiotic foods!\" and I want to punch someone, because they make me so sick. So does oil of oregano and rifaximin...same damn symptoms as dairy-free yogurt and VSL3. \n\nI just want relief, and to get my microbiome back. What do I do? I'm sleeping well, still not eating dairy or gluten, trying low-fodmap, not taking any painkillers, chugging strong peppermint tea (the only thing that seems to confer any degree of relief), trying to reduce stress...help.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

On the beginning of this february I suffered a knee injury, which was quite painful. I was told that I need Physical Therapy and may need surgery, if PT fails I got scared and depressed. I was doing PT, and was visiting my psychiatrist because of the depression and anxiety. He prescribed Klonazepam. My GP prescribed Indomethacine to help me with the burning feeling inside of my knee. So this was my routine for about 10 days or so, when I started noticing that while I was sitting at work the burning pain started spreading from my knee all the way over my calves and my feet, it was horrible and excrutiating. Then my other knee started to burn inside. I ditched the pills, on doctors advice but the burning didn't subside. After every PT it was worse, and it was all over my legs at that point, from my hips to the tips of my toes. It was the burning and the sensation of deep pain. I had several panick attacks a day, my psychiatrist gave me xanax. After that my feet started to feel burning and coldness. So I started googling and asking doctors what could it be. Google said MS so i was scared like hell, also peripheral neuropathy which scared me as well. My GP suggested a neuro visit so I went to my neurologist who did and EMNG, and told me I don't have Peripheral or Diabetic Neuropathy, and that my results were excellent. I also did an MRI of brain and spinal cord which was excellent. I also did a complete bloodwork and everything was excellent. After all of the tests, my symptoms still remain in my feet to this day, 4 months later. Burning, coldness, hypersensitivity, deep pain. It is much better when im bare feet and also symptoms are better at night than during the day. Pain never wakes me from sleep so I enjoy sleep. I have in this 4 months talked to a lot of doctors, neuros, friends who study medicine and no one has a clue on what could it be. Its kinda hard living like this, you don't enjoy things anymore, you hate your life and the only thing worth living for is finding a relief for the pain. It's also worth mentioning that 2 months ago I developed a widespread muscle twitches, for which my neuro says are benign. I'm posting here because I haven't got a clue what to do next.

I am getting very hot, nausea returns, and then I begin to become dizzy and my vision gets spotty. Luckily my mom got a seat next to me to I get her attention and let her know discretely I\u2019m feeling bad (I hate being vulnerable in public). Then a bit later I get very light headed and pass out. Apparently this happens twice according to my mom though I don\u2019t remember the second. When I woke back up I was sweating and still not feeling well. I tell my mom I need to get to the restroom because I may need to throw up. I make it there but once I get in no longer need to. I go back to my seat and my stomach begins to hurt again and I have to use the airline puke bag to throw up a couple times. I then begin to feel a bit better and it\u2019s just about time to descend.

I'm not sure what exactly this is, but I'm interested in seeing if I fit into any category of a disorder or even personality type or if anyone can relate to what this sounds like.\n\nI am very observant of EVERYTHING. Sometimes, even to a fault. I overthink everything and try to analyse anything I can. ^^These are things people think are \"cool\" about me, but I find to be very complicating to live with, at times. Social events and gatherings/interactions, no matter how large or small, are living hell. Can't talk sometimes for like an entire day and I get questioned about it when I, myself, don't have the answer. I have a photographic memory and I'm VERY empathetic. It's always been difficult for me to hang out with ppl my same age, because I'm vastly different and misunderstood, most of the time. I have a bad tendency to say the same phrase redundantly sometimes. I literally jolt at sudden, loud noises, which I've always been made fun of. I'm also hyper-sensitive and one small argument can ruin my entire day. I have organizational issues, but I try to keep them at bay. I enjoy learning about certain topics for an EXTENSIVE period of time and I try not to discuss them with others too much, for their sake.\n\nOut of all of these things, the strongest plight is the social one. I am extremely awkward, but good company to be around, if I don't say something too eccentric from the norm.\n\nAnyway, if this sounds like anything or not, let me know. I'm utterly curious.

To start off, im 23 years old and in the military. Last summer, I went to a 20 day event where I was \"rucking\" with a large backpack that had a constant 40-45 pounds and a weapons slung around my upper traps (8 pounds) with a helmet that was 4-5 pounds (so expect a lot of forward head posture). After that event, I started having pain in the back right side of my head after about 3 weeks and I was scared i had something bad going on so i did every vascular test possible lol. I had an MRA, CT, CTA, Ultrasound of my neck, x-rays and everything and found nothing. Been to a lot of Physical therapy that didnt seem to help (Worked A LOT on deep neck flexors like chin tucks, resisted isometric contractions for the cervical flexors/extensors things of that manner) and A LOT of scapular retraction keeping my shoulder blades out and back because i DO have rounded shoulders and I have constantly been trying to work on I,T,Y's and W's to develop those lower traps and face pulls but still seem to get the suboccipital tightness. Its not necessarily debilitating pain, but more so an annoyance of tightness. I used to do a little bit of powerlifting and havent been able to do so for the past 9 months now. The right side of my SCM is also tight and my right ear feels kind of full all the time (but thats usually the case when your SCM is tight) and I already had the MRA/MRI of that with normal results sooo irdk. Chiropractic has helped more than anything (with the activator method technique usually) and would relieve that pain but nothing had really been fixed (I dont let them adjust my neck too much since im not really comfortable with the idea). Every time I wake up my upper right trap is super tight and it takes a bit of movement and external rotation for it to get back to normal ( i usually sleep on back and side). Also my pillow is pretty flat but not too flat because ive tried a bunch of different pillows thinking that was the problem. Just so weird and I want to be able to lift again but idk wtf i actually should be exercising since ive tried so much. I always ask the PTs if i need another MRI of the cervical spine but all have told me i present no neurological symptoms of actually needing one and it is true, i definitely feel and understand this is more of a musculoskeletal thing if anything.

On week 3 I got told it was just a random bacteria (could\u2019ve gone away by itself without antibiotics)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMedication | dose | times taken :\n\n\\- Naproxen | 500mg | twice daily for 7 days\n\n\\- Ciprofloxacin | 500 mg | twice daily for 7 days\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeek 2 :\n\nSymptoms (cause?) :\n\n\\- Pain on right flank, worse when laying down on one side (pain 8/10 when laying down, else intermittent)\n\n\\- Not feeling \u201cthere\u201d, as in almost-depersonification (medication?)\n\n\\- Lessened testicle pain\n\n\\- Groin pain/discomfort\n\n\\- Big loss of appetite (can still eat a bit)\n\n\\- Nausea, close to vomiting\n\n\\- Tired (sleep schedule messed up by hospital visits late at night)\n\n\\- Heart palpitations\n\n\\- Pain on upper left of the chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTests and diagnostic :\n\n\\- Seen doctor, no diagnostic. I\u2019m personally feeling like its appendicitis.\n\n\\- Urine, blood, lungs x-ray tests were not conclusive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMedication | dose | times taken :\n\n\\- None\n\n\\- Sometimes would take advil, sleeping pills and ginger Gravols for pain, to sleep and nausea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeek 3 :\n\nSymptoms (cause?) :\n\n\\- Pain moved from right flank to right of the navel, same Y axis as the navel.\n\n\\- Intermittent testicle pain (pain 1-4/10)\n\n\\- Groin pain/discomfort\n\n\\- Intense tiredness (sleep schedule all weird + exams?) to the point where I could faint\n\n\\- Appetite coming back up, almost back to normal\n\n\\- Occasional nausea\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTests :\n\n\\- Urine, abdomen X-ray, blood test.\n\n\\- Physical test.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDiagnostic :\n\n\\- Mesenteric adenitis.

All negative results. My blood was A+\n\n\\- Echography for epididymitis recidivism, radiologist said the epididymis is fine.\n\n\\- I am ordered an abdomen and pelvis scan THAT I NEED TO DECIDE ON. The doctor gave me the sheet and told me to take the decision by myself rather or not I want to do the CT scan. I am unsure because of the radiation. I did 3 x-rays, a head CT (daily headaches) and would now do this CT scan in this past month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDiagnostic :\n\n\\- None\n\nMedication :\n\n\\- Over-the-counter meds, on need. Taking acetaminophen reg. for daily headaches\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday (week 5) :\n\nSymptoms :\n\n\\- Testicle pain (1-7/10, for some reason worse at 4-5 pm but discomfort/pain throughout the day, averages 3/10)\n\n\\- Same abdominal pain, sometimes hangs lower. Will be mild sometimes.\n\n\\- Groin discomfort/pain\n\n\\- Discomfort in pubic area and in right leg near hip bone sometimes\n\n\\- Easily fatigued, exhausted at 5pm, where I wasn\u2019t usually\n\n\\- 2/10 dizziness\n\n\\- 2/10 confusion\n\n\\- Feeling drunk/feeling \u201cnot there\u201d\n\n\\- Very occasional diarrhea\n\n\\- Occasional nausea\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDiagnostic :\n\n\\- None, haven\u2019t gotten to the hospital as I\u2019m still thinking if I should go do my CT scan (ref to week 4 tests).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMedication :\n\n\\- Over-the-counter meds, tempted to take ibuprofen for my abdominal pain but I\u2019m abstaining. Acetaminophen for daily headaches, almost once daily. Had amitriptyline but doctor ordered me to stop for a while because red dots on skin for a day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHighlights of the entire month :\n\n\\- Testicular pain, diagnosed non-STD related epididymitis with a bacteria that could've gone away by itself apparently. Took Ciprofloxacin. Week 4, testicle pain comes back in 75% strength at times. Groin discomfort.\n\n\\- Abdomen pain which started at the right flank but moved to the right of the navel but on the same Y-axis. Now some hip bone/pubic area discomfort.\n\n\\- Couldn\u2019t eat much at all on week 2 and high-level nausea but no vomiting.\n\n\\- One doctor pressed hard on the spot near my navel and it would hurt as he presses down. Same doctor told me all this could be anxiety, but I am not stressed and still feel symptoms.\n\n\\- Since week 4, easily tired, 2/10 dizziness, 2/10 confusion, occasional nausea.\n\n\\- Doctor told me I have to decide if I want to do a CT scan for abdomen and pelvis. It\u2019s a lot of radiation, I am 20 years old and already did 3 x-rays and a head CT the past month (daily headaches).\n\n\\- Been on naproxen for 2 weeks.\n\n\\- Some heart burn symptoms throughout week 2. Very occasional now.\n\n\\- Need to take ginger Gravol, ibuprofen, sleeping pill in order to function normally sometimes (I use them less and less nowadays)\n\n\\- For fever, I've been constantly in between 37.5-37.8 celcius with a rectal thermometer, which is almost-fever.\n\n\\- I can still work my student job, even with all the symptoms.\n\n\\- When I'm distracted, symptoms are lessened. But they are still annoying.\n\n\\- Multiple blood tests and urine tests came out fine (all negative) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestions/interrogations I have :\n\n1. Should I do the abdomen and pelvis CT scan (under the context I mentioned)?\n2. Should I be concerned with the fact that it could be a missed appendicitis?\n3. Should I be concerned of sepsis? Long shot, but asking.\n4. Could all this be related to the Ciprofloxacin I took?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you all very much for your answers. My morale has been quite down this past month.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I sleep for around 7  to 9 hours a day. Whenever I wake up, I feel really tired, pain in my  lower back and when I stand up I feel dizzy and feel like I am losing  consciousness and lose vision for a few seconds (static vision) with  chills in my brain during the day too. I feel tired all the long except  for one hour after bathing. I feel breathless too with all this and get  tired really fast after doing even minor exercises. I was used to do  really hard training in martial arts or about 14 hours of exercise  during the week including yoga before about 7 months. At this time, I  was completely healthy with no problems at all. I was used to sleep at  10 and wake up at 5. But then my exams began and I had to completely  stopped my training and put on more mental pressure. I was used to study  and sit all day long which was really tiring. Now as my exams are  finished, I am trying to change my lifestyle again back to how it was.  The problem is because of headache and tiredness and other factors. I  sleep at 10 or 11. For the past week, I wake up abruptly at 3 am to  drink water, and i just feel sleepy, not tired or i dont have a  headache. But then, I sleep again so i can have a complete sleep, but  then sometimes i dont even hear the alarm, or even if i hear it, I feel  completely stuck to my bed. Even standing up for water seems impossible.  Because of all this, I wake up at around 8 or 9 am. I don't want this  to happen forever, I wanna get out of this trap asap and be like how I  was before. Any help is appreciated.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Her skin does not harden or change color when this happens. She is always in pain when she has a swelling episode. The pain extends from her foot to her knee. It hurts her to walk or stand and she needs to elevate her her leg and rest. In 2015 the swelling started to spread to her left foot. But it doesn\u2019t swell as bad as the right foot. Doctors have failed at figuring out what is wrong with her. \nThey checked her veins, lymph nodes, liver, kidneys and they had a whole scan of her foot and they were all clear. They claim she\u2019s healthy. But is she really when she can\u2019t even enjoy a simple walk without being in pain? I have invested in the copper sock for her and it has helped her significantly when she is doing physical activity either her legs. But she still gets pain just as bad even though she doesnt swell as badly. She has been diagnosed with hypoglycemia her junior year of high school which was just 6 years ago. I am not sure if that could be a cause for this. \nShe\u2019s dealt with this problem her whole life and she\u2019s only 22.

On mobile so sorry for formatting! \n\n\nTl;dr I'm 23 and am consistently ill despite no known conditions and a healthy and active lifestyle. \n\nThe long and short of it is is that I'm consistently ill despite having no known conditions besides anxiety and depression. I'm only 23. \n\nI seem to pick up any bug or cold going round and really struggle to recover from even a cold.\n\nI've spoken with a therapist about the possibility of it being triggered due to my anxiety and even the possibility of it all being psychosomatic. However i don't really think so as most issues include physical symptoms or require antibiotics.\n\nSo far this year, i have had a UTI, the flu, food poisoning and bacterial tonsillitis (my current ailment!). All of this plus a few sniffles and colds.\n\nWhen I'm ill, I'm completely wiped out, unable to walk further than to the bathroom, struggle to eat and feel very weak. It seems it takes me far longer than others to recover.\n \nFor example when suffering with the flu I was unable to walk for over a week. I am prone to delirium and sometimes have brief visual/auditory hallucinations when sick. \n\nSimilarly with food poisoning, I was actively ill (diarrhoea and vomiting) for 5 days and took a further 5 to recover completely. \n\nI do consider myself quite healthy however. I don't smoke, take drugs or drink more than about twice a month. I'm a healthy weight for my height and am active. \n\nI'm a master's student in the final weeks of my degree and have a job on the side to hold down, so consistently taking time off is really damaging to me financially. \n\nI've definitely let this go on long enough and feel if I were born in a different era I'd have been long dead by now lol. \n\nThanks in advance, any suggestions would be much appreciated!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

This story might end up being very long, so I will attempt to stick to the details.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is a 25 year old caucasian male, 5'11\" &amp; 230lbs and we are located in Ontario, Canada. He has no prior health conditions besides severe sleep apnea (obstructive) and is very fit, competed as a powerlifter etc. Resting heart rate is between 40-50 beats per minute. His diastolic and systolic are averaging about 140/110. \n\nOn June 5th.. He was at work doing a non-labour intensive job.. he became dizzy and felt tingling in his left arm, and strong abdominal burning sensations. He collapsed and when EMT arrived he was diaphoretic and the numbness had spread to his left leg as well. At the hospital, he had CT scans done, ultrasounds, and upon the result of a CT scan - it had showed a small ovoid lacunar infarction in the left posterior limb of the internal capsule. There were two scans done at this hospital that confirms this. They suggested we get an MRI as soon as possible. \n\nThe next day, now at home, he was feeling okay for the most part..but then suddenly grabbed his head and started to complain about pain. He asked me to take him to emergency. By the time we got there, I could see his face flushed, his heavy breathing. When we got to triage, within 15 minutes, his condition worsened. At this point his blood pressure was much higher and he was in tears from the pain and the tingling sensation in his left arm was still there at that point. \n\nAfter talking to the doctor and getting another CT scan, they said that there was nothing wrong with his brain, and that they diagnosed it as a \"headache\" and released him. Keep in mind, there were two other scans at another hospital that revealed the \"lacunar infarction.\"\n\nNow a few days later, we are still waiting for an MRI. He still has the tingling sensation in his left hand, and the odd head pain, and still has stomach pain.   I can't wrap my head around this being just a headache, because of its length.. it has been happening for 7 days straight. I've never seen someone endure so much pain from a headache when we went to emergency that night. \n\nI was hoping someone could help!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I\u2019m 24F, 5\u20194\u201d and 125 pounds. I live in the US and I only take birth control. For the past two years on and off, I\u2019ve had an annoying, dull ache in the same spot in my lower right quadrant. Sometimes the pain is more sharp and painful, but most of the time it\u2019s just there and bothersome. I mentioned it to my GP maybe a month or two after it began hurting, and they did a transvaginal ultra sound to see if I had an ovarian cyst. They found nothing and sent me on my way. The pain continued and seemed to be happening daily. I went back to my GP a few months later and they sent me to a GI doc. GI doc scheduled a colonoscopy to check for chrons but that was negative. I didn\u2019t have my follow up appointment for 6 months after the colonoscopy, but the pain persisted. When I finally had that follow up, I was referred to a gynecologist because they didn\u2019t seem to think my problem was gastrointestinal. So a couple of months after that I finally get the gyno appointment. They do another transvaginal ultrasound (to no avail of course) and have basically told me that it could possibly be endometriosis, but they would need to operate to see if that\u2019s what it is. I\u2019ve held off on that because I wanted to see if it could possibly be anything else before getting cut open. I\u2019ve also had numerous blood tests from the beginning of the pain to now, all to no avail. \n\nI was recently on Facebook and saw an article on chronic appendicitis and to be honest, my symptoms are in line with that pretty well. I mentioned this to my GP at my annual physical last week and she more or less ignored my concern and said \u201cwell it\u2019s obviously nothing that serious so just hope it goes away on its own\u201d. I had a CT scan about 6 months before any of this started happening so I\u2019m pretty certain if I did have chronic appendicitis, it would not have shown on that scan. \n\nShould I be looking more into chronic appendicitis, or is it safer to assume that all of these issues could be endo? I do have other symptoms of endo so it wouldn\u2019t shock me if that\u2019s what this is, but at the same time I find it odd that the pain is always in that one specific spot. I\u2019m not a doctor, but I feel like endometriosis pain wouldn\u2019t be so localized. \n\nAny advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

(I\u2019m also not an experienced redditor so I\u2019m not sure how to structure this but...) \n\nI don\u2019t get the typical hangover. I don\u2019t get the headaches, stomach pains, nausea, or sensitivity to light or sound. Occasionally I\u2019ll have cottonmouth when I wake up but that\u2019s it. \n\nHowever, whenever I drink excessively I have this really weird feeling for days after. It\u2019s a very difficult feeling to describe but the best way I\u2019ve found is \u201ceverything feels off\u201d. My perception of time is disoriented (days can fly by me or go really slowly), my decisions don\u2019t feel like my own (it\u2019s as if I\u2019m just along for the ride), I don\u2019t feel *mentally normal*. Another thing that I find really difficult to put into words is how I\u2019ll see two outcomes for a decision I\u2019m about to make, but the actual outcome ends up being inconsequential and disappointing. It\u2019s like I\u2019m trying to predict something but the result doesn\u2019t matter and it could have gone either way without my influence. {A lot of this feels really dumb when I reread it, and I know there\u2019s a better way to describe the way I\u2019m feeling but I just can\u2019t. That\u2019s partially why it\u2019s taken me so long to seek help\u2014 it\u2019s frustrating} I just don\u2019t feel like myself. \n\nYou might expect this \u201cfeeling\u201d to also affect me in other areas, but I feel as though I perform the same in the classroom and in sports. I took my AP US History Exam when I felt this way and was fairly confident in my performance. My test and quiz scores in other classes also seem the same. But while I\u2019m taking these assessments it feels like almost every answer is a best guess; it\u2019s like I am an arms-length away from my memory and all of my actually correct answers feel \u201coff.\u201d Also I felt like I played the same on the lacrosse field regardless of how mentally present I was. \n\nI should also say that I can somewhat handle my alcohol for someone my age, I believe. And I only get this \u201coff feeling\u201d when I drink way too much. I could have 3/4 beers with a couple friends and be fine afterwards, but when I get stupid drunk 8-10 beers or consistent drinking (like the duration of a wedding night) I\u2019ll get this feeling afterwards. \n\nThis has happened several times, too (maybe 5/6). I\u2019m also currently experiencing one of these \u201coff weeks\u201d after my cousin\u2019s grad party. \n\nTowards the end of every \u201coff week\u201d I start doubting that anything\u2019s actually wrong with me and I start to worry that this is just how I\u2019ll feel forever now. I convince myself that my perception of life is just changed and the feeling will never go away. But every time (it seems like it takes exactly one week) everything becomes sharper and I feel \u201cfully conscious.\u201d \n\nI know a lot of this seems like rambling. I know I did a poor job of explaining some things. I know I shouldn\u2019t be drinking and I try to keep myself in check, but I\u2019m a dumb kid. But please, I\u2019ve googled and googled and googled. Nobody seems to have any similar problems, and my mom\u2014 while concerned\u2014 didn\u2019t provide much help besides \u201cDon\u2019t drink.\u201d \n\nSo please help me out.

I will clearly label the back story and my current situation that it has lead to separately. That way if you dont want to read the whole thing you can skip to my current condition. TL;DR also included at end.\n\nAge: 20 Sex: Male Height: 5'11 Weight: 167 Race: Half Black, Half White Known Medical Conditions: anxiety, non classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia, current e.coli infection (mild diahrrea symptoms)\n\nBACK STORY\nI'll try to keep the back story as short as possible. And will answer any possible left out information in the comments.\n\n4 months ago I left to Vietnam. After 2 months I started getting diahrrea (only symptom). Went to hospital and stayed 9 days. I was diagnosed with gastroenteritis.. given tons of antibiotics, then discharged. 5 days later I got food poisoning, went to hosptial 1 night, felt fine next day and was discharged.\n\nI decided to fly home since I kept getting sick and wanted to see a doctor in America (where I live). 2 days later after landing I got sick again with fever, chills, headaches. It went away after 3 days (this was about 2 weeks ago). I felt fine for a day or 2, and then started getting progressively more tired and out of breath when moving around.\n\nI tried waiting it out for a week - and it just got worse - until finally one night I woke up with racing heart, unable to breath, and went to the ER. They said I was dehydrated, admitted me to the hospital, diagnosed me with 2 strains of \"common\" e coli, gave me antibiotics, and discharged me.\n\nCURRENT SITUATION\n\n12 hours after I was discharged, I woke up the next day after a full 8 hours of sleep EXTREMELY tired. Felt like I was falling asleep constantly. I had to continuously pee due to the IV from the day before. But each time I got up to go I got more dizzy, out of breath, and my heart was racing. My chest feels tight, like someone is pulling down on it. I tried waiting for about 30 minutes, but it only got worse and worse as I started hyperventilating...so I went to the ER.\n\nAt the ER my heart rate was at 160 (came 4 days ago). Blood pressure has been normal to pre hypertensive. They said I was dehydrated again, with mildly high levels of bilirubin and calcium which eventually leveled out. But I still had the e coli. So i was admitted. And an infectious disease doctor as well as a cardiologist has been called in to help.\nThe infectious disease doctor confirmed I still had e coli but is unsure why. He ran tons of tests over the last few days, and everything has come back negative (except the e coli). For now he has decided to stop antibiotics and monitor me. I have also had CAT Scan, EKG, and echocardiogram done. The cardiologist has said everything came back normal, and hasn't done anymore tests on me.\n\nI'm still having lots of trouble breathing and a racing heart whenever I stand or sit up. The hosptilast and infectious disease doctor both are confused and do not think it's related to the infection. But they confirmed that my heart rate jumps from around 50-60 to around 150 -160 whenever I stand, and stays that way until I need to sit back down.\n\nI have yet to see the cardiologist again, hospitalist has no clue what do do, and infectious disease doctor is trying to figure things about, but not making progress. Anxiety has been ruled out as the cause due to the fact that its posture specific and the platypnea happens 100% of the time I'm upright. In addition, sometimes my heart rate will drop to 50 at times and stay that way regardless of my breathing unless I sit up or stand (in which it skyrockets).\nI'm quite concerned as platypnea is rare, and they are unable to figure out the cause after days. All organ function tests came back negative (heart, liver, thyroid, etc.)\n\nTL;DR I've been in and out of hosptial with GI infections over past month. All the sudden I have developed unexplainable platypnea and doctors still cant figure it out. All blood and organ function tests have come back ok.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I have a couple other weird quirks for example with license plates I immediately organize the letters and numbers into where they would fall on a typical phone keypad (2 is ABC, 3 is DEF, etc) and assign them to the musical tones they are associated with - old phones horizontally used the first three tones in a major scale on each row (yes, I'm a musician haha) and have to play with those melodies in my head.

They were quick episodes and occasionally this same pain would happen in the butt/pelvic area too, just much less frequently.

The stabbing would come in waves Monday - Tuesday and progressively got less severe. \n\n**Progress:**\nThe next few days I\u2019ve had pressure/pain in that same area below the belly button. No stabbing pain anymore, really. Not nearly as often at least. I have a little pain in my bottom right stomach, closer to my hip bone or whatever.

My UTI cultures were also negative. \n\n**Appendicitis?** Urgent care told me to keep an eye on the pain in fear of potential appendicitis. She seemed concerned.

One night it got bad that I ended up in the ER and got an ECG and a metabolic panel and my electrolytes tested. All tests came back normal and I was released and immediately followed up with a physician who had me do a 48 hour holter monitor. I got the results back as a normal sinus rhythm with only 2 PVCs that were said to benign. Things seemed to get better for a while until one night I got pretty bad chest pains again that got worse when breathing. I was convinced this was pleurisy and took ibuprofen and it went away after a week.  However a week or two later I found that I still had some aching in my chest along with a grinding noise sometimes when stretching my arms and chest out. I decided to go to my mothers physician who is known for being very thorough. He ordered a chest X-ray, metabolic panels, cancer markers, and another EKG. He referred me to a psychologist due to thinking its mostly anxiety induced due to chest wall pain. He also referred me to an electrophysiocardiologist which I have an appointment with this week. The tests he ordered all came back as normal by his interpretation and he said I probably have a chest muscle sprain or costochondritis and that my anxiety isn\u2019t helping it. I will say that I have learned some anxiety coping skills and they have helped, but the pain doesn\u2019t always subside without ibuprofen. I\u2019m just wondering if anyone has any suggestions on how to cure this pain faster or if anyone has gone through the same experience and has some tips for me. I am pretty athletic and i have been training for a half marathon for the last 7 months, my mom says running could be the problem but I ran a lot last summer and never got this. I also don\u2019t want to take ibuprofen all the time as I know it can cause stomach bleeding.\n\nTL;DR I\u2019ve had recurrent chest pain the last few months and it\u2019s come and gone with ibuprofen helping, thru testing from physicians they\u2019ve determined it\u2019s not heart related and prolly related to a chest muscle and anxiety.

Additionally, directly over the spot where it felt that the pain originated from is a large and noticeably swollen part of my belly. Also worth noting, I\u2019ve been near constantly constipated for the past month, having bowel movements maybe twice a week. \nFour days after these increase symptoms I went to urgent care, who told me to go to the E.R. immediately because I likely had appendicitis.

A 25 year old male from India. This is a bit neuroscience question. I'm asking for a possible idea of which I'm suffering from &amp; unable to diagnose since 6 years by many Doctors.\n\n  \n\n\nI was 19 and a University student who was the topper of the Department known for intelligence. And my friends &amp; myself went for a trip to a mountain nearby. It was a steep mountain. Half the away I got Asthma attack &amp; I found very difficult to breathe. I was born with Asthma &amp; I never experienced Asthma after the age of 11. All of a sudden Asthma returned after 8 years. Then the things happened has turned me into a mess that I'm right now. For a couple of days I was suffering from severe Asthma &amp; it resolved after taking meds. After this attack I experienced Insomnia for the first day. I found very sweaty &amp; couldn't get enough oxygen in my room. I didn't sleep even for a minute. Then every day went like this. I couldn't get enough Oxygen &amp; experienced shortness of breath at night while everyone else around me were normal. Almost 6 months I barely slept an hour during the night. The only change I felt daily is that after 5.30 AM I could feel good amount of fresh Oxygen &amp; suddenly went to sleep for an hour. I have no idea what it is. I had Psoriasis attack in a while &amp; I don't know why it happened. Due to this sleeping problem I felt tired, lethargic, fatigued, my eyes went so red &amp; I didn't attend the classes. This chronic &amp; serious Insomnia lasted almost 3 years so that I couldn't continue my degree &amp; I dropped college. Asthma is still there &amp; I get attacks whenever the climate gets cold. Now I get 6 hours sleep without any medications &amp; the sleep is not so that deep awaken by small sounds. The side effects which it gave is terrible &amp; it didn't resolve at all till now. That's why I'm exploring for diagnosis. The side effects started as soon as I fell insomniac. Those are,\n\n  \n\n\n**1. Low memory- I couldn't remember which I read even a minute before. I would read it again &amp; again then forget. I don't remember the names. It's like being on Dementia.**\n\n  \n\n\n**2. Concentration- I read a line almost ten times &amp; I couldn't understand it.

And I'm verbally very impaired compared to a Schizophrenia patient.**\n\n  \n\n\n**4. Hypoxia- This is the strongest suspicion I have because I experienced shortness of breath, lack of oxygen, fatigue, excessive sweating &amp; all the mental symptoms 24/7.

Three months ago, I felt an excruciating headache the moment I finished a race. I had never had such a headache before. It went away within ten minutes, but returned whenever I would exert myself more than a slight jog. I found that exercise was the only cause of my headaches. I wouldn't feel them at any other point in the day, but running became so painful that I stopped doing it altogether. I went to my doctor, who thought I had an aneurism, and then a hospital to get both an MRI and an MR Angiogram, but they found nothing. Finally a neurologist told me I had exercise-induced acute migraines, and that I would experience them for the rest of my life because they were genetic. She told me to take Ibuprofen and that we'd try Aimovig if that didn't work. Fortunately, Ibuprofen eased the pain enough for me to run again. What's more, after two weeks I tried running without Ibuprofen and found the headaches were completely gone. I haven't seen my neurologist since, and my doctor has let the issue go. I'm now training hard without a problem. But I'm still not satisfied. I always drank plenty of water and ate a healthy diet, and my symptoms didn't quite match with anything I found online.

I believe it is mostly constipation. Last night the pain became so discomforting I used laxatives, and enema. The enema helped a lot and cleared my first initial blocking perfectly.

It is exactly where my belly button is, but on the very edge of my chest(I can partially feel it on my side). So I drank my laxative, and while I did have a bowel movement, I still feel this discomfort. When I do have a bowel movement, or move/lay on my side the discomfort does for away for a little but inevitably returns. I think I can feel it close to the exit, but maybe it is so tough or dry that it isn't budging? I'm not sure what to do. I am trying to cleanse, as I drank a 10 OZ of this laxative from CVS with hardly any progress (maybe it helped break some down, but currently still feels very discomforting)\n\nIf anyone has suggestions, or possibly think it may be something else that would be great. I really would like for this to pass.\n\nIf this helps, I have recently adopted keto.

He referred me to the local hospital since the clinic couldn't do blood work on Sunday. Itchiness came shortly after the yellowed eyes. Hospital did blood work and an ultra sound and I was clear for hepatitis and whatever the ultrasound was for, I'm assuming blockages. Blood test showed heightened liver enzymes. I got blood work again mid week and the enzyme levels were the same. Here I am now still about the same yellowness, and itchy mainly at night.The symptoms of jaundice seem to be my only symptoms and they arent getting worse or better. I dont smoke cigs, I drink maybe 3 times a month on average and not heavily, I dont take any meds that are hard on the liver with any regularity, I eat a pretty standard diet on the daily: meat, carb, veg.

My height is about 5.5ft tall. I am messaging you to get some expert advice and counselling about my medication related to hypertension and blood pressure. Before that, I would like to give a short summary on how I became the victim of hypertension and how I had to take the path of medication to improve my health. I am an international student and my major is computer science. I live in Houston, Tx, I came to study here in the USA. This all happened in last December, 2018. Because of my overthinking nature, I tend to become anxious very quickly. So, the incident starts with my swollen leg. Since, I didn\u2019t use to do any exercise or walk, and sleep and eat more, my body used to ache all the time mostly during night. I used to have muscle ache, mostly in my leg and stretching to hip area. I used to feel a lot of joint ache and my toes always used to tickle. If I didn\u2019t urge to tickle the toes, there would be feeling of slight discomfort and pain. During night time, I used to feel my joint pain and tickling of toes all the time. The back of the knee at my right leg used to be my vulnerability point. The pain used to be right there at the back of the knee. For a month at least, I used to stay at home all the time, eating three times rice and fried eggs and watching laptop all the time. My sleep cycle usually started at 3:00 am in morning to 2:pm at afternoon. Then, suddenly one day, I felt a discomfort on my right leg at **back of the knee**. Just below the back of the knee, it was a bit swollen compared to left leg. Then I looked at google for diagnosis**. My big mistake in life!** Looking at google, all of my symptoms suggested **Deep Vein thrombosis**. I was really nervous now. Every time, I would think of ways to reduce the swollen lower leg at the back. All of these incidents were happening at the end of my semester too. My exam was coming within a week. This made me more anxious and different thoughts approached my curious mind. I thought to myself, now I have to go to hospital, hospital bills would be high.  I thought my GPA would go low because I have to concentrate on how to improve my health. Later that night, I woke up till 4:00 in the morning doing homework. That night I couldn\u2019t sleep. Same thought was always in the mind that I had to ask money from my parents again, have to go to hospitals, my Gpa would become low and I can\u2019t transfer to good school. Due to all these thoughts, I couldn\u2019t sleep. I decided to drink one beer and eat rice and lentils. NO luck. Now the anxiety was so much that whenever I tried to sleep, my heart would beat faster than normal, and I would have panic attacks. Whenever I tried to sleep, my heart would beat really fast and feeling as if I am going to have a heart attack. Then again next night, same cycle continued, I could not sleep. Same issue. Every time I tried to sleep, my face would be red and my temperature would be really high. No fever though.  Then I decided to go to clinic next day. There I was told my blood pressure was really high. It was 150/103. And They told me that this  is why you couldn\u2019t sleep. After this, I became more anxious and worried. Felt like my heart was beating faster than the normal gain but this time even more. No matter how many times I tried I couldn\u2019t sleep. This happened for almost five days. After that I went to my friend\u2019s house, there I was able to sleep for 3-4 hours that night. Then I decided to go back Nepal and get my health checked up. After reaching home, I could sleep but I would often feel my heart was beating faster and my face and ear would get red and warm. There in my country, I went to **Gangalal Hospital**, where the doctor checked my pressure and even at that time, I would think now my pressure would be sure 160 or 150. That sort of thinking would be there whenever I would visit a doctor. He checked up my pressure and it was 160/110. Again, super high. There he told me to lay down and he checked my heart beat. He said everything seems fine. He told me I was being nervous and anxious and I tend to overthink a lot. I was told to do a certain blood test. **My vitamin D was really low**. And **I have mild fatty liver too**. The doctor then put a certain blood pressure checking machine in my hand for 24 hours to monitor. The results were fluctuating. The highest would be **168/113**. The lowest would be **124/ 84**. And average of **134-140/86-90**. This again made me nervous. He gave me a medicine of **50 mg repace** and suggested me to take for **6-month cycle** and come back for follow up. I am here at Texas and now my medicine is soon going to be out. As for my health, after taking his medication, my blood pressure began to show some improvement, during my time at my country, it lowered down to 140/80 which was still high. I bought a blood pressure checking machine from Walmart. After so many months taking the medicine, my blood pressure at night is usually in the range of **128/80** and in morning it is **117/70**. Sometimes when I am stressed out it becomes **140/86**.  So, I was wondering whom should I consult as my previous doctor at my country told me for a follow up after taking 6 months medication. I think I have seen some improvement. Should I continue the medicine or should I lower the **mg** of medicine? Right now, I am taking 50 mg. So, should I lower it to 25 mg or continue. I would really appreciate your expert guidance and counselling on this matter.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Back in October I got sick with a cold/bronchitis so I took cough medicine(dimetapp) and around the same time I had a spike in blood pressure and heart rate that would not go below 100. I felt as if I constantly pumped with adrenaline and after about a week or 2 my blood pressure returned to normal. However I couldn't leave the house because my heart rate would randomly increase without trigger and I would delve into a panic attack my veins would just feel filled with adrenaline. \n\nI got a blood test that showed slightly elevated thyroid levels and I was sent to an endocrinologist but before I could get further testing I got a call saying that he was no longer with the office and the next endo was only available in June. With medication to control the anxiety and just dealing with hell of not being able to leave the house with being sent into random panic attacks I eventually stopped having anxiety and I had a blood test showing normal thyroid levels. However i still felt physical symptoms such as feeling off balance, feeling as if my blood pressure would drop randomly, fatigue, and just overall physical and mental discomfort such as moodiness and depression. I occasionally get pain in my back behind by ribs (like kinda where kidneys are but above it). \n\nI got a holter monitor recently to check for abnormal rhythm or anything like that and it showed nothing other than my heart rate sometimes going fast (highest 178) but was otherwise normal in the 80s. But I recently have been having a return in the symptoms I described above with dizziness.

E.g. with my friends- if one of them happen to text me back later than usual, I'll feel super resentful and start being upset with them bcos I feel like they don't give a shit- but then they reply in a nice way and I immediately start my over attachment to them again\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nidk man. These days, I just feel like I'm living in the  short alternate \"good\" periods I have, where im hopeful and energetic, and just waiting for something to go shit and for the sadness and emptiness to kick in again. I really do think I have at least mild bpd. I recently found out that my dad attempted suicide twice when he was in college, so I guess that also ups the chance I'm also fucked in the head? \n\nPlease let me know what you think, because I need to do something before this gets worse.

I will try to keep it as short as possible while also explaining in detail what\u2019s going on with me.\nI\u2019m a male, 22 years old. I\u2019ve been to the doctor around 3 times in the past month, they say I have a \u201clow risk profile\u201d for heart disease which I do believe. But on the other hand, my grandmother from my fathers family died from heart failure and had open heart surgery (she was 80, I think it was just old age) but also my uncle, my father\u2019s brother, now 59, had open heart surgery at 54, and heart problems. I honestly think my problem is my past. I\u2019ve been smoking marijuana every single day, multiple times a day for 5+ years straight, no more than 6. I have stopped completely though, approximately 11 days since i\u2019ve stopped. But I know that\u2019s not very long. Although I do feel significan-well, a little better, I also still can never breathe properly. It\u2019s very difficult for me to take a deep \u201csatisfactory\u201d breath. I\u2019d say once every 30-40 tries or so. I\u2019ve also been having heart palpitations for the past 6-8 months, but they\u2019re not often whatsoever. Once every 2 or so weeks, but definitely concerning to me since it kind of sends a \u201cshock\u201d through my body, even though i\u2019ve read they\u2019re rather common. So I go to the doctor and explain what\u2019s happening, they tell me to stop smoking completely so i\u2019ve done so. My next visit, I had an ultrasound done on my heart, also taking a stress test the same day. One thing I regret was canceling my appointment for my pacemaker to \u201crecord\u201d my palpitations, I would\u2019ve had to miss work, and I desperately needed the money to pay bills and sorts. I am going to reschedule that appointment. After my visit for the ultrasound and stress test, they didn\u2019t say anything was out of the ordinary... they actually didn\u2019t say anything at all, after my ultrasound, the lady just said \u201cokay he\u2019s ready to do your stress test now\u201d. After my stress test, he just directed me out the door to leave. But I feel as if something WAS wrong or not looking good, they would\u2019ve said something. I also have an appointment on July 1st for basically discussing results I believe. I\u2019ve been drinking 65-80 oz of water every single day ever since the third week of May, i\u2019ve also been trying to avoid red meats.\n\nI apologize this is longer than I thought it would be. Any feedback or opinions are greatly appreciated. Thank you all so much.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I'm a 33 year old Caucasian Male (6'0 195lb)\n\nI  had a skiing accident on March 22 2019 and was diagnosed with a TPF  injury left foot requiring surgery that involved internal fixation (2  screws) and bone graft. I was non weight bearing for a period of 6 weeks  in which I was using crutches to get around and then 2 weeks of partial  weight bearing then into a full weight bearing stage.\n\nLet  me start off with a few symptoms after my surgery that were a bit odd -  I noticed that my left foot was numb and felt a bit odd and tingly and  then hot feeling and constant pain in my foot. I would have my wife come  over and press hard into the bottom of my foot to get relief but that  relief would fade quickly.\n\nI dealt with  all that and wasn't weight bearing so it wasn't a huge issue just  thought it was odd and I was assured after I was full weight bearing the  numbness would fade. So here we are about 5-6 weeks of full weight  bearing - I've been back at the gym and riding the exercise bike and I'm  a fairly active individual. The problem is now I'm experiencing  moderate to severe pain on my toe joints where they flex when I walk and  the numbness doesn't seem to be fading. The area around the knee and  leg aren't really an issue anymore and I'm basically at full flex and  been able to do most exercises such as light leg presses and extensions  without any pain or discomfort.\n\nMy  question is why am I getting this odd pain in toe joints? I can feel the  pain become more extreme when I take my thumb or finger and press down  on my middle toe right where the joint is. Please I'm looking for any  medical advice as I'm thinking there is possibly a problem with the  hardware that is causing this issue.\n\nI  will advise that my surgeon didn't think it was an absolute necessity to  do Physical Therapy as in he stated it was just a time and money dump  and I had already missed enough work. He was confident that I would be  able to rehab on my own which I have been doing at the gym but this toe  thing is preventing me from walking long distances and possibly altering  the way I walk.\n\nOh I also wanted to  mention on the left side of my left leg the screw is kinda protruding  from the skin a little bit and hurts like a sob when I knock it against  something.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Here's the general info and the picture (https://ibb.co/jbYqdYP):\n\nAge: 29\n\nSex/Gender: Female\n\nHeight and weight: 5'6 and 180 lbs\n\nRace/Ethnicity: Caucasian\n\nGeographic location (eg. Canada): Romania\n\nPre-existing medical issues (if any): Skin allergy during the spring+summer (possibly urticaria)\n\nCurrent medications (if any): Been taking nose drops for 13 years (addicted to it) \n\nDuration of complaint (how long has this been happening): 9 days\n\nSymptoms (be specific): Since last thursday I've had a tightness in my neck in the upper part (refer to my picture please) and I've felt like the muscles on the back of my head have been weak and I was putting in conscious effort into trying to hold my head straight. \n\nSince 2 days ago I started to also experience an increase in the tightness in the upper circle and today I've started feeling tight in the lower circle (near the sternum). The best description I can give is that someone has their thumb pressing against those 2 areas. These symptoms persist for as long as I'm awake, they don't go away no matter what I'm doing and I'm chronically aware of the fact that I'm putting in more effort than normal to breathe. The discomfort is about 7 on a scale from 1 to 10. \n\nEarlier today I came back from the store (it's like 35 celsius during the day) and walked a total of 10 minutes during which it got worse and during the last 5 minutes I was walking with my mouth open and breathing shorter breaths and more often. Even after returning home and sitting for 10 minutes, I was breathing like this. It felt like I was suffocating. \n\nI went to the doctor who checked my blood pressure (it was 118 with 87), my heart and lungs (they sounded normal to her), my jugular was alright, my lymph nodes normal sized and my thyroid has 2 small cysts on the left lobe, the right lobe was slightly bigger but she said it was nothing to worry about. \n\nAdditional info:\n1. Have been a smoker for 11 years (I don't drink or do drugs)\n2. Installed an air conditioner and when it's on (it's on quite often during the day because my boyfriend feels hot non-stop) 8 days ago and it blows straight into my desk where I sit at most of the day.\n3. These breathing difficulties do not wake me up from my sleep. I don't feel like choking in my sleep. \n4. Both the doctor and my parents have explained it away by saying it's anxiety. I am an anxious person and would accept this explanation but the problem is I never felt this way and this pressure on these 2 areas WILL.NOT.GO.AWAY. until I sleep. I find it hard to believe that anxiety makes you feel tight NON-STOP as long as you're awake for 9 days.\n5. I'm not coughing or wheezing, but if I walk around I start to feel like I'm slightly suffocating and I walk with my neck straightened and breathe through my mouth.\n6. My hands/fingers are not blue. I don't have cyanosis anywhere. \n7. I'm not eliminating any secretions but my chest feels like when you have a heavy cold and you're during that stage where the mucus accumulates in your lungs and your chest feels tight. I've experienced little pain back in my upper back. The most annoying thing is the tightness in my neck, I'm doing my best to not pay mind to it but it's becoming unbearable to feel like someone has their thumb on your neck and won't let go. \n8. Not a hypochondriac, never been to the ER, never had even a general check-up until today. The only things I've been to a doctor for was to go to the dentist or to an allergy doctor to help me out with my skin allergy that appears every spring+summer (possibly urticaria).\n \nI'm wondering if I caught a chest infection, there's stuck mucus in the lungs or I'm having inflammation in my lung area but for the life of me I can't explain this horrible tightness in the neck. I also started thinking what if it's thrombosis/embolism but I'm not an expert so I don't know. \n\nThanks for reading and I hope someone can help because this situation is new for me and it's becoming unbearable.

They may all be related or may not be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am 30, white and native American descent, smoker, 2 kids via c section and tubal ligation (clips).\n\nI will start with my mothers history of non hodgkins lymphoma, she had it in her thyroid. She was treated with radiation and it remains in remission\n\n \n\nIn October 2015 we moved into an old Vietnam era brick home on base where I live (hysband is military) i immediately noticed sudden and severe ear infections but figured it was due to stress because of the loss of my grandma from stroke, best friend to suicide, dog being hit by a car, and husbands coworkers killed in a tragic accident all just 2 weeks prior to the move. My ears are always infected it seems but I fear I may have done permanent damage. I've all but lost most hearing in my right ear. For a while it felt as if it was clogged but now just a small bit. For a while I suffered severe tinnitus but it seems to have subdued. The lymph nodes on the right side of my neck has been swollen for 10 years. The ones under my ears come and go as well as the ones under my chin. My husbands health also declined but its irrelevant I suppose to this story. When I went to west palm beach for a while I noticed my groin and armpit nodes also swole up. That was the only time that happened. That was roughly July 2016. In Oct 2016 I noticed some slight lower back pain. It came from no where and has literally not gone away. I noticed a lump where my SI joint is and the pain started there.  Some days it was unbearable.  It would range from a searing hot pain to a dull aching one.  Sometimes it would be/is hot yi the touch. After being seen and having xrays done it was determined that I had osteoarthritis.  I was 27 or 28. My health began to very quickly deteriorate. I went from the pinnacle of health with never even as much as a cold once a year, to arthritis.  Around that time I also dropped alot of weight very very fast.  I dropped 50 lbs in just a few months and never tried to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   Around oct of 2017 I saw my doc once again. Trying to figure out what the lump was on the SI joint. I was concerned because I had clamps placed on my tubes for my tubal ligation and read how they can migrate into other places and cause issues. I just wanted to make someone listen to me and check it out. Finally the doc I saw this day acknowledged the fact my WBC was sky high (as it had been for atleast a year). He immediately referred me to hematology oncology. Nov 2017 rolls around and I visit the oncologist. Bloodworks shows some sort of possible autoimmune issue or something. I told the oncologist my issues and he ordered a ct scan. He said the nodes on my neck were nothing to worry about but that there was a mass on my ovary I should have checked out. It makes sense now because the back pain begins directly behind that ovary. I figured he would do a biopsy if it were anything I should worryabout. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   I did notice a body odor change around then. Not a permanent one though. It smelled like balls or something Similar. Like a strong almost sweet musky smell I guess. My periods are absolutely insanely heavy and I have two a month at times. I started feeling full faster.  I started to lose my sex drive. My moods are unpredictable.  My boobs would get large lumps in them around my period but they no longer do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was eventually diagnosed with leukocytosis with an unspecified origin. What did happen is mu bp all of the sudden became insanely high. I domt know how I'm alive really. Last one read as 202/189 and that was finally lowered to 179/120 after they made me stay a while on the heart monitor. It continues to this day in those numbers. I am prescribed lisinopril.  I noticed the back pain was coming back after a few months of almost no pain. I also got really sick for only a few hours out of nowhere about 2 weeks ago. Around 4 days ago I felt something that seemed to \"drop\" or \"get stuck\" inside of my body but in between my inner and outter labia if they were inside of my body. I figured a possible kidney stone but no blood and I never passed it. Since that I've noticed that I feel as if I have a rock sitting on my cervix. That has given way to a more concentrated area of pain. The left side of my pelvis. Directly in front of the swollen  now larger area on my back that has been bothering me for so long. If I sit down it feels as if my organs are being pushed by whatever it is. When I poop it feels like I'm giving birth. Not from being constipated (I'm actually regular and soft) but from the pressure and pain. As if I'm pushing on it when I have a bowl movement. So I feels like maybe it's sitting on my rectum or something and the bowls force it out of the way. I have been bloated. I also feel as if I've gained so much weight but the scale says otherwise. It's not time for my period and no cramps. Like I said earlier, no blood. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  I went to the med stop  to find out what it is all meaning. The usual high BP, pulse 101, and 98.7F temp. No signs of a uti or bladder infection based on the urine sample. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther random ailments include tenderness all over abdomen and diaraghm. On the right diaphragm area under my ribs, I have felt this intense tightness that feels like a baby does when they move around except it's not a baby. Sometimes if I apply pressure to that area either posterior or anterior, it's like a relief. Same with the muscles along my spine at times. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   Right now my back is just on fire. It's so much to deal with. I have a referral to see a gyn but who knows how long it will take to get an appointment.  I have a bi annual check up with my oncologist next month on the 22. I'm starting to become concerned that this may actually be more than just me trying to put something from web md in my mental diagnosis check box.

Did I tear something?", "author": "nosilla17", "self_text": "21 y/o, 5\u20196, 135 lb white female. I am in the US. I have never had any issues with my shoulder before. I routinely run and lift weights.  Taking naproxen sodium  for pain. During a fitness test, I was required to do pull-ups. I did two with no problem, but on the third one, when I came down from the bar, I heard a large cracking sound. It didn\u2019t feel like anything cracked but it did hurt quite a bit. When I attempted to pull back up to the bar, it felt like my shoulder was out of place. After I got off the bar it felt extremely sore but no longer out of place. Now, it has a dull pain that grows into a sharp one when I move my arm either behind my back or rotate my thumb down and press it in towards my chest. Also when I\u2019m attempting to take my shirt off. I\u2019m going to see a doctor soon, but was wondering if anyone has experienced something similar in case it\u2019s nothing serious.

I general I am pretty healthy, I am into fitness, only drink socially (do not do drugs), and have a pretty healthy diet.\n\nI stopped taking Cipro one month weeks ago. I was prescribed Ciprofloxacin (2 pills a day for a week) for a suspected bacteria in my stomach/bowels (I have had loose stools, gas, and an upset stomach for weeks) which is I think is because of unrefrigerated food that I ate.\n\nI took a total of 4 pills and decided to stop (my joints ached and felt woozy), the following day I felt much worse. I could barley walk (it felt that I was at risk of rupturing my achilles tendon with every step, and joints throughout my body ached). While I have improved since I stopped taking it, it still hurts when I walk and I feel like in may be a while before I can run again.\n\nDoes anyone know why Cipro causes this and what is happening? I am pretty worried as I read some scary stuff on some very very bad reactions to \"being floxed\" and it feels like that may have just happened to me. I am trying to stay positive but would like to know what I can do to recover as quickly as possible.\n\nWould appreciate any advice/insight from anyone in the Medical Community or others that have went through this.\n\nThank you", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}
