It also easily gets very dry during the day, which is highly unusual for me (I never have dehydration problems).

{"post_id": "ckkrch", "created_utc": 1564641985, "title": "Pelvic Issue (Long)", "author": "PoppedLockednDropped", "self_text": "A lot has happened and is going on so I'll try and keep this post as concise and organized as I can with the relevant info. I'm a 23 year old male, 170lbs 6 foot 2 which was otherwise in above average physical health when symptoms started. I know all at once this will be confusing so I'll get to where doctors and I have gotten to now.  I have been all over the place trying to get this issue fixed for about 3 years with the more serious symptoms happening in the past 1 - 1.5 years but imaging has ruled out anything serious from my brain, spine, and shoulders. I have never had my pelvis, legs, or abdominal area imaged. So far the cause has pretty much been narrowed down to my pelvic area but I still don't have a diagnosis. I'll describe everything I feel, list surgeries, what provides relief, doctors I've seen, lifestyle, imaging/tests I've had done Symptoms and pictures. Right now we are focused on my pelvis as that is where the most doctors and PTs have said is the root cause and I would say feels right. My general physician who I have been with since maybe 2002 thinks it could be a rupture somewhere or nerve entrapment somewhere in my pelvis. I saw him last Friday where I updated him on everything that had been going on. He checked my left hernia site and said it felt like I may have ruptured something after finding the area \"not smooth\" (poked his finger up my scrotum to feel the site) and that that is weird for my age. Personally the entire area feels different to me and I no longer feel that push down from my muscles when doing the cough test for a hernia. I have been going to a physical therapy office where there are four different specialists I have been working with. One found that my sacrum seems to be out of place. Everything else I feel has been for the most part imaged and cleared of any serious issue.\n\n# Overall Symptoms:\n\nGallery\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/5zz1j4ax8sd31.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zz7mvjax8sd31.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/44cqwdax8sd31.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/mpbqjdax8sd31.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/6opvadax8sd31.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/nbtmudax8sd31.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/bgmigkax8sd31.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/9c54iuax8sd31.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/danjskax8sd31.jpg\n\n**Arm/shoulder:**\n\n* Overhead movements feel wrong, lifting overhand with my left side sucks. Feels like I have less support from muscles in my lats and upper back and makes lifting overall too difficult to do.\n* I feel pain in my left elbow where the ulnar nerve is. Like a sharp achy feeling similar an inflamed feeling that I also feel on the pinky side of my wrist before the line of my hand. Sometimes my pinky and ring finger will go cold while the other two stay warm. My physical therapists thinks it's like an intermittent thoracic outlet syndrome.\n* When I was still working out one of the first symptoms was noticing that my left lat wasn't participating as much as it had before and had overall weakness and feeling of impingement in my shoulder when doing any overhead movements. Basically pullups no longer felt right and I stopped progressing on push exercises.\n\n**Abdominal/Chest:**\n\n* Left side of my rib cage is slightly flared, with tightness in my upper left chest\n* Left lower ribs make clicking noises when leaning forwards or sideways\n* Left abs no longer feel stable\n* Sternum can now crack when before I never could\n* I can't twist and crack my back if I twist to the left\n\n**Neck/Head:**\n\n* Vision feels like its at a constant 90%, almost like its hard to focus or track with my eyes. Like they cant relax.\n* Any anxiety I feel is as a result of the onset of the suboccipital tightness and overall foggy feeling in my head. The first doctor I saw on referral was a therapist because I was told it was just anxiety. I stayed with him for three months before he cleared me saying I was mentally fine albeit stressed. When the onset of the neck feeling happened, I had been bridging and felt a pop somewhere in my pelvic area and I immediately started having panic attack like symptoms. I had a handful more before I learned to recognize the symptoms and that they were produced by my issue not stress. I have never had anxiety prior to the overall issue and always dealt very well with stress.\n* I have a constant suboccipital tension, feeling like my neck is tense and being twisted but deep inside.\n* All the muscles of the front of my neck have weakened and scalenes are now super tight (noticed by the PT)\n* The muscles on the left side of my face and skull often feel weird and I sense movement and flexion. Massaging the muscles on thee right side of my skull sometimes eases the muscles. One of my PTs has said that she noticed the muscles in my face both look and feel uneven with the left side having a slight pulled down look and I feel that. The muscles between my left and right jaw feel wrong and very weak. Like my tongue is resting in mid air almost. When looking up the muscles of the front of my neck feel wrong and too tight. Often movement of my neck produces popping like my trachea is pushing past muscles.\n* Trouble swallowing and breathing. When my lungs are full it feels easier to swallow. My throat muscles in general feel weird.\n* My PTs have pretty much all said that by SNS system is in overdrive but to me it feels like whatever this is causes that\n* One of the PTs have also noticed that my diaphragm on my left side isn't doing much and it definitely feels like it. If I go for a run and focus on keeping my pelvis and legs even I can feel it start to activate and stops when I don't get it just right\n* TMJ issues\n\n**Legs/Pelvis**\n\n* Overall the muscles of left leg feel wrong and out of place like my left pelvis is being pushed backwards and up which has made my upper quads pretty much useless\n* When moving my leg around I feel a lot of popping and crunch/multiple pop feeling like ligaments running over a bump on my inner thigh where it connects to my pelvis, around my sitbone, and on the outside of my leg\n* Sports Medicine Ortho has noticed that when holding my quad down in a supine position I can't lift my leg straight up. Like my legs aren't receiving the signal.\n* When sitting my sit bones feel very out of place\n* When sitting against a hard seat like on the train its accentuated and I feel my spine or pelvis pushing into the back of the seat\n* When I would do leg presses it felt like I couldn't hold my left pelvis in place in turn making it feel like it would push backwards into the seat\n* When stepping if I put to much weight over the area under my pinky toe knuckle it hurts in a sharp bruised kind of way\n* Circulation to feet sucks\n* Foot drop left side\n* Sometimes get streaks of cold down my shins and a gurgly feeling in the arch of my foot near the big toe\n* Started getting flat foot on my left side\n* Knee troubles\n* Tingly feeling at the top of my leg near the anterior superior iliac spine\n* Big indent above penis easier felt than seen\n* There is pain in my inner left thigh where I feel a tight thin band. The muscles in that same area feel\n* Feels like my hamstring on my left side doesn't flex. When palpating I fee, really tight lines of muscle.\n* feels like the muscles below my waist all the way to my penis are all not doing anything. I can't flex them anymore hence the lack of pushing feeling during the hernia cough test. The muscles look wrong to me and lumpy? I'm pretty numb on most of the left side.\n* Sitting on the toilet sometimes brings on the worst of the overall tension and dizzy confused feeling. My heart will race and it feels almost like what the symptoms of high blood pressure feel like.\n* I have a swollen feeling in my perineum\n* I fart a lot more now and feel a lot of squelching in the front of my pelvis and back near my tailbone\n* When hanging in a pull and/or chin up position and relaxing, it feels like the front of my left waist gets caught or hitched on itself and won't expand relax like on the right side causing my arm to start to go numb as the upper back muscles on my left side do nothing to help.\n* When feeling out the back of my pelvis there is much more space between my spine and right pelvis than on the left and the left side feels very bumpy right is smooth. The spot where my buttcrack starts feels wrong and has an indent.\n\n# What Gives Me Relief\n\n* What gives me hope is that every single symptom I've listed has gone away twice while doing the exact same stretch but I've got maybe a 1% success rate. The first time it happened by accident in the gym while sitting at the edge of a bench with my legs flexed and together(this doesn't ever feel as it should but this time it felt like the muscles were all weakly holding their place), heels up on the rolling part. I was holding two 20lbs and leaned forward over my legs in this position with my chin tucked and I held it while I tried to find a comfortable grip. I started to get a releasing feeling in my back and suddenly in like a chain reaction I felt my lower back and shoulder chunk into place and suddenly everything I was feeling went away for like a minute then right back. The second time I was trying to recreate this and suddenly got it just right and felt the skin of my lower back relax and it traveled up my spine and everything slipped back again. It felt like my entire left side suddenly took a big breath. I could breathe clearly, smell better, the dysfunctions all went away and I felt the muscles in the occipital area tighten up and suddenly I could see clearly and consistently again. After about 5 minutes it all went back to symptomatic.\n* Holding a wedge between my inner thighs that is more tube in shape while I stand helps\n* When sitting if I wedge under my left thigh closer to the upper middle part there are a lot of tight bands and it releases some of the tension and I swear when it's just right clears up my vision as well.\n\n# Lifestyle:\n\nI now sit a lot during the day. For the past 2+ years I have worked office jobs and have been a student full-time since the issue started. From 2014-2018 I worked out lifting weights 4-6 times a week which is where I had noticed the onset of issues after about a year without any. I stopped working out entirely this past winter after symptoms became too much and my left abs no longer felt stable enough for me to work out without fear of injury. I don't have a car and walk pretty much everywhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# MRIs/Findings:\n\nXrays (probably shitty, were done at a chiropracter a few weeks ago.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/z15s5gz8asd31.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/wzjqafz8asd31.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ppfu6fz8asd31.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/bhbhpfz8asd31.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/cxzfykz8asd31.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zuyn1gz8asd31.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ihanmhz8asd31.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/haprbfz8asd31.png\n\n* Cervical MRI\n\nImpression: Study limited by mild motion artifact. Grossly there is minimal annular bulge at C5-C6 without evidence of disc protrusion or spinal stenosis.\n\nNarrative\n\nClinical history: Neck pain.Noncontrast multiplanar MRI imaging of the lumbar spine was performed. Examination is limited due to mild motion artifact on the axial T1-weighted and T2-weighted images. Grossly no evidence of extrinsic compression of the cervical spinal cord and no evidence of T2-weighted signal normality within the cord is seen. There is straightening of the normal cervical lordosis which may be positional in nature or related to muscle spasm. Minimal annular bulge is present at C5-C6. No evidence of disc protrusion or spinal stenosis is seen. On the axial images there is moderate symmetric prominence of the palatine tonsillar soft tissues with mild-to-moderate narrowing of the adjacent airway.\n\n* Lumbar Spine MRI\n\nIMPRESSION: No evidence of focal disc herniation, central stenosis, or neural foraminal narrowing in the lumbar spine.\n\n## Narrative\n\nCLINICAL HISTORY: Back painTECHNIQUE:Noncontrast lumbar spine MRICOMPARISON: Radiographs lumbar spine 12/17/18FINDINGS: Straightening of the lumbar curvature loss of normal lordosis. Congenitally short pedicles with a baseline narrow canal.The lowest completely formed disc is labeled as S1-S2 for reference (image 44 series 6 corresponds S1-S2 disc). There is a transitional S1 anatomy.Visualized lower thoracic cord and conus are unremarkable.T12-L1, L1-L2 L2-L3, L3-L4, L4-L5: UnremarkableL5-S1: Minimal loss of disc height with desiccated disc signal. No central stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing. Trace disc bulge.S1-S2: Unremarkable\n\n* I have an EMG of the inguinal area in a couple weeks. I'll take any suggestions on what to tell them when I'm there.\n* Hip arthrogram came back clean, no labral tear\n\n# Doctors:\n\nMost doctors didn't do much of anything besides simple reflex tests to check anything. The general doctor that has known me the longest as well as the physical therapist office I currently go to have been the only ones to really use their hands and palpate around or even take more than 5 minutes to check me out. Subsequently they have had the most findings. But since this started I have seen a myriad of doctors where I mostly confused them because I sound all over the place and feels things everywhere. Over time it has helped to narrow things down and the pelvis thesis which we've only started following in the past couple months.\n\n* 4 chiropractors\n* 2 Orthopedic Surgeons\n* Cervical Surgeon\n* Neurologist\n* Neuromuscular\n* 5 Physical Therapists (4 same place)\n* Jaw Surgeon\n* General Surgeon\n* Talk Therapist\n\n# Medical History:\n\n* Right Inguinal Hernia Repair - No Mesh (2008)\n* Left Inguinal Hernia Repair - No Mesh (2009) Same surgeon as 2008 repair and possibly the start of my issues. This one I badly hurt myself post-op the next morning. I felt so good after this one that I was walking around and feeling 100% almost right after the surgery. So good that the next morning I had completely forgotten in my usual morning haze and extended my left leg with a hard morning stretch because I felt I needed to. Needless to say this was a horrible idea and to this day was the most horrible pain I've felt. It was a sharp stabbing pain with a burning stretching feeling that felt like I was being electrocuted down my leg all at the same time. After a few minutes I caught my breath and checked under the bandage expecting a bloodbath and it looked fine. But ever since then my inner thigh up where it meets the pelvis and general hernia repair surgery has been numb. Like can't feel an icepack numb. Later when doing mixed martial arts (2011-2014 with no issue like what I feel now) I would sometimes get a reminder of a feeling when I stretched my left leg too far to the outside.A few weeks ago a pelvic physical therapist was doing dry needling of the pectineus and surrounding erectors when she reproduced the burning electrical feeling which I felt before. I felt it in my inguinal area/inner thigh, right above my knee, and above my foot where it bends. Afterwards it provided a bit of relief and released some of the tension in my chest letting me breathe a bit better and was a bit more comfortable to walk after some of the tension released in my legs.\n* Other than my surgeries my medical record is pretty much spotless outside of 5 years of braces. Never had any type of issue with anything and enjoyed full use of everything outside of the hernias.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this is a lot but this bothers me every second and I've seen a lot of doctors. Having seen full relief twice it gives me hopes and let's me at least know it's not in my head. Posting here is a long shot but I'm looking for any and all direction/ideas. Anything anyone can add would be greatly appreciated and I'm happy to answer any questions.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Tests keep coming back normal.", "author": "arosemind", "self_text": "**Age:** 24 **Sex:** F **Height:** 5'5 **Weight:** 135 **Race:** White **Duration of complaint:** Since late April 2019 **Geographic location:** Florida **Body location:** Left leg **Medical issues:** Urinary issues (working on it with a urologist), previous diagnosis of Fibromyalgia **Medication:** Oxybutynin 10 mg **Smoking:** No **Work:** Desk job **Activity level**: Mostly sedentary due to pain, but I take walks and practice yoga when I can\n\nHiya. I've been having some intense, ongoing pain and discomfort in my left leg since late April. I am seeing doctors for this (as my story will indicate) but I'm hoping that someone here might be able to give me an idea of what to look out for.\n\nTLDR is at the bottom but I would appreciate it if you could read the whole thing. Photos are at the bottom as well.\n\nI started feeling sharp, shocking pains in my left leg's calf every 30 minutes to an hour. I haven't felt anything like it before in my life. The pain is so intense I could cry. It comes randomly and nothing triggers it but it is consistent, although it doesn't happen as frequently as it did in April/May.\n\nThen I started feeling weakness, tightness and heaviness in the same leg and noticed swelling (it is most noticeable in the back of my knee, and small veins are more visible there as well - you can see this in the photos below) and thickness all over. It aches and it is very sensitive. When it's touched, it feels like whatever's touching it could push right through my leg. I sometimes feel a sensation like something is trying to come out of my leg, like pressing or pushing. My left leg is redder than my right leg and it looks like the skin is more translucent as well. I also sometimes feel a pain in the back of my knee where it bends. As I mentioned before, I see that a vein is more pronounced and this is around the area where the pain is.\n\nMore recently, I've noticed that parts of my leg will feel like there's water on it but it always ends up being completely dry. My left foot is similarly sensitive and I often feel a random tingly feeling. I sometimes see pitting in my leg/foot when I accidentally put too much pressure on it. Moving my leg/foot doesn't help and keeping it still doesn't help. I can't walk or sit comfortably and I only feel a tiny bit of relief when I am laying down. All of these symptoms with the exception of the sharp, shocking pain (which is limited to my calf and less frequent than it used to be) and the vein pain (which is infrequent but enough to be a concern) are felt all the time and all over my leg.\n\nI didn't realize it until later, but a couple of weeks prior to this pain starting, I felt weakness in my legs and feet and had trouble standing up from the couch after sitting there for short periods of time. I almost fell down a couple of times. I believe it went away shortly after a week or so but I remember being concerned about it. I'm not experiencing it currently.\n\nI should add that I was in a car accident a few years ago and I had leg and knee pain in the same knee as well as a hematoma in my left side (where I now have consistent sharp pains as well - mostly when I sleep on it or move the wrong way, though not as often anymore). I had MRIs that came back normal and physical therapy for a few months but nothing that the orthopedic doctor at the time could diagnose. I don't think that this is related since I didn't have any calf pain or pain of this kind at the time at all but I figured it's worth mentioning here.\n\nI went to the ER the day after I first started feeling the sharp pain to check if it was DVT. I had a venous ultrasound, an x-ray and a blood test that all came back negative for DVT or any kind of insufficiency. I went to my PCP a week later and she suggested going to an orthopedic doctor and a neurologist. While I waited for my appointments to come up, I had an MRI of my left knee, my lumbar spine and my calf - all negative. Then I had an arterial ultrasound on my leg and an echocardiogram to see if it was related to my heart - also all fine according to the radiologist. However, the woman performing the ultrasound on my leg quickly did another venous ultrasound on certain areas of my leg because DVT can show up later on (it apparently didn't this time), and she mentioned to me that she could see a dilated vein and that it could be related to varicose veins. I brought this up to my PCP and she is in the process of referring me to a vascular surgeon.\n\nI finally went to the orthopedic doctor and he said that since everything came back normal, it didn't seem like I have anything \"structurally wrong with me\". He mentioned that one of his previous patients complained of similar symptoms and everything came back normal but that they later found out it was multiple sclerosis. He suggested that I work on my symptoms more with the neurologist.\n\nI went to the neurologist and after discussing possible things it could be like compartment syndrome or a baker\u2019s cyst, he said that he'd do an EMG nerve test. Fast forward a few weeks and I have the test. WOW, that was not fun. The majority of it was just uncomfortable but when he did the test on my calf where my shocking pain and pushing sensations are, I felt like my leg was going to explode - it really amplified the pushing sensation. The marks from the needles are still very visible in my skin, maybe related to the pitting I mentioned previously? Once the test was over, the neurologist said that it all came back normal and I don't have any nerve damage, which is what the test was evaluating. I told him what the orthopedic doctor said about multiple sclerosis and he said that while he isn't a multiple sclerosis specialist, he doesn't feel that it's necessary to have me get a brain scan (which I had for headaches three years ago and it was clean). He said to move forward with the orthopedic doctor (despite the orthopedic doctor saying the opposite and basically discharging me during my last visit) and the vascular surgeon.

I almost always get lightheaded and blurry vision when getting up at any time but it will go away after about 10 or 15 seconds.

I woke up and was sitting on the ground next to my shower, my whole body aching, enough to evoke an audible noise from myself ( note I have never fainted before).

I went to doctors, neurologist, kinesi therapist and chiropractors to help battle this problem. I tried basically everything except surgery ( and it was never suggested by any of those professionals ) . Diagnosis went from nerve damage to spine damage to brain damage to diet issues and non of the treatment worked. For treatment I tried pills, therapy, stretching , exercising, dieting, chiropractor adjustments and combinations of all of those things. Again I point out none of it worked. About an year and a half ago I discovered a clip for anxiety relief. It was a yoga practice for alternate nostril breathing. You breath from one nostril and exhale from the other then switch and you do this for about 5 minutes. Breathing only through my right nostril I noticed something. My inflammatory sensation decreased right away and it felt amazing but it returned like 1-2 hours after. I had a septum deviation in said nostril and I though maybe my blood circulation in the right side of the body was just bad and that's why I had all those problems. Problem was that circulation as I discovered didn't work like that and it didn't matter if the air was coming from one or the other nostril. Yet I saw some studies that with right nostril breathing you inhale more oxygen. Still it was the only thing that was working so I decided to make the deviation fix surgery. It went ok - it didn't completely fix it but it was definitely better. And as I suspected the inflammatory problems decreased... for about 4 months. It all returned after. Somehow my deviation started to return too and I was noticing decreased oxygen again. About 2 months ago I started informing myself again and started doing the right nostril breathing again, but hey I can't do it all day and then I saw the nostril cycle clip again and though what if my sleeping position was the problem. I never though of it before but I always sleep with my right side of the face downward to the pillow. So when you sleep like this the nostril cycle disrupts and is always focused on the opposite nostril. So if you sleep on your right side the left nostril is the one that is functional. That's all night every day FOR YEARS. So the fix was simply train yourself to sleep on the left side. First week was very hard and I clocked in bout 2-3 hours of deep sleep per night ( have a fitness band that measured this ) .I know that when you sleep your body changes position at least 10 times a night but in my case they were almost all on my right side laying on the pillow. I recorded myself with a phone 2 times to check if my position switched . That was the 2 days before me trying to sleep on the left side. But now 2 months later my deviation started to decrease on its own (ether that or just somehow my oxygen intake increased through my right nostril) . Inflammation is almost gone and exercising and stretching is now actually working. I still don't know why a nostril can cause all this but it's what fixed me. It worked but I don't know why since according to the studies it shouldn't matter all that much which side you sleep on or which nostril you breath from. Any thoughts?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

It first happened in between December 2017 and January 2018.\n\n**Location**: Portugal, Head and whole body\n\n**Any existing relevant medical issues:** Schizophrenia(Diagnosed in May 2018), Tinnitus(I got it recently, last Friday)\n\n**Current medications:** Haldol Injections (since July 2018)\n\n**Description of the symptom:** This started during a psychotic breakdown, at the time I was undiagnosed. I recall that I was thinking about spitting on the floor(for some reason) when a man snored loudly. I felt an odd, very painfull sensation in my head. At the same time, I proceeded to spit on the floor, without the intention of doing so. It very much felt like my body was doing it by himself. I recall the sensation of electricity flowing through my body, but I am unsure of this memory for some reason. Later, when I was studying, the same thing happened, but less intense pain, some loud sound, then a painful sensation while my fingers scrolled down the pdf I was reading. I had no intention to do so, I was reading a paragraph and had no need to scroll down.\n\nThe involuntary movements/behavior did not happen again, however, the sensations still remain. They are triggered by certain sounds, usually coughing, sneezing and snoring. Other sounds that have the same quality can also trigger these sensations.\n\nThe more I put stress on my mind(studying, thinking about a hard subject, etc), the more sensitive I become to these sounds. As I put strain on my mind, they first just start to bother me a little, then I start having irrational emotional reactions and then it culminates in pain. Sometimes the pain is enough to stun me, I stay put, unresponsive, looking in front of me at nothing.\n\nI've been avoiding experiencing them by staying in my room, rarely leaving the house and rarely studying. Tried to find a way to avoid the sounds by using earplugs and headphones with a loud white noise, got tinnitus because of it. When I can predict that the sound is going to happen, I can block it by flexing those muscles inside my ears that make a rumbling noise. This is effective, but I rarely get the opportunity to take advantage of this strategy.\n\nThe doctor tells me to speak with the psychiatrist about it, but my psychiatrist tells me to speak with the doctor. Neither gave me the opportunity to fully explain the situation. I would like to have a general idea of what this could be, and which kind of specialist I should consult. Please help me, this is ruining my life.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

This has been going on since I started being sexually active a few years ago. So I have been very careful to always pee. Occasionally however I will forget(about once a year). \n\nTwo weeks ago I got a UTI, was put on antibiotics for it for 5 days (Nitrofurantoin). Nothing severe - blood in urine, a little smelly, needing to pee but only a little coming out and a burning sensation when peeing. After three days the symptoms cleared up. I finished the full 5 days. \n\nThree days after that however, the symptoms came back. I woke up with burning when peeing,  blood and flakes in pee. I wouldn\u2019t be able to see a doctor for a few days so I decided to wait it out. Starting that day I drank a ton of water and went to the bathroom as much as possible and as the day progressed my symptoms would slowly get better. Then I would wake up and would get the same symptoms and would do it again - drink a ton of water and symptoms would faze out. This lasted three days. On the forth day (today) I woke up and it seemed as though my symptoms were no longer there - the only thing I kind of felt was a slight full feeling in the bladder. This was also the day I went to see my doctor. I explained my symptoms and he prescribed the same antibiotics but for 7 days instead of 5. \n\nHere is my question: I have read a ton online that said UTIs can sometimes clear on their own . Could it be possible that this happened? My symptoms defiantly came back after that 5 day antibiotics treatment but I\u2019m thinking me drinking all that water when it happened may have just diluted the pee making me not feel any discomfort? I\u2019m scared that taking another round of antibiotics will cause more harm than good. But then again even if it\u2019s just a small bit of bacteria left it would be better to kill it off?\nI\u2019m staying away from sexual intercourse for at least a month to be extra safe.\n\nTl;dr:\nhad a UTI \u2014&gt; it cleared up after 5 days of antibiotics\u2014&gt; it came back after 3 days \u2014&gt; I drank a ton of water and seemed to have flushed it out in 3 days w/o antibiotics\u2014&gt; Saw a doctor again now I\u2019m on 7 days of antibiotics \nScared this will cause more hard then good ie Bacteria will become more resistant in the future", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I was nauseous and confused, but as sound and vision went away, I just felt calm. \n\nMy partner heard me mumbling and came to check on me. She said my eyes fluttered/rolled back, then I slumped off the toilet. I was sitting bare-assed in vomit. I wasn\u2019t conscious for this, but she said my mouth was locked shut. Like I refused to open it. She pried my mouth open, reached down my throat and clawed the vomit out.

I'm experiencing a real annoying problem for about 6 months now. It started with a red area around my anus and it was also itching a lot. I went to the doctor with it and he prescribed me an anti-fungal cream: it helped and the symptoms were gone. \n\nThe other things I started to notice were that my penis was very dry and also had a really bad smell coming off of it. On top of that, I had a bad smell coming from my breath and it almost had the same smell as from my penis. I didn't think the smell in my mouth would be that important so I only went to the doctor for my penis at that moment. He prescribed a number of anti-fungal creams and also Vaseline. The moments that the anti-fungal creams were applied, the problem seemed to be solved, but if I stopped for one day it would be back immediately. Then I started with apple cider vinegar: drinking 2 tablespoons mixed with water twice a day for two weeks and pouring apple cider vinegar over my penis twice a day for a week. After this the problems were completely gone, in the meantime I use Vaseline about twice a week. Incidentally, the stink breath also went away because of the apple vinegar.  \n\nNow 3 weeks after having stopped drinking apple cider vinegar, some of the symptoms are back. My stink breath and the stench of my penis are what it was again, on top of that I'm getting the itch back around my anus (mostly the are between my buttcheeks). The drought has not returned: this may be related to the fact that I apply Vaseline twice a week. I also went to the dermatologist, who indicated that it was about eczema, but that appears not to be the case since the apple cider vinegar stopped the symptoms from both my breath and my penis.  Could it be that I have a fungus that is hidden deep in my body? That apple cider vinegar prevented it but is not enough to wipe it out completely?

I just came back home from college and I was doing alright. My food intake was normal and my diet(while not the healthiest) was normal as well. Around June I started experiencing abdominal pain that was in the lower right side. This became a constant pain that worsened when I ate food. I have also been experiencing diarrhea no matter what food I ate. At first doctors were worried that I had appendicitis. \n\nThey checked my appendix with an ultrasound and it was all good. They then gave me some NSAID IV med that helped a little bit but I sorta lied to the doc at the ER that I was doing better because I was not missing my sister\u2019s and my Dad\u2019s graduation. \n\nThen rolled around July and this pain and diarrhea hasn\u2019t let up and Tylenol isn\u2019t touching it. So by that point my pain out of 1-10 was nearing a 9. \n\nI haven\u2019t explained the pain yet. It\u2019s basically constant cramping. \n\nSo then I visit my GI doctor to explain what\u2019s been going on. She then gives me a Hemoccult blood test just to see if there was any blood in my stool. That test came back positive which triggered my doc to order an Endoscopy and Colonoscopy.\n\nOf course I was under anesthesia so I remember hardly anything but my mom said that they visually saw that the ileum of my small intestine was visually inflamed and that the doctor who did the scope was concerned with me maybe having IBD, likely Crohn\u2019s Disease. In fact they perfectly understood why I haven\u2019t been eating like my usually and they didn\u2019t make me eat a small snack afterward unlike the other patients.\n\nBy this point my diet was Gatorade and Water.\n\nWeirdly and Surprisingly the biopsies came back normal. \n\nBut I was still experiencing this pain. So we go back to the ER and they admit me, this time inserting a feeding tube because throughout all of this I have lost 20 pounds. The formula they give me has no other ingredients besides straight nutrients and I was still dealing with diarrhea and this cramping pain. \n\nThey then test something called fecal calprotectin which is a marker for IBD. The normal range for that is 0-50, the borderline is 50-120, and abnormal is &amp;gt;120.\n\nI was 116 and so they said it wasn\u2019t as high as they expected. \n\nSo after 5 days of being fed from the tube, they said they have run every test and came up with the conclusion that I have IBS-D. \n\nHere\u2019s where I have a question, does this this seem consistent with a diagnosis of IBS or does it seem to be something else?\n\nThey gave me Levsin and Imodium to help but that hasn\u2019t solved my pain.\n\nIt has been emotionally very hard because right now literally everything I eat is painful. \n\nTL:DR Went the the hospital multiple times because of abdominal pain, diarrhea and 20 pounds weight loss in a month. Eating worsens the cramping pain. \nIs constant cramping a symptom of IBS?\n\nHere\u2019s the stool tests they have done:\n\n- a stool culture for any bacterial/viral : negative\n- a ova and parasite test : negative\n- C diff : negative\n- fecal calprotectin: 116, called it borderline\n\nNo Salmonella, no E.coli none of those\n\nGenerally I\u2019m a healthy guy but my immune system has always been shot. It takes quite a bit of work to keep my immune system under control. They were originally concerned I was having an allergic reaction but what they fed me through the tube was straight nutrients and nothing else. Still dealt with all the same symptoms. Also yes scared of eating but my desires to eat is still there.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

{"post_id": "cmq8aw", "created_utc": 1565096151, "title": "Permanent muscle tenseness", "author": "none_will_know", "self_text": "Hello everyone!\n\nI am new here and hoping this gets posted.\n\nInformation as per rules: female, 32, 159 cm, 55 kg, European (ethnicity) living in Germany. Everything else below.\n\nI have been constantly doing sports for the last 13 years. My sport - climbing - is the love of my life and very important to me. I have been making good progress for the first maybe 5 years of climbing, and the last like 8 years I have been making pretty much zero progress. I have tried everything I could and finally came to the conclusion that the main thing that stops me is my permanent muscle tenseness. Yes, it's weird that it took me so long to figure it out, but I'm always first blaming myself for doing something wrong and only then searching for other factors.\n\nBasically, most of my muscles are tense 100% of the time. It's easy to tell by touching them, they are hard to the touch (some more, some less). I couldn't tell before since I kinda never compared this to other people. I get up every day and feel like I've been run over by a car or like I've exercised the day before for the first time in 10 years, even if I did absolutely zero sport. Every single day. During the day I will always feel the muscles to be tired, like after a really thorough workout after a big break, but I workout 4-5 times per week and do the same things all the time. I thought I should just work out less, but no, no change there.\n\nAny sort of massage is very painful and changes nothing. I have those foam rollers (\"black roll\") - just putting, say, my calf on a roller without putting any pressure is really painful. Any sort of relaxation techniques - progressive muscle relaxation, just going to a sauna - don't help in the slightest. I don't control any part of this.\n\nI have recently found a doctor who seemed to be very knowledgeable about all this, he has a lot of experience with climbers specifically on a world level (national team athletes). So I had a full X-ray of my spine and a very specific blood test.\n\nTurns out my spine is all zig-zag-like, I have then received specific exercises from the doctor to activate the muscles that were not working in my case. I can see the progress with the exercises but no changes with my condition.\n\nI am also lacking a lot of microelements in my blood like kalium that are supposed to help muscles relax. I have received a detailed plan from my doctor what vitamins and supplements I should take to balance it all out, that was supposed to help, but after 3.5 months of this I am still not noticing any difference.\n\nI have recently had a lot of pain in the right side of my back due to even more muscle blocks, so another doctor prescribed me medicine (Ortoton) for muscle relaxation, did not help at all (consumed the whole package in prescribed doses). Another similar medicine was prescribed (Sirdalud), a small dose does nothing to me, a big one just makes me extremely tired, no muscle relaxation at all.\n\nJust as a side note, I also look very muscular (I've never consumed any supplements for that), I think it comes from my dad whose legs look muscular even though he has a pretty sedentary lifestyle with occasional travels. I also don't think I can list any other medical issues I have that are related to this, only maybe also this fact: I am a person who easily stresses over everything, so I can call myself permanently stressed, but it's psychological, and I'm working on it.\n\nSo, I'm at my wit's end, and so is my doctor. I am 99% sure that if I don't solve this, I will never have more progress in climbing, since the muscles just can't get stronger anymore because they don't rest. Climbing is really the thing that makes me most happy, and progress is extremely important to me. Also, it makes my life hard since it's painful every day.\n\nAny ideas here would be very appreciated. Thanks a lot in advance. I'm not losing hope yet.\n\n(edit to include more information as per rules)", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I've hit a wall talking with my Neuro MDS and have also gotten second opinions. There are just some details that bother me that have not been addressed well and I'm looking for some feedback. I'm a healthcare professional, so I do think I have valid concerns and questions.\n\nTo get to the core quickly, I'll lay out the basics/obvious. I have a resting right sided tremor, it is a stereotypical \"pill rolling\" (wrist flexion/extension and 1st knuckle flexion/extension). It can be pretty strong at times. I also have some bradykinesia, so my gross/fine motor skills are affected, both with my right upper and lower extremities. I've also had a positive DAT scan, and a negative MRI (IIRC with and without contrast). So, pretty straightforward it seems.\n\nThe sticking points: (trying to keep these brief, sorry!)\n\nWhen I had my DAT scan, I was not told to DC my bupropion, which is shown to affect the test and can cause \n\nfalse-positives. There  has been some debate amung my neurologists regarding validity of the test.\n\nMy MRI was taken very early after my symptoms onset. Not sure how much that changes.\n\nI've experienced fasiculations essentially all over my body. Not a tremor, a true fasiculation. They do not often repeat, and are bilateral and central.\n\nWhen I started taking azilect, I tolerated it well at first. However I started to develop severe arthralgia. As in, so bad I could only stand for \\~15 minutes, and sleep was extremely difficult. This prompted me to see a rheumatologist, where they found significant inflamatory markers and a + HLAB27 marker, but physically they did not find any changes to support a formal ankylosing spondlitis diagnosis. However, MRIs did show some Right sided C6-7 stenosis. The orthopedist I saw asked if I had ever been in a car accident due to the cervical spine damage (I have not), but he still maintained that none of my symptoms were related since the EMG was negative.\n\nI've had significant pain in my right arm, as well as some muscle wasting in my hand, and strength deficits. It took 3 EMGs to finally detect a fairly significant slowing at my cubital tunnel (37 mS as opposed to the speculated 50 ms for my demographics). The last test administrator basicly said the last 2 people did a crap job. I had surgery on the nerve, and my pain is much better in my right arm, but the wasting is still there.\n\nI've been on amantadine and 4mg ropinirole for, well, years now. Sometimes I miss doses, and it's not clear if my symptoms are worse or not. Unfortunately since I work full time, I'm not receptive to going cold turkey and seeing what happens. I will say though that when I was taking a \"diagnostic doseing\" years ago of Carbadopa/levidopa, I do not feel that there was a difference in any symptoms. My neurologist was nonplussed. Later after I got a new neurologist/MDS, I collected data for fine motor skills (typing tests) by doing a test 2x a day for one minute for \\~ 10 days, and adjusted my ropinirole by 2mg each testing period. The data was not significant from 0 mg to 6mg or even from night to day. That neurologist did not take this data\n\nOn top of that, I strongly feel that I have right sided weakness. Unfortunately most manual muscle testing is pretty basic and relies heavily on experience/technique, so unless it's obviously pathological, you get a 'perfect' score. I do not believe this is a 'freezing'/initiation issue, but this is hard to prove. Every time I go to the gym though, I primarily have right sided delayed onset muscle soreness, and that side often fatigues faster with activities. I also have some mild scapular offset (which occurs with focal weakness). Also, working out typically wrecks me for a good 24+ hours. My syptoms are not worse during or an hour or three after, it's much longer. When I work out on a regular basis my symptoms stay bad prettymuch the whole time.\n\nI've also had predominately unilateral eye irritation/weeping, usually brought on by light or exercise. My opthamologist has no clue.\n\nI also have sensory sensitivity. I hate the heat, it typically makes my symptoms worse. I also have/had vibration sensitivity. It got so bad that I had to get a stelite ganglion block (which helped a lot!). I couldn't use a drill or leaf blower without worsening symptoms and severe arm pain (this was long after my arm surgery).\n\nThe latest issue is my medication. Recently, I started having some focal R knee joint pain. I take 1k MG of a drug called sulfasalazine 2x/day for the 'undifferentiated inflamatory disease'/ankylosing spondylitis. So, I upped my dosage to 1.5k 2x/day. After about 4-5 days, my symptoms improved (tremor, weakness, fine motor skills). I backed off to 1k, they got worse again. My rheumatologist does not believe me.\n\nSo, I'm starting to think this is MS. I could really use some advice as to how I should keep collecting information/talk to my neurologist at my next visit,", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

It's starting to stress me out.", "author": "throwawaytodokete", "self_text": "**Age:** 27\n\n**Gender:** Male\n\n**Race:** Caucasian\n\n**Weight and height:** 98kgs / ~215 pounds. 190 cm / 6'2.\n\n**Duration of complaint:** My whole life.\n\n\nAs the title suggests, I feel hot and start sweating really easily. The sweat itself isn't the problem, but the whole feeling of being \"hot\" and needing colder temperatures. I've always been like this, but I've been noticing it getting worse these last few years.\n\nI can only feel truly comfortable if the temperature is around ~77 \u00baF / 25 \u00baC or lower. Other than that, I start feeling hot. It's specially noticeable when I'm with other people, since I'm the only one feeling hot and needing a fan or an air conditioner nearby. And don't get me started when I'm eating and I start digesting; I turn into a human oven.\n\nI haven't even worn a coat or jacket in winter for years; sometimes it reaches 23 \u00baF / -5 \u00baC in my area and I'm still warm enough with just a hoodie and a T-shirt, and even with that I sometimes sweat and feel hot. I really love winter because of this, since I can really enjoy being outside without feeling hot all the time.\n\nAs most people do, I've looked up online and they usually relate heat sensitivity with **diabetes** and/or **hyperthyroidism**. The thing is don't have diabetes neither I have hyperthyroidism. In fact, I have **subclinical hypothyroidism** (which is under control with no medication, I do regular tests and I'm always on normal levels). They usually relate hypothyroidism with cold sensitivity, which is clearly not the case.\n\nI also attributed this to my weight initially, but I've always felt the same even when I weighted 20 kgs less.\n\nThis is really upsetting because I feel uncomfortable in places where other people are fine. I dislike wearing shirts and suits because I get really heated and I get anxious, since I can't take anything off and the feeling of being hot is really uncomfortable. Even only wearing a shirt is too hot for me in most cases; taking the underground for work or even moving is a guarantee of feeling heated and sweating.\n\nPeople usually joke about me having \"northern genes\", which is partially true: I have very pale skin and clear blue eyes. I get burned easily with little exposure and I tend to get blinded easily by sunlight; I don't mean by looking directly at it, but as soon as it reflects on a white surface like a wall or in a clear pavement I need to close my eyes. I know some part of my ancestry comes from northern Europe and they also share these traits.\n\n\nIs there any way to modify this? Can I \"train\" my body or do anything to change this? Are there any other medical issues or diseases that might be causing this and I'm ignoring?\n\n\nThanks in advance.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

When I tries to go to bed post \u201cattack\u201d i was jolted right before i fell asleep multiple times, and this feeling was almost a panicky feeling like if you think you lost your phone. I should have prefaced this before, but we have been drinking heavily and not getting a ton of sleep. Please, of anyone might have a hunch what this issue/issues is, would you please message me.\n\nThank you in advance for reading this novel. I have done some research on my own and found vertigo, hyperventilation, panic attacks, and high blood pressure as possible suspects. Thanks again.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

So today I felt something weird in my mouth and when I checked saw a round, smooth, clearish/ reddish, painless bump on my inner lower lip.

I immediately washed my mouth out with mouthwash.  Now it is white and slightly raised and still painless.  I've never had this before so I'm a little worried.

For instance, what began as a generic fear of a break-in has now escalated to a crippling obsession with the idea that there would be an intruder in my home. It's not uncommon for me to stay up two or three days in a row because this fear doesn't allow me to sleep.\n\nSimilarly, another fixation I have is the thought of getting into a car wreck (I don't have a license, so this fear is as a passenger, but it's universal; it doesn't matter who the driver of the car is). At times, it gets so bad I feel the need to have my phone camera open and ready to record to have evidence that the hypothetical Other Driver is at fault.\n\nIn both these scenarios, the thought of death or injury is not what frightens me. In fact, I'm rather apathetic in regards to that notion. There is no real reason I'm afraid of these events other than the fact that they are Bad Things That Could Happen.\n\nI have other, more mild fixations such as cleanliness. For example, the other day I was scrubbing the kitchen counter, and after I was finished, my sister put a dirty potted plant down on the counter (with a paper towel as a coaster), and this caused me to have a panic attack that resulted in me being almost nonverbal for about half an hour.\n\nAnother mild fixation is general sensory processing. My clothes need to feel symmetrical on both sides of my body. If something brushes against one hand, it needs to brush against the same place on the other hand. Any sort of sensory asymmetry upsets me greatly. If my hair won't sit right, or refuses to cooperate, I just snip it off. \n\nThese obsessions are obviously affecting my everyday life and my ability to be happy. I can never relax or feel satisfied because there's this ominous, looming inevitability of a disaster or a Bad Thing. For years, I've written these things off as universal experiences, that everyone does these things and feels this way. But I'm starting to kind of doubt that.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I have acid reflux that I've never taken any kind of medication or supplement for\n\nI've been losing hair since Fall - Early Winter of 2018, it started as thinning around the temples of my hair, it looked like a normal receding hairline that I didn't care too much about. My entire scalp was sore and it'd hurt to pull **any** hair on my scalp. My hair was falling out all over and I'd often wake up to a pillow covered in hair or a hairy bathtub after showering. An excess amount of hair would come out of my hair no matter where I combed from. All of my hair was shedding but all of my hair kept growing like normal except areas at the side/top of my head that just stopped growing entirely has since to grow with the rest of my hair. Over time though, my scalp stopped being sore and my hair stopped shedding.\n\n**my medical issue**\n\nI didn't think anything of it but now my scalp problems are hard to ignore. My scalp is in constant pain ! It feels like I'm constantly being bit by fire ants. It burns for hours and will leave a bald spot when I look at it a few hours later. I'll have a bald spot exactly where I felt burning as if the burning itself is what caused my hair to fall out. It only effected my hairline at first, leaving coin sized spots that would overlap and then eventually a big chunk of hair would be gone. Eventually I started to have areas on the \\[side, top - mostly\\], as well as the back that would burn and leave circular bald spots. When there's a new area, it'll present itself with a very intense itch, it's hard to ignore. After a few weeks, sometimes days, that spot'll start burning and leave no hair behind it. It's most only effected hair at the sides of my head and around the temple, they overlap and the burn is more severe in these areas. There's since been many other areas with burning circles which have yet to overlap.\n\nI spent hours trying to research why this was happening to me. My hair still falls out even when I don't scratch or itch it. Oils and Conditioners only seem to make it burn more. I'm not depressed and I'm not stressed. I can't massage my hair in these areas because it hurts, it hurts to pull or play with and is sensitive to touch usually; especially during episodes of hair loss . The spots that fall out and have no more hair remaining don't burn or itch after all hair is gone but when I put oils, conditioner, or growth serum on it, especially around my forehead - I can feel it begin to burn the spots where my hair once was.\n\nThis is progressively getting worse and worse, it happened every week or so at first until it started happening every other day. Now it happens every day. I didn't think it was natural because I've never heard of anyone with pattern baldness feeling pain or having bald spots all around their scalp. Not only is my hairline too uneven too be M shaped, but these burns have also started to effect the middle-top portion of my scalp/widow peak. I'm scared to go bald especially if there's anything I could do before it's too late. I'm not able to go to a doctor or get a physical examination. My mom refuses to take me and I'll never be taken seriously. you guys are my only hope\n\n**pictures**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/FHxSAoM](https://imgur.com/a/FHxSAoM)", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Fast-forward three years later, I'm looking at making a second try. I function very well in society and have not been on many medications since high school.

Going for full body check soon, hopefully someone can give me some insight", "author": "ikuzuse", "self_text": "Alright, I've been lurking reddit for a long time, but this is officially my first time posting.   \nI know it' pretty stupid to get diagnosed online but I'm quite desperate and would appreciate any insight.  \n\n\nLong story short. About 4y. ago I \\[24F\\] developed some unusual symptoms. Every now and then, when I feel as if I caught random flu, I'd also get + these only two unusual symptoms:1) intense blood rush(as if I was hanging upside -down) towards my head every time I bend it over slightly (even for opening desk drawer in my office) and 2nd weird one is that I keep feeling strange air bubbles running up and exploding inside my nose. This air in the nose is completely random and has almost nothing to do if I bend my head or not, but super weird and disgusting feeling. These symptoms like any flu lasts only 2-4 days and goes away. Then everything is normal. But after month or so it comes back (lately more often). One doctor kind of diagnosed me with Sinusitis. Performed x-ray, prescribed medication. No mucus came from my nose. I went to another doctor after 6 months who can manually check and see any sinusitis. Which he confirmed I don't have and said that x-ray is old fashioned method. He suggested vertigo. But I know quite few people who have vertigo, they get nausea, disorientation etc which I don't, unless this vertigo varies in different spectrum? Any ideas? There was suggestion from another family doctor that it has something to do with posture and spine, and there is nothing to worry about.. All of them seem like its not life threatening symptoms, but I cant help my self but worry a bit as it is indeed unpleasant feeling and I would like if not cure it at least start trying to improve and finally get to know exactly what it is. I'd like to start getting examination of full body. But its tricky and would be helpful if someone have any ideas what areas specifically I can test? MRI for brain? Any insight would be helpful. Also please note I'm really not the person who is freaking out for every little thing when it comes to the health, most of my life I've been pretty ignorant and chose to suffer rather to go and get help (which is wrong), but I perceive from all docs that they assume I'm just another crazy hypochondriac, when in reality it's the first time I'm trying to take care of my self! About the time to grow up. But this whole journey makes me feel helpless...  \n\n\nThank you!  \n\n\n P.s sorry english is not my first language", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I thought what I went through was normal until I got to high school and talked to people and no one else had these thoughts. I've never been sure of what I have or have had the means to get formally diagnosed. When you hear about people having ocd they normally talk about it being a fixation on a specific thing like germs or something. But that's not me. I get fixated on random things but they are recurring every now and again.\n\nFor example, I've always had this thing where when I sniffle I need to follow it by clearing my throat, then swallow, then blink a few times until I feel it is satisfactory (idk how to explain this it's just a feeling with all of the triggers is I do them until it just feels \"right\"). If any of those steps are messed up I do it until it's right which can take minutes. This one kind of goes away. Like I dont need to do it for a while but then after a few months it starts triggering me again. Right now for some reason I do it mainly when I'm eating.\n\nAnother example which is more recent and completely new, whenever I dring out of a straw I have to put it in between by front teeth in the back and kind of slide it down between them in a certain way every time I take a sip and if it's not \"right\" I do it again.\n\nThinking back on my life I've always dealt with it and tried to fight it. Like when I was youger I'd be on a computer and when I left it the mouse needed to be exactly in the middle of the mouse pad. I remember hating this and trying to ignore it but after so much time needing to go back and fix it because I couldn't leave it. If I got a drink and set the glass down wrong I'd need to refill it and drink again until I set it down right and this could happen to the point of almost throwing up. When I was in 5th or 6th grade I remember having problems breathing. We went and got me checked out and no one knew what was wrong with me. They gave me an inhaler anyway just in case. Thinking back on it I think it was ocd. The problem was sometimes I didn't feel like I was get enough air. To satisfy it I had to take a deep breath until it felt satisfactory than I'd be fine for a while until it happened again. I was getting plenty of air but my brain said I needed to get a certain amount and I couldn't stop taking deep breaths until I got it.\n\nAlso sometimes I have thoughts of scenarios that I have to think about over and over again until I think about them right. This is normally the worst because this can take upwards of 30 minutes to get over it. I've been sitting in classes and have missed entire lectures due to it and its impacted my schooling and life I  general.\n\nThere are other things but those are main points I wanted to type out quickly to see what people thought. I know this is no substitute for real professional help but I dont know if I'm ready for that and just kind of wanted an idea if I'm just overthinking everything or if I do have a problem and should seek help in the future", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Last friday, I woke up and felt like I had been hit by a truck. I ached head to toe, had a temperature of 102, very mild stomach pain and nausea, full body chills to the point I was shivering and shaking, and an absolutely pounding headache. Went to work for 4 hours, couldn't do it anymore and went to the doctor. \n\n\n\nAt the doctor I was told I had a type of flu. I was given the flu test and it came back negative, however the doctor was sure that I had some type of flu. I was given a cough syrup with codeine to help the pain from the aches. Saturday I felt like I had done a 180. Throat was a bit sore, very tired, temp was in mid 99s, but other than that I felt fine.\n \n\n\nSunday was better yet, fever had broke, the only thing was i had a few mild bouts of dizziness every once in a while. Started eating again and went to work on monday. Worked a full 10 hour day in construction, came home, ate dinner, felt fine. No fever. About an hour after dinner I started to get a headache again, and my stomach felt funny. I laid on the couch for a while and went to bed. \n\n\n\nFlash forward to 2 am this morning. Woke up, stomach is turning circles. Extremely dizzy, can't walk more than a few feet without having to stop because I'm about to throw up or fall over. Sit in front of the toilet, and do some pretty violent dry heaving, but nothing would come out. Extreme dizziness continued, slept on the bathroom floor. \n\n\nSlept till about 10 this morning. I still have some dizziness and nausea, and my stomach is painful and cramped up. It feels like I'm going to have diarrhea some point as well. I keep getting an acid type heartburn feeling at the bottom of my throat, and I keep burping. My fever is back as well, my temp is reading as 100. \n\n\nAnybody know what this could be?

I became extremely congested and had cold-like symptoms, I then proceeded with a cold crash course treatment and the cold/congestion I had was gone within a couple days. However, a few things remained. A pretty bad headache - it was a tension type headache that caused awful pain in the temporal muscle, as well as post nasal drip. Since then, these two things have been consistent, 24/7. I still have the constant PND mucus and 24/7 headache that now gets triggered into migraines. With this, I also sleep on average 15+ hours a day. I just awoke from a 30 hour straight sleep and feel awful. The only time that I can actually be awake during the day is if I wake up at 8 pm on an evening, stay up through the night and stay up through the day - I of course can't do this sustainably and decide not to as it could make issues worse. I have seen a General Practitioner, he is clueless and was referred to a numerologist around Jan of 2019. Was prescribed pretty much everything under the radar, including, Effexor, beta blockers, lamictal, gabapentin, muscle relaxers, calcium channel blockers, DHE 45 in injection and suppositories, steroids, every kind of OTC pain medication, nasal sprays, I've also had two rounds of botox, without much success. At this point, I can handle the headaches, but I can't handle this sleep problem! It started occurring around the same time in November, when this all happened and I'm constantly fatigued during the day. I already take stimulants, which we have ruled out to be an issue - but this has no impact on my sleep or daytime fatigue. I eat healthy, as well as exercising as much as physically possible.

I had an ultrasound of my stomach back in 2017 which was normal. Echocardiogram that was normal. I had tilt table testing done to test for POTS and the first 10 minutes were normal but I had severe symptoms when given the nitroglycerin. Ultimately, that test was also ruled normal.

Never smoked, no street drugs.\n\nThe deal: I feel this pressure in my chest like my lungs can't expand fully to take a deep, comfortable breath. It feels like something catches right at the end of the inhalation, stopping my chest or lungs from expanding to their max capacity. Once in awhile, I am able to get a full breath and I can feel a physical \"release\" of something expanding fully in my lungs. (The best comparison I can use to describe the sensation is like a spastic muscle releasing and getting a full stretch, except it's happening inside my chest.) I'm often able to achieve a full breath when I change positions, particularly if I stand up and bend forwards a little at the waist. It's also easier to get a full breath when I yawn but isn't successful every time. Breathing feels marginally less comfortable lying on my back and marginally more comfortable lying on my stomach (I know. Weird.)

Not just lethargic or low energy. I would drop a sleep. As well as this i got no energy from food at all, if anything i had more energy the less i ate. My parents put this down to being a teenager. This is when my attention and focus seemed to disappear.\n\nFocusing on anything for any length of time caused me great discomfort, at times became painful, causing head aches, sometimes even putting me to sleep. This got worse as I got older\n\nIn my late teens I used to have frequent spells where my heart would start racing for no reason, usually at night. It was as if I had be pumped full of adrenaline, like something out a movie, really beating so hard and fast I thought it would burst. One night I got up and asked my parents to feel my chest, they thought I was having a heart attack. They convinced me to see a doctor, they referred me to a heart specialist. At the time I was sleeping all the time. The doctor said there was nothing wrong. \n\nAs I went into my 20s still constantly tired all the time, I started to get depressed. This happened almost like clock work, after so many months I\u2019d have a point where I had to take a week off from work, relationships, everything and just sleep. \nI felt like my brain had run out of something and sleeping helped.\n\nOver my 20s my diet was a lot of sugar and caffeine to stay awake. Consuming large amounts of cola. This kept me awake and functioning, however left me falling dropping a sleep without any notice.During this time, i set fire to my flat a number of times falling a sleep while cooking, I was disciplined at work for sleeping in, as well as dropping out of college due to non attendance due to sleeping in. I also started developing sores on my scalp and my scalp started to become red and inflamed as well as losing hair, this never went away and still effects me today. \n\nIn my mid 20s I started taking modafinil, I also changed my diet to first no gluten then to high fat low carbs to see if this would help with my energy levels. It did. I got a promotion, a stable relationship. My focus and concentration however were still terrible and I would still be tired all the time, just not to the same extent. \nHowever whenever I had a high carb meal, I would revert back to sleeping all the time. Dropping a sleep after work.\n\nIn October last year I started getting a pain in my lower right side, it was painful but I thought it would go away.  I was no longer fully digesting my food properly, even easily digestible foods where making their away unchanged though my body, it was as if I wasn\u2019t making any stomach acid at all. \n\nIn January this year I decided to reach out privately to help fix my focus and concentration, previous GPs had all said there was nothing wrong with me for the last 17 years. I was diagnosed with ADHD with attention and focus being the main issue. I came off modafinil and went on long acting stimulant lisdexamfetamine, which put me to sleep after after a few hours. After 6 weeks I changed to Ritalin. This also put me to sleep quicker. Both very similar to when I would fall a sleep through a high carb meal. It was like taking sleeping pill.\n\nDuring this time I had private tests done to see if I could find the root cause of the pain in my right side. This showed higher than normal prolactin levels. My doctor dealing with the ADHD told me he had never heard of anyone having High prolactin levels with out taking anti psychotics, which i was not,  I asked if this could have effected the way the medication was working and contributing to my falling a sleep? I was told no. He told me he did not feel comfortable treating me further as he wanted me to have the prolactin issue looked at.\n\nI went back on modafinil however now it does nothing what so ever. So after a few weeks I stopped taking it again. \n\nMy GP at the time did a test for food poisoning, which I tested positive for. She said I most likely had it for weeks, I was put on antibiotics. I think this is due to the lack of stomach acid. \n\nI saw an endocrinologist who said that the prolactin was twice that of a normal man. But not enough to indicate a tumour, from January to May I have had 4 prolactin tests all the same result. He said that it most likely is depression. Which I feel is something doctors say when they don\u2019t know what the cause is. \n\nMy DHEAs has been over the normal range into the high range for years also. \n\nI\u2019ve had my B12, active b12, cortisol, oestrogen, testosterone, tested all normal. Which my endo told me was strange as prolactin which is high normally increases oestrogen and lowers testosterone however this is the case. But nothing to worry about. \n\nRecently I have tried selegiline and Phenethylamine. It was out of this world. To high a dose of Phenethylamine and I lose the use of my legs. I have to let down for at least an hour. However when this passes, I feel like how I imagine Ritalin should feel. Focused. Alert. Full of energy. \nWhy does this work and Ritalin doesn\u2019t? \n\nI\u2019m now 30, I\u2019ve had years of sleeping and years of no focus. I\u2019ve never read a book and I have dropped out of education multiple times. I am worried about my health as I get older. But also I want to use my life to do something, and without focus and energy it seems like pushing water up a hill.  \n\nI am looking for help to get to the bottom of what could be broken that is effecting my attention and energy. Also if this is connected to my digestive and hormonal problems. \n\nAny help would be amazing. \n\nThank you", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I can see, hear, smell, taste, touch, feel pain and think to a certain degree, but that's all there is. I don't feel happiness, sadness or \"moods\" (I can remember how things like christmas and rainy weather made me \"feel\" a certain way). It's completely empty in my head except for rare occasions where I just randomly decide to think in language, or when I read/write. \n\nNow the weird thing that makes me think it's not just depression or anything like that is how I'm acting just like someone with emotions. I can laugh with my friends and cry watching a sad movie, but my head will be completely empty no matter what I'm doing. When good things happen to me I will act more cheerful, even alone, despite not actually consciously experiencing anything different. It's as if all the feelings and decision making is happening somewhere else in my brain, outside of my consciousness. \n\nSo basically my body will feel happy and sad, but my conscious experience remains the same, absolutely nothing. This is a big problem for my life, because it seems to give me these extreme motivation issues. When I exercise, go to work and socialize with friends my subconscious might be happy, but it doesn't really matter to me because I'm not receiving any of the benefits. No matter what I do I just feel the same, and any action that that isn't sleeping or chasing some empty dopamine hit requires an enormous amount of effort that just isn't possible for me to put in very frequently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome additonal information: \n\nI have severe memory problems, I can't recall anything on my own without something that reminds me of the memory. I can hold somewhat normal conversations, but I can't remember the specifics of anything that's being said, just the general topic. I find myself forgetting words a lot.\n\nI can't really delay gratification anymore. Although I'm at a healthy weight right now, it's only because it's tedious to go buy food. If I had easy access to food without needing to go out and buy it myself, I'd probably be obese. Food is the only real desire I have in life right now, although I'd definitely be doing drugs as well if I ever tried them out.\n\nOne year ago I had a really good dream where I actually felt feelings for the first time in 4 years, it had a big impact on me and made me stop going to work and eventually quit (haven't had a job since). I remember everything seeming extremely unbearable and pointless in the weeks after I had the dream, I spent a lot of time just laying in bed crying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, working a job or following a routine like this is absolutely impossible. I can't even show up at my psychologist most of the time, so I am stuck in a cycle where no progress is being done. If I could find a lead on my condition it would be really amazing.

I'm sorry in advance if this is scattered and all over the place. I'm really worried about her because I've never seen her this sick or mentally gone. She's always been a rock for my family, but now she's so weak and can't handle day to day life. \n\nShe doesn't eat much at all because of nausea, she gets terrible headaches, panic attacks where she paces for HOURS at a time, stares blankly into space a lot, and she's weak and cannot leave the house or drive. It's been bad like this for a few weeks now.\n\nDoctors have done blood tests after blood tests, but everything came back normal. Her endocrinologist has her taking more than her usual dose of thyroid medication because she has Hashimotos Hypothyroidism and has struggled with it for years. Her TSH (I think that's what it's called) is at 10.4, which is WAY higher than it should be. She even went to the ER, but they sent her on her way after giving her fluids and nausea medication. \n\nThis all started month ago when she went back on an antidepressant that she had been off of for about 7 months.\n\nMy dad has spent two weeks home with her to take care of her, but he can't miss much more work. She has an appointment with a psychiatrist on Monday, but I'm not sure how that will help.\n\nIf anyone has ANY ideas, insights, or inklings, please share. We don't know what to do and I feel as though doctors aren't doing much to help her. I will try my best to answer any questions. \n\n(sorry if this isn't the sub for this.

This last 4 weeks has been really scary, and I\u2019m still trying to figure out what\u2019s going on in my body. Any help would be appreciated.\n\n**Me**\n\nI\u2019m 35/m, W. European descent. Mom has MS, aunt had ALS. (only known family member with ALS). I work a desk job, lift weights regularly, eat healthy. Moderate anxiety.\n\n**Ulnar Symptoms**\n\nBeen having bilateral ulnar numbness in the pinky and ring fingers 8 weeks. 4 weeks ago I went to see my GP, he suspected nerve entrapment, but said it was a little unusual to have on both sides. This made me worry a bit.\n\nThe next day I woke up with brain fog, slight dizziness, and feeling slightly shaky and all limbs. Very slightly uncoordinated.\n\n**Twitching/Cramps Started**\n\nThe morning after that my calves started twitching. And after looking online, I basically had an ALS panic that I\u2019m still recovering from.\n\nA friend gave me low-dose Klonopin to manage the anxiety, which I\u2019ve been taking since then. Over the next 24 hours the twitches spread to my upper legs and abdomen, now it\u2019s in my arms as well.\n\nI got cramps in both hands and feet, and I visited Neurologist 1. He suspected BFS ([Benign Fasciculation Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_fasciculation_syndrome)) and told me to manage my anxiety and return in a week. Got an RX for Zoloft.\n\nI came back to Neuro 1 with worse twitching (more frequency, locations) and I was feeling a shakier and weaker in my movements. (e.g. Shaky when going down stairs, and my hands shake a lot when flexing my bicep.)\n\n**EMG, MRI, EEG, Bloodwork came back normal**\n\nPhysical neurological exam was normal. He ordered a brain MRI and a bunch of bloodwork, including electrolytes, B12, Creatine Kinase, Thyroid, and a ton more. Both the MRI and bloodwork came back normal.\n\nI was referred to another Neuro (2). Exam was normal, including a quick look at my mouth/tongue. He ordered an EEG, Nerve Conduction Study on 4 limbs, EMG on my arms, lumbar, and cervical area. All of these were clean. (Huge relief!)\n\n**Today:**\n\n\\- Widespread twitching below the neck.\n\n\\- All limbs are shaky and get tired really quickly. Right slightly more than left. More noticeable in the arms and hands.*I'm 99% sure that anxiety is not causing the weakness.  It might not be clinical, but it is something physical.  My anxiety has gotten a lot better, while the symptom has gotten worse.*\n\n\\- Hand/Foot cramps come and go, but are more mild now.\n\n\\- I get out of breath quickly.\n\n\\- Heart rate is noticeably higher and heavier than normal.\n\n**Still afraid of (bulbar?) ALS:**\n\n\\- My neck and tongue muscles have started getting tired really easily. I have lost vocal range when singing songs I\u2019ve sung before. When I try to sing a little, my tongue gets uncomfortably tired. It also tends to get tired at the end of the day.  \n\\- I\u2019m aware that stress can cause [Muscle Tension Dysphonia](http://www.otolaryngology.pitt.edu/centers-excellence/voice-center/conditions-we-treat/muscle-tension-dysphonia), and hope this is the cause.\n\n\\- I\u2019m not slurring and do not have trouble swallowing. No tongue twitches that I\u2019ve noticed.\n\n\\- I read that the EMG can\u2019t detect Upper Motor Neuron issues, which bulbar is.  \n\n\nI\u2019ll be seeing Neuro 2 again in 1.5 weeks, and am inclined to ask about spinal issues, stenosis, myelopathy, etc. Maybe an MRI of the cervical spine?  Been trying to think of everything- I had a tick bite 10 years ago. Dormant Lyme? No idea.\n\nI could really use your feedback. Thank you so much.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Sometimes when I would eat food I would get extreme  cramping pain in my stomach/abdomen, and that would be followed by  diarrhea. It would continue until there is nothing left in my digestive  track. This has been going on and off for years. In highschool it  happened for days on end minimum once a month. I have been to the  hospital for it and I have had multiple tests done. I have had a:  colonoscopy, endoscopy, a test where I had to drink this type of liquid  and they watched it pass through my system on an xray or something like  that, I've had blood and stool tests for salmonella, worms, bugs,  bacteria imbalances, and celiacs, yet everything came back normal. I  have also been treated for Giardia.\n\nI  have tried probiotics, antibiotics, over the counter stomach helpers  like Tums or Pepcid AC and none of it did anything. I have gone on  gluten free diets for multiple weeks and it has had no effects, still  problems. I have been taking dicyclomine and loperamide daily for over a  year now to try to deal with the symptoms and it usually works.\n\nHowever,  this past month has been particularly horrible. Cramping pain in my  abdomen that rates a 9 out of 10 on the pain scale. Explosive, violent  diarrhea follows the pain. I have been eating nothing but plain white  rice, as that is the only thing that does not cause me pain. In the last  2 months I have lost 10 pounds. I currently weigh around 125 pounds,  when at the start of summer I was 137. A year ago I was around 140 to  145 pounds.\n\nFor  the last 3 weeks I have been eating nothing more than 200 calories a  day in plain white rice and plain bread. I can see myself turning into a  skeleton. I don't have any energy and I am slowly starving to death. I  am actively going to doctors however they do not see anything wrong with  me. I just had a second endoscopy and colonoscopy done this past week  and everything looked good. I am actively having diarrhea and extreme  abdominal cramping pain every single day. I only drink water. The pain  is so bad that I am too afraid to eat anything.\n\nI  am legitimately terrified for my life right now. I had to quit my job  because I cannot do anything other than sit around and wait for  pain/diarrhea.\n\nPlease I will answer any questions you people have, I am honestly begging for someone to help me.

I had my neck craned down reading cards in my hand while she finished her turn, and started to smell iron. \n\nI said \u201cwhoa, i kinda smell iron, is this what a nosebleed is like? I might be having a nosebleed\u201d (never had one) and suddenly I felt a rush as my nose decompressed, and a wave went up my sinuses and over the top of my head. I also had a tight chest, felt nauseous, and my legs felt sort of numb (felt like being high on an edible). Afterward, I was spacey and couldn\u2019t think very straight, and felt a feeling of \u201cbrain activity.\u201d It felt like my brain was working hard but I wasn\u2019t doing it. It was a frustrating feeling. I also felt some pain on the right side of my head. \n\nI was really freaked out so we went to the ER just to make sure it wasn\u2019t like some aneurysm and I had a CT scan and an EKG,  both of which showed nothing out of the ordinary. I wanted an EEG as soon as I got there to see if it was some kind of seizure but it was multiple hours of waiting so that was a bust. Bloodwork came back normal as well.\n\nSince then I\u2019ve had some similar episodes of feeling, no two exactly the same but usually milder than described above. Maybe a few times a month. I\u2019ve had an MRI of my brain with and without contrast that looked good, and an APRN said she\u2019d be interested in an MRI of my cervical spine (C1, C2 area I think?) but I don\u2019t want to shell out for it yet since it doesn\u2019t seem life threatening.\n\nMy most notable symptoms/attacks since March are:\n\nLooking down at my phone during a night class and feeling tooth sensitivity and a lightning bolt of pain down the right side of my face that scared the hell out of me.\n\nAnd couple of days ago I was in bed watching YouTube at night and had minor symptoms. I ignored them since it\u2019s never been harmful before and I was trying not to add a panic response to my symptoms to have a more accurate judgement of what I\u2019ve been experiencing. 10 minutes after that, I felt sinus build up that released into a wave over my brain as my eyes felt sort of crossed. I had a retainer in so I couldn\u2019t tell if I was actually slurred but my brain felt like it was tough as I said \u201choney honey honey\u201d to wake up my girlfriend.

I have tried to sum everything up as best I can, as well as keeping it easy to read. \nTo start: I'm a 25 year old female. I am 5'3.5\" and currently weigh 155, although my weight shifts quickly. I have many diagnoses, but we also do not know for sure what is going on. My current diagnosis is Hemiegic migraines and a general joint hypermobility. I have Meniere's disease and gastroparesis as well. I am deaf in my left ear and have vision problems and glasses. I also have sub-centimeter nodes in thyroid. I have been considered for MS, Ehlers-danlos, lyme, and a mess of other disorders. \n\nI feel as though everything I face is interconnected, but I don't know how so I will put my known history. My symptoms and odd findings:\nCould not eat as an infant. Continued abdominal pain and full body dislocations and sublexes. This has lead to many injuries from sprains to tears. Doughy, slightly stretchy skin randomly bleeds underneath, causing small dot-like bruising. Doesn't heal well and easily tears.First surgery at 11 revealed twisted bowel and filopian tube, however completely covered in adhesions with no know cause. Gallbladder removed at 17, covered in scar tissue. Colonoscopy at 19 revealed bowel twisted in scar tissue. \nGastric problems persistent. Have gastroparesis and stomach inflamation. Constant abdominal pain. Recently had esophagus dialated and diagnosed with a circopharyngeal disorder(cannot remember name will edit upon finding paperwork). Many foods trigger allergenic symptoms and sensitivities, such as tree nuts, gluten amd lactose that have developed over time. Migraines entire life. First experience with numbess at 13-15. Continued off and on. \nExperienced multiple miscarriages. First live child at 20, complications included bleeding, early contractions requiring bed rest. Born via emergency c-section after 18hour labor, caught in hip. At 23 had second live child after another miscarriage, born via planned c-section. Similar complications as first child. \nDirectly after c-section: Personal health deteriorated. Experinced full paralysis on right side leg and hand. At the same time experienced shooting electrical like pains down spine, from base of skull tail-bone. Migraines worsened. Brain Fog and swollowing problems. Seizures and memory problems. Extreme musculoskeletal pain. Speech problems. Was given multiple medications from gabapenten to topamax. Topamax 200mg twice a day eventually aided in symptoms lessening. Took over a year to to be able to walk and still experience numbness occasionally. First diagnosis was MS or b12 deficiency, tests came back negative. Was diagnosed Hemiplegic Migraines, but also told they were unsure what it was. Most symptoms still persist and seem similar to experinces throughout childhood and teen years, only increased in severity. Mentally I have been diagnosed with PTSD, Major and Post-partum depression, general anxiety. Possible Aspergers. Doctors do not believe mental condition causes physical condition due to preexisting before mental condition started. Believed mental conditions may be caused or worsened by physical condition, though stress makes all worse. Physical condition and pain has driven me to suicidal ideations as it is hard to live at times and is leaving my family life stressed.\nPlease, if anyone has any answers or theories please give me your thoughts.

I'm also vitamin d deficient. Other than that, my family and I do not have any history of debilitating diseases, mental or physical. \n\nI've recently experienced life altering occurrences. I do not know if this is related, but back in October I had flu like symptoms that lasted for about 2 weeks. I had fevers and chills, as well as muscle spasms and joint pain. Six weeks prior to this I had unprotected sex. Later, I thought these instances were somehow related. Fast forward to February, I start experiencing a series of strange symptoms. First it started with a really intense chill that ran through my legs and to my butt. The chill was so intense that it was painful.  To the touch, my skin felt fine, but inside was freezing. Then there was an instance where a wave went over me and I felt like I was going to fall over. At another point, my hearing was shot, but it came back within moments. Soon after I started experiencing an intense tingling in my brain and stomach. After a few days, this went away as well, but I've noticed lasting damage. After this happened my face started to twitch uncontrollably for a few days, my lip as well as the area above my eyebrow. This too went away, but the issues that remain have to do with my brain itself. I no longer have the same cognitive ability. I was in school with a full academic scholarship, but this has caused me to request for a break of sorts, as I can no longer function in class. I couldn't do simple math, and I can no longer think of simple things to say. My conversation skills have deteriorated, like the next idea of what to say never comes. I used to have a sense of humor too, but that is completely gone now. Also, I used to be extremely ticklish, but now I feel nothing to that sort of touch. It's like there is a disconnect between my nerves and my brain. I've also noticed I never feel hungry anymore. I never get hunger pains, my stomach never growls. Anyway, I thought this could somehow be related to me having unprotected sex. I was struggling to find answers through this and read that HIV can cause CNS/brain issues. But I've been tested for everything, including HIV, countless times and always came out negative. I also did an MRI on my brain and everything appeared normal. All of the structures of my brain are normal, and nothing has ruptured. I don't know if this is a post viral syndrome type issue or a neurological problem. \n\nI've also been tested for autoimmune diseases, like lupus for example, but nothing came up. \n\nIt has been brought to my attention that it could be Lyme disease, which I'll request to get tested for. I don't live in an area where tics are common though, and I've never seen a tick on my body or been bitten by one to my knowledge. And I have never gotten the bulls eye rash that is typical of an infection. \n\nSomeone else mentioned MS. I'll admit that I know little of the disease, and a doctor has never questioned me about it. \n\nI'm posting here because no doctor can seem to figure out what the issue is. My problems were discounted so often, doctors claiming it could be an anxiety or mental issue, that I went to a psychiatrist and a psychologist to see if such notions were valid. Both the psychiatrist and psychologist claimed that I did not have a mental or emotional issue- that it must be something else. \n\nI really need help. This has essentially ruined my life.

I am getting kind of desperate for answers on this.\n\nI am 34 year old male, about 185 pounds for context. I don\u2019t smoke, but do drink alcohol which I should probably cut back on (about 4 times a week). Back in January of this year I had my parents drive me to the ER because it felt like my heart was beating through my chest. As I was walking my dog I felt a tingle go down the left side of my body and I went in to panic mode, I could then feel my heart absolutely racing and I could not do anything to slow it down. Fast forward to the ER I checked in with a heart rate over 150, but thankfully I was not having heart attack like I thought I was. They did a chest X-ray and whatever other typical tests they do for an ER visit and found nothing except a slightly decreased potassium level. Earlier in the day I did have a large cup of coffee, and an energy drink a couple hours after, and a couple of beers. I know that was stupid. So they sent me home and said this was due to all of the caffeine I had that day along with the decreased potassium level.\n\nI decided to quit drinking alcohol and coffee cold turkey at the time, but I just did not feel right for months after while I did this. I would feel occasionally light headed, foggy, got some shortness of breath, would get recurring burping spells, got what I thought were heart palpitations (halter monitor I later wore didn\u2019t show any), my hands would feel colder than usual on occasion, and I was just kind of always afraid I was going to drop dead of a heart attack. I kept googling and looking for answers while I waited to see a cardiologist and came across a post of someone who said they had similar symptoms from caffeine withdrawal (I have always been a pretty big caffeine drinker, about 3 cups of coffee a day). So I decided to ease my way back in to caffeine and pretty much all of the symptoms went away when I did\u2026 except the burping.\n\nSo I went to a cardiologist and got an echo-cardiogram, I wore a halter monitor for 48 hours, and got a stress test on a treadmill. All the results came back perfectly normal. My cardiologist called to ensure me that I have a very strong heart (she knew I was kind of a wreck at this point so it was nice she used those words to describe the results to comfort me). My blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not to the point of medication but because of that I always get anxious about heart things. I also have a touch of white coat syndrome in that I absolutely hate getting my blood pressure taken by someone, I can\u2019t really explain that. Anyway I kind of chalked the burping up to anxiety thanks to google, and the previous symptoms up to caffeine withdrawal and went on about my life. But one thing that hasn\u2019t gone away is the burping. It comes and goes, some days I will feel mostly normal, then all of a sudden I will have a full on burp attack. Like it is not just a couple of burps, I am burping hardcore for 15 minutes straight sometimes. And I feel like I have to burp every other breath. I have to do the thing where I force myself to burp because it feels like I absolutely have to let that air out of my chest. I can\u2019t take a deep breath until after I let out one of these long burps. Letting the air out with a big burp feels temporarily so good, but it builds back up in the next couple of breaths and out come more burps. Eventually they do subside, but while it is happening I put myself in to almost a full blown panic attack. I once read somewhere burping can be a sign that you are having a heart attack so I just always assume this is something with my heart when it starts. But since my cardiologist said I was fine, I then decided to go to a gastro. I now kind of thought that I either had GERD or perhaps worst case stomach cancer. They performed an upper endoscopy and found nothing except \u201cslight acid reflux\u201d. She said very minimal. So there is no way that explains the intensity of the burping I am getting. \n\nDoes anyone have any idea what this is a symptom of? I google excessive burping and heart, and angina pectoris comes up. Could I have that? Would the echocardio/chest xray/stress test/halter monitor have caught that? If not, how do I test for that? Is it just anxiety? Could it be a stomach issue the endoscopy did not catch? I am not expecting answers to all of these questions, that\u2019s just kind of my stream of consciousness always present worries. But since this all started in the immediate aftermath of my ER visit for a spiked heart rate I am just assuming this has something to do with that, but I guess it\u2019s a possibility this is independent of that. It just doesn\u2019t seem likely to me. I don\u2019t even know who to ask anymore, none of my doctors seem concerned (my primary, gastro, or my cardiologist) which I guess is a little comforting, but I am extremely concerned. It just does not feel normal. It\u2019s driving me crazy and when it happens it is honestly very scary. If anyone could give me any insight on maybe tests to ask for, or if you have come across anything like this before I would be hugely appreciative of any information I can get. Sorry for the wall of text!\n\nTLDR: I have been getting hardcore excessive burping attacks since January when I was admitted to the ER for a spiked heart rate that was kicked off by excessive caffeine consumption coupled with alcohol. Cardiologist said I\u2019m fine, Gastro said I\u2019m fine, Primary said I\u2019m fine, but I never had these attacks before that issue and they are now driving me insane. Could I have a heart issue my cardio did not catch? Angina pectoris? What else could this be? Are there any tests I should ask for outside of what I have already had (Chest x-ray, echo cardiogram, treadmill stress test, 48 hour halter monitor, upper endoscopy). I am really desperate for answers so any and all input is really appreciated. Thank you!!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I am currently seeing a doctor for this issue, but I have to admit that it's confusing me, and my doctor doesn't have a clear diagnosis yet either.  \n\n\nI'm 34 and 190 lbs. I'm 8 months postpartum (C-section) but my weight is not from my pregnancy; I lost that pretty quickly. I wrote a post back in May about my frustrations with weight loss here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/bp2eem/frustrated\\_with\\_weight\\_loss\\_and\\_it\\_aint\\_my\\_first/](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/bp2eem/frustrated_with_weight_loss_and_it_aint_my_first/)   \n\n\nAbout two months after writing that and having little to no success losing weight on my own, I went to a weight loss clinic. I'd rejected the idea of taking weight loss pills in the past, but I was desperate. (If this post doesn't make it clear, I regret the decision and won't be taking them again.) I got a month's prescription of phentermine and Topamax.  \n\n\nThe pills worked like gangbusters. I only took them for 10 days (and only a half-dose for the first few days) and lost 10 pounds. However, about a week into taking them, I noticed some irregular heartbeats while working out. On the 10th day, I went for a walk with my dog and baby, and when I got back, I noticed I was getting irregular heartbeats every few minutes and some shortness of breath. I called the nurse at the clinic, and she told me to stop taking it. I called a Teladoc doctor who agreed and advised me to check if the symptoms persisted beyond a week or two.  \n\n\nNow, it's been almost four weeks since i stopped taking it, and while the symptoms have improved, they're not gone. This is what I'm experiencing:  \n\\- Irregular heartbeat (PVC as noted on an EKG), particularly when my heart rate gets up to 120 or so and in the minutes/hours afterwards  \n\\- Shortness of breath (not gasping or dizziness, but just feeling like I'm not getting quite enough air) and occasional involuntary inhales, like I'm yawning without being tired  \n\\- A frequent sense of vascular tension; like I can feel my veins? Mostly in my upper body, but in other parts of my body too.   \n\\- Irregular period - this might not be related, but postpartum, my periods had been very far apart (6-7 weeks) and starting in July when I was taking the phentermine, I had three in a six-week period, which is odd for me.  \n\\- A strange, metallic taste in my mouth, which started when I was on the pill  \n\n\nSome other information that might be helpful:  \n\\- I don't have any pre-existing heart issue that I know of.   \n\\- My only other medication is Norlyda (birth control)  \n\\- I have low-level anxiety, but I feel like a lot of people are dismissing my symptoms as just being a month-long panic attack, and it's very frustrating. I'm not saying that worrying about it is helping, but these symptoms often happen when I'm relaxed or thinking about something else  \n\\- My resting heart rate has stayed relatively normal (in the 70s) and my weight has been more or less the same  \n\\- On the couple of occasions over the past month that I've had more than a drink or two, my symptoms were much more noticeable the next day  \n\\- I went to the doctor on Thursday: my chest X-ray was normal, my blood oxygen was normal, and my thyroid hormone was in the normal range. However, I was pretty easily able to get a PVC to appear on my EKG by jogging in place for a couple of minutes before taking the test.  \n\n\nI'm going in tomorrow to pick up a 48-hour heart monitor to get more information about the exact nature of my heart issue. If the problems seem severe enough, they might do an echocardiogram to see if there is any damage to the structures of the heart.   \n\n\nI just don't get it. How am I still having these symptoms so long after stopping the phentermine, and after taking it for such a short time? I'm so confused, and worried that I've done permanent damage to my body. :( Any ideas would be appreciated.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

At this point my ears were very stuffy and sinuses were full. I flew back to MD the next Monday and on the descent into MD my left ear would not pop and I was in severe pain. Went to the ENT and they had to cut the eardrum and suck out fluid. Put me on a 5 day supply of prednisone. Continued ear pressure in both ears, continued pain in all sinuses,  now daily headaches. Went to CT for a week family vacation feeling lousy. My right ear started hurting so bad and feeling so full I went to an urgent care. They prescribed augmentin thinking the right ear was infected. I get back to MD from vacation and see the ENT immediately. He puts tubes in both ears and orders a CT scan, he also prescribed another  antibiotic and a stronger course of steroids. Last Friday, 2 days ago, I went in to see the ENT and he said the CT scan looks fine and has no idea why I feel so terrible. My right ear feels constantly full with pressure. Over the course of the day my sinuses start to hurt and I get a headache across my forehead. The ENT says as a last ditch effort he will perform a balloon sinuplasty on my sinuses and a tuboplasty on my estuchian tubes.

The pain, however, is still here, it's half past 11 on Monday here already, so it's becoming alarming. I suspected appendicitis, but these two are all the symptoms I have - other than that I have no other problematic symptoms like problems with defecation (diarrhea/constipation, though yesterday my poop was brown and slightly greenish at the end; this morning it was brown once again)/painful urination/fever/loss of apetite/vomiting (I vomit very rarely - haven't vomited since I was like 10 years old).\n\nYesterday afternoon I travelled over 150 km by bus, I carried a heavy backpack and the pain wasn't that bad but it became worse by the evening and it was especially painful when I lied down to sleep - I couldn't fall asleep so I talked to my roomates who were also awake and in the end I went back to try to sleep and some minutes after 3 am I fell asleep on my left side since the pain is on the right. The pain right now is like 6/10. My traumatized tooth was a lot more painful (the pain there left me out of breath at some point) than the pain I am going through now, but  it's still constant pain, so it's alarming, more or less. I'm eating yogurt and bananas right now. I ate a \"organic probiotic\" waffle in the morning as I was curious to try it anyway. I'm working from home at the moment.\n\nWhat could it be? Appendicitis? Some kind of hernia (because of the workout I went back to after not having trained for 3 months)? Just gas? Digestive problems? Colon infection? IBS? I have no idea. Some people told me that appandecitis should be located lower than that and be more painful, but I'm not sure. My personal GP is not in the same town so all I could was call him and he advised me to take medication (Buscolysin - no idea whether that's an international name but essentially it's hyoscine butylbromide) for 1 - 2 days max. and look for emergency services if it's not getting any better.\n\nUpdate (on the next day, 20 August): I got it checked by emergency services as the pain wasn't getting any better. It wasn't appendicitis, according to the doctors. Today I feel a bit better, even though there is still pain there.

So, i havent had sex in a while... A couple months but yesterday i noticed a bump on my genitals  just at the base of my penis.  It didnt hurt unless i squeezed it and i hadnt noticed it before. It was just a solitary bump that looked like it was underneath the skin and not on it.  It also didnt look like a blister at the time. I decided go ahead and pop it.  I did, and a lot of blood came out. I decided to shave around the area to get a better view of it and more blood came out in different areas but still close to the main bump (i assume i cut myself)  the blood came out for a while like 5-10m after i popped it.  Then it only bled when i squeezed it. \n Today however, it stings whenever i rub it or it gets rubbed against. It also looks bloody and has a strange metalic surface, like its glisening.  Its still only one wound but it doesnt look good. I am wondering if i should schedule an appointment to get it looked at for possible std/herpes? Or if its just an ingrown hair or cyst.  There are some hairs in the cut.  I just want it gone cause its uncomfortable when it gets rubbed and doesnt look good lol.  What are your guys thoughts?  Pictures are attached.  The first 2 pictures are from yesterday before i popped it.  The next 5 are from after i popped it and the last 7 are from today a day after i popped it.  Thanks for the help.\n\nSummary: bump on penis base and i cant tell if its herpes or not and am wondering if i should go to the doctors.  I think it might have been an ingrown hair since i pulled hairs out but i just want other opinions.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/ZIvBOfA", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

An ambulance came, and the paramedics initially thought it was a heart attack, however they managed to bring him back to normal. He ended up staying a whole week in the hospital due to being exhausted from it. The doctors came to the conclusion that it was an atrial fibrillation due to his anxiety. He had many tests, which all came back normal including scans on his legs for any blood clots. They started him on tablets, Aspirin, and some others Im not sure of. Eventually after about a month he didnt feel exhausted, and just about back to normal, occasionally having episodes of exhaustion that came spasmodically every few days. However until Saturday(3 days ago), he had another episode like the very first one, however not as severe but still needing an ambulance and was discharged out of the hospital the day after. His tests were normal. He then had another one today, feeling tingling in his hands, an exhausted feeling and got another ambulance. Again it wasnt as severe, but still very worring. He is in the hospital right now, and apparently since Saturday his Phosphate levels are down quite a bit.

I\u2019d like to preface that anxiety, ratings disorders, and any other mental disorder is off the table. I have been seen by multiple psychologists to rule them out. I\u2019m a 22 year old woman (Hispanic, 5\u20199, 180lbs) and I\u2019ve been athletic my whole life. Every time I work out, I get hives on my arms and sometimes they spread all over my body. My heart rate goes through the roof despite multiple normal EKGs. They have ruled out many heart diseases and conditions but nothing has seemed to relieve this. I vomit or have extreme heartburn after I eat or drink anything, including just plain water. I\u2019m fatigued almost every day and I\u2019ve had a couple new symptoms where my muscles spasm very quickly all over, not visibly, but it feels like my body is vibrating. When that happens, I get extremely sore and achey for days after. Along with that, I have some other odd symptoms.\n\nMy whole childhood, I had stomach problems; mostly vomiting and constipation. The first \u201cepisode\u201d I had was when I was about 6. I had just gone on a hike with my family and I started feeling sick in a way I had never felt before, and I had to sit down because I felt like I was going to fall over. My vision started getting blurry and then I saw colors flashing around and everything went black. I couldn\u2019t move, I could hear some things faintly but my eyes were wide open. No one took me to the doctor that time and it was basically forgotten. \n\nFast forward, when I was in middle school. I was getting ready for a basketball tournament and I got in the shower, a few minutes later, the same weird feeling came back and the spots, the vision going black, and not being able to move happened. This time, I could hear things more clearly during all this but I didn\u2019t actually know what was being said. My parents took me in to the ER when I woke up and they determined it was \u201ca normal teenage girl problem.\u201d Thankfully my parents didn\u2019t believe that and I went to my pediatrician the next day. However, he said the same thing. He said that teenage girls can be sensitive to hot water. 1) I was very well hydrated as I was in the middle of a tournament and 2) I was taking a cold shower to wake up. So that was an unexplained episode. \n\nIn high school, I ran a cross country meet and started feeling funky the minute I started. I got a horrible time and sat down after the race because I was so tired and drained feeling, I had never felt so horrible in my life. I was sitting there and I started getting spacey. Apparently my friend\u2019s mom came up to me and tried to speak to me but I wasn\u2019t making sense and I told her I was sick, luckily she\u2019s a nurse and she thought I was having heat stroke (on a 65 degree day...) but she called an ambulance and laid me down, she was doing everything she could to snap me out of it. Then I started shaking. Not like a seizure, but I was shivering all over and it didn\u2019t stop for 15 minutes. I don\u2019t remember anything. Apparently I was speaking and awake but when I felt like I finally snapped out of it, there was a giant crowd and it was a huge deal and I couldn\u2019t even remember where I was. The medics cleared me there and didn\u2019t even recommend going to the hospital. Luckily, my friend\u2019s mom, the nurse, told my parents to take me because something was wrong. They took me to the ER and they blamed it on dehydration. I was in and out of the ER for a week because the following days I was vomiting, I was having similar episodes that would just happen after doing nothing or just walking to the bathroom. I was so sick for about a week and then I was back to being a normal healthy kid. \n\nWhen I turned 18, another similar thing happened to the first two episodes and I went to my pediatrician and he blamed it on being a girl again. That\u2019s when I decided to seek a better doctor. It had been three years and nothing had happened, then I went to Europe for a few weeks. I came home and I was so sick. I thought I was actually dying one day. I had a really high fever, my back hurt, I was sweating and vomiting. They determined I had a kidney infection, but then later determined it wasn\u2019t and they didn\u2019t know what was wrong. This is the time that everything got really bad. I was literally fainting on a frequent basis and the fatigue was getting so bad some days I couldn\u2019t move. I was vomiting randomly and my heart rate goes crazy when I\u2019m up and moving. My blood pressure is always low and I\u2019ve been through dozens of tests where they can\u2019t find anything. Every doctor says I appear to be a healthy young woman but they believe that there is something going on inside of me. I have been bouncing between doctors and specialists trying to figure it out. I\u2019ve been hospitalized, so many ER visits, doctors office visits almost weekly. \n\nI\u2019m 22 and trying to get back to my \u201cnormal\u201d life, or maybe a life I haven\u2019t experienced yet. It\u2019s gotten so bad I can\u2019t run anymore, I can\u2019t rock climb or hike much either. My hobbies have been stripped and I had to quit track my sophomore year of college because I had an episode at practice one too many times. \n\nIf anyone has any ideas, literally anything, please reach out to me.

During this time I spent most of my time in bed and in front of my computer, and did **absolutely nothing** for my physical health. I've had depression for 8 years and have never really been into working out, but before the past major depression period, I at least did something resembling exercise.  \nNow I have finally found my joy of living again, but I fear that joy is already crumbling down.\n\nI'm an artist and got accepted into my dream art school, but while drawing my pre-exam tests felt some strain in my right forearm. Now, this is very common among people who use the computer or draw a lot, so I wasn't too worried about that at first. I decided to just rest it and let it heal.  \nBut the pain kept increasing and I decided to see a doctor who told me to rest for two weeks and I also got a prescription for some medicine that should help with the infection she suspected was causing my problems.\n\nAfter these two weeks, the strain had gotten better but I still wasn't feeling my 100%, so I met up with a physiotherapist who gave me very helpful tips on how to prevent this injury in the future, and also gave me a green light to get back to my usual activities.  \nI went home full of excitement to draw again, but just after one evening of very chill drawing with stretching and work-out breaks every 30 minutes my forearm relapsed.\n\nAfter that I have picked up daily yoga, stopped drawing completely, stretch every 30-45 minutes when on the computer, and nothing helped.\n\nAfter 2 months passed I slowly felt myself going insane. That's the longest time ever in my life without drawing and I can actually feel it affecting my mental health. Every person has that one outlet and a thing they have a burning passion for, and art is mine.  \nA couple of weeks ago I took my last bit of savings and went to see a chiropractor who is one of the best in where I live in. She found multiple very tense deep muscles and helped to relax them, and after seeing her 4 times I was actually getting hopeful that my ordeal was finally over. She was very confident that we had found the root of the problem, and that now that school starts I should be able to use my hand almost normally already. She explained that my strain injury wasn't a common one (something I had already figured out since a normal strain injury should heal in about two weeks), and that all the strain and lack of movement during the past years was simply just too much for my body. But in her opinion, I should start seeing results very quickly and could say goodbye for the strain.\n\nBut during my first week of school I had to use the computer to edit videos for a couple of hours, and the pain and strain returned again. It's still very bad and I feel like I'm back at the beginning. I am beyond frustrated and terrified that my dreams of becoming a professional artist are destroyed.  \n\n\nSome more information about the pain and issue: when I rotate my right elbow and the right side of my upper back it doesn't move freely. It feels like two broken cogwheels trying to rotate. While rotating it also lets out a noise as if someone just stepped on a bag of uncooked pasta. My right-arm bicep muscles also feel very odd. I simply can't put it into words but in certain arm positions it feels like the muscle moves in a very unnatural way, a way in which I can't move my left bicep muscle at all. This also causes pain.  \nI have tried doctros, physiotherapist, chiropractor, painkillers, ointments, daily exercise, stretching, some very pricey all-natural ointment that didn't do shit, and I just don't know what to do anymore.  I don't even know in which direction to go for help.  \n\n\nI apologize if I come off as frustrated or irritated, I'm just very stressed about this issue and can feel the pain and strain in my forearm and shoulder while writing.  \nIf anyone has any tips or advice I'm more than happy to hear them all.

I noticed it after getting a scab on the right middle of the shaft. Now I think this scab is because of a little too much playing with myself. It was the middle of summer exam week, and I probably masturbated anywhere from 9-12 times over a couple day period (I know way too much). The scab healed fine I put a bandaid on and some neosporin and its all gone.\n\nDuring that week though I thought I saw some discoloration on the left side that I assumed was from the same thing. It almost looked like a small and light brown bruise. I compare the color on the left side of the shaft to the clearly Irish white base of the penis. I do not think it has changed much color in the past month or two since the scab. I think I notice a little redness underneath foreskin once in a while as well.  I have never had an issue with urination or ejaculation including the couple days with scab. I have never had any pain except for the scab itself. I may have a little bit more sensitivity but I could be wrong. It is not an STD as that would require sexual transmission for which I have not participated in. Am I just crazy who never noticed the color of his genitals and thinks it is more sensitive because I am paranoid?\n\nShould I take a week or two off masturbation to see if it goes away, or should I see a doctor? I have not really withheld form masturbation since the scab went away.\n\nThanks a bunch!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

But the overwhelming feeling of fatigue never went away. \nTo this day, I need a minimum of 12 hours of sleep to feel rested when I initially wake up - but even then I\u2019ll need a nap again to get me through the rest of the day. \n\nI\u2019ve had numerous blood tests performed. I\u2019m not anemic. My thyroid levels are normal. I saw an endocrinologist to get a full workup, and my HPA-axis is apparently functioning normally. I\u2019ve had 2 sleep studies - both inconclusive. I was told that the results weren\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d - I fell asleep in &lt;4 minutes every time I dozed off, but they couldn\u2019t make a diagnosis based on the data they collected. \n\nCurrently, I take a cocktail of behavioral meds for depression. I\u2019m on abilify, cymbalta, and wellbutrin (I can provide doses if needed). I\u2019m also on 20 mg of adderall (taken 3 times a day). I will often supplement this with caffeine pills (1-2+ per day). I can fall asleep easily, but when I started taking the abilify, I started waking up during the night. So I take trazodone to stay asleep. \n\nMy routine may seem excessive, but my fatigue is still barely manageable. I would love to have an answer - even if the diagnosis isn\u2019t something curable - just to know if I\u2019m addressing my condition appropriately. \n\nThank you in advance.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

The next thing we noticed was her lack of presence in a conversation. This has gotten significantly worse over a 2 year period. You can be talking to her and visually see on her face that she is thinking something completely different, she is already 2 or 3 thoughts ahead and NEEDS to get whatever she is thinking out of her head. Not a millisecond will pass before you complete your sentence and she is already talking to you about something completely different. After that, we noticed she would repeat herself all the time, tell stories multiple times within minutes of each other to the same person. She will also ask the same questions over and over again to the point whoever is speaking to her becomes irritable. Sometimes she gets angry or upset about little things and doesn\u2019t seem to apply logic in those situations. One example is her fear of the dogs biting or ruining the blinds, when they have NEVER done anything of the sort. She goes out of her way to put things in front of the windows, lift the blinds a quarter of the way up, and a few other things that just seems so strange for something that doesn\u2019t happen.

I noticed it when I first entered university (i.e. skipping classes to sleep or not even interested in doing anything). University doctor suspected typical depression, despite me not being suicidal. I felt the medication just made numb (I tried, Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Cymbalta and Cipralex) nothing helped. Cut to recently, and I feel even more run-down and tired than before, sometimes taking a shower takes too much energy and feels like a whole day task. I feel my metabolism slowed down a lot, and I definitely don't feel like its due to the age. I work out 4 out of the 5 days, meal prep (talked to a nutritionist and have a personal trainer for the gym) but I haven't been losing weight at all (it was my personal trainer who recommend that I go see a doctor). I sleep for 8 hours, uninterrupted and deep sleep but I don't wake up feeling refreshed. I have tried sleeping less, sleeping more nothing works. I also don't wake up during the night. \n\n\nLink to blood tests: https://imgur.com/a/E1XpojL\n\nI recently got a family doctor who ordered a standard blood test to see if maybe there was anything else that could be causing my low energy. Results came in (Pic 1), my WBC was flagged as high and my RBC was flagged as low and he told me that it could be an iron deficiency and recommend that I take iron supplements (this was in May). \n\n\nI took the iron supplements for three months and did another follow up blood work (Pic 2). Again, my WBC increased and my RBC decreased despite not having a cold or other infection. Doctor recommended that I do a more specific type of test and received the results (Pic 3). \n\n\nI was hoping that someone could interpret what the results could mean. I am concerned with my WBC  increasing despite not having an infection. Could this be anemia related or is there something else that's going on? Also, could this be hypothyroidism? Many of the symptoms apply to me (i.e. thinning hair, irregular periods which BC has helped with)\n\n\nPlease note: I am waiting for my doctor to review the results and follow up with me.\n\nETA: The time frame between the tests is 3 months from the first to the second, and one week from the second to the third.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

But it truly feels as if there is more to me than just stress, depression and anxiety. I know I'm not a doctor and that Google is wrong the majority of time, so I have to trust what they're saying but I just can't.\n\nAny help thrown at me is ignored, counseling sessions, medication for anxiety, for stupid reasons. I'm scared. In my head, the problems are tangible, they are concrete, they can only be treated with medicine. Not talking it over or taking crazy pills.\n\nI don't even know where to start. Or where to end. Sooner or later this is going to catch up to me and take me away a lot sooner. My neglect of health, physical and mental, is getting worse everyday. My diet is so bad. If I'm not eating for days on end, it's always something like white rice and chicken...that's it. Nothing else. Everything scares me. Too much sugar, got to avoid that or I'll get *diabetes*\\--if I don't already have it. Too much salt, got to avoid that or I'll get *heart disease*\\--if I don't already have it. Too much cholesterol, definitely want to avoid that or I'll suffer a *heart attack or stroke-*\\-if I don't experience that soon. Too much spices, no can do--now I convinced myself I have *GERD* or stomach problems. I mean I have to, all the symptoms are there. And a doctor said it could be a *possibility*, not that I have it but that anyone can get it and that was half a year ago. So I must have it now, and why? Because someone posted a similar experience on Reddit that describes my current state and Google said so. Is it a stupid reason, obviously, but I convinced myself. It's not the fact that I went *three weeks* of not eating for days or *half a year* of eating poorly, ignoring fruits and vegetables. It's because I said so. And that's where I keep falling.\n\nI lost so much weight. And I can't accept that it has to do with me not eating or eating well. The pain I get, the discomfort, all over my body is screaming at me to get mental help, but I know nothing will change. Absolutely zero chances of actual progress. That at least I am certain. I don't want to eat anymore. I tried for a few days, trying to eat more and get out but I don't see the point. I'd rather give up on life. But I still got some fight left in me.\n\nThis isn't a cry for help, or anything like that. I see it, instead, as a brief discussion on whether or not my assumptions about my health are true or not.

It feels like my ears are ringing but there's no ringing in my ears. It's hard to describe. I can't describe it as ear ringing, I wouldn't describe it as dizziness, it's not painful so not a headache. Just that weird slightly disorienting feeling. It's like if you take ALL the symptoms or when your ears are ringing but there is no ringing in your ears. It's not painful or truly disorienting, but I can tell there's something different going on in my body.\n\nSome life factors that may be pertinent although I don't think they are connected:  \nMoved to a new office space just about a week ago. However, the symptoms seem to not favor home or work. I've also felt the symptoms while taking 15ish minute walks outdoors, so as far as I can tell it's not environmental.  \nI've been trying to practice intermittent fasting for at least maybe a month now but I'm not consistent with it. It's not a huge change to my eating habits anyway, since I haven't really had a habit of eating breakfast for years now. Only change I'm trying to stick to is not eating after 7:00 PM.  \nAlong with the diet change I've been trying to eat more vegetables, mainly spinach is the newest addition to my diet. Peppers and tomatoes I'm eating more of but I've always liked those and ate them on and off. As much as I'd like to say it, I'm not at the point where I've significantly cut down on my sugar intake but I've cut down a little.  \nI haven't gotten to the point where I am regularly exercising except for taking my 30-minute lunch break to walk around a few blocks. Nothing strenuous, not entirely sedentary. Most of my adult life has seen this consistently.  \nSleeping habits have not really changed much at all over the years.\n\nGoogle isn't helpful. Trying to google the symptoms just comes up with a ton of suggestions for tinnitus, but there's no actual ringing in my ears and my hearing is the same as it's always been.\n\nEDIT: I might also describe it as a lighter, but longer, feeling similar to when a roller coaster drops, or an elevator, or a dip in the road while driving. Also similar to the feeling of getting hit in the head/concussed, although not NEARLY as bad, and also I have not been hit in the head in recent memory.  \nAlso checked my heartbeat and pulse and both feel pretty normal.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Ever since then, I've needed to take a stool softener to legitimately go. I can go a little bit at a time, but it's just a few nuggets (lol). Also, It's been dark green for a month. There's also been a few instances where it came out really thin, which means I'm obviously inflamed. Also, I have horrible painful gas all day every day  unless I fast. The second anything hits my stomach, I bloat. This includes drinking water. It's ruining my life. I've never had any stomach issues before. I've been bodybuilding for years, so eating crazy amounts of food with zero issues. This was so sudden and random.\n\nAlso, If I don't \"go\" for like 2 days then take a stool softener, I have a MASSIVE green, mucousy poop. So things are obviously moving too fast through my system.

The most recent specialist has determined she has no allergies. Not a single one. She had zero reactions to her skin test. However, she suffers from chronic sinusitis.

People started to notice my balding when I was around 13/14, about the time I started puberty. I thought it would be same thing that I had when I was 11. When I was 11, I saw increased hair fall, with my hair itching. But it stopped, so I did not pay attention to it. So when I was 13/14, people started noticing bald spots. It was not that bad. Thinking it would end, I never cared. It just got worse and worse exponentially. When I turned 15, I noticed a medium sized spot on the mid-scalp region. I went to my dermatologist, they said it was just that I had long hair. Then it kept on going, and I turned 16. It got worse, then I chose to got to my primary doctor. After examining my hair, I had a lot of red spots on my scalp, and my scalp was a little itchy. They diagnosed me with dermatitis, and prescribed me selenium shampoo. It helped with the red spots, for a few weeks, but the spots ended up coming back. My scalp got more itchy after I using the medication. Then I went back, then they diagnosed me with folliculitis. They prescribed me minocycline to help with it. It did not help at all, so I went back to my dermatologist. At this point I had multiple patches of bald spots. The spots were on the side, and on the top of my scalp of my scalp. The weird thing is that there is still a little hair growing out of the spots which helps fill my hair. Also, I sometimes see white things when my hair falls out. It could be dandruff(I have some problem with dandruff) or dead skin. Another thing, that some of the hair strands have like a miniature black orb surrounding the end of the strand. Also sometimes, there is white coloring at the end of the hair. So back to my story, my dermatologist said I had alocepia areata and said I needed to use rogaine. They brushed off when I said about the red spots and the itching and the dandruff. I am not sure if that is the right thing?

I'm going to try my luck here on my odd condition.\nAbout myself: 22M, healthy lifestyle, I never smoke or drink. I have been doing weight training at the gym for a long time now, and have been occasionally sleeping with my air conditioning on. I believe you can help me diagnose my condition. \n\nSo about a less than decade ago, one morning I woke up in my bed, and suddenly this really loud cracking sound came out of my neck, I couldn't move my neck an inch without feeling intense pain.\n\nI was called an ambulance, given pain reduction treatment, and resumed to be able to move my neck again almost completely within two days.\n\nBut one thing didn't feel right even after I healed, and it still doesn't.\nEver since, my neck, or rather, the top of my spinal cord, has been feeling stiff, whenever I move my neck mildly to the sides, I can hear countless silent pops or cracks, as if something in my neck is constantly grinding. Some days it's better, sometimes it's worse. This does not restrict my movement albeit mild discomfort.\n\nOver the years I've come to learn that some things immediately make the pain in my neck worse. I've found the following to be porportionally related to my stiffness / pain / discomfort:\n\n- Apthaes, which are mouth/tongue sores, make my neck hurt significantly to an almost unbearable degree. If I apply mouthwash, then mid-wash, when the Apthaes hurt the most, so does my neck. Then post-wash, when the Aphtae is numb, the discomfort in my neck is better. I have no idea how these things relate.\n- Air Conditioning, when cold, makes my neck feel uneasy.\n- When I am thirsty, passive discomfort and stiffness becomes pain.\n\nSome things make my neck feel better, only to eventually return to its general stiffness in less than 2 minutes. Which oddly, are:\n\n- Doing plenty of crunches in fast pace make the stiffness in my neck temporarily go away completely for mere moments.\n- Sometimes actively causing pops in my neck where it is stiff loosens the stiffness a bit.\n- Sleeping with no pillow has contributed with feeling better.\n\nI have tried several treatments and attempts in diagnosing my condition, with no success at all:\n\n- MRI and CTs, with nothing irregular in the results, doctors say everything looks okay.\n- As no irregular results are shown from my tests, doctors can't pinpoint my issue and don't recommend surgery.\n- I have tried Chiropractic sessions with lots of different professionals over the years, Twi-Na, Shiatsu, and Neck messages too.\n- I have tried stopping weight training completely. This did not make my neck feel somewhat better.\n\nTld;r-  I have constant Mild Discomfort and Stiffness in the beginning of my spinal cord, at the back of my neck for 8 years now - after waking up one day with a huge 'pop' sound in my neck. No idea why this happened, or what this is.\n\nEdit: Added more information.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Got a call a couple days later to switch antibiotics, but it didn't clear up after a few days, so I finally went to my regular GP for another antiobiotic to clear up the infection.  Went through the antibiotics but still didn't feel right.\n\nI only have one noticeable symptom that has persisted-- pain that I believe to be my kidneys on both sides (my docs keep referring to it as \"flank pain\").  The pain comes and goes.  It feels warm-hot and I feel a spasm sensation.  At its worst I was crying in fetal position for 20 minutes.  Most of the time it's a 1 or a 2 on the pain scale.  It's generally felt on one side more, but the side changes.  \n\nUrologists did CT scans, blood and urine tests, dye tests on my kidneys.  No stones, no cancers, nothing remarkable.   \nKidneys are perfectly fine they say.  No signs of infection.\n\nThey did a scope and saw that I have cystitis (inflammation in the lining of the bladder).

Each time I went to urgent care they would prescribe me steroids and antibiotics. Recently, symptoms have prevented me from going to class, and caused sleeping for up to 20 hours at a time. I dropped a class in the spring because I couldn't handle my coursework. I have recently begun experiencing frequent lightheaded spells that force me to the ground and faint once.

I get tremors, my heart beat gets hard and fast, sometimes my hands and feet will go partially numb, I get a headache, and I feel more hungry than before. My weight, as listed above, has always been low, and my doctors arnt particularly worried about it, since I am a very small person in general. I want to gain weight, though, and ive been trying, but sometimes its hard to get myself to eat because of how bad I will feel afterwards. I will feel like my stomach is empty, but also food becomes very unappealing. I eat around 1200-1800 calories a day, and my meals are generally healthy, whole foods, high protein, etc. I eat three meals a day, usually at the same time each day, and have the occasional snack. This mostly happens after lunch or dinner, and the onset is almost immediate, 5-15 minutes after starting the meal. My heart will begin beating very hard I will feel light headed. From what Ive read, it fits hypoglycemia, but that is usually caused by not eating for a while, right? About 3 years ago I developed narcolepsy, and thats what I take the Adderall for. I suspected the meds might have been causing it (or making it worse, since ive had this feeling for much longer) but it seems to make no difference if I take my Adderall or not. Im really not sure what to do about this. Im trying real hard to eat more, but I cant eat much more than I am now without making myself sick. I would also like to note that in the process of diagnosing my narcolepsy, I got blood tests regularly and they never made a comment about blood sugar, and I dont seem to have any nutritional deficiencies.

When I got off the plane I was fine and slept normally in my own location for two days. Then one day I had chinese food and the tension headache came back and I attributed it to high salt intake since if I tend to take a lot of salt my heart rate speeds a bit and I get tension in my head soemtimes. I also had gas and bloating. That night I had insomnia and ended up not being able to sleep until 5, and only slept until 9 am and couldn't sleep more . I attributed that to the headache and tension issues. The next day I decided I'm not eating any salt and eating light foods and my headaches dissipitated and my heart rate was slower - that was good. But then the insomnia persisted - and  I didn't sleep until 6 am , and woke up at 10 am  the next day and I originallt thought it was my body clock off due to the insomnia caused by salt the night before, and once my body woke up at ten am I could not sleep again at all. Each day this progressively got worse- I cut off all electronics 3 hours before bed, meditated ,read under candlight to avoid artificial light, drank hot milk and I could not sleep, If I laid down I'd get an extremely light sleep and that was it- where I was still aware of my surrounding. For some reason when the sun rose I suddenly felt sleepy , and once again I was asleep from 5-10 am and had REM sleep because I remembered my dreams.

In addition, for over a decade now since 2008 (probably 2009) I dealt (still deal) with *phlegm*.\n\n**Family Medical History**: Recently my grandmother passed away from \\*cancer--*she was hospitalized late July of 2018 and passed in October of 2018*\\--\\*while she also suffered from *diabetes* and was a *hypochondriac*.

I weigh about... maybe 145, that was my last measurement less than two weeks ago. I started working out last August (around the same time I noticed changes), running four days out of the week, going to the gym three days out of the week, for about 5 months. In that period, I lost about 10-15 pounds, going from 180 to 170. Ever since then my diet and exercise has been non-existent.\n\nLast night and the previous night, I suffered either a near heart attack or just an anxiety episode. It felt like every time I tried to fall asleep, my body would jolt back up because my breathing grew difficult and I couldn't feel my heart beat. I was close, less than a second away, from getting up and rushing to the hospital. But it went away and I don't want to experience that again. I'm at the point right now where it's just becoming a burden, where I feel like a burden and that all I want to do is sleep away my life.\n\nIt doesn't feel like what's causing this is anxiety or depression or even ocd. I'm certain, beyond positive, that what I have is *hypertension*\\--low and high blood pressure, *GERD* or *crohn's disease*, definitely something related to my stomach, *nerve damage*, *heart disease*, *IBS* and most likely *diabetes*.\n\nA couple of doctors and nurses claimed that my livers or kidneys were functioning normal when I did various urine tests, but if I pee frequently then it really doesn't add up. Same thing for the high/low blood pressure and *heart disease*, a nurse at the USC laughed when I mentioned it saying how I was too young and that my bp spiked due to stress and me panicking--which doesn't make sense. And my old doctor, before I switched, said that what I have or could have is *GERD* or *acid reflux*, while they never confirmed it, \"anyone can get it\" that's what my old doctor said. Plus they gave me some medicine for that, even though it didn't do anything for me.

Besides having low vitamin D--which is known to be linked to various illnesses like *cancers* and *heart defects* and *diabetes*, no one seems to believe me.\n\nTomorrow I have a followup with my primary doctor because I missed last weeks, and I want to request further tests.

Not a phone buzzing, but like if you hit a window, that small vibration is on my skin. It would happen on campus when I studied, so I would take a walk thinking I sat too long, but it never helped. Sometimes to go along with that, it would feel like there were spider webs on my arms. This would happen every month or so. As soon as I started seeing the doctor in March/April it just became the sensations in my feet I just described earlier and my legs had been fine since, except for one single day at some point. And this was intermittent but is getting to be frequent\n\nI've went for 2 blood tests to check my thyroid and kidney stuff. I had an ultrasound and an X-ray on my feet. Everything was normal. I have an appointment at an EMG clinic next month.\n\nI was just curious on anybody's thoughts. I'm not worried about it, but it is so distracting when I had studied or when I go to the store.

At first i really thought nothing of it. I thought that it would undoubtedly pass and i would be fine the next day. I was wrong. So a few days go by and i'm still getting these burps but not so much getting the pains. The problem is that the burps are sooo extremely excessive. Im talking like 50 to 100 times a day. So basically i'm left feeling extremely uncomfortable all day because if im not burping im left feeling like i need to burp and the build up eventually becomes painful if im not able to get one out for relief. It feels like i'm bloated to the max and am seconds away from exploding... Ive done a lot of research of my own and found a number of things that it could be. A couple of the most consistent things ive found are: Acid Reflux (GERD), Stomach Ulcers, or Aerophagia. I went to the doctor yesterday and she said that she thinks that it is Acid Reflux but im not convinced because besides that first day i havent really experienced much of anything other than what feels like a gas issue. No heartburn, no chest pains for the most part, no bile regurgitation for the most part and the fact that is all day every day pretty much since i discovered this. Another thing is not only am i burping but im also farting a bunch and i feel some type of relief from that. That doesnt sound like acid reflux to me. the fact that i am burping and farting extremely excessively after eating almost nothing all day to prevent my symptoms from being worse than they already are, leads me to believe that it's some major gas problem of some sort. My doctor prescribed some sort of medicine for Acid Reflux, Gastritus, and conditions alike and told me to use for 2 weeks and if it doesnt seem to work go back to her. but honestly its hard for me to go through this for another day because im left feeling so uncomfortable all day long from what feels like horrible gas build up. Im started to get really worried and just want to know what's wrong with me. Im considering going to the ER tonight if i feel remotely similar to how i felt last night. The feeling i described earlier as feeling like i was about to explode from bloatedness . I would really appreciate any tips or suggestions anybody has for me on what this could be or what course of action i should be taking to get this to stop. im desperate and really need help...

What do?", "author": "surb2020", "self_text": "whats up reddit?  Hopefully you can help me with some medical troubles I\u2019ve been experiencing the past few months.Male, 29 history of prehypertension and chronic asthma / sinusitis, about 20 lbs overweight but overall in OK shape, currently take losaratan with hctz, advair, zyrtec, flonase.  First started late April, I was on vacation with my wife and kids and we were hanging out at the pool.  Just had not a not so great dinner of cheeseburger and onion rings with alcohol and suddenly feel like I am going to faint, I go to sit down by my wife on the side of the pool.  When i sit down my heart goes into arrithmyia and starts beating super fast, I grab her hand and put it on my chest because I\u2019m freaking out and feel like I can\u2019t talk.  Her, being a nurse, tells me to grab the chair arms and bear down, which I do and my heart slows down.  Rest of the night I feel pretty anxiou/shaky becauxe I\u2019m thinking I had a heart attack or something, next morning I go on a 4 mile jog (about my normal run) and everything is OK and overall that day I am OK except for just feeling overall fatigued and light headed and still anxious from what happened.  The following day (2 days removed from episode) we are back home and I go to my GP who does an EKG and blood test, says everything looks OK.  Hooks me up to a 24 hour heart monitor, refers me to cardiologist.\n\nCardiologist puts me through a stress test, pass with flying colors.  They tell me body and heart are in great shape, lose 20 and see you in a year.  Slightly elevated BP during the stress test, not uncommon since I had been under a lot of stress and anxiety.  Still feeling fatigued/light headed on and off pretty much everyday, back to GP.  She says I have fluid in my ears and tells me I have been having vertigo, that is why I am light headed and fatigued and at the beach I probably had a panic attack when I was feeling dizzy for the first time.  Sure, makes sense.  On to the ENT.\n\nENT I have been seeing for about 6 years does an ear pressure test and tells me I have sinus polyps all up in my nasal cavity and have fluid in my ears, advises surgery to remove and we will do tubes in my ears at the same time to get things moving.  12 day run of steroids and antibiotics in the meantime, then another 12 day run to start 3 days before surgery.  At this point it is the first week of June, my surgery is scheduled the first week of August.  I take the summer off with my kids (as I had planned since before I got sick) so I am staying home with my kids and working from home and I just feel awful on a day to day basis pretty much all of June-July, fatigue and light headedness still.  \n\nAbout two weeks before my surgery I start feeling tingling in my hands and feet, on and off.  Sometimes it is not there at all, sometimes it just feels like a prick, sometimes I feel it from my toes all the way up to my knees, from my fingers up past my elbows and even kind of in my teeth/face.  I call ENT and ask if this is possibly related to polyps, he says no so I follow up with GP.  She says sounds like diabetes, does blood test which comes back normal.  I check my sugars, fasting and after meals, for 4 days and everything is normal.  I figure it might just be anxiety, as I\u2019m feeling awful everyday and kind of waiting for my sinus surgery to happen.  I stop going to the gym at this point, feel like I am not sleeping at night, just overall not feeling good.\n\nFirst week of August, finally have surgery.  ENT does not do tubes because he says the steroids have cleared the fluid, and tubes are easy to do in-office later if I need them.  Surgery goes fine, I feel extra fatigued for a week and half I assume because of anesthesia, nasal passageways are clear.  2 weeks ago, kids go back to school and I start working in an office, I catch a cold and have nasal congestion and mucus, on top of surgery drainage and overall fatigue/lightheadness that supposedly surgery was going to fix.  Still experiencing tingling in hands and feet, not everyday but several times a week.\n\nBegin to self diagnose to get over exhaustion and tingling, thinking it might be losartan hctz side effect.  I have been on the med for 6 years at this point.  Call my GP, she gives me amlodapine and says take that and half a losartan, I also start going back to the gym at this point.  Overall feeling a little better, still suffering from random fatigue, light headedness and tingling.  Kind of feel like I get hit by a bus randomly, and then it goes away out of nowhere.  I am functional at my new job, which was my biggest concern going back to work.\n\nI went to the ENT for post-op last week with my cold, and I even tell him I have a cold.  He takes a look at my sinuses and sucks a ton of junk out, then says I am having congestion again.  He wants me to start on a daily steroid rinse (which I still have not received in the mail) and a 6 week run of steroids, which I have not filled yet because it seems excessive and I hate being on steroids.  6 weeks would be the longest I have ever taken them before.  I\u2019m debating starting them when I get the steroid rinse and maybe trying a 2 week run to see how I feel...  Over the weekend and into yesterday and today my nose passageways feel pretty clear, right nostril is a little constricted but honestly has always felt like that my entire life.  Definitely have fluid/pressure back in my ears.\n\nJust trying to figure out what I need to do to get myself to feeling OK on a regular basis.  IMO the lightheadedness, fatigue and tingling did not go away even when I was on steroids so I\u2019m wondering if they are even sinus related at all at this point.  I wish the doctor would have put my tubes in so that at least I could cross that off the list of culprits.  I have had sinus issues my entire life, this sinus surgery a few weeks ago was my 4th since I was 16.  This is the longest I have gone since high school, my last surgery was 2012.  I\u2019ve never had symptoms of vertigo and tingling related to sinuses in the past, where should I be looking next?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

He is resentful of his own life for the lack of turmoil he has faced. He's intelligent, charming, athletic and funny with a loving family and good friends. Essentially, he feels his life has been \"too perfect\"-- that he does not deserve what he has. This creates genuine anger for him. He's very pro-conflict and adversarial. He feels as though there is this wall built up of this anger and resentment that he can't get over. There's always a response that he *wants* to say which is polite, supportive and loving. But usually this response gets blocked by the barrier and lands up being more abrasive than he intended. He has an intense need for power and control, yet he cannot seem to control these behaviours.\n\nDoes anyone have experience this? What kind of counselling would you recommend for working through this? It is excruciatingly painful. He talks of wanting to go to war just to feel like he's surmounted an obstacle. I fear that it's a longing for pain or self-sabotage. He seems depressed as well-- self rating his happiness at a 4/10. How can he get the help he needs to live the life of happiness that he deserves?

I live in a \"country in development\" so healthcare here isn't the best and doesn't bother with patients like me. TL;DR on the bottom.\n\nI am a 23 year old female with no medical history of any serious illness. I have also been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and panic attacks for the past six years but haven't been placed on any medication and only go to a therapist 2-3 times a month.\n\nIn the last few years I have been experiencing nausea every morning. Sometimes mild but sometimes it comes in bad spells. Going to classes at my university is the hardest thing because I'd had to run to the bathroom in horrible pain and feel like I am going to pass out only to be fine in few minutes.\n\nI try to eat and drink every morning as I was told but eating only makes this worse. My blood pressure during the day is 90/60 and no matter how much water and/or salt I take it stays this way until 3PM. My normal blood pressure is like 110/80 I generally don't go higher than that.\n\nAlso I get these spells of fatigue where I can barely stay awake on class even with 8 hours of sleep or I feel like there's a bowling ball in my head that's weighing me down in place whenever I try to move my head or body. \n\nThese events made my anxiety worse and I began skipping classes and failed quite a few because I am afraid these symptoms will come or that I will faint. I opted out of vacation with my friends and spent my whole summer indoors because I am so afraid of being nauseous again. I spent the last few years running to doctors and everything always came back normal, bloodwork, hormone levels, thyroid. All doctors say \"It's stress\" but no one gave me any solution. I've tried taking vitamins, other expensive over the counter \"medicine\" but nothing helps.\n\nThe only thing I ended up learning is that these things don't happen if I wake up after 12PM and don't eat until 6PM. So I started going to bed at 5AM and sleeping till 1 or 2PM just to avoid the scary symptom period. In fact somehow I am perfectly fine at night. But I am starting my semester soon and I'll eventually graduate and will have to work so I can't keep going like this. I am seriously at the end of my line here. I tried going to bed early and waking up early for few days and the same symptoms returned even after 10 hours of sleep. As if my body refuses to be up before 12.\n\nI turn to you guys on reddit if you can tell me where to look for a solution because I am tired of suffering like this and being dismissed by every doctor I went to.\n\nTL;DR\n- 23 / female\n- no medical history except anxiety, no medication\n- constant daily nausea and stomach cramps\n- low blood pressure during the day\n- had tests done that came normal\n- believe is sleep related since symptoms don't appear if I sleep past 12PM and don't eat anything", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

There   seems to be a shooting pain that goes from my hip to my upper right of   my leg depending on how I move it around, I feel like I need to  stretch  out my leg or have it manipulated in a way that will pop it  back in  place.\n4. I frequently end up with a pain in my lower right back.\n\nA few other random notes that may or may not be related to this...\n\n1.

The back of my mouth had these small sores/ulcers that seemed to appear out of no where and the pain was searing. I couldn't focus on my work and in a few short hours they had developed inside my entire mouth.\n\nI left work early to see my dentist thinking it was something related to that perhaps an infection or something.\n\nHe tells me to brush my teeth more often and do saltwater rinses and that it's just due to poor hygiene. (I do not floss often)\n\nI take him for his word. He tells me my lips are bleeding gives me a tissue and I head out of the dentist office. When I get back home(I walk everywhere) and look in the mirror it looks like my lips are melting off. This raises my concern even more and I  immediately head to a walk in clinic where a doctor tells me I've gotten mucositis.\n\nThis is something patients receiving chemotherapy get, at this point I have no idea how I got it. She prescribes me some lidocaine rinse and different eye drops to help with the pain and keep the symptoms as bay. She tells me not to go to work for the next 3-4 days and writes me a note.\n\nMy symptoms continue to worsen and I end up going to the hospital where I get admitted while doctors try to figure out what's wrong with me. I was in the worst pain of my life, all the inside of my mouth was sloughing off  and my eyes were swollen and gooey beyond belief.\n\nGI &amp; dermatology run tests and small procedures but absolutely cannot figure out what is causing my symptoms. Eventually dermatology believes it was mycoplasma pneumoniae induced mucositis but have no idea how it happened.\n\nThey said my body had some kind of reaction.\n\nI get discharged from the hospital and am on sick leave from work for about a month(i work in a nursing home and my mouth was an open wound so they advised I stayed out of work to heal), I saw the doctors once a week to monitor my recovery for about 4 weeks and slowly over time everything went back to normal.\n\nWell, about 2 weeks ago, my eyes became swollen, itchy and began producing discharge again, and since about a week ago 2 sores have developed in my mouth that are very painful.\n\nIt's a lot more mild than what happened last time but it's the exact same thing, I have seen my primary care doctor last week but she has no idea what this could be and is monitoring how this progresses.\n\nThankfully this is nowhere near as bad as the last time, in just a few days my mouth was basically melting away and it's been two weeks this time around and it's made very little progress. I do not want to downplay it though, this is serious and I want to know what this may be or what direction I need to go in to find out what may be causing this response or if it's a condition.\n\nThe one thing I can think of is...\n\nI was homeless about 2 years ago, I was able to get on my feet and rent a basement now. I am in the process of building a business and my rent is cheap which helps me fund my business however there is an abnormal amount of mold in this basement and I am beginning to wonder if this could be causing all of this.\n\nWhen I say abnormal amount of mold, I cannot even store non-perishable items, in 24-48 hours bread would have mold growing on it, same with opened jars of peanut butter or super marker rotisserie chicken.\n\nOther than that I have no idea what could possible cause my body to respond this way twice when I have never had this type of problem before.\n\nAs far as past medical history I have had a diagnoses of lyme and mono over a decade ago, and currently have ulcerative colitis. I'm pretty healthy all things considered. I wonder if there is a correlation between this and my colitis as well.\n\nI look forward to your responses and know that this will be resolved.\n\nYour help is greatly appreciated.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Getting contradicting opinions from doctors.", "author": "RollingGolding", "self_text": "North Europe, female, 25 years of age, 5'8\", 120ish lbs, no medications, no smoking, vegan lifestyle, no outstanding medical issues.\n\nAbout one and a half month ago we found a tick on my GF. On the goddamn nipple, of all places. Took it off smoothly, asked our general practitioner (Doctor 1) what to do, she said just sit tight and monitor for symptoms, since there's no way the disease would show up in early bloodwork.\n\nGF didn't have any symptoms. No red rash circle. Just a little - maybe half an inch wide - red-ish bump at the bite spot for a few weeks, but no rash (sorry, didn't get a pick, it's long gone now). Doctor 1 looked at the bump and didn't identify it as a rash, intensive googling indicated that a bump after a bite is normal and that there is quite a difference between a post-bite bump and the real \"bullseye\" rash of lyme disease.\n\nEither way, we waited for one and a half month. There were no symptoms, other than a headache for two days or so, but we didn't make much of it since GF has had periodic migraines for all of her life.\n\nWe did bloodwork test two days ago.\n\nBorrelia burgdorferi IgM tested 18.2 AU/mL (indicated norm is &lt;18, so just slightly more) and IgG tested 80 AU/mL (indicated norm is &lt;10, so eight times the norm).\n\nNurse of Doctor 1 told that it looks like GF's immune system beat the disease, which at the time sounded weird, because I've never heard of someone beating Lyme disease on his own. I thought you mostly needed antibiotic intervention to cure it. She said that IgM relates to the current disease activity or something and IgG notes of post-disease recovery? I don't know.\n\nAfter GF got to Doctor 1, she said that with such bloodwork results nobody would put my GF on antibiotics and she also thought that GF went through the disease by herself and that since she's had no symptoms, she doesn't think we should use antibiotics. GF agreed and said that she doesnt quite wish to nuke her immune system with antibiotics.\n\nAll of this didn't sit too well with me, especially knowing how serious Lyme disease can get, how it's hard to treat once it's been there for years, but easy to treat in the early stages, so I asked GF to get a second opinion. Doctor 1 didn't leave me an impression of absolute trust.\n\nDoctor 2 was from an infectology center and he had the opinion that my GF never even had the disease. To my question if a person can beat a Lyme disease on its own he conclusively said \"no way\" and then explained that bloodwork results regarding Lyme disease are highly unreliable and since there were no symptoms, he doubts GF ever had Lyme. He couldn't quite explain in laymans terms why would a bloodwork test still indicate the disease as positive if a person has never had it and he suggested that there is a second type of test that can be done to verify the disease, but it's really expensive and not covered by state healthcare and since GF has had no symptoms, we're thinking if we should drop such money on such test.\n\nCan any doctor here give a third input on Doctor 1 and Doctor 2 thoughts and Lyme disease in general and what we should do?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I couldn't put any pressure on it at all or move it. It was extremely swollen around my kneecap after an hour. I had an x-ray of my knee.\n\nBetween- I had a brace on and it hurt really bad when I moved it for about a week. (pain lessened afterwards.)\n\nAbout 2 week later- After a few x-rays and simple tests the doctor said that I had fractured it. The x ray shown a small bit of the bone on the side of my kneecap had come off between x-rays. The doctor said it was just a fracture and should be okay after about a month or two. \n\nI was delighted with this news. The last thing I wanted was muscle damage / an ACL tear etc. this would stop me from doing what I want to do as a career. \n\nNow~4 months later- My knee hurts slightly when I do straight leg raises. I can leg press heavy amounts and it doesn't hurt at all. After walking or exercising my leg throughout the day when I try to do a straight leg raise it will hurt quite badly. \n\n   I cannot run.   \nI tried jogging for about 10 seconds a week ago. My knee felt very loose and hurt. It was quite a strange feeling. After that my knee hurt for a while after.\n\nWhen performing squats my knee will mildly hurt- nothing stopping me from continuing and my knee will hurt for a very short period after.\n\nWhen riding a bike my knee doesn't hurt at all however if I were to stand up whilst riding it would hurt a fair bit.\n\nI would really help if anyone could tell me what they think is wrong with my knee. I really don't want to go to a doctor because if something is wrong with my knee it would go on my medical record and that would completely bar me from doing what I want to do in the future. This sounds ridiculous, but I'm really passionate and focused on this career and if I can't pursue it I will be devastated.\n\nSorry for the long read and thankyou.\n\nEdit: I have a video of the moment I injured my knee if it would help.

In January, my condition took a turn for the worse as the pain got sharper, affecting both my upper abdomen and chest, and got longer lasting, the nausea got more intense (between the two I sometimes end up throwing up whatever I'd eaten, due to pain, nausea, or both) and I would get very tired after eating.

I have been hyper sensitive to my heart beat in my chest/neck/sinus. Like, 24/7. I've had spells where I feel light-headed with a tight chest. My sinus just behind the bridge of my nose has been clogged for *FOUR* months - evert day - and I have never had an allergy. I can breathe okay and taste food, but solid pressure just behind the nose. No pain on forehead or under eyes. I get slight jumps in heart rate for no reason (from my oddly low resting heart rate of about 50 up to 60 or so). Not huge but noticeable. I feel blood pulsing in my chest/neck/sinus when this happens. I don't feel short of breath but my lungs feel \"sore\", or maybe a pressure, mostly middle chest but seems to radiate out to the side of my pecs toward my armpits, mostly right side. I have a productive cough a dozen times a day with mucous (clear to yellow). Occasional facial tingles, once in a while arms and legs too but not as often. I get the odd head flush while sitting still. I tried Flonase, Claritin, Benadryl and Sudafed and nothing seems to make a difference at all. I'm tired of feeling so odd all day, every day. I went from 100% healthy to this and want to get it solved. \n\n* Doctor #1 (Kaiser) did chest and sinus X-rays and gave Augmentin for five days. Said X-rays were with \"normal findings\" and the antibiotics did nothing. No changes in condition, went back again. \n* Doctor #2 (Kaiser) heard a murmur in exam so ordered stress test and echocardiogram. Stress was normal, echo showed slight enlargement of the upper chamber but requires \"no further intervention\". So not a cardiac issue (unless a CT scan would show something different?). No changes in condition, emailed doctor:\n* I asked to see an ENT and for a panel of blood/urine tests to rule out anything else, but he seems to be dragging his feet.\n* I am *wide* open to this being some sort of anxiety issue but it really doesn't fit with my situation and what I've been reading. It's constant and I don't have major, debilitating waves or attacks; I have no trouble going out and about. I feel like I have an infection that has moved in and getting comfortable. I need to remove physiological causes from the list before I go down this road. \n* I keep leaning to some lung issue (mold allergy/fungus/virus/other) connected to the sinus thing. Thyroid maybe, although I don't have many of those symptoms. Maybe a reaction to dust from the construction in our backyard (although it's been going on for over a year now). I feel like we're not turning over all the stones, and Kaiser isn't leading the charge.\n* Basically Kaiser is good for cuts and scrapes but you have to fight like hell to get tests and screenings to get to the bottom of stranger illnesses. They just want you in and out and allow weeks and weeks to pass between visits. \n\n***Thanks in advance for any ideas to add to my list.   :)***", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I have in the past taken drugs like Ecstasy and Mushrooms and Cocaine but my use was limited for a few years at most and haven't done anything in over 8 years since my son was born. I have a medical marijuana card and do smoke when I'm depressed which may be a few times a week. I've also had my appendix removal. \n\nThanks for anything you guys can provide and bless you all!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I can only hope that someone here can help.\n\n25F, 250lbs, 5'4\", White, US Arizona. Pre existing issues with Kidneys. Have since been fixed with a surgery when I was 9, still prone to UTIs, however. Taking gabapentin, bupropion, and many other supplements.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis started back in 2014/15, not entirely sure. I lived in Wyoming at the time, and this is when I first started getting the issue badly. With no prior warning, I would get severe chest pain, it would hurt to breathe, I would become massively fatigued and at this time, only slightly nauseated/not hungry. This would last me days and I would be bedridden. Changing positions from laying to sitting or standing would be *agonizing*. I would be sleeping for upwards to 20 hours a day, maybe getting up to go to the bathroom. After a few days, or even a week or more, I would slowly come back out of the issue and would be fine. I had no idea what this was, STILL don't know and brushed it off as a Histoplasmosis relapse (I contracted it at around 10 years old from bird droppings).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAS the years go by I still have this issue. Moved from Wyoming to Michigan, then to Kentucky, and back up to Ohio. Things didn't start back up until 2016 when I was living in Ohio, when I had two bouts in that year. Largely the same symptoms, nothing really changed, minus gaining weakness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2017 came around, late that year I moved into a new place and my roommates had cats....6 to be exact. And their litter box was in my bathroom. It ALWAYS stank. Something about it made my chest issue go into overdrive. I was down from it for 3 MONTHS. I lost my job because of it. Had to move back with my parents because of it. To this day I feel awful because I promised I would pay rent for my roommates...they were understandably pissed, but there was legit nothing I could do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe rest of 2017-early 2018, I was having a bout every month. My last one was Feb of 18. In that time it kicked it up a notch again and suddenly I was unable to eat or drink, and without medication I would be constantly vomiting. I was seeing the doctor (NP which to this day I'm positive she thinks I was faking it, now I can't trust NPs) once every time I had an issue, not to mention the countless ER visits I was getting from day 1 of this issue. Now, if you know Histoplasmosis, it can typically leave scarring on your chest from the fungal infection. I had several x-rays, MRIs, CT scans and the like, and not once did they notice any scarring. In fact, they couldn't see anything! It was as if it was in my head. I can promise you it was not. There was no change in whether or not I got it if I was stressed or relaxed. It was so sensitive in early 2018 that something as simple as smelling a lotion would set me off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn this time I had blood tests done, and after a while they noticed my Sedimentation rate, C Reactive-protein and Rhumetoid Factor were all high, indicating inflammation and autoimmune issues. Okay, step one right? NO. To this day, we have not pinpointed the exact reason for any of this, minus Fybromyalgia. I was formally diagnosed earlier this year. I have seen a miryad of specialists. \n\nHeart? No.\n\nLungs? No. \n\nSleep Apnea? No.\n\nThyroid? No.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven seen a Rhumetologist. She said \"hm, that's definately very high, let's get that number down, but everything you describe to me isn't my line of work, sorry, go see someone else\" Did a few quick presses, confirmed Fibro and sent me on my way. Never went back to her (Again, NP.). Never even bothered to listen to me, quickly shut down my concerns. This was this year!  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I'm at my wits end. I haven't had a serious bout since early 2018, but considering my history, I'm expecting it to pick back up again next year. If anyone has any advice, clues, ANYTHING. I am open to hearing it. My RF has been consistently 60 or higher for at least the past 5 years. MY health has suffered from this.

I'm a 23 year old male, 170lbs 6 foot 2 which was otherwise in above average physical health when symptoms started. I know all at once this will be confusing so I'll get to where doctors and I have gotten to now.  I have been all over the place trying to get this issue fixed for about 3 years with the more serious symptoms happening in the past 1 - 1.5 years but imaging has ruled out anything serious from my brain, spine, and shoulders. I have never had my pelvis, legs, or abdominal area imaged. So far the cause has pretty much been narrowed down to my pelvic area but I still don't have a diagnosis. I'll describe everything I feel, list surgeries, what provides relief, doctors I've seen, lifestyle, imaging/tests I've had done Symptoms and pictures. Right now we are focused on my pelvis as that is where the most doctors and PTs have said is the root cause and I would say feels right. My general physician who I have been with since maybe 2002 thinks it could be a rupture somewhere or nerve entrapment somewhere in my pelvis. I saw him last Friday where I updated him on everything that had been going on. He checked my left hernia site and said it felt like I may have ruptured something after finding the area \"not smooth\" (poked his finger up my scrotum to feel the site) and that that is weird for my age. Personally the entire area feels different to me and I no longer feel that push down from my muscles when doing the cough test for a hernia. I have been going to a physical therapy office where there are four different specialists I have been working with. One found that my sacrum seems to be out of place. Everything else I feel has been for the most part imaged and cleared of any serious issue.\n\n# Overall Symptoms:\n\nGallery\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/5zz1j4ax8sd31.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zz7mvjax8sd31.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/44cqwdax8sd31.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/mpbqjdax8sd31.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/6opvadax8sd31.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/nbtmudax8sd31.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/bgmigkax8sd31.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/9c54iuax8sd31.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/danjskax8sd31.jpg\n\n**Arm/shoulder:**\n\n* Overhead movements feel wrong, lifting overhand with my left side sucks. Feels like I have less support from muscles in my lats and upper back and makes lifting overall too difficult to do.\n* I feel pain in my left elbow where the ulnar nerve is. Like a sharp achy feeling similar an inflamed feeling that I also feel on the pinky side of my wrist before the line of my hand. Sometimes my pinky and ring finger will go cold while the other two stay warm. My physical therapists thinks it's like an intermittent thoracic outlet syndrome.\n* When I was still working out one of the first symptoms was noticing that my left lat wasn't participating as much as it had before and had overall weakness and feeling of impingement in my shoulder when doing any overhead movements. Basically pullups no longer felt right and I stopped progressing on push exercises.\n\n**Abdominal/Chest:**\n\n* Left side of my rib cage is slightly flared, with tightness in my upper left chest\n* Left lower ribs make clicking noises when leaning forwards or sideways\n* Left abs no longer feel stable\n* Sternum can now crack when before I never could\n* I can't twist and crack my back if I twist to the left\n\n**Neck/Head:**\n\n* Vision feels like its at a constant 90%, almost like its hard to focus or track with my eyes. Like they cant relax.\n* Any anxiety I feel is as a result of the onset of the suboccipital tightness and overall foggy feeling in my head. The first doctor I saw on referral was a therapist because I was told it was just anxiety. I stayed with him for three months before he cleared me saying I was mentally fine albeit stressed. When the onset of the neck feeling happened, I had been bridging and felt a pop somewhere in my pelvic area and I immediately started having panic attack like symptoms. I had a handful more before I learned to recognize the symptoms and that they were produced by my issue not stress. I have never had anxiety prior to the overall issue and always dealt very well with stress.\n* I have a constant suboccipital tension, feeling like my neck is tense and being twisted but deep inside.\n* All the muscles of the front of my neck have weakened and scalenes are now super tight (noticed by the PT)\n* The muscles on the left side of my face and skull often feel weird and I sense movement and flexion. Massaging the muscles on thee right side of my skull sometimes eases the muscles. One of my PTs has said that she noticed the muscles in my face both look and feel uneven with the left side having a slight pulled down look and I feel that. The muscles between my left and right jaw feel wrong and very weak. Like my tongue is resting in mid air almost. When looking up the muscles of the front of my neck feel wrong and too tight. Often movement of my neck produces popping like my trachea is pushing past muscles.\n* Trouble swallowing and breathing. When my lungs are full it feels easier to swallow. My throat muscles in general feel weird.\n* My PTs have pretty much all said that by SNS system is in overdrive but to me it feels like whatever this is causes that\n* One of the PTs have also noticed that my diaphragm on my left side isn't doing much and it definitely feels like it. If I go for a run and focus on keeping my pelvis and legs even I can feel it start to activate and stops when I don't get it just right\n* TMJ issues\n\n**Legs/Pelvis**\n\n* Overall the muscles of left leg feel wrong and out of place like my left pelvis is being pushed backwards and up which has made my upper quads pretty much useless\n* When moving my leg around I feel a lot of popping and crunch/multiple pop feeling like ligaments running over a bump on my inner thigh where it connects to my pelvis, around my sitbone, and on the outside of my leg\n* Sports Medicine Ortho has noticed that when holding my quad down in a supine position I can't lift my leg straight up. Like my legs aren't receiving the signal.\n* When sitting my sit bones feel very out of place\n* When sitting against a hard seat like on the train its accentuated and I feel my spine or pelvis pushing into the back of the seat\n* When I would do leg presses it felt like I couldn't hold my left pelvis in place in turn making it feel like it would push backwards into the seat\n* When stepping if I put to much weight over the area under my pinky toe knuckle it hurts in a sharp bruised kind of way\n* Circulation to feet sucks\n* Foot drop left side\n* Sometimes get streaks of cold down my shins and a gurgly feeling in the arch of my foot near the big toe\n* Started getting flat foot on my left side\n* Knee troubles\n* Tingly feeling at the top of my leg near the anterior superior iliac spine\n* Big indent above penis easier felt than seen\n* There is pain in my inner left thigh where I feel a tight thin band. The muscles in that same area feel\n* Feels like my hamstring on my left side doesn't flex. When palpating I fee, really tight lines of muscle.\n* feels like the muscles below my waist all the way to my penis are all not doing anything. I can't flex them anymore hence the lack of pushing feeling during the hernia cough test. The muscles look wrong to me and lumpy? I'm pretty numb on most of the left side.\n* Sitting on the toilet sometimes brings on the worst of the overall tension and dizzy confused feeling. My heart will race and it feels almost like what the symptoms of high blood pressure feel like.\n* I have a swollen feeling in my perineum\n* I fart a lot more now and feel a lot of squelching in the front of my pelvis and back near my tailbone\n* When hanging in a pull and/or chin up position and relaxing, it feels like the front of my left waist gets caught or hitched on itself and won't expand relax like on the right side causing my arm to start to go numb as the upper back muscles on my left side do nothing to help.\n* When feeling out the back of my pelvis there is much more space between my spine and right pelvis than on the left and the left side feels very bumpy right is smooth. The spot where my buttcrack starts feels wrong and has an indent.\n\n# What Gives Me Relief\n\n* What gives me hope is that every single symptom I've listed has gone away twice while doing the exact same stretch but I've got maybe a 1% success rate. The first time it happened by accident in the gym while sitting at the edge of a bench with my legs flexed and together(this doesn't ever feel as it should but this time it felt like the muscles were all weakly holding their place), heels up on the rolling part. I was holding two 20lbs and leaned forward over my legs in this position with my chin tucked and I held it while I tried to find a comfortable grip. I started to get a releasing feeling in my back and suddenly in like a chain reaction I felt my lower back and shoulder chunk into place and suddenly everything I was feeling went away for like a minute then right back. The second time I was trying to recreate this and suddenly got it just right and felt the skin of my lower back relax and it traveled up my spine and everything slipped back again. It felt like my entire left side suddenly took a big breath. I could breathe clearly, smell better, the dysfunctions all went away and I felt the muscles in the occipital area tighten up and suddenly I could see clearly and consistently again. After about 5 minutes it all went back to symptomatic.\n* Holding a wedge between my inner thighs that is more tube in shape while I stand helps\n* When sitting if I wedge under my left thigh closer to the upper middle part there are a lot of tight bands and it releases some of the tension and I swear when it's just right clears up my vision as well.\n\n# Lifestyle:\n\nI now sit a lot during the day. For the past 2+ years I have worked office jobs and have been a student full-time since the issue started. From 2014-2018 I worked out lifting weights 4-6 times a week which is where I had noticed the onset of issues after about a year without any. I stopped working out entirely this past winter after symptoms became too much and my left abs no longer felt stable enough for me to work out without fear of injury. I don't have a car and walk pretty much everywhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# MRIs/Findings:\n\nXrays (probably shitty, were done at a chiropracter a few weeks ago.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/z15s5gz8asd31.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/wzjqafz8asd31.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ppfu6fz8asd31.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/bhbhpfz8asd31.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/cxzfykz8asd31.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zuyn1gz8asd31.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ihanmhz8asd31.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/haprbfz8asd31.png\n\n* Cervical MRI\n\nImpression: Study limited by mild motion artifact. Grossly there is minimal annular bulge at C5-C6 without evidence of disc protrusion or spinal stenosis.\n\nNarrative\n\nClinical history: Neck pain.Noncontrast multiplanar MRI imaging of the lumbar spine was performed. Examination is limited due to mild motion artifact on the axial T1-weighted and T2-weighted images. Grossly no evidence of extrinsic compression of the cervical spinal cord and no evidence of T2-weighted signal normality within the cord is seen. There is straightening of the normal cervical lordosis which may be positional in nature or related to muscle spasm. Minimal annular bulge is present at C5-C6. No evidence of disc protrusion or spinal stenosis is seen. On the axial images there is moderate symmetric prominence of the palatine tonsillar soft tissues with mild-to-moderate narrowing of the adjacent airway.\n\n* Lumbar Spine MRI\n\nIMPRESSION: No evidence of focal disc herniation, central stenosis, or neural foraminal narrowing in the lumbar spine.\n\n## Narrative\n\nCLINICAL HISTORY: Back painTECHNIQUE:Noncontrast lumbar spine MRICOMPARISON: Radiographs lumbar spine 12/17/18FINDINGS: Straightening of the lumbar curvature loss of normal lordosis.

I'll take any suggestions on what to tell them when I'm there.\n* Hip arthrogram came back clean, no labral tear\n\n# Doctors:\n\nMost doctors didn't do much of anything besides simple reflex tests to check anything. The general doctor that has known me the longest as well as the physical therapist office I currently go to have been the only ones to really use their hands and palpate around or even take more than 5 minutes to check me out. Subsequently they have had the most findings. But since this started I have seen a myriad of doctors where I mostly confused them because I sound all over the place and feels things everywhere. Over time it has helped to narrow things down and the pelvis thesis which we've only started following in the past couple months.\n\n* 4 chiropractors\n* 2 Orthopedic Surgeons\n* Cervical Surgeon\n* Neurologist\n* Neuromuscular\n* 5 Physical Therapists (4 same place)\n* Jaw Surgeon\n* General Surgeon\n* Talk Therapist\n\n# Medical History:\n\n* Right Inguinal Hernia Repair - No Mesh (2008)\n* Left Inguinal Hernia Repair - No Mesh (2009) Same surgeon as 2008 repair and possibly the start of my issues. This one I badly hurt myself post-op the next morning. I felt so good after this one that I was walking around and feeling 100% almost right after the surgery. So good that the next morning I had completely forgotten in my usual morning haze and extended my left leg with a hard morning stretch because I felt I needed to. Needless to say this was a horrible idea and to this day was the most horrible pain I've felt. It was a sharp stabbing pain with a burning stretching feeling that felt like I was being electrocuted down my leg all at the same time. After a few minutes I caught my breath and checked under the bandage expecting a bloodbath and it looked fine. But ever since then my inner thigh up where it meets the pelvis and general hernia repair surgery has been numb. Like can't feel an icepack numb. Later when doing mixed martial arts (2011-2014 with no issue like what I feel now) I would sometimes get a reminder of a feeling when I stretched my left leg too far to the outside.A few weeks ago a pelvic physical therapist was doing dry needling of the pectineus and surrounding erectors when she reproduced the burning electrical feeling which I felt before. I felt it in my inguinal area/inner thigh, right above my knee, and above my foot where it bends. Afterwards it provided a bit of relief and released some of the tension in my chest letting me breathe a bit better and was a bit more comfortable to walk after some of the tension released in my legs.\n* Other than my surgeries my medical record is pretty much spotless outside of 5 years of braces. Never had any type of issue with anything and enjoyed full use of everything outside of the hernias.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this is a lot but this bothers me every second and I've seen a lot of doctors. Having seen full relief twice it gives me hopes and let's me at least know it's not in my head. Posting here is a long shot but I'm looking for any and all direction/ideas. Anything anyone can add would be greatly appreciated and I'm happy to answer any questions.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Tests keep coming back normal.", "author": "arosemind", "self_text": "**Age:** 24 **Sex:** F **Height:** 5'5 **Weight:** 135 **Race:** White **Duration of complaint:** Since late April 2019 **Geographic location:** Florida **Body location:** Left leg **Medical issues:** Urinary issues (working on it with a urologist), previous diagnosis of Fibromyalgia **Medication:** Oxybutynin 10 mg **Smoking:** No **Work:** Desk job **Activity level**: Mostly sedentary due to pain, but I take walks and practice yoga when I can\n\nHiya. I've been having some intense, ongoing pain and discomfort in my left leg since late April. I am seeing doctors for this (as my story will indicate) but I'm hoping that someone here might be able to give me an idea of what to look out for.\n\nTLDR is at the bottom but I would appreciate it if you could read the whole thing. Photos are at the bottom as well.\n\nI started feeling sharp, shocking pains in my left leg's calf every 30 minutes to an hour. I haven't felt anything like it before in my life. The pain is so intense I could cry. It comes randomly and nothing triggers it but it is consistent, although it doesn't happen as frequently as it did in April/May.\n\nThen I started feeling weakness, tightness and heaviness in the same leg and noticed swelling (it is most noticeable in the back of my knee, and small veins are more visible there as well - you can see this in the photos below) and thickness all over. It aches and it is very sensitive. When it's touched, it feels like whatever's touching it could push right through my leg. I sometimes feel a sensation like something is trying to come out of my leg, like pressing or pushing. My left leg is redder than my right leg and it looks like the skin is more translucent as well. I also sometimes feel a pain in the back of my knee where it bends. As I mentioned before, I see that a vein is more pronounced and this is around the area where the pain is.\n\nMore recently, I've noticed that parts of my leg will feel like there's water on it but it always ends up being completely dry. My left foot is similarly sensitive and I often feel a random tingly feeling. I sometimes see pitting in my leg/foot when I accidentally put too much pressure on it. Moving my leg/foot doesn't help and keeping it still doesn't help. I can't walk or sit comfortably and I only feel a tiny bit of relief when I am laying down. All of these symptoms with the exception of the sharp, shocking pain (which is limited to my calf and less frequent than it used to be) and the vein pain (which is infrequent but enough to be a concern) are felt all the time and all over my leg.\n\nI didn't realize it until later, but a couple of weeks prior to this pain starting, I felt weakness in my legs and feet and had trouble standing up from the couch after sitting there for short periods of time. I almost fell down a couple of times. I believe it went away shortly after a week or so but I remember being concerned about it. I'm not experiencing it currently.\n\nI should add that I was in a car accident a few years ago and I had leg and knee pain in the same knee as well as a hematoma in my left side (where I now have consistent sharp pains as well - mostly when I sleep on it or move the wrong way, though not as often anymore). I had MRIs that came back normal and physical therapy for a few months but nothing that the orthopedic doctor at the time could diagnose. I don't think that this is related since I didn't have any calf pain or pain of this kind at the time at all but I figured it's worth mentioning here.\n\nI went to the ER the day after I first started feeling the sharp pain to check if it was DVT. I had a venous ultrasound, an x-ray and a blood test that all came back negative for DVT or any kind of insufficiency. I went to my PCP a week later and she suggested going to an orthopedic doctor and a neurologist. While I waited for my appointments to come up, I had an MRI of my left knee, my lumbar spine and my calf - all negative. Then I had an arterial ultrasound on my leg and an echocardiogram to see if it was related to my heart - also all fine according to the radiologist. However, the woman performing the ultrasound on my leg quickly did another venous ultrasound on certain areas of my leg because DVT can show up later on (it apparently didn't this time), and she mentioned to me that she could see a dilated vein and that it could be related to varicose veins. I brought this up to my PCP and she is in the process of referring me to a vascular surgeon.\n\nI finally went to the orthopedic doctor and he said that since everything came back normal, it didn't seem like I have anything \"structurally wrong with me\". He mentioned that one of his previous patients complained of similar symptoms and everything came back normal but that they later found out it was multiple sclerosis. He suggested that I work on my symptoms more with the neurologist.\n\nI went to the neurologist and after discussing possible things it could be like compartment syndrome or a baker\u2019s cyst, he said that he'd do an EMG nerve test. Fast forward a few weeks and I have the test. WOW, that was not fun. The majority of it was just uncomfortable but when he did the test on my calf where my shocking pain and pushing sensations are, I felt like my leg was going to explode - it really amplified the pushing sensation. The marks from the needles are still very visible in my skin, maybe related to the pitting I mentioned previously? Once the test was over, the neurologist said that it all came back normal and I don't have any nerve damage, which is what the test was evaluating. I told him what the orthopedic doctor said about multiple sclerosis and he said that while he isn't a multiple sclerosis specialist, he doesn't feel that it's necessary to have me get a brain scan (which I had for headaches three years ago and it was clean). He said to move forward with the orthopedic doctor (despite the orthopedic doctor saying the opposite and basically discharging me during my last visit) and the vascular surgeon. He also suggested seeing a rheumatologist, which I'm getting a referral for from my PCP and waiting on now.\n\nI know that this is a lot and I really appreciate it if you've gotten this far in my post. If anyone has had similar symptoms or has any advice or suggestions for me, please let me know!\n\n**TLDR:** Constant pain in my left leg (sharp/shocking pain in calf, weakness, aching, tightness, heaviness all over leg, possible dilated vein).

Last friday, one week ago, I took a 4 hour nap, woke up extremely hot and probably dehydrated and got up to go to the bathroom. I almost always get lightheaded and blurry vision when getting up at any time but it will go away after about 10 or 15 seconds. However this time I felt exceptionally heavy and dizzy so I leaned on my shower for support. I woke up and was sitting on the ground next to my shower, my whole body aching, enough to evoke an audible noise from myself ( note I have never fainted before). I went upstairs to tell my mom and she told me she heard a loud noise, my fall. We assumed it was because of common symptoms like dehydration and heat, but I have noticed more peculiar things happening to me...\n\nA few days later I was shaving my legs in the shower, sort of tilting my head down and my lips began to go numb. It was a very strange feeling I had never experienced and I even got out of the shower to make sure I hadn\u2019t cut myself somehow. I was thinking maybe it was because I was reducing blood flow to my head by bending over... But, I do that normally and never experience this. \n\nYesterday, I was laying out in the sun for about 30 mins, obviously pretty hot, and when I got up I began to experience my normal blurry vision which I payed no mind to, except for when my vision started to get somewhat dark.

I went to doctors, neurologist, kinesi therapist and chiropractors to help battle this problem. I tried basically everything except surgery ( and it was never suggested by any of those professionals ) . Diagnosis went from nerve damage to spine damage to brain damage to diet issues and non of the treatment worked. For treatment I tried pills, therapy, stretching , exercising, dieting, chiropractor adjustments and combinations of all of those things. Again I point out none of it worked. About an year and a half ago I discovered a clip for anxiety relief. It was a yoga practice for alternate nostril breathing. You breath from one nostril and exhale from the other then switch and you do this for about 5 minutes. Breathing only through my right nostril I noticed something. My inflammatory sensation decreased right away and it felt amazing but it returned like 1-2 hours after. I had a septum deviation in said nostril and I though maybe my blood circulation in the right side of the body was just bad and that's why I had all those problems. Problem was that circulation as I discovered didn't work like that and it didn't matter if the air was coming from one or the other nostril. Yet I saw some studies that with right nostril breathing you inhale more oxygen. Still it was the only thing that was working so I decided to make the deviation fix surgery. It went ok - it didn't completely fix it but it was definitely better. And as I suspected the inflammatory problems decreased... for about 4 months. It all returned after. Somehow my deviation started to return too and I was noticing decreased oxygen again. About 2 months ago I started informing myself again and started doing the right nostril breathing again, but hey I can't do it all day and then I saw the nostril cycle clip again and though what if my sleeping position was the problem. I never though of it before but I always sleep with my right side of the face downward to the pillow. So when you sleep like this the nostril cycle disrupts and is always focused on the opposite nostril. So if you sleep on your right side the left nostril is the one that is functional. That's all night every day FOR YEARS. So the fix was simply train yourself to sleep on the left side. First week was very hard and I clocked in bout 2-3 hours of deep sleep per night ( have a fitness band that measured this ) .I know that when you sleep your body changes position at least 10 times a night but in my case they were almost all on my right side laying on the pillow. I recorded myself with a phone 2 times to check if my position switched . That was the 2 days before me trying to sleep on the left side. But now 2 months later my deviation started to decrease on its own (ether that or just somehow my oxygen intake increased through my right nostril) . Inflammation is almost gone and exercising and stretching is now actually working. I still don't know why a nostril can cause all this but it's what fixed me. It worked but I don't know why since according to the studies it shouldn't matter all that much which side you sleep on or which nostril you breath from. Any thoughts?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I recall that I was thinking about spitting on the floor(for some reason) when a man snored loudly. I felt an odd, very painfull sensation in my head. At the same time, I proceeded to spit on the floor, without the intention of doing so. It very much felt like my body was doing it by himself. I recall the sensation of electricity flowing through my body, but I am unsure of this memory for some reason. Later, when I was studying, the same thing happened, but less intense pain, some loud sound, then a painful sensation while my fingers scrolled down the pdf I was reading. I had no intention to do so, I was reading a paragraph and had no need to scroll down.\n\nThe involuntary movements/behavior did not happen again, however, the sensations still remain. They are triggered by certain sounds, usually coughing, sneezing and snoring. Other sounds that have the same quality can also trigger these sensations.\n\nThe more I put stress on my mind(studying, thinking about a hard subject, etc), the more sensitive I become to these sounds. As I put strain on my mind, they first just start to bother me a little, then I start having irrational emotional reactions and then it culminates in pain. Sometimes the pain is enough to stun me, I stay put, unresponsive, looking in front of me at nothing.\n\nI've been avoiding experiencing them by staying in my room, rarely leaving the house and rarely studying. Tried to find a way to avoid the sounds by using earplugs and headphones with a loud white noise, got tinnitus because of it. When I can predict that the sound is going to happen, I can block it by flexing those muscles inside my ears that make a rumbling noise. This is effective, but I rarely get the opportunity to take advantage of this strategy.\n\nThe doctor tells me to speak with the psychiatrist about it, but my psychiatrist tells me to speak with the doctor. Neither gave me the opportunity to fully explain the situation. I would like to have a general idea of what this could be, and which kind of specialist I should consult.

I finished the full 5 days. \n\nThree days after that however, the symptoms came back. I woke up with burning when peeing,  blood and flakes in pee. I wouldn\u2019t be able to see a doctor for a few days so I decided to wait it out. Starting that day I drank a ton of water and went to the bathroom as much as possible and as the day progressed my symptoms would slowly get better. Then I would wake up and would get the same symptoms and would do it again - drink a ton of water and symptoms would faze out. This lasted three days. On the forth day (today) I woke up and it seemed as though my symptoms were no longer there - the only thing I kind of felt was a slight full feeling in the bladder. This was also the day I went to see my doctor. I explained my symptoms and he prescribed the same antibiotics but for 7 days instead of 5. \n\nHere is my question: I have read a ton online that said UTIs can sometimes clear on their own . Could it be possible that this happened? My symptoms defiantly came back after that 5 day antibiotics treatment but I\u2019m thinking me drinking all that water when it happened may have just diluted the pee making me not feel any discomfort? I\u2019m scared that taking another round of antibiotics will cause more harm than good. But then again even if it\u2019s just a small bit of bacteria left it would be better to kill it off?\nI\u2019m staying away from sexual intercourse for at least a month to be extra safe.\n\nTl;dr:\nhad a UTI \u2014&gt; it cleared up after 5 days of antibiotics\u2014&gt; it came back after 3 days \u2014&gt; I drank a ton of water and seemed to have flushed it out in 3 days w/o antibiotics\u2014&gt; Saw a doctor again now I\u2019m on 7 days of antibiotics \nScared this will cause more hard then good ie Bacteria will become more resistant in the future", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

She smoked and I had a 50 mg THC gummy edible. 50mg isn\u2019t crazy for me; I usually stick around 25mg, but I\u2019ve done 50 before and never had issues. \n\nWe were watching Tuca and Birdie (rip) which is a very colorful show with a lot going on. The images started to seem too bright and my head hurt. Felt like my head was being squeezed. I also heard ringing in my skull.\n\nI got up to go to the bathroom, but when I sat on the toilet I couldn\u2019t breathe through my nose anymore. It felt too dry. The room was spinning and the ringing became one single tone. I couldn\u2019t hear anything else. My vision went from normal to blue/red and pixelated-ish. Then gone altogether. I was nauseous and confused, but as sound and vision went away, I just felt calm. \n\nMy partner heard me mumbling and came to check on me. She said my eyes fluttered/rolled back, then I slumped off the toilet. I was sitting bare-assed in vomit. I wasn\u2019t conscious for this, but she said my mouth was locked shut. Like I refused to open it. She pried my mouth open, reached down my throat and clawed the vomit out. I think I wasn\u2019t breathing bc my airway was blocked. \n\nI remember feeling like I was dying and being okay with it, but then I saw her and wanted to stay. So my partner saved my life, undoubtedly.\n\nTL;DR: Passed out on the john, puked in my throat and couldn\u2019t breathe. \n\nMy question is, why did any of this happen?

I'm experiencing a real annoying problem for about 6 months now. It started with a red area around my anus and it was also itching a lot. I went to the doctor with it and he prescribed me an anti-fungal cream: it helped and the symptoms were gone. \n\nThe other things I started to notice were that my penis was very dry and also had a really bad smell coming off of it. On top of that, I had a bad smell coming from my breath and it almost had the same smell as from my penis. I didn't think the smell in my mouth would be that important so I only went to the doctor for my penis at that moment. He prescribed a number of anti-fungal creams and also Vaseline. The moments that the anti-fungal creams were applied, the problem seemed to be solved, but if I stopped for one day it would be back immediately. Then I started with apple cider vinegar: drinking 2 tablespoons mixed with water twice a day for two weeks and pouring apple cider vinegar over my penis twice a day for a week. After this the problems were completely gone, in the meantime I use Vaseline about twice a week. Incidentally, the stink breath also went away because of the apple vinegar.  \n\nNow 3 weeks after having stopped drinking apple cider vinegar, some of the symptoms are back. My stink breath and the stench of my penis are what it was again, on top of that I'm getting the itch back around my anus (mostly the are between my buttcheeks). The drought has not returned: this may be related to the fact that I apply Vaseline twice a week. I also went to the dermatologist, who indicated that it was about eczema, but that appears not to be the case since the apple cider vinegar stopped the symptoms from both my breath and my penis.  Could it be that I have a fungus that is hidden deep in my body? That apple cider vinegar prevented it but is not enough to wipe it out completely?

I just came back home from college and I was doing alright. My food intake was normal and my diet(while not the healthiest) was normal as well. Around June I started experiencing abdominal pain that was in the lower right side. This became a constant pain that worsened when I ate food. I have also been experiencing diarrhea no matter what food I ate. At first doctors were worried that I had appendicitis. \n\nThey checked my appendix with an ultrasound and it was all good. They then gave me some NSAID IV med that helped a little bit but I sorta lied to the doc at the ER that I was doing better because I was not missing my sister\u2019s and my Dad\u2019s graduation. \n\nThen rolled around July and this pain and diarrhea hasn\u2019t let up and Tylenol isn\u2019t touching it. So by that point my pain out of 1-10 was nearing a 9. \n\nI haven\u2019t explained the pain yet. It\u2019s basically constant cramping. \n\nSo then I visit my GI doctor to explain what\u2019s been going on. She then gives me a Hemoccult blood test just to see if there was any blood in my stool. That test came back positive which triggered my doc to order an Endoscopy and Colonoscopy.\n\nOf course I was under anesthesia so I remember hardly anything but my mom said that they visually saw that the ileum of my small intestine was visually inflamed and that the doctor who did the scope was concerned with me maybe having IBD, likely Crohn\u2019s Disease. In fact they perfectly understood why I haven\u2019t been eating like my usually and they didn\u2019t make me eat a small snack afterward unlike the other patients.\n\nBy this point my diet was Gatorade and Water.\n\nWeirdly and Surprisingly the biopsies came back normal. \n\nBut I was still experiencing this pain. So we go back to the ER and they admit me, this time inserting a feeding tube because throughout all of this I have lost 20 pounds. The formula they give me has no other ingredients besides straight nutrients and I was still dealing with diarrhea and this cramping pain. \n\nThey then test something called fecal calprotectin which is a marker for IBD. The normal range for that is 0-50, the borderline is 50-120, and abnormal is &amp;gt;120.\n\nI was 116 and so they said it wasn\u2019t as high as they expected. \n\nSo after 5 days of being fed from the tube, they said they have run every test and came up with the conclusion that I have IBS-D. \n\nHere\u2019s where I have a question, does this this seem consistent with a diagnosis of IBS or does it seem to be something else?\n\nThey gave me Levsin and Imodium to help but that hasn\u2019t solved my pain.\n\nIt has been emotionally very hard because right now literally everything I eat is painful. \n\nTL:DR Went the the hospital multiple times because of abdominal pain, diarrhea and 20 pounds weight loss in a month. Eating worsens the cramping pain. \nIs constant cramping a symptom of IBS?\n\nHere\u2019s the stool tests they have done:\n\n- a stool culture for any bacterial/viral : negative\n- a ova and parasite test : negative\n- C diff : negative\n- fecal calprotectin: 116, called it borderline\n\nNo Salmonella, no E.coli none of those\n\nGenerally I\u2019m a healthy guy but my immune system has always been shot. It takes quite a bit of work to keep my immune system under control.

I've never considered myself to have any mental illness, the only things I've dealt with are anxiety, depression, and insomnia, but I always attributed that to being a normal life struggle. \n\nThe past 6 months have been really hard on me. Throughout my daily life, I often feel drained of energy despite getting good sleep. It's hard for me to start or even want to start tasks that I know require a lot of time and effort. Leisure activities don't seem to interest me anymore. It's like there's someone constantly shooting down every idea I have with a subtle \"this activity will get boring.\" My last semester was horrible. I couldn't turn anything in on time, I couldn't focus or retain much information. My grades have been subtly declining from straight A's to now D's and C's. I started noticing this around the age of 12, which was the last year I remember being able to read a book for an English assignment. Since then every time I've picked up a book I can't get past the first couple pages without rereading every word a million times.\n\nI've always been a very compulsively organized person. I like making lists and keeping my room tidy, however that has become a problem for me now. Lists scare me because I feel I could never write down EVERYTHING I need to do. If my room isn't tidy it also stresses me out way more than it probably should. My thoughts feel random and erratic, I go through mood swings of feeling depressed and unmotivated to feeling happy and on top of the world. It's like my emotions are something I can no longer find reason with.  Because of this, I've experienced intense anxiety; sometimes I would lay down to fall asleep and it would feel like every muscle in my body has contracted over me. Chest pain, throat pain, all the common symptoms of anxiety. I've become more secluded throughout this, seeing my family and friends less and less. School will be starting next month and I'm worried I won't be able to do anything better than C's and D's. Coffee has become my bandaid, to cope with the lack of energy and will to do anything. I've read into ADHD and ADD, Anemia, etc, all of these I feel could be options but my parents don't want me getting tested for ADHD/ADD.

Jello?...more like they disappeared?.... At the same time I felt like I was falling over to that side, but I wasn't really falling...I don't think.

My knee didn't buckle, but it kind of felt like my leg wasn't there, same with my arm, although they seemed to be following instructions. I lifted my foot up and put it back down, turned around.

I could tell it to do things and it would do them but weirdly disconnected.

Everything else below.\n\nI have been constantly doing sports for the last 13 years. My sport - climbing - is the love of my life and very important to me. I have been making good progress for the first maybe 5 years of climbing, and the last like 8 years I have been making pretty much zero progress. I have tried everything I could and finally came to the conclusion that the main thing that stops me is my permanent muscle tenseness. Yes, it's weird that it took me so long to figure it out, but I'm always first blaming myself for doing something wrong and only then searching for other factors.\n\nBasically, most of my muscles are tense 100% of the time. It's easy to tell by touching them, they are hard to the touch (some more, some less). I couldn't tell before since I kinda never compared this to other people. I get up every day and feel like I've been run over by a car or like I've exercised the day before for the first time in 10 years, even if I did absolutely zero sport. Every single day. During the day I will always feel the muscles to be tired, like after a really thorough workout after a big break, but I workout 4-5 times per week and do the same things all the time. I thought I should just work out less, but no, no change there.\n\nAny sort of massage is very painful and changes nothing. I have those foam rollers (\"black roll\") - just putting, say, my calf on a roller without putting any pressure is really painful. Any sort of relaxation techniques - progressive muscle relaxation, just going to a sauna - don't help in the slightest. I don't control any part of this.\n\nI have recently found a doctor who seemed to be very knowledgeable about all this, he has a lot of experience with climbers specifically on a world level (national team athletes). So I had a full X-ray of my spine and a very specific blood test.\n\nTurns out my spine is all zig-zag-like, I have then received specific exercises from the doctor to activate the muscles that were not working in my case. I can see the progress with the exercises but no changes with my condition.\n\nI am also lacking a lot of microelements in my blood like kalium that are supposed to help muscles relax. I have received a detailed plan from my doctor what vitamins and supplements I should take to balance it all out, that was supposed to help, but after 3.5 months of this I am still not noticing any difference.\n\nI have recently had a lot of pain in the right side of my back due to even more muscle blocks, so another doctor prescribed me medicine (Ortoton) for muscle relaxation, did not help at all (consumed the whole package in prescribed doses). Another similar medicine was prescribed (Sirdalud), a small dose does nothing to me, a big one just makes me extremely tired, no muscle relaxation at all.\n\nJust as a side note, I also look very muscular (I've never consumed any supplements for that), I think it comes from my dad whose legs look muscular even though he has a pretty sedentary lifestyle with occasional travels. I also don't think I can list any other medical issues I have that are related to this, only maybe also this fact: I am a person who easily stresses over everything, so I can call myself permanently stressed, but it's psychological, and I'm working on it.\n\nSo, I'm at my wit's end, and so is my doctor. I am 99% sure that if I don't solve this, I will never have more progress in climbing, since the muscles just can't get stronger anymore because they don't rest. Climbing is really the thing that makes me most happy, and progress is extremely important to me. Also, it makes my life hard since it's painful every day.\n\nAny ideas here would be very appreciated. Thanks a lot in advance.

I've hit a wall talking with my Neuro MDS and have also gotten second opinions. There are just some details that bother me that have not been addressed well and I'm looking for some feedback. I'm a healthcare professional, so I do think I have valid concerns and questions.\n\nTo get to the core quickly, I'll lay out the basics/obvious. I have a resting right sided tremor, it is a stereotypical \"pill rolling\" (wrist flexion/extension and 1st knuckle flexion/extension). It can be pretty strong at times. I also have some bradykinesia, so my gross/fine motor skills are affected, both with my right upper and lower extremities. I've also had a positive DAT scan, and a negative MRI (IIRC with and without contrast). So, pretty straightforward it seems.\n\nThe sticking points: (trying to keep these brief, sorry!)\n\nWhen I had my DAT scan, I was not told to DC my bupropion, which is shown to affect the test and can cause \n\nfalse-positives. There  has been some debate amung my neurologists regarding validity of the test.\n\nMy MRI was taken very early after my symptoms onset. Not sure how much that changes.\n\nI've experienced fasiculations essentially all over my body. Not a tremor, a true fasiculation. They do not often repeat, and are bilateral and central.\n\nWhen I started taking azilect, I tolerated it well at first. However I started to develop severe arthralgia. As in, so bad I could only stand for \\~15 minutes, and sleep was extremely difficult. This prompted me to see a rheumatologist, where they found significant inflamatory markers and a + HLAB27 marker, but physically they did not find any changes to support a formal ankylosing spondlitis diagnosis. However, MRIs did show some Right sided C6-7 stenosis. The orthopedist I saw asked if I had ever been in a car accident due to the cervical spine damage (I have not), but he still maintained that none of my symptoms were related since the EMG was negative.\n\nI've had significant pain in my right arm, as well as some muscle wasting in my hand, and strength deficits. It took 3 EMGs to finally detect a fairly significant slowing at my cubital tunnel (37 mS as opposed to the speculated 50 ms for my demographics). The last test administrator basicly said the last 2 people did a crap job. I had surgery on the nerve, and my pain is much better in my right arm, but the wasting is still there.\n\nI've been on amantadine and 4mg ropinirole for, well, years now. Sometimes I miss doses, and it's not clear if my symptoms are worse or not. Unfortunately since I work full time, I'm not receptive to going cold turkey and seeing what happens. I will say though that when I was taking a \"diagnostic doseing\" years ago of Carbadopa/levidopa, I do not feel that there was a difference in any symptoms. My neurologist was nonplussed. Later after I got a new neurologist/MDS, I collected data for fine motor skills (typing tests) by doing a test 2x a day for one minute for \\~ 10 days, and adjusted my ropinirole by 2mg each testing period. The data was not significant from 0 mg to 6mg or even from night to day. That neurologist did not take this data\n\nOn top of that, I strongly feel that I have right sided weakness. Unfortunately most manual muscle testing is pretty basic and relies heavily on experience/technique, so unless it's obviously pathological, you get a 'perfect' score. I do not believe this is a 'freezing'/initiation issue, but this is hard to prove. Every time I go to the gym though, I primarily have right sided delayed onset muscle soreness, and that side often fatigues faster with activities. I also have some mild scapular offset (which occurs with focal weakness). Also, working out typically wrecks me for a good 24+ hours. My syptoms are not worse during or an hour or three after, it's much longer. When I work out on a regular basis my symptoms stay bad prettymuch the whole time.\n\nI've also had predominately unilateral eye irritation/weeping, usually brought on by light or exercise. My opthamologist has no clue.\n\nI also have sensory sensitivity. I hate the heat, it typically makes my symptoms worse. I also have/had vibration sensitivity. It got so bad that I had to get a stelite ganglion block (which helped a lot!). I couldn't use a drill or leaf blower without worsening symptoms and severe arm pain (this was long after my arm surgery).\n\nThe latest issue is my medication. Recently, I started having some focal R knee joint pain. I take 1k MG of a drug called sulfasalazine 2x/day for the 'undifferentiated inflamatory disease'/ankylosing spondylitis. So, I upped my dosage to 1.5k 2x/day. After about 4-5 days, my symptoms improved (tremor, weakness, fine motor skills). I backed off to 1k, they got worse again. My rheumatologist does not believe me.\n\nSo, I'm starting to think this is MS. I could really use some advice as to how I should keep collecting information/talk to my neurologist at my next visit,", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

The sweat itself isn't the problem, but the whole feeling of being \"hot\" and needing colder temperatures. I've always been like this, but I've been noticing it getting worse these last few years.\n\nI can only feel truly comfortable if the temperature is around ~77 \u00baF / 25 \u00baC or lower. Other than that, I start feeling hot. It's specially noticeable when I'm with other people, since I'm the only one feeling hot and needing a fan or an air conditioner nearby. And don't get me started when I'm eating and I start digesting; I turn into a human oven.\n\nI haven't even worn a coat or jacket in winter for years; sometimes it reaches 23 \u00baF / -5 \u00baC in my area and I'm still warm enough with just a hoodie and a T-shirt, and even with that I sometimes sweat and feel hot. I really love winter because of this, since I can really enjoy being outside without feeling hot all the time.\n\nAs most people do, I've looked up online and they usually relate heat sensitivity with **diabetes** and/or **hyperthyroidism**. The thing is don't have diabetes neither I have hyperthyroidism. In fact, I have **subclinical hypothyroidism** (which is under control with no medication, I do regular tests and I'm always on normal levels). They usually relate hypothyroidism with cold sensitivity, which is clearly not the case.\n\nI also attributed this to my weight initially, but I've always felt the same even when I weighted 20 kgs less.\n\nThis is really upsetting because I feel uncomfortable in places where other people are fine. I dislike wearing shirts and suits because I get really heated and I get anxious, since I can't take anything off and the feeling of being hot is really uncomfortable. Even only wearing a shirt is too hot for me in most cases; taking the underground for work or even moving is a guarantee of feeling heated and sweating.\n\nPeople usually joke about me having \"northern genes\", which is partially true: I have very pale skin and clear blue eyes. I get burned easily with little exposure and I tend to get blinded easily by sunlight; I don't mean by looking directly at it, but as soon as it reflects on a white surface like a wall or in a clear pavement I need to close my eyes. I know some part of my ancestry comes from northern Europe and they also share these traits.\n\n\nIs there any way to modify this? Can I \"train\" my body or do anything to change this? Are there any other medical issues or diseases that might be causing this and I'm ignoring?\n\n\nThanks in advance.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

For some context about myself, I am a 16 year old male (5'9, 155lbs) that previously suffered from migraines, but I no longer have these happen to me since I started a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting 3 months ago. I attribute these migraines to my previous eating habits, which involved a lot of gluten and refined sugars. Migraines were just one of the side effects though, as other symptoms I chronically suffered from included acid reflux, heart burn, irritable bowel syndrome, lethargy, and depression.\n\nYesterday, after going all-out on the leg press machine I suffered from what I can only describe as severe tension throughout the top of my skull and behind my eyelids. I felt as if something was crushing my head inwards, yet I couldn't stop it regardless of what I did. After researching a bit about my situation, I quickly realized it was most likely an exertion headache (these typically last during the workout and don't linger around for long). In my situation, the headache has been ongoing for over 14 hours (became less painful after the first hour but has remained at a fairly noticeable and annoying intensity), and I have no idea why this is the case. I don't know if this is a cause for concern, but I can definitely rule out things like hydration and nutrition.\n\nShould I be worried about having an underlying condition, such as a brain tumor/hemorraghe? Is it worth it to perform a brain scan at this point? Thank you in advice.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

For instance, what began as a generic fear of a break-in has now escalated to a crippling obsession with the idea that there would be an intruder in my home. It's not uncommon for me to stay up two or three days in a row because this fear doesn't allow me to sleep.\n\nSimilarly, another fixation I have is the thought of getting into a car wreck (I don't have a license, so this fear is as a passenger, but it's universal; it doesn't matter who the driver of the car is). At times, it gets so bad I feel the need to have my phone camera open and ready to record to have evidence that the hypothetical Other Driver is at fault.\n\nIn both these scenarios, the thought of death or injury is not what frightens me. In fact, I'm rather apathetic in regards to that notion. There is no real reason I'm afraid of these events other than the fact that they are Bad Things That Could Happen.\n\nI have other, more mild fixations such as cleanliness. For example, the other day I was scrubbing the kitchen counter, and after I was finished, my sister put a dirty potted plant down on the counter (with a paper towel as a coaster), and this caused me to have a panic attack that resulted in me being almost nonverbal for about half an hour.\n\nAnother mild fixation is general sensory processing. My clothes need to feel symmetrical on both sides of my body. If something brushes against one hand, it needs to brush against the same place on the other hand. Any sort of sensory asymmetry upsets me greatly. If my hair won't sit right, or refuses to cooperate, I just snip it off. \n\nThese obsessions are obviously affecting my everyday life and my ability to be happy. I can never relax or feel satisfied because there's this ominous, looming inevitability of a disaster or a Bad Thing. For years, I've written these things off as universal experiences, that everyone does these things and feels this way. But I'm starting to kind of doubt that.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Is he at risk?\n\nSome more background: this was part of a whole roast pig purchased for a wedding a week ago. I was simply eating leftovers today. No guests in the wedding have reported symptoms so far.\n\nI have called poison control and they said I likely did consume some larvae but they also said nothing I can do about it.

Yesterday and today I looked at my mouth and saw that the area next to my lips was a little red but I was concerned because I also saw two tiny little whitish yellow bumps. I picked at them so unfortunately I dont have a picture of it but I couldnt tell if it was a cold sore or just bumps from the cuts healing. Does this area next to my lips look like a cold sore for you? Dont mind the lips because I know for a fact I cut my lips with the razor which is why it looks red there. Im just concerned about the red area on my cheek.  It's probably just razor bumps right? Thanks.\n\nAlso for reference I went that part specifically again the day after I shaved to get a better look at it so that might be why it looks so red compared to everything else(cause its fresher). \n\nPic: [https://imgur.com/a/FUeiFXy](https://imgur.com/a/FUeiFXy)", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I have acid reflux that I've never taken any kind of medication or supplement for\n\nI've been losing hair since Fall - Early Winter of 2018, it started as thinning around the temples of my hair, it looked like a normal receding hairline that I didn't care too much about. My entire scalp was sore and it'd hurt to pull **any** hair on my scalp. My hair was falling out all over and I'd often wake up to a pillow covered in hair or a hairy bathtub after showering. An excess amount of hair would come out of my hair no matter where I combed from. All of my hair was shedding but all of my hair kept growing like normal except areas at the side/top of my head that just stopped growing entirely has since to grow with the rest of my hair. Over time though, my scalp stopped being sore and my hair stopped shedding.\n\n**my medical issue**\n\nI didn't think anything of it but now my scalp problems are hard to ignore. My scalp is in constant pain ! It feels like I'm constantly being bit by fire ants. It burns for hours and will leave a bald spot when I look at it a few hours later. I'll have a bald spot exactly where I felt burning as if the burning itself is what caused my hair to fall out. It only effected my hairline at first, leaving coin sized spots that would overlap and then eventually a big chunk of hair would be gone. Eventually I started to have areas on the \\[side, top - mostly\\], as well as the back that would burn and leave circular bald spots. When there's a new area, it'll present itself with a very intense itch, it's hard to ignore. After a few weeks, sometimes days, that spot'll start burning and leave no hair behind it. It's most only effected hair at the sides of my head and around the temple, they overlap and the burn is more severe in these areas. There's since been many other areas with burning circles which have yet to overlap.\n\nI spent hours trying to research why this was happening to me. My hair still falls out even when I don't scratch or itch it. Oils and Conditioners only seem to make it burn more. I'm not depressed and I'm not stressed. I can't massage my hair in these areas because it hurts, it hurts to pull or play with and is sensitive to touch usually; especially during episodes of hair loss . The spots that fall out and have no more hair remaining don't burn or itch after all hair is gone but when I put oils, conditioner, or growth serum on it, especially around my forehead - I can feel it begin to burn the spots where my hair once was.\n\nThis is progressively getting worse and worse, it happened every week or so at first until it started happening every other day. Now it happens every day. I didn't think it was natural because I've never heard of anyone with pattern baldness feeling pain or having bald spots all around their scalp. Not only is my hairline too uneven too be M shaped, but these burns have also started to effect the middle-top portion of my scalp/widow peak. I'm scared to go bald especially if there's anything I could do before it's too late. I'm not able to go to a doctor or get a physical examination. My mom refuses to take me and I'll never be taken seriously. you guys are my only hope\n\n**pictures**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/FHxSAoM](https://imgur.com/a/FHxSAoM)", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

About 4y. ago I \\[24F\\] developed some unusual symptoms. Every now and then, when I feel as if I caught random flu, I'd also get + these only two unusual symptoms:1) intense blood rush(as if I was hanging upside -down) towards my head every time I bend it over slightly (even for opening desk drawer in my office) and 2nd weird one is that I keep feeling strange air bubbles running up and exploding inside my nose. This air in the nose is completely random and has almost nothing to do if I bend my head or not, but super weird and disgusting feeling. These symptoms like any flu lasts only 2-4 days and goes away. Then everything is normal. But after month or so it comes back (lately more often). One doctor kind of diagnosed me with Sinusitis. Performed x-ray, prescribed medication. No mucus came from my nose. I went to another doctor after 6 months who can manually check and see any sinusitis. Which he confirmed I don't have and said that x-ray is old fashioned method. He suggested vertigo. But I know quite few people who have vertigo, they get nausea, disorientation etc which I don't, unless this vertigo varies in different spectrum? Any ideas? There was suggestion from another family doctor that it has something to do with posture and spine, and there is nothing to worry about.. All of them seem like its not life threatening symptoms, but I cant help my self but worry a bit as it is indeed unpleasant feeling and I would like if not cure it at least start trying to improve and finally get to know exactly what it is. I'd like to start getting examination of full body. But its tricky and would be helpful if someone have any ideas what areas specifically I can test? MRI for brain? Any insight would be helpful. Also please note I'm really not the person who is freaking out for every little thing when it comes to the health, most of my life I've been pretty ignorant and chose to suffer rather to go and get help (which is wrong), but I perceive from all docs that they assume I'm just another crazy hypochondriac, when in reality it's the first time I'm trying to take care of my self!

I thought what I went through was normal until I got to high school and talked to people and no one else had these thoughts. I've never been sure of what I have or have had the means to get formally diagnosed. When you hear about people having ocd they normally talk about it being a fixation on a specific thing like germs or something. But that's not me. I get fixated on random things but they are recurring every now and again.\n\nFor example, I've always had this thing where when I sniffle I need to follow it by clearing my throat, then swallow, then blink a few times until I feel it is satisfactory (idk how to explain this it's just a feeling with all of the triggers is I do them until it just feels \"right\"). If any of those steps are messed up I do it until it's right which can take minutes. This one kind of goes away. Like I dont need to do it for a while but then after a few months it starts triggering me again. Right now for some reason I do it mainly when I'm eating.\n\nAnother example which is more recent and completely new, whenever I dring out of a straw I have to put it in between by front teeth in the back and kind of slide it down between them in a certain way every time I take a sip and if it's not \"right\" I do it again.\n\nThinking back on my life I've always dealt with it and tried to fight it. Like when I was youger I'd be on a computer and when I left it the mouse needed to be exactly in the middle of the mouse pad. I remember hating this and trying to ignore it but after so much time needing to go back and fix it because I couldn't leave it. If I got a drink and set the glass down wrong I'd need to refill it and drink again until I set it down right and this could happen to the point of almost throwing up. When I was in 5th or 6th grade I remember having problems breathing. We went and got me checked out and no one knew what was wrong with me. They gave me an inhaler anyway just in case. Thinking back on it I think it was ocd. The problem was sometimes I didn't feel like I was get enough air. To satisfy it I had to take a deep breath until it felt satisfactory than I'd be fine for a while until it happened again. I was getting plenty of air but my brain said I needed to get a certain amount and I couldn't stop taking deep breaths until I got it.\n\nAlso sometimes I have thoughts of scenarios that I have to think about over and over again until I think about them right. This is normally the worst because this can take upwards of 30 minutes to get over it. I've been sitting in classes and have missed entire lectures due to it and its impacted my schooling and life I  general.\n\nThere are other things but those are main points I wanted to type out quickly to see what people thought. I know this is no substitute for real professional help but I dont know if I'm ready for that and just kind of wanted an idea if I'm just overthinking everything or if I do have a problem and should seek help in the future", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I had balance testing done through my ENT and that was also normal.

I had an ultrasound of my stomach back in 2017 which was normal. Echocardiogram that was normal. I had tilt table testing done to test for POTS and the first 10 minutes were normal but I had severe symptoms when given the nitroglycerin. Ultimately, that test was also ruled normal.

First, the basics:\n\nI'm a 33 yo white female in Canada (west coast), 5'5\", about 150 lbs. I'm a therapist in a hospital, so generally very familiar with common medical issues but don't have the extensive training/experience of a doctor or nurse.\n\nPMHx: polycystic ovarian syndrome (No family history of any lung problems)\n\nMeds: oral birth control (Diane 35), spironolactone (50 mg/day), &amp; Welbutrin (300 mg/day). Never smoked, no street drugs.\n\nThe deal: I feel this pressure in my chest like my lungs can't expand fully to take a deep, comfortable breath. It feels like something catches right at the end of the inhalation, stopping my chest or lungs from expanding to their max capacity. Once in awhile, I am able to get a full breath and I can feel a physical \"release\" of something expanding fully in my lungs. (The best comparison I can use to describe the sensation is like a spastic muscle releasing and getting a full stretch, except it's happening inside my chest.) I'm often able to achieve a full breath when I change positions, particularly if I stand up and bend forwards a little at the waist. It's also easier to get a full breath when I yawn but isn't successful every time. Breathing feels marginally less comfortable lying on my back and marginally more comfortable lying on my stomach (I know. Weird.) Paradoxically, the only time I feel any sustained relief is when I lie on my stomach and someone puts deep pressure on my upper back, right around the inferior angle of my scapula (not particularly easy or dignified to achieve at work...\n\nIt's been going on for about a week. It's the third time it's happened in the last 6 months and the other 2 times lasted about 2 weeks each, but weren't nearly as uncomfortable as this time around. My O2 sats are normal (97-99% SpO2) but subjectively, I feel like I'm being slowly suffocated until I manage to get the next full, normal breath. Heart rate is a little elevated, around 90-95 BPM (usual resting rate is around 80). BP is normal, 122/80 (bang on my usual baseline). No cold/flu symptoms or sick contacts, no major stressors/anxiety triggers (please, please don't suggest \"some people feel this way when they're anxious sooooo...\" It's not anxiety.)\n\nI've seen 2 doctors so far: one diagnosed me with \"allergic reaction\" after a (literal) 30 second examination, the other diagnosed me with \"you are experiencing a sensation\" after 5 hours in the ER. Their observations:\n\nLung sounds: normal\n\nECG: normal\n\nChest X-ray: normal\n\nPeak flow: normal\n\nD-dimer: normal\n\nStuff I've tried already that hasn't worked:\n\nDiaphragmatic breathing\n\nMeditation\n\nVentolin\n\nAntihistamine\n\nMuscle relaxant/analgesic combo\n\nI'm obviously not dying or even in imminent danger, but this suffocating sensation is AWFUL and I'm suffering.

{"post_id": "cqxunn", "created_utc": 1565911486, "title": "ADHD/ADD - Carb induced narcolepsy", "author": "deezboot", "self_text": "\n\nJust to say this text below took me a number of weeks to type out as I had to keep coming back to it. \n\nI was a very bright normal child, when I turned 12/13 I started to fall a sleep all the time, this was nearly always after eating. Not just lethargic or low energy. I would drop a sleep. As well as this i got no energy from food at all, if anything i had more energy the less i ate. My parents put this down to being a teenager. This is when my attention and focus seemed to disappear.\n\nFocusing on anything for any length of time caused me great discomfort, at times became painful, causing head aches, sometimes even putting me to sleep. This got worse as I got older\n\nIn my late teens I used to have frequent spells where my heart would start racing for no reason, usually at night. It was as if I had be pumped full of adrenaline, like something out a movie, really beating so hard and fast I thought it would burst. One night I got up and asked my parents to feel my chest, they thought I was having a heart attack. They convinced me to see a doctor, they referred me to a heart specialist. At the time I was sleeping all the time. The doctor said there was nothing wrong. \n\nAs I went into my 20s still constantly tired all the time, I started to get depressed. This happened almost like clock work, after so many months I\u2019d have a point where I had to take a week off from work, relationships, everything and just sleep. \nI felt like my brain had run out of something and sleeping helped.\n\nOver my 20s my diet was a lot of sugar and caffeine to stay awake. Consuming large amounts of cola. This kept me awake and functioning, however left me falling dropping a sleep without any notice.During this time, i set fire to my flat a number of times falling a sleep while cooking, I was disciplined at work for sleeping in, as well as dropping out of college due to non attendance due to sleeping in. I also started developing sores on my scalp and my scalp started to become red and inflamed as well as losing hair, this never went away and still effects me today. \n\nIn my mid 20s I started taking modafinil, I also changed my diet to first no gluten then to high fat low carbs to see if this would help with my energy levels. It did. I got a promotion, a stable relationship. My focus and concentration however were still terrible and I would still be tired all the time, just not to the same extent. \nHowever whenever I had a high carb meal, I would revert back to sleeping all the time. Dropping a sleep after work.\n\nIn October last year I started getting a pain in my lower right side, it was painful but I thought it would go away.  I was no longer fully digesting my food properly, even easily digestible foods where making their away unchanged though my body, it was as if I wasn\u2019t making any stomach acid at all. \n\nIn January this year I decided to reach out privately to help fix my focus and concentration, previous GPs had all said there was nothing wrong with me for the last 17 years. I was diagnosed with ADHD with attention and focus being the main issue. I came off modafinil and went on long acting stimulant lisdexamfetamine, which put me to sleep after after a few hours. After 6 weeks I changed to Ritalin. This also put me to sleep quicker. Both very similar to when I would fall a sleep through a high carb meal. It was like taking sleeping pill.\n\nDuring this time I had private tests done to see if I could find the root cause of the pain in my right side. This showed higher than normal prolactin levels. My doctor dealing with the ADHD told me he had never heard of anyone having High prolactin levels with out taking anti psychotics, which i was not,  I asked if this could have effected the way the medication was working and contributing to my falling a sleep? I was told no. He told me he did not feel comfortable treating me further as he wanted me to have the prolactin issue looked at.\n\nI went back on modafinil however now it does nothing what so ever. So after a few weeks I stopped taking it again. \n\nMy GP at the time did a test for food poisoning, which I tested positive for. She said I most likely had it for weeks, I was put on antibiotics. I think this is due to the lack of stomach acid. \n\nI saw an endocrinologist who said that the prolactin was twice that of a normal man. But not enough to indicate a tumour, from January to May I have had 4 prolactin tests all the same result. He said that it most likely is depression. Which I feel is something doctors say when they don\u2019t know what the cause is. \n\nMy DHEAs has been over the normal range into the high range for years also. \n\nI\u2019ve had my B12, active b12, cortisol, oestrogen, testosterone, tested all normal. Which my endo told me was strange as prolactin which is high normally increases oestrogen and lowers testosterone however this is the case. But nothing to worry about. \n\nRecently I have tried selegiline and Phenethylamine. It was out of this world. To high a dose of Phenethylamine and I lose the use of my legs. I have to let down for at least an hour. However when this passes, I feel like how I imagine Ritalin should feel. Focused. Alert. Full of energy. \nWhy does this work and Ritalin doesn\u2019t? \n\nI\u2019m now 30, I\u2019ve had years of sleeping and years of no focus. I\u2019ve never read a book and I have dropped out of education multiple times. I am worried about my health as I get older. But also I want to use my life to do something, and without focus and energy it seems like pushing water up a hill.  \n\nI am looking for help to get to the bottom of what could be broken that is effecting my attention and energy. Also if this is connected to my digestive and hormonal problems. \n\nAny help would be amazing. \n\nThank you", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I can see, hear, smell, taste, touch, feel pain and think to a certain degree, but that's all there is. I don't feel happiness, sadness or \"moods\" (I can remember how things like christmas and rainy weather made me \"feel\" a certain way). It's completely empty in my head except for rare occasions where I just randomly decide to think in language, or when I read/write. \n\nNow the weird thing that makes me think it's not just depression or anything like that is how I'm acting just like someone with emotions. I can laugh with my friends and cry watching a sad movie, but my head will be completely empty no matter what I'm doing. When good things happen to me I will act more cheerful, even alone, despite not actually consciously experiencing anything different. It's as if all the feelings and decision making is happening somewhere else in my brain, outside of my consciousness. \n\nSo basically my body will feel happy and sad, but my conscious experience remains the same, absolutely nothing. This is a big problem for my life, because it seems to give me these extreme motivation issues. When I exercise, go to work and socialize with friends my subconscious might be happy, but it doesn't really matter to me because I'm not receiving any of the benefits. No matter what I do I just feel the same, and any action that that isn't sleeping or chasing some empty dopamine hit requires an enormous amount of effort that just isn't possible for me to put in very frequently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome additonal information: \n\nI have severe memory problems, I can't recall anything on my own without something that reminds me of the memory. I can hold somewhat normal conversations, but I can't remember the specifics of anything that's being said, just the general topic. I find myself forgetting words a lot.\n\nI can't really delay gratification anymore. Although I'm at a healthy weight right now, it's only because it's tedious to go buy food. If I had easy access to food without needing to go out and buy it myself, I'd probably be obese. Food is the only real desire I have in life right now, although I'd definitely be doing drugs as well if I ever tried them out.\n\nOne year ago I had a really good dream where I actually felt feelings for the first time in 4 years, it had a big impact on me and made me stop going to work and eventually quit (haven't had a job since). I remember everything seeming extremely unbearable and pointless in the weeks after I had the dream, I spent a lot of time just laying in bed crying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, working a job or following a routine like this is absolutely impossible. I can't even show up at my psychologist most of the time, so I am stuck in a cycle where no progress is being done. If I could find a lead on my condition it would be really amazing.

Spent this time trying to modify diet with no success - lost 30lbs.\n\nJuly 2019 - GI thinks it\u2019s SIBO, low FODMAP diet over 2 week course of Xifaxin resolves a lot of symptoms, diet expands - trigger foods are high fat, spice, sugar from here \n\nCurrent Symptoms:\nUnless I have very small meals, my stomach fills up and feels like all food just sits there without digesting regardless of content. \n\nFoods high in fat KILL me with intense bloating and pain - had sweet potato and squash tossed in oil and baked that put me in pain for three days \n\nBloating - severe with a full stomach, every morning I wake with a bloat that often does not resolve\n\nBowel Movements - used to have 3-5 a day prior to issues, now down to 1-2 in morning. \n\nDairy has always been an issue for me in high doses, but now I can\u2019t even tolerate butter used in cooking. \n\nI think it could be the SIBO still kicking around, or an ulcer. But who knows. CT scan, Ultrasound came back normal per the radiologist, going for endoscopy next week.\n\nEdit: Reddit noob - don\u2019t know how to add pics but I have extensive pics of before and after a meal showing the swelling.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I am a 20 year old Irish guy and I have been having some problems with my stomach since around May. I will be upfront and state that I have had an appalling diet over the years, consisting of pizza, curries, fatty foods and diet soda. It started when I felt unusually gassy after eating meals. Now I feel constantly nauseous (please note I have not vomited at all, yet) and am nearly always afraid of getting sick. I have some stomach pains from time to time - although the pain is nothing unbearable I am always in discomfort. Frankly the pain is very hard to describe - usually dull, sometimes sharp after eating heavy meals. I have very little appetite and have bad heartburn and acid reflux often when I eat. I have also been losing a lot of weight (my doctor has suggested this may be because I started a job last year with a lot of physical work involved).\n\nMy doctor has told me that he thinks it is likely I have either gallstones or a stomach ulcer. I am going for an ultrasound scan on Tuesday, which I am not too nervous about. If these results show nothing I will be going for an endoscopy to check my esophagus and stomach for any inflamation. I am extremely afraid that the endoscopy will show no results, and doctors will not be able to do anything for me. I am so scared that I will be in pain for the rest of my life and never enjoy any of the foods I love again. I have had serious issues with anxiety and depression (which I wonder might have caused this), but this has been one of the worst weeks of my life. On multiple occasions I have felt so afraid for my health that I was considering suicide as an option (I am in therapy). \n\nThrowing myself at your mercy.

Mom has MS, aunt had ALS. (only known family member with ALS). I work a desk job, lift weights regularly, eat healthy. Moderate anxiety.\n\n**Ulnar Symptoms**\n\nBeen having bilateral ulnar numbness in the pinky and ring fingers 8 weeks. 4 weeks ago I went to see my GP, he suspected nerve entrapment, but said it was a little unusual to have on both sides. This made me worry a bit.\n\nThe next day I woke up with brain fog, slight dizziness, and feeling slightly shaky and all limbs. Very slightly uncoordinated.\n\n**Twitching/Cramps Started**\n\nThe morning after that my calves started twitching. And after looking online, I basically had an ALS panic that I\u2019m still recovering from.\n\nA friend gave me low-dose Klonopin to manage the anxiety, which I\u2019ve been taking since then. Over the next 24 hours the twitches spread to my upper legs and abdomen, now it\u2019s in my arms as well.\n\nI got cramps in both hands and feet, and I visited Neurologist 1. He suspected BFS ([Benign Fasciculation Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_fasciculation_syndrome)) and told me to manage my anxiety and return in a week. Got an RX for Zoloft.\n\nI came back to Neuro 1 with worse twitching (more frequency, locations) and I was feeling a shakier and weaker in my movements. (e.g. Shaky when going down stairs, and my hands shake a lot when flexing my bicep.)\n\n**EMG, MRI, EEG, Bloodwork came back normal**\n\nPhysical neurological exam was normal. He ordered a brain MRI and a bunch of bloodwork, including electrolytes, B12, Creatine Kinase, Thyroid, and a ton more. Both the MRI and bloodwork came back normal.\n\nI was referred to another Neuro (2). Exam was normal, including a quick look at my mouth/tongue. He ordered an EEG, Nerve Conduction Study on 4 limbs, EMG on my arms, lumbar, and cervical area. All of these were clean. (Huge relief!)\n\n**Today:**\n\n\\- Widespread twitching below the neck.\n\n\\- All limbs are shaky and get tired really quickly. Right slightly more than left. More noticeable in the arms and hands.*I'm 99% sure that anxiety is not causing the weakness.  It might not be clinical, but it is something physical.  My anxiety has gotten a lot better, while the symptom has gotten worse.*\n\n\\- Hand/Foot cramps come and go, but are more mild now.\n\n\\- I get out of breath quickly.\n\n\\- Heart rate is noticeably higher and heavier than normal.\n\n**Still afraid of (bulbar?)

It also tends to get tired at the end of the day.  \n\\- I\u2019m aware that stress can cause [Muscle Tension Dysphonia](http://www.otolaryngology.pitt.edu/centers-excellence/voice-center/conditions-we-treat/muscle-tension-dysphonia), and hope this is the cause.\n\n\\- I\u2019m not slurring and do not have trouble swallowing. No tongue twitches that I\u2019ve noticed.\n\n\\- I read that the EMG can\u2019t detect Upper Motor Neuron issues, which bulbar is.  \n\n\nI\u2019ll be seeing Neuro 2 again in 1.5 weeks, and am inclined to ask about spinal issues, stenosis, myelopathy, etc. Maybe an MRI of the cervical spine?  Been trying to think of everything- I had a tick bite 10 years ago. Dormant Lyme? No idea.\n\nI could really use your feedback. Thank you so much.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

In the fall of 2013, I had salmonella and after about 2  weeks it went away on its own. Since then I had issues with my  stomach/abdomen. Sometimes when I would eat food I would get extreme  cramping pain in my stomach/abdomen, and that would be followed by  diarrhea. It would continue until there is nothing left in my digestive  track. This has been going on and off for years. In highschool it  happened for days on end minimum once a month. I have been to the  hospital for it and I have had multiple tests done. I have had a:  colonoscopy, endoscopy, a test where I had to drink this type of liquid  and they watched it pass through my system on an xray or something like  that, I've had blood and stool tests for salmonella, worms, bugs,  bacteria imbalances, and celiacs, yet everything came back normal. I  have also been treated for Giardia.\n\nI  have tried probiotics, antibiotics, over the counter stomach helpers  like Tums or Pepcid AC and none of it did anything. I have gone on  gluten free diets for multiple weeks and it has had no effects, still  problems. I have been taking dicyclomine and loperamide daily for over a  year now to try to deal with the symptoms and it usually works.\n\nHowever,  this past month has been particularly horrible. Cramping pain in my  abdomen that rates a 9 out of 10 on the pain scale. Explosive, violent  diarrhea follows the pain. I have been eating nothing but plain white  rice, as that is the only thing that does not cause me pain. In the last  2 months I have lost 10 pounds. I currently weigh around 125 pounds,  when at the start of summer I was 137. A year ago I was around 140 to  145 pounds.\n\nFor  the last 3 weeks I have been eating nothing more than 200 calories a  day in plain white rice and plain bread. I can see myself turning into a  skeleton. I don't have any energy and I am slowly starving to death. I  am actively going to doctors however they do not see anything wrong with  me. I just had a second endoscopy and colonoscopy done this past week  and everything looked good. I am actively having diarrhea and extreme  abdominal cramping pain every single day. I only drink water. The pain  is so bad that I am too afraid to eat anything.\n\nI  am legitimately terrified for my life right now. I had to quit my job  because I cannot do anything other than sit around and wait for  pain/diarrhea.\n\nPlease I will answer any questions you people have, I am honestly begging for someone to help me.

I had my neck craned down reading cards in my hand while she finished her turn, and started to smell iron. \n\nI said \u201cwhoa, i kinda smell iron, is this what a nosebleed is like? I might be having a nosebleed\u201d (never had one) and suddenly I felt a rush as my nose decompressed, and a wave went up my sinuses and over the top of my head. I also had a tight chest, felt nauseous, and my legs felt sort of numb (felt like being high on an edible). Afterward, I was spacey and couldn\u2019t think very straight, and felt a feeling of \u201cbrain activity.\u201d It felt like my brain was working hard but I wasn\u2019t doing it. It was a frustrating feeling. I also felt some pain on the right side of my head. \n\nI was really freaked out so we went to the ER just to make sure it wasn\u2019t like some aneurysm and I had a CT scan and an EKG,  both of which showed nothing out of the ordinary. I wanted an EEG as soon as I got there to see if it was some kind of seizure but it was multiple hours of waiting so that was a bust. Bloodwork came back normal as well.\n\nSince then I\u2019ve had some similar episodes of feeling, no two exactly the same but usually milder than described above. Maybe a few times a month. I\u2019ve had an MRI of my brain with and without contrast that looked good, and an APRN said she\u2019d be interested in an MRI of my cervical spine (C1, C2 area I think?) but I don\u2019t want to shell out for it yet since it doesn\u2019t seem life threatening.\n\nMy most notable symptoms/attacks since March are:\n\nLooking down at my phone during a night class and feeling tooth sensitivity and a lightning bolt of pain down the right side of my face that scared the hell out of me.\n\nAnd couple of days ago I was in bed watching YouTube at night and had minor symptoms. I ignored them since it\u2019s never been harmful before and I was trying not to add a panic response to my symptoms to have a more accurate judgement of what I\u2019ve been experiencing. 10 minutes after that, I felt sinus build up that released into a wave over my brain as my eyes felt sort of crossed. I had a retainer in so I couldn\u2019t tell if I was actually slurred but my brain felt like it was tough as I said \u201choney honey honey\u201d to wake up my girlfriend. It was the closest I\u2019ve been to losing vision/going unconscious during an episode, and my right hand became numb very suddenly mainly in my pinky and ring finger and radiating out into my hand and wrist. \n\nTypically it seems to happen when my neck is at an angle while I\u2019m laying down, and often when I\u2019m focusing on something (like the game card or my phone). I\u2019ve never been unconscious and each episode is less than 10 seconds. (If I have brain fog it may linger for 30min or so)\n\nSorry for the wall but I wanted to give as much detail as I could!

I have tried to sum everything up as best I can, as well as keeping it easy to read. \nTo start: I'm a 25 year old female. I am 5'3.5\" and currently weigh 155, although my weight shifts quickly. I have many diagnoses, but we also do not know for sure what is going on. My current diagnosis is Hemiegic migraines and a general joint hypermobility. I have Meniere's disease and gastroparesis as well. I am deaf in my left ear and have vision problems and glasses. I also have sub-centimeter nodes in thyroid. I have been considered for MS, Ehlers-danlos, lyme, and a mess of other disorders. \n\nI feel as though everything I face is interconnected, but I don't know how so I will put my known history. My symptoms and odd findings:\nCould not eat as an infant. Continued abdominal pain and full body dislocations and sublexes. This has lead to many injuries from sprains to tears. Doughy, slightly stretchy skin randomly bleeds underneath, causing small dot-like bruising. Doesn't heal well and easily tears.First surgery at 11 revealed twisted bowel and filopian tube, however completely covered in adhesions with no know cause. Gallbladder removed at 17, covered in scar tissue. Colonoscopy at 19 revealed bowel twisted in scar tissue. \nGastric problems persistent. Have gastroparesis and stomach inflamation. Constant abdominal pain. Recently had esophagus dialated and diagnosed with a circopharyngeal disorder(cannot remember name will edit upon finding paperwork). Many foods trigger allergenic symptoms and sensitivities, such as tree nuts, gluten amd lactose that have developed over time. Migraines entire life. First experience with numbess at 13-15. Continued off and on. \nExperienced multiple miscarriages. First live child at 20, complications included bleeding, early contractions requiring bed rest. Born via emergency c-section after 18hour labor, caught in hip. At 23 had second live child after another miscarriage, born via planned c-section. Similar complications as first child. \nDirectly after c-section: Personal health deteriorated. Experinced full paralysis on right side leg and hand. At the same time experienced shooting electrical like pains down spine, from base of skull tail-bone. Migraines worsened. Brain Fog and swollowing problems. Seizures and memory problems. Extreme musculoskeletal pain. Speech problems. Was given multiple medications from gabapenten to topamax. Topamax 200mg twice a day eventually aided in symptoms lessening. Took over a year to to be able to walk and still experience numbness occasionally. First diagnosis was MS or b12 deficiency, tests came back negative. Was diagnosed Hemiplegic Migraines, but also told they were unsure what it was. Most symptoms still persist and seem similar to experinces throughout childhood and teen years, only increased in severity. Mentally I have been diagnosed with PTSD, Major and Post-partum depression, general anxiety. Possible Aspergers. Doctors do not believe mental condition causes physical condition due to preexisting before mental condition started. Believed mental conditions may be caused or worsened by physical condition, though stress makes all worse.

I am 21 years old, female, mixed race (European/middle eastern), 5'6'', and 145 pounds. My previous medical history includes hypertension, 180 over something, but I treat that with medication. I'm also vitamin d deficient. Other than that, my family and I do not have any history of debilitating diseases, mental or physical. \n\nI've recently experienced life altering occurrences. I do not know if this is related, but back in October I had flu like symptoms that lasted for about 2 weeks. I had fevers and chills, as well as muscle spasms and joint pain. Six weeks prior to this I had unprotected sex. Later, I thought these instances were somehow related. Fast forward to February, I start experiencing a series of strange symptoms. First it started with a really intense chill that ran through my legs and to my butt. The chill was so intense that it was painful.  To the touch, my skin felt fine, but inside was freezing. Then there was an instance where a wave went over me and I felt like I was going to fall over. At another point, my hearing was shot, but it came back within moments. Soon after I started experiencing an intense tingling in my brain and stomach. After a few days, this went away as well, but I've noticed lasting damage. After this happened my face started to twitch uncontrollably for a few days, my lip as well as the area above my eyebrow. This too went away, but the issues that remain have to do with my brain itself. I no longer have the same cognitive ability. I was in school with a full academic scholarship, but this has caused me to request for a break of sorts, as I can no longer function in class. I couldn't do simple math, and I can no longer think of simple things to say. My conversation skills have deteriorated, like the next idea of what to say never comes. I used to have a sense of humor too, but that is completely gone now. Also, I used to be extremely ticklish, but now I feel nothing to that sort of touch. It's like there is a disconnect between my nerves and my brain. I've also noticed I never feel hungry anymore. I never get hunger pains, my stomach never growls. Anyway, I thought this could somehow be related to me having unprotected sex. I was struggling to find answers through this and read that HIV can cause CNS/brain issues. But I've been tested for everything, including HIV, countless times and always came out negative. I also did an MRI on my brain and everything appeared normal. All of the structures of my brain are normal, and nothing has ruptured. I don't know if this is a post viral syndrome type issue or a neurological problem. \n\nI've also been tested for autoimmune diseases, like lupus for example, but nothing came up. \n\nIt has been brought to my attention that it could be Lyme disease, which I'll request to get tested for. I don't live in an area where tics are common though, and I've never seen a tick on my body or been bitten by one to my knowledge. And I have never gotten the bulls eye rash that is typical of an infection. \n\nSomeone else mentioned MS. I'll admit that I know little of the disease, and a doctor has never questioned me about it. \n\nI'm posting here because no doctor can seem to figure out what the issue is. My problems were discounted so often, doctors claiming it could be an anxiety or mental issue, that I went to a psychiatrist and a psychologist to see if such notions were valid. Both the psychiatrist and psychologist claimed that I did not have a mental or emotional issue- that it must be something else. \n\nI really need help. This has essentially ruined my life. I can't perform academically, and I've lost a lot of friends/contacts as I don't seem to be the person I used to be. Thank you for reading this long post.

I am getting kind of desperate for answers on this.\n\nI am 34 year old male, about 185 pounds for context. I don\u2019t smoke, but do drink alcohol which I should probably cut back on (about 4 times a week). Back in January of this year I had my parents drive me to the ER because it felt like my heart was beating through my chest. As I was walking my dog I felt a tingle go down the left side of my body and I went in to panic mode, I could then feel my heart absolutely racing and I could not do anything to slow it down. Fast forward to the ER I checked in with a heart rate over 150, but thankfully I was not having heart attack like I thought I was. They did a chest X-ray and whatever other typical tests they do for an ER visit and found nothing except a slightly decreased potassium level. Earlier in the day I did have a large cup of coffee, and an energy drink a couple hours after, and a couple of beers. I know that was stupid. So they sent me home and said this was due to all of the caffeine I had that day along with the decreased potassium level.\n\nI decided to quit drinking alcohol and coffee cold turkey at the time, but I just did not feel right for months after while I did this. I would feel occasionally light headed, foggy, got some shortness of breath, would get recurring burping spells, got what I thought were heart palpitations (halter monitor I later wore didn\u2019t show any), my hands would feel colder than usual on occasion, and I was just kind of always afraid I was going to drop dead of a heart attack. I kept googling and looking for answers while I waited to see a cardiologist and came across a post of someone who said they had similar symptoms from caffeine withdrawal (I have always been a pretty big caffeine drinker, about 3 cups of coffee a day). So I decided to ease my way back in to caffeine and pretty much all of the symptoms went away when I did\u2026 except the burping.\n\nSo I went to a cardiologist and got an echo-cardiogram, I wore a halter monitor for 48 hours, and got a stress test on a treadmill. All the results came back perfectly normal. My cardiologist called to ensure me that I have a very strong heart (she knew I was kind of a wreck at this point so it was nice she used those words to describe the results to comfort me). My blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not to the point of medication but because of that I always get anxious about heart things. I also have a touch of white coat syndrome in that I absolutely hate getting my blood pressure taken by someone, I can\u2019t really explain that. Anyway I kind of chalked the burping up to anxiety thanks to google, and the previous symptoms up to caffeine withdrawal and went on about my life. But one thing that hasn\u2019t gone away is the burping. It comes and goes, some days I will feel mostly normal, then all of a sudden I will have a full on burp attack. Like it is not just a couple of burps, I am burping hardcore for 15 minutes straight sometimes. And I feel like I have to burp every other breath. I have to do the thing where I force myself to burp because it feels like I absolutely have to let that air out of my chest. I can\u2019t take a deep breath until after I let out one of these long burps. Letting the air out with a big burp feels temporarily so good, but it builds back up in the next couple of breaths and out come more burps. Eventually they do subside, but while it is happening I put myself in to almost a full blown panic attack. I once read somewhere burping can be a sign that you are having a heart attack so I just always assume this is something with my heart when it starts. But since my cardiologist said I was fine, I then decided to go to a gastro. I now kind of thought that I either had GERD or perhaps worst case stomach cancer. They performed an upper endoscopy and found nothing except \u201cslight acid reflux\u201d. She said very minimal. So there is no way that explains the intensity of the burping I am getting. \n\nDoes anyone have any idea what this is a symptom of? I google excessive burping and heart, and angina pectoris comes up. Could I have that? Would the echocardio/chest xray/stress test/halter monitor have caught that? If not, how do I test for that? Is it just anxiety? Could it be a stomach issue the endoscopy did not catch? I am not expecting answers to all of these questions, that\u2019s just kind of my stream of consciousness always present worries. But since this all started in the immediate aftermath of my ER visit for a spiked heart rate I am just assuming this has something to do with that, but I guess it\u2019s a possibility this is independent of that. It just doesn\u2019t seem likely to me. I don\u2019t even know who to ask anymore, none of my doctors seem concerned (my primary, gastro, or my cardiologist) which I guess is a little comforting, but I am extremely concerned. It just does not feel normal. It\u2019s driving me crazy and when it happens it is honestly very scary. If anyone could give me any insight on maybe tests to ask for, or if you have come across anything like this before I would be hugely appreciative of any information I can get. Sorry for the wall of text!\n\nTLDR: I have been getting hardcore excessive burping attacks since January when I was admitted to the ER for a spiked heart rate that was kicked off by excessive caffeine consumption coupled with alcohol. Cardiologist said I\u2019m fine, Gastro said I\u2019m fine, Primary said I\u2019m fine, but I never had these attacks before that issue and they are now driving me insane. Could I have a heart issue my cardio did not catch? Angina pectoris? What else could this be? Are there any tests I should ask for outside of what I have already had (Chest x-ray, echo cardiogram, treadmill stress test, 48 hour halter monitor, upper endoscopy). I am really desperate for answers so any and all input is really appreciated. Thank you!!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I am currently seeing a doctor for this issue, but I have to admit that it's confusing me, and my doctor doesn't have a clear diagnosis yet either.  \n\n\nI'm 34 and 190 lbs. I'm 8 months postpartum (C-section) but my weight is not from my pregnancy; I lost that pretty quickly. I wrote a post back in May about my frustrations with weight loss here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/bp2eem/frustrated\\_with\\_weight\\_loss\\_and\\_it\\_aint\\_my\\_first/](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/bp2eem/frustrated_with_weight_loss_and_it_aint_my_first/)   \n\n\nAbout two months after writing that and having little to no success losing weight on my own, I went to a weight loss clinic. I'd rejected the idea of taking weight loss pills in the past, but I was desperate. (If this post doesn't make it clear, I regret the decision and won't be taking them again.) I got a month's prescription of phentermine and Topamax.  \n\n\nThe pills worked like gangbusters. I only took them for 10 days (and only a half-dose for the first few days) and lost 10 pounds. However, about a week into taking them, I noticed some irregular heartbeats while working out. On the 10th day, I went for a walk with my dog and baby, and when I got back, I noticed I was getting irregular heartbeats every few minutes and some shortness of breath. I called the nurse at the clinic, and she told me to stop taking it. I called a Teladoc doctor who agreed and advised me to check if the symptoms persisted beyond a week or two.  \n\n\nNow, it's been almost four weeks since i stopped taking it, and while the symptoms have improved, they're not gone. This is what I'm experiencing:  \n\\- Irregular heartbeat (PVC as noted on an EKG), particularly when my heart rate gets up to 120 or so and in the minutes/hours afterwards  \n\\- Shortness of breath (not gasping or dizziness, but just feeling like I'm not getting quite enough air) and occasional involuntary inhales, like I'm yawning without being tired  \n\\- A frequent sense of vascular tension; like I can feel my veins? Mostly in my upper body, but in other parts of my body too.   \n\\- Irregular period - this might not be related, but postpartum, my periods had been very far apart (6-7 weeks) and starting in July when I was taking the phentermine, I had three in a six-week period, which is odd for me.  \n\\- A strange, metallic taste in my mouth, which started when I was on the pill  \n\n\nSome other information that might be helpful:  \n\\- I don't have any pre-existing heart issue that I know of.   \n\\- My only other medication is Norlyda (birth control)  \n\\- I have low-level anxiety, but I feel like a lot of people are dismissing my symptoms as just being a month-long panic attack, and it's very frustrating. I'm not saying that worrying about it is helping, but these symptoms often happen when I'm relaxed or thinking about something else  \n\\- My resting heart rate has stayed relatively normal (in the 70s) and my weight has been more or less the same  \n\\- On the couple of occasions over the past month that I've had more than a drink or two, my symptoms were much more noticeable the next day  \n\\- I went to the doctor on Thursday: my chest X-ray was normal, my blood oxygen was normal, and my thyroid hormone was in the normal range. However, I was pretty easily able to get a PVC to appear on my EKG by jogging in place for a couple of minutes before taking the test.  \n\n\nI'm going in tomorrow to pick up a 48-hour heart monitor to get more information about the exact nature of my heart issue. If the problems seem severe enough, they might do an echocardiogram to see if there is any damage to the structures of the heart.   \n\n\nI just don't get it. How am I still having these symptoms so long after stopping the phentermine, and after taking it for such a short time? I'm so confused, and worried that I've done permanent damage to my body. :( Any ideas would be appreciated.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

The ENT says as a last ditch effort he will perform a balloon sinuplasty on my sinuses and a tuboplasty on my estuchian tubes. Currently I\u2019ve been up all night with this right ear pressure/fullness/pain freaking out that I\u2019m going to have this fullness forever when 5 weeks ago I was completely normal. I\u2019m a manager at work and a father of 3 starting my masters program in just two weeks. If any ENTs or others could provide any insight I would greatly appreciate it.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

The pain, however, is still here, it's half past 11 on Monday here already, so it's becoming alarming. I suspected appendicitis, but these two are all the symptoms I have - other than that I have no other problematic symptoms like problems with defecation (diarrhea/constipation, though yesterday my poop was brown and slightly greenish at the end; this morning it was brown once again)/painful urination/fever/loss of apetite/vomiting (I vomit very rarely - haven't vomited since I was like 10 years old).\n\nYesterday afternoon I travelled over 150 km by bus, I carried a heavy backpack and the pain wasn't that bad but it became worse by the evening and it was especially painful when I lied down to sleep - I couldn't fall asleep so I talked to my roomates who were also awake and in the end I went back to try to sleep and some minutes after 3 am I fell asleep on my left side since the pain is on the right. The pain right now is like 6/10. My traumatized tooth was a lot more painful (the pain there left me out of breath at some point) than the pain I am going through now, but  it's still constant pain, so it's alarming, more or less. I'm eating yogurt and bananas right now. I ate a \"organic probiotic\" waffle in the morning as I was curious to try it anyway. I'm working from home at the moment.\n\nWhat could it be? Appendicitis? Some kind of hernia (because of the workout I went back to after not having trained for 3 months)? Just gas? Digestive problems? Colon infection? IBS? I have no idea. Some people told me that appandecitis should be located lower than that and be more painful, but I'm not sure. My personal GP is not in the same town so all I could was call him and he advised me to take medication (Buscolysin - no idea whether that's an international name but essentially it's hyoscine butylbromide) for 1 - 2 days max. and look for emergency services if it's not getting any better.\n\nUpdate (on the next day, 20 August): I got it checked by emergency services as the pain wasn't getting any better. It wasn't appendicitis, according to the doctors. Today I feel a bit better, even though there is still pain there. I'm wondering whether it's from the exercise I got back to after the unintentional 3 month break.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Upon discovering of the tumor(myxopappilary ependymoma) on my lower spine it was removed in 2008 at the age of 14 and was followed up to deal with a second tumor that was found that same month.

In 2014, due to lack of follow ups and me turning a blind eye to my situation the two tumors had regrown and moved up to my cerebellum.

I\u2019d like to preface that anxiety, ratings disorders, and any other mental disorder is off the table. I have been seen by multiple psychologists to rule them out. I\u2019m a 22 year old woman (Hispanic, 5\u20199, 180lbs) and I\u2019ve been athletic my whole life. Every time I work out, I get hives on my arms and sometimes they spread all over my body. My heart rate goes through the roof despite multiple normal EKGs. They have ruled out many heart diseases and conditions but nothing has seemed to relieve this. I vomit or have extreme heartburn after I eat or drink anything, including just plain water. I\u2019m fatigued almost every day and I\u2019ve had a couple new symptoms where my muscles spasm very quickly all over, not visibly, but it feels like my body is vibrating. When that happens, I get extremely sore and achey for days after. Along with that, I have some other odd symptoms.\n\nMy whole childhood, I had stomach problems; mostly vomiting and constipation. The first \u201cepisode\u201d I had was when I was about 6. I had just gone on a hike with my family and I started feeling sick in a way I had never felt before, and I had to sit down because I felt like I was going to fall over. My vision started getting blurry and then I saw colors flashing around and everything went black. I couldn\u2019t move, I could hear some things faintly but my eyes were wide open. No one took me to the doctor that time and it was basically forgotten. \n\nFast forward, when I was in middle school. I was getting ready for a basketball tournament and I got in the shower, a few minutes later, the same weird feeling came back and the spots, the vision going black, and not being able to move happened. This time, I could hear things more clearly during all this but I didn\u2019t actually know what was being said. My parents took me in to the ER when I woke up and they determined it was \u201ca normal teenage girl problem.\u201d Thankfully my parents didn\u2019t believe that and I went to my pediatrician the next day. However, he said the same thing. He said that teenage girls can be sensitive to hot water. 1) I was very well hydrated as I was in the middle of a tournament and 2) I was taking a cold shower to wake up. So that was an unexplained episode. \n\nIn high school, I ran a cross country meet and started feeling funky the minute I started. I got a horrible time and sat down after the race because I was so tired and drained feeling, I had never felt so horrible in my life. I was sitting there and I started getting spacey. Apparently my friend\u2019s mom came up to me and tried to speak to me but I wasn\u2019t making sense and I told her I was sick, luckily she\u2019s a nurse and she thought I was having heat stroke (on a 65 degree day...) but she called an ambulance and laid me down, she was doing everything she could to snap me out of it. Then I started shaking. Not like a seizure, but I was shivering all over and it didn\u2019t stop for 15 minutes. I don\u2019t remember anything. Apparently I was speaking and awake but when I felt like I finally snapped out of it, there was a giant crowd and it was a huge deal and I couldn\u2019t even remember where I was. The medics cleared me there and didn\u2019t even recommend going to the hospital. Luckily, my friend\u2019s mom, the nurse, told my parents to take me because something was wrong. They took me to the ER and they blamed it on dehydration. I was in and out of the ER for a week because the following days I was vomiting, I was having similar episodes that would just happen after doing nothing or just walking to the bathroom. I was so sick for about a week and then I was back to being a normal healthy kid. \n\nWhen I turned 18, another similar thing happened to the first two episodes and I went to my pediatrician and he blamed it on being a girl again. That\u2019s when I decided to seek a better doctor. It had been three years and nothing had happened, then I went to Europe for a few weeks. I came home and I was so sick. I thought I was actually dying one day. I had a really high fever, my back hurt, I was sweating and vomiting. They determined I had a kidney infection, but then later determined it wasn\u2019t and they didn\u2019t know what was wrong. This is the time that everything got really bad. I was literally fainting on a frequent basis and the fatigue was getting so bad some days I couldn\u2019t move. I was vomiting randomly and my heart rate goes crazy when I\u2019m up and moving. My blood pressure is always low and I\u2019ve been through dozens of tests where they can\u2019t find anything. Every doctor says I appear to be a healthy young woman but they believe that there is something going on inside of me. I have been bouncing between doctors and specialists trying to figure it out. I\u2019ve been hospitalized, so many ER visits, doctors office visits almost weekly. \n\nI\u2019m 22 and trying to get back to my \u201cnormal\u201d life, or maybe a life I haven\u2019t experienced yet. It\u2019s gotten so bad I can\u2019t run anymore, I can\u2019t rock climb or hike much either. My hobbies have been stripped and I had to quit track my sophomore year of college because I had an episode at practice one too many times. \n\nIf anyone has any ideas, literally anything, please reach out to me. I\u2019m desperate.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

During this time I spent most of my time in bed and in front of my computer, and did **absolutely nothing** for my physical health. I've had depression for 8 years and have never really been into working out, but before the past major depression period, I at least did something resembling exercise.  \nNow I have finally found my joy of living again, but I fear that joy is already crumbling down.\n\nI'm an artist and got accepted into my dream art school, but while drawing my pre-exam tests felt some strain in my right forearm. Now, this is very common among people who use the computer or draw a lot, so I wasn't too worried about that at first. I decided to just rest it and let it heal.  \nBut the pain kept increasing and I decided to see a doctor who told me to rest for two weeks and I also got a prescription for some medicine that should help with the infection she suspected was causing my problems.\n\nAfter these two weeks, the strain had gotten better but I still wasn't feeling my 100%, so I met up with a physiotherapist who gave me very helpful tips on how to prevent this injury in the future, and also gave me a green light to get back to my usual activities.  \nI went home full of excitement to draw again, but just after one evening of very chill drawing with stretching and work-out breaks every 30 minutes my forearm relapsed.\n\nAfter that I have picked up daily yoga, stopped drawing completely, stretch every 30-45 minutes when on the computer, and nothing helped.\n\nAfter 2 months passed I slowly felt myself going insane. That's the longest time ever in my life without drawing and I can actually feel it affecting my mental health. Every person has that one outlet and a thing they have a burning passion for, and art is mine.  \nA couple of weeks ago I took my last bit of savings and went to see a chiropractor who is one of the best in where I live in. She found multiple very tense deep muscles and helped to relax them, and after seeing her 4 times I was actually getting hopeful that my ordeal was finally over. She was very confident that we had found the root of the problem, and that now that school starts I should be able to use my hand almost normally already. She explained that my strain injury wasn't a common one (something I had already figured out since a normal strain injury should heal in about two weeks), and that all the strain and lack of movement during the past years was simply just too much for my body. But in her opinion, I should start seeing results very quickly and could say goodbye for the strain.\n\nBut during my first week of school I had to use the computer to edit videos for a couple of hours, and the pain and strain returned again. It's still very bad and I feel like I'm back at the beginning. I am beyond frustrated and terrified that my dreams of becoming a professional artist are destroyed.  \n\n\nSome more information about the pain and issue: when I rotate my right elbow and the right side of my upper back it doesn't move freely. It feels like two broken cogwheels trying to rotate. While rotating it also lets out a noise as if someone just stepped on a bag of uncooked pasta. My right-arm bicep muscles also feel very odd. I simply can't put it into words but in certain arm positions it feels like the muscle moves in a very unnatural way, a way in which I can't move my left bicep muscle at all. This also causes pain.  \nI have tried doctros, physiotherapist, chiropractor, painkillers, ointments, daily exercise, stretching, some very pricey all-natural ointment that didn't do shit, and I just don't know what to do anymore.  I don't even know in which direction to go for help.  \n\n\nI apologize if I come off as frustrated or irritated, I'm just very stressed about this issue and can feel the pain and strain in my forearm and shoulder while writing.  \nIf anyone has any tips or advice I'm more than happy to hear them all. Thank you.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I noticed it after getting a scab on the right middle of the shaft. Now I think this scab is because of a little too much playing with myself. It was the middle of summer exam week, and I probably masturbated anywhere from 9-12 times over a couple day period (I know way too much). The scab healed fine I put a bandaid on and some neosporin and its all gone.\n\nDuring that week though I thought I saw some discoloration on the left side that I assumed was from the same thing. It almost looked like a small and light brown bruise. I compare the color on the left side of the shaft to the clearly Irish white base of the penis. I do not think it has changed much color in the past month or two since the scab. I think I notice a little redness underneath foreskin once in a while as well.  I have never had an issue with urination or ejaculation including the couple days with scab. I have never had any pain except for the scab itself. I may have a little bit more sensitivity but I could be wrong. It is not an STD as that would require sexual transmission for which I have not participated in. Am I just crazy who never noticed the color of his genitals and thinks it is more sensitive because I am paranoid?\n\nShould I take a week or two off masturbation to see if it goes away, or should I see a doctor? I have not really withheld form masturbation since the scab went away.\n\nThanks a bunch!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I will often supplement this with caffeine pills (1-2+ per day). I can fall asleep easily, but when I started taking the abilify, I started waking up during the night.

As of 2 years ago, she has become more active and can\u2019t seem to stay in one place for long. This was one of the first things we started noticing. The next thing we noticed was her lack of presence in a conversation. This has gotten significantly worse over a 2 year period. You can be talking to her and visually see on her face that she is thinking something completely different, she is already 2 or 3 thoughts ahead and NEEDS to get whatever she is thinking out of her head. Not a millisecond will pass before you complete your sentence and she is already talking to you about something completely different. After that, we noticed she would repeat herself all the time, tell stories multiple times within minutes of each other to the same person. She will also ask the same questions over and over again to the point whoever is speaking to her becomes irritable. Sometimes she gets angry or upset about little things and doesn\u2019t seem to apply logic in those situations. One example is her fear of the dogs biting or ruining the blinds, when they have NEVER done anything of the sort. She goes out of her way to put things in front of the windows, lift the blinds a quarter of the way up, and a few other things that just seems so strange for something that doesn\u2019t happen. It is hard to describe in writing but these changes in her behavior are not just concerning, they are affecting the rest of the household\u2019s mood and relationships. \n\nWhat kind of health care provider should I seek out?

Results came in (Pic 1), my WBC was flagged as high and my RBC was flagged as low and he told me that it could be an iron deficiency and recommend that I take iron supplements (this was in May). \n\n\nI took the iron supplements for three months and did another follow up blood work (Pic 2). Again, my WBC increased and my RBC decreased despite not having a cold or other infection. Doctor recommended that I do a more specific type of test and received the results (Pic 3). \n\n\nI was hoping that someone could interpret what the results could mean. I am concerned with my WBC  increasing despite not having an infection. Could this be anemia related or is there something else that's going on? Also, could this be hypothyroidism?

If I'm not eating for days on end, it's always something like white rice and chicken...that's it. Nothing else. Everything scares me. Too much sugar, got to avoid that or I'll get *diabetes*\\--if I don't already have it. Too much salt, got to avoid that or I'll get *heart disease*\\--if I don't already have it. Too much cholesterol, definitely want to avoid that or I'll suffer a *heart attack or stroke-*\\-if I don't experience that soon. Too much spices, no can do--now I convinced myself I have *GERD* or stomach problems. I mean I have to, all the symptoms are there. And a doctor said it could be a *possibility*, not that I have it but that anyone can get it and that was half a year ago. So I must have it now, and why? Because someone posted a similar experience on Reddit that describes my current state and Google said so. Is it a stupid reason, obviously, but I convinced myself. It's not the fact that I went *three weeks* of not eating for days or *half a year* of eating poorly, ignoring fruits and vegetables. It's because I said so. And that's where I keep falling.\n\nI lost so much weight. And I can't accept that it has to do with me not eating or eating well. The pain I get, the discomfort, all over my body is screaming at me to get mental help, but I know nothing will change. Absolutely zero chances of actual progress. That at least I am certain. I don't want to eat anymore. I tried for a few days, trying to eat more and get out but I don't see the point. I'd rather give up on life. But I still got some fight left in me.\n\nThis isn't a cry for help, or anything like that. I see it, instead, as a brief discussion on whether or not my assumptions about my health are true or not. That maybe it could be more than anxiety, that maybe those doctors are withholding important details and that I wasn't crazy the whole time. So here it is.\n\nCan anxiety truly be linked to physical symptoms? Here are a list of my symptoms, followed by a list of illnesses that I have. **Symptoms**: weight loss, appetite loss, vision problems\u2014seeing floating stars or a blue dot in the corner of my eye, anxiousness, obsessive worrying, exhaustion, difficult sleeping, chest pain, difficult breathing, suicidal thoughts, dry hands, heart burn, a weird sensation in my chest and stomach. Illnesses: Stomach cancer, diabetes, hypertension, pancreatitis, hepatitis C, low and high blood pressure, nerve damage, crohn's disease.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

After that got treated for Epilepsy for 9 years even though I never had a seizure again.  Didnt have a tumor or anyone with epilepsy from my family so I don't know the cause but doctors said video games, hunger, tireness, lack of sleep triggered it.\n\nI don't know if the health problem I told above related to this but here we go:\n\nMy problem is once or twice a week I get this mild numbness in my left leg and a little numbness on my head as well. I never had this numbness on my right leg or any other body part and this is the same leg that became numb before I had the seizure. Whenever this happens I feel like my blood pressure dropped and I am going to faint. If im standing sometimes I suddenly take a step forward or backwards cuz I feel like I am going to lose my balance and fall. This happens for a brief second and then numbness go away. Went to the doctor once and blood tests showed that I had b12 deficiency. Had some b12 pills and it helped a bit but it didnt cure it and this was also years ago. I have this complain for more than 7-8 years maybe. I really can't remember. I rarely have a really heavy muscle pain under my left foot when I lay down but after standing up and pressing my left leg to the floor pain goes away. But I don't know if this is related to my problem.\n\nAgain sorry for my poor English. I hope you can help me :)", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

It's like if you take ALL the symptoms or when your ears are ringing but there is no ringing in your ears.

Only change I'm trying to stick to is not eating after 7:00 PM.  \nAlong with the diet change I've been trying to eat more vegetables, mainly spinach is the newest addition to my diet.

Nothing strenuous, not entirely sedentary. Most of my adult life has seen this consistently.  \nSleeping habits have not really changed much at all over the years.\n\nGoogle isn't helpful.

People started to notice my balding when I was around 13/14, about the time I started puberty. I thought it would be same thing that I had when I was 11. When I was 11, I saw increased hair fall, with my hair itching. But it stopped, so I did not pay attention to it. So when I was 13/14, people started noticing bald spots. It was not that bad. Thinking it would end, I never cared. It just got worse and worse exponentially. When I turned 15, I noticed a medium sized spot on the mid-scalp region. I went to my dermatologist, they said it was just that I had long hair. Then it kept on going, and I turned 16. It got worse, then I chose to got to my primary doctor. After examining my hair, I had a lot of red spots on my scalp, and my scalp was a little itchy. They diagnosed me with dermatitis, and prescribed me selenium shampoo. It helped with the red spots, for a few weeks, but the spots ended up coming back. My scalp got more itchy after I using the medication. Then I went back, then they diagnosed me with folliculitis. They prescribed me minocycline to help with it. It did not help at all, so I went back to my dermatologist. At this point I had multiple patches of bald spots. The spots were on the side, and on the top of my scalp of my scalp. The weird thing is that there is still a little hair growing out of the spots which helps fill my hair. Also, I sometimes see white things when my hair falls out. It could be dandruff(I have some problem with dandruff) or dead skin. Another thing, that some of the hair strands have like a miniature black orb surrounding the end of the strand. Also sometimes, there is white coloring at the end of the hair.

I'm going to try my luck here on my odd condition.\nAbout myself: 22M, healthy lifestyle, I never smoke or drink. I have been doing weight training at the gym for a long time now, and have been occasionally sleeping with my air conditioning on. I believe you can help me diagnose my condition. \n\nSo about a less than decade ago, one morning I woke up in my bed, and suddenly this really loud cracking sound came out of my neck, I couldn't move my neck an inch without feeling intense pain.\n\nI was called an ambulance, given pain reduction treatment, and resumed to be able to move my neck again almost completely within two days.\n\nBut one thing didn't feel right even after I healed, and it still doesn't.\nEver since, my neck, or rather, the top of my spinal cord, has been feeling stiff, whenever I move my neck mildly to the sides, I can hear countless silent pops or cracks, as if something in my neck is constantly grinding. Some days it's better, sometimes it's worse. This does not restrict my movement albeit mild discomfort.\n\nOver the years I've come to learn that some things immediately make the pain in my neck worse. I've found the following to be porportionally related to my stiffness / pain / discomfort:\n\n- Apthaes, which are mouth/tongue sores, make my neck hurt significantly to an almost unbearable degree. If I apply mouthwash, then mid-wash, when the Apthaes hurt the most, so does my neck. Then post-wash, when the Aphtae is numb, the discomfort in my neck is better. I have no idea how these things relate.\n- Air Conditioning, when cold, makes my neck feel uneasy.\n- When I am thirsty, passive discomfort and stiffness becomes pain.\n\nSome things make my neck feel better, only to eventually return to its general stiffness in less than 2 minutes. Which oddly, are:\n\n- Doing plenty of crunches in fast pace make the stiffness in my neck temporarily go away completely for mere moments.\n- Sometimes actively causing pops in my neck where it is stiff loosens the stiffness a bit.\n- Sleeping with no pillow has contributed with feeling better.\n\nI have tried several treatments and attempts in diagnosing my condition, with no success at all:\n\n- MRI and CTs, with nothing irregular in the results, doctors say everything looks okay.\n- As no irregular results are shown from my tests, doctors can't pinpoint my issue and don't recommend surgery.\n- I have tried Chiropractic sessions with lots of different professionals over the years, Twi-Na, Shiatsu, and Neck messages too.\n- I have tried stopping weight training completely. This did not make my neck feel somewhat better.\n\nTld;r-  I have constant Mild Discomfort and Stiffness in the beginning of my spinal cord, at the back of my neck for 8 years now - after waking up one day with a huge 'pop' sound in my neck.

It\u2019s not painful, just like a weird tingling feeling, and it\u2019s very fleeting, like a split second. And that got me thinking that maybe it\u2019s a nerve issue of some kind. I noticed that when I\u2019d comb out my hair or wash it, sometimes the left side of my head would ache really bad.\n\nI\u2019ve also been wondering whether it could be an issue with my eyes, since it would sometimes be triggered by me blinking, and the bottom lid of my left eye would very rarely twitch during those two weeks. And it\u2019s about time for me to get a new glasses prescription, if that helps. I\u2019ve been subconsciously picking at my scalp because it\u2019s so annoying, and idk if that ended up making it worse.\n\nIt\u2019s been bothering me so bad that it\u2019s difficult to go to sleep or focus on anything anymore, and it\u2019s sometimes the first thing I\u2019m greeted with when I wake up. Some days it\u2019s rare (like every two hours or something. I haven\u2019t exactly been keeping track), others it happens practically every ten minutes, but it\u2019s always there to some extent.\n\nI tried taking off my glasses for a day, closing my eyes and trying to keep calm, and taking ibuprofen, but nothing I seem to do makes this go away. I don\u2019t know whether this is potentially life threatening or if this could be permanent, or if it\u2019s benign or whatever, but either way it\u2019s pissing me off and I just want it to end.\n\nI\u2019ve looooong since gotten past the point of being scared for my life because my hypochondria tends to do that with weird symptoms I\u2019ve never had before.

Went through the antibiotics but still didn't feel right.\n\nI only have one noticeable symptom that has persisted-- pain that I believe to be my kidneys on both sides (my docs keep referring to it as \"flank pain\").  The pain comes and goes.  It feels warm-hot and I feel a spasm sensation.  At its worst I was crying in fetal position for 20 minutes.  Most of the time it's a 1 or a 2 on the pain scale.  It's generally felt on one side more, but the side changes.  \n\nUrologists did CT scans, blood and urine tests, dye tests on my kidneys.

I get tremors, my heart beat gets hard and fast, sometimes my hands and feet will go partially numb, I get a headache, and I feel more hungry than before. My weight, as listed above, has always been low, and my doctors arnt particularly worried about it, since I am a very small person in general. I want to gain weight, though, and ive been trying, but sometimes its hard to get myself to eat because of how bad I will feel afterwards.

I eat around 1200-1800 calories a day, and my meals are generally healthy, whole foods, high protein, etc. I eat three meals a day, usually at the same time each day, and have the occasional snack. This mostly happens after lunch or dinner, and the onset is almost immediate, 5-15 minutes after starting the meal. My heart will begin beating very hard I will feel light headed.

I suspected the meds might have been causing it (or making it worse, since ive had this feeling for much longer) but it seems to make no difference if I take my Adderall or not. Im really not sure what to do about this. Im trying real hard to eat more, but I cant eat much more than I am now without making myself sick.

It was typically the smell of an electrical fire or over heated electrical cord but now has changed to ammonia or something similar. About a month ago I noticed the scent change and started paying attention to where I was smelling it after I was at the park and had an overwhelming ammonia smell hit me. Then again about a week later while at a furniture store. Sometimes that's all I get, like a few minutes ago I smelled really strong ammonia and after 5 seconds it was gone. Now I just have a slight pressure/tingle/ impending shiver feeling and my tongue feels prickly.   \n\n\nLast night I had something that freaked me out which is why I'm here. I was reading my kids a bedtime story and get a sudden strong, like made my nose hurt strong, smell of ammonia. No one else in the room could smell it. It was followed by nausea then I felt like I was going to cry. My head started tingling and I tried to ignore it but I couldn't keep reading, it felt like my brain forgot how to process the words into speech. I closed my eyes until the nausea stopped and 30 seconds later I could read out loud but was messing up words I know I knew. My tongue felt prickly after like I licked a 9v battery.   \n\n\nI've had other instances where I don't have the smell but I'll have the feeling like I need to shiver or I stop being able to focus on anything talk. I know when its happening but cant stop it. I feel like I'm tense which is making my back hurt between my shoulders.   \n\n\nWTF is it? Would OH cause this? \n\n\\*I told my PCP about this but forgot the smell thing, he ran a CDC and tested my Iron because my blood pressure dropped from 115/85 to 90/50 when I stood up. My results came back for the blood work and everything is well within normal, I'm just waiting for him to call me with the results (I looked them up online) so I can ask him if this is the OH or anxiety or what.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

My eyes and the muscles around it felt sore and if I lightly pressed that soreness should intensify (on both eyes, but mostly the left , and pressure and tension throughout my head and a general soreness. When I got off the plane I was fine and slept normally in my own location for two days. Then one day I had chinese food and the tension headache came back and I attributed it to high salt intake since if I tend to take a lot of salt my heart rate speeds a bit and I get tension in my head soemtimes. I also had gas and bloating. That night I had insomnia and ended up not being able to sleep until 5, and only slept until 9 am and couldn't sleep more . I attributed that to the headache and tension issues. The next day I decided I'm not eating any salt and eating light foods and my headaches dissipitated and my heart rate was slower - that was good. But then the insomnia persisted - and  I didn't sleep until 6 am , and woke up at 10 am  the next day and I originallt thought it was my body clock off due to the insomnia caused by salt the night before, and once my body woke up at ten am I could not sleep again at all. Each day this progressively got worse- I cut off all electronics 3 hours before bed, meditated ,read under candlight to avoid artificial light, drank hot milk and I could not sleep, If I laid down I'd get an extremely light sleep and that was it- where I was still aware of my surrounding. For some reason when the sun rose I suddenly felt sleepy , and once again I was asleep from 5-10 am and had REM sleep because I remembered my dreams. Each day this progressively got worse- the window of the morning hours where i was able to sleep for shorter, and last night I pulled an all nighter. My shot term memory is like really bad now and I feel sick. But I can't feel sleepy, my brain is hyperalert. What even is this I've never had this in my life - insomnia that persists this long. I've been up for nearly 35 hours with the day before that getting two hours of sleep so that doesn't count - yet I simply can't feel sleepy. \n\nI want to add that soemtiems at night I get the same soreness in my head but especially on the eyes instead of my eyes feeling tired and sleepy. \n\nI have an appointment with my physician today.

It doesn't really hurt if I leave it in a resting position like laying/sitting down, but if I try to put weight on it to walk around it really hurts so I either have to slowly walk around the house or kind of skip on one leg to get to places. It also hurts if I try to lift it off the the ground or try to hover it a couple inches off the ground. It also feels like the nerves in that area are constantly twitching although it doesn't cause any pain.\n\nThe pain usually persists till the next morning but it is not as bad as the night before. One other thing I have noticed is that the pain nullifies greatly if I choose to walk around a bit. (ie around the block). I don't feel the pain throughout the day, unless I am coming back from my lunch break, which I usually sit down for about 50 mins. That pain usually isn't as strong as after work and it goes away once I get back to work.\n\nThis only occurs in my left foot.

However, it has been a while since I used the machine. Also recently, for whatever reason, certain doctors believe that I suffer from severe *anxiety*. In addition, for over a decade now since 2008 (probably 2009) I dealt (still deal) with *phlegm*.\n\n**Family Medical History**: Recently my grandmother passed away from \\*cancer--*she was hospitalized late July of 2018 and passed in October of 2018*\\--\\*while she also suffered from *diabetes* and was a *hypochondriac*. My grandfather also died from cancer a couple weeks after she passed. Also, a lot of my relatives suffer from mental illnesses like *schizophrenia* or *bipolar disorder*.\n\n**All my symptoms**: Weight loss, loss of appetite, discomfort and pressure all over my body like if I'm sitting down in a certain position, feeling tipsy, chest pain, difficulty breathing, vision problems--seeing things that aren't there like flashes or spots of blue and seeing floating stars in the sky or black strings (?) and eye twitching, bowel movement lacking (this one started around the same time I stopped eating for prolonged periods of time), peeing frequently (I drink roughly 3 or 4 bottles of Arrowhead 1 QT), abdominal pain (? kind of, more like discomfort), blood pressure might be dropping or raising (?), headache (currently), phlegm, sometimes I feel detached from what I'm doing and feel confused or scared, sudden jolts like I get up from laying down and it feels like I'm having a heart attack, sometimes when I stand up it feels like I'll pass out.\n\n**Context**: I'm a 20 year old male, about to turn 21 next month, Hispanic. I weigh about... maybe 145, that was my last measurement less than two weeks ago. I started working out last August (around the same time I noticed changes), running four days out of the week, going to the gym three days out of the week, for about 5 months. In that period, I lost about 10-15 pounds, going from 180 to 170. Ever since then my diet and exercise has been non-existent.\n\nLast night and the previous night, I suffered either a near heart attack or just an anxiety episode. It felt like every time I tried to fall asleep, my body would jolt back up because my breathing grew difficult and I couldn't feel my heart beat. I was close, less than a second away, from getting up and rushing to the hospital. But it went away and I don't want to experience that again. I'm at the point right now where it's just becoming a burden, where I feel like a burden and that all I want to do is sleep away my life.\n\nIt doesn't feel like what's causing this is anxiety or depression or even ocd. I'm certain, beyond positive, that what I have is *hypertension*\\--low and high blood pressure, *GERD* or *crohn's disease*, definitely something related to my stomach, *nerve damage*, *heart disease*, *IBS* and most likely *diabetes*.\n\nA couple of doctors and nurses claimed that my livers or kidneys were functioning normal when I did various urine tests, but if I pee frequently then it really doesn't add up. Same thing for the high/low blood pressure and *heart disease*, a nurse at the USC laughed when I mentioned it saying how I was too young and that my bp spiked due to stress and me panicking--which doesn't make sense. And my old doctor, before I switched, said that what I have or could have is *GERD* or *acid reflux*, while they never confirmed it, \"anyone can get it\" that's what my old doctor said. Plus they gave me some medicine for that, even though it didn't do anything for me. And my new doctor keeps believing anxiety is the major factor for my sudden decline in health, which ignores how I feel and all the underlying diseases. Besides having low vitamin D--which is known to be linked to various illnesses like *cancers* and *heart defects* and *diabetes*, no one seems to believe me.\n\nTomorrow I have a followup with my primary doctor because I missed last weeks, and I want to request further tests. An endoscopy for my stomach, a MRI scan because I had way too many x-rays done on me so I don't need any more radiation, my request for a cardiologist went through so I have it next month, more blood tests and a test to see if my kidneys or livers are working.\n\nMy question splits into two. First one: How do I convince my doctor to order more tests? Second one: Should I spend the night at the hospital, just in case I suffer a stroke or a heart attack?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

A couple of the most consistent things ive found are: Acid Reflux (GERD), Stomach Ulcers, or Aerophagia. I went to the doctor yesterday and she said that she thinks that it is Acid Reflux but im not convinced because besides that first day i havent really experienced much of anything other than what feels like a gas issue. No heartburn, no chest pains for the most part, no bile regurgitation for the most part and the fact that is all day every day pretty much since i discovered this. Another thing is not only am i burping but im also farting a bunch and i feel some type of relief from that. That doesnt sound like acid reflux to me. the fact that i am burping and farting extremely excessively after eating almost nothing all day to prevent my symptoms from being worse than they already are, leads me to believe that it's some major gas problem of some sort. My doctor prescribed some sort of medicine for Acid Reflux, Gastritus, and conditions alike and told me to use for 2 weeks and if it doesnt seem to work go back to her. but honestly its hard for me to go through this for another day because im left feeling so uncomfortable all day long from what feels like horrible gas build up. Im started to get really worried and just want to know what's wrong with me. Im considering going to the ER tonight if i feel remotely similar to how i felt last night. The feeling i described earlier as feeling like i was about to explode from bloatedness . I would really appreciate any tips or suggestions anybody has for me on what this could be or what course of action i should be taking to get this to stop. im desperate and really need help... Thanks.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

What do?", "author": "surb2020", "self_text": "whats up reddit?  Hopefully you can help me with some medical troubles I\u2019ve been experiencing the past few months.Male, 29 history of prehypertension and chronic asthma / sinusitis, about 20 lbs overweight but overall in OK shape, currently take losaratan with hctz, advair, zyrtec, flonase.  First started late April, I was on vacation with my wife and kids and we were hanging out at the pool.  Just had not a not so great dinner of cheeseburger and onion rings with alcohol and suddenly feel like I am going to faint, I go to sit down by my wife on the side of the pool.  When i sit down my heart goes into arrithmyia and starts beating super fast, I grab her hand and put it on my chest because I\u2019m freaking out and feel like I can\u2019t talk.  Her, being a nurse, tells me to grab the chair arms and bear down, which I do and my heart slows down.  Rest of the night I feel pretty anxiou/shaky becauxe I\u2019m thinking I had a heart attack or something, next morning I go on a 4 mile jog (about my normal run) and everything is OK and overall that day I am OK except for just feeling overall fatigued and light headed and still anxious from what happened.  The following day (2 days removed from episode) we are back home and I go to my GP who does an EKG and blood test, says everything looks OK.  Hooks me up to a 24 hour heart monitor, refers me to cardiologist.\n\nCardiologist puts me through a stress test, pass with flying colors.  They tell me body and heart are in great shape, lose 20 and see you in a year.  Slightly elevated BP during the stress test, not uncommon since I had been under a lot of stress and anxiety.  Still feeling fatigued/light headed on and off pretty much everyday, back to GP.  She says I have fluid in my ears and tells me I have been having vertigo, that is why I am light headed and fatigued and at the beach I probably had a panic attack when I was feeling dizzy for the first time.  Sure, makes sense.  On to the ENT.\n\nENT I have been seeing for about 6 years does an ear pressure test and tells me I have sinus polyps all up in my nasal cavity and have fluid in my ears, advises surgery to remove and we will do tubes in my ears at the same time to get things moving.  12 day run of steroids and antibiotics in the meantime, then another 12 day run to start 3 days before surgery.  At this point it is the first week of June, my surgery is scheduled the first week of August.  I take the summer off with my kids (as I had planned since before I got sick) so I am staying home with my kids and working from home and I just feel awful on a day to day basis pretty much all of June-July, fatigue and light headedness still.  \n\nAbout two weeks before my surgery I start feeling tingling in my hands and feet, on and off.  Sometimes it is not there at all, sometimes it just feels like a prick, sometimes I feel it from my toes all the way up to my knees, from my fingers up past my elbows and even kind of in my teeth/face.  I call ENT and ask if this is possibly related to polyps, he says no so I follow up with GP.  She says sounds like diabetes, does blood test which comes back normal.  I check my sugars, fasting and after meals, for 4 days and everything is normal.  I figure it might just be anxiety, as I\u2019m feeling awful everyday and kind of waiting for my sinus surgery to happen.  I stop going to the gym at this point, feel like I am not sleeping at night, just overall not feeling good.\n\nFirst week of August, finally have surgery.  ENT does not do tubes because he says the steroids have cleared the fluid, and tubes are easy to do in-office later if I need them.  Surgery goes fine, I feel extra fatigued for a week and half I assume because of anesthesia, nasal passageways are clear.  2 weeks ago, kids go back to school and I start working in an office, I catch a cold and have nasal congestion and mucus, on top of surgery drainage and overall fatigue/lightheadness that supposedly surgery was going to fix.  Still experiencing tingling in hands and feet, not everyday but several times a week.\n\nBegin to self diagnose to get over exhaustion and tingling, thinking it might be losartan hctz side effect.  I have been on the med for 6 years at this point.  Call my GP, she gives me amlodapine and says take that and half a losartan, I also start going back to the gym at this point.  Overall feeling a little better, still suffering from random fatigue, light headedness and tingling.  Kind of feel like I get hit by a bus randomly, and then it goes away out of nowhere.  I am functional at my new job, which was my biggest concern going back to work.\n\nI went to the ENT for post-op last week with my cold, and I even tell him I have a cold.  He takes a look at my sinuses and sucks a ton of junk out, then says I am having congestion again.  He wants me to start on a daily steroid rinse (which I still have not received in the mail) and a 6 week run of steroids, which I have not filled yet because it seems excessive and I hate being on steroids.  6 weeks would be the longest I have ever taken them before.  I\u2019m debating starting them when I get the steroid rinse and maybe trying a 2 week run to see how I feel...  Over the weekend and into yesterday and today my nose passageways feel pretty clear, right nostril is a little constricted but honestly has always felt like that my entire life.  Definitely have fluid/pressure back in my ears.\n\nJust trying to figure out what I need to do to get myself to feeling OK on a regular basis.  IMO the lightheadedness, fatigue and tingling did not go away even when I was on steroids so I\u2019m wondering if they are even sinus related at all at this point.  I wish the doctor would have put my tubes in so that at least I could cross that off the list of culprits.  I have had sinus issues my entire life, this sinus surgery a few weeks ago was my 4th since I was 16.  This is the longest I have gone since high school, my last surgery was 2012.  I\u2019ve never had symptoms of vertigo and tingling related to sinuses in the past, where should I be looking next?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Essentially, he feels his life has been \"too perfect\"-- that he does not deserve what he has. This creates genuine anger for him. He's very pro-conflict and adversarial. He feels as though there is this wall built up of this anger and resentment that he can't get over. There's always a response that he *wants* to say which is polite, supportive and loving.

TL;DR on the bottom.\n\nI am a 23 year old female with no medical history of any serious illness. I have also been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and panic attacks for the past six years but haven't been placed on any medication and only go to a therapist 2-3 times a month.\n\nIn the last few years I have been experiencing nausea every morning. Sometimes mild but sometimes it comes in bad spells. Going to classes at my university is the hardest thing because I'd had to run to the bathroom in horrible pain and feel like I am going to pass out only to be fine in few minutes.\n\nI try to eat and drink every morning as I was told but eating only makes this worse. My blood pressure during the day is 90/60 and no matter how much water and/or salt I take it stays this way until 3PM. My normal blood pressure is like 110/80 I generally don't go higher than that.\n\nAlso I get these spells of fatigue where I can barely stay awake on class even with 8 hours of sleep or I feel like there's a bowling ball in my head that's weighing me down in place whenever I try to move my head or body. \n\nThese events made my anxiety worse and I began skipping classes and failed quite a few because I am afraid these symptoms will come or that I will faint. I opted out of vacation with my friends and spent my whole summer indoors because I am so afraid of being nauseous again. I spent the last few years running to doctors and everything always came back normal, bloodwork, hormone levels, thyroid. All doctors say \"It's stress\" but no one gave me any solution. I've tried taking vitamins, other expensive over the counter \"medicine\" but nothing helps.\n\nThe only thing I ended up learning is that these things don't happen if I wake up after 12PM and don't eat until 6PM. So I started going to bed at 5AM and sleeping till 1 or 2PM just to avoid the scary symptom period. In fact somehow I am perfectly fine at night.

I   notice when I go down stairs my foot always has to go to the right and  point at like 3 o'clock instead of both my feet facing at 12 o'clock,   otherwise my knee hurts and I don't feel steady on my legs.\n3. There   seems to be a shooting pain that goes from my hip to my upper right of   my leg depending on how I move it around, I feel like I need to  stretch  out my leg or have it manipulated in a way that will pop it  back in  place.\n4. I frequently end up with a pain in my lower right back.\n\nA few other random notes that may or may not be related to this...\n\n1. I   was diagnosed with patellafemorral syndrome about 10 years ago, so my   knee pain may either be related to that instead of whatever is  happening  with my hip.\n2. I   do sleep on my right side of my body sideways, I've tried a knee  pillow  but I have a very hard time sitting still in my sleep and I  frequently  toss and turn.\n3. I'm about 200lbs, and I have fallen a few times in icy conditions and various other incidents from just being a clutz.\n4. When   I was little my Mom was told by a doctor told me there was something   wrong with my pelvis and that if I had been born a girl instead I'd   probably need leg braces or something like that. My Mom can't remember   exactly what he said, since it's been 40 years since I was born and   maybe like 35 years since I got looked at because apparently I fell a   LOT as a toddler so she had my examined.\n\nThanks   guys!

My eyes were red, there was a lot of discharge and itchiness. I went to the eye doctor immediately and was prescribed prednisone eye drops which helped my eyes return to normal for a few weeks.\n\nMy eye doctor thought it was some kind of allergy.\n\nThis happened about 3 more times until until late January/early February 2019.\n\nThe 4th time these symptoms emerged, I realized a new symptom was appearing. The back of my mouth had these small sores/ulcers that seemed to appear out of no where and the pain was searing. I couldn't focus on my work and in a few short hours they had developed inside my entire mouth.\n\nI left work early to see my dentist thinking it was something related to that perhaps an infection or something.\n\nHe tells me to brush my teeth more often and do saltwater rinses and that it's just due to poor hygiene. (I do not floss often)\n\nI take him for his word. He tells me my lips are bleeding gives me a tissue and I head out of the dentist office. When I get back home(I walk everywhere) and look in the mirror it looks like my lips are melting off. This raises my concern even more and I  immediately head to a walk in clinic where a doctor tells me I've gotten mucositis.\n\nThis is something patients receiving chemotherapy get, at this point I have no idea how I got it. She prescribes me some lidocaine rinse and different eye drops to help with the pain and keep the symptoms as bay. She tells me not to go to work for the next 3-4 days and writes me a note.\n\nMy symptoms continue to worsen and I end up going to the hospital where I get admitted while doctors try to figure out what's wrong with me. I was in the worst pain of my life, all the inside of my mouth was sloughing off  and my eyes were swollen and gooey beyond belief.\n\nGI &amp; dermatology run tests and small procedures but absolutely cannot figure out what is causing my symptoms. Eventually dermatology believes it was mycoplasma pneumoniae induced mucositis but have no idea how it happened.\n\nThey said my body had some kind of reaction.\n\nI get discharged from the hospital and am on sick leave from work for about a month(i work in a nursing home and my mouth was an open wound so they advised I stayed out of work to heal), I saw the doctors once a week to monitor my recovery for about 4 weeks and slowly over time everything went back to normal.\n\nWell, about 2 weeks ago, my eyes became swollen, itchy and began producing discharge again, and since about a week ago 2 sores have developed in my mouth that are very painful.\n\nIt's a lot more mild than what happened last time but it's the exact same thing, I have seen my primary care doctor last week but she has no idea what this could be and is monitoring how this progresses.\n\nThankfully this is nowhere near as bad as the last time, in just a few days my mouth was basically melting away and it's been two weeks this time around and it's made very little progress. I do not want to downplay it though, this is serious and I want to know what this may be or what direction I need to go in to find out what may be causing this response or if it's a condition.\n\nThe one thing I can think of is...\n\nI was homeless about 2 years ago, I was able to get on my feet and rent a basement now. I am in the process of building a business and my rent is cheap which helps me fund my business however there is an abnormal amount of mold in this basement and I am beginning to wonder if this could be causing all of this.\n\nWhen I say abnormal amount of mold, I cannot even store non-perishable items, in 24-48 hours bread would have mold growing on it, same with opened jars of peanut butter or super marker rotisserie chicken.\n\nOther than that I have no idea what could possible cause my body to respond this way twice when I have never had this type of problem before.\n\nAs far as past medical history I have had a diagnoses of lyme and mono over a decade ago, and currently have ulcerative colitis. I'm pretty healthy all things considered. I wonder if there is a correlation between this and my colitis as well.\n\nI look forward to your responses and know that this will be resolved.\n\nYour help is greatly appreciated.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

There were no symptoms, other than a headache for two days or so, but we didn't make much of it since GF has had periodic migraines for all of her life.\n\nWe did bloodwork test two days ago.\n\nBorrelia burgdorferi IgM tested 18.2 AU/mL (indicated norm is &lt;18, so just slightly more) and IgG tested 80 AU/mL (indicated norm is &lt;10, so eight times the norm).\n\nNurse of Doctor 1 told that it looks like GF's immune system beat the disease, which at the time sounded weird, because I've never heard of someone beating Lyme disease on his own. I thought you mostly needed antibiotic intervention to cure it. She said that IgM relates to the current disease activity or something and IgG notes of post-disease recovery? I don't know.\n\nAfter GF got to Doctor 1, she said that with such bloodwork results nobody would put my GF on antibiotics and she also thought that GF went through the disease by herself and that since she's had no symptoms, she doesn't think we should use antibiotics. GF agreed and said that she doesnt quite wish to nuke her immune system with antibiotics.\n\nAll of this didn't sit too well with me, especially knowing how serious Lyme disease can get, how it's hard to treat once it's been there for years, but easy to treat in the early stages, so I asked GF to get a second opinion. Doctor 1 didn't leave me an impression of absolute trust.\n\nDoctor 2 was from an infectology center and he had the opinion that my GF never even had the disease. To my question if a person can beat a Lyme disease on its own he conclusively said \"no way\" and then explained that bloodwork results regarding Lyme disease are highly unreliable and since there were no symptoms, he doubts GF ever had Lyme. He couldn't quite explain in laymans terms why would a bloodwork test still indicate the disease as positive if a person has never had it and he suggested that there is a second type of test that can be done to verify the disease, but it's really expensive and not covered by state healthcare and since GF has had no symptoms, we're thinking if we should drop such money on such test.\n\nCan any doctor here give a third input on Doctor 1 and Doctor 2 thoughts and Lyme disease in general and what we should do?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I get the odd head flush while sitting still. I tried Flonase, Claritin, Benadryl and Sudafed and nothing seems to make a difference at all. I'm tired of feeling so odd all day, every day. I went from 100% healthy to this and want to get it solved. \n\n* Doctor #1 (Kaiser) did chest and sinus X-rays and gave Augmentin for five days. Said X-rays were with \"normal findings\" and the antibiotics did nothing. No changes in condition, went back again. \n* Doctor #2 (Kaiser) heard a murmur in exam so ordered stress test and echocardiogram. Stress was normal, echo showed slight enlargement of the upper chamber but requires \"no further intervention\". So not a cardiac issue (unless a CT scan would show something different?). No changes in condition, emailed doctor:\n* I asked to see an ENT and for a panel of blood/urine tests to rule out anything else, but he seems to be dragging his feet.\n* I am *wide* open to this being some sort of anxiety issue but it really doesn't fit with my situation and what I've been reading. It's constant and I don't have major, debilitating waves or attacks; I have no trouble going out and about. I feel like I have an infection that has moved in and getting comfortable. I need to remove physiological causes from the list before I go down this road. \n* I keep leaning to some lung issue (mold allergy/fungus/virus/other) connected to the sinus thing. Thyroid maybe, although I don't have many of those symptoms. Maybe a reaction to dust from the construction in our backyard (although it's been going on for over a year now). I feel like we're not turning over all the stones, and Kaiser isn't leading the charge.\n* Basically Kaiser is good for cuts and scrapes but you have to fight like hell to get tests and screenings to get to the bottom of stranger illnesses. They just want you in and out and allow weeks and weeks to pass between visits. \n\n***Thanks in advance for any ideas to add to my list.   :)***", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

It started in my hands (both sides, knuckles at the base of fingers), then spread to elbows. Lately, my hands have been less bad and it's more of an issue of my hips (inside/groin area kind of?) and knees. It's worse with being stationary.

My back, hips, and knees hurt so much it's a struggle to do things like clean my bathtub or the floors and I'm only 29! I went to my PCP on Monday after finally reaching a point where I felt like I was struggling. He observed the low-grade fever, with no other symptoms but the joint pain and stiffness. He took some bloodwork, and referred me to a rheumatologist because he wasn't sure what was up.\n\nBut... the bloodwork was normal. He took a CBC, thyroid, chem panel, and CRP/sedimentary rate. He called today to let me know all was normal. So.... should I bother seeing the rheumatologist? If my bloodwork is normal, I feel like I'm wasting people's time. The swelling is pretty mild, but the pain and stiffness to really bother me (I rarely go to the doctor anyway).

Taking gabapentin, bupropion, and many other supplements.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis started back in 2014/15, not entirely sure. I lived in Wyoming at the time, and this is when I first started getting the issue badly. With no prior warning, I would get severe chest pain, it would hurt to breathe, I would become massively fatigued and at this time, only slightly nauseated/not hungry. This would last me days and I would be bedridden. Changing positions from laying to sitting or standing would be *agonizing*. I would be sleeping for upwards to 20 hours a day, maybe getting up to go to the bathroom. After a few days, or even a week or more, I would slowly come back out of the issue and would be fine. I had no idea what this was, STILL don't know and brushed it off as a Histoplasmosis relapse (I contracted it at around 10 years old from bird droppings).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAS the years go by I still have this issue. Moved from Wyoming to Michigan, then to Kentucky, and back up to Ohio. Things didn't start back up until 2016 when I was living in Ohio, when I had two bouts in that year. Largely the same symptoms, nothing really changed, minus gaining weakness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2017 came around, late that year I moved into a new place and my roommates had cats....6 to be exact. And their litter box was in my bathroom. It ALWAYS stank. Something about it made my chest issue go into overdrive. I was down from it for 3 MONTHS. I lost my job because of it. Had to move back with my parents because of it. To this day I feel awful because I promised I would pay rent for my roommates...they were understandably pissed, but there was legit nothing I could do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe rest of 2017-early 2018, I was having a bout every month. My last one was Feb of 18. In that time it kicked it up a notch again and suddenly I was unable to eat or drink, and without medication I would be constantly vomiting. I was seeing the doctor (NP which to this day I'm positive she thinks I was faking it, now I can't trust NPs) once every time I had an issue, not to mention the countless ER visits I was getting from day 1 of this issue. Now, if you know Histoplasmosis, it can typically leave scarring on your chest from the fungal infection. I had several x-rays, MRIs, CT scans and the like, and not once did they notice any scarring. In fact, they couldn't see anything! It was as if it was in my head. I can promise you it was not. There was no change in whether or not I got it if I was stressed or relaxed. It was so sensitive in early 2018 that something as simple as smelling a lotion would set me off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn this time I had blood tests done, and after a while they noticed my Sedimentation rate, C Reactive-protein and Rhumetoid Factor were all high, indicating inflammation and autoimmune issues. Okay, step one right? NO. To this day, we have not pinpointed the exact reason for any of this, minus Fybromyalgia. I was formally diagnosed earlier this year.

I went to see a family doctor and cardiologist in January 2019 and they performed X-rays and EKGs but didn\u2019t find anything and told me everything looked fine.  \n\nI am 22 M, relatively healthy, no major medical history, and exercise about 2-5 times a week depending on schedule.\n\nMy family doctor did see that my blood sugar levels were slightly elevated and liver enzyme test showed my ALT and AST were slightly high and diagnosed me with hyperglycemia.\n\nI have been experiencing a lot of stress from college this past year.  Is there anyway that my constant stress and anxiety can increase glucose levels via Sympathetic Nervous System activation and disrupt heart health?\n\nEdit:  When I\u2019m not stressed, I don\u2019t feel chest tightness.  It doesn\u2019t hurt, it just feels uncomfortable.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Can't find any information on what I could be damaging. This occurred first about a month ago, and second just last night. While trying to make my voice more lethargic sounding I will sometimes feel an incredibly sharp pain at the base of my throat that results in painful coughing, and the next day a metallic taste that I assume to be blood. Additionally I am experiencing slight difficulty swallowing today, which did not happen a month ago when I experienced similar pain. \n\nI'm assuming I tore/strained something in my throat, and I find the blood taste very concerning. Wondering if this is worth getting looked at. Thanks.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Anal Fistula?)", "author": "meaningofthisiswh", "self_text": "\n\n[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/9N58phe.jpg)\n[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/cpVWWqv.jpg)\n\nI'm a 21 year old Male Filipino in the Philippines.\n11 days ago, my butt started at itch and some slight pain. I ignored this thinking that it will go away. A week later (which was 4 days ago) the itching was still there, but then I noticed a slight burning sensation and slight pain from around the top of the my buttcrack up to below. I took a mirror and saw this [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/cpVWWqv.jpg). Also, there was a foul odor coming from this area.\nI looked up what my problem could be. I saw terms like anal abscesses and stuff, and I thought that that's the thing that I have. Then I saw the term \"anal fistula\". So I looked at my anus, and saw this [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/9N58phe.jpg). In addiiton to the itching, it also feel as though my anus is moist.\n\nI'm not so sure what my problems are but currently, I also feel unwell.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}
