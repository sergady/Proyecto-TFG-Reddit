Once I got out I had a burning sensation in my groin and lower abdomen. I put it down to my trousers and belt restricting blood flow. The next day I noticed a strange pulling sensation in my lower abdomen when I walked. It's located on my waist line, about 2 or 3 inches down from my naval and about an inch and a half to the left. No \"pain\" as such or a noticeable lump, but its a skin-crawling pressure or pulling sensation when I walk. It feels like it's moving or pushing against my innards whenever I move my left leg, as if the pressure increases.\n\nI went to an emergency doctor this weekend in a worry that it might be a hernia or worse, but the doctor couldn't feel anything and predictably asked me if I was stressed or anxious lately. Honestly if I am going to be depressed it's because I didn't get to enjoy my time off at Christmas!\n\nWhen I woke up this morning the feeling had gone, only to return after I drove for about an hour and got out of my car.

I saw tried to flush out my ears, then went to a doctor who flushed them out a lot better.  Wax was removed but the ringing got worse to the point where I hear it all the time, and my ears started to hurt.  Poking and aching sensations.   \n\n\nThis was really bothering me and I was taking some melatonin to sleep.  I had this weird flavored kids brand and decided to switch to a different one.  I did not notice that it was sugar free.  I read the ingredients, but sucralose looks a lot like sucrose.  After taking this for a day or two I started getting occular migraines.  45min+ sessions of visible blind spots, rainbow jagged tears in my vision.  On days 3 and 4 of taking it I started getting complete debilitating migraine headaches that would wake me up and last until 2am.  This is the point where I figured out it was the melatonin, and stopped taking it.  No migraines since.  \n\n\nA day or so after that I discovered a can of Easy Off heavy duty oven cleaner leaking under my kitchen sink.  Not sure how long that was happening, but probably for quite a while as I thought I had smelled paint when coming into my house for a week or two prior.  Upon opening the cabinet the smell became very strong.  I aired out my house for 5 days and stayed with my parents.  That didn't get rid of it.  I then removed my kitchen cabinet.  That also didn't work.  I had a local cleaning company bring in one of those machines they use to get rid of the smell after a fire, and run it for a week.  I was not in my house for that week.    \n\n\nAt this point I am still experiencing the ringing in my ears though without the previous pain.  The much more disconcerting issue is my continuing visual oddities.  My night vision (having previously been excellent) is now garbage.  I am seeing many more floaters, and distortions in my vision.  My eyes have more discharge in the morning making things foggy at first.  I am seeing a wobble in my vision if I look very closely at things.  I am also experiencing after images in my vision (illusory palinopsia).  I am much more sensitive to brightness than before.  \n\n\nI have seen an eye doctor who ran many tests on my vision.  Everything shows my eyes to be in great physical condition.  \n\n\nThe visual effects are most apparent in poorly lit spaces and when viewing high resolution computer screens.  I have a VR headset and I see no visual distortion at all in it, I am assuming because it's already fuzzy enough that I can't tell the difference.  In decently lit spaces the distortions are much harder to see, but things often look slightly off in a way I can't really put my finger on.    \n\n\nBecause of the multiple chemical exposures I am not 100% sure what is causing this, and I have no idea at all what if anything I can do about it.  I have considered trying to do a toxin flush as I have read that sucralose does deposit some fat soluble compounds.  \n\n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated. ", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I am also a lot more sensitive to light, and my eyes feel overall sore and tired.\n\n  \n", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

A  week ago, I noticed pain in the top of my left foot, likely after a run with my left shoelaces a bit too tight, before racing the next day ([photo](http://imgur.com/k00H1O8)). I felt this pain at the top of my left arch when I extended my big toe, and I am suspecting the connected extensor tendon.

The pain subsided to negligible amounts and I started running again, but now I feel a \u201ccreaky\u201d vibration throughout the affected region to my toe whenever I extend that toe.

I was a runner at the time and have always eaten healthy and been very active so it was strange that I (15 at the time) was having almost arthritic pain as well as lower back (kidney area) pain. I went to the doctor where they said it sounded like I was describing some sort of autoimmune illness, they ran a number of tests including Lyme and lupus which both came back negative. They ran a urine test as well which showed I had some blood and casts in my urine. They didn\u2019t really explain what the casts were but said they were just something the kidney produces when under stress? Overall they sent me home with a \u201cmaybe it\u2019s early arthritis but let\u2019s keep an eye on it\u201d diagnosis. I over the next several years I saw a few different doctors and each time they gave me some bogus diagnosis that would in no way be associated with my symptoms. I dropped it after about 4 years and just kind of learned to live with the pain. \n\nFast forward to about 3 years ago. I was working in a butcher shop at the time and eating a lot of very delicious meat almost daily. Still working out and being active and eating an overall healthy diet. One day after I had eaten I got a terrible migraine which I\u2019ve never had happen before and and aching pain starting in my back and then running through my body and causing all the joints on my fingers to swell up and turn red. O thought I was just coming down with the flu or something so just rested and then next day felt better but my head was just in such a fog and I couldn\u2019t think straight. This happened about 5-6 times in the next coming month before I figured out that every time I had this reaction it was right after eating red meat. I did a little test and cut red meat out of my diet entirely for a month and overall seemed to be doing better. At the end of the month I ate it again and the same thing happened. \u201cShit\u201d I thought how the hell am I going to survive without red meat?! I was devastated. Things were good for a bit until about a month later pork started causing the same issues. Then chicken. And then, my worst nightmare. Cheese. It\u2019s been about 3 years now and after several failed attempts going to the doctor one finally told me \u201cif it makes you feel sick then don\u2019t eat it\u201d helpful right?

This has been a many-year odyssey, first began having symptoms in 2006:   \n\n\n2006: alternating between constipation &amp; diarrhea after eating, weird allergy-type reactions to sugar: including cakes, cookies, tomato sauce, fruit -- bananas suddenly become the worst culprit and make my lips burn and face get really hot, suddenly become allergic to caffeine and can no longer drink coffee or I puke, also no longer can wear perfumes. Doctor diagnoses me with IBS and wants to put me on meds. Can't explain the sugar thing and tells me to take benadryl?!?! I change my diet completely, cutting out red meat, fried/greasy foods, do various diets, elimination, candida diet, fodmaps, whole30ish. (Find that I feel best on a no sugar/no gluten diet but I give up on that, have tried 5x now.) Things start to get better but even still my period starts to get heavier, way more painful and include rectal pain (like someone sticking a hot poker in me).  \n\n\nI continue as is and just write the sugar thing off as something weird I deal with. I don't cut it out completely, just manage it -- stopping eating something when the reaction is bad or taking a benadryl.  \n\n\nFast forward to 2016: I end up having a uterine fibroid (inside or bulging into my uterus), become severely anemic describe some of the intestinal and rectal pain to my new doc and she says maybe I have endometriosis + fibroid. I have surgery, she removes some tissue from my recto/vaginal area that she suspects is endo but pathology report says it's not, just fibroadipose tissue. She doesn't know why that rectal tissue was there but my rectal pain gets better, periods get better. But from 2015-2016 my diet gets horrible (gained 25lbs that I haven't lost yet) -- I primarily ate burgers and steaks, fries and I ate a lot more food in general because I always felt weak and did not work out at all because I could barely walk down the street without being out of breath. After surgery my period is 100x better but my intestinal system seems worse.  \n\n\n2017: still anemic, but not severe, more like borderline. I keep switching iron supplements because they all seem to make the constipation worse. My primary also puts me on Vitamin D supplementation for 3 months and tells me to stop eating so much carbs (ha!)  \n\n\n2018: Seems like any and everything I eat hurts me. Severely constipated with the occasional bout of diarrhea, the chemical sensitivity has gotten worse and so has the brain fog and lightheadedness -- many times after eating or if I haven't eaten, and I also have joint pain. I also still have twinges of rectal pain, especially when I'm bloated/constipated/ovulating/or have my period. \n\nI decide to finally try to find out what is wrong with me and start with an allergist. She does a full allergy panel which comes back that I'm not allergic to any of the things that cause a reaction. She said whatever is bothering me is not classic IgE -- she says perhaps my hot face and hot mouth are a dental reaction? Also mentions mast cell something or other but says  maybe I should see a GI.   \n\n\nI go see a GI and she puts me on Miralax protocol while we're trying to figure things out. Colonoscopy is completely clear &amp; healthy. CT scan says I have a supraumbilical hernia (which I knew about, happened months after my 2016 surgery) and something called transient intussusception of the small bowel loop. Also took a blood test and follow-up with doctor is coming soon, though she did say she thinks that she thinks that some of my pain is from the hernia. Could my hernia be making the symptoms of what I already have worse? I'm hoping my GI can figure this thing out or point me in the right direction but in the meantime anyone have any ideas?  \n\n\n  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I'm a very energetic person but about 2 years ago my energy took a dip. The first few months i considered my symptoms to be caused by stress/depression but I've experienced both before and this feels very different.  \nAfter almost a year of going through public healthcare and taking tests a doctor came to the conclusion that i needed a tonsillectomy. I got so happy. \"Finally i will start feeling better again\". When they removed my tonsils they said they were 3 times larger than what they usually see. I had a standard recovery and after two weeks i felt better. But then after a month i started feeling worse again, even after everything had healed fully. And I still had problems with my throat, and do to this day.  \n\n\nHere are my symptoms (I have listed everything that could be remotely relevant, even though a lot might not be related)  \n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n* Fatigue:  \nI feel so tired every day no matter how long i sleep. I can go to bed and if i don't set an alarm I will sleep 11 hours and still feel dead. I read somewhere that too much sleep can make you sleepy so I've tried to keep my sleep to 7-9 hours but there is no change. My eyes always feel tired and nothing i have tried help.  \nAgain, i exercise regularly. I'm not over or underweight and I have no vitamin-deficiencies. Exercise helps the fatigue around 40% of the time and gives me more energy and an 'awake feeling' afterwards. but 60% of the time i start feeling sick, dizzy, headache, runny nose.  \n\n* Headache  \nI have a headache probably 70% of the time which usually isn't too bad but can get worse. I don't think i have migraines because the headaches never get as intense as you would expect - it just feels like a 'normal headache' except it almost never goes away - and when it does it always comes back.   \nI have also noticed the last months that i get an aching my in ears as well - like inside. I had a way more intense version of this during my tonsillectomy recovery but it hasn't fully gone away and comes back a few times a month.  \n\n* Sore neck  \nMy neck always hurts - especially right below the back of my skull. If me or my girlfriend massage it it can hurt so fucking much - like a stinging sensation. I don't know if this is because I'm a gamer or because of stress but it feels different. Like I've always had tension in my shoulders from time to time due to gaming and sometimes in my neck but that could always be fixed by stretching/resting/massaging - but not this.  \n\n* Stuffed nose  \nThis was the very first symptom i developed and i presumed it was allergies. It wasn't - i got a test. My nose get's closed up - but not by boogers or whatever you call it - its almost like the walls of my nose swell up inside and make it so there's less space to breathe through - sometimes none at all! I still suspect there is a liquid or something blocking it cause sometimes when i wake up the nostril nearest the floor can be completely closed and the other more open. I got a nosespray that i take twice a day (Mometasone Sandoz) and it has been helping a little, I think - but not much.  \n\n* Throat/voice problems  \nI am a musician who writes and plays songs all the time so this is a big problem for me (so is the stuffed nose). My voice always feels 'sore' and dry. Sometimes it goes away but a lot of the time i feel like the back of my mouth feels irritated and dry. I also still get strange pain in my throat around my adams apple. And both lymph nodes in my throat are swollen all the time for 2 years, especially the left one.  \nI often also have mucus in my throat that i need to cough out.  \n\n* Temperature problems  \nFor the past year whenever I've taken my temperature it's always been below 35.5 Celsius. At first i didn't think about it but it's always like that. One time it even went as low as 34.8 - and i have no idea why. This is indoors, perfectly normal room temperatures. And the times I've taken my temperature have been because i've been feeling 'feverish' in my body. I'm starting to think this might whats causing everything but i don't know.   \nMy body has a really hard time regulating temperature. When i go to bed the parts of me under the blanket are sweaty and warm and everything outside is so cold. It feels like when you have a fever - how your body goes from cold to warm to cold to warm and is always sweating.  \n\n* General discomfort  \nAll the lymph nodes in my body are swollen and sore (at least all the ones ive checked). I have this sick feeling in my body, one i have a hard time describing but i know it's there. It's not quite fever - more like a cold, but different. I have all the above mentioned symptoms on and off all day every day. In the last year I think i've felt 'completely healthy' around 20 days, at the most.   \n\n\nAll of this is really starting to get to me mentally. I've had my second depression for about 9 months now and i feel it is in large part due to my feelings of sickness and how its dragged me down. I can't do as much sport as i used to, not without feeling worse. I can't be energetic or optimistic cause i feel exhausted all the time. And all of this is in a fucking spiral just making me worse. Last few months i've been trying to fight it and just go to the gym and work out and eat as healthy and varied as i can. I do feel better but not cause i feel less sick, just cause of the healthier lifestyle, i think.  \n\n\nI will answer any questions necessary in the comments so ask away. If anyone has any idea what this could be, just shoot - i'll try just about anything right now  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

This went on for quite a while and I didn\u2019t get any sleep that night.\n\nI was wondering if anyone has experienced this before or knows what it could be because this is a first for me, my first thought would be a panic attack but I didn\u2019t seem \u2018panicky\u2019 so much as overwhelmed mentally and confused as to why everything I looked at was vibrating.

The semen from ejaculation is a much lower volume than it used to be and sometimes it is almost clear and a lot more watery than usual.\n* Ejaculation feels weird, like something is blocking most of the semen from coming out. Afterwards for a little bit my penis feels very weird and uncomfortable. The best way I can describe it is by saying that it feels \u201cjammed\u201d.\n* Sometimes it honestly feels like ejaculate is mixed with pee because of how watery it is and how it comes out (feels like spurts of pee rather than spurts of semen)\n* Sometimes after I masturbate I\u2019ll have to spend hours sitting on the toilet because my penis is leaking. I can\u2019t control this leakage and many times I feel like it\u2019s all over so I go to bed but then it will leak again and I\u2019m back on the toilet. I feel like it has something to do with masturbating while still having pee in there that didn\u2019t get out the last time I peed.\n* Sometimes my perineum gets enlarged and it is very noticable and also very uncomfortable. I\u2019ve noticed that it usually starts to \u201cpucker up\u201d around the same time as my penis gets erect although it\u2019s not limited to this circumstance.\n* There\u2019s something that feels like a bunch worms on my left testicle but they don\u2019t cause discomfort.\n\nThis has been going on for years now and I can't even pinpoint exactly when it started anymore. I'm a pretty lazy person and never thought of this to be a huge deal which is why I never did anything about it. It just seemed like a minor inconvenience, but now I'm scared as hell that my dick is losing function and I'm trying to figure out wtfs going on before it's too late.

Shoe and skate fitters say I'm extremely flatfooted, podiatrist looking at the x-rays says my bones when I stand are where they're supposed to be.\n\nFor about five months now, I've been having some slight numbness in the big toe on my right foot. It started out as pain that I felt right in the toe (like next to the nail, on the side away from the next toe) when the foot was very pointed, like if I stretched out in bed, or jumped, but now it's numbness at what Google tells me are the MTP and PIP joints - it can be a little worse or better day to day, but the numbness is also between those joints or can extend beyond closer to the tip of the toe.\n\nI started to wonder if this might not be super-localized to the toe because when there is pressure on nerves in the top of my foot/ankle (from water falling on it in the shower, or my poking it) I can feel it in the toe in a way I can't replicate in my left foot. I'm also noticing, more now, twinges or aches in my ankle when I walk a lot or wear certain shoes. (I haven't done a good experiment as to what about different shoes causes it, but from a small sample size it seems like it's more likely to happen when the shoe is a bit big.)\n\nI don't notice any reduced motion, nor is the numbness obvious unless I touch the toe.\n\nPodiatrist #1, whom I visited before starting to think this could be an ankle thing, figured I'd irritated the nerve in the toe and put a steroid shot into the toe itself, which did nothing. Podiatrist #2 also suggested that I'd irritated the nerve and that the ankle issue was a result of my unconsciously adjusting my gait to compensate for the numbness. He said it could take a while to heal and I should come back in six months if it wasn't better (it's been three months since the visit now).\n\nI iced/elevated the toe, and also iced/elevated the ankle when I started to think it was the ankle, but abandoned this after the problem didn't go away. Should I resume? I've also been wondering if an ankle brace would help, but am reluctant to spend the money if it'd be useless or the wrong kind of brace (or to go to the doctor again just to hear that there's nothing wrong and nothing to be done).\n\nI can post pictures with arrows if it'd help. I'm just very worried - the toe numbness itself isn't really causing problems in my life, but I was already worried that it was a sign of something that could get worse (nerve damage is no joke), and now that I'm seeing problems in my ankle I'm more worried.\n\nThank you reddit!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I know this community is brilliant at giving advice so I would like to ask for some advice.\n\nSince summer, my hair has been falling out in whenever I wash my hair. Even when I lightly rub, hair still falls out. I assumed it was due to the new shampoo I\u2019ve been using but I\u2019ve switched back to my old one and it\u2019s still the same. Yes, understand that this may a hereditary issue, my four uncles have male pattern baldness, however my dad does not; I still believe that the issue isn\u2019t natural.\n\nHere are some of my other symptoms\n\n* Dry skin - I\u2019ve had terrible eczema since birth (lots of lichenification \uf04c )  and I\u2019ve assumed that the dry skin was due to this.  Recently, I have been drinking much more water and reduced how much I scratch my skin but this hasn\u2019t changed anything to do with the dryness\n\n* Very weak bendy nails \u2013 I\u2019ve also noticed my nails become very weak and bendy maybe around the same time I noticed my hair falling out? They are very flexible and can be bent, pushed and peeled off easily. I have shown this to other people and can confirm it is not normal.\n\n* Hard to gain weight \u2013 I do not know my exact weight but I am probably considered underweight. Despite my small size, I\u2019ve always had a huge appetite. No matter how much I\u2019ve tried to gain weight, nothing has been put on. My diet is fairly healthy and consists of rice, veggies and meat.\n\nIn terms of how much I can eat, I\u2019m not too about the calories but as a reference, when I am hungry, I can eat one 1kg of chips in a single sitting with extra sides included. I\u2019ve always assumed this was not normal but accounted this to puberty. (I\u2019m 22 now)\n\n* Trouble sleeping \u2013 Despite being tired, I will have troubles trying to fall asleep. It would often take me around 3 hours from the moment I enter the bed to fall asleep.

I had been practicing handstand push ups for a long time but this time something unexpected happened: while lowering down, my right elbow popped painfully so i stopped the workout. I have done this exercise many times before with proper form so the only explanation i can think of as to why this happened would be the fact that i had been in a high calorie deficit three weeks prior while keeping the same exercise intensity which lead to improper recovery thus the injury( just a guess). For the next month i sometimes experienced a slight sensation of numbness in my little finger from the right hand and painless popping at the elbow whenever i would bend the arm. When i went to the doctor he said i had epycondilitis and a pinched nerve so i started some low level laser therapy. It's been a month since i feel fine without any issue and the treatments did their part but my elbow still pops (no pain, no weird sensation i just hear the pop whenever i bend the arm and that's all).

The last two evenings, I'd had sudden onset of knee pain just below my kneecap, a bit on the medial side. The pain is bad enough to prevent normal walking (i.e. very noticeable limp). Both nights the pain started while simply walking on a flat surface. It is a sharp/burning pain that goes away when sitting. Both nights, after about 60-90 minutes of this, the pain abruptly disappeared. Last night it disappeared after struggling up a couple flights of stairs - by the time I reached the top, it was gone.\n\nSome background: As mentioned, I workout daily - strength training focused at home. About 4 months back I cut out running during a bought of minor sciatica (I worked w/ my doctor and PT on this). I've been considering adding a bit of running back in recently but haven't yet. I do walk briskly about 12 minutes on an incline as part of my wamup and cooldown, and swim once a week. I end up with 12-15k steps most days due to lots of short duration (5-10 minute) walking (getting kids from school, going between buildings at work, etc). Strength-wise, I do a lot of single leg work (single leg RDLs, single leg bulgarian split squats, reverse lunges). \n\nThe onset of the pain the last two nights did not correspond with any workouts. My last leg workout was Sunday morning, and I had to cut it short and keep it light due to family commitments.\n\nThe abrupt coming and going is a bit perplexing to me.

So The last week of November, I got sick with what I assumed a cold. I had a fever, chills, I think a cough, and chest congestion. By Friday I was still feeling bad although chills and fever I believe was gone by like Wednesday. I decided to workout at the gym that afternoon and had a good workout. The following week I was good, still had congestion and a slight cough but went back to my gym routine. I would hit the sauna after workouts too(probably might have been a bad idea now that I think about it). That following Saturday night, I went out and had a couple of beers. However after my last one(3rd) I kinda felt odd, not the typical buzzed feeling. Woke up next morning and I felt congested( never really went away) and forced a coughing fit. I went to work and as the day went on I was feeling like crap and kept getting worse. Got home and got ready for my second job where I felt like shit my whole shift. I was coughing and I assume I got sick. This is where shit hits the fan.\n\nThe next day I wake up and I'm sick again. Fever is back, chills, cough and chest congestion, and dont remember if I other symptoms. I decided that I would take minimal medication as I'd let the fever just run its course to fight off whatever I had but as the days passed I got worse. I stopped sleeping entirely, literally stopped( and still having trouble sleeping which is freaking me out) my fevers would reach 103 and my dumb self still didnt want to take any medication. Wednesday night I gave in and started taking antibiotics but according to my doc who i saw the next day, I messed up because I should have gone earlier and be diagnosed and medicated appropriately. That the medicine I took was ok but I should have doubled my first few dosages which I didn't do. Fuck\nNext day I didnt slewp again and said fuck it I'm going to the hospital where they dx'd me with pneumonia according to xray. It was in lower right lung. Given different antibiotics to go home with and through iv. Cool. Went home and took an hour nap. That night I couldnt sleep again and my body felt like shit and I couldnt breath. So went back to er where they gave me oxygen therapy and decided to admit me but sent me to other hospital.\n\n Didnt sleep again that night. Docs found that some tests were pointing towards ssepsis and that just sent my anxiety through the damn roof. According to them however, I turned out  negative. Next day fever was finally going down without meds and I got, given ok to go home, given last of iv antibiotics that I was getting again, and given one more antibiotic to take home, so at this point I'm taking two for home and was given two through iv. My blood pressure was found to be really high that day though and that night was still high so I took some meds that I used to take( stopped because of lifestyle change which brought down bp) and that night I slept. I woke up 4 hrs later, hacked up a bunch of mucus with blood and then fell asleep again for 2 hours, woke up, then another 2 hours after that.\n\nThat week, I still didnt sleep, I still wasnt really feeling better, went to another er at one point where they found on xray that pneumonia was going away. My heart rate throughout this week was high whenever I stood up too, 120 btw higher if exerting myself(and still does it.)  On Christmas day I went back to er where they though I had blood clot so ct scan was done. No blood clot but pneumonia had apparently spread to both lungs and right lung was worse. Given another antibiotic, levaquin (which apparently ruins peoples lives). At no point did I ever have green mucus come up btw. Cough went away early on too. If I did spit up something it was either pink and bubbly or just white and bubbly. \n\nStill not sleeping at this point  or maybe I was a little or else I wouldnt be alive. Was given ambien which I only took once and didnt really sleep much either. Went back to doc for follow up that Friday where she heard lungs were still not good and gave me Trazodone for sleep. At this point in time, till the 5th is blurry. I remember sleeping on new years eve but after that who knows. On the fifth, I slept, 7 hours. Next day I slept again 7 hours that then it went to 5, to 4, to 6, to 4, 4,( some days where broken sleep too) then none again until I started taking Trazodone again and managed to now get 6 hours of broken sleep. From the beginning of the month till now I assume my pneumonia is gone but at times I still get congestion, short of breath, heart rate still gets high and higher with even just brisk walking for 20 minutes, I assume sleep would  be gone if I wasnt taking meds, o2 sats vary between 95 to 99 but usually stay around 97 or 98 except when active it stays at 95 96 maybe less but little portable contraption I have isnt accurate unless I'm  not moving finger. I'm scared I was misdiagnosed and my heart is the reason for all of this. Is it heart failure? Cancer? Why did my pneumonia get worse? Was it pneumonia and am I just freaking out now?\n\nTl;dr: 25 year old male diagnosed with pneumonia last month but scared it might be something else related to my heart. Have trouble now with sleep and heart rate and breathing.

All doctor confirmed diagnosis in bold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHad healthy baby at age 20, non-eventful. Then it took 5 years to get pregnant again with multiple miscarriages. Laparoscopic laser treatment of **endometriosis**. Progesterone tablets on the 6th pregnancy (age 25) immediately allowed me to carry.  Developed **symphysis pubis diastasis** at month 5. 2.5cm pre-birth, 3.5 1 month post, PT+binders resolved issues. Otherwise, uneventful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAge 23, had lots of bowel issues. Seemingly random diarrhea, investigated - results \"off\", but no answer. Colonoscopy revealed minor inflammation, nothing else. Diagnosis? \"No idea, just manage it with Imodium.\" Bowel issues continue today. Found mild issues with heartburn - prescribed Aciphex for 4 months. **Tooth enamel begins to deteriorate** rapidly, supernumerary tooth found about 6 months post-wisdom removal. Also found out that two of my teeth are baby teeth, there were no adult teeth behind them. (All 4 of my boys also have it, the twins are mirror, so their missing teeth are opposing.) In other words, **both hypodontia and anodontia**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAge 24, high WBC - 14k, 16k, 15k. Began getting **migraines**, told to begin Excedrin migraine as needed. Lethargy written off due to pregnancy issues, general malaise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAge 25, had aforementioned baby. Took 8 months to fully walk again. Treatment of PT + Norco 10-750 (at the time, legal acetaminophen dosage). Had and continue to have **paradoxical opiate effect**. I am not only pain free, I'm energetic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAge 26, inpatient, high WBC - 26k. NO OTHER SYMPTOMS. Kept 3 days and blasted with IV antibiotics. Migraines increasing in frequency. **Shoulder muscle randomly tears**. No trauma.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAge 26, on depo to manage endometriosis, no other hormone meds - I get pregnant.  With identical twins. Progesterone started immediately. I also begin sleeping with ankles tied together to prevent SPD recurrence. Uneventful until week 22.  Twins have stage 3 twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (**TTTS)**. (While I realize this is likely unrelated, I want to be fully complete in all complications and meds given for it.) Went in to labor night before surgery measuring 42 weeks, had mag bag. Laser ablation, 2 liters fluid removed, babies survive surgery. Begin steroid shots as no one had ever made it full term with my condition. Carried to 37 weeks, went into labor the day of induction. Mild SPD. Uneventful labor and delivery. 5 month recovery for SPD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAge 27, migraines increase in intensity and duration. Norco 10-325 prescribed for breakthrough migraines. **Vit D deficiency** discovered. OTC prescribed. Moles begin sprouting like weeds across face and neck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAge 28, begin developing \"locking\" ankle once a month or so. Told I'm too young to have issues, probably related to bedrest from pregnancies and my weight. Lethargy increases. Teeth begin cracking. Struggle to get to sleep. 36 hour days start. Prescribed Ambien (which continues today, same 10mg dose) and sleep study with latency finds \"**abnormality in sleep pattern but no idea why**\". Doc felt if Ambien is treating it, we could stop there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAge 29, endometriosis gets severe enough to require partial **hysterectomy (ovaries intact)**. **B12 deficiency** discovered later in year. OTC prescribed. **Back pain** begins. First laser ablation of nerves in lower back. Helps greatly. Norco for breakthrough.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAge 30, diagnosed **anxiety and depression**. Buspar and Lexapro prescribed. Lethargy doesn't change. Bruising seems to get easier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAge 31, **ADHD**. Due to Norco prescription, I eschew Ritalin and go with Strattera - non-stim treatment, trying to minimize interacting effects of meds. Felt no symptoms, but PCP heard some lung funkiness and ordered a CT. Lung CT reveals **pneumonia and partially collapsed lower left lung. Levaquin** prescribed\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAge 32, both **B12 and Vit D more deficient**. B12 shots for 4 weeks. Vit D RX of 50k once a week for 6 weeks. I begin to hate food. Laser ablation on back again, after it gave out bending over to pick up a cake out of bottom fridge shelf. Food intake reduced to twice a day. Mild itchy, very very light red, very very tiny bumps, rash begins on back. Moles continue to increase across shoulders and back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAge 33, my mid-range vocals begin to disappear. Raspy, scratchy. I attribute to smoking, but it seemed odd I'd keep soprano and tenor notes, but lose alto. Ankle begins swelling, locking more often. Another ablation on lower back. Food intake once a day, but still no weight loss. Major dental surgery, 2nd molars removed. Again ask two docs (back and PCP) about ankle, told I'm \"too young to have major problems\". **Rash** gets treatment with Voltaren. Improves some, but it still comes back in waves today. **Migraines** get so severe that I'm down every week, and a few times a month, lasting 2-3 days. Prescribed **Amitriptilyn**. This med has worked well for a few years, increased dose 6 months ago. Working well again. Dropped Lexapro since Amitriptilyn is another anti-depressant. Maybe 2-3 times a month I add on Excedrin. Developed **prism** in eyesight. Eyes begin to jump like I'm being shaken if I try to focus for more than a few minutes on a close project, like knitting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAge 34, begin falling when ankle completely gives out. Ask back doc if my gait is a problem. Insists it's not. I demand an MRI anyway. **Osteochondritis Dissecans** found.  Osteochondral Allograft Transplantation (OATs) done using cartilage from side of talus. Denovo denied by insurance. After 4 months, I drop 40 lbs in next 4 months, while on limited walking ability due to the OATs surgery. Same eating patterns as before, once a day.  Weight loss stops. Lethargy increases. Bruising seems easier, but also sticks around longer. (Example, today, I have a bruise from hitting my leg on Christmas Eve. It's still purple and only now just started yellowing.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooked into surrogacy for a girl. Labs and exam reveal I'm near menopause, I've only a few follicles left. Doc notes that even with my medical history and hysterectomy, it's still very early to be getting these results. While I should have entered earlier in general, less than 5 years post-op hysterectomy shouldn't have nosedived so fast. Surrogacy ruled out as they aren't able to harvest eggs. Moles checked by dermatologist, two biopsied after removal from face due to location blocking peripheral vision, determined none of concern, despite increasing in size and frequency.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Age 35 (currently)***, visit ENT as my right ear begins to block completely like swimmer's ear, while being nowhere near water. ENT does scope as well as vacuum right ear which was blocked by wax (I do not use Q-tips). Scope reveals damaged vocal chords due to **laryngopharyngeal reflux**. Never felt the heartburn feeling of reflux but clearly did damage. Given two months treatment on pantoprazole with continued OTC Prilosec for 2 more months. ENT believes ear problems are **TMJ** associated with the missing molars.\n\nOATs fix begins failing in the last month. Ankle swelling is beginning again, as well as pain. Mild, very sparse locking. Beginning pain in hips, right wrist joints. Diarrhea is pretty much ALL my bowel movements now - though the texture and... err... \"explosiveness\" vary - about once a month, I'm wakened in the night due to it. The last few weeks, I've gotten morning nausea. Happens upon waking, disappears 60-90 minutes later and I'm fine. Last 3 days, clear mucus goes with diarrhea, usually a \"sputter\" when I'd only intended to urinate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the last 2 months or so, I don't even want to drink anything. I don't get nauseated or gag reflex issues from intake, I just really, really don't want anything. Yet, I still continue to maintain at 200lbs, even with mild exercise added in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI continue to hear from various docs and PCP that I'm \"too young\" to have any real big problems, so \"let's just wait and see if it resolves\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Current symptoms: diarrhea, nausea, migraines, restlessness, lethargy, joint pain, joint failure, back pain, insomnia, thin nails, jumping eyes, continued tooth degradation, vitamin deficiency, hormone deficiency, random shortness of breath, heart skips a beat once or twice a week while resting, force feeding and drinking, consistently varying - but always high - WBC, right ear pain and blocked sound.**\n\nMy FitBit tells me that my resting heart rate is also on the increase. For the month of December, it went up to 92, from a low of 74 in July, increasing by several over each following month. Not sure on the medical reliability there but thought I'd mention it.

Mono ?", "author": "Sateralus", "self_text": "Ive tried writing this many many times but im not the best at explaining things so im gonna try my best. Im a 20yo kid just tryna figure out what's wrong with me because this is absolutely taking over every aspect of my life and its extremely depressing. August 2017, is when this all started. I was working my last shift at my job, and all of a sudden I got hot with this wave of exhaustion, and heat flashes. I went home and went straight to bed. A month later after a blood test, I find out I have mononucleosis. For basically 2 months after that, I was bed ridden and had no energy to do anything. Now this is where things get confusing. A follow up blood test revealed that the virus was no longer active in my body, but I still felt terrible. My issue is I will go to sleep, sleep a good amount of hours, but still wake up exhausted. And on top of that i look terrible. Pale, baggy eyes, dark circles, just not healthy like I used to. I started noticing during the day i would breathe through my mouth, which i never used to do. The only reason that would happen is if your nose was congested, and it was, all the damn time. After going to an ENT doctor, she told me I had a deviated septum, mild one, but it was there. And that it could be contributing to some sort of sleep apnea. But it never caused me issues in the past so it wouldn't make sense for it to decide to start acting up now. So I had a septoplasty done to correct it, thought I felt better but gradually started feeling worse again. A little more thinking and investigating, I noticed my tonsils were massive and had little white dots in them. I had tonsillitis. I was so ecstatic to have finally have found out what was wrong with me. Got my tonsils out, and after one of the most painful recoveries ever, thought I started feeling better. But again, gradually felt worse again. As of recent, I found out I have an ear infection, and that could be contributing to all of this but I doubt it. Im taking antibiotics for it and I just took the last pill, and so far i dont feel any different. I just want my life back. Ive had many blood tests and they come back completely normal every time. Ive had a sleep study done and I dont have sleep apnea either. Tried every supplement you can take, iron, vitamin d3, zinc, nothing worked. Had an allergy test done, absolutely allergic to nothing. This all started when I got mono, so it definitely has something to do with that. And I know many of you are going to say its obviously chronic fatigue syndrome cause that's common after mono. I dont think its that, this feels more sickly and sleep related. Another thing to note too, the only thing that makes me feel a little better are antihistamines. Could it be mouth breathing at night ? I wake up with a dry mouth every morning. I tried a mouth strap and mouth tape and it never works. How come this never affected me in the past pre-mono ? I know something's wrong with me I can feel it. Please someone help me.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

We called them and they told us it is most definitely a bladder infection. I will be picking up antibiotics today. :))\n\nHi, I want to know what could be wrong with me, and debunk or confirm the reason why it has started happening.\n\nJust for some information, i'm a 15 year old female in boarding school. I met my current boyfriend of 4 months here, and life has just been great from the moment i started school. I have very, very rarely wed the bed before. 3-4 years ago was the last time, and that was the basic \"i dreamt i was on the toilet\" stuff. Also, i don't drink alot of water. I always use the toilet just before i go to sleep, so i don't think a full bladder is the problem either.\n\nIn late december 2018, probably around new years, i agreed to show my bf how squirting works, and regrettably, i had a full bladder at the time. I squirted, but with that followed a huge stream of pee. No big, big, big deal, we are very close, it was just an inconvenience i had to clean up after.\n\nThe week I started school after new years it happened again. This time though, it wasn't caused by anything sexual. On one of the first nights of the week, I woke up because I had to turn around, and put my hand on the mattress to do so. There was a big, big puddle under me. I had my period at the time, but that can't have anything to do with it, can it? The weird thing about this one is, that i didn't wake up while i was peeing. I am not a heavy sleeper at all, normally i would wake up in an instant. I have no idea about when i peed the bed, but i woke up at 04:00 am.\n\nAnd, it just happened now. An hour ago, 03:30 am.\nI was dreaming something about a circus, when suddenly i woke up because i was peeing. This time it wasn't alot of pee, and it stopped as soon as i woke up. I had to pee after, so i went to the toilet. That means my whole bladder didn't empty this time.\n\nI will talk with my mother about this in the morning, i definitely need to get this checked with a doctor. I just wanted to know some stuff:\n\nCould i have ruined my bladder by squirting?\n\nI do not feel any pain peeing, daytime nor nighttime. My pee has not changed color or smell either. Could it stille be an infection?\n\nI recently started taking anti-fungi pills for my toes, could the bedwetting be a bieffect of this? I have only taken these for the last 2 months or so.\n\nAs i was dreaming tonight, i was probably in deep sleep. Could i had spasmed my bladder open? People tell me i sleeptalk alot, could the (supposed) spasms be a part of that?\n\nThank you for reading! I hope you can help.\n\nEdited to add medication:\nThe beforementioned fungi pills - about 2 months\nThe birth control pill, not the mini one - about 2 years\nDaily lactic acid bacteria, if i don't take these i get chronic constipation with vomiting - about 1 and a half years.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

My throat itself feels fine, I can breath and eat fine, no issues there. But the left side of my neck feels like it's slightly harder, almost like tension but no pain. Like a pressure. There's no bump, either.\n\nSecond, I have a small lump on my ankle. I've had it looked at by a medical student and he said it could be fungal. No pain, no itching.

I can usually recall context and sometimes I can recall what it was with a moment to think, but I tend to get paranoid over this kind of stuff so I'm curious. \n\nI am setting up a doctor's appointment for a cold that hasn't gone away yet, it's been a couple weeks now. Just a typical runny nose and not really sore sore throat (no cough). The previous symptoms all predate the cold so I believe it's entirely irrelevant. I also have heartburn from time to time and the occasional headache or migraine. I recently had a root canal and filling done on the right back side of my mouth (second and third symptoms above predate this) and around that time I was on 3 different antibiotics for my tooth (penicillin, amoxicillin and a third that I can't recall the name of). A total of 4 courses.\n\nThank you.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Second one had absolutely no idea and sent me on my way. Whenever I input my symptoms into Google or webMD, none of the conditions that come up match what I'm experiencing.\n\nAnywho, so whenever I get into the shower, sometimes, if the water gets to be too hot and/or I stay in the shower too long, the palms of my hands (sometimes soles of my feet, but mostly hands) break out in these unbearably itchy hives. Like, think of the worst mosquito bite you've ever had, but multiply it by a thousand. The only thing I can think about is scratching or finding some way to make it stop. Sometimes I can feel it coming on so I turn the temperature down, and then the hives aren't as bad but they still really itch really bad. Other times it just starts as a slight tingle and then rapidly erupts into the itchy hives and I can't stop it. \n\nI've ruled out soaps and lotions by just standing in the shower at different temperatures (however when I'm not testing temperatures, I regularly use aveeno sensitive skin body wash). \n\nI've also ruled out any kind of fungal infection, as I'm positive it would've impacted my nails at this point since I've experienced this for so long. \n\nThe ONLY, absolute thing stops the itching is immediately switching the water to the coldest it will go, and then submerging my hands/feet until they're numb.

I am a 19 years old, overweight man, and for the past two-or-so years I have had a problem with my legs. The problem only appears when I am walking or running, where both of my legs immediately begin to hurt like a terrible cramp ache in the calf regions. The pain persists for as long as I walk and will sometimes hurt so bad that it forces me to stop. The pain eventually goes away when I stop walking, and starts again when I start walking.\n\nI did some research and the most possible cause seemed to be a disease called Peripheral Arterial Disease where a clot appears in the arteries of the leg and blood circulation is lessened. I noticed that I had every single symptoms of this specific disease. Therefore, for a proper diagnose, I have been to numerous doctors. I've undergone ultrasound tests for veins and arteries, and there was nothing wrong. Bone scans and X-Rays, nothing wrong with the bones either. Apparently both the veins/arteries and the bones are alright. Therefore there was apparently no health issue in the legs.\n\nAnd yet this problem still persists and I am unable to walk long distances due to terrible aching in the calves and having to stop. My legs also feel extremely tight, and the painful part of the leg in specific seems to have little to no hair while the rest of my legs are covered in hair (if that makes any difference in diagnosing).\n\nThe issue has lowered my life quality extremely and I am forced to take multiple cabs and buses in order to arrive at my destinations. Since neither the leg bones nor the veins and arteries seem to have any problems, I am at a loss on what the cause may be and therefore found myself here.

In the past 11 years I've only had sex with one person and I am pretty much positive he was faithful. He and I are and were both working from home and practically married so we spent most of our time together. Still, it's possible he gave it to me from having it beforehand or he could technically have been unfaithful.  \n\n2. I have had several STD tests along the way and all have come up negative but I can't remember if a blood test was included. The reason for not remembering is I've had quite a lot of blood tests for other things too, so it's possible I never got one but also possible I did..  \n\n3. In all of those 11 years, I never had any problems 'down there' until the past 2-3 years after he and I broke up. I have not had sex since we broke up. 2-3 years ago I had ONE quite large (bulbous) painful pimple down there. It was not a blister, did not itch, did not ooze (aside from the moment I popped it), and did not scab. I popped it and it drained instantly. Immediately it did not hurt anymore at all and it healed within a day. I don't know if this could be herpes, but it didn't look like any photo I've seen.  \n\n4. Aside from that, I didn't have any other issues for years until this month. I noticed a (singular, one) tiny crater on my outer labia that itched for about 10 minutes (then not again for hours and only itched once more for a few minutes or so), hurt a bit only after I scratched it, and didn't hurt ever again. It went away in like a day and a half. A month later, a couple nights ago, it came back in the exact same way and spot and symptoms. By 'crater' I mean it's a tiny spot that is concave -- not a blister or bump. Only one, not a cluster.  \n\n5.

I am wondering if anyone else's experience has been similar as all of my doctors have not been able to conclude anything or if anyone has any other thoughts on what this might be. Again, all my ultrasounds and bloodwork came back normal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy absolute main symptom is a very strange pressure/stabbing/aching pain right underneath my belly button that seems to extend to my lower right-ish side when I press on it. I cannot run as I used to because it feelings like something is bouncing around in there. Laying flat on my stomach or flat on my back is uncomfortable as well. It seems to be worse at night.\n\n* In 2018, I got my period 4 times. I am not on birth control and I am not pregnant nor have I ever tried to be.\n   * I at first just attributed this to stress but my last period was in September 2018.\n* In April of 2018, I started waking up bloated every single day! \n   * I used to feel so skinny in the morning but my lower stomach is bloated every time I wake up. My stomach used to be the skinniest part about me with all my weight gain usually going to my thighs.\n* Extreme anxiety and depression unlike ever before starting in June 2018.\n   * I am currently on medication for it now but was just feeling soo unlike myself.\n* Uncontrollable burping/belching. \n   * Took Nexium which helped but I have never before been able to purposely make myself burp and now it is uncontrollable.\n* Cystic acne unlike ever before started this past fall. \n   * I didn't experience acne that bad during puberty or ever in my life.\n   *  Again, not sure if this was a side effect of the anti-depressant and or stress related.\n* I also naturally have somewhat thin hair. But lately it looks like my hair is sooo thin around my hair line and it almost looks like it is receding when I put it in a pony tail. I have not had any hair actually fall out.\n* Besides that, the weight gain! \n   * I have never eaten healthier or as little in my life than I have this past fall due to both stress and insecurity about my stomach bloating but have never weighed more in my life. It is so frustrating.\n   * I usually weigh anywhere between 113-120 pounds. I work out 3-4 times a week and my diet is nearly perfect. I am currently at 125 pounds and cannot seem to lose a single pound.\n\nCan ultrasounds miss things? Has anyone been misdiagnosed before? I have an appointment with my PCP this Friday but am feeling so annoyed that it has gone on this long with no diagnosis. I am hoping someone can tell me whether or not they had any of these symptoms and was later diagnosed with PCOS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you all in advance!!!!!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I am being treated for depression and have taken multiple antidepressants over the past two years. He decided to add another new antidepressant (Sertraline) in addition to the Bupropion and also increase the dose of Agomelatine from 25mg to 50mg in order to help me sleep. Before that day, I had no side-effects from the medication.\n\nIn the morning: After my appointment I got home and took the Bupropion 150mg and Sertraline 50mg around 10am. I noticed a slightly reduced libido during the day, which may have been placebo or caused by the general depression/mood. Apart from that, nothing changed. No nausea or anything, really.\n\nIn the evening: I wanted to go to bed and took my medication (Cetirizine 10mg, Mirtazapine 7.5mg, Agomelatine 50mg) at 21.00.\n\n20 minutes later, my heart rate suddenly jumped to 120+ bpm. I wasn't thinking clearly enough to measure blood pressure. I was in panic. My throat was burning, my lips were burning. I started sweating profusely and had a sudden heat-wave come over me. There was another wave going from the top of my head down my entire body into my feet. It was hot, cold, and burning at the same time. The skin on my arms was burning and itching and I was very nauseous. Even though I have asthma, my throat did not swell or close up, thank god!\n\nThe symptoms appeared suddenly and came on strong, got better for a few minutes, and then started back up in waves. This continued until I was in the emergency room of my local hospital.\n\nThey gave me saline solution IV, I think beta-blockers and some antihistamine medications. I slowly started feeling better and my heart started slowing down. I stayed at the hospital for a night and felt completely free of symptoms in the morning.\n\n**The doctors in the hospital attributed it to an allergic reaction to the Agomelatine**. Strangely it happened after a dose increase and not immediately after starting the medication. Also, Agomelatine is one of the most harmless medications available for depression and most studies call it extremely safe. I immediately stopped taking the Agomelatine. Although, I must admit that they didn't even know the medication I was talking about. I tried to spell them \"Sertraline\" and \"Bupropion\" multiple times and they didn't even know what I was talking about. I highly doubt they would be able to diagnose a serotonin syndrome correctly.\n\nMy psychiatrist assumed a serotonin syndrome because of the Bupropion and Sertraline combination, which happened 12 hours after taking them. I have stopped Bupropion cold-turkey on the 9th of January and did not have any withdrawals. Actually, my mood got way better for a week or so after stopping it.\n\nSo I have two different opinions, from two different doctors. And now, any time I eat or take some medication I get anxious, start sweating, even get nauseous. I know that I am imagining it, but that doesn't make it any less real to me. It is a horrible placebo-effect. That night shook me to my core, I was so afraid.\n\n**My doctor wants me to give Sertraline 50mg another try**, but I am horribly scared every single time I take ANY medication. **Should I give it another try?** When it comes to medical things I trust my psychiatrist. In social things ... let's just say he's of the old school and has zero compassion or understanding. All he hold me that either I try Sertraline or I don't. He believe in the serotonin syndrome, that's it. These are the medications he proposed:\n\n    Morning: Sertraline (50mg)\n    Evening: Cetirizine (10mg), Mirtazapine (15mg)\n\nQuestion: What do you think this was? Was it an **allergic reaction** or a **serotonin syndrome**? Should I take Sertraline again?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I have never had any problems with teeth or any sensitivity (EVER) before. Now I can not regret enough how I miss my old filling which caused me no discomfort at all. I got it replaced early September with a composite - the filling was too high right after I left so I went back to get it fixed. Still not enough, the next day I went back to smooth it down even more. Then it started to feel more natural but when I was biting into this weird paper to identify my high spots on my tooth I noticed horrible pain. My dentist said it's completely normal because he drilled my tooth a bit so I let it be and went home.\n\nNow, this is when things get tricky - I started noticing this extremely uncomfortable \"sensitive\" pain from the nerve of that tooth ONLY when I eat food which is crunchy like tortilla chips, nuts, crunchy flakes etc. It always shot this \"sensitive pain\" from that exact tooth. Now note there were no high points because he checked it and when I bite I felt nothing unusual and no pain.\n\nSo around a month ago I decided to go back to my dentist to look on this tooth and he decided to replace composite with amalgam and I got really upset because that defeats the whole purpose -I suffered for nothing to get back into the filling I did not want on the first place. SO he decided to replace my composite with glass ionomer cement. Now I know this filling does not last that long, especially on my molar but I was happy that I might get rid of this pain so I did not care.\n\nAs days went by I started eating whatever I wanted and today I ate some crunchy flakes with yogurt and guess what.. it shot this sensitive pain again. When I ate the crust on the pizza I felt it again, and again. I am so desperate. I don't understand why it shoots this pain only when eating crunchy things nor what can be solution or cause of this. He saw nothing wrong with the tooth and said the cavity was not deep AT ALL. He got it replaced the first time and it did not help at all again. I went from fully healthy teeth with no sensitivity to this state of when I'm afraid to eat anything on my left side because of the sensitivity and pain.\n\nThank you for any advice", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

It all started February 2018 i was 16 years old and a completely healthy, happy and active teenage girl until i got the flu. That years flu was bad to say the least i knew several people who were in the hospital for it, but it just felt like every other flu to me and so i took 2 days off school and went back ( Even though i still felt sick.) I\u2019m the type of person to always be busy and push myself to hard and never rest. So it started feeling like my flu was going away and i decided to go to my friends house which ended being a huge mistake. We were outside and i got extremely sudden shortness of breath,dizziness and chest pain then had a panic attack until my mom came and got me. I went to an urgent care and they weren\u2019t any help. Struggled hard a couple days before my appointment with my GP where i got diagnosed with pneumonia. Got a strong round of antibiotics and went took an entire month off school because it was so bad, i could barely walk because i was so out of breath. Thankfully some of my teachers were understanding and some weren\u2019t. I finally felt fine until randomly i got extremely dizzy and faint in the middle of class. I asked my teacher if i could go to the restroom and called my mom to pick me up. This dizziness just got worse and worse and once again i was taking more time off school. I had vertigo constantly, i could barely walk without my moms help. It was the worst feeling. Eventually after another month i got diagnosed with Labrynthitis. Which you can get after a viral infection. It made so much sense and i was mad i didn\u2019t get diagnosed sooner. It was fine though because i thought okay well it only goes up from here right? Well no. After this i started to get pain in my pelvis. After a couple days it got worse and started to get flank pain so i took a quick trip to the urgent care and got diagnosed with a kidney infection. The white cell count was off the chart. It was weird to me because i haven\u2019t even gotten a uti since i was maybe 8 years old. This infection was extremely painful and due to a bad fever and i turned out to be allergic to the antibiotics they gave me i ended up in the hospital. They waited for my fever to go down and have me I.V antibiotics. THEN i got strep throat after a week with the kidney infection and ended up in the hospital again because i couldn\u2019t breath or swallow. I also had a massive ulcer in the back of my throat. After ALL of these infections cleared i was okay. Then i developed heart palpitations all of a sudden. I also failed to mention earlier, but since my pneumonia i\u2019ve had a lot of trouble breathing, but when i got my heart palpitations my breathing got much worse. I also got horrible gas in my chest and kinda gross, but i\u2019m burping constantly. I went to my GP for advice and she just wrote me off at first and said it was anxiety. After my angry mother got angry she decided to do \u201csomething.\u201d She gave me a flovent inhaler and flunase and said it would help. It didn\u2019t. This doctor would always flame everything i felt on anxiety and allergies. She even called me crazy when i said i was still having pelvic pain and it takes almost begging to get a referral so needless to say i\u2019ve switched doctors . I ended up going in the hospital again because i got intense pain in my pelvis. I got blood work and a CT scan that showed i had pancreatitis. For the heart palpitations i went to a cardiologist. Everything came clear and i just did a halter monitor, but i don\u2019t think it\u2019s a heart problem. Waiting on tests for my pulmonologist and she does think i have a lung problem, but i do have asthma on top of that. My new  doctor that i went to a couple days ago is now amazing and determined to help me. She\u2019s referred me to a allergist, immunologist, a lengthy panel of blood work to get checked. She said we\u2019ll go from there. So now January 2019 almost a year later i still feel awful. My symptoms include headaches, frequent kidney infections, cloudy urine, still have labrynthitis, but it\u2019s better, extreme shortness of breath(this one is the most disabling, i feel like i\u2019m suffocating from literally walking.), heart palpitations, lung pan, i get every little viral infection literally 6 in 2 months. The gas which my doc thinks is either a ulcer or reflux i\u2019ll find out tomorrow. Horrible fatigue, muscle aches and just this overall feeling of being sick all the time. My known illnesses are labrynthitis, asthma and scoliosis.  I also have anxiety and depression that i\u2019m treating with therapy. I\u2019m so over feeling like this all the time and just want my life back. Sorry if there\u2019s grammar errors or anything i kinda rushed this.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

My mother would scream at me for hours and hit me for getting bad grades, and my father would ignore or justify it. But sometimes it got so bad he had to intervene. My mother is 100% demonic and mentally ill and my dad doesn't want to accept that. Furthermore, awareness of Aspergers symptoms may be making me cherry pick otherwise normal behaviours.\n\nStarting from the very beginning. At 7 I was having difficulties in school and social life so I was taken to a child psychologist who's conclusion was \"these symptoms are characteristic of mild Aspergers\" but didn't concretely diagnose me, but still gave some tips to help me as if I had the condition. (My parents obviously ignored anyone who tried to tell them how to raise their children or treat them better)\n\nI remember little of my early childhood so I'm mostly going off of this report and everyone else's observations. But keep in mind that  some of these observations mostly came from my abusive mother, so who knows how accurate they are.\n\n* Basically, I always chose to isolate myself and play alone or read and had very little interest in other children. When I did have interest apparently I wasn't interested in what others were saying but always what I was saying. Apparently I would also frequently have a mismatch between my facial expression and my words and my expression was always blank.\n* I hated baths and showers and anything to do with water because it just felt so bothersome against my skin. I complained incessantly about my hair tickling me and falling in front of my eyes that my parents let me grow it to put it up.\n* Observations showed I was clueless or indifferent to the unspoken rules of group activity. Plus I had immense difficulty in math and apparently couldn't understand 'abstract concepts' of which the report gave no examples of.\n* I was also incredibly obsessed with animals , read about them and talked about them all the time. My level of English spelling, comprehension and reading was always 3 years ahead of everyone else from the 1st grade, and I could never understand why everyone was so bad at reading. Everyone noted that I was always speaking in a very posh and detailed manner. I imitated a lot of phrases from American cartoons too, so much so that I developed a strong American accent and it's only a little milder these days. (I grew up in Malta with an entirely Maltese family and no Americans in sight). I was also not paying attention in class and day dreamed all day. And my psychologist said these were classic symptom of a 'special interest' common in Aspergers children.\n* Some other things I should perhaps mention is that I was interested in and played action video games since early childhood and loved action movies. The toys I would play with rarely involved barbies and mostly consisted of animals and dinosaurs. I would try to play rough and tumble with other girls sometimes, but obviously most of them didn't like that play style. As a matter of fact one of my favorite activities was to play rough and tumble and sword fights with my grandpa.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMiddle childhood:\n\n* I struggled in all subjects but math especially, mostly because I was day dreaming all day.\n* My social life grew even worse. For some reason as soon as I started the 4th grade everyone hated me and wouldn't want me to hang out with them. For most of the year I acted out by picking physical fights with them because I felt so alone and rejected. Things finally got better when a group decided to forgive me and play with me.\n* Besides that one group that I only hung out with in recess, I had no other friends and I wasn't bothered by that idea. At 12 I developed an extreme anxiety towards people and making friends that never really went away. And from then on I felt very depressed and it never went away. I had one best friend that's still sort of my best friend.\n* I came to know from this best friend that whenever I was absent from school, my classmates and teachers would voice their opinions about me. Which was that they thought I was weird for always staying alone, that they kind of felt sorry for me, and that I probably hat autism.\n\nAdolescence:\n\n* Nothing changed much. In fact I keep saying that many times I feel my mind hasn't grown since 12. I still stayed alone except when hanging out with my best friend. I lost interest in animals and reading and just grew more obsessive with video games to the point where it was distracting me from studying.\n* I talked to councillors on 3 separate occasions about what was going on at home. They didn't help much, one made it worse. I also got to know from my best friend that her personal teacher (and LSA) spent a full 3 years begging the councillors and my parents to get me proper psychological help.\n* Up until I was 14 and a half I did not care about make-up, skirts, or even self grooming. (I cringe when I say this but I seriously didn't shower enough either).\n* The last year of high school I finally made the effort and studied and passed to get into a 6th form.\n* 6th form was hell on my brain, not because of the studying itself. I was very very anxiety-ridden. I had paranoid thoughts, depressive spells that would last for weeks. Since 12 I barely knew what it was like to feel truly happy. I thought of suicide a lot.\n* For the past 3 years weird symptoms have been cropping up. I'm sensitive to the way clothes feel on me and nothing ever seems to feel comfortable on me (I'm only a tiny bit overweight) and I absolutely hate sounds like clanging, banging, alarms and screeching, even distant ones.\n* Towards the end of 6th form my friend who was studying psychology hinted to me that she suspects I might have Aspergers. For a few months she concretely believed it. Then we had a huge fight (not physical, and I was always trying to de-escalate the situation), and her belief that I had Aspergers tripled because according to her Apergers people have difficulty in empathising. In fact she admitted that for the past few years she kept searching the internet for tips on how to deal with difficult Aspies. I mean I do admit I was slow in reciprocating kind gestures, but by this time things were pretty good between us.\n* Then I entered university, and I realised that the only reason I was panicking at my lack of socialisation and friends was because everyone was mocking me for it, and in reality I wanted to stay alone. I had little interest in other people, sure I admired some cool people, and got attracted to some of them, but had no desires to really hang out with them. Besides, for the past few years I've had writing to keep me company.\n* Due to the fallout with my friend, my relationship with a mutual friend strengthened and she became my new best friend. This friend knows 3 people with Aspergers, and when I told her about what the school and my other friend had been thinking of me, she replied that she honestly thought I had Aspergers, just from her instincts and the way I acted. I brought up the Aspergers topic with a university therapist who said that if it's not impairing my ability to function I shouldn't persue a diagnoses.\n* I still have immense difficulty in math. I passed my O-level mostly by memorization and chance. I'm absolutely incapable of working a cash register because I struggle to do even simple additions and subtractions in my head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that brings me to now. I was thinking about the topic a lot since I just got a hold of my psychological report from when I was 7 and realised I was a little abnormal even from early childhood. Obviously I haven't said everything, I'm sure if I had to take a proper Aspergers test the psychologists would inquire way more into the details of my life.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I've done all the usual things to alleviate this such as over the counter medication, increasing water intake, minimising stress, wearing my glasses both more/less often to see any difference and still no change. \nIt is constant in that it's consistently a dull ache at the very least (e.g. if I'm distracted or trying to do something and not focusing on it) to the worse being that my eyes are too sensitive to light that I can only be in a dark room.

I am task oriented and able to accomplish things at work each day in order of importance and also in a timely manner. I also rarely let anything slip through the cracks because of my need to document.\n\nIs this just a form of anxiety? Have I described this in a way that makes sense? If it is something that can be treated and if so what are my options?\n\nI just want to find balance so that I am not in a constant state of high stress (that is mostly self-inflicted).", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Pain is not always felt while doing above activities, and is more likely to happen after eating a large meal, wearing tight pants, or 'sucking in gut'.\n\n-pain occurs for a very brief instance, 1 sec during certain straining of the right chest muscles.

I\u2019m not flat footed, and ran slow miles due to the distance. There was not a particular run that was extensive or heavy- it just sort of happened. I rested for about 2 months, and the first run after the shin splint came right back. 6 months down the road, I was in constant pain even when not running. Sports massage on the lower leg helped a lot and I was able to run for two days before it came back. I stopped running 6 months after that and haven\u2019t run in almost 6 years. I still get searing pain the day after I wear elevated shoes of any kind, and occasionally the tendon just aches sharply for no reason. Yesterday I was on my feet for a while (4 hrs) in some 2inch booties and today I was limping my way around the city in flat shoes because it hurt so badly to walk. I think it might be compartment syndrome, but I have problems with the extensor tendons in my hands as well and it might be an overall tendon issue. I have never had problems with the other leg or carpal tunnel or any other tendon; just the tendons on the back of my hands and the front of my foot and shin on the left leg. Is it worth it to go to a doctor for diagnostics, or will they just advise massage, rest, and NSAIDs and make it a waste of an MRI?
