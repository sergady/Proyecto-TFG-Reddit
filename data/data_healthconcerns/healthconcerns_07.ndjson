I take omeprazole dr daily (for about a month now) to assuage my semi bad acid reflux. The acid reflux was causing a decent amount of irritation to my throat and breathing channels; but these issues have since progressively gotten better. The past few weeks I have started noticing \"divet\" like indentation in the roof of my mouth. After further inspection they appear to be dark in coloration and (these spots specifically) don't seem to hurt/sting. I occasionally have inflammation in the roof of my mouth which I assume is related to the acid reflux. Also worth mentioning; I recently quit vaping and smoking weed after partaking in the habit(s) for around a year. I have a little bit of a problem with health anxiety and was just curious/worried about these specific spots. I plan to see my dentist and my Ent soon and plan to bring this issue up with them as well. Should I be concerned with the dark spots circles in the link above or am I just giving myself health anxiety over nothing?\n\nAny responses appreciated and thank you for taking the time.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I\u2019ve been healthy for most of my life, my bloodwork is usually good aside from chronic mild neutropenia, which isn\u2019t unusual in my family. My iron also tends to be borderline low. I had what seemed like hay fever as a child and I was diagnosed with asthma when I was 6, but I seemed to grow out of it. \n\nIn the fall of 2017 I started developing a pretty nasty cough that would come and go. I had a chest x-ray shortly after the cough started and it was clear. I\u2019ve also started having hot flashes, frequent chills and regular infections, usually in my bladder, kidneys or my throat and sinuses. I get at least one infection requiring treatment with antibiotics almost every month. \n\nThe main issue I struggle with is the cough. It will sometimes improve but then it gets worse again, I assumed it was allergies but I was referred to an allergist who tested for 10 things and said I didn\u2019t have any allergies. She did say I had a lot of inflammation in my sinuses, which is true, I can\u2019t usually breathe through my nose well. I had a lung function test which was normal for my age, although my cough wasn\u2019t too bad when they did the test. \n\nI\u2019ve been tested for HIV and hepatitis, but other than that my doctor won\u2019t do anything to figure it out. My cough is becoming debilitating, I\u2019ve had to leave class because of it regularly, I can\u2019t volunteer when I\u2019m coughing because they worry I could be sick with the flu or something and it makes me hesitant to go outside at all. It improved when I had my steroid inhaler but since I wasn\u2019t allergic to any of the 10 things I was tested for she decided I don\u2019t need it. She doesn\u2019t believe that anything is wrong with me and thinks I\u2019m making it up, which anyone who sees me regularly would find ridiculous. I spend most of my time trying to stop coughing, drinking peppermint tea and using a lot of menthol cough drops can help for a very short time but nothing can stop it. This is the worst it\u2019s ever been and I\u2019m completely miserable. Does anyone know what can cause this in a 22 year old?

My GP did an RA test,(neg) and tested thyroid (no issue) hip and knee MRI (bc I had strains) and wound up sending me to an OD. Osteopathic Dr. At the fist visit the said my ribs, and hip and l5 or something were off, and sorted me back out. They said I was super tight all over. I had ankle weakness and knee instability.  Once they reset some things I did feel better but it never stays.  \n\nI was once misdiagnosed for tendenitus. I was hospitalized about 7 or 8 times in my adult live for strains or sprains that never really happened from anything drastic.  I have always been out of shape and never able to \"keep up\" with others. I just felt lazy.   \n\nNow my OD says I have nerves or muscles that fire off at a more rapid rate then the average person. So simple movement and tasks react as big strenuous things I suppose.  He said my fight or flight reaction is much quicker which keeps me super tense. Anxiety plays part in that which I've always had. I take Prozac now. But you know, I'm pretty anxious anyway. \n\nHe didn't give me a diagnosis, but he did give me muscle relaxers which I have to take nightly. They did say my muscles are much looser, but regardless my pain and aches are still there. So here I am, trying to find \"what's really wrong with me\" my whole life I have said, something wasn't right.\n\nSome random info. I had a bad reaction to trying weed, where it triggered a fight for flight response for DAYS I had to be put on some heavy medication to settle me. It was horrible. I thought I was going to the asylum but eventually it worked out after Prozac and time.  Now I reflect back on it from a year ago, and think it was part of this fight of flight that was in high effect. Seemed like adrianal fatigue.\n\nOk well I'm sure I have more details I am leaving out but I just need to get this out. I've only told my OD about all of this.

Doctors and tests haven't been able to figure out any root causes.", "author": "Killercopperhead", "self_text": "Hey guys. I'm a 21 year old Caucasian male and I've lived in Western Kentucky for the past 15 years. I had Migraines when I was younger, but after some testing found out that I was allergic to casein in cow's milk and that it was triggering the migraines. This was when I was around 12-13. I haven't had a migraine since then (until recently). That was the only medical issue I have had to deal with in the past. For the most part, I've been fairly healthy, with the exception of being a bit underweight and having ADHD (never been medicated for it). I am 5' 7\", and weigh 120 lbs, though since I got sick a few months ago I've been dipping down to 115 lbs if I don't force myself to eat enough. I have been sick for just over 6 months now (I started having symptoms in late January), and overall I am doing a lot better, but I'm still struggling with a lot of symptoms and have not really been able to get any answers from tests or doctors.\n\nRight now I have the following symptoms which range in severity throughout the day:\n\n- Headaches (Tension mostly)\n- Lack of appetite\n- Migraines (every few days, different from the ones I had when I was younger)\n- Head Pressure\n- Paresthesia on my forehead and my tongue and mouth, not very painful, mostly just annoying.\n- Minor Depersonilization/Derealization, no past experience of this and no accompanying anxiety. Comes on rarely now.\n- Very mild visual snow.\n- Difficulty concentrating or thinking clearly at times.\n- Memory problems.\n- Apathy\n- Sometimes body aches and some mild flu-like symptoms. Feels kind of like I'm pretty hungover.\n- Some shivering.\n- Also have noticed that my pupils dilate much more than they used to. No other current eye problems though so its pretty benign.\n\nI also had the following symptoms for the first couple of months when I was sick, including all of the above.\n\n- Severe dpdr that was 24/7 for two months.\n- Slightly more severe visual snow.\n- Anxiety. Mostly health anxiety related to my symptoms and what I could possibly have.\n- Weird brain zaps and odd sensations electric-like sensations in my head (seizures?).\n- Major trouble thinking clearly.\n- Severe apathy and loss of interest in all normal activities.\n- Some depression.\n- Paresthesia on my whole face, sometime very painful.\n- Early on I had major eye problems. Light sensitivity, Itchy eyes. Really bad eye strain. I almost couldn't look at anything any reading anything was almost impossible. Only lasted about 3 weeks.\n\nThe most debilitating symptom was definitely the dpdr (though it is very mild now and I only experience it at most 2-3 hours a day). The only thing that I know of that could have possibly triggered whatever happened is either the flu, which I had for about 4 days before this started happening and was just about recovered from, or maybe lyme disease(?), which I have absolutely no idea if I have but my mother did have it (She was diagnosed when I was 10) and I have been bitten by an absolute crap ton of ticks over that past years (easily several hundred ticks). That being said I have mostly no clue at this point as to what could have caused all this. I had a lot of testing done to rule out things like MS, cancer, etc. and all the tests came back normal.\n\nThe current medications I'm on is Lamotrigine (for the dpdr and visual snow), which has helped immensely with both of those symptoms, and Klonopin, which helped calm my initial anxiety and alleviated some of my symptoms earlier on. I'm currently just over half way off the Klonopin (currently taking about 0.5 mg daily), and I take 200 mg of Lamotrigine a day.\n\nObviously I have continued to talk with doctors and neurologists about this, but so far they have not come up with any root causes for my symptoms. A lot of these symptoms have improved, but I am still dealing with many of them to some degree, enough to cause me lots of issues in everyday activities.

I even have a list of foods I absolutely hate. Sausage, cheesecake, peppers, dark chocolate, cereal, hotdogs, cheese, most meat in general, wasabi, onions, barbecue sauce, milk, greek yogurt, etc. Like I said, I am VERY picky. My Mom bought a lot of organic foods too in my childhood which I absolutely hated. I would often crave things like pop, chips, pretzels, etc because my Mom never bought them.\n\nAnywho since about 1st grade I never ate breakfast as I would never have time and wasn\u2019t too hungry overall. It kinda became a habit but every few weeks I would have breakfast. I also got the habit of not eating lunch at school in 1st grade. Since I was so picky everything tasted bad to me. The bread was tasteless, the PB&amp;amp;amp;J was mushy, the macaroni tasted fake, etc. I would never eat it. Every now and then my Mom would pack lunches which I didn\u2019t eat as well as they tasted bad. In my elementary days I think I ate dinner fine though.\n\nSkip to middle school years. I think this is where everything went downhill? I still don\u2019t eat breakfast and if I do it only happens once every 1-2 months. I have time to eat it, but never do as I\u2019m not feeling hungry. In no way whatsoever am I trying to \u201cstarve\u201d myself or lose weight. (Keep in mind I\u2019m about 100 lb, so I\u2019m not underweight or anything). I still don\u2019t eat lunch that often because it doesn\u2019t taste good, but I do eat it maybe once a week. Even then I usually don\u2019t eat the main part and only have the fries and milk and give the rest to my friends. I don\u2019t really eat dinner at home as it tastes \u201cdry\u201d and unappetizing. I am constantly snacking on stuff though like granola bars, orange juice, seaweed, and other foods.\n\nIn the middle of 6th to the start of 7th grade I start getting constant stomach aches and diarrhea every day. My eating habits have stayed the same. My Mom had issues with being allergic to milk when she was a baby, and I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s lactose and tolerant. I think I could be too, as whenever she makes pasta, cereal, or foods regarding milk my stomach hurts. I\u2019ve talked to my Mom about being lactose intolerant and she said it\u2019s very likely but won\u2019t take me to the doctor for some reason.\n\nAnd it\u2019s so weird because I\u2019m literally never hungry and always eat so little whenever we\u2019re out. And if I try to eat when I\u2019m full, or eat something I don\u2019t like I just can\u2019t swallow it for some reason, I feel like I\u2019m gonna throw-up. For example today I woke up, had nothing to eat, at around 1 PM I went to with my grandma to a shop, had an ice cream, half a bottle of juice and a few bites of a waffle and I was completely full. I can barely eat without having an urge of stopping because I\u2019m full.\n\nDo I just have bad eating habits? Or do I have an eating disorder? Or is just that I\u2019m lactose intolerant? Please help, my stomachs hurting even at this moment and I want so badly for it to stop. I have no idea what\u2019s been wrong with me these few years and since my mother won\u2019t take to me to the doctor, I have to find out somehow.\n\nThank you for your time.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Nothing really dramatic nor painful though, just the skin cracking and peeling as if it were too dry, which I didn't really take as alarming cause I tend to have very dry, hard skin on my feet.\n\nThen some red blisters filled with liquid started to appear on the inner side, the sole or the top. I did a footbath with baking soda and/or tea tree oil every once in a while, which helped with the mild itching that I also experienced. But they kept coming and going all summer long (the picture attached shows the biggest \"rash\" that I had).\n\nThen as fall arrived they disappeared, which led me to think that they were caused by sweat and wearing sandals.\n\nNow they appeared again, still on my left foot in a sort of patch. The liquid in the blisters keeps returning even if I pop them. They always come out close to one another (usually two or three, forming a red patch) and I experience mild itchiness until they dry out completely and first layer of skin starts to peel off.\n\nI did some research (bad idea probably) and based on the images shown by Dr. Google I started to think it could be scabies (which seems unlikely cause I haven't had any symptoms until summer came again) or even diabetes!\n\nI'm an Italian student in Germany, I'm broke as hell, so if it isn't something in desperate need of treatment, avoiding a medical consultation would be really useful.\n\nThank you everybody!\n\n[Blisters from last summer](https://i.redd.it/4h83ws2tjt831.jpg)", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I got a UTI and it went away but later it \u201ccame back\u201d multiple times over the course of the next year except doctors couldn\u2019t find an infection (or found a very small amount of bacteria). Then at the end of last summer I got a stomach \u2018infection\u2019 that lasted 3 months where I would have these attacks where my stomach pain would be so painful I couldn\u2019t even move to go to the bathroom (doctor literally didn\u2019t care, told me to eat some yogurt and gave me some medicine to help with my uti and possible stomach infection). At the time of the visit I had also noted a swelling in my neck as well as a buffalo hump on the back of my lower part of my neck (I showed my friend and bf recently and they were like wtf that\u2019s so noticeable you need to see a doctor. Also note it\u2019s not fat, no matter how I stretch my neck it stays puffy and swollen) but the doctor seemed not to concerned but did agree I had swelling. I also told another doctor how occasionally I would get heart palpitations which had never happened before. My mother has thyroid disease and I was tested for that but it came back negative. Luckily the stomach attacks finally stopped (still have bathroom issues) but within two or three weeks I got Bell\u2019s palsy (I\u2019ve seen online that multiple people with Cushings disease had facial paralysis as an early sign, so I\u2019ve been thinking maybe it\u2019s that?). Furthermore I was recently told that they believe I have Interstitial Cystitis because I was peeing so frequently (at the worst around 15-20 times a day). The nurse practitioner who diagnosed me didn\u2019t run anything but a lab to make sure I didn\u2019t have a uti and examined my vagina (no devices to look at my bladder). My symptoms also don\u2019t seem to align with IC, as that tends to cause pain as the bladder fills whereas I don\u2019t have pain just pressure like it\u2019s full when it\u2019s not. And no food or anything seems to trigger it as the doctor suggested, only sex. Also out of no where my normal mild anxiety has sky rocketed to the point that I\u2019ve been having touch aversion during sex (no history of abuse there either so?) and the last few weeks my libido has been completely gone and I\u2019ve been unable to become lubricated during sex. Cognitively I have been doing terrible, (just one example:I literally forgot what year it was one day and I completely lost my sense of bearing I couldn\u2019t remember if it was 2019 or 2020).

So backstory: a few years ago (maybe 2) my mother started feeling a shooting pain in her toes, whenever she would walk and press down on the ball of her foot. She could feel it in her second pointer toe. She had recently switched from working in an office for 13 years to working as a grocery store clerk, standing on her feet all day. So that definitely played into it. She couldn\u2019t (and still can\u2019t) afford health insurance, and doesn\u2019t take very good care of herself regardless, and so ignored the problem hoping it would just go away. Fast forward two years, the pain hasn\u2019t gone away, now she has a full blown limp, her bad foot (which is the right one) is completely swollen all the time (always looks red and inflamed) and she has now given herself \u201cclaw\u201d toes; basically when your toes sort of tense up and don\u2019t stand down flat. She can\u2019t walk without being in pain, and when she does walk she limps pretty terribly. \n\nShe has been to a foot doctor who took an X-ray and said nothing was wrong (no fractures, no swollen tendons) and fit my mother for an orthopedic shoe insert (a hard, plastic one) that seems to be making everything worse. Mind you, my mother doesn\u2019t have health insurance and is in a terrible financial situation so this attempt to fix things put her out almost $2,000. She is clearly wary to just keep throwing money she doesn\u2019t have at different foot doctors until someone gets something right. I was wondering if anyone here had any advice, or had been though something similar and treated things at home in a way that worked? \n\nAccording to research I\u2019ve done online it doesn\u2019t sound like my mother has Metatarsalgia (an ailment that can sometimes feel like you are walking on stones or pebbles).  The internet also recommends taking time to rest the foot that is in pain, but she can\u2019t really just quit her job that requires her to stand on her feet all day and take a few months to rest her foot, seeing as her financial situation is terrible and she\u2019d quickly be homeless. I know the obvious next step would be to find an office job, but I\u2019m thinking it might take some time considering she has no college degree and no internet access, and I\u2019d like to have her start improving rather than worsening her condition before that day comes. It also seems (according to the inter web) that these types of ailments are generally fixed with lifestyle changes, or at-home therapies. Like I said, at this point she is not just addressing the initial pain in her foot but her limp, claw toes, swollen feet, and mental roadblock of not being able to walk and becoming increasingly anxious.  \n\nAnyone have anything similar to this and get a diagnosis? Anybody alleviate their symptoms in a way that really worked? Any methods you\u2019d recommend? Any shoe inserts/ medications/ stretches you\u2019d recommend that would help?\n\nI\u2019m terrified my mother is going to become completley immobile and then her financial situation would get really really dire.

This sensation is enough to alert me awake. Additionally, sometimes when half-asleep I feel like a bug is on me, which also makes me wake up in a bit of a panic. I am pretty sure that one of the times this happened was one of my pectoral muscles having a little spasm, but it was enough for me to think a bug was on me so I was definitely awake after this.\n\nAny help you can provide would be most appreciated.

However, sometimes when I swallow, I feel it in my chest, around where the breastbone is, slightly to my right.\n\nIt feels like I have a weight on my chest, but I can take a big deep breath without issue.\n\nI am also coming off of a cold, I had it all last week. I also lift heavy. I was on vacation last week and didn't lift, but I did do some strenuous kayaking and hiking.\n\nUnfortunately I don't have insurance, and I have applied to get it through my state, but I will go to the urgent care if I need to.\n\nIf there's any other specifics I can give, please let me know. I will try my best. This pain is very new to me and I don't know what to make of it.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

At first I thought I was having anxiety attacks since there have been several stressors in my life recently (work, studying for entrance exams, recent breakup), and the chest pains often came with a \"feeling of impending doom\" entailed by panic attacks. However, as these pains have been occurring more frequently, I've noticed the chest pains often come first, then a wave of anxiety (possibly due to, you know, chest pain). They occur most often when I'm laying down in bed, especially before sleep. Shortness of breath and heart palpitations are also present. Rubbing my sternum makes a feeling that mimics the pain, making me suspect costochondritis. An EKG was taken when I went to the ER and I was told my heart was fine; the doctors said it was likely a panic attack, but I feel like I've been managing my stress fairly well lately.

It's like a weakness/loss of strength, combined with severe fatigue. The symptoms vary in terms of severeness, but they don't change, they are just amplified. It happens 90% of the time in the late afternoon or early evening, &gt; 4pm.  \n\n\nBy this time when the symptoms occur, I have very little energy, and everything starts to shut down.   \nI move slower as my muscles feel extremely heavy and unmovable.  \nMy speech becomes slurred and when I speak I don't make sense all the time, as if my mental state or capability to think straight is reduced.  \nI stop paying attention to my surroundings more and more.  \nI end up with no will or desire to do anything, I think it's a result of a lack of energy, because any mental effort is very taxing at this point, I pretty much turn complete zombie mode.  \nThere's something else to it that I'm unable to describe, it has to be the combination of no energy and fatigue, I'm just completely out of it.  \n\n\nAbout me:   \nI'm a 22 year old male, 6'2, 280 pounds. I don't have any mental struggles whatsoever (anxiety, depression and the like), I'm a motivated person.

My eating habits aren't the best, but I don't think they're terrible either, granted I don't eat many vegetables. I've been drinking more water lately, so I believe I'm hydrated enough as well. I'm a programmer, and I get very little excercise as a result most days, although I play badminton on the weekends.  \n\n\nWhatever is happening to me has me completely stumped, but it ruins my entire evening (sometimes my entire day) when this happens, and it happens frequently enough, seemingly at random. And I swear to you, the next day, the symptoms disappear entirely, and I'm perfectly fine.  \n\n\nSeeing a doctor is very difficult, I'm from Canada, and as I recently moved I don't have a family doctor to see, and if I show up in the Emergency Room, they're gonna triage me, and think \"Wow this guy is just tired\", and I end up waiting far to long for it to be worth it, this has happened before.  \n\n\nI appreciate any guesses as to what's going on, if I've missed some details or anything don't be afraid to ask.

The best way to describe the pain is a dull sensation in the entire left chest cavity; to the left of the sternum, below the clavicle, and above the diaphragm. Sometimes, however, the pain will be piercing and generalized. This generalized pain will usually strike for a few seconds and then disappear, after which the dull pains return. The piercing pains, that almost feel like someone is stabbing me for a quick second is usually located right below my left nipple or to the right of it. Up to the point of these symptoms beginning, I was a healthy 34yr old Caucasian male. With that being said, I have to get something off my chest. No pun intended.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have to rewind the clock to April 8, 2019, where it all may have begun. During this second week of April, my company flew me and others from the company out to San Francisco, CA, for a major conference that had estimated attendance of around 30,000 \u2013 50,000 people from around the world. Being that I live in the Midwest, the flight was roughly four hours and was uneventful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe second day of the business trip, the guys that I was with decided the wanted to stop at an apothecary, since, you know, it\u2019s legal there. I went with them reluctantly, but I know nothing about cannabis or synthesized drugs. Matter of fact, I haven\u2019t smoked weed in over 15 years. I sat there and waited while they shopped. They ended up picking up things like \u201cdog walkers\u201d and \u201cgummies\u201d.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat night, they opened their goodie bags and started with the \u201cdog walkers\u201d. \u201cDog walkers\u201d come to find out are pre-rolled joints that take about 10-15 minutes to complete\u2014about the same time it takes to walk your dog. I decided to partake in this, by taking a couple of hits. No biggie. Being that it was just a couple of hits, I did not experience a high, or any symptoms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day, before heading out to dinner, they opened their \u201cgummies\u201d. Each of them took one before heading out, so I decided, \u201cwhat the heck, it can\u2019t be that bad.\u201d So, I chewed one myself. Dinner was at a sushi restaurant and was uneventful up until the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the waitress was bringing out the bill, I all of the sudden started to get really hot, clammy, and life started to get fuzzy. Radiating feelings were rushing all over my body. I thought, for a minute, I was having a heart issue. I told the waitress to call 911. The colleagues of mine were trying to calm me down and reassure me that nothing was wrong. But I had my doubts as I had never experienced anything like this before in my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince no one was calling 911, I went outside and called them myself. I was able to accurately tell the operator my precise location even being in a foreign area. The ambulance finally came, which seemed like forever by the way, and obviously the first thing that they started asking was, \u201cwhat have I had to eat?\u201d, \u201chave I had any illegal substances?\u201d etc. I told them I had a bunch of different sushi\u2019s for the first time in my life and that maybe I was having an allergic reaction to them. They hooked me up to monitors and whatnot. I wasn\u2019t ever able to answer them about the illegal substances.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs time went on, I was not getting any better, and more symptoms were coming. Some of the new symptoms were that I had to urinate really bad, and that I had super dry mouth. They knew immediately once I mentioned these symptoms what I had done, so they re-asked me the question from earlier: \u201chave I had any illegal substances?\u201d. This time I was able to answer them and I answered them truthfully: \u201cI had one gummy, and the gummy was of the Sativa blend and on the package it said 10mg THC.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter stating this, the paramedics breathed a sigh of relief as they knew I was going to recover fine. They still took me to the hospital for monitoring. Once there, I remember the doctor distinctly saying \u201cWelcome to the club! You\u2019re high!\u201d Awesome. I was trying to tell him that I\u2019ve been high once in my life, and that this is no high. But he reassured me that a gummy high is completely different than a smoking high as the gummy goes through your digestive tract. After two hours of trying to calm down, I was not getting better. I\u2019m sure they wanted their room back for other patients so to expedite the discharge they gave me the following medications (unknown dosages):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* LORazepam (ATIVAN)\n* OLANZapine ODT (zyPREXA ZYDIS)\n* Ondansetron ODT (ZOFRAN)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 30 minutes after those were given, I was dismissed. Made it back to our accommodations, ate some food, and went to bed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day I was fine. Even flying back two days later, I was fine. Matter of fact, over the next two weeks I was fine. Until\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo weeks after this incident, my wife developed a mild fever (no higher than 102\u00b0F) and was bedridden for a day. Following that, I developed a fever, but mine was more serious. For three days, I was fighting temperatures between 103\u00b0F-105\u00b0F. Being that I haven\u2019t had a fever in close to 20 years, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had one that serious, I really didn\u2019t know what to do. So, I did what I thought was right, and took Tylenol (Acetaminophen) every six hours. After the first day, and Tylenol not seeming to help, I stopped the Tylenol and went to a hybrid NSAID. The hybrid pill was a combination of Acetaminophen 500mg and Aspirin 500mg, which was purchased at Walgreen\u2019s. This seemed to help. Every six hours I was at least able to get out of bed for a bit and eat and socialize with my family. This window of socializing was brief. After about 30 minutes the temperature would jet back up. The only other symptom during the fever was a severely sore throat and two sensitive spots on my neck\u2014to the left and right of my Adam\u2019s apple.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLuckily, this fever only put me out of work for a day (it started on a Friday night, and didn\u2019t let up until Monday mid-day). Tuesday, I returned to work. People were ecstatic to see me, but were reluctant to interact with me because my voice was kind of hoarse. As the day went on, I progressively got better and felt generally well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat night, while sitting at my computer late at night, a strange sensation, which started in my back and felt like a band squeezing my body, raced across my body. I knew this feeling. It was the same exact feeling I had two weeks prior after my bout with the gummy bear. This time, however, I was clean. I had learned my life lesson. So, what was it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis feeling put me in a panic. My mind was racing exclaiming \u201cnot this again!\u201d I suddenly had the urge to defecate and of course then the thought of \u201cI\u2019m having a heart issue and I\u2019m going to be found in the bathroom\u201d came across me. Reluctantly, I took care of my business while trying to handle new, never felt symptoms like: dizziness, racing heart, burning skin, shooting pains, a sensation of doom, etc. After this, I crawled into bed and woke up my wife to let her know what was going on. She busted out the blood pressure gauge and started checking that. Normal range. So, she just sat up our bed and tried calming me down. It worked\u2014until I started falling into sleep. As I would fall into sleep, my body would awake itself with a gasp and some new symptom would present itself. The first time was shaking. Rinse and repeat. An hour later, cold sweats. An hour after that, chest pains / thumping / racing. Each time too I would have to urinate. After a few hours of trying to battle these symptoms, I had her call 911.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe paramedics came out and did their standard procedure for chest pains on me. First step, EKG. That returned fine, so they started asking questions. Again, this time, no illegal substances, so I really had nothing for them. They took me to the hospital for monitoring. They conducted a battery of tests. After a few hours and not showing any symptoms and all levels in range, they dismissed me. No medications given. The discharge papers read: Atypical chest pain, and viral infection. The latter was because I told them I just wrapped up a fever the day before. If interested in the tests they did, click below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Comp Metabolic Panel: [https://imgur.com/EMkURW9](https://imgur.com/EMkURW9)\n* Troponin: [https://imgur.com/zLY8VI0](https://imgur.com/zLY8VI0)\n* CBC Panel: [https://imgur.com/dauYFW7](https://imgur.com/dauYFW7)\n* Chest X-ray: [https://imgur.com/e9Mq8Lf](https://imgur.com/e9Mq8Lf)\n* Urinalysis: [https://imgur.com/e9obiQJ](https://imgur.com/e9obiQJ)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce home, I was having a hard time calming down as I was still experiencing chest pains and unstableness. Because they essentially dismissed me as nothing is wrong, I decided to go on a walk. I walked for about 5 miles before returning home. This walk did not help me. Chest still hurt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter trying to deal with it all day, I knew it couldn\u2019t be right, so that night I checked myself back into the ER. To sum up this visit, the doctor on staff basically said that since I was in there earlier, she wasn\u2019t going to run that battery of tests again and that based off what she saw, I was fine. She dismissed me with a prescription for Ambien and Prevacid. It was too late to fill so I went home and tried to go to bed. Rough night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made it to work the next day, but it was super rough. A couple of times I wanted to just leave and go to the ER, but since two doctors said I was fine, I just fought through it. Throughout the day I was unstable, dizzy, hyperaware, weak, lightheaded, and at times would have zaps in my chest. I made it through the day though. On the way home, I filled my prescription for Ambien and Prevacid. That night, I popped an Ambien early and tried to go to bed. My body fought that Ambien for four hours. Around midnight is when I finally got to sleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day I was scheduled to see my appointed PCP (never really sick in my life so never had a PCP). I saw him and he asked, \u201chow\u2019s the past couple of days been?\u201d I truthfully answered, \u201cit\u2019s sucked and this Ambien sucks and I feel like I\u2019m having major health issues and doctors keep dismissing my symptoms.\u201d He looked me over and ordered a TSH Levels Test and a Lipid Panel. Details of those test are below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* TSH: [https://imgur.com/Iu2LXHl](https://imgur.com/Iu2LXHl)\n* Lipid Panel: [https://imgur.com/toIBWO1](https://imgur.com/toIBWO1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, he prescribed Atarax (hydrOXYzine) to substitute the Ambien and Xanax (ALPRAZolam) as new and ordered a follow up in two weeks. Obviously, with these prescriptions he thinks I have anxiety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat night, I took the Atarax, and for the first time in a few days I slept like a baby. My FitBit registered 14 hours of sleep. As soon as I got up though, the chest pain was back. I popped the Prevacid (I don\u2019t regularly have reflux, but the earlier doctor prescribed it so that if I did, I wouldn\u2019t confuse it or exacerbate the pain) and the Xanax. Neither of these really helped the pain, so I just kind of lounged around all day and did no physical activity. Throughout that day and over the next couple of weeks, while doing the same prescription regiment (Atarax, Xanax, and Prevacid in the AM), I would get sudden feelings of pressure or squeezing under the breastbone, or pain radiating out to my arms, or dizziness (like vertigo), and with all this: heightened anxiety. A couple of times during this two-week period, I would spit up brown phlegm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to the two-week follow-up with the PCP. During this visit he asked how things are coming along, and of course I answered: \u201cworst two weeks of my life. These prescriptions aren\u2019t working. Matter of fact during that two-week cycle I didn\u2019t take the Xanax for three days and still had the same symptoms and now I have pain tender to touch in areas.\u201d The new tender to touch pain got flagged as Costochondritis. With this prescription regiment not working, he wanted me to wear a Holter Monitor for a few days. Results of Holter Monitor are here:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Report: [https://www.scribd.com/document/416656041/Holter-Monitor-Redacted](https://www.scribd.com/document/416656041/Holter-Monitor-Redacted)\n* Interpretation: [https://imgur.com/8IFy1u5](https://imgur.com/8IFy1u5)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few days after the report came back, I had a follow-up with the PCP to review the results. He said, along with the interpretation doctor, that everything was in normal boundaries. Me, still having chest pains and crazy sensations, I asked for more. Doctor insisted it\u2019s Costochondritis but went along with my requests. He ordered Rib X-Rays, a Pulmonary Function Test, and an Echo Stress Test. Getting through all of these tests took about a week, but below are the results:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* X-Rays: [https://imgur.com/Mnwtqjz](https://imgur.com/Mnwtqjz)\n* PFT Results: [https://imgur.com/CXBVO3X](https://imgur.com/CXBVO3X)\n* PFT Interpretation: [https://imgur.com/HHXjWwi](https://imgur.com/HHXjWwi)\n* Echo Stress: [https://imgur.com/yXTiXwj](https://imgur.com/yXTiXwj)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMake your own interpretation, but after reviewing the results with my PCP, he basically said they were all normal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter all these \u201cnormal\u201d tests, I finally decided to throw the towel in and say it\u2019s anxiety. I\u2019ve never had anxiety and/or panic attacks before. I have no family history of them, and for the most part I really don\u2019t believe in anxiety since my life / stressors are in pretty good shape.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decided early June that I would try to get off these prescribed pills. The only prescribed pills I was on at this point that I needed to stop was Xanax, and Prevacid (I stopped the Atarax about 15 days after it was prescribed). On top of these pills I was taking 400mg of Ibuprofen daily. The Prevacid was easy to stop. I literally just stopped taking it. Again, I wasn\u2019t having acid reflux. The Xanax and Ibuprofen were harder to stop. The Ibuprofen was suppressing the chest pain and the Xanax was suppressing the mind. The combination of these two was working\u2014somewhat. That being said I started weaning off it. Instead of daily, I started to take when needed. Initially I\u2019d go a day without taking, then I\u2019d go three days, then five days, then nine days, and I\u2019m happy to report as of this writing I haven\u2019t had either in over three weeks, however, I still have chest discomfort.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs time moved forward, my symptoms were getting better. I wouldn\u2019t have sudden feelings of pressure or squeezing under the breastbone, pain radiating out to my arms, dizziness, or doom sensations anymore. Recently my symptoms are a couple zaps here and there (I\u2019d tell myself that\u2019s just my body\u2019s way of telling me my heart is still there), some random PCVs (recorded by Apple Watch), random low-grade panic attacks (resolved by thinking of other things), and mild discomfort in the left chest cavity, however, now I have a new symptom not had before: headaches.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese aren\u2019t your standard headaches we all know. These headaches are right on the top of my head. Dead center. Initially I thought they were rebound headaches since I was taking Xanax and Ibuprofen daily for almost a month, but that had stopped and plenty of time has passed. Do rebound headaches persist that long after not taking medications? Another thing to consider is that headaches are yet another symptom of anxiety. Has it that my body is still recovering and this it\u2019s way now of showing anxiety? Further, I feel like I\u2019m scratching my head more often than before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decided at the end of June to follow up with my PCP since I hadn\u2019t seen him in about a month. I told him how things are progressing, but I still wasn\u2019t completely convinced that all these symptoms that I\u2019ve never experienced in my life is anxiety. So, he ordered a Chest CT without Contrast. Results of that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* CT Narrative: [https://imgur.com/mOuJr3v](https://imgur.com/mOuJr3v)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, normal. But, again, I still have chest discomfort that just won\u2019t go away. Nothing seems to make it better and it usually begins about 30-60 seconds of waking up. I get fooled every morning because I\u2019ll get up and be amazed how well I fell, then about 30-60 seconds later the pain hits me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEarly on in this fight against possible psychosomatic factors, prior to the headaches, and prior to the Echo Stress Test I wanted to see a cardiologist just to reassure me that I wasn\u2019t having any blockage, because honestly that\u2019s what it feels like in my chest all the damn time\u2014it feels like a clogged sewer. Cardiologists are booked like two months in advance around here so I booked with the hopes that by the time that time frame comes around that I would be fine. But I wasn\u2019t and kept the appointment. That appointment was just this week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis office did an EKG on me and he personally looked me over, I think, thoroughly. He basically said based off my history that I\u2019m low-risk for anything, but he still wants to do an Echocardiogram 2D Doppler on me to make sure I don\u2019t have any faults. That\u2019s scheduled 10 days from now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo wrap this all up. I\u2019m on no pills, not even OTC pills today. The only thing I am taking is George\u2019s Aloe Vera water (the water can help the inflammation associated with Costochondritis) and vitamins (i.e.: Vitamin C, Vitamin B12, L-Theanine). I still have chest pain which I can damn near pinpoint (primarily right below the left nipple and to the right of the left nipple) which persists consistently and usually begins 30-60 seconds after waking up and I guess psychosomatic symptoms (headaches, fear of dying, zaps, etc). Should I continue pushing for more tests like a Gallium Scan, or an angiogram? The reason I would want to keep pushing is that recently my Uncle and friend of my neighbor had very similar symptoms with \u201cnormal\u201d findings on all the tests that they did but didn\u2019t find the root of their problem until they pushed for an angiogram. Granted, I\u2019m fairly young so I shouldn\u2019t be worrying about blockages especially since my cholesterol levels were normal this past check. What are your thoughts? I love to hear some feedback from other medical professionals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading and I look forward to your response\n\n\\-- /u/swerenfl", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

A few weeks later I started to get sensitivity to light, and I am in a school with bright lights so my eyes also usually tear up, and get irritated. I've been hearing voices like murmuring for a few months. My appetite has also increased. I've been getting mood swings like sudden bursts of anger, and I get irritated more easily by people.

I try to be as active as I can but not being able to walk more than 100 yards at a time severely limits what I can do. \n\nHere is my quandary:  If this was all caused by my Gluteus minimus and medius being weak from sitting all day, when I walk and force those muscles to work to failure, I would expect to feel the post-exercise soreness associated with that kind of activity. Also, I would think that I should be able to go further as I exercise more and strengthen those muscles. \n\nJust the opposite is happening. I never feel the post-exercise soreness in the muscles around the hip and this has been getting progressively worse over the past few years.  About five years ago the pain and weakness showed up after walking for an hour. Now I struggle after 100 yards. \n\nAny additional insight into this situation is greatly appreciated.\n\nAlso, I have tried chiropractic care and acupuncture with no affect.

I have had many tests, including MRIs, CTs, several blood panels, stool tests, colonoscopy, and an upper endoscopy, all of which come back normal. I have tried gabapentin, amytriptyline, nortryptyline, an abdominal wall nerve block, and a topical compounded cream, none of which worked. The gabapentin, amytriptyline, and nortryptyline made my symptoms worse and had intolerable side effects.

The ache only occurs on my right side, specifically in the teeth and gums around my right incisor, not in my front teeth/gums or back teeth/gums. Sometimes the pain is strongest in the upper row of theeth/gums. Sometimes it's strongest in the lower teeth and gums. And sometimes it's equally strong in both the upper and lower teeth and gums.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe pain is periodic and occurs mainly when I eat, drink, or lay down to sleep at night, specifically when I try to sleep on my right side. The ache has lasted from a few minutes to some 30+ minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried testing out various foods; hot, cold, acidic, non-acidic, but there doesn't seem to be any distinctive relations between what I eat and what triggers the ache. Sometimes I can eat a big meal and drink ice water and there's no ache at all. Most other times just a quick snack or a glass of milk or juice can trigger the ache almost immediately.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have mostly been able to subdue most of the pain taking OTC painkillers ibuprofen and paracetamol. But on occasion they haven't had any effect on the pain which is really odd to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the last month, I've visited three different, unrelated dentists, to get three different opinions. All of them said that there is absolutely nothing wrong with my teeth whatsoever and that I have some of the most healthy teeth and gums they have seen. They all said there was no tooth decay, cavities, gingivitis or anything wrong at all and that I take very good care of my teeth. I also had x-rays taken and they very clearly show that there has been no change in my teeth over the last 5+ years. It should be noted that I have never had my teeth whitened, neither at home or at a clinic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then went to my GP who did some tests to see if my facial nerves are inflamed in any way but couldn't find anything. She basically doesn't have a clue or any indication but gave me a referral to go see a neurologist. However, all(!) neurologists in my area are closed right now and in the following weeks, and the one that is open has a crazy long waiting list.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't have a history of any kind of illness, I don't smoke, I don't do drugs (other than the many, many painkillers I've been taking since this \"toothache\" started).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've searched the web for hours without an answer and asked on several dentistry related sites to no avail.

If I laid down, I couldn\u2019t feel any pain at all. I went to a urologist who diagnosed me with epididymo-orchitis and prescribed a 2 week course of Levofloxacin. After 2 weeks, the pain was gone and the swelling subsided considerably. The doctor prescribed more Levofloxacin and scheduled an ultrasound. The swelling is probably 80% reduced and there is no pain whatsoever. \n\nAfter the ultrasound, the radiologist stated that there was low blood flow to the testicle.

Not utterly horrendous or anything but just kind of different. But anyways in general, sometimes I'll get this throbbing sensation right on my forehead, like in the center. Not always with pain though. And sometimes random times, sounds/lights randomly become somewhat bothersome to me even though they're not most of the time. And it's just rather annoying at times. Not necessarily along with the headache though.\n\nAnd at times, I'll get this kind of sharp headache either in the center of my forehead or often in the temples. Not really severe or anything though. And anyways the last three days, I have had kind of an odd sort of headache. The first couple days, it mostly just seemed like a normal headache. Would kind of move around a bit between different parts of my head. Felt a little bit sharp, but it was just an ordinary headache mostly. Felt a bit nauseous as well but nothing remarkable. At a couple of points, it felt like it went away when I rested for a bit but then came back when I was up and walking around.\n\nAnd in the night last night, I woke up in the night.... and it was pretty bad comparatively. Not horrendous or anything but worse than before, not bad enough to keep me from sleeping though or really that bad or anything. Just worse than before. For some reason I didn't feel like getting up because I felt like the headache may get worse and if I got up I'd probably end up feeling pretty shitty all day being tired and having the headache and all, and I went back to bed. Which did lessen it. Then, today it was a little weird. At a few points later in the day I felt sort of dizzy/just generally bad and also the headache got a bit stronger. And after I climbed up the stairs, I noticed that it was kind of oscillating in that spot between not there at all and worse.\n\nIt was not debilitatingly severe or anything but quite noticeable. And sort of seemed concentrated in my temples. I've also felt really tired during these three days and sort of \"out of it\" at points. Like my mind wasn't as sharp/things weren't flowing as smoothly mentally. And there were moments where bright lights and such had a sort of different quality, not horribly irritating or anything just kind of more pronounced/mildly irritating when it wouldn't be usually. Though, it kind of subsided, but I did notice the headache a little bit at points over the next few weeks.\n\nIt kind of came back the other day throughout the day, though I thought it went away. But yesterday a little after I got done working out, it got pretty bad. I also felt generally off, and I felt a little bit more sensitive to things in a way. Like just things in the physical environment. I closed the blinds, because the light was bothering me a little. Got a little nauseous as well. And after taking a warm shower, I ended up feeling better. I'm not sure exactly how long it lasted, but it seemed to go away. I did notice it a bit later in the night though, just the headache, not anything else. It wasn't constant and generally isn't. It was just kind of brief, sharp spikes of the bad headache, then it would go away, and I'd notice it. Seemed like maybe standing up or leaning down would trigger it.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I have severe restless leg syndrome, but it's a totally different sensation. I will randomly have fairly severe pain above my knee and in my thigh in one or both legs, depending on the day. It's most frequent at night, but sometimes I'll wake up in the morning and it'll be there, but usually much more severe than it is at night.

The pain is usually accompanied by nausea and brain fog, and it *really* interferes with my life when it happens. I have to take upwards of 600 mg of ibuprofen to notice any sort of difference, even 800 mg doesn't always stop the pain. I know it's not great for me, but when it's bad, I'll take 1600 mg ibuprofen and 1000 mg Tylenol in a day.

I'm planning on going to the doctors, shortly, about this, but I was hoping that perhaps someone would be able to point me in the right direction or tell me if I'm way off base.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst off, I'm a 27 year old female, and I lead a moderately active, healthy lifestyle (I work in an office but walk to and from work (just over 3 miles a day) plus I walk on my lunch break at work, and I go to the gym 3-4 times a week (barre, pilates, hiit classes). I eat normally, with a lot of veggies and lean proteins, but also, I don't say no to the occasional burger and fries, Neapolitan pizza, or bowl of pasta. I perhaps drink more than I should, usually having a happy hour after work (a glass or two of wine, either reading by myself or chatting with a friend or meeting up with my bf. It's my favorite way to wind down after a long day of work), and then either a glass of wine with dinner or a nightcap later on. I never really drink alone (other than me enjoying my book with a glass of wine, which doesn't seem problematic), so while it does seem like I drink a lot, it's nearly all in social situations. This lifestyle has not changed in the past say, 4 years, and I noticed no change with my body. I float around 118-120lbs, and have for most of my adult life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the past 5 months, I've noticed a bit of a change. I have the Implanon birth control (the little stick that gets inserted into the upper arm), and since getting it, my periods have been irregular. Annoying, certainly, but I was told it is a common side effect and I have accepted it being that I like the other benefits of this option of birth control. In the early spring, I was experiencing an influx of irregular bleeding and a lot of pain in my pelvic region, and after going to the doctors they told me that I have quite a few cysts in my ovaries, which is causing the pain. They attributed the especially irregular bleeding to my birth control.   \n\n\nAround three months ago, I have suddenly gained weight without any changes to my diet, activity levels, or habits. I gained about 7 pounds, which to me seems significant, being as nothing in my life has changed. I have no idea what the pounds could be from (I've been sleeping fine, I haven't been under extreme stress). Also, I have noticed that my hair seems to be quite a bit thinner than it had been. I'm pathetically hyper-aware of my hair, being that I've never had a luxurious mane of hair so, when I wear it up, I need to be aware of it falling strangely or else my scalp is visible. I know plenty of other women like this, so I was never concerned, but now it seems like there are actual spots of thinning around my head (especially by the temples, and behind the ears. My hair texture has always been balanced, but now it seems to be quite dry. I don't wash my hair daily (about every other day), and the days when I wash and deeply condition my hair, and follow up with a bevy of leave-in-conditioners, it is smooth, but the next day it becomes absolutely unruly and parched. I've always had beautiful, strong nails but lately they've been breaking and peeling unusually. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've never had an especially angular face, but recently it looks downright puffy, which I just attributed to the mysterious, unshakable weight gain. I've always had sore hips, but that may just be from sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day. I've always run warm, but lately I've been freezing in my office and am always asking my bf to turn down the AC in the car...but this just might be normal office AC temps in the summertime. I've always had a lot of energy and pep, but lately around late afternoon through the rest of the evening, I find myself just absolutely exhausted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNone of these symptoms are devastating (I'm most upset about the weight gain and perceived hair loss) but I don't want to sound or be a hypochondriac. \n\nBased on what I said, do you think it's possible I could have an issue with my thyroid?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I was finally given a sitz marker test. The entire week after taking the capsule, I didn't poop. The X-ray showed all the markers were still there and scattered throughout my colon.\n\nI went to a surgeon who told me my colon wasn't working (4+ gastro specialists told me nothing was wrong when it's obvious something was) and he performed an ileostomy in February.\n\nSeveral months after ostomy surgery, I started passing more mucus and experiencing cramping. I went to the local ER where an X-ray was done. I could feel something needed to come out but the doctor said that the X-ray showed my intestines were completely empty. Due to the pain, I had to travel 3 hours away to the ER of the hospital where I had my surgery. They did a CT scan which revealed a \"significant amount of stool\" in my colon, so I now know that when told my system was empty in the past at the local ER, it had to be a lie. I was diagnosed with diversion colitis and sent home.\n\nI had assumed all of my problems were due to back up from the constipation, but before surgery and currently I can feel food in me even long after I've eaten.\n\nI wait a while after eating before laying down. When I wake up and am ready to change my ostomy bag, the first thing I do is shower. That's over 9 hours of not eating or drinking anything, but I can still feel food in me and my ostomy starts being active during my bag change, which makes it a longer and more frustrating process than it should be.\n\nPeople have suggested that I may have gastroparesis but I've never been diagnosed or even tested for it.\n\nI have to think it's all connected. I do have an appointment with a GI at the end of October after the hospital put off making an appointment for me for at least a month. Every doctor either can't or won't help me. I'd love to start with having my colon removed and everything closed up now that I have an ostomy, but even if that were to happen (I'd probably have to be half dead before they'd even consider it) it wouldn't help with the organs leading up to it.\n\nI know it's going backwards asking doctors and THEN the internet, and I've been asking on here for years, but with no doctors who care enough to even investigate within the first several visits, if I don't get some kind of miraculous answer from a stranger I'm completely screwed.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

For the past 7 days I have been unable to taste anything on the tip of my tongue.    \n\n\nMy symptoms are as follows:  \n\n\n\\- Raised (and very visible tastebuds on the tip of my tongue)\n\n\\- Roof of mouth feels like wax when rubbing my tongue against it\n\n\\- Occasionally the tip of my tongue feels like it's been scalded from eating overly hot foods (even though I havent).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I first discovered that the sensation had gone, I consulted with a doctor via Teladoc who upon hearing my symptoms said that it sounded like a mild case of Thrush, or it could potentially be something that sounded like Glau-Kye-Den (I have no idea how to spell what he said so pardon me for butchering it).  He wrote me a prescription for Nystatin (liquid suspension) and told me to take it until the bottle was empty.  When he told me Thrush I went to Google images to see if my tongue would match what I saw, and unfortunately my tongue doesnt look anything like what I saw.\n\n  \nTo get a second opinion I went to the ER because I thought if a doctor could actually physically see my tongue then perhaps I would get what I thought could be a better diagnosis.  Not to my surprise the ER doctor said that it didnt seem like Thrush, but he said that he seldom see's Thrush in the ER, and when he does they're extreme cases which mine was not.

I noticed some achy pain in the back of my left calf three days ago. Nothing horrible, I can walk and bend my leg just fine, but it's very specific pain and just under my knee. This pain has since moved to my thigh (both my thigh and calf hurt, the pain just moved up), same ache, no redness/swelling/numbness. I get leg aches during my period but I'm in the very middle of my cycle so it's not PMS. I do get stomach cramps during ovulation, but never leg pain, so I can't tell if this is hormonal or not.\n\nToday I noticed a vein on my chest. It's blue, above my breasts (closer to my collarbone), vertical, and about three-ish inches long. I have no chest pain so I'm not sure if the vein correlates with my leg or not, but it appeared along with the aches. It isn't bulging or anything. Just there. \n\nI'm not in any devastating pain here, but this is making me nervous. I'm eating and working out as normal. Could it just be hormones?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

It got more intense on the last few months.\n\n\nHey everyone. I posted some months ago about a discomfort I've been having for quite some time in my groin area, specially on my right side and most noticeable during sex.\n\n\nLong story short, after a few visits to the doctor I got an ultrasound and they diagnosed me with two inguinal hernias, one on each side. They told me they were very small (the right one was the bigger one) and they were on the \"fatty tissue\" stage, so there was no rush to perform surgery unless it suddenly gets worse. I have an appointment for September, and I'll probably get surgery on September or October.\n\n\nHowever, I'm a bit worried about the discomfort I'm having: I feel no noticeable bump on my groin, but I definitely feel discomfort (and pain if I press too hard) on my groin. I randomly feel a pulling sensation on it, mostly if I'm sitting, and the most concerning issue for me:\n\nAs soon as I touch my penis, I feel this slight pulling sensation going all the way to the right side of my groin. If I masturbate/have sex, this pressure builds up up until the point of orgasm, where it doesn't really hurt, but I feel the kind of discomfort you feel when you push an area too hard. It sounds strange, but if I \"focus\" I can definitely feel the sensation only on the groin, it's like it connects with the penis. \n\nIt usually depends on the day, but it's there constantly. If I \"hold\" my groin pushing gently while having sex the sensation goes away slightly, sometimes it doesn't even happen (which is really refreshing).\n\n\nIs this normal? I can provide more details if needed.\n\n\nThank you.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

The reason being is that it started out one morning incredibly strong on my butt, hips, inner/outer thighs, and behind the knee caps. Also, I treated infected spots right away using an old athletes foot spray bottle that contained miconazole nitrate which seemed to work pretty well.\n\n\nLuckily, as soon as I ran out of the spray, I conceitedly had a doctors appt. Spoke to my doctor and showed him the rash? to which he didn't know by simply by looking. He did however prescribe me some anti fungal cream (forgot drug name, but started w/ a K), as well as a steroid cream. The steroid cream worked incredibly well and almost everything disappeared w/ the prescribed cream combo. However, I ran out and shortly within a few days of no cream it came back w/ a vengeance.\n\n\nAs of today, it started to move across [the side of my body, and arms](https://imgur.com/a/p6H7QFm), and unfortunately cannot see my doctor for quite some time.

Shower thoroughly twice a day, and washed my sheets basically every other day over the last month. Also, I've done a great job kept infected areas dry and cool as well solid airflow.

The later my period is, the worse it gets. I\u2019ll find myself snapping at people I care about with little to no provoking and I find it hard to get anything done. I don\u2019t really feel like doing the hobbies that I love such as music, language, or writing.\n\nSometimes, I just get depressed. During the school year, I\u2019m honestly a mess on the days leading up to my period. The littlest things can make me want to break down in tears.\n\nAlong with these irregularities and emotional symptoms, there are other things I struggle with as well related to PCOS.\n\nI still struggle to keep my acne under control despite being on accutane at one point, and I also struggle immensely with keeping myself from becoming overweight. Now, I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019ve only really been watching what I\u2019m eating and exercising for about a year, but I don\u2019t think I ever ate any worse than other girls around me.\n\nEven when I\u2019m really trying, the scale just doesn\u2019t budge. This is extremely frustrating, and leads to me feeling awful about my body.\n\nAlong with this, another symptom I\u2019ve noticed is that often, I find these weird patches of brownish, almost orangish skin. They\u2019re noticeable to me, as my skin is very pale and white. \n\nMy mother has already scheduled me an appointment with an OBGYN soon, so don\u2019t worry, I will be seeing a real professional about this, but I want to prepare myself for what news I could receive ahead of time, and get opinions to see if people think there is a chance I could have it.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

A dull ache under my breasts, and also in my back (on my right side where my bra hooks. In that area). Sometimes it was just a dull ache, other times it'd be a full blown attack. I'd cry from the pain. I went to a primary doctor and he told me he thought I had GERD. He prescribed Zantac for my attacks and a muscle relaxer for my back.\n\nThe muscle relaxer didn't help and Zantac worked for a while. Eventually I stopped taking it and stopped having problems with it.\n\nCut to a few months ago, I start having pain again. The attacks start getting bad. Under my breasts start radiating pain to my back. It gets so bad that I'd normally just throw up to try to relieve it. Zantac works for a while but doesn't anymore. The only thing that ever helps relieve it is running really hot water on both spots in the shower.\n\nOnce I go to sleep and wake up, it's always gone. Almost like it was never there. But while it's happening and I'm having an attack, it's the worst pain ever. It just... hurts. I can't get comfortable in any spot. It's just hell.\n\nMost of the time I don't have attacks, but I still have really annoying discomfort after eating. Under my breasts but mostly in that spot on my back. It's sore to touch. It's the most infuriating pain ever. And I don't know what foods trigger it. It's always so random.

Apologies if it sounds a bit pretentious, that\u2019s just my weird writing. P.s this was first posted on r/mentalhealthsupport but then I found this thread as well, so I figured it was worth a shot. Feel free to ask questions.\n\nI am always bored. I don\u2019t know when it started or if I just realised and it had always been like it is. It\u2019s not just idle boredom, either. It almost hurts, but mentally. When I do things, I get a break, but it\u2019s still there, like I\u2019m just distracting myself from it. At first I wasn\u2019t sure why, but eventually, I knew the cause: I don\u2019t feel anything.\n\nWhen I realised this, things made more sense. I don\u2019t feel things. I don\u2019t feel happy, I don\u2019t feel love (or attachment to friends or family), I don\u2019t feel sad, I just feel nothing, not even empty, as though there is not a vacancy, but nothing there originally. The distractions don\u2019t give me brief emotion, just stop me from thinking about things (which is something I do a lot), and now it is as thought when you shine a light onto a shadow, only to see there is nothing.\n\nThis is also probably the reason I had issues with money, as I could get invested temporarily in one thing, enjoying the distraction, but after a few days, I would become bored again, and I would buy things, often expensive, and the cycle repeated, until my realisation, when the constant new experiences were made redundant. I heard this more or less summed up, in the episode of Killing Eve with the AA meeting (S2 E6 says google) when Oksana talks the second time. To quote:\n\n\u201cMost of the time, most days, I feel nothing. I don't feel anything. It is so boring. I wake up and I think, \"Again? Really? I have to do this again?\" And what I really don't understand is, how come everybody else isn't screaming with boredom too? I'm just trying to find ways of making myself feel something. More and more and more but it doesn't make any difference. No matter what I do, I don't feel anything, I I hurt myself, it doesn't hurt. I buy what I want, I don't want it. I do what I like, I don't I don't like it. I'm just so bored.\u201d\n\nI relate strongly to this, though without the self inflicted hurting (though when it comes from another, verbally, the statement applies)\n\nThere are still a few things that have lasted and remained effective, especially music, but even Schubert is slipping.\n\nI think that eventually this could lead me into drugs or other questionable exploits. If anybody knows what this is, or what I can do, I would appreciate it.\n\nI do have an idea, as it may relate to another condition I have, though I would prefer it if you dm me with your idea, as I don\u2019t really like the idea of everyone knowing about my pre existing condition, even though this is my reusable throwaway account.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I have been dealing with sharp abdominal pain for about a year now. The pain can last from a few hours to a few days and is on the far right side of my abdomen right where my rib cage ends. I went to the ER last June because the pain was constant for over a week. They did an ultrasound, blood work and an MRI. They found nothing. I asked them why the pain is so severe, they couldn't tell me and discharged me with a clean bill of health. Since then and up to 3 months ago, I would also wake up feeling nauseous, gas, burping loose stools and sometimes throwing up, but the pain in my side was minimal almost non-existent.\n\nThe past 3 months, the nausea subsided along with morning sickness but the pain came back and now I also have a lump right on my upper right abdomen directly below/underneath my right rib cage. The lump is not visibly protruding but it can be felt and obviously not normal. The past week the lump seems larger, which has started to effecting my normal activities. If I move the wrong way, sit down to fast, really any quick movement, I feel it popping like its rubbing up against my rib and its very uncomfortable.\n\nThe lump itself is not painful if I apply pressure, but it does move around. When i touch it, I do I can feel it popping in and out. Image below and where my hand is shows exactly where the lump is. From research I've done, it could be my gallbladder, so maybe it's inflamed or swollen. I am 150 lbs and not overweight and have no other health problems.

Sorry for the long post, I am just worried it may be something serious.\n\nOther info: Alcohol is the only thing I can pinpoint that makes the swelling worse along with the pain.\n\nRegarding medications: I take Suboxone, which I've been on maintenance (2mg daily) for 5 years.

I've posted on the subject before, but find that I describe my issue(s) differently, depending on my current health, as there is clearly some neural/cog involvement, so I figured I'd give this another shot.  \n\n\n36 male, 6'5\", 155-210lbs (depending on the day)  \n\n\nI was in absurdly good physical condition when I was 23-24. I could run a marathon without breathing hard, despite smoking a pack a day. At that point, I was 205lbs or so, and extremely physically active. IE: 12 hours of sustained mountain biking was a normal day. I was weight training at the time and had gained a few lbs for the first time in my life.  \n\n\nAt some point around 25, my health went to complete hell. I woke up one morning with zero energy. I needed help at work to get up the half flight of steps to my office, as I was just powering out completely, along with blacking out, and having mad palpitations and tachycardia. It was like a switch. One day I was in extremely good health, and the next, honestly, I know 98 year old people with more endurance.  \n\n\nThere are only 3 or 4 things that I can think of that may have changed just prior to onset.  \n1. I started dating a girl, who had pretty aggressive HSV1. I've always tested negative for it.  \n2. I quit smoking for said girl, two weeks prior to onset of disease.  \n3. I had a pair of wisdom teeth removed, and a short course of antibiotics a few months prior.  \n4. I'd developed Hashimotos about a year prior. (I experienced no lack of energy because of it however, despite my labs showing a TSH of around 180. (roughly 100x reference range).  \n\n\nThe disease hit me like a freight train. I went from running marathons, riding 100km/day, mountain climbing, and weight training, to barely able to walk around the house, stand up doing dishes, etc.  \nThe first thing that was very apparent, was GI issues. I'd get up and have to poop 5-6x before noon. After a few runs to the bathroom, I'd typically mostly pass out at my desk for a few hours, and wake up around 2pm. I just blacked out entirely as my BP dropped through the floor. The GI issues all seem to start around the stomach, and work their way through the entire GI tract over the course of a week or so, and then the cycle resets and goes back to the stomach. Typically, I'd get a day or two between GI cycles, where my eyes would get mad inflamed, itchy, and sometimes start bleeding (right out of the eye-ball).  \nWhenever GI issues were present, I'd have postural orthostatic hyper/hypotension to the point that every time I stand up, I've just trained myself to scan my environment before I get up, because  my vision goes black for the first 5-10 seconds after standing up. When I have tachycardia or palptations while standing, if I crouch down my pulse will go from 150+bpm to EXACTLY 60bpm instantly. No ramp down time. It's 150, and then it feels like we just skip 1.5 beats and now we're at 60bpm. You can set a clock to my heart rate once I crouch down.   \n\n\nThyroid labs have never made sense, nor reflected treatment. I can have a TSH 100x reference range, while simultaneously my T3 and T4 are also HIGH, or high T3 with below reference T4, with just above reference TSH, or any other combination. A few years back, I was on 180mg/day of dessicated Thyroid (docs orders) and was having extreme anxiety and constant panic attacks, as well as I lost 30lbs. But because my T3/T4 were slightly low and TSH was slightly high, docs all insisted I increase my Thyroid dose. I eventually completely gave up on docs, stopped taking the thyroid hormone entirely for a few months, and then checked labwork. T3/T4 were undetectable, and TSH back up to 180, so I started back on 60mg/day and within' a month, that brought my labs back to exactly where they were when I was on 180mg/d. My labs NEVER reflect my doseage, and rarely reflect symptoms.  \n\n\nSmoking. \\*sigh\\*. If I smoke less than I naturally feel like I want to (or I quit for months or years), I die. I'm in the ER every single day with what seems like a heart attack, but no one's ever figured out what's going on. If instead, I smoke exactly the amount I feel I want to, severity and frequency of all symptoms decreases dramatically. I'm currently smoking way more than I want to, as another test, and for the first time in 6 years, I've been back on both my bikes, as well as lifting weights. Things I absolutely haven't been able to do  at any time that I wasn't smoking tobacco.  \nNicotine supplementation has no affect. It must be tobacco, and it must be enough to guarantee I'm going to die from some smoking related disease, but at this point, I have to conclude that it's better to be functional now and die soon, than to be non-functional for the rest of my life.  \n\n\nI have a plethora of diagnostic markers for broad, systemic inflammation and vasculitis (undifferentiated, and not investigated). My CBC's always look very strange, with WBC's/Neutriphils always at the bottom of reference range.  \n\n\nFood:\n\nThis is the big problem. I eat nothing other than pork sausages, potatos, blueberries, green onions, and coconut oil/protein. Everything else consistently kills me, so I've just learned to avoid everything. According to IgG/IgE tests, I'm allergic to pretty near everything, quite severely. According to prick tests, I have no allergies at all, despite being very obviously reactive to grasses, pollens, and cats. (they don't show up on prick test at all, but if I bring in a sample myself, its' reactive).  \nI can only physically process the absolute minimum food required to barely make my basal caloric requirement on most days, so I am force feeding myself, and have been for the past 6 or 7 years. The above food list is what I've eaten for the past 4 years. I have eaten nothing else. Every time I've tried a little infant sized bite of a vegetable, my gut hurts for a few weeks and I have no energy.  \n\n\nI've been given 50 different diagnoses over the years, and every single doctor I've seen has told me the previous doctor was completely wrong, and then gives me a new diagnoses. Every single one of them hasn't made any sense as there were simply too many obvious confounding variables and diagnostics to rule it out.  \nSome type of Lupis is the most likely, but again, for every type that'd fit, I have at least one diagnostic to rule it out.  \nLyme disease fits perfectly, but what the fuck doesn't Lyme disease fit perfectly, according to the Lymies?  \n\n\nVery open to suggestions. Here in Canada, we have very limited access to diagnostics. Myself personally, for some reason, seem to have an extra difficult time getting access to diagnostic bloodwork, and especially imaging. I've had multiple vertebral herniations for over a decade, and it took 10 years to convince a doctor to get me an MRI to confirm ONE of them. I only confirmed the rest because the imaging tech took pity on me and checked, even though it wasn't ordered. I've never had any GI investigation done. I've been trying to see a gastroenterologist for 12 years, but the only one I've managed to get an appt. with, wore his sunglasses and bar-star clothes for our entire 1 minute, 22 second meeting, after which he told me to buy some probiotics from his store. I told him I'd already tried that exact brand. He told me he had no other suggestions.  \n\n\nI strongly suspect that this will end up being solved by a med student, as I've just not really met any (practising) physicians who have any interest in complex diagnostics. Hell, I can't even get a family GP because they all say they're too busy to deal with any complex cases. Figure this out and just consider you student loans paid.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

In my first sexual relationship I was unable to sustain an erection but that mostly got better once I went to a doctor and started receiving Sertraline for anxiety/depression. That did not change the feeling of discomfort from having my penis touched.\n\nIn the couple of times I've had sex since, I did not ejaculate, and duration of intercourse was generally determined by how long I was able to maintain an erection and mitigate my discomfort. I wore a condom each time. Contact between my penis and my partner's hand or mouth was especially uncomfortable, bordering on painful.\n\nDuration of the problem is a little hard for me to pin down since I've only been sexually active for about a year and a half, but I did have a partner when I was younger who put her hand on it and I remember the same feeling of strong discomfort. I've never really felt an urge to masturbate, and I didn't start trying until recently, when I encountered these problems, but the results were initially largely the same, difficulty maintaining an erection, or just discomfort until I stopped.\n\nI've only come close to ejaculating twice (outside of wet dreams), and both times led to me passing out. The first time was the only time I was able to masturbate to completion (I did it through a sheet to minimize the sensation). When I started to come, I was left feeling panicky and short of breath, with what just felt like a very urgent need to pee, and when I tried to go the bathroom I passed out on my feet and fell. Got a pretty nasty bump on the head from that one. What little ejaculate did come out left a copper-colored stain.  \nThe second time was during sex, I had a moment where I felt close to starting to come, but it passed. Afterwards, I fell asleep, woke up a few hours later, went to the bathroom, and passed out on the toilet. Hit my head again, but this time I was pooping and sitting down so it wasn't as far of a fall. Still not exactly ideal, and it's hard to keep your partner in the mood when you pass out and loudly fall mid-shit.\n\nAny help or advice on any of the problems (the initial erectile dysfunction, the lack of urges to masturbate, the severe discomfort at having my penis touched, or the passing out) is very much appreciated. It's been hard to maintain romantic relationships when I don't feel like I can be touched and the passing out has me pretty worried.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I am able to move my fingers but they feel stiff because I have to bend my wrist at an odd angle.

I didn't have enough strength to grab it with my left hand using that specific wrist angle and finger placement.

Desperate for answers.", "author": "soupyexcitable", "self_text": "Hi all, \n\nMale, early 30's, 5'11\", 145lbs\n\nHave posted here about this issue before but thought I'd try again after having seen several specialists and several things have been ruled out. \n\nBasically I'm cold almost all of the time. Been like this most of my life to some extent but in the last few years it's gone from an odd and occasional nuisance to a constant plague. My peripheral vascular system just seems to stay in a constricted state, though not to such a severe degree that there is pain, like is seen with Raynaud's disease. Temperature in my apartment stays at least 75F, and it's 78F in here now, but as I type this my hands are cold to the touch and my skin is visibly pale because blood flow is not reaching the surface. My skin complexion is dramatically different when I can, rarely, get warmed up. \n\nIt doesn't last long, but the only things that warm me up is covering up with a blanket, getting exposed to a sudden shift in higher temperature like going outside in the sun when it's warm out, getting into a hot car, taking a very hot shower or bath, etc. Really intense exercise like HIIT can sometimes break Jack Frost's grip, but not always and it goes back to cold again shortly after I finish. I generally keep the A/C off when I'm home alone and if it's warm enough inside I'll be fine. But my significant other is normal and likes not burning up, so the A/C comes on and I go back to shivering. \n\nThis sounds insane to normal people probably, but honestly getting into a hot car when it's 85F+ outside is such a wonderful feeling because I can finally get warm and get warm quickly. I do eventually have to turn on the A/C because even I can get too hot, but I have to be careful because sudden shifts in temperature the other direction will cause the coldness/vasoconstriction to return and it's stubborn as hell to reverse. Going to a grocery store or any office/school building is a real pain because the A/C is always blasting and it's like stepping into an igloo for me. \n\nI do have other symptoms like depression-like mental issues (not convinced it's actually depression though) and general physical fatigue, but since I've had this issue my whole life, only it's gotten worse now, and the other symptoms are more recent, I'm assuming this isn't related. In any case, I'd like to focus on the cold intolerance since it's the most constant thing and is almost literally driving me crazy. \n\nIn the past few months I've seen a new primary care physician, a team of cardiologists, a rheumatologist, and have had many tests done all of which seem to have ruled out hypothyroidism, any cardiovascular issues, and have probably ruled out autoimmune issues being the cause, though I did have 1 out of 3 ANA tests return low positive (titer 1:160). Also, complement C4 was mildly low, 13 mg/dL. But the rheumatologist doesn't think autoimmune issues are the cause of the vasoconstriction and he doesn't seem to want to see me again few a few months at which point they'll rerun the tests. And with only 1 low-positive ANA test and a slew of other tests coming up negative, it's not clear I even have an autoimmune issue. \n\nIt's literally anxiety inducing because I don't like being cold all the time, who would? I don't like looking pale and sickly when I'm out in normal people's element which, in America, always involves A/C blasting away. It's embarrassing to go to shake someone's hand and they visibly recoil because I feel like ice. It makes it really difficult to get up the blood flow/energy to exercise. I'm really just sick of it and tired of not having any answers from my doctors. I don't like being constantly preoccupied with feeling cold and wondering how or if I'm going to be able to get warm, even if for just a few minutes so for a time I don't have to think about it. \n\nWith the most obvious possibilities seemingly ruled out, I'm just at a loss now. I've read a little about hypothalamic disorders possibly causing this, but I suspect there's no easy or cheap test for that? I eat well, I exercise (when I can struggle through the freeze), and I'm skinny but I have a normal BMI. \n\nPlease, at risk of putting people off by sounding so sad and desperate, I really would appreciate -any- and -all- help, advice, suggestions, hypotheses, etc., especially from those trained/educated in a medical profession. There's gotta be some MDs or PhDs here who might read this and be like, aha! Right? Right?? Please help :(", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Didn\u2019t say much about the findings except he was going to give me antibiotics because he suspected pneumonia.\n\nGiven Azithromycin 5-day. Day 2 started feeling much better.

I have arranged a physio appointment with the doctor but I have to wait several weeks and want to ask here in the meantime.\n\nThe pain is not agonizing in itself but leaves me unable to lift anything heavy and is constantly present. It is generally least painful while walking and lying down and worse when sitting or standing still. It is also often worsened by standing after having sat for a long time. The back and neck also make cracking and creaking noises more often than normal, and sometimes I even feel and hear it in the lower skull.\n\nI have been to the doctors twice. The first time I was told to come back in six weeks if it still remains, the second time I was told the same, but after emphasising how long it has lasted the doctor gave a referral for physio. I was really hoping for an MRI in order to find exactly what the problem is because it feels like I'm potentially wasting time that could be spent addressing the real issue.\n\nAt first, it was only lower back pain, but it has recently started to hurt when I turn my neck, and even when not moving it feels stiff. \n\nI believe it started at the gym doing deadlifts. I stopped doing them and squats and for a while, the other exercises seemed fine but after it did not go away I decided to stop lifting completely. It has been about a month and a half with no lifting and it does not seem to be getting much better.\n\nAs for the shoulders, they have been somewhat troubled even before the rest started. They make cracking noises too and feel heavy when moving them up and down as if moving them in and out if place. The left one is worse than the right but they both do it. I do not know if it is related to the rest.\n\nThis is starting to make me feel lazy and depressed. The gym was one of my main pleasures in life and I feel constantly tempted to go back. I tried lighter exercises but even push-ups and using a punching bag aggravate it. Nothing I have found online seems to help, and much of it is about lifting with proper form which, while useful, does not help with the recovery.\n\nI would really appreciate any advice people can give.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I'm 5'4 and swing between 105 and 115 pounds like a seesaw. I'm diagnosed with both pituitary dwarfism and central sleep apnea. I use a CPAP every night, and I took a lot of synthetic growth hormone as a child since my body wasn't producing it. I had a thyroid check done a few years ago (it came back alright), but the rest of those pituitary hormones have been largely untouched. One of my optic nerves is slightly swollen, but after a few brain scans no formal reason for that could be produced.\n\nI've always had problems with headaches, fatigue, and an all around lack of energy. While I can definitely walk in a straight line, I often feel dizzy and unbalanced. Too much physical exertion, i.e. running really fast or lifting heavy objects, tends to trigger some pretty bad headaches. Starting on the CPAP drastically improved these issues, but they're still very much present. Lately, however, it's my breathing that I've been keeping an eye on. With an increasing frequency, I've been noticing chest pains - like there's a big weight sitting there; the muscles feel sore in a similar way your arms might feel post workout. That, along with occasional fluttering or feelings of an accelerated heartbeat. My breathing has also been feeling more labored. I can breathe just fine, but it feels increasingly heavy; like I'm not getting nearly enough air. I can feel my breath reaching my lungs, but it somehow feels shallow. Like I my lungs are only using half the air I give them. I've been told the way I describe it sounds akin to an anxiety disorder, but I notice this issue even when I'm sitting at home, completely calm and relaxed. I also feel as though my headaches have been returning. I used to have them every day, but the CPAP helped reduce them to an occasional event.\n\nCould this somewhat sudden change have to do with apnea? Is there any one pituitary-regulated hormone I could look to? Or is this some completely new development? I know this is kind of vague and there are a lot of different things up in the air with this. Unfortunately with my own research, it looks like there are no decent studies on central sleep apnea in people younger than 60, and very little research in pituitary dwarfism that isn't specifically done for children with stunted growth. I would go to a doctor directly, but as it turns out, 21 is the age that my dad's insurance company kicks out dependents. So as of about two months ago, I'm uninsured.... Definitely rushing on getting that back online, but in the meantime the internet is kind of my best bet. My symptoms, though they cause me a lot of issues, are so vague and don't really have a whole lot of 'evidence' so doctors in the past have just kind of been shrugging and saying 'get more sleep I guess'.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

To add a background, most of this started around age 14 and has gotten worse with age. I've had my blood drawn twice this year, and each time the ANA comes back positive with a speckled pattern.

I saw a rheumatologist recently, but he was very dismissive and extremely rude, cutting me off midsentence, refusing to make eye contact, and basically rushing me out of his office. He even laughed at my doctor for referring me(probably thought I was just a pill seeker). I know a positive ANA is to be taken as suggestive, rather than conclusive; but the fact that I have had ongoing symptoms worsening in severity is concerning to me. I dont believe this could be some sort of somaticized pain. Perhaps all of this isn't even related, but\n\nNotable symptoms include:\n\n*Spasming in the upper and lower back, including shoulders, with burning pain that worsens when lifting and bending.\n\n*Shooting, electric shock type pain in arms, fingers, eyes, legs, and feet.\n\n*Mild hair loss\n\n*Loud ringing in ears\n\n*Poor coordination in hands and feet\n\n*Sore spots on the hips and arms\n\n*Wideapread bruises with no known cause\n\n*Tongue and facial twitches\n\n*Pins and needles in hands and feet\n\n*Dulled numbing in hands\n\n*Burning sensation in certain parts of skin \n\n*2 to 3 day long migraines \n\n*Frequent coughing and throat infections \n\n*Debilitating fatigue\n\n*Joint pain in knees and hips", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I've been relatively healthy for the 5 weeks I've been here until now. One of my housemates got sick with a bacterial throat infection (they didn't do a strep test, but I'm assuming was strep) and had to get antibiotics for it. Then of course the day before I moved out of the house, I started feeling fevery and had a sore throat and neck. I started feeling sick 4 days ago. At first I was sure that I was also getting strep. I was having chills and hot flashes and felt generally delirious. The throat hasn't been bad enough where I can't swallow or talk. The tongue has been white. I don't have good enough lighting to see my throat, plus I have a terrible gag reflex. I had mucous in my throat and since I have a gag reflex bad, I threw up a few times just from that. No appetite the first few days.\n\nI am tempted to think that I am getting better, though. Yesterday I had no fever symptoms and was even singing without thinking about it. I almost felt back to normal, I had an appetite. But toward the end of the night my throat was sore again. And in the mornings I have mucous. I'm wondering how long this might go on. Usually when I get a sore throat it spirals into a sinus infection since I get them chronically. But thus far it's only been the throat and fever, no congestion or cough or anything, so it's strange to me. I do think I am dehydrated, though, I'm not urinating as much as usual.\n\nI won't be back in the USA/eligible to use my health insurance for another 2 weeks, which sucks. I was staying with a family and at a school that recommended a clinic, but now I'm in another city alone until I leave. So far I've only been taking Mucinex and Ibuprofen. The family gave me a giant aceitamenophen one night, I have no idea the dosage, but the pill was huge. Is there any other medicine I should consider or dosage? Is it fair to say it's not strep?\n\nThank you so much!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Maybe someone here can?", "author": "organicpaprika", "self_text": "Age: 21\nFemale\n5'1\" , 180 lbs\nblack\nUSA\nEhlers Danlos Syndrome\nCurrently on birth control\nLiterally my entire life, but especially in the last 4 years.\n\nSo here's the gist:. I've always had joint pain, and it's just getting worse with time. Over the last four years:\n\n* I started having weird \"flare ups\" where my t-zone of my face and the corners of my mouth start to melt off. **The skin dies, then peels and flakes until I bleed**. Never any sores inside my mouth, just the corners on the outside, the area on the crease of my nose, the top of my nose, and under my eyes on my cheek bones. Bright red, then dead.\n\n*  **I've always been really nauseous in the mornings**, especially once high school started as a kid. In college it got bad enough that I've started **vomiting, usually at least once a week.** It sucks a ton, usually happening on my walk to the bus stop, on the bus, or once I get to work. I've tried not eating, eating, eating high-sugar foods, low sugar foods. Fodmap, dairy free (both for a month each), and gluten free for the past month. Nothing has stopped the vomiting, or the fact that it gets way worse during one of the aforementioned flare ups.\n\n* **Hemorrhoids, mucus in my stool, and poop of all shades and consistencies.** I've been diagnosed by a gastroenteroligist with IBS-D, but even he said that doesn't explain the vomiting. I had a colonoscopy and endoscopy done and nothing was found. I am now regularly finding blood on my toilet paper (bright red from the hemorrhoids I'm guessing), and my poop during a flare up is basically black. I always have a ton of mucus floating around. I know, it's gross. \n\n* Twice in my life I have gone an entire month **unable to eat anything, throwing everything up** Both lasted a month (once in 2017 and again around the same time of year in 2019). I tried everything, including liquid Boost, pediasure, gatorade, and Soylent. When food logging, I found I was throwing up foods I had attempted to eat 12 hours prior, largely undigested. In both cases, eventually I just was able to eat again, after basically starving for 4 weeks.\n\n* I have **constant diarrhea.** On the Bristol Stool Scale, my poop is at the very least a 6 on a good day. I'm going a minimum of 3 times a day, usually within an hour of eating a meal. I cannot hold it, and have pooped my pants as an adult. During a flare up, it's a Type 7-- liquid. I'm currently in a flare, and sad to say that I thought I was passing gas and dripped onto the floor rather significantly. I had to take the day off of work, as shortly after abdominal pain started up again (this is a usual occurrence) and I couldn't leave the toilet.\n\n* **Joint pain, everywhere.** Every joint. Due to my Ehlers Danlos I pop out of socket quite often, and have to wear braces at night to prevent further subluxations. However, I get pain even in joints that are subluxating, and it gets substantially worse during a flare. My knees swell enough that people notice, and it has gotten the point of making me dependent on OTC pain medication for arthritis to get through the day. I stopped taking it 3 flares ago, because my doctor didn't want me to damage my kidneys or liver this young. So now I just have to stay bed-ridden on the really bad days. I have cried before on the subway due to the pain of the cab stopping on my ankles and wrists. But when I'm not in a flare I go hiking, run, do my physical therapy no problem, etc. I'm *very* active when I'm okay (objectively; I use a smart watch that logs me in the top 5% of its users by step count).\n\n* I'm also getting real fluctuating blood pressure, and have always had weird blood sugar. Even after eating, the highest my blood sugar gets is usually 105. I had a donut and sweetened iced tea earlier because I was light headed and seeing stars (despite eating normally), but a dunkin donuts was the closest thing to me. An hour and a half afterward my reading was 97 mg/dL. **The lowest I've got it at is 74mg/dL, just after midnight in April.** I've been tested for diabetes several times, and they've never even flagged anything. I requested to be tested specifically for diabetes 4 years ago, and the test was negative. **My blood pressure, on average, is high. ** Today I got light headed sitting down, and BP measured 153/97. I wasn't stressed (was just doing laundry), and my average for 1st-thing in the morning readings over the past month is 125/75 (which I understand is high for a woman of my age). It's been like this even when I was 30 pounds lighter. It's been high enough that nurses have remarked on the machine \"probably being the problem\" and then doing it manually to find the same results.\n\nI've been to:\n\n* A pediatrician who gave up and told me it was normal.\n\n* A primary doctor internist who told me to go to a psychologist. The psychologist then told me that it was absolutely not a mental issue and recommended I change doctors.\n\n* Another primary doctor who thought it was MCAS. The low-histamine diet did not help either. \n\n* A gastroenterologist who told me to try FODMAP, again. I did-- it didn't help any more the second time than it had the first. \n\n* A second gastro who did the colonoscopy/endoscopy and said IBS + he didn't know what was causing the vomiting. Found nothing in the scopes. The vomiting stopped on it's own again, and he recommended trying antacids. I've tried tums, zantac, and omeprazole for about a month with no improvement in my constant nausea. \n\n* An allergist who said I was allergic to corn, soy, all nuts, sunflower seeds, and coconuts. I avoided those for almost a year, but again had a flare up later on. When returning, my skin tests no longer said I was allergic to the other things.\n\n* An immunologist who said FODMAP again-- I did not try it a third time. \n\n\nI'm at the end of my rope. I've spent years being bounced from doctor to doctor who have no idea what's going on, and in turn kinda give up on me. I've been offered opioids, neuro-pain blockers they said would give me brain fog, and all kinds of other meds to address my pain symptoms, but everyone just kinda shrugs at my gastrointestinal distress. I can't live like this anymore. I'm not suicidal or anything, I'm just finding it near impossible to live a normal quality of life as I am.\n\nEven if you don't know what's wrong with me, if anyone has gone through something similar and has advice / some kind of regimen that worked for them, please let me know. I've tried FODMAP, gluten free, dairy free, corn free, carb free, vegetarian, high fiber, keto, and literally going on an all-liquid diet (soylent and keto chow) over the past 4 years. Nothing has worked, and I've given all of them an honest shot for at least a month each. Please let me know if you've got some advice.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

It doesn't hurt and it works just fine, but when I slowly close and open my hand, I feel a popping sensation that has a bit of \"pain\" but not to the degree where it hurts.

Over the next year, I seemed to have an increasing amount of same sex fantasies and less hetero ones. This has gotten worse over time and I was finding myself drawn back over the last year from my boyfriend, both sexually and intimately. It's not that I find him unattractive or anything, but it's like I have no desire to do any of the things we always did like hand holding or cuddling or making out or sex. The last six months we've almost done zero intimate things and I know it's hurting him (he knows all of this). Could it be the spironolactone or some other external factor? In the last six months I got a full time job and I'm tired a lot of the time which probably doesn't help. I can't seem to find anything online saying that high estrogen / low testosterone corresponds with more same-sex fantasies or lack of intimacy (though I do see lack of sex drive, but I still have a sex drive, just... for girls).

Nothing was detected and the Zoloft didn't help.\n\nSo fast forward until about a month ago I got a message my landlord asking if I have seen an increase in my gas bill or smelt any kind of gas leak. I told her the gas I received in March for the previous 3 months was up about 30% but I assumed it was just because I was using more gas. Then 2 weeks ago I got my bill back for the previous 3 months and it had literally tripled. They had a maintenance person come out and he said that the gas leak was coming from my apartment and they finally fixed it. So I think I've finally found out what my symptoms are being caused by. I went back to my doctor and told him about it and he sent me to the hospital to get a Blood Gas Analysis this week. They came back and my doctor said he said he wasn't too familiar with the results so he sent me off to a Pulmonary specialist. So I've got a 3 week gap until I can get in and see the Pulmonary specialist. Since the leak was fixed and I've aired out my apartment 2 weeks ago I've seen slight improvements for the first time. But I didn't get the Blood gas Analyse test done until about 2 weeks after they fixed the leak.\n\nI'm certain my symptoms have to do with the gas leak and hopefully I'm finally recovering. I just wanted to know if anyone is familiar with Blood gas analyses and if they they think my symptoms were likely caused by the chronic methane exposure and if they will continue to improve now that my exposure has stopped.\n\nI've posted my results here.

The three diagnoses were ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids, or a miscarriage. My PCP also said it might just be a fluke because I'd been very ill recently (see \"additional background\" below). I don't know enough about cysts and fybroids to know if a substantial change like this is normal. I have a GYN appointment coming up now (so I'll hopefully have an answer soon), but I wanted to know other people's opinions as well.\n\nNormal periods for me: I normally don't have many (if any) symptoms normally associated with periods. I have never gotten tender breasts, I rarely pass any clots (generally small and infrequently), rarely have cramps (usually mild and only last the first day, and have a light flow (1 regular always brand tampon is enough for me for 8 hours on my heavy days). I also have only had 1 period that lasted longer than 5 days in my life.\n\nAdditional background: I was diagnosed with mono, and due to the stress that my body was under for the previous 10 weeks related to that, I did miss a couple of periods. I became sexually active (after years of not being) almost exactly three weeks ago. We used condoms every time but one less than a week ago (he did pull out though). I am 24.\n\nThis period: I had spotting about a week before I really started to bleed which is abnormal for me. My breasts also started to get sore around this time. I never took a pregnancy test because I didn't think the odds of me being pregnant were high enough to do that because I didn't really have any symptoms. 4 days ago my \"period\" started. I started to get cramps that were more painful than usual and chalked it up to having had sex recently (I know orgasm can cause period cramps to worsen) and put in a regular tampon like I normally would. I bled through that fairly quickly and put in a \"super\" tampon before bed that night to be sure. The next day, I bled through a regular tampon in about an hour, which is extreme for me (about 8-10 times normal). I then bought and put in a \"super plus\" tampon and bled through that in a couple of hours. I have been using a combination of super plus tampons and extra absorbent pads (to catch what leaks out of the tampon, because that is still happening) and can now wait about 4 hours between super plus tampon changes. This is now day 4, and the flow hasn't changed much. I have also been having the worst cramps of my life from day 1, and it is starting to drain me because they're pretty much constant, and they do get worse from time to time. I have also passed many clots, most of which were about the size of a US half dollar.\n\nI guess I'm wondering if I'm crazy or if this sounds like a miscarriage. I've been miserable and in pain for a few days now and after looking at symptoms of fibroids and cysts there are symptoms I don't have (although I know not everyone will have every symptom), but seemingly everything lines up with a very early miscarriage.

Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}
