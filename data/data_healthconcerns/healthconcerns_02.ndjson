Every time I hold my nose to breathe out it feels like something is blocking my ears. When I wince it sort of feels like I can feel something move inside my ear. Also I can't drink alcohol or a lot of it without feeling nauseous or having a weird feeling in my head/body. I feel like I'm running at 50% and get tired quickly and generally don't feel like my energetic self. \n\nIt started back in early November and it felt like my left ear was suddenly really stuffed. I was worried I might have an ear infection but it calmed down after a couple days and went away soon after. However, the feeling of pressure in my head and congestion in my ears remained. \n\nSince it seemed like things were settling down after the first couple days I figured it would all eventually go away but it didn't. Every time I felt a bit better I would go to the gym and work out but not feel 100% but try to push through then feel like complete shit the next day and my symptoms would be worst again. \n\nI then went to a physician in early December who looked in my ears and said she saw a lot of congestion. She figured I had a sinus infection and gave me amoxicillin and some decongestants. At first this gave me a bit of relief and I could feel some of my energy levels coming back after being in a malaise for several weeks. But after a couple days it didn't really feel like it was fixing anything. I continued the course to the end but it definitely wasn't doing anything. I went to do acupuncture and that helped me feel a bit better but I still had this feeling of a weight inside my head and when i try to pop my ears it feels like something is blocking them. I had to go overseas for a few weeks and wasn't able to see a doctor. I got quite sick around new years (chills/headache) and that made the pressure in my head a lot worst for a couple days but then it all calmed down and went back to its normal state of just everything feeling mildly shit/lack of energy. \n\nUp on returning to the states I went to see an ENT and the doctor checked both my ears and my sinuses and saw nothing wrong with them. He gave me a decongestant and it doesn't really seem to be working. I've gone back to acupuncture this week and normally when I do it i feel euphoric and get a great rest, it is evident while I'm doing it now that something in my system is blocking it from working properly. \n\nI'm at complete loss as to what is causing this constant mild but annoying pressure headache and feeling of stuff in my ears. It feel like I can taste a bit of mucus coming down the back of my throat but generally not a lot. Since the acupuncture this week I've felt a bit more. It  just feels like there's a knot in my head and my system can't clear it.\n\nIf anyone has any recommendations on what to do I would love to hear them bc I'm at a loss as to what is going on with me as I was certain i still had a minor sinus infection that hadn't cleared but apparently not. Generally my symptoms are not as pronounced as they were back in December but they are still bothering me and I still don't have as much energy as I'm used to. Every morning I wake up with the same malaise and it's frustrating. I realize nobody will probably be able to figure this out online but I figured it was worth a shot. I'm wondering if I need to do a lot of running or something to kick my system into overdrive and reboot it? I know that sounds crazy but it feels like something is caught in my head and won't budge.

So, just a four hours ago, the neighborhood feral cat lightly scratched my hand. The cat is pretty chill, no obvious signs of illness or anything. The cat does not behave oddly at all. It turns out that one of the neighbors actually takes it in to the vet for check ups and shots. However, this cat belongs to no one. It can wander around and come back as it pleases. \n\nThe cat was pretty much asleep before it scratched me. So, the chance that there was wet saliva on its nails is very low in my opinion. It was laying on a warm scarf that we keep on top of the water heater, so it was in a dry environment as well. The scratch drew a bit of blood.  I immediately washed my hand with soap and water. Then, I poured 91% alcohol all over it and rubbed it in vigorously. Next, I wiped it with a packaged antiseptic wipe. Finally, I slathered triple antibiotic (bacitracin, neomycin, &amp; polymyxin-B) all over it. The tiny scratches are a bit red and a bit swollen, but it doesn't really have an alarming appearance.\n\nHere's the kicker... I got vaccinated today for yellow fever and typhoid on the same arm as the scratch. So, it was already sore. However, I feel like after the scratching incident, my wrist started to hurt. Honestly, it is hard to remember if it started before or after. Sort of just in one spot on the side of my wrist. I do not have reduced motion, and it just kind of pulses with a light pain every few minutes or so and then immediately goes away. I can't purposefully bring the pain back (i.e. by rotating my hand around, applying pressure, etc.). So, I can't tell if the pain is from the shots or from the scratch. I'd be surprised to learn that I would have pain symptoms about 4\" away from the wound within an hour or so of the incident...\n\nI dug around the internet for possible causes related to the scratch, and I only find Cat Scratch Disease and Rabies, which do not seem to fit.

I obsessively googled how to prepare for a nuclear attack, what to do when a bomb hits, how high are the possibilities that we'll go into war soon, how to protect yourself from radiation and things like that.

Please forgive me if I misuse medical terminology, I'm trying to articulate this as best as I can based on what I've been reading, but am not a medical doctor. \n\nAt times, they will freeze for several seconds up to a few minutes, staring into space. During this time they are unresponsive to audio or visual stimuli (shouting their name, waving hand in front of the eyes). Their posture is stiff, they do not blink, but breathing and balance seem normal. The episodes can be quite dramatic. For example, freezing mid-way through a sentence, with a glass half raised to drink. After \"coming out\" of a freezing episode, they are momentarily disoriented (&lt;1 second), are unaware of having frozen, but remember what they were saying/doing beforehand.\n\nMy first guess was some sort of seizure. There is loss of consciousness and postural freezing. There is no amnesia, fatigue or other abnormalities after an episode. I've not seen any clonic, tonic, atonic, or autonomic components. One episode was accompanied by what might be automatism. However, the fact that the episodes can be ended with touch or otherwise disrupting the frozen posture, doesn't seem consistent with a seizure based on my understanding. I've found \"motor freezing\" as a symptom of Parkinson's, but from what I read that isn't typically accompanied by loss of consciouses. \n\nThe presentation doesn't seem consistent with psychogenic seizures. In particular, the abrupt and unpredictable onset, the absolute precision with which the frozen posture is maintained, and the absolute unresponsiveness to audiovisual stimuli, seems to be a real neurological abnormality.

I have bloating and gas as well, and the stomach area seems to be bigger than normal. I have discomfort and minor pain when I'm finished eating in the area right under my ribs. I would say that the discomfort isn't localized in one area but more of a crescent shape all throughout the area under my ribs. Occasionally there's a very minor and dull pain in the back of my right side. When I'm hungry the stomach area feels heavy and looks slightly bigger than normal.\n\nKnow what tests I should take?

I\u2019m a US Caucasian female 47.  My kids, some of them, do too. We once thought it was having antibacterial soap on our hands when we applied contacts. That may be \u2014 a physical contact reaction. This morning, I suspect it happened to me because I soaked my contact lenses in the super strong contact solution that has hydrogen peroxide in it. You let them sit six hours or overnight and the hydrogen peroxide becomes inert. I definitely waited overnight but I didn\u2019t rinse them before I put them in my eyes. I usually don\u2019t.  That could explain this morning.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think that explains when I was younger and the perhaps hereditary disposition.  So today I have decided to ask Reddit.\n\nI remember my mother rolling my hair in her bathroom when I was in sixth grade and not being able to keep my eyes open under the so-called Hollywood lights. \n\nAt 16, I was driving and had to pull over because my eyes would not stay open. It\u2019s like a sharp ache and I cannot keep the eyelids open.  I have several times driven while holding one of my eyes open with my fingers. That\u2019s been a long time. But the point is how unable I am to open my eyes voluntarily.\n\nResting the eyes and turning off all the lights aids recovery. The recovery can be as short as half hour to as long as half a day.\n\nThe occurrences are rare, from once a year to every other year. In fact, I don\u2019t remember the last time this happened to me. But it\u2019s happened to my children at least once a year while they are in their 20s. \n\nWhen it happens, it is debilitating until the eyes will open again, as you might expect.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

This is troubling and worrying for me as I'm in college and well I need to study for exams/quizzes and if I can't recall or have trouble recalling information I would do poorly but also just the fact of not being able to remember stuff well as I did before is frightening.\n\nAlso, I've noticed that my mood has changed. Previously I felt with more energy and more outgoing but now I have felt with lack of motivation (like lethargic). For example, I would always feel pumped or sing and listen to music but now I don't feel like I need to or interested in. Another is that I previously felt horny and/or had a high sex drive but now rarely. I do have to say that I have been sleeping more than before though.\n\nSide note: I recently went to the doc about this and got a blood analysis however the results won't come in until Tuesday as her thought it could be something with Vitamin levels or hormone levels.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

Currently, have a diagnosis of PCOS that I have had since I was 15, and on birth control for the past month for it, along with Vitamin D3 supplements. I've had a deficiency of the latter for a long, long time (They first noticed it three years ago, I think I was at 12 ng/mol then, I got prescribed supplements. This December, bloodwork turned up a level of 7. currently on supplements of 60,000 IU twice a week for that). Also sub-clinical hypothyroid, that one doctor thought was causing my 'PCOS-like symptoms' and another dismissed completely as a non-issue. lactose intolerant, although idk if that is relevant. Recently a different brand of birth control caused extremely painful (a 7 for pain for 5-6 days) cramping, and excessive bleeding on my period. I felt like someone had filled my uterus with water in the month preceeding that period. Changed formulations, and waiting to see if this month is any different. \n\nThe main issue here isn't that though. The last year or so, I have been getting sicker (and taking sick-leaves) much more than I used to. \n\nMy body aches constantly- lower back pain, my knees, shoulders, arms. Nothing has ever bruised or swollen. It just hurts. \n\nI've had tinnitus for about a year now- it gets really bad sometimes, and then just disappears. It has absolutely nothing to do with how stressed I am. I complained of my right ear hurting a while back, it also felt full, a doctor recommended an audiometry that was clean, and medication for the tinnitus that didn't work. She mentioned that she noticed some 'nerve irritation', whatever that means. recently, I've noticed the pain and the pressure has shifted to the other side. After a little bit of exploration, I've realized what actually hurts is my TMJ joint, and through it my ears. My jaw clicks all the time and this weekend I don't know what I did but I heard a 'pop' and my jaw's been hurting mildly, but constantly ever since. the pain gets worse whenever I bite/chew. I don't grind my teeth so that's not it. meanwhile, the rest of my body hurts horribly. I held onto a 5-8 pound bag for a couple hours while traveling and the pain the next day was so bad I couldn't get dressed. I might not be at my physical peak, but I am an active person in general. That should not have hurt that bad, at all. Also, the fatigue is horrible. I'm a student, I'm used to a 2.5 hour long commute one-way, all nighters for days in a row, a decently active lifestyle, and getting work done at all hours and places. In the past month or so, I can't get out of bed after 14 hours of sleep. A single day of commuting exhausts me so much I feel like I might have to take a day off to recover. My ability to work and be productive has been horribly affected.  I'd say I was depressed and that it was the birth control but I've been depressed before and I know how to cope with no medication. This isn't that. \n\nMy GP reprimanded me for knowing which brand of anti-histamines I prefer. Insinuated I was making some of it up. Hasn't responded to me wanting to get my ears examined again. I don't really know who I should see (what type of doctor) about this, and what I should do. I just need a direction I can go in.\n\nHelp. I'm pretty exhausted, and out of options.

I wiggled my jaw back and forth for a few minutes and eventually i got it back to before.  \nFor the next few months, if I ever opened my mouth wide enough (think: \"taking a bite out of an apple\"-size opening of mouth) then that bone would get stuck again, and I would have to wiggle around again to get the bone back in place. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast-forward a few more months (maybe \\~3 or 4 months have passed by now from initial symptoms showing up), I suddenly no longer had that jaw issue, and it has been perfectly fine to this day.

There may be multiple things going on, rather than just one issue.\n\nI've been really struggling with noticeable fatigue and lethargy for years now, its ongoing and doesn't improve in any times or circumstances. It prevents me from living a happy, comfortable life and doing the things I want. I get migraines all the time which include an excruciating headache pain with nausea, sometimes vomiting. As well as this, I feel like I have a constant headache that just doesn't go. Dizziness is another issue, every time I stand up I get dizzy, but this also occurs when I'm lying down too. Another factor is my intolerance to heat, I'm always boiling hot, and get extremely tired with heat. These physical issues make everyday life a real strain.\n\nMentally, I have a real issue with concentrating and my memory is so bad it makes me upset or angry. With all of this difficulty, it then makes me feel depressed.\n\nAs well as the above, I also suffer from IBS with excessive gas. Things like coffee almost instantly give me diarrhoea. I also have a complete lack of libido. Another thing I've noticed is my neck hangs forward.\n\nSadly, a year ago I was diagnosed with a cancer, I had intensive chemotherapy for weeks which worked, and I've been clear for over a year. Unfortunately this has seems to have made all of the above symptoms much worse.\n\nI'm back and forth to my GP and I'm told over and over that there's nothing they can do or they don't know. I'm commonly told I'm just depressed and offered antidepressants. At the moment I keep getting told that all of my symptoms are because I've had chemotherapy and it will take time to get over them, however they are ignorant of the fact that I've had this ongoing for years, but has worsened. When I had chemotherapy I lost all my hair but it came back quickly after. A year later, I have noticed for over a month now that lots of my hair is falling out in the shower every day. My hair seems dry and brittle, it would be odd if this was related to the chemo.\n\nOnly other thing I thought I'd mention is that I have constant ear pain. I've learned to tolerate it now, along with the tinnitus. But it affects my life. My GP will keep telling me my ears are full (they always are, can't get rid of it) or that one is infected. But the symptoms are ongoing.\n\nAll of the above are affecting my social life and my work life pretty badly at the moment, and I'm struggling to tolerate it all anymore. I'm motivated to do something about it, find out exactly what's gong on, get to the cause of it all and feel like a normal human being should!\n\nI have had blood tests every so often which all appear normal. A few months ago I had a blood test that tested testosterone which was normal. I also get my blood pressure checked when I'm at the doctors and they say its fine. I also had a CT on my head months ago which was fine.\n\nI'm not sure what else I can do as I keep getting turned away by my GP or just told I'm depressed, get over it. Can anyone please offer me some advice, perhaps give me a clue as to what the cause of these issues are and how I can find a way forward?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nMy bio:\n\n32, male, 6ft2, 13st, white, UK.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

It makes me scared to drive, I never go anywhere without a GPS. ex: I only need to take 2 lefts and 1 right to go from home and arrive at \u2018example destination\u2019. I do not know how to get back home from there. I would probably attempt to take 2 lefts and 1 right trying to get home again, which of course would not be correct. \nI also can\u2019t remember streets or highways as hard as I try- it just doesn\u2019t stick and i get embarrassed when people ask me if I know where \u201cx location\u201d is and i never have any clue. \n\n\u2022 I get very confused when people say clockwise and counterclockwise. I think I understand it fine UNTIL someone tells me to perform a physical action clockwise or counterclockwise. \n\n**I have been diagnosed with mild-moderate ADD but these seem different from ADD symptoms**", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Methane Dominant with combined PPM hovering around 30-40ppm and highest its 70\n\nBackground on my symptoms- Hello all! So I have been having crazy abdominal bloating and gas for almost 2 month now. My stomach was in a weird place around Thanksgiving (but passed) and then after my company holiday party (where I drank way to many whiskeys and had way to many cigarettes). I had about a full week of the craziest bloating I ever had after eating anything. It was literally a week of non stop bloating, with some nausea, heartburn and pain in my lower right back area. I went to the ER after my pain became unbearable, and they performed a CT Scan along with a few blood tests. Everything came out normal. During the second week, things def got better, but I still had a lot of bloating and gas after eating. I made an appt to a GI and they scheduled me for an Endoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy (which I did on Jan 2nd) and everything looked normal there as well. Finally, the doc asked me to take a Breath test for SIBO, which (in his opinion) came back positive. He mentioned the test looked very strange, almost to the point where he wasnt sure I was positive, but said he'd like to start me on antibiotics to see how I react. **Please let me know if you guys would like me to post my SIBO results.** He prescribed me Neomycin and Cipro which did nothing (finished them last week). He now says he's not sure what else we can do but test for it again to see if there were any changes, so Im going to test myself again this weekend. Its a bit strange in the last few days, I woke up 3 days ago with a sharp feeling in my abdominal region, right below the center of my rib cage, that sometimes transitions to the right side, right under my rib cage. The bloating has actually decreased, but the sharper pain is there and Ive been gassy.\n\nId also like to add Ive had NO diarrhea this entire time, no real constipation or anything stool related. I had bright red blood poop at the very start of the symptoms twice, but after examination the doc said thats hemorrhoids.\n\nSome background on me - I normally eat very well and healthy, work out all the time, and have scaled back even more in these recent weeks. I have been VERY limited on sugar, no alcohol, gluten (almost none), dairy (none), and been doing about 75%-80% low Fodmap ever since I've started experiencing all of this. Dont feel like this has really changed anything\n\nSome background on what I think this might be, plus some random facts -\n\n* I have a cat who has been having diarrhea and vomiting since Xmas time. We are in process of figuring out whats wrong with her as well. She has actually gotten this all around the house and we've been doing what we can to clean it\n* Might be TMI, but could oral sex have something to do with it? (me performing on my girlfriend). Ive commented it might taste like a UTI, but dont believe she has one. Coincidentally the sharp pain in my stomach started the morning after oral sex. I read this could do something like a parasite or H. pylori?\n* I did 2 bouts of Accutane, one about 10 years ago, and one about 4 years ago. About 6 months each time\n* I got Sinus surgery in Sept of last year, and took some antibiotics for it.

It is incredibly stressful, as is my job. I have not liked my job for years. During this project, my boss has commented numerous times that I am incredibly disorganized as of late, and keeps asking me why, because it is very much unlike me. During periods of this time, I will admit that I have definitely been depressed - going so far as calling in sick for two days and only getting out of bed to go to the bathroom or eat, which is out of the ordinary for even depressed me; typically, even if I'm thinking it'd be easier to attempt suicide than drag myself in to work, I still have gone.   \n\n\nIn the last few months, I have noticed that I become forgetful about things that I should not be forgetful about, and I'll be surprised at myself, but it hasn't gone past being a 'oh that's weird, I wonder why I couldn't remember that' thought. Examples being: doctor's name, restaurant names, I can't remember what I was talking about in the middle of a sentence, names of brands, names of songs, if I bought groceries that week, if I paid my bills, etc. This is all pretty normal things to not remember, so I've brushed it off...what has surprised is the magnitude of how often it has happened. I understand I'm 'aging', but I don't think it's normal for a 20-something person to forget things enough that they realize something is off.  \n\n\nI've started having to write notes to myself via email, in the note app on my phone, or scheduling things in my calendar of reminders of things I want to buy, if I already paid a bill so I don't pay twice, if I haven't paid a bill, songs that I like to add to Spotify lists, write a note to remind myself I locked the door to the house, etc.  \n\n\nIn the last few weeks this has escalated, as my stress level has, to being large things. Remember the project I'm talking about above? The one that has been the bane of my existence since October? I completely forgot it existed. A co-worker emailed me about it, I walked into my boss's office and was like \"What in the world is this about?\"...she looked at me like I had lost my mind. Then she started yelling at me about my disorganization and 'how could I not remember this project', and in the most disgusted tone '*what is wrong with you*'. At this point, I lie and laugh, 'Oh God this is definitely a Monday, I remember this project, ignore me, I'm so sorry I messed this up'; I had to walk back to my desk and look up in my sent emails to try and figure out what the project was about. Once I re-read my previous emails, I remembered what it was.   \n\n\nI decided, after this happened, to call a doctor and schedule an appointment for next week. Only when I called, I couldn't remember who I needed to see. I even joked with the receptionist 'well this is ironic isn't it?'. Due to the nature of my call, my doctor actually called me back, talked with me, and said she thinks it's more likely that my inability to cope with my stress levels/depression is to blame, but she still wants me to be seen. The reason she wants me to be seen is because I had a great-great uncle that passed away in his 30's from Alzheimers, three of his four children (my third cousins) were diagnosed with Alzheimers in their 30's and two of them died in their 30's from it, and then another great-great uncle's son was diagnosed with dementia (but not Alzheimers, not sure what the difference is there) when he was in his 20's. None of my first or second cousins, parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, etc. have ever had it, but it's still there genetically. My mom (same side of the family) has also had Multiple Sclerosis since she was 26 - she's 50 now and her mind is basically gone.   \n\n\nCan depression, anxiety, and stress cause this level of forgetfulness?

This generally happens after they have been exposed to heat, like when I am cooking, out in the summer sun, my feet are in socks under blankets, or the shower. It doesn't always happen with each of these things and I can't find a pattern in why it does or does not. For example, it hasn't happened at all today even though I have taken a hot shower and have had my feet under a blanket most of the day. It happens more to my feet than hands, usually both feet at once, but not always. Sometimes just the toes, sometimes just the bottom of my feet, and sometimes the entire foot. The [pictures show examples of the redness](https://imgur.com/a/89aDKhU). \n\nNo one has been able to give me an explanation for this. I believe it started after I first started taking BC seven years ago, or at least a week after I started that was the first time I noticed it. My doctor changed BC brand, put me on antihistamines, and even took me off the pill for a bit, but nothing helped. So they decided it was probably unrelated, just coincidental timing. It definitely could be. It has stayed about the same over the seven years and never gotten worse or better.\n\nThe other issue is pain. Random sharp pains. Some of this is confused by the pinched nerve in my upper back as to what is being caused by what, especially in my chest, but I can generally tell the difference between the pinched nerve and these other pains. The pinched nerve makes my arm numb and hurts all the way down. These other sharp pains only affect areas a few inches long and very narrow. I've included a [picture of my arm showing some of the common locations and size of the pains](https://imgur.com/a/116CuQe). They also occur in both legs, feet, and my other arm in similar type locations/sizes. They last a few seconds to about ten minutes, but at least one place on my body is almost always having one. I thought sharp pains were normal when I first began noticing them, but it was at least 7 if not more years ago.\n\nI've seen my GP, a neurologist, a physical therapist, and a rheumatologist. My GP sent me to the neurologist who did some electrical tests (nerve function was normal) and an MRI to rule out MS, and then sent me to a physical therapist who figured out the one pinched nerve and then sent me to the rheumatologist who did a bunch of blood tests and ruled out lupus and RA. The rheumatologist said she had no idea, it could be autoimmune, probably involved my blood vessels, and to come back if I ever started developing a rash. That was four years ago now. No rashes but the pains have been getting worse and more frequent. Ibuprofen and Tylenol don't seem to do anything.\n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated as even my GP (who is great and tries really hard to figure things out) doesn't really know where to go from here.

It worked and for the next 15 years on and off was on ssris but also suffer from chronic depression and lack of energy. I also don't know if this is relevant or not but I did two full courses of Accutane at age 15. I currently suffer from fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and no matter how many hours I sleep I never feel rested. Another big issue is my tendons in my arms, it's very easy for them to get tendonitis even by using a regular mouse for a few days, I actually lost a job over it because I was in so much pain and my left arm seized up for several months and would not bend past a 90-degree position. I would liken it to you putting a tennis ball in the crook of my elbow I was not able to bend it past there at all.  It was through much pain that I forced it to bend again. I now have to use a modified mouse for any computer work and it's for only a few hours a day. I have Hypothyroidism, hair loss, chronic B12 deficiency, D3 deficiency and I have also developed progressive multiple drug and food allergies starting at 25. Also progressive hearing loss in left ear along with ringing, chronic  post nasal drip, dysphagia so I have to have water with all my meals or sometimes my swallow reflex seizes up and I choke. As I've gotten older, past 6 years, I've also had serious issues recalling names of objects, how to describe places of objects and will sometimes slur my words or not be able to say a word until two or three tries. I will also sometimes feel like I hallucinate a person or an animal out of the corner of my eye and it bothers me.  Blood pressure is on the low normal end typically ranges between 100 and 110 and heart rate is also in the low normal end with me sometimes getting down to 48 beats per minute per my Android watch. I have been tested for sleep apnea - negative, asthma- negative, multiple seasonal allergies- positive. Standard blood work within normal ranges. Had a stress echocardiogram done within the past 3 months no abnormality seen. Currently taking Singulair and Armour Thyroid 60 micrograms everyday. I was on oral birth control for 15 years but stopped about two years ago.\n\nMy problems started on August 16th 2018. I woke up one morning and it felt like an elephant was on my chest. I felt like I couldn't get enough air and that my lungs weren't working. I went to the ER where they did a CT scan and chest x-ray that came out negative, gave me a nebulizer and told me I probably have bronchitis even though I don't presents with symptoms for bronchitis. Went a few days with just using  my inhaler that my your doctor prescribed, which honestly never really helps in fact it makes me cough pretty severely, went back to the ER no luck dismissed again. I had so much anxiety about my breathing that I actually reduce my food intake quite significantly since it always became even worse when I did eat and lost several pounds. I felt like I needed to try and get my breathing under control so I went on an all fresh fruit and vegetable juice fast for about three weeks to try and some way heal my body, thinking it's possibly a food allergy issue. During that time I never gained more energy, in fact I lost energy, I didn't sleep well at all, and I started to get a very intense ammonia odor inside my nose, which is why I eventually quit about 2 weeks in. But my breathing did improve slightly. The problem is is that the odor still shows up even without juicing. I've also developed a cough especially after eating with quite severe throat clearing in order for me to feel like I'm not choking. mid-December I've started to see spots in my vision. Sometimes they're blue and sometimes they're white centrally-located or peripheraloh, had an ophthalmologist check out my eyes and they didn't find anything. Well now I'm having a new vision symptom and it's hard to describe but it's like if you are looking at a picture ,cut it cleanly down the center in half, tape it back together but have one side slightly above the other and then magically put it equally back together again all within a split second.  I've noticed more often than not it's when I bend over that sometimes these things happen and sometimes it's just when I'm walking and occasionally sitting. In January my hearing has started to be muffled. It's very odd it's both ears it only lasts for about three to four seconds and the whole world is muffled kind of like you're yawning really hard and trying to listen to the TV at the same time, it just doesn't work. And then as soon as it was there it's gone. It's always both ears, it doesn't matter what I'm doing whether I'm sitting, laying down or standing it's always unexpected and it's gone as quick as a came. There's no headaches involved more flushing that I know of but I can always hear my heartbeat in my ears when this is happening. I'm worried I have some weird brain tumor and none of my doctors are taking me seriously. I'm at the end of my rope and I've never felt good physically my entire life so I'm hoping somebody can help me get ahold of what could possibly  be going on or any underlying issues that I'm not aware of.\n\n", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

It doesn't happen EVERY TIME but perhaps more common lately. It has a radiating feeling and if I move it, it immediately resolves itself within 10 seconds or so. Kind of like when your limb goes to sleep, however I think it's related to poor blood circulation because I am a smoker and a little bit chronic (but I stopped to 5 cigs a day recently and plan to stop entirely soon.) I also have colder feet now and I can feel it during the day, so another reason I think it is related to poor circulation. Does this sound about right? Sometimes my foot will have spasms as well and I can see the pulse of my left foot visibly sometimes as well. Occasionally, muscle twitches in my calves and I seem to have neuropathic pain at times as well (symptoms regarding that, including pins needles that last 1-3 seconds and just disappears and re-arises again an hour or so later.)

It's pretty balanced - especially stay away from sulfurous foods like cabbage, excessive red meat, and limit my dairy intake.

Things to note, I had a minor cavity filling that morning. Idk if it's relevant, probably not. When I was going to sleep 3am, I started to feel numbness and tingling in my left cheek (above the cavity I just filled). I tried to ignore it and sleep. After a few minutes my arm and leg on the opposite side started to get pins and needles. Then they both began going numb and weak. I started getting cold numb feeling on other parts of my body, too. My arms, my legs, my chest, but the right side was the weakest and most numb. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was determined to sleep but slept fitfully as I kept waking up in a blind panic out of nowhere (a common occurrence). I got up around 9 and felt ok at first, but once I was awake the numbness began returning to my right arm and leg. I got up to go to the bathroom and stumbled in feeling hot and dizzy as I went. My heart was pounding and I felt like I would pass out if I did not sit with my head down, and my heart slowed when I did that.  As I sat there the numbness  traveled across my chest and back, and my numb arm burned. I managed to make it to the living room where I tried to talk to my gf but found issue sitting up and speaking. I could not get words to come out unless I bent forward. I told her we'd need to go to the urgent care if this didn't pass. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe extreme dizziness and heart racing passed but I was still unsteady on my feet. My legs felt very weak; both of them, but especially the right one. I took a bath and spent most of the day in bed. The weakness and numbness persisted until late in the afternoon. At one point it switched legs. In addition to numbness I felt like my nerves in my right leg and arm were vibrating. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on in the evening my symptoms started to change. I regained most of the strength in my arm and leg but walking or standing upright just seemed incredibly painful. Like every muscle I had had worked out for hours and was begging me to sit down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen the burning started. My neck, back, and chest started off feeling mildly irritated but then it started feeling like someone had applied icy hot all over these areas. In these areas, it's the worst but not the only place. It doesn't stay there all the time, it comes and goes but it comes a LOT. By the time I went to bed it seemed to be everywhere intermittently, but mostly on my back/neck/chest. But I will feel pangs of it on my arms and legs on both sides. Sometimes I'll even feel it in my face. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought perhaps maybe for some reason amitriptyline might have caused this strange side effect; I've taken it for 3 weeks, so idk why it would show up now, so I didn't take it that night. When I was under the covers the burning didn't seem as noticeable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe burning wasn't so bad this morning, but it has gotten worse as the day progresses.  Sometimes it is so bad across my chest it takes my breath away. It's also come with the added symptom of my skin being very sensitive. When I scratch an itch, there is far more pain than usual and it lingers feeling like a sunburn. I am still struggling to walk, I am fatigued. As I am writing this both of my thighs are numb/cold all the way up to my groin. When I touch my back, it registers my hand as cold, but it isn't.  All I want to do is sleep. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just so happened to see a cardiologist today, but he didn't seem concerned with this. But he did write on my 'diagnosis' chart thing that he gave me, when I went to get a Lipid panel, that I had 'tachycardia' and 'sinus tachycardia' \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have an appointment some time soon with my primary, so I am trying desperately to hold out to talk to her but I don't know if I should bump up that appointment.

I actually already have set my sights on an adult ADHD specialist in my area, but her services aren't covered by my insurance and I want to do a little pre-screening to make sure it's worth the investment (I'm in college and not exactly sleeping on cash). So here's what's got me thinking I might have ADHD:\n\n1. I drift off mid-conversation all the time. A lot of people feel like I don't care what they have to say, but the thing is, my mind just goes places I can't seem to control. I'll be talking to my girl friend over coffee and suddenly I look out the window and I'm thinking \"wait, is that building pre-war or just rebuilt in pre-war aesthetics\", even though the conversation isn't about that. \n2. Because of that, I jump from topic to topic. My boyfriend jokes that he needs someone to write down a real-time conversation tree so we can actually finish at least one of the topics.\n3. I butt in mid-sentence when someone speaks. I try to control that, but when I succeed, I lose track of what I was planning to say.\n4. I don't lose things a lot, but even when I put them where they belong, I forget they even belong there.\n5. I'm obsessed with finding new methods of organizing both time and space, and none of them worked for me so far.\n6. I can't focus in lectures in uni. To be fair, I study law and I'm only staying in law because I'm so far along I'd feel bad just dropping it without getting the degree (I realized pretty late I just don't like it), but even so, paying attention seems distinctly harder for me than it seems to be for my friends (some of whom are just as uninterested). I get by on passing grades, but I feel I could do better if I put all that effort I do put into staying awake, into absorbing the information instead.\n7. My mind RACES. All the time. Like having two or three radio stations running in my mind at the same time. It goes on until the very moment I fall asleep. \n8. Starting in elementary school, I've always been called a daydreamer, \"smart but lazy\", \"could do better if she tried harder\". I always felt bad with that because I took school very seriously, but when something didn't interest me, my mind actively rejected learning anything about it. The second I encountered even the slightest resistance in learning, I would just drop it, get a barely passing grade and hope it just wouldn't come up again. \n9. I've had depression. Multiple times (I hear comorbidity with that is pretty high).\n10. I'm terrible at following instructions. When I cook for example, I rarely follow through on the recipe and sometimes what was intended to be a cookie ends up in pasta sauce. \n11. I have wide-ranging interests, but I rarely get into anything in-depth. Right now, I'm in law school and I know I don't wanna do law in the future, but I don't know what I wanna be instead: food scientist, coder, restaurant owner, writer, podcaster, forensic scientist, mathematician... I know I would probably kinda fail at most of these, but they all feel like possibilities. Which is pretty frustrating.\n12. I pace all the time. My step counter tells me I walked 7000 steps today only during two phone conversations. I also fidget, play with my hair, bite pencils. I find that eating or drinking something helps me stay focused.\n\nIt may sound lazy or dumb, but I genuinely feel like something in my wiring keeps me from being productive and attentive. I have honestly tried things. Meditation, pomodoro, turning off mobile devices, studying in a coffee shop, pinching myself when I talk to people, literally biting my tongue, trying different hobbies to see if I'm just unengaged because I didn't find my special \"something\". I don't feel like any of that works. Pomodoro especially I don't get, because even when I keep myself in a distraction-free environment, I trail off mentally. ", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

These were two trigger-point injections and one epidural into the rib joint, all including the steroid depo-medrol, and now my doctor wants me to have an \"experimental\" PRP injection.\n\nI've had multiple x-rays and MRIs done, all of which show very little. My most recent MRI, Thoracic, did show some dark areas along the spine whereas the lower parts of the spine are much brighter, which raised some concern to me but my doctor wasn't to worried, just insisted that I should try the PRP injection.\n\nThe only relief I have found has been by going to a chiropractor and having a rib adjustment performed, which gives me about 6-12 hours of relief from the pain.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

My 'definitely brain cancer' turned out to be tension headaches caused by stiff shoulders, if that gives you an idea of how anxious I am.\n\nAnyway, starting three days ago, I suddenly got this really awful feeling in my chest. I think it's probably best described as a 'fluttering'. Long story short, I *think* it was low blood sugar because I ate some fruit and then some protein and it went away very quickly. All well and good. Well, kinda. Since then I've had sporadic chest discomfort and what feels like pinches of 'pain'.  I don't like to say pain, but I don't know what else to call it. On the 1-10 scale it'd be like a .25 and it only lasts for 2-3 seconds. Hasn't gotten better or worse since it started. No fluttering since then though.\n\nMy heart rate is never super fast, measured it even during the 'pain' times and it's never been higher than 84 bpm, usually in the mid-70s. However, it sometimes feels like it's beating very hard. Again, this only lasts a few seconds. I notice it more when I'm sitting or lying down. Walking, going up stairs, doing 10 push-ups or light exercise I normally get in an average day doesn't cause any issues. The only thing that changed the day before this started was I had been eating a baked potato and peanut butter and jelly sandwich for 6 months Mon-Fri every night without fail. The night before I got the palpitations, I got bored of the potato and sandwich and just opted for a Maru Chan instant ramen bowl or something. I also live a very sedentary lifestyle.

The Neuro team tells me that there are small emboli everywhere in his brain but more so on the right side and that this might just be a waiting game now. My dad will open his eyes and occasionally squeeze a hand. they keep pushing liquids to drive down the sodium which depletes him of potassium which is his other IV. The cardiac team tells me that they dont see a problem with his heart . We are in week 5 of this ordeal and the Dr's here are out of opptions. I walked into my dads room today and saw him responding to the nurse somewhat more than usual and he even had his eyes open for a few min. long enough for me to crack a joke a actually see somewhat of a smile on his face today\n\nHe had to have a tracheotomy done and he is tolerating that well.

I've noticed during the night that I have something that seems to come out through my throat area that makes me have bad/scary dreams and hallucinations such as hearing voices or feeling random pains in my back whenever I inhale it and have my eyes closed or when it's too dark and easy to mistake shapes/shadows. Usually this occurs either when I try to consciously dream about something(I lucid dream a lot since years ago too but only after a few years it started to become uncontrollable/nightmares most of the time), or closer to morning until it stops after having slept enough. I also notice a sour taste in my mouth/throat around the time this is happening. It also tends to be worse the later I go to bed at night. I'm pretty sure I have acid reflux/GERD or something of that sort due to consuming too many acidic foods/drinks in the course of my earlier life although I haven't had the chance to get it properly diagnosed or checked yet(no health insurance), but I am not sure if this is related or if it is a hormone issue or something else? I've also developed a heart/anxiety issue I think since every time I type/chat a bit aggressively or when I am feeling angry/stressed/upset around the time I have eaten soon before, my heartrate seemingly soars to an extremely fast speed to the point I cannot feel it for a little bit and it feels tense around the area until I stop typing and calm myself down, after which I can feel my heartbeat come back and slow down until it's back to resting heartrate(this gets worse every time it happens but I can avoid it by avoiding typing and chatting with people during the time period after I eat and until I finish digesting, since it seems to never happen otherwise). But the weird thing is that when this happens I check my pulse at my neck and it feels normal but the beating at my chest feels like there's double the beats and is going way faster than it actually is according to my pulse. I feel this may be related to the first issue/cause along with stress/anxiety build-up over the years but again I am not completely sure since I have never gotten properly checked up on it.

Lower back pain. Hypothyroidism. Food allergy to chicken, egg and fish.**\n\nHere is a chronological history of my medical problems so far. I have seen several primary care physicians and have been referred to a chiropractor, physiotherapist, spine surgeon, neurologist, urologist, endocrinologist. No one has been able to provide me the correct diagnosis\n\n2011 - Weakness/numbness/tingling/muscular pain in the legs after a bowel movement. Cold Feet. Lasts through the day and goes away after the nightly sleep. The symptoms were more prominent on days where the stool was a little loose. The frequency of this was about once in a month\n\n2012/13 - Frequency increased to about once in a week. With all the above symptoms, I started getting a skin crawling sensation near my groin and thighs\n\n2014/15 - Frequency increased to about twice a week. The same symptoms started showing up after a sexual ejaculation too. I sit for long hours at work. I started getting lower back pain which kind of radiated as a tingling and skin crawling sensation down my legs. I consulted a spine surgeon who prescribed an MRI. MRI Impression on 1/9/2015 - 1) Broad-based disc bulge at L4-5 with right lateral disc herniation at L4-5 with abutment of the right L4 nerve root. 2) Multilevel small disc bulges without neural encroachment. Doctor advised stretching exercises which did not help much. I started seeing a chiropractor but that also did help either.\n\n2016 - I started practicing yoga and after a few days, the back pain reduced considerably. Before that, I got the pain after sitting for about 15 minutes. After doing yoga, I could comfortably sit continuously for as long as 4-5 hours after which the back pain and radiating tingling sensation started. The yoga did not help with the symptoms that showed up after a bowel movement/ejaculation and they remained the same.\n\n2017 - Did another MRI which came out clean. MRI Impression on 2/17/2017 - Unremarkable MRI lumbar spine. PCP referred me to a physiotherapist. Physio said the muscles are tight and highly unlikely for my disc bulges to go away. She instructed a few exercises. They helped stretch the muscles a bit, but were not as effective as yoga.\n\n2018 -\n\nStarted ejaculating frequently in sleep which also caused the leg problems. Did not have any issues with my erection/morning wood\n\n4/10/2018 - TSH - 5.97 UIU/ML, Vitamin B12 - 415 PG/ML, Vitamin D - 35 NG/ML. Started on 25 mcg levothyroxine\n\n4/13/2018 - MRI Impression - 1) Very minimal degenerative disc disease at L4-5 results in minimal central canal and foraminal stenosis. 2) Otherwise unremarkable evaluation of the lumbar spine and terminal spinal cord. Spine surgeon evaluated the MRI images and said there is nothing structurally wrong with my spine to cause these problems. Neurologist did an evaluation and concurred\n\n5/23/2018 - TSH - 5.7, Free T3 - 2.7, Free T4 - 1.4, Negative for Antibodies. Levothyroxine dosage upped to 50 mcg.\n\n7/3/2018 - PCP felt B12 of 400 was a bit on the lower side. Started taking B12 supplement 1000 mcg. Within a couple of days, I felt the symptoms after the ejaculation alleviating a bit(by about 30%). I also felt that my sexual performance was much better now and could hold back the ejaculation a bit longer than usual. But all this could just be the placebo.\n\n7/23/2018 - TSH - 1.67.\n\n8/28/2018 - Took allergy test and was found to be allergic to Chicken, Egg, Fish mix, Shellfish mix. Stopped eating these since then. I feel the frequency of a loose stool and the resulting symptoms has reduced since then, but it could again be just the placebo\n\n9/10/2018 - TSH - 2.85, Vitamin B12 - 740. Stopped taking Levothyroxine to see what effects it has. Started getting the ejaculations in sleep again and felt that the ejaculation was sooner during sexual intercourse\n\n12/10/2018 - TSH - 4.64. Started back again on 50 mcg levothyroxine\n\n2019 -\n\n2/5/2019 - Consulted Urologist and he did not find anything wrong after a physical exam. He did a prostrate exam as well.\n\n2/8/2019 - PCP prescribed Gabapentin to take on an as needed basis.\n\n2/15/2019 - Had an episode of the symptoms after the bowel movement. Took Gabapentin 300mg at round 9.30 AM. Did not make much of a difference with respect to the symptoms, but felt very drowsy in the afternoon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter sitting through the day, I also feel gassy during the evening/night. Could this be a result of the nerves weakening? After the ejaculation, the muscles feel very tight and stretching exercises do not help much.\n\nI am at my wit's end since none has been able to do a proper diagnosis, let alone treat the problems. I already posted in AskDocs with no response. It is very frustrating and depressing when the symptoms start and I just wait for the entire day to pass.

Please help!", "author": "Razerer92", "self_text": "I'm writting this because I'm in a pretty desperate situation and it's starting to look like Reddit is my last hope. Basically I've had a computer ever since I was a kid(I'm now 26) and never had any eye related problems before(other than having to get glasses), no matter how much time I spent in front of it. So it all started around 3 months ago on this particular day when I spent almost the whole day being in front of the computer. I did take short breaks every now and then though. Not sure exactly how many hours had passed(I'm guessing around 12?) when all of the sudden I felt this strong stinging pain and I'm not sure if I felt it in both of my eyes or just in the left one. I'm pretty sure this was caused by the fact that sometimes I forget to blink as much as I should. I looked in the mirror and my eyes look pretty red and tired so I turned off my computer and went to sleep.\n\nEver since that day, I can no longer sit in front of the computer for long periods of time like I used to even though I'm always forcing myself to blink more. In fact, I can only do 1 hour computer sessions at a time before I feel like I need to take a long break from it (also around 1 hour), anything longer than 1 hour in front of the computer screen and my eyes will either get tired, dry or bloodshot. Sometimes I would even feel all of those symptoms at once which is a nightmare to deal with since it's happening every single day since then. Whenever my eyes feel dry and/or tired and I look in the mirror, the surface of my eyes actually looks wet! Which is very confusing and I'm not sure what's happening with my eyes. How could they feel dry if they are actually wet?\n \nWhen my eyes get bloodshot, I often start to feel stinging pain in the area that is red. If I take my eyes off the computer or TV or sometimes even the phone, all the pain and dryness/tiredness slowly starts to go away during the 1 hour break that I usually take. I also started seeing [eye floaters](https://media.giphy.com/media/mYhIQzPpY17xe/giphy.gif) pretty regularly when I look at something bright like the sky for example, which is worrying me a lot.\n \nI also want to mention that I've always kept a considerable distance between my eyes and the computer screen, about an arm's length or 60 cm which seems to be more than enough from what I've read and I'm always getting at least 8 hours of sleep per night so I can\u2019t tell what the problem is.\n\n**What I've tried so far**:\n\n**1**) Visited an expensive eye doctor that prescribed me some regular eyedrops called Augen Tropfen. Used them for a month but didn't do much for me.\n\n**2**) Visited another expensive eye doctor that prescribed me Thealoz duo eyedrops along with Artelac Nighttime Gel. Still taking them to this day but I feel little to no improvement.There are times when I feel like the eyedrops help a little but to be honest most of the time I feel like they don\u2019t do much.\n\n**3**) I've set the contrast and brightness of my monitor to 0. As low as it gets. My eyes still feel the same symptoms after each 1 hour computer session (more or less). If I were to set the contrast and brightness values back to what they were before I would last less time in front of the computer. Around 30 mins.\n\n**4**) Tried staring at the monitor with my glasses. No difference. (And yes the prescription for my glasses is correct as it was confirmed by both doctors but I do not wear them at the computer anyway since I\u2019m nearsighted and see perfectly fine at a short distance).\n\n**5**) Bought a pair of special computer glasses called Gunnar that are supposed to block the harmful blue light. No difference.\n\n**6**) Tried installing a program called f.lux that's also supposed to block the harmful blue light. No difference.\n\n**7**) Took a 2 week long break from the computer. As soon as I started using it again all the symptoms came back.\n\nThis is a very annoying situation to be in and I can't even go to work because of it. I'm feeling pretty hopeless so any advice coming from any of you will be greatly appreciated.\n", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I've come to my breaking point with my chronic pain and I just want some answers. My doctor is constantly fobbing me off and blames everything on my lack of exercise and medical history. He tells me I'll just have to learn to manage my pain. I'm 20 years old - I shouldn't be feeling like a 80y/o.\n\n**Quick background on me:**\n\nI'm F/20, white and from Ireland. I'm 5'4 and around 150lbs. I do pilates weekly and walk often with my dogs. I work from home so I spend most everyday at my desk and my evenings in bed. I don\u2019t smoke, I don\u2019t drink, I don\u2019t do drugs, I sleep 8 hours every night, I eat pretty well and I drink water.\n\n**Previous diagnoses:**\n\n* Depression for 12 years.\n* Discitis  in my L3 and L4 discs in 2015 and 2016, where I took vigorous IV antibiotics for 8 weeks and spent 5 of them in hospital. The final 3 weeks of abx I administered myself through a PICC line. Consistent back pain ever since, worsening in the last year.\n* I have MRKH, diagnosed in 2014 (I think).\n\n**Symptoms**:\n\n* Constant fatigue which worsens as the day goes on, regardless of what I'm doing -- I'm not anemic, I get bloods taken every few months so I have no deficiencies. Being in Ireland we are very prone to vitamin D3 deficiencies, so I have to take supplements every few months for that but I'm up to date atm.\n* I have consistent aches in my mid-leftand full lower back, plus muscle weakness in my whole back - pain worsens with activity which is why I don't run (even though I love running).\n* I have been getting pains in my sacrum on the right and both hips on and off for 10 or so months. The pain in my sacrum is like a shooting pang that lasts for on average 30 seconds. I haven't got it in a few months.\n* I have pain and weakness in my knees all day everyday, worsens with activity.\n* I fell down the stairs last February and I guess bruised my coccyx, and it hurts when I stand up from sitting down, even 12 months on.\n* I have pain in my right wrist, been there for about 4 years undiagnosed. I've had scans done on it but they found nothing, I think it's a bone spur as I have a bony lump right in the centre.\n* I also find pain in my fingers when I bend them but it doesn't bother me like everything else.\n* On top of these, I have been getting these random dull, throbbing pains in my left arm for about 6 months. The pain can last anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes, and kind of moves up and down my arm, although mainly in my forearm. Activity and movement doesn't affect it, and it seems nothing brings it on - it's just random. I also find my same arm feels weak when these pains arise. Sometimes I get the exact same feeling in my left leg. These pains can happen a few times a week, but not every week. They usually come all in one day, and not again for a few days, if you get me? It's so bad that it kind of paralyses me for the duration of the pain. These pains kinda oddly radiate into the left side of my abdomen and back, but not very far.\n* Last week I got this hideous stabbing pain in the upper right quadrant of my abdomen that lasted for 48hrs, and I haven't gotten it since. The pain radiated in my back and nothing relieved it, not even strong painkillers (Solpadeine). It's been a while since my pains have brought me to tears, but this one definitely did.\n\n**Medications I'm on:**\n\n* Tetralysal 300mg for acne daily, on and off for about 6 years\n* Escitalopram 20mg for depression daily, since November 2017\n* Vitafen 100mg for my aches and pains once or twice a week, for a few months\n* Over the counter energy boosters (don't work lol)\n* Cod liver oil daily\n* Halo Beauty Kiwi Boosters for my skin daily.\n\n**More info:**\n\nMy dad has arthritis (we believe) from years of rough and vigorous sports (rugby, long distance athletics, gaelic football etc) and years of construction, especially roofing and tiling. He struggles with most the same as me but his are from untreated injuries from his youth. My family has a history of strokes on my dad's side, but I don't know anything else as I don't know my extended family beyond one grandparent on either side. I recently got x-rays done of my lumbar and pelvis and apparently they found nothing out of the ordinary, but I'll be seeing my doctor next week regarding them so I might have an update.\n\nUPDATE as this was written a few weeks ago: He found \"retrolisthesis\" in one of the discs which explains the lower back pain but nothing else.\n\nI think I've pretty much included everything and it's definitely an information overload!! I really hope you guys can help me because my doctors have no interest in helping. He's just tired of me now I guess. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask, I just want to have some idea of what's going on.\n\nTIA XOXO", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I had an x-ray, and nothing came up on it, so it wasn\u2019t a bone or anything like that. I went to my college doctor, and he said that he would refer me to a hand specialist. The same day he told me this however, I played a game of volleyball, in which I was outside hitter (hits the ball a lot and very hard). After the game the ball was gone. I am freaking out, because now I think it might have been a cyst of some sort and I popped it playing the game. If this is the case, is there a possibility I have cancer in my hand or am I just freaking out? Should I be worried?", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

The pharmacy has given my sleeping tablets until I can see the doctor - but I\u2019m still getting up multiple times a time! I\u2019ve had my urine tested and there\u2019s no sugar present?\n\nEven small amounts of urine will wake me up. Small amounts are worse as my bladder feels really irritated from the concentrated urine.\n\nI\u2019ve always had a weak/overactive bladder in the day, never at night! I\u2019ve had 1 UTI 5 years ago, and a kidney infection last year. \n\nAny ideas? Was thinking interstitial Cystitis - but I don\u2019t have any pain? \n\nI was also thinking Diabetes Insipidus?\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nThanks!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}
