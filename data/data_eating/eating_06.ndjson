I'm posting my current experience because I want to understand if it's normal to feel this way. Or if my feelings that I'm pretending to have an eating disorder mean that I am just pretending!\n\nME: I'm a guy in my late 20s, and I'm currently off work with 'stress'. I work as a Dr in the NHS in the North of England. I do have various psychiatry appointments on the way and have had lots of contact with my GP - I don't have a diagnosis at present.\n\nWHAT'S HAPPENED: Recently I've lost a lot of weight, and have found my job incredibly stressful. This has resulted in me taking my first ever period of sick leave from work after 8 years of work.\nBut I've come to realise I've also become (what feels like) extremely controlling about my food and what I eat - this has been increasingly so over, realistically, the last 2.5 years give or take. And a lot of my stress probably stems from this boiling over into my job.\n\nHOW I FEEL, SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS: In terms of both how I feel and objective abnormalities my blood counts are low, I'm constantly apathetic - not sad or happy, I struggle to enjoy anything, I get super cold, I've not weighed this little since I was about 14 years old, I haven't had any libido for months, I get stomach cramps, I've been getting leg cramps and back aches, I get very anxious and guilty around food and social occasions with food/alcohol/calories, and you can see the veins all over my body (Grim).\n\nBUT... I FEEL GUILTY ABOUT MY ACTIONS The thing is, this all feels like a choice to me. And I don't know why I'm choosing to do it? I don't feel ill, sure I feel tired and hungry, but out of decisions I make. And objectively I can see they're bad for me, I just struggle to do something sensible like eat a bit more!\n\nWEIRD THINGS I DO - It takes me at least 30 minutes to buy lunch from the shop, I walk round and round and inevitably come out with a salad or a small soup - I don't let people cook for me at home, I don't let people serve me food - I do a lot of cooking, I enjoy it, but I'll normally give away most of the food I make. The best example of this is baking where I'll probably have half a slice of brownie and palm off the rest on other people. - I avoid restaurants, if it's unavoidable I google menus for ages and try to work out the calories or pick out places you can eat which have small meals. I never pick something I actually want to eat. - I run or drink squash to suppress my appetite, as well as running for calorie burn - If I eat a snack, I'll often end up spitting it out - I avoid nuts, dairy, meat, apples/pears, alcohol, coffee with milk in... in fact I haven't had a beer for months because it feels like wasted calories. - If someone brings food to work, I tend to hoard it. Same at a buffet. I'll grab loads, then put it in lunchboxes so I can eat it later - often I'll give the food away rather than eat it myself.\n\nMY QUESTION Do these behaviours and choices I make stack up with an ED diagnosis? Or am I just trying to get attention or something like that?\nThanks for your help guys :)", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

It's an ongoing fight. But it's getting better.\n1) KEEP A FOOD DIARY. Even when you binge. It's basic rule.\n2) We have extremely obese patients in our treatment and never ever ever had our doctor recommended diet.\n3) mental health is almost always connected to binging. Almost 80% of our treatment group takes antidepressants and others were sent to the doctor immidiately\n4) Addmiting that you are sick and cannot do certain things is important. Overeating on that Mcdonalds at friends Friday? You gotta learn to say no because you're ill and it works this way. You of course can eat regular portion, but not act binge - Y and overeater - y\n5) CALORIES DON'T EXIST. THERE ARE NO FORBIDDEN FOODS. GOOD AND BAD FOODS DON'T EXIST.\n6) You have to allow yourself your fav foods in moderate portions to recover\n7) you won't gain weight from one binge. The most important is to get back on track.\n8) EAT EVERY TWO TO FOUR HOURS. Even if you have to set a timer. Some girls actually told their surroundings they have a diabetes and they have to eat often.\n9) FOOD IS THE FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT MEDICINE. WILLPOWER IS THE SECOND.\n10) PSYCHOTERAPY FOR EVERYONE\n11) IT'S TRULY A HABIT. By engaging in it you are strengthening the habit. Don't do it.\n12) Even if there are mental health issues, in the end, it's up to you.and you can blame your mental health, your family issues, your friends and families but in the big picture it doesn't matter. You are doing this for yourself and only for yourself. If your mental illness is so bad it keeps you from recovering, hospitalization or strknger meds are an option.

{"post_id": "bvlhk2", "created_utc": 1559400068, "title": "Tips to overcoming the urge to binge", "author": "RachAgainstLeMachine", "self_text": "- I originally posted this on another sub, but after an overwhelming amount of positive feedback,  I felt like I should post this here too\n\nHi all!\n\nI\u2019ve been officially binge-free now for 3 years. My binges used to be pretty severe, ranging anywhere from 6000-8000 calories 1-3 times/week.\n\nIt was a tough binge/restrict cycle that went on for 3 years and progressively got worse. I don\u2019t know what triggered my epiphany and made me officially stop binging once and for all, but one day I just decided that I was done. From then on, it was tough, but I kept some things in mind that helped me pull through:\n\n1. It can be easy to slip into \u201cfuck it\u201d mode when you binge. You don\u2019t care about anything. But before you allow yourself to reach for the binge food, just take a minute\u2014 even just a few seconds\u2014 to think about the future. How will I feel about this tonight? Or tomorrow? Reflecting on how shitty I felt after previous binges was enough to stop me in my tracks.\n\n2. Think about the availability of the food you want to binge on. What are you binging on? Is it food that will be there tomorrow? If so, have a little now and a little tomorrow. If it\u2019s food that won\u2019t be there tomorrow, eat what you can, and save the rest for later. Party food was always my downfall. But since my goal to stop binging, I\u2019ve learned to just ask for a plate to take home for someone. Party hosts are usually more than happy to have someone take the extra food off their hands. \n\n3. While on the topic of parties: don\u2019t get sucked into the fear of going to parties because of the food. The party most likely isn\u2019t about the food; it\u2019s about the social aspect. Use the party as an opportunity to catch up with old friends/family and make new friends. The point of a party is neither to sit in a corner and stuff yourself nor be intimidated by the food. The food is just extra. The party is the crowd. \n\n4. Think about what you are going to eat in relation to how long it would take to burn. If I want to eat 3 Oreos, that\u2019s about 20 minutes of running. Whether you do it or not, 160 calories in the big picture isn\u2019t a big deal. How about an entire pack of Oreos, and then some? That\u2019s workout time that I don\u2019t even WANT to think about. \n\n5. Why do you want those chips? Are you actually hungry or are you just bored/upset? Take about a half hour to go for a walk, draw something, read\u2014 anything productive, really. If you still want those chips, go for it. Just, again, keep the other tips in mind. \n\n6. A lot of the time, people mistake thirst for hunger. Try drinking some water before eating the craving.\n\n7. Sleep can also affect how you eat. If you can, try to take a nap when you feel a binge coming on. The extra rest sometimes helps combat the urge.\n\n8. Think about your goal. This is similar to #1. What will the binge do in regard to achieving your goal? It will probably set you back some.\n\n9. Want peanuts? Want cookies? Want crackers? Want popcorn? Take a portion out of the bag. And then put the bag away. And then walk away with your portion and eat it in another room. And if you finish and want more, reflect. Do you really want more, or is it a binge? Can you wait and have more tomorrow? Usually\u2014 surprisingly\u2014 the answer is yes. I can wait until tomorrow. When the food is out of sight and a walk away, it\u2019s a lot less tempting. \n\n10. To all of my fellow bakers: chew gum and wear plastic gloves while baking. When you finish mixing, put the bowl and mixers in the sink with soapy water IMMEDIATELY. When you need to taste the batter, try a TINY bite, and then immediately drink some water. It\u2019ll fill your stomach right up. \n\n11. Brush your teeth. Yes. This actually helps a lot. You\u2019ll be a lot less likely to binge when you have fresh breath. \n\n12. Don\u2019t deprive yourself too much. That\u2019s what leads to binging in the first place. My binge kryptonite used to be nature valley sweet &amp;amp; salty cashew bars. I could eat like 2 whole boxes and more. I started allowing myself to have one a day about 2 years ago. And then after a while (about 1/day for 3 months)...I got sick of them. I didn\u2019t want them anymore. I haven\u2019t eaten any since then, and I honesty have no desire to.  \n\n13. Don\u2019t weigh yourself. Really, don\u2019t do it. You\u2019re either going to go into \u201cwow im lighter than I thought, I deserve extra food\u201d or \u201cwow I\u2019m heavier than I thought can\u2019t get worse than this let\u2019s binge\u201d mode. The scale is fucking evil, friends.\n\nThose are my tips! If I forgot one, I\u2019ll add it in later. If anyone else has any tips that have helped them, feel free to add. \n\nI sincerely hope these tips are helpful to this community. I\u2019ve seen plenty of posts where individuals beat themselves up over binges. The most important thing is to take care of yourself and remember how loved you are \u2764\ufe0f", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I\u2019m not losing weight but have been sort of stalled out at a very low BMI for months and can\u2019t put weight on. \n\n\nMy parents are aware of my ED and I just came home from college for the summer. They *really* don\u2019t know how to deal. My dad keeps buying ice cream and cookies and junk food and just expecting me to eat it (yesterday he bought a pint of full-fat caramel swirl ice cream and a box of shortbreads, today he went to a bakery and bought a dozen fancy cookies and a loaf of banana bread, he also took me to a cafe and offered to buy me any pastry I want, and there are two unopened packets of chocolate digestive biscuits in the cupboard I know he bought for me). I hate that all of this food is getting wasted because it\u2019s expensive and he\u2019s doing it for me, but .... I *just* graduated myself to eating non-diet sandwich bread. That banana bread loaf is going to rot. \n\n\nMy mother is even worse, and our relationship has always been a lot rockier. Last night for my first dinner at home I planned a meal that felt really safe for me (stir fry with veggies and tofu and a little rice). When we sat down my parents decided to talk about a friend of theirs who has an eating disorder. My mother commented on how she\u2019s entirely gluten-free now and looked at me and said, \u201cI mean, you know what those people do, her whole plate is just piled high with salad.\u201d Like, thanks, I don\u2019t feel totally invalidated now for eating rice and oil. I couldn\u2019t finish my plate. She just understands nothing about nutrition. Later we had a chat and I tried explaining what safe foods and fear foods are. One of my biggest fear foods is granola because it\u2019s so caloric. My mother said, \u201cOh no, I buy a healthy granola, it\u2019s totally paleo so no junk in it at all.\u201d I looked it up and it\u2019s 380 calories per 1/2 cup - all nuts and seeds and coconut oil of course. This morning I was eating a plain yogurt and my mother asked me if I\u2019d looked at the granola and I said yes and told her the calorie count - she stared at the granola and then put it away and said \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just have toast\u201d. I also told her it was really important for me to get a lot of protein and she said it sounded like I wasn\u2019t eating enough fats and carbs. I said no, I eat a lot of avocado, and she said avocado wasn\u2019t really a fat, only butter and oil are fats. And I eat tons of carbs, sweet potatoes and beans and tempeh, but she doesn\u2019t understand that things other than bread, rice, and pasta can be carbs too. \n\n\nThe worst part of all is that she doesn\u2019t really want me to recover. I\u2019m currently 15lbs underweight and she\u2019s repeatedly told me I shouldn\u2019t gain more than five pounds and that it\u2019s ok if I stay underweight because she\u2019s always been underweight. When I told her the goal weight my doctor set for me (which would put my BMI at 19) my mother said that seemed too high. She also praised me for eating so little throughout the day when I told her my breakfast + lunch rarely exceed 400 calories and that she thinks it\u2019s fine if I only eat dinner. And yet she comments on every bite I put in my mouth. I\u2019m constantly being watched. Its actually making me want to restrict *more*. \n\n\nI don\u2019t know. I guess I\u2019m just confused. I don\u2019t have the energy to take care of myself and my parents. I just wanna eat what I wanna eat.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

Can anyone else relate?", "author": "Lethargicmandarin", "self_text": "TW: my entire life story \n\n\nAs a child, I was never overweight, just ate a lot due to being an athlete and going through growth spurts. I definitely feel like I had what I now consider to be \u201cbinges\u201d, but they never affected my weight and I never cared much about weight or calories or body image.\n\nThen, I was bullied by a \u201cfriend\u201d for \u201ceating too much\u201d. Ironically, she was struggling with being overweight herself so she bullied other people and took her insecurities out on her friends. \n\nAs a result, I developed restrictive anorexia when I was a young teen, which turned into AN B/P (binging and fasting and then binging and fasting, rinse and repeat). \n\nBecame severely underweight, then got put on a massive meal plan (hypermetabolism) and gained weight until I felt \u201cfat\u201d (while in reality still underweight. I had a lot of body dysmorphia...). \n\nStarted losing weight again. Cycled through treatment, went to tons of doctors, therapists, programs, etc., hated everything and left. \n\nEventually, I starting lifting weights and gaining weight on purpose. I was finally satisfied with my body when still slightly underweight and excessively lean due to overexercising. Then, I started binging. I gained some more weight as a result and felt terrible.\n\nNow I\u2019m at the lower end of a healthy BMI and I feel...ambivalent. I would like to lose a bit of fat, but I don\u2019t feel like I need to lose much weight to be okay with my body. Physically, I\u2019m healthy. I\u2019m hyperfocused on my athletic performance more than anything else.\n\nThe thing I hate the most is that I have leftover shitty eating habits. I binge 1000-1800 calories a couple times a week, usually because of undereating, so I consider myself to have BED. However, I have a high TDEE due to being an athlete and having increased muscle mass, so my weight isn\u2019t affected.\n\nI am just  frustrated with my eating habits. I\u2019m terrified of other people judging how much I eat, i have no proper hunger and fullness cues, I obsessively count calories and exercise, I won\u2019t eat certain foods, I have phases of body dysmorphia, and I think about food very often.  \n\nIn short, I\u2019m fucked.

I'm just hoping there's somebody out there that understands what's happening here. Honestly, now that I've reread this post, it kind of seems that I'm getting healthier about how I'm treating food. However, someone else weigh in. I don't want to think I'm getting better and it turns out I'm off the rails. \n\nSo I've been taking about 30 mg of Vyvanse (and 20mg Prozac) to treat BED for the past five weeks. Although I was apprehensive at first and worried about side effects, from what I can see it seems to be going well. My bingeing has stabilized (for the most part), my reactive hypoglycemia resolved itself, and I lost the approximately 15lbs I'd put on when I started bingeing again. Currently 166.9 (started two years ago at about 275, got to about 164, but then ballooned back up to 185 when bingeing full on).\n\nThe problem is, I'm starting to perceive that I'm bingeing again and it is threatening to undermine all the work I put in.  However, it's kind of different from normal bingeing.  Normally when I binge, I will eat anything that isn't glued down, even if I don't like it or don't want it. Now it feels like I'm getting cravings for very specific things (NOT PREGNANT), for example, fairlife chocolate milk and cottage cheese. The rational part of me says that this must be a sign that I need protein, and it makes sense that my body might be lacking certain things given how much I'm outside running in the Florida heat (I'd say I'm decently active and run 20 to 30 miles per week).  However, the irrational bingeing and restricting part of my brain wants to tell me that I've eaten enough that day and not to eat anymore. To test this out, I've been overriding the urge to restrict and consuming what my body is telling me to eat.  If my body says have that chocolate milk, I have it. And then that's it. Most days I eat between 1,200 and 2,000 calories. Despite all of this, I am either maintaining or losing weight. \n\nMy question is, is it possible that my body can tell the difference between BED and intuitive eating, but I can't? What I mean by that is, is it possible that my body is simply asking for what it needs and this is not a binge episode even though my brain thinks it is?  Is this what recovery from BED looks like, or am I on the edge of a relapse?\n\nSide note, let me just say that restricting a secret evil when it comes to BED. I was so focused on the bingeing, I honestly didn't even realize how badly I'd been restricting until I started taking the Vyvanse. I've spent most of these past 5 weeks working with a dietitian to make sure I eat quality food at regular intervals. I can't believe how hard that has been.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I make myself purposefully skip meals and not eat due to the absolute pure hate I have for my body. I want to torture myself and deny it of sustenance just to feel the pain and I feel so proud when I go days without eating. Not sure what to diagnose it and I haven\u2019t thought that far into it, other than realising how wrong it is, and I\u2019m not sure if I want to. I\u2019ve just kinda thought that it\u2019s a phase that I will (hopefully) grow out of soon.\n\nThe main issue isn\u2019t me though. Yesterday, the closest friend I\u2019ve ever had (literally a part of me, there\u2019s no one I love more) revealed that she\u2019s struggling with anorexia. Obviously the news broke me and I\u2019m kicking myself over how I hadn\u2019t noticed, but she also mentioned that she decided to tell me now because she knows about my issues too, noticing little things like my minor loss of weight and me denying food on occasion. I\u2019ve talked to her before about my depression and she\u2019s witnessed me at my lowest points but we\u2019ve never discussed food before and this is new territory for both of us as I haven\u2019t wanted to burden her with ANOTHER one of my issues in the past. We have no idea how to stop doing this to ourselves and we both don\u2019t want to (though we know we have to). Her issues stem more from drug abuse (marijuana) I\u2019ve told her she needs to stop with the regular smoking and she knows that it\u2019s so incredibly unhealthy (and recognises it as the main cause) but it\u2019s so much easier said than done and I believe it\u2019s a a source of comfort for her due to other issues in her life at the moment.\n\nThe last thing to add to the mix is our other friend, who has an incredibly serious case of bulimia and has been struggling for a really long time. Her doctor says if she doesn\u2019t stop the purging soon her body will quite literally shut down but even that isn\u2019t enough to motivate her and we have NO idea how to help. Her parents don\u2019t seem to care enough and ultimately it all comes down to her, but she seems to be too far gone.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for the long read and I\u2019m honestly not sure if this is even the right place to go but I guess I just really need some help, advice, anything? I want to help my friends but I don\u2019t know how?? Going to their parents (and mine) is definitely not an option, for other reasons, and I just feel so useless. I guess we\u2019re all just a bunch of messed up teenagers and in the long run it might actually just be a \u2018phase\u2019 but it sure doesn\u2019t feel like it right now.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

After all the past years I had been telling myself fat, I started to control my food and I apparently lost weight to the point of people telling me if I was on a diet, but I didn\u2019t think I was fat. The first year I cut down on junk food like chips, and since then I don\u2019t eat them. Then I started to cut down cookies and greasy things. I controlled my food but I actually ate something. Things got \u201cworse\u201d in this year. I started to control everything. People said I was not fat, but I literally cried and got mad because I didn\u2019t see myself as skinny and it made me mad that they were lying to me. Well, I become obsessed with food and people often called me a skeleton, which made me mad because I still saw myself as fat. I don\u2019t know if I have an eating disorder because I told myself to eat and well, I did, although sometimes I felt guilty and i made myself sick, but some days I just starve. I sometimes starve if I want to wear specific clothes. Now I gained weight, and I\u2019m trying to lose it again, but I eat sometimes, and it\u2019s really confusing me, because I really eat, and sometimes greasy things without feeling guilty enough to throw up.\nBut I have \u201cfear foods\u201d, por example, I haven\u2019t eaten chips in like two years, or hamburgers, which I crave a lot, or mayo. Mayo is really the scariest food, and I can\u2019t eat those foods. Sometimes I starve and I cry because people make eat but I feel like I\u2019m failing. So I\u2019m in this cycle un which some days I don\u2019t eat anything at all, it I just eat once a day, but I sometimes eat a lot. I do feel cold all the time, and Love cooking but not eating the food. I love watching people eat(mukbangs or ASMR). Even though I get really hungry it feels good, it\u2019s like a torture to me, but a sweet one and I just don\u2019t know if I have an eating disorder. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m so fat, I think so, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t exercise excessively, for example, and I don\u2019t feel sick enough. My parents took me to a psychiatrist, but she just focused on my depression instead of my food behaviours. I\u2019m really sad, because no one has taken my \u201cproblem\u201d seriously. I also don\u2019t know if I restrict. Like if I eat, I would eat like a half of a small bowl, but I\u2019m so used to those portions that I think they are normal and the ones I should be eating. If not more.  But whenever someone serves my food, I just think it\u2019s a lot, and I\u2019m the only one thinking that. But I don\u2019t know If it\u2019s my mind or it is actually a lot, or if that is the actual normal serving. And I don\u2019t know how to find out that. For example, when I want to add something to a food, I add what i think is normal and everyone\u2019s serving I so much bigger.\nI remember once I told to myself that I had to \u201cget better\u201d and I went to Mc Donald\u2019s and ordered chicken nuggets and they asked me how many, let\u2019s say the min. They give you is six nuggets and the max. Is twelve? Well I started to think,\u201dNo, ten or twelve are too much, just get six\u201d and so I did, but when I started eating I then I realized I said I was going to get better, and I truly didn\u2019t want six. I wanted more, but I immediately ordered six. And whenever people ask me if i want a chip or anything. Even fruit, I say \u201cno\u201d. It\u2019s really weird. I honestly don\u2019t think I have an eating disorder. Like I\u2019m way to fat to have one, I\u2019m not even underweight.

She actually doubts that it's my weight, and my body fat percentage is \\~20 e.g. not low enough to be a cause on its own.\n\nMy only worry is about bone loss. I'm not concerned with reproductive function; in fact, the only reason I do not get my tubes tied is that I don't sleep with men anyway. While I may like to be a mom one day (e.g. my wife can have the kids or we can adopt), I have a bunch of shit genes that I don't want to pass on, and am deeply uncomfortable with the idea of being pregnant/giving birth. **All I'm worried about is bone loss.** I LIVE for extreme sports, and really don't want to get osteoporosis when I'm forty. Would probably kms. But the issue is, I also have mild gender dysphoria (don't want to transition; I think of myself as a very masculine woman) and also was suicidal when I had curves. You see my dilemma here? I've managed to get my weight back into a healthy range while keeping the curves off, but I'm still afraid. If I have to bootleg estrogen supplements (or a really low dose of testosterone), I fucking will, but I really don't want to have to do that. \n\nI actually kind of hope it is my weight, since I ultimately will want to be adding at least 10 lbs more of mass, all told. I'm about at the weight now at which I initially lost my period 18 months ago. So if it is weight, it could theoretically just end up taking care of itself. I doubt it is body fat %, since I'm at about 20% body fat, which is nowhere near close to low enough to be a cause in and of itself.\n\nSince I lost my period, I have not spent much time eating maintenance at all. I found my maintenance about 6 months after, and then it rose again due to muscle increase. Then I relapsed into restriction for about four. And then about one. My BMI was never below 17. So even if it was restriction, I suppose I haven't given it much time to come back?\n\nOfc, periods don't nessesarily mean healthy estrogen levels. A year ago, when I got tested, my doctor said that my hormone levels were normal, so i was quite happy to go on not having a period, lol. But I'd still like to hear your experiences, in part just for reassurance, I guess. I'm being sent for an MRI among many other things, and it's all very anxiety inducing. In fact, I've resorted to drinking to help myself get back to sleep and am typing this while waiting for it to kick in (second time this year I've done that, which is two times too many imo)\n\n**Tl;DR-** How long did it take for your period to come back once you were a healthy weight/not restricting too hard", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

{"post_id": "bwbmu6", "created_utc": 1559574054, "title": "My binging/IBS story - just need to vent.", "author": "angelofdragons", "self_text": "I've been struggling with binge eating for around four or five years now. For a while, I didn't even think it was a disorder, or called anything. I just thought I liked to eat. I was lucky enough that I still had a fast metabolism so I could binge on one meal for the day and usually feel full. But as I continued the habit, and the years went on, it was like my stomach expanded. I started eating more, and I gained a good amount of weight. However, for my height, even at my heaviest I was never considered \\*overweight\\* (yet). I was considered chubby at best, maybe, but my friends and family were too nice to call me that. I guess that factored in the delusion that I didn't have a problem, that I just liked to eat and live life, and that I was a \"healthy weight\" instead of being stick skinny. The truth was, my healthiest/most natural weight was probably 25 pounds lighter and my binging was making me gain more and more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would never binge in front of people - although I did overeat at restaurants - but my full on binges were ALWAYS alone. I would eat three donuts, a hotdog and a milkshake in one sitting, and then eat a bag of candy later. I would binge on Domino's, Taco Bell, Wendy's, restaurant food, kitchen food, whatever was available. I would tell myself it was okay because I'd say \"this will be my only meal of the day\" but then I'd overeat hours later. I would also drink a lot too. I ended up gaining around 25-30 pounds over my natural weight and I hated every second of it. I would go through cycles of calorie restricting, working out a ton, losing a couple of pounds, then \"celebrating\" by overeating and overdrinking again. I hated the way I looked, honestly, but I was living in a delusion by telling myself I deserved to binge, I deserved to eat, I was just living life and that it wasn't like I was obese, so it was \\*okay\\*. \n\nOf course, I was miserable, and my eating habits were making miserable. Then, my IBS got really bad. It got so bad I had to start going to the doctor regularly and start a new strict diet. I started mapping FODMAPS, gave up dairy, gave up a lot of fried foods, gave up fake sugars, and started eating drastically smaller meals (like to the point where people thought I had an eating disorder). It was all I could do to control my horrible digestive issues, which seemed to flare up at the most random of foods. It was honestly a blessing in disguise because once I started eating such smaller meals and healthier food, I realized how HORRIBLE I had been eating before. I would feel disgusted at how much I binged, how much I overate at restaurants, how much I drunk ate, etc. I truly only ate when I needed to, I avoided treats wherever possible (but still ate things I liked - thank god sushi is IBS friendly) and I lost all the excess weight I had gained from binging. For the first time in my life I felt light and like this was my true self. Binging wasn't my true self. That wasn't me. I didn't grow up overeating or binging, it was a bad habit that I developed in college, and it was a habit I was proud to have given up.\n\nNow my IBS has gotten a lot better and so has my tolerance of foods. I've started eating all those bad things I gave up - fried foods, dairy, desserts - and the weight has been creeping back on. I feel so gross. The binges have returned. Last night I ate 4 pancakes and a few strips of bacon, a whole big bag of cheese puffs, a share bag of bite sized Reese's, a share bag of bite sized Kit Kat's, and a really thick mini carton of chocolate milk. I felt so utterly horrible during the binge that I kept drifting in and out of sleep (overeating always makes me need to nap after). I didn't talk to anyone because I felt so bloated and tired. The next day I could barely work in the morning because my IBS was so upset from everything I ate. I still feel full and it's almost lunchtime the next day. \n\nI just don't understand why, despite all the disgust, guilt, regret, and pain I feel after a binge, that I still go and do it. How could my body want something that's so terrible for me - for every part of me? I don't gain anything from a binge, nothing at all. I get a few minutes of satisfaction as I eat the disgusting binge food and then after that, it's all downhill. I feel so much regret for overeating, for continuing to gain weight I really don't need. I feel guilt for treating my body like a trash compactor when it does so much for me. I feel bloated and heavy from my IBS. I feel like my stomach is begging me for just a normal meal for once with fruits, vegetables, healthy proteins and carbs, and a NORMAL amount that doesn't stretch it out beyond belief. My true self is begging me to stop binging, I can feel it. I've been listening to Brain over Binge and I totally agree that my \"binge self\" doesn't even feel like me. It feels like some ogre that inhales trash and makes me feel like shit. My higher being, my true self knows I don't want any of that crap, it knows I don't need it.\n\nI just don't know how to start listening to it. I'm really trying, I am. It's just so hard when I feel a pang of hunger and then think \"you know what sounds great right now? A ton of candy, a ton of chocolate, some beer, and a slice of pizza\". Like, it just sucks.

When I plan what I eat, again not only am I preventing overeating (or under-eating which leads to eating more later, probably a binge) , but I\u2019m also giving myself control over my food. When I\u2019m preparing my food and eating it, I\u2019m not guilty and upset over it. I gave myself the power to eat and I controlled how much it was and what it was. \n\nJust sharing because I\u2019ve only focused on the first part in the past and it made journaling my food not work for me, and I think it\u2019s important to look at the control that you have to acknowledge you have:)", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I've struggled with small bouts of disordered eating (nothing that I would entirely call an ED though) a bit through my life so I was fairly proud of myself. \n\nI hit a plateau in my weight loss about two or three weeks ago and decided to recalculate my calorie goal. My deficit had me eating at 1520, and the new calculation dropped me down to 1440. Even just that 100 cal or so difference made it a bit more difficult for me to not eat too much at all my meals. I started IF the other day so that I could skip breakfast and save more calories for later in the day.\n\nIt's like the new calculation hit some sort of switch in my brain that's launched me back into disordered habits, like looking at thinspo and ED subs. I know that 1400 is still a deficit that will make me lose weight, but something inside me says I should drop it lower (1200) so I can lose even faster.

So a couple weeks ago I went to a therapist and was told I had anorexia to the point where I need to be put in inpatient immediately. I\u2019m an 18 year old female who is going into her second year of college and I have never been away from home for a long period of time because the college where I go to is in my hometown so I live at home. The closest eating disorder treatment was 3 hours away so I begged my mom not to make me go and decided I wanted to take recovery into my own hands. It\u2019s been about a week now and I\u2019m hungry all the time and am eating practically 24/7 except for when I\u2019m sleeping. My stomach looks like I am 6 months pregnant and im experiencing severe constipation. I don\u2019t even want to leave the house at this point because of how I look. Is all of this normal? Should I honor hunger cues even if I ate a meal already? At this point I\u2019m just scared that I\u2019m starting to develop depression because of how I look and honestly just want to restrict again to make the bloating go away.

I don't know if anyone cares to read it, but I just need to get it off my chest.\n\nI'm a broke college student, and for the past year, I've been living with my dad and step-mother. Before that, I used to dorm at school for three years, but I can no longer afford it as I've maxed out my federal aid. And, before that, my mom had primary custody of me. I grew up really poor with my mom, and we were often evicted. I can't live with her currently and go to school at the same time because she lives in a tiny studio apartment in the worst neighborhood in the city and it's two hours away from where I go to school.\n\nSo, the current situation:\n\nMy step-mother has always been abusive. She recently found out my dad bought me two lipglosses from Sephora (she found a receipt), and she started throwing glass plates on the floor and at me. This has been my breaking point. I just can't take it anymore.\n\nI've been relapsing hard into my ED lately. I reached out for help at school, but after this event, I don't even know whether I want to recover. I just want to die. I really, really want to die. So badly. I don't know if I can actually go through with directly killing myself, but I'm so tempted to starve to death. \n\nI have no financial independence at all. I only have $1000 in savings, and the lowest rent prices in my city are around $1,100/month for a studio. I recently got hired at a job, but the background check is extensive, so I don't even know when I'm going to start, but regardless, the job only pays $9/hour.\n\nI have to take the GRE in two days, and I've been so depressed that I haven't been able to study. I haven't been eating, and I just feel dizzy all the time and can't concentrate on anything. I feel like I'm actively ruining my future. Grad school was perhaps my only way out and I probably won't get in anywhere now 'cause I'm going to fuck up my GRE and it's all my fault. \n\nMy boyfriend and his parents recently said I could live with them. I really want to, but I'm just going to be a financial burden. I can't afford to pay for shit. And, my dad's currently paying for my car insurance and I can't afford that, and this city requires a car. The public transportation sucks and it's not walkable at all. And, I can't expect my boyfriend's family to pay for that. \n\nAnd I just finished getting into a huge argument with my dad about moving out with my boyfriend's family, where he basically invalidated all my feelings, acted like I'm some naive child who sees the world with rose-tinted glasses, and how I'm just going to be a financial drain on them, and how, if I move out, I'll see that living here isn't as bad as I think it is (I'm just an ungrateful child who doesn't appreciate his sacrifices) and how living at my boyfriend's parent's house will be so much worse.\n\nI can't take the stress anymore. I wish I was dead. I feel so hurt, and all I do is cry myself to sleep every night. I hate my life so much.\n\nI just tried eating something, and it wasn't even a binge, and I purged it. And, I'm not one to force myself to throw up all that often. My ED is becoming so much worse, and at this point, I don't even care if people know.

I don\u2019t agree with every little thing discussed on this podcast, but it is interesting as well as insightful. And if you\u2019re trying to gear yourself up for recovery, or even partial recovery, but are nervous or anxious about the process... give it a listen. It\u2019s called The Eating Disorder Recovery Podcast by Dr. Janean Anderson, who also struggled with an eating disorder and invites other professionals who have struggled and work in the field. So when you\u2019ve binged all of the SSvSS and 600 lb life, add this to your list.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

it's a lie. that couldn't make anyone happy. one time, i fasted for 5 days, and the entire time i was so heartbroken that i'd ever have to eat again. that isn\u2019t happiness, it can\u2019t be.\n\n  \nmy mother forced me to get lunch with her a few days ago, in town. i got a salad at a little cafe, and it was covered in oily salad dressing. and so i sat there, wiping every piece of lettuce and cucumber with a napkin to get the oil off. i looked absolutely ridiculous, i'm sure, but in that mindset you simply don't care. you just want to lose weight, you just want to eat less than yesterday, you like your fingertips being blue-tinged because it proves you're 'sick enough'. it is so irrational.  \nand yet, it gives me something to live for. it's something i'm achieving, even though realistically i'm not achieving anything at all. i very rarely want to die when i'm starving myself.  \nthe other side is the binging and purging. the absolute chaos. it's a complete lack of control, and so it's agonising in a different way. it makes me dangerously suicidal, because i feel like i've lost my grip on the main thing in my life, and so everything is useless.\n\n  \nin this state, food doesn't tend to rule my mind as much, apart from when i'm around it, because i\u2019ll have an insane binge.  \nonce i've purged, the whole day is set out to be just the same. last weekend, i was home alone for the entire day, and so i binged and purged nine times. it was ridiculous, definitely a personal best, and so so painful. i had so much i needed to do, and i didn't get it done because i was busy vomiting. it's just as time-consuming as starving myself, but not because i think so much about it. it simply takes up time. purging is exhausting, and so once i'm done, i'm usually burned out for the rest of the day. binging can be disturbing too. on occasions, i\u2019ve eaten until i can barely breathe or move, which on a scale of cool to not cool, is definitely Not Cool.\n\n  \nevery time i've stopped purging for a period of weeks or days, i've been really struck by just how much extra time it leaves me. of course, i don't put it to good use and instead watch mukbangs on youtube for hours, but it's always a shock to me. that's why it's often so hard to get out of the cycle, because it becomes part of my daily routine, and without it there's a very noticable vacancy.\n\n  \nsometimes, though, vomiting is 'enjoyable', in a fucked up way. one time, after a fast, i stole a tub of oreo icecream from my grandma's. i got home, ate it in a disturbingly short amount of time, and went to throw up. it sticks out in my mind, because it was a 'good purge'. i got it all up. i got to enjoy icecream, and then i got to be 'empty' as well. no anxiety, little guilt. times like that keep me from stopping entirely.\n\n  \ntruthfully, for every 'good purge', i have 100 extremely awful ones where i'm dripping bloody snot and tears all over the toilet, but they tend to all merge into one big memory. most purges are pretty unpleasant, especially if i waited too long and it\u2019s all acidic and painful.\n\n  \nit's just unbelievably chaotic. as it's something i always just 'have to do', i've purged in some pretty awful places during my eating disorder. to name a few, i've purged in public parks, alleyways, public bins, MANY public toilets, other people's houses, other peoples plastic bags in their houses. it isn't fun or easy. i don't know how i've kept it hidden this long, truthfully i think my immediate family know, but they don't know what to do.\n\n  \nand, the consequences are real. a while ago, i remember purging something i'd eaten two days prior. that really hit home, as before that i didn't really appreciate the damage i was doing to myself. for a while, my digestive system was VERY FUCKED INDEED, but most of the issues seem to have resolved themselves.\n\n  \nit's always either starving or binging or the two overlapping, and it has been that way for so long. normality is unrecognizable, i don't know how to do it. i don't know how to give up this absolute obsession and chaos. i want to, though. i want to get better, because i want normality again, but it feels hundreds of miles away. i think that in the future, no matter what, the need to control my food is always going to be on my mind, and it\u2019ll be easy for me to fall back into these behaviours.\n\n  \ni just don't know how to relearn eating.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

The psychiatrist said I was inches away from being put in the hospital with a feeding tube, but all of my labs were normal so they let me keep trying outpatient.\n\nI've already been to residential twice before and although it helps me gain the weight, it doesn't do anything to combat the disordered thoughts that eventually just lead me to lose weight again. It's essentially a game where I have to see how much weight I can lose before things start going really wrong, and only then it's okay to eat and gain weight again.\n\nI've been following the recovery meal plan that my dietitian gave me for two weeks now. I have no idea what my weight is because we've been doing blind weights, but the dietitian has told me that it's trending up and I'm \"doing well.\" My BMI was &gt;!15.2!&lt; when I got home; I'm terrified to know what it is now. I can see so much weight gain on my body already. How am I supposed to keep going up to &gt;!100!&lt; pounds? My dietitian even mentioned something today about how she'd tell me next week or in the future if my weight was going up too fast so that we could decrease my meal plan. That should be comforting, but instead I'm terrified that it's already going up really quickly and she just wants me to gain as much as possible.\n\nI'm eating because it's the only way to be allowed to go back to my summer internship on Friday, which is basically my dream job fully funded for ten weeks. Beyond that, I really do want to recover so that I can apply for jobs after this last year of college and actually live the life I've been missing out on for eight years.\n\nBut I feel hideous. I look terrible. No one at my college cares about me or even knows who I am. I really like this guy but he ghosted me this semester (apparently he took time off from school and I suspect some mental illness). I reached out the other day because his grandfather died and he seemed geniunely thankful that I did and we talked for a bit, but now I'm waiting on his reply again. I really want to get to know him but I'm afraid that I'm trying too hard or being annoying. This wouldn't happen to me if I was pretty.\n\nI'm not really sure what I need right now.

Ive been I\u2019ve been struggling with anxiety when I eat along with self hate. I have lost a lot of weight fast. And the last couple days I could barely force myself to eat. After nearly passing out several times, I forced down a breakfast shake and some baby snacks but all of a sudden I\u2019m on a binging war path. Like, wtf? I wanna just eat everything. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m not feeling sick anymore or anything. \n\nIs it normal to cycle back and forth?

I have no idea how many calories were in the gelato and because of that I NEED a buffer. So I am coming in about 200 calories under my daily budget according to my tracking, with the gelato estimate. Did I over estimate, hence my hunger; which is now a 7/10. Did I under estimate and therefore eating anything will send me into over eating for the day?! \n\nThis has been going on for hours now and I am exhausted. I want to honor my hunger. And I would if I knew where I was at for the day. The not knowing scares me and so I need this 200 cal buffer. Today was going fine until the hunger.

I need to find a solution or I'll probably end up dying due to health complications, sooner or later.\n\n---\n\nSo about me. I'm 26, had a fairly privileged upbringing, with some amazing parents that have given me intense inferiority issues. Last time I weight myself I was 420 pounds, but it's likely 430+ now.\n\nI've been overweight for as long as I can remember, probably since I was 10. Despite my parents best efforts to make sure I ate healthy foods, I would spend allowance on snacks (and later money from my part time job), and find food around the house that I would sneak to my room and eat on my own.\n\nAs I grew older, my social life dwindled, and now aside from my 3 roommates/best friends and family, I hate being around anyone. Due to low self-esteem and general image, I have a natural assumption I'm not all that pleasant to be around. Never had a girlfriend.\n\nJanuary 2016 was a tipping point into major depression, apathy, and lethargy. I spend all my time outside of work vegging out watching youtube, movies and shows I've already watched a dozen times, life simulator games, etc. Just stuff to turn my brain off. \n\nSaw a general doctor, counselor, and psychiatrist over the next year and got diagnosed for clinical depression, and got meds to inhibit reuptake of serotonin and neropenephrine. These helped with my mood and a little bit with productivity. For about 2 years now, I've been talking almost daily with a counselor to try to fix my bad habits and lose some weight. Since that started, I've gained a net 20 pounds at least. \n\nUntil about 3 weeks ago, I was trying to slowly make changes, like drinking water every day, going to the gym, stop going to fast food, not eating in my room, etc. Just things that I could make my new \"normal\" to avoid trying and failing at a diet for the hundredth time in my life.\n\nAnd I still messed up. As I implemented new rules, I kept finding ways around them to eat horrible food and be lazy, and if I couldn't find a loophole, sooner or later I would just straight up break the rule and gorge. So on my call with the counselor 3 weeks ago, I brought this up, pretty bummed I still couldn't get the hang of it. She said it's likely an issue with binge-eating disorder, that as I encounter more and more triggers in my life, eventually my infinitive thoughts shut down, leaving only impulses for comfort like binging food and vegging in front of TV. I agree with this point, it makes sense.\n\nAfter that talk though, I did some thinking, and I have to wonder just how I could get through something like this. Depression being the reason for my eating is one thing, the \"cure\" for that is medication and therapy. But for binge-eating, there's no real external force that I can change to stop it, it just relies on me, doing better or thinking of the right thing at the right time. I just don't believe I can do this after 16 years of failing to control myself around food. \n\nI guess something in me broke that day. I may have consciously thought \"I'll never get better, I give up,\" but unconciously, I always fought forward. Now I'm the opposite. I think my core, unconcious mind has finally given up, and my logical brain is fighting desperately to prove it wrong, to no success.\n\nNow I'm one absence away from being fired at work, and the effort I'm putting in there is abysmal, which could get me fired anyway. I spend all day laying around, mostly in bed, when out of work. I dont have a car right now, so I picked up the habit of ordering Postmates, and I've been using it practically twice a day. Between that and the weekly councelling charge, my bank account is depleting fast. I stopped going to the gym, talking with friends, or doing anything of substance whatsoever. I didnt renew my prescription for my medication and started going through some pretty intense withdrawals as well... It was pretty hellish.\n\nIt's been three weeks of this and I've seen my psychiatrist again to get new meds, and my withdrawal symptoms have receded. She's recommending seeing a binge-eating disorder specialist. I need to buy a car and find some time to get to them without missing work, and it's hard for me to go through that trouble in such a defeated state. I'm considering suspending my weekly councelling meetings to save up for that, since it's the biggest drain on my budget aside from food.\n\nEven with this, though, I feel no real hope. I feel like I'll probably just die soon from egregious weight issues or something if I dont stop myself. At the very least, I'll lose my job and have to move back in with my parents, which would be absolutely humiliating, as well as removing the last remaining positive trait I feel I have: not being a burden to friends/family/society.\n\nSo here I am, asking the question: Is there really any hope for me to be fixed? Is there some better answer than something amounting to \"Just do better\"?", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

In previous relapse and recovery periods, I was always a vegetarian. Never had a problem with this as my motivation was mainly based in a lifelong dislike of meat and some genuine sympathy for animals and the planet. Very very little of my vegetarianism was ever motivated by my eating disorder as I have been a vegetarian for as long as I can remember really.\n\nIt was during my current relapse in the last year that I became a vegan. I've explained my decision to a couple treatment professionals but not had the opportunity to really explore my feelings on it. What I maintain is that once I learned about the dairy industry, I couldn't feel morally right continuing to support it so I stopped. I decided to do this because it'd been something I considered for awhile but admittedly because it also shut off a lot of free food being offered to me. I felt safer in my disorder having less temptation from all the free cookies and pizza being given at school. \n\nHaving explained that to my team, I'm now being asked to challenge the choice because it's not being used solely as an activist decision. I see no reason why I should have to eat animal products if I get nutrition elsewhere. My labs are fine, I'm physically healthy really so why would I need to eat something our bodies don't naturally need? \n\nI have no fear foods, I have no problem eating highly calorific things. Our challenge snack today was pudding. I refused (but was forced to have 2 bites) because it had milk. I would eat any snack they gave me if it were vegan regardless of calories or anything. I just can't excuse it to myself to do something that doesn't seem necessary. \n\nI'm worried that by giving up veganism I'm morally valuing my enjoyment in something like cheese over a living creature. I could excuse it if it were necessary for my survival but it's really not. \n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nIs there a different way I can frame this without feeling like I'm looking for an excuse to eat something simply because I like it more than I care about the animal? What do you think of anorexia as a medical reason as to why you *can't* be vegan? I've never agreed with that but now it seems like I'd have to in order to be able to do something I'm uncomfortable with. Do you think I should continue insisting to my team that I'm not doing it for restriction the majority of the time but because of ethical value? Is there some sort of compromise I could come to terms with that I'm not considering because of the classic black and white thinking? Be real, do I sound like I'm bullshitting myself?", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I'm currently at a lower/normal weight and my doctor said I will probably stay in the same range, but I'm still horrified of what might happen.\n\nI've been eating a healthy diet - very small portions multiple times a day. It is probably not enough, but at the moment it helps me from not feeling so sickly full that I physically can not keep food down - or eating \"forbidden food\" causing me to fall out of my recovery. I'm hoping to gradually increase my intake without bombarding myself with big amounts of food that I'm not use too. \n\nI'm scared to see the scales moves up, so I'm trying to prepare myself, and understand what is happening and why so that I don't get scared and take a step backwards. \n\nWhat are some things I should expect to see happen to my body and on the scales within the next month or two?\n\nAny comments are greatly appreciated.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

I don't like talking about my eating disorder on my main cus people I know can see :(\n\nOkay so pretty much just the title. Is this possible? I never went through this in the weight regain phase, but I'm highly suspecting that I am going through it now even though I didn't think it could happen this late, and I'm not sure it even makes sense.\n\nSo I have been weight restored for nearly a year now. I recovered to a pretty high weight, not gonna lie to ya. I recovered into the overweight category of BMI. I accepted it though mainly because my docs (GP and ED consultant) both told me, it isn't necessarily unhealthy for an individual to be in 25-29 BMI range, it's a 'case by case' thing at that range and in my 'case' it would be healthier for me to maintain it than pursue weight loss because of my eating disorder. So if my doctors are saying it, then I decided to trust the health professionals even though I did not like it and felt puffy and pasty and bloated and fat. I stuck it out and didn't give into weight loss temptation.\n\nI had been eating as usual for months, maintaining this weight, feeling better and getting my life back together. Yadda yadda. Then about a month ago I am suddenly hungrier, and eating more, but having symptoms exactly like a checklist for hypermetabolism and this past week I've noticed somehow lost weight. I am not weighing myself but visually I can't help but think I see it, and some clothes seem to be looser too. \n\nBody has also changed shape. Stomach a bit flatter out of the blue, boobs have filled out a little, hips curvier too, face has slimmed down a little (which is huge for me to notice, because I am extremely picky and anxious about my fat face and double chin and have never been able to see it otherwise). \n\nMy hair is falling out again a little bit which is weird, but I'm still getting my period which I know is a good sign. I'm absolutely NOT restricting again, I am hungrier as I said and eating a lot. It's not like extreme hunger but its enough that it's hard to keep up with my hunger.\n\nI know the clever answer is 'go back to the doctor' but honest with you guys I am so fed up of doctors now, I've had to deal with doctors for years. And. More importantly to me. I have this gut feeling. You know when your gut tells you that something like a symptom or feeling is because of your eating disorder? I'm getting that about all this, despite the fact I am technically past recovered now.\n\n**Also I aint even mad tbh**. I don't feel great day-to-day physically, but something feels like it's shifting and it's a good thing. I think.

This is the original post:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/bu30f4/just_got_diagnosed_for_the_first_time_mixed/\n\nSo, I saw the school doctor I was referred to. She said that, in her opinion, she doesn\u2019t think they can provide the level of care I need based on my vitals. She thinks I need, at the very least, intensive outpatient or partial hospitalization, but I might even need inpatient (huge problem because I no longer have health insurance, which I told her once she said that). But, she\u2019s going to meet with the team after my appointment with the dietician and my second appointment with my therapist. And, she referred me for lab testing and a cardiology appointment that I need to get done before I see her again in two weeks.\n\nShe said my vitals were extremely unstable and concerning \u2014 very high tachycardia and bad orthostatic hypotension. She said she was also concerned about a possible arrhythmia based on what she listened of my heart with the stethoscope. \n\nShe wants me to stop drinking water and only drink juice and things like Boost and Ensure. She also wants me to try upping my calories to 1000-1200 a day, which is still too low, but that\u2019s where she wants to start me off.\n\nShe thinks I\u2019m very motivated, so they\u2019ll assess whether they can treat me, but she\u2019s extremely concerned based on her assessment. She thinks the severity of my symptoms is quite high.\n\nShe was trying not to cry multiple times throughout my session. I think she felt very strongly for me. It felt like a therapy appointment. She asked a lot of questions about my family life, history of the disorder, relationships, etc. Really seemed like she cared.\n\nApparently my therapist had called her right before I went in to talk about me, and he told her I was very motivated. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m quite scared. I didn\u2019t think I was this bad (I always thought I wasn't sick enough -- even now, I still kind of do), and I\u2019m terrified of inpatient. I can\u2019t afford it, and my parents don\u2019t even know I have an ED. This is the first time in my life doctors have ever taken me seriously, and it\u2019s an interesting shift. I feel validated, but the things they tell me are hard to hear. \n\nI was hospitalized at the ER three years ago for the same symptoms (tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, low magnesium), and she found it surprising they didn\u2019t do a psych referral \u2018cause I displayed classic physical symptoms of anorexia. Just goes to show how incompetent some doctors are.\n\nI really, really hope they decide to treat me. Honestly, the threat of inpatient might just be my biggest motivator to get better. What if they decide I\u2019m too high of a medical risk? I\u2019m so worried.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

(sucks that I have to type everything and this is not a live conversation, loads that could be discussed)So I've never been diagnosed but I am pretty positive I have an eating disorder which is like a child of OCD, anorexia and binge eating, i try to do IF as well, but I feel like it makes everything worse (esp. w/ OCD). And the thing is, I feel like I use this as a way to distract myself from the fact that I have to do something of value in this world.  Some days just feel like I just wake up and I have nothing to do and no one to meet up with and nobody to talk to. And also I feel like I fail to commit to things, which just adds to the \"I don't have anything to do\". Damn it is so so so complex at this point, I have no clue how to fit everything in here. It limits me so so so much. I  lost some weight and now I am afraid to wear tight clothes just because I don't want people to see by body in case I gain weight in the near future. With IF its like okay, I eat 12-20, so if there's a thing happening from lets say 17-20 I may just not go at all (because while Im home aka 16 its to early to eat and after 20 it will be too late) or I just shove a bunch of food that I don't even want before leaving as I am afraid that if I don't eat anything I'll feel hungry (I get migraines if I starve myself and lose sleep). I just find it hard to believe that if all this crazy mindset was not here I'd be able' to feel fulfilled and happy, though I understand that that's probably how it works. But if I ate \"only when I am hungry\" then... I don't know.. I would never eat? And if I never eat, then what to do during the day?  It's so complicated to explain what's going on inside of my brain, but maybe someone is going through smth similar OR ESPECIALLY has overcame it? I feel like my migraines traumatized me kinda, now I am afraid to get hungry. And then you combine it with binge eating... Also there's an entire thing with drinking water too. I try to drink as much as possible, and then I go to pee like every 10seconds. Yes, I do that outside of my house too, which greatly limits me too. \"what if there won't be a toilet\" \"what if I wont be able to find tap water there\". Going to nature? means ill probably carry around 2l of water in my backpack. Jesus christ why can't i be a normal person. Are there any normal people though? So yeah. And I am just afraid I won't have any ideas. any  activities if I lost all of these thoughts.  I am so so sorry this is so long.

And I\u2019m tripping balls right now.", "author": "arwenstrife", "self_text": "Sorry for the wall of text; brevity has never been my strong suit. I also just feel very strongly... Cray about this.\n\nSo last night I went out to a bar with my boyfriend and for some reason we started talking about what hunger feels like. Imagine my shock when he tells me he DOESN'T FEEL hunger pangs. He says hunger for him is purely mental, and that any physical cues are just the feeling of an empty stomach or maybe feeling a little weaker when he's hungry. But other than that it's all in his head.\n\nI was shocked. I told him that I get hunger pangs 2-4 times a day, and that it hurts, and feels like sharp contractions on an empty stomach. Or a gnawing feeling, sometimes accompanied by grumbling noises. It's uncomfortable and hurts, but usually goes away after a couple minutes.\nHe said that his whole life he thought hunger pangs were something you only experienced if you were starving yourself for days or weeks on end, and that people were just exaggerating when they talked about it, and that he personally had NEVER experienced it.\n\nSo I said he was weird and we Googled hunger pangs and what hunger is. Because I always thought that hunger was the physical pain and that anything else was just, like, a food craving? He agreed that maybe he was weird, but then we proceeded to quiz everybody for the rest of the night to see if he was the odd one out.\n\n\nMale Lyft Driver: \"No, I don't feel pain when I'm hungry. But I OMAD.\" I OMAD as well and the hunger pains have never gone away.\n\nFemale Bartender: \"Nope, don't feel hunger pangs.\"\n\nMale Friend #1: \"Ever since I\u2019ve really gotten used to fasting in the mornings, I don\u2019t really hurt when I\u2019m hungry. I\u2019m just like, 'Huh I should eat.'\" Cue my meltdown over FB Messenger. \"If it makes you feel better, I remember feeling this way when I was younger.\"\n\nMale Friend #2: \"Nah. I don\u2019t feel hunger pains. I haven\u2019t for years. The only time I feel them is during cases of extreme and intense hunger but that never happens haha.\" Cue angry react. \"Idk, I think I just got used to being hungry.\"\n\nMale Friend #3: \"I mean my stomach grumbles but it typically doesn\u2019t hurt. Maybe it\u2019s cause I used to fast 30 days a year.\" But he only intermittent fasts for Ramadan, which is basically what I do every day.\n\nSo my female friend privately messaged me and said: \"Hunger for me is honestly a full body experience. Probably because of my health issues. I\u2019ve done fasting before because of how much my stomach would hurt just all the time but hunger is definitely something that deeply affects me. Don\u2019t let the men make you feel bad! They\u2019re trying to be tough and it\u2019s bullshit!!\" But she admittedly has digestive problems.\n\n\nThe reason I've been mentioning genders in these responses is because my boyfriend has mentioned in the past that he was sympathetic towards hunger for his girl friends because it was more of an \"ordeal\" for them. And now we've finally maybe figured out why. I thought it was maybe a girl thing but then the bartender last night said she didn't feel hunger pains either. (For me, it's like a \"NEED FOOD NOW\" kind of alarm going off in my body, but then it goes away after a bit and then I'm not \"hungry\" anymore? I will still eat obvi, lol.)\n\nSo I'm sort of tripping balls right now because out of the majority of the people I've asked since last night, hunger is not a physical thing for them. I know hunger can be mental (and it really is for me), but it's so shocking to me that it isn't ever a physical thing for so many people. I definitely have gotten better at ignoring the hunger or just fighting through it from doing OMAD, but it still happens at least twice a day. And the mental cravings of course are very difficult to ignore. \n\nI just wanted to hear from others... Do you guys feel discomfort or pain (like sort of a stomach cramp) when you are hungry? How often? Did you guys know about this? Is this super wack? Was I just dealt a crappy hand in life? This is wack, right??", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I clearly remember being young and comparing myself to my older sister and being super proud of myself that I was skinnier then her (there\u2019s a 6 year difference between me and her) I also remember having this period of time (maybe two years) were I\u2019d \u201ccontrol\u201d myself with food as in even if I was hungry I wouldn\u2019t eat unless it was breakfast, lunch or dinner also keep in mind this was before I was even in grade one (in my country we start school when we are 6 years old) I used to think \u201cdamn I\u2019m hungry but that\u2019s good because that means I\u2019m gonna lose weight so I should try to not eat even more\u201d and honestly it seems really fucked up that a kid younger then 6 is having this kinds of thoughts and I don\u2019t even understand we\u2019re they came from because I don\u2019t think anyone is fatshaming a kid younger then 6 years old.\n\nThe interesting thing is that when I was 8 years old I started dabling in eating disorders I had no idea what they were because what 8 year old is taught about eating disorders, so when I was 8 I just stopped having all the food I\u2019d normally eat for lunch I\u2019d just have this really small bowl of carrot scrapes at the time it must have been a bit bigger then my own hand but if I remember correctly the bowl wouldn\u2019t even be as big as the palm of my hand and I only had that for lunch for about 6 months (my breakfast would only be a mug of milk with some sugar and I\u2019d just have whatever my parents were having for dinner) once again my thought process was that \u201cI\u2019m fat so it\u2019s fine if I don\u2019t eat a lot for lunch it might even make me thinner which would be great\u201d which once again seems so messed up for an 8 year old to think this I only stopped doing this because my teachers realized I was losing weight fast so they watched me during lunch and I guess they realized I was only eating carrot scrapes so they told my parents and they started giving me home food. \n\nBut when I was 13 I really dove head first into the pool of eating disorders, I stopped having breakfast (also once again I still wasn\u2019t taught about what eating disorders were) during the summer because I panicked and thought \u201cohh god I have to lose weight as fast as I can\u201d so when school started I just started not having lunch I don\u2019t remember if I still didn\u2019t have breakfast but I remember I started doing sit-ups at night about 130 each night even though I barely had any energy, I think there was a period were I just had dinner at night and this was when I was about 13-14 years old and to be honest when I think back on myself I still feel this sense of proudness of myself like I managed to complied this sick little achievement but all of that came into a big conclusion when right at the end of the school year my supposed best friend made a fat joke about me \u201cthe board cleaner is anti-fat maybe we should give some to *me* she seems to need it\u201d that moment fucking wrecked me I had been suffering so much for the past year to the point of almost passing out on one occasion and almost being sent to the hospital but still people seemed to hate me for the way I looked and that just fucking wrecked me as soon as I was out of class I started crying to the point I had a panic attack once the friend realized what I was going through she did apologize but part of me just never managed to forgive them\n\nEven now as a 16 year old I\u2019m not healthy I have about 8,4 kg of extra weight I hate myself a lot for that I still struggle a lot and obsess with my weight a lot to the point I just wanna go back to having an eating disorder, I don\u2019t know why but I just wanna go back to starving myself and going to the gym at the same time I have never been at a healthy weight I hate myself for that and I just feel like I\u2019m never ever gonna be able to handle weight like a normal person does and like I\u2019ll always be obsessing with it for the rest of my life also I just don\u2019t understand were all this horrible feelings came from and why even as a 4 year old I was already thinking about losing weight.e", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

She has struggled constantly in the past with restricting, bingeing, purging, and feeling like she has an addiction to food. In the past, she lost weight by using meth and Adderall, but has now been sober from all substances for over 2 years (we are sober together, actually.) So it seemed like a great idea when she adopted healthy eating and started to be more physically active because she was taking care of her health, and I thought that her success in sobriety would somehow translate to this.\n\nThings started to change when she stopped attending regular recovery meetings with me, and said that she needed to go to the gym instead. She told me that once she got to a certain weight, she wouldn't have to prioritize exercise as much but that the gym was what was making her happy for now. I was a little worried, but I let her do her thing. We stopped hanging out and just chilling in a relaxing way. Eventually every time we hung out it had to include her getting a certain amount of steps or exercise in, and the conversation was no longer about funny things, our emotions, or anything, it became solely based on ingredients of food, calories, WW points, etc. It was getting exhausting to keep up with what she was saying, and since I struggled with body image in the past too, I was not comfortable hearing it. Still I just tried to comfort her every time she would tell me how she was worried she would gain weight by eating a few chips, or a bite of something, or not going to the gym for one day. Our texts, which used to be lighthearted, became all about her telling me what foods she was going to cut out. When she told me she was going to cut out fruit entirely because it would make her gain weight, that's when I knew something was really wrong.\n\nHer periods stopped, and her blood pressure and heart rate have dropped below normal range. She feels dizzy and can't concentrate. Her employer had to sit down with her because they were worried about her not eating, and also since she was not doing her job at her desk (she's a receptionist) because she would spend the time getting steps in or climbing up to 50 flights of stairs per day. The hard part is, her body type is still technically \"overweight\", but I can literally see her body shut down before my eyes. And her mental state is shutting down even faster. She will text or call me about how hungry she is, but that she's hungry because she's \"addicted to food\" and she doesn't see that she's not eating enough. She says that she will only go to seek any treatment options if it abides by her gym schedule. She cried on the phone with me last week because she was scared that she'd gain weight from the skin on a cucumber, and that's really when I started thinking of maybe having an intervention.\n\nShe's convinced that since she's not \\*physically\\* anorexic, that she's not at risk of serious health concerns, and that her mental state is just something she has to deal with, and when she gets to be a certain weight it will all go away. I can't deal with this anymore and I want my best friend back.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

Sorry if this is triggering but I won't be putting my weights here since I usually avoided the scale for the most part out of fear anyways. This is also kind of long and I might not put a TLDR at the end because this is really personal and I don't know how to really sum it all up..\n\n\nSo. This started at a very young age. Like, thing 1st grade. I had a really stressful life and I gained weight easily and kept it because I was stressed being the child of a single mother who wasn't really there emotionally. My mom has always kept me at arms length, I realized out of resentment because she had me 2 months after her 16th birthday. That said, she had an eating disorder when I was about 10/11 and heavily shamed me and encouraged me to also have an eating disorder. The bullying at home was horrible and it never stopped and I had no where to go to escape. So, when I was 13-15 I was anorexic with a serious exercise addiction (think like 11 hours a day during the summer/weekends and 4 to 5 hours on school days ). I lost a lot of weight. In fact, a disturbing amount of weight. No one said anything about it except encouragement while still tormenting me about being chubby. Needless to say, I gave up with severe depression and gained weight back. All my  family told me was that they were dissapointed in me for gaining weight back despite dropping 5 sizes in 2 months not too long before. No one has ever really cared enough to notice red flags in my health. My life was like this: I go to school, I get food thrown at me and get names thrown at me from others passing by me every day. I go home and I get told I'm a stupid, ugly, and fat dissapointed by my own mother. I'm not even exaggerating here. It was like this every single day. I became a recluse from a really young age because I never really had friends and my family hated me. I was a quiet type that studied really hard and enjoyed art. I lived on the beach in Southern California and rarely went. I never did sports because people always pointed and laughed at me. I got so tired if this little bitch and her clique pointing and laughing at me in the locker rooms that I one day lost my shit (this was previously going on for 6 months and I told all authorities. They never did anything.) and I bashed her head into the lockers. I had to have 7 or 8 people, including the gym teacher, pull me off of her. No one really teased me close enough after that. I felt a little better despite being suspended and she was not punished. I started purging in 7th grade and all through out high school because I had developed an anxiety disorder where I was constantly having a panic attack. I couldn't stand to eat a lot. I took as many weight loss supplements as possible. Again, I had no idea what any mental illnesses were and everyone ignored it. I never got treatment for any thing until I was about 19. Even then, I only treated my symptoms: anxiety and depression. I was diagnosed with possibly having borderline personality disorder, though I still don't understand what it is. I kind of don't want to tbh. Anyways, I recently started purging on the regular again because I gained a lot of weight and I just kind of fell back into my unhealthy ways with restricting, meticulous calorie counting, purging, and exercising as much as I can. I still get shit for being fat but not as much because I deleted all social media and I am a recluse except for work. I never hang out anywhere. I have no friends. That's just kind of my life right now. Um, I don't know how to end this but this was my story I guess. I just wanted someone to know. I don't expect anyone to give this any time, but if you did I want to thank you for reading. :)\n\n\nEdit: changed BPD to borderline personality disorder because I wasn't sure that was the right acronym.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

My younger SIL (17F) has been showing signs/risks that I, and research in general, link to developing an eating disorder. She has low self esteem at times, thinks she is \"fat\" even though she is a healthy weight for her height and is active in sports at school, has tried diets with her mother (which is a WHOLE separate can of worms we don't need to open right now), intermittent fasting with her father, spends a lot of time on Instagram looking at models and \"health/fitness\" accounts (that brag about vitamins and dietary supplements/diarrhea tea \ud83d\ude44), and numerous other criteria.\n\nMost recently what I've been concerned about is that she told me she started calorie counting in an effort to \"eat better\", which *yes* can work for some people, but for the people I know, it has led to restricting. I said something along the lines of, \"Oh, calories are just an energy measurement, you really want to look more at the nutritional aspects like protein, carbs, sodium, vitamins, and such. Don't bother with calories if you can help it, it'll just stress you out\" and she just kind of shrugged it off and went on eating her pizza slice.\n\nToday she informed that she's going vegetarian after seeing a video in her health class about how big companies treat and prepare animals they intend to sell for meat. Again, this would be understandable under normal circumstances, but to me it more like another way she could start to eat less and therefore lose weight/\"be healthy\".\n\nI'm just really scared for her, and I don't want her to go down the same path that I did when I was in high school. I don't know how to go about helping her before it's too late. I guess I could start by telling her  about my personal experiences with anorexia and bulimia, but I really don't know...\n\n\n\nTLDR; afraid my SIL will develop an ED, she shows lots of signs that can lead to one; is currently calorie counting and vegetarian; I don't know what to do or how to help her before shit hits the fan", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I was 100 lbs at 5'7 and was going to be dropping more (I'm classified as avoidant). Throughout 4? months I gained 45 lbs. This was the first time I ever had been at such a healthy weight, 118 was my best before that at one point. I found that this medication caused me to feel hunger on a mental scale and I consumed food everyday and without any problems.   \n\n\nThing is I lost a lot of it during some point and I suspect it's because I started messing around with the medication and brought the dosage down. I currently sit at around 119 or so. My big problem is I miss wanting to eat regularly and without all the mental problems that I face when I go to eat. I also, as crazy as it sounds, want to be around 155/160(?) at highest. I can't stand seeing my body and only seeing an anorexic image. I know I'm not that but I feel insecure that I'm not pudgy and instead so frail looking. I love looking like I got meat on me and if anything extra cushion. idk if it's possible even cause I'm considered tall for a female and have a petite physique but inside I'm desperate. I'm guessing if I were able to eat regularly and everyday I wouldn't look so frail?  \n\n\nSo TLDR: Has anyone increased dosage on an anti psychotic with weight gain as a side effect in order to put on pounds? is it a real bad idea to be consuming one for that as a main reason even though it's what that psych decided on? is it possible to do this, to gain weight increasingly, possibly past what I was at before or is it literally just up to me and not up to the side effect? I'm also guessing it might not work because I think side effects go away after a while but I personally don't categorize this as one.", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

My post on here may be a bit different considering I see most people talking about how they're going through a rough time with anorexia or such. For me, I have the opposite problem. Ever since I was a child, I have always been overweight and obsessed with food. My days revolve around eating. As I grew up I realized I was different from the other kids because they could ride bikes and they could go running around and play sports. I couldn't do that with them. When I went on a field trip to a amusement park, they told me I couldn't get on a ride with my friend because I was too fat and he was too skinny compared to me to be on the ride safely. By the time I hit 6th grade, I was in extra large clothes. My parents tried their best to help but even they couldn't stop my eating habits. I ate according to times, not according to when I was hungry. I ate and ate and ate until I would almost throw up. I didn't go to many field trips because of my size. I didn't try exercise or dieting because I figured I was already hopeless. I have suffered many indignities because of my weight. As you can imagine I was bullied a lot as a child, and therefore developed a sense of humor as a bubble to try and shield myself from the hurtful comments made towards me. My friends parents would refer to me always as, \"the fat kid.\" They wouldn't want to invite me over due to a fear that I would break their furniture. I tried many times in my high school years to diet, to lose all of this weight. But Everytime the food would draw me back. Finally, in my past senior year, I didn't go to my gradnite or prom because I didn't wanna embarrass myself on a ride or on a dance floor. My weight has always held me back. Now I am 17, pushing on the verge of 450 pounds, and am once again trying my best to diet and exercise to lose this weight. I am fresh out of high school with no plans for college yet as I wanted to lose weight before I would go. But I am so afraid. Afraid that I will fall off my diet like I always do. Afraid that I will never shed off my weight. Afraid of just dying of a heart attack in my sleep or injuring myself because of my weight. I need help. Any help at all that any of you can give. Any help that might be able to make me change myself. And advice for me to take. Just anything at all. I don't wanna be in this alone. Please. If anyone can take the time to just read this and offer me something at all to help with my weight loss, I'll take it happily. I just want to be normal for once in my life. I never got that chance as a kid. I want that chance as an adult for the rest of my life. Thank you. \n\nMay I post this or what can I do?", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

After my father and mother were arrested, my sister and I spent the next couple of years bouncing around in foster care we were legal age. Now we live in an apartment together. \n\nNeedless to say, we've been through ALOT together and Im very proud of how much we've overcome and how close we are BUT we still are struggling. \n\nWe both have had our respective eating disorders for years and since we've moved in together we've tried to hold eachother accountable but we fail at it so badly. \n\nI generally make us dinner and while i try to limit my eating and encourage her to eat, we generally tend to fall back on old habits. Il eat my meal very fast while i watch her pick at it and not even eat a nibble. Eventually, she'll just convince me to eat her plate as she once again skips a meal. Generally, the only time she does eat is when she brings home takeout from somewhere. However, she only like to take a bite or two just to taste in and then convinces me to eat the rest. Its a vicious cycle where i keep getting bigger and she keeps getting smaller. \n\nI feel like shit every time but I just see her uneaten food and i just want to eat it. and she knows i'll happily eat it, so she encourages me to. I dont think either of us are bad people but i do think we both realize our vices and we tend to use them to sabotage each other (and thats horrible). \n\nI dont know how to maneuver this or handle this and im just so scared. Despite us being twins, i've always been kind of the \"big sister\" of us and i just feel so much pressure to not only help myself but my sister as well. \n\nAnd (and im sure you have already picked up on this), we have a very co-dependent and borderline unhealthy relationship. We not only share a studio apartment but we also still sleep in the same bed. Trust me, I know we're a bit too old for that but since we were kids, we both found comfort sleeping in the same bed and we really haven't grown out of it. During all those years we were abused, we atleast took comfort in knowing we had each other. It was the only comfort we had. \n\n(Sleeping near eachother also helps when either one of us has PTSD induced panic attack late at night. That way we can comfort one another just in case)  \n\nI know we need help but We dont really have family anymore, and lord knows we cant afford treatment or therapy, so idk what to do.

In elementary school, I obsessively overate, and was one of the largest kids in the class. In middle school, I abruptly stopped eating and shed nearly half my weight in a few months. I remained anorexic well into college, until my then-boyfriend began to cook with me which quelled my fear of food. Up until recently, I maintained a \u201cslim\u201d figure on my 5\u2019 11\u201d frame, with restriction and exercise the backbone of my existence. I entered another long-term relationship where my diet was overturned (I was a vegetarian of 8 years with disordered habits) and entered a social sphere with my partner where drinking beer, and lots of it, was encouraged. We ate and drank and ate and drank and I slowly gained back the weight that would send me to a BMI bordering between \u201chealthy\u201d and \u201coverweight \u201c. I felt confident in my changing body, holding on to the praise I received from my partner about how much \u201cbetter\u201d I looked, and thought I had finally beat my eating disorder. The relationship ended explosively rounding the 5 year mark, and my self-confidence in what I ate and how I viewed my body, went right out the window. In the 12 months after the relationship ended, I ate emotionally, continued to drink, stopped commuter biking as I once religiously did, and broke my ankle in a fall traversing uneven sidewalk - the cherry on top. I had surgery, 1 plate and 9 screws, and was bedridden for three weeks.\n\nI literally did not, nor could not, walk for 3 months, slowly became active in physical therapy for another 2 months, began walking casually around 5 months post-surgery, and just got on my bike for the first time in 8 months\nyesterday. In that time, I\u2019ve gained weight in places I\u2019ve never had weight before, it pains me to feel my body move in an unfamiliar way to make room for the new parts of me that now exist. I avoid looking at mirrors, no pictures allowed, and am terrified to try on my summer staples because I know they won\u2019t fit. My closet taunts me, the old photographs of \u201cthin\u201d me send me into self-deprecating spirals, and the confidence I once thought I had not so long ago, had been replaced by an underlying disdain for myself. I\u2019ve quit attending social events because I\u2019m so disgusted with my appearance, I spend most my time sleeping. I value myself less because of my weight gain.\n\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve hit rock bottom, but I know that I will go even lower if I don\u2019t make changes now. So, I\u2019ve begun to get back on the bike and strive to adopt perspectives that won\u2019t feed into my disordered black and white thinking. Hard part is, it\u2019s either all or nothing, all the time. A large of my excuse for not addressing my health is because I\u2019m afraid I will slip back into another anorexia and over-exercising phase.\n\nWondering if anyone has suggestions on how to navigate how to maintain a healthy body despite being someone that will always struggle with an eating disorder?\n\nAlso looking for good reads on the subject as well.\n\nThank you.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

My younger SIL (17F) has been showing signs/risks that I, and research in general, link to developing an eating disorder. She has low self esteem at times, thinks she is \"fat\" even though she is a healthy weight for her height and is active in sports at school, has tried diets with her mother (which is a WHOLE separate can of worms we don't need to open right now), intermittent fasting with her father, spends a lot of time on Instagram looking at models and \"health/fitness\" accounts (that brag about vitamins and dietary supplements/diarrhea tea \ud83d\ude44), and numerous other criteria.\n\nMost recently what I've been concerned about is that she told me she started calorie counting in an effort to \"eat better\", which *yes* can work for some people, but for the people I know, it has led to restricting. I said something along the lines of, \"Oh, calories are just an energy measurement, you really want to look more at the nutritional aspects like protein, carbs, sodium, vitamins, and such. Don't bother with calories if you can help it, it'll just stress you out\" and she just kind of shrugged it off and went on eating her pizza slice.\n\nToday she informed that she's going vegetarian after seeing a video in her health class about how big companies treat and prepare animals they intend to sell for meat. Again, this would be understandable under normal circumstances, but to me it more like another way she could start to eat less and therefore lose weight/\"be healthy\".\n\nI'm just really scared for her, and I don't want her to go down the same path that I did when I was in high school. I don't know how to go about helping her before it's too late. I guess I could start by telling her about my personal experiences with anorexia and bulimia, but I really don't know...\n\nTLDR; afraid my SIL will develop an ED, she shows lots of signs that can lead to one; is currently calorie counting and vegetarian; I don't know what to do or how to help her before shit hits the fan", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

This was for sure what was causing my weight gain along side barely leaving the house.\n\nFollowing a break up with my first boyfriend at 16 me and my mother decided to go on a health mission. We began running regularly and joined a local weight loss group. We both lost weight FAST. And they rewarded us each an everytime; stickers and ribbons littered my weight loss diary. I lost nearly 5 stone in 2.5 months, combined we lost nearly 8 stone between us. \n\nIt was extraordinary and we both looked and felt amazing but we were getting sick of having to meet up for 2 hours every week to weigh-in and didnt want to keep a log book of everything we ate. It was so maticulous and precise. As we got rewarded the more we lost and I would often beat my self up if I put on 1/2 pound. So we left the group and felt well equipped we could keep up the fitness and health by ourselves. \n\nI even got approached by their magazine and was asked to do an interview as I recieved a 'Women of The Year award for how well I had done. \n\nWith all this in mind, back to the present day. I feel very unformfortable weighing my self, talking about weight and dieting isnt ideal either. She knows this as I am very open with her about what makes me comfortable. \n\nWhen we left the group I was significantly lighter. But here's the thing, I haven't purged regularly for over a month (except 1 relapse) and my mother knows this but she's also noticed Ive gained weight. She sees this as me being unhealthy despite knowing this.\n\nI feel healthy, I have my periods back to normal again and feel I have a positive outlook on life in general and I am trying everyday to love my self a little more. It's even harder when you KNOW you've gained and trying to untangle that weight doesn't equal to worth is very hard in itself let alone trying to like you self. Its very tiring and she doesn't seem to realise.\n\nShe keeps sending me pictures of when I was super skinny saying \"Oo look what I found, you're gorgeous in this\". I obv took this as, \"well you look good there but not now\". And keeps on sending me links to videos of \"fit and fearless\" people. She has also asked if I wanna rejoin the group again and again. \n\nI really do understand that she's trying to help but I can't help thinking this is really insensitive? I am trying to be happy how I am and accepting my self. I DO do exercise when my back allows me too I go on walks. But that's me. That's all I can do right now. I just think she's trying to morph me into someone I'm not. \n\nHow do I bring this up without her taking offence?

I reached out to friends, my boyfriend, and my mom to tell them what\u2019s going on and get support. I am very close with my mom and she was away on vacation the last two weeks, which was when my disorder got to the breaking point, so that was really hard. I also want to add that my mom is a dietician specializing in eating disorders (her specialty is adolescents and I\u2019m 25, so I\u2019m a little outside her area but she still obviously knows a lot). I knew she would be able to help me in a way no one else in my support system would be able to, so I have been desperate for her to return from her trip. We live in different states for the time being, but at least when she\u2019s home I can FaceTime her. \n\nI think in large part because of my mom\u2019s job and specialty I always thought I would be immune to eating disorders. I thought she had raised me to be confident enough in my body and to have a healthy attitude towards food, because she told me and others how she was deliberately trying to do that because she wanted to protect me. But I\u2019ve been living far from home for 2 years now, and a few months ago my eating disorder hit hard. I had gained some weight since college, and I saw the scale hit a new number last February and it triggered me to be dead set on losing weight as quickly as possible, with my goal being what I weighed in high school. I started doing intermittent fasting, and increased from 12 hour fasts to 16 hours to 18 hours to only eating once per day if at all. I looked in the mirror and was happy with my progress at first but it was never enough. I still haven\u2019t reached my initial \u201cgoal weight\u201d but I do weigh about what I did in junior/senior year of high school. I also know that dropping those last few pounds to achieve it wouldn\u2019t be enough. I can see and feel the bottom of my rib cage, but a voice in my head is telling me I need to be able to see each individual rib to be thin enough.\n\nI know that\u2019s not true and I know I should stop losing, and I am working on getting help. I mentioned earlier that my mom and I live in different states for the time being, and that is ending soon. I\u2019m moving back to my home state for medical school in less than 3 weeks. The great thing about that is that I\u2019ll have more support so so soon, and my mom has the knowledge and connections to get me the care I need. The bad thing about that is that there\u2019s not much point in trying to see a professional where I currently live since I\u2019m leaving so soon. Which means I\u2019m stuck in this limbo of knowing I need help but not getting it for a few more weeks, and I could use advice on strategies for how to cope in the meantime. My life here has been so stressful recently, and my eating disorder became my way of coping. But now I don\u2019t know how to cope with the eating disorder. The temptation is to start restricting again, but I know logically that won\u2019t help even though the voice in my head is saying it\u2019s the only thing that\u2019ll make me feel better. \n\nAlso I\u2019ve started having some negative health effects, including easy bruising, fainting/loss of consciousness, and near constant lightheadedness. Losing consciousness and ending up on the floor in pain with no idea how I got there was terrifying and made me feel so confused, scared, and helpless. \n\nNow that I know I have a problem and have been trying to get help, a lot of my friends and family have said that since I know I should eat more I can just do it, and that it\u2019s not a real mental illness but a lifestyle choice. Yesterday I got really upset with my boyfriend for telling me I have a choice in how eating makes me feel even though he knows it \u201cseems\u201d like I don\u2019t. The only one who seems to remotely understand is my mom, but she hasn\u2019t gone through it herself so she only knows secondhand. It leaves me in a lonely place.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

I was on Wellbutrin for a solid six months about three years ago, coinciding with a major life change. I stopped binging but restricted and purged, but I don\u2019t remember what my feelings were like towards my ED at the time.\n\nFast forward to today. I went back on Wellbutrin about a month ago, and my B/P episodes really ramped up about three months ago. In the past two weeks, B/P is no longer enjoyable. I still have the desire to engage, but the binge itself feels hollow. I no longer am getting the same relief from it that I once was. Purging and restricting still bring the same good feelings, though.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? I know Wellbutrin is used for BED, so I guess it makes sense that it would make the binges less enjoyable. Also \u2013 I know Wellbutrin is contraindicated with bulimia, and I know the dangers.

I've been with my SO for several years, and he is aware of my history and has always been extremely supportive and helpful. For over a year, I had been \"clean,\" with no purging for 13 months, and had gained some weight to a healthy weight. My partner was aware of my progress and very proud of me. Unfortunately, I've had a backslide and struggled with binging and purging again. This has been going on for a few months now. Initially I didn't tell my SO because I was hoping it would be a \"one-time thing,\" like we all do. Now that it's been a few months, I've had to acknowledge that this is a genuine backslide, and I'm working on reaching out to family and a therapist for help getting back on track. I'm still currently a healthy weight but my purging has gotten out of control, and I know I need help. The problem is, I don't want to tell my SO. He's been nothing but supportive, and I don't think he'd be angry or anything like that, but he's been so happy with the progress I made and I know it would make him sad and worried that I'm struggling again. I have a support network outside of him (family and a few close friends), so I could work through this without him, and part of me wants to deal with it on my own and not worry him. However, we have a strong relationship built on trust, and I'm wondering if this would be lying by omission. For those who have struggled with an ED while in a healthy relationship, do you think it's okay to deal with this backslide alone, or do I need to tell him out of respect for our relationship?", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

When I was in high school and single I didn\u2019t have to worry about people calling me out for not eating bc I was alone all the time. I was still super fat (still above 200 ugh) but no one would yell at me to eat or to have a meal at every mealtime. If anything I kept getting compliments about how good I looked since losing so much weight! It felt awesome, and I eventually got down to 170 my freshman year of college. \n\nNow that I\u2019m in a long term relationship, I am constantly being forced to eat meals. And because I don\u2019t want to and it makes me feel bad and throws me into depression, I end up binging even more. I\u2019ve gained LITERALLY SIXTY EIGHT POUNDS in the relationship. \n\nBUT HERE\u2019S THE THING!!! A few months ago, my boyfriend and I had a huge fight and during the calm-down discussion he confessed that he thought I was getting too big. He has since said he regrets saying it, but I can\u2019t get over the hypocrisy of it all! HE KEEPS DEMANDING I EAT LIKE A FAT PIG BUT DOESNT WANT TO FUCK ME BECAUSE IM GETTING TOO FAT??!!! It\u2019s so frustrating and my weight has been going up and up because he demands that I eat with him all the time (he isn\u2019t overweight, he\u2019s very healthy and in good shape) but my weight goes up and up and up and UP AND UP!! I bet that if I stood on a scale I would be 270-280 right now. I have no idea how to stop eating and binging and just freaking the fuck out every time I consume anything. \n\nMy dilemma is that I genuinely love this guy, and he genuinely loves me, but I\u2019m spiraling and getting huge and he guilt trips me any time I try to diet. I\u2019m so frustrated but leaving the relationship is not an option because he is the man of my dreams and he treats me so well otherwise. And I know him wanting me to eat is out of love and kindness, but he doesn\u2019t understand that my body can\u2019t eat regular foods because it will just store all of it. \n\nI understand my binging is on me, but I also don\u2019t realize what I\u2019m doing until I\u2019m already done and then I want to throw it up but I can\u2019t because that will just cause more trouble than it\u2019s worth.

As a quick introduction hi, skipintorabbitholes here, I've been diagnosed with this godawful mental illness for nearly two decades in ~3 years from now. Last summer I nearly went into cardiac arrest from this, eventually several times. I wasn't allowed to walk for longer than X minutes if I could even do it nonetheless exercise. It might have triggered what was childhood epilepsy back into action so I'm not able to have a driver's license. So I took a break from Reddit.\n\nI had a panic attack last night while programming on the couch so a lovely *We Have No Idea What This Is And It's Really Confused Our Friends For Years Now* (from now on I'll just say WHNIWTI) was helping me calm down. Eventually I did but then they were really concerned and asked if I lost weight?\n\nOf course this foolish brain of mine has: A.) No way to visually assess physical changes; B.) Deceived myself of accountability; C.) Thought I was maintaining weight thanks to this disorder warping my perception of reality and rationality.\n\nI also haven't had [food, bathroom] scales since last June/July. And at one point to everyone's delight but mine I gained weight thanks to friends stuffing me with food. I've spent countless hours dreaming of scales, thinking of visiting a gym or even hiding scales in our apartment, all in the quest to have a number since it's my primary coping mechanism (been working on this). Except I can't and won't do that because I don't want to violate WHNIWTI's trust. Ultimately this has worked well as I'd otherwise be weighing myself every other minute if I could to soothe myself.\n\nAnyways.\n\nI guess the weight loss was really noticable when I curled up into a ball with WHNIWTI patting my back/shoulders leading to checking my arms and legs. And we had a discussion of WHNIWTI asking me how much I currently weigh; I, of course, legitimately not knowing; both of us realising this is (actually!) true; having a discussion on the we don't have a scale in the apartment and my scales ban; talking about the consequences of when I do have access to scales weighing myself nonstop; coming to a mutual conclusion for the night that I'm better without a scale.\n\nI'm miserable stuck in this Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat ED edition. It's bittersweet that I can't get the satisfaction I desire of having access to my numbers and being happy about them; I know this is my brain being hopelessly optimistic and lying that any number will ever be enough to make me happy.\n\nIf someone wanted an answer as to what it was like for Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat inside the box albeit the ED edition this is it. 0/10, do not recommend.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

In layman\u2019s terms what I wanna know is if you can die from eating too much in one sitting and if so how much food can you eat before you kick the bucket.  If I\u2019m being honest I think I\u2019ve been very close to that point (kinda am atm, just binged). Just to clarify Ik that frequently overeating, especially junk food, can cause health problems like diabetes, high colesterol or hypertension which can kill you but what I\u2019m asking here is, imagine you were a healthy person, how much food would you have to eat in one sitting in order for you to die and how exactly would you die? I wonder if it\u2019s merely a question of volume, at some point your stomach can\u2019t fit anything else inside it and it ruptures which I imagine would be fatal. Or if calories should be taken into account as well, for instance would it be as fatal to consume a large amount of water (which has no calories) as it\u2019d be to consume the same amount of Pb (which is very caloric dense)? \n\nAs for my second question you don\u2019t have to answer if it\u2019s too personal or if it triggers you, but it\u2019d be kinda helpful to me if you did. I feel kinda alone as I\u2019m the only person Ik struggling with BED and it\u2019d be nice to hear bout other people\u2019s experience with the disease. Anyway I\u2019ll go first my worst binge was some weeks ago after I went some days restricting and when I was pre stressed out with school.

Dont worry though, I didnt have to recover cause I lied and she believed me, or maybe she didnt but she wanted to and that's enough for all of us. \n\nMaybe she denied all the times she called me fat, made fun of me for my weight, screamed at me for being hungry, threw food at me while yelling at me while I cried in bed because I apparently ruined her night by telling her I was hungry even though I JUST ATE four hours ago, told me I was going to die of diabetes and have to get needles pricked inside of me every day 'if I didnt eat better' a few dozen times, but denying it and having it be enough for her doesnt make it enough for the both of us this time. Plus, hey, I really was fat back then, now I'm not. Now I'm just dying instead. But at least I'm not embarrassing to be seen with now right?\n\nShe would always go into these health kicks where she would only buy 'healthy' stuff no kid would really wanna eat then she would buy a package of chips or cookies and I would end up eating more than I should but looking back at it now that was just cause I felt like I 'had to' since I knew it might not be there the next day. She would always hide it or finish it herself or just throw it away when she went real crazy so I was forced into the mindset of a stupid starving dog, I had to eat it all THEN AND NOW or else what if someone takes it?? When will I get more??\n\nFucking hell no wonder I ended up bulimic. \n\nMaybe I can sleep now. I hope so.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I was told, about a year ago, by my girlfriend at the time  (who struggled with anorexia for some time) that I do have some type of eating disorder, but I can't remember the term she used. Anyway, I'm 28 years old, 5'6, and I fluctuate between 115-135 lbs, which has been my average weight for nearly 16 years. I used to eat a lot, I'm talking 3 meals and like 3 or 4 snacks between each meal. I'm very active and have a decent metabolism so this never caused me to gain excess weight. \n\nThe past few years have been pretty rough though and now I have to focus myself and put time aside just to eat at least one thing in a day. What prompted me to start searching for answers/help is that yesterday, just another normal day, I got up in the morning, went to work, and didn't eat all day. I work from 7am-7pm, and after around 5pm I'm the only one in the building. So yesterday around 6pm, I started to get really light-headed and nauseous, cold sweats, all that. I drink plenty of water, maybe too much lol, so I know I wasn't dehydrated. Took all that I had to remain coherent and conscious while helping the last few customers, with my hands shaking the whole time. After work, I immediately went next door to the gas station, got 2 hot dogs, and about 20 minutes after eating, I started feeling better.\n\n This has happened before, more times than I'd like to admit, but yesterday got me thinking, what if I went unconscious at work when I'm by myself? Nobody would be around to help me and idk what would happen. So that's the story that started me on this path. Now to my actual mentality and feelings about what's happening.\n\nSo I'll put this forth immediately, I don't refrain from eating because of anything to do with weight, calories, or body image. I don't even purposefully refrain from eating at all. I don't like to eat. It is a hassle for me, I don't enjoy it most of the time, I just do it to not die. I had 23 teeth removed in one sitting because they were all pretty much rotting out of my head. I now have a full set of false teeth which enables me to eat even more than I could with my jacked up teeth. But it adds a whole different chore whenever I eat. It has made eating anything more of a task than an enjoyable, natural experience.\n\nSo I guess I'm just wondering if this maybe is some type of disorder? I just feel like I need some direction because, as I said, I'm not fasting intentionally, I'd just rather not eat unless I have to because I don't like to. Any thoughts would be helpful and appreciated. I know there are far more serious and emergent cases than mine, but I hope one of you reading this can find the time to direct me to some literature or general knowledge on the topic. Thanks in advance, and best wishes to all those of you fighting to recover.", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

When I\u2019m really sad (not toooooo often but often enough) I will also just not care at all and just gorge myself on things that taste good since it tastes/feels good and I feel so bad otherwise.     \n\n\n\nI also have ARFID (adult restrictive food intake disorder) so my diet is made worse because I\u2019m so picky and only eat certain things. I was anorexic in the extreme as a teen and into my early 20s. That went away in my 30\u2019s after my cll diagnosis. Spleen pain is one of the symptoms from my cll as well as potassium deficiency due to kidney damage from my chemo. I have to eat regularly or my spleen pain flares up and I have to eat to take and assimilate the potassium supplement I have to take to avoid things caused by low potassium like heart attack. So the usual dysfunctional way I\u2019d alter my diet and lose weight (calorie restriction and not eating) is no longer possible.     \n\n\n\nBut no matter what I do the instances of binging on junk food still happen. I know that boredom frustration and laziness are big contributors. Also feeling hopeless about my physical appearance (I\u2019m fat so what\u2019s the point in caring? These Lil Debbies make me happy and I deserve to feel happy. I did good physically today so I\u2019ll reward myself.) doesn\u2019t help.     \n\n\n\nI have realized that not having the food available within reach is a big help not binging. Got to work on not binging in the middle of the night when I wake up in pain. Noticed that the stuff I take to help me sleep (Benadryl) makes me groggy and more prone to binging when I wake up in the middle of the night as well. Kinda a drunk nom nom nom shove food in my face kinda thing.    \n\n\n\nI guess I\u2019m asking if anyone else is in a similar chronic pain situation that makes exercising supremely difficult and or disabled with the same difficulty. What do you guys say to yourself to stop binging? Any good substitutes for food that\u2019s bad for you? Any successful exercise or weight loss from anyone here who\u2019s disabled or dealing with chronic pain?", "subreddit": "FoodAddiction"}

I was still at a weight I disliked so I started eating less, which turned to \"fasting\", which turned to me eating 1000 calories over the course of a week. I hit my goal weight, decided I still didn't like my body, so I set a lower goal weight, hit it, set another one, etc.yall know how it is. I was never formally diagnosed with anything and I'm not one to self diagnose, but my mom threatened to take me to the doctor for a suspected eating disorder multiple times. I started getting a bit better, stopped obsessing over my weight as much, stopped counting calories for like six months. I unsubcribed from the old sub, hell I didn't even knnow it was banned for a couple months. Things were going okay. But awhile ago things picked back up, except now I hate my body more than I ever have in the past, even when I was at my heaviest weight. I don't starve myself too much anymore, I haven't seriously counted calories in months, but I can *not* stop obsessing over my body. I constantly ask my brothers if I'm fat or skinny, I tell myself I'm gonna not eat and then I walk into the kitchen and eat 10 fun sized bags of peanut m&amp;ms. For someone who really hates their body I'm terrible at losing weight. I don't know, I obsses about my looks all the time, my body literally stops me from going out and doing things with friends, I was invited to a pool party but the thought of swimming around other people, especially people that go to my school is so embarrassing to me. I obsess about my looks and weight, but it's not like I do anything to fix it. I skip meals, yeah, but I don't restrict like I used to. Some days I just don't care about what I eat. I feel like shit when I'm done, and I still think about my body 24/7, but on those days I walk into he kitchen and say \"fuck it, I should be enjoying myself, who gives a shit if I eat an entire row of oreos on my own?\" but at the same time it's also \"I don't deserve to lose weight and be happy so let's eat this entire row of oreos on my own\"", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Avoiding it or ignoring it won\u2019t help!\n\nUse \u201cI\u201d statements.\u00a0Focus on behaviors that you have personally observed, such as \u201cI have noticed that you aren\u2019t eating dinner with us anymore,\u201d or \u201cI am worried about how frequently you are going to the gym.\u201d It\u2019s easy to sound accusatory (\u201cYou\u2019re not eating! You\u2019re exercising too much!\u201d), which can cause a person to feel defensive. Instead, stick to pointing out what you\u2019ve observed. If you can, also point out behaviors not related to eating and weight, which may be easier for the person to see and accept.\u00a0\n\nStick to the facts.\u00a0Raising concerns about a potential eating disorder can bring up lots of emotions, and it\u2019s important not to let those run the show. Instead, talk about behaviors and changes you have observed and calmly point out why you are concerned (\u201cI have seen you run to the bathroom after meals and feel worried you might be making yourself throw up.\u201d).\n\nBe caring, but be firm.\u00a0Caring about your friend does not mean being manipulated by them. Your friend must be responsible for their actions and the consequences of those actions. Avoid making rules, promises, or expectations that you cannot or will not uphold. For example, \u201cI promise not to tell anyone.\u201d Or, \u201cIf you do this one more time, I\u2019ll never talk to you again.\u201d\n\nRemove potential stigma.\u00a0Remind your loved one that there\u2019s no shame in admitting you struggle with an eating disorder or other mental health issue. Many people will be diagnosed with these issues during their lifetimes, and many will recover.\u00a0\n\nAvoid overly simplistic solutions.Being told \u201cJust stop\u201d or \u201cJust eat\u201d isn\u2019t helpful. It can leave the sufferer feeling frustrated, defensive, and misunderstood.\u00a0\n\nBe prepared for negative reactions.Some eating disorder sufferers are glad that someone has noticed they are struggling. Others respond differently. Some may become angry and hostile, insisting that you are the one with the problem. Others may brush off your concerns or minimize potential dangers. Both of these responses are normal. Reiterate your concerns, let them know you care, and leave the conversation open.\n\nEncourage them to seek professional help.\u00a0Many eating disorder sufferers require professional help in order to get better. Offer to help the sufferer find a physician or therapist if they don\u2019t have one, or attend an appointment where the eating disorder is discussed. Getting timely, effective treatment dramatically increases a person\u2019s chances for recovery. If your loved one is ready to seek treatment or you want to explore options, the NEDA Helpline is a great place to start.\u00a0Contact the Helpline &gt;\n\nTell someone.\u00a0It may seem difficult to know when, if at all, to tell someone else about your concerns. Addressing body image or eating problems in their beginning stages offers your friend the best chance for working through these issues and becoming healthy again. Don\u2019t wait until the situation is so severe that your friend\u2019s life is in danger. Your friend needs a great deal of support and understanding.\n\n(Retrieved from www.nationaleatingdisorders.org)", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

For example, \u201cI promise not to tell anyone.\u201d Or, \u201cIf you do this one more time, I\u2019ll never talk to you again.\u201d\n\nRemove potential stigma.\u00a0Remind your loved one that there\u2019s no shame in admitting you struggle with an eating disorder or other mental health issue. Many people will be diagnosed with these issues during their lifetimes, and many will recover.\u00a0\n\nAvoid overly simplistic solutions.Being told \u201cJust stop\u201d or \u201cJust eat\u201d isn\u2019t helpful. It can leave the sufferer feeling frustrated, defensive, and misunderstood.\u00a0\n\nBe prepared for negative reactions.Some eating disorder sufferers are glad that someone has noticed they are struggling. Others respond differently. Some may become angry and hostile, insisting that you are the one with the problem. Others may brush off your concerns or minimize potential dangers. Both of these responses are normal. Reiterate your concerns, let them know you care, and leave the conversation open.\n\nEncourage them to seek professional help.\u00a0Many eating disorder sufferers require professional help in order to get better. Offer to help the sufferer find a physician or therapist if they don\u2019t have one, or attend an appointment where the eating disorder is discussed. Getting timely, effective treatment dramatically increases a person\u2019s chances for recovery. If your loved one is ready to seek treatment or you want to explore options, the NEDA Helpline is a great place to start.\u00a0Contact the Helpline &gt;\n\nTell someone.\u00a0It may seem difficult to know when, if at all, to tell someone else about your concerns. Addressing body image or eating problems in their beginning stages offers your friend the best chance for working through these issues and becoming healthy again. Don\u2019t wait until the situation is so severe that your friend\u2019s life is in danger. Your friend needs a great deal of support and understanding.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t feel the discussion was well-received or that you got through to your loved one, don\u2019t despair. You shared your concern and let them know that you care and you are there for them. You may also have planted a seed that they should seek help. The seed may not take root immediately, but over time, the concern of friends and family can help move an individual towards recovery.\n\n\n(Posted because of some concerns I had about a family member, and not being sure how to go about talking to them at first.

I was never obese but was very overweight. At 12 I wanted to change and lose weight and I did healthily but then WHOOPS I got addicted to losing weight and obsessed about every aspect of food. Developed bulimia at 13 and got very thin but not deathly thin. \"Recovered\" at age 15 and felt great then gained like 20 pounds, got depressed, lost a little bit of weight healthily and felt okay for a while. But every now and then my ED will creep back up and I will have periods of times or \"episodes\" as i like to call them, of restriction, binge, and most recently, purging. I'm 17 now.\n\nANY WHO that was long, sorry. I've been full force restricting and controlling my food like crazy and I love doing it bc yea, control, and I've lost a couple pounds but I was bloated AF this morning and it messed with my head big time and every time I feel fat I get very very discouraged and my emotional eating instincts (from when I was a kid with BED) kick in and I binge HARD. So thats what I did today I ate like 1500+ calories in 2 sitting in like 5 mins each. FUCK. I cried and went nuts and promised myself I wouldn't purge bc I hate purging so bad I hate bulimia but I just couldn't stop myself it's like someone takes over my body. But nothing would come up, even though I had JUST eaten. Idk, but I'm kind of okay with that I didn't wanna purge in the first place but my Ed was forcing me to do it, so take that ED go suck a dick. I just wish I were normal. This is the worst episode I've had in years. But since I'm losing weight it just fuels my obsession even more so I want to keep going. I just want to stop binging so I don't purge I HATE purging I don't want to get addicted to binging and purging again like when I was younger. So hopefully I just stick to my restrictions and stop getting discouraged from fricking BLOATING. At least all this food in my body will kick start my digestive system lmao and I'll take a shit and maybe get rid of the bloating. FML", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

For a while, around when I first moved back in, I was doing pretty well with maintaining a fairly normal diet despite the constant supply of bad food that my parents keep in the house. In recent months, however, it's gotten extremely difficult to avoid my desire to eat everything. I'm feeling incredibly frustrated, defeated, and sad because one of the most common pieces of advice that I see is to \"stop keeping junk food in the house.\" This is actually a really helpful thing for me to do, and when I lived in a dorm by myself I was pretty good about this, but it's absolutely not possible at this point in my life. My parents won't change; I've already tried talking to them. \n\nA big part of my poor relationship with food has to do with my ADHD, which I recently realized I had after some extensive digging online and reflecting on my own symptoms and personal history. I know getting this dealt with and treated properly will probably help a lot, but other factors such as health and financial problems have prevented me from doing so. My goal this week is to at least schedule an appointment with a free therapist at my university, which might help get me back on track with some of the self-care basics that I've let slip. But basically, having untreated ADHD means that I have very little impulse control and that I'm constantly scrounging for little hits of dopamine to keep me stimulated (which is where binge eating comes in) .\n\nI'm not sure where I'm going with this post exactly. I guess I'm just hoping someone will tell me that they've managed to control their eating despite living with people who don't make it easy for them.

I dropped myself to close to 140 lbs and people suddenly started to notice change. Everyone appreciated how I looked, I felt awesome and was happy to see myself confident than before.\n\nBut I was still trying to lose some face fat and thought that it might be better to lose a few more pounds. I was trying but wasn't seeing any difference. Little did I know that I am wiring this wrong habit in my brain. I used to overeat whenever I got free food but ate mostly clean at home. The quantity was little was good enough.\n\nI went home later that year and got access to all the nice food. I ate quite a bit there and overworked my body to get rid of all that as soon as I returned. This is when I messed up by brain even more. I remember my first day of binge when I desperately ate a lot of food while wondering why I was doing that.\n\nThings became worse from then. I got trapped into the binge-purge standard cycle. I might have harmed myself countless times during this. I lost my love with food totally, missed lot of times when my friends invited me out (since I felt guilty after binging). I didn't fell sick any time though (don't know how that happened though). I started binging on liquids. After some research I found out about BED. It took me a year to accept that I have BED.\n\nNow that I have accepted it, I look for ways to get rid of it. I started reading the popular book, Brain over binge and read lot of articles about it. I weigh around 155 pounds now, so I am in mid way from my original progress, but thats because I purged crazily. I feel really unhappy and insecure about my weight. The main reason is my chubby face, I am not much concerned about other fats.\n\nI don't want to look back at this years thinking that I wasted it all for this nonsense. Its probably a long way to go for recovery but I hope that I can truly make it. I don't know if I will ever love food again and given that it is a huge part of everyone's lives, I feel bad for myself to be in this phase.\n\nThis community is awesome and I feel cheered up whenever I see a progress post. Books like atomic habits and the subtle art of giving a fuck makes me feel that all the books have the same message where Brain over binge provides specialized actionable items wrt BED. Habits are powerful and it can beat the shit out of you if done in wrong direction. It is so crazy that I binged even when I had little mobility (due to an accident).\n\nTo be honest, I learned a lot of things along the way. Of course, this is probably not what I wanted to learn in the first place but who cares now. I put myself in this and now will have to get out of this by myself.\n\nThis is a long post and I just wanted a place to vent this out. Reddit is the perfect destination. Hope you all understand. To all the anonymous people out there, I hope that there is light at the end of tunnel.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I have been seeing a nutritionist who has been wonderful with helping me learn my hunger ques and understanding that its okay to eat food. I can even eat food that I like!\n\nLately progress feels so unobtainable. I failed a military physical fitness test because my waist measurement was too large. This standard alone causes me so much anxiety and stress. I don't feel adequate or good enough if I don't meet their standards. I've had some family emergencies happen along with being a shift worker and having to switch every two weeks between a day shift and a night shift due to low manning.\n\nToday I asked my boyfriend to pick up some pants and polo for a ride along I'm doing with a local flight medic company tomorrow. I knew my size. When I saw them I just felt my heart drop... I don't feel as big as those look. It hurts me so much. I feel utterly disgusting. Which makes me just want to clam up and hide away. Put on big baggy clothing and go to sleep so I don't have to deal with the disappointment.\n\nI never in my life thought I would be the size I am today. Needless to day I am on the heavier side of overweight. I don't feel pretty. I don't feel worthy. I dont know how to fix myself.

I skipped breakfast, ran out the door to work and had a busy day so I worked right thru and didn't eat until I got home. I had a medium bowl of popcorn (light butter/salt), then ate a small thin crust cauliflower pizza (the make at home/add your own toppings type of pizza with white sauce, chicken, cheese, olives, and jalapenos). I planned to eat dessert after, then stop eating for the night.... But I restrict, and I was still very hungry. I had restricted heavily for three of the four days prior to this too.\n\nThen I finished off my dad's half pizza (they're small 10\" pizzas), then his girlfriends half too... loaded with way more meat and cheese than I put on mine. And I scarfed them down and I was still hungry...\n\nThen I remembered I had cookies in my bedroom (I knew In shouldn't have brought those damn things home...) I then proceeded to eat 5 jumbo sized rainbow chip cookies from safeway (300 calories each), and followed that up with ~20-25 pieces of fun size candies (Snickers, 100 Grand, Milky Way, etc.) Quickly added another 2,000 calories there.\n\nSo I'm in the ballpark of about 6-6,500 calories with a bowl of popcorn, two pizzas, 5 jumbo cookies, and 25 pieces of candy.\n\nFelt gross.

Like many others with bulimia, I spent most of that time gaining and losing the same 15 pounds over and over. I've been in recovery for about 6 months now. It definitely hasn't been perfect, but it's been getting better, and my binges/purges are spaced further and further apart and get less intense each time. I'm even steadily losing weight and maintaining, rather than gaining back a ton of weight, and I'm currently at a slightly lower weight than I was before bulimia, with more muscle from the lifting, and not as food obsessed as I used to be. I've been taking Vyvanse, but using it as a tool to normalize my eating, rather than using it to restrict forever until it wears off and I end up binging anyways. These are the general guidelines I've been using for myself:\n\n1. On training days, I\u2019ll eat at LEAST twice a day: before and after my workout\n\n2. Other calories aside, I will always get at the bare minimum amount of protein (my weight in pounds in grams of protein) per day, whether I\u2019m training or not\n\n3. If I overeat or binge, I\u2019m not going to compensate for it through exercise, aside from potentially doing more reps in a plus set at the gym that I would have done anyways even if the binge didn\u2019t occur. This includes adding cardio I wouldn\u2019t have done otherwise, trying to increase NEAT, trying to max out when I\u2019m not scheduled to, or doing sets or workouts I wouldn\u2019t have done on my program/routine. \n\n4. In that same vein, I\u2019m not going to compensate for binges or overeating through purging. \n\n5. If I do overeat or binge, I\u2019m still going to eat until I reach the minimum amount of protein, as well as the recommended 25 grams of fiber \n\n6. If I do overeat or binge, I\u2019m not going to fast or restrict the next few days to make up for it\n\n7. If I really want something, I\u2019m just going to fucking eat it. One dessert from that restaurant I\u2019m finally trying after a year of wanting to go is totally worth it. And honestly, so is that store bought sheet cake that was brought in for a labmate\u2019s birthday. Just enjoy it and move on. \n\n8. If I\u2019m still genuinely hungry after a meal, I can keep eating. Staying cold, tired, unenergized, unable to concentrate, stressed, and angry all the time just makes everything ten times worse and if an extra 500 calories fixes that who the fuck cares if I gain an extra five pounds\n\n9. No cheat days. Eat what I want anytime if I really want something. It\u2019s never a cheat day. It\u2019s building sustainable habits.\n\n10. If I feel like my body is working against me during a workout, even if I\u2019ve overeaten or binged and have extra energy, if I can tell I\u2019m tired/losing focus/breaking form/etc., I\u2019m not going to force myself to keep training. It\u2019s not worth getting injured for two more sets of deadlifts. Just stop. \n\n11. No intentional or planned chewing+spitting. This is still disordered, isn\u2019t going to help my relationship with food, and will likely cause more problems (teeth, insulin, digestive enzyme overload).\n\nImportant to note, I don't give myself any calorie restrictions or minimums. Just a macronutrient minimum, which I follow pretty loosely. My abs are starting to show, and I don't feel constantly hungry, food obsessed, cold, or exhausted all the time, and I've woken up to a lighter weight almost every week for the past two months. I do still track my food, but in a general calorie and macronutrient range, rather than weighing everything to the gram. I typically eat anywhere between 1500 - 4000 calories a day. I'm posting this because I know how much it fucking sucks to deal with an eating disorder while trying to lose weight and improve physique, and I'm hoping I can be a resource to anyone who may find this info helpful.

She said (copied and pasted from our messages), \"Man that was intense. I wish I could have understood your struggle at the time. I knew you were thin but I didn\u2019t realise that you couldn't help your battle.\"\n\nIn my early twenties now, I am in a state of I would say 95% recovery, but as discussed in this video, it is okay to feel like wanting to go back to your old ED habits because you yearn for the times when adult responsibilities weren't looming, when you were just left alone because no one expected anything of you because you were so sick. I am relieved to know that this is common, to want to go back and feel like you're in the thick of the fun of the \"secret\" life you're living. Knowing that the control aspect of the addiction is what is alluring, not the sickness itself.\n\nAs discussed in the video, it can be little things like certain sounds and scents which bring you back to that time in your life, but I think I know now that it's okay to acknowledge these sensory triggers, and think about my progress rather than letting it drag me back under. \n\nPlease give this a watch, it really has motivated me knowing I am not a horrible, twisted individual who can't let go of the past, and that there are other people like me who are mostly happy but when things get overwhelming, the ED calls me back and has me zone out for a little while, even if not for long.

I decided to go to all 4 of their California shows. It started with high restricting because I wanted to lose some weight for the shows.

It has been my comfort and my shame throughout my adult life. Warning: This is a long post, going into some detail about my life. Tl;dr is at the bottom.\n\nAs a kid I didn't grow up in a great household. I lived with my single mother and two siblings in a very strict household. Homeschooled, catholic to the extreme end of the spectrum, and a mother who didn't truly see her kids as individual people, but rather \"extensions of herself\" as my old therapist used to say...classic narcissism. Food was kept as a treat. Things like snack foods, soda, ice cream and the like were \"adult treats\" or \"not for kids\". I think that is one of the factors that led me to where I am today. Anyway, I was misearable there. There was daily abuse that I won't go into detail about, kept in the confines of my home while in public we were the perfect family. \n\nWhen I finally moved out, (or rather, was rescued at 16 by my father) I was in heaven basically. I was in charge of what I ate and what I did every day! I saw a therapist for a couple years to help me with my now diagnosed anxiety disorder and personality disorder, leftover lifetime gifts given to me by my mother. I completed my final two years of high school in public school, and found myself.  That feeling of freedom got stronger when I went off to college and became truly in charge of myself. I avoided healthy stuff and became almost addicted to foods, especially macaroni and cheese...my personal favorite.\n\nHowever, it wasn't pure joy I felt after the first couple years. The feeling of freedom became overrun with an inability to stop myself. When I hit 20 I started trying dieting, gym memberships, etc, but that motivation would only last a couple months at best before I'd give in again and binge food even after I didn't think I could take another bite. There are literally times where I feel absolutely stuffed, but I look at the food in front of me and find myself snacking on it again. \n\nLast year I managed to keep with the dieting and gym for almost a full year, thanks to the wonderful motivation my sister (who's escape from our mother's house is an entirely different story) who would go with me to every workout, and encourage me through it all. In total, I lost about 60 pounds and I was thrilled. I thought I had finally beaten it.\n\nBut then I moved. My long time boyfriend and I decided it was time to move in together and so I packed up and moved across a couple states, away from my friends, my father and sisters, from my motivation. Moving was no big deal for me, I had done it before. I moved for college, I moved for adventure, I moved for rebellions sake and explored my freedom before returning to my home state and being with my family. But for some reason this move effected me differently.\n\nI love my boyfriend. I truly do. I see us spending the rest of our lives together. So before you get any ideas that I am blaming him, I most certainly am not. I made all my own choices that led me to where I am, and I am happy with him. Just not happy with myself.\n\nMoving away this time turned me into someone else. I became almost hermit like. I never leave the house unless I'm going to work or unelss my boyfriend takes me somewhere. I've been here an entire year and have yet to make a single friend. People at work know me as standoffish. Good at her job but not one to make casual conversation. I gave up the gym. I went right back to eating. I gained back almost every pound of that 60 I lost and I hate myself. My reflection repulses me, makes me feel physically ill to look at. You'd think my own reflection would be motivation enough to get back to it but I literally can't stop. All I think about it food. I snack even without noticing what I am doing. \n\nI don't know how to do it anymore. I don't know how to stop. I know its an issue, its not just my self esteem, I look truly disgusting and huge. I'm honestly surprised my boyfriend even still likes me but he really does everything he can to make me feel okay about myself. It just doesn't work. I hide food, I go get fast food when I know he is sleeping so he doesn't see me gorge myself. I order food only when he is at work and literally bury the evidence in the bottom of the trash can. \n\nNot only can I not afford a therapist that I am pretty sure I need, but I am also scared to see one.  I need advice and help before I become even bigger and it really sucks to recognize that and not feel like I can control myself. The guilt I feel every time I eat anything it overpowering, but never as strong as the urge to make something else to eat. Maybe I'm just lazy, but I don't know what to do about it anymore. \n\nTL;DR: I eat uncontrollably, to the point where I hide my food and evidence I had as much as I do from my boyfriend. I can't afford a therapist and hate myself. I recognize that I overeat and still continue to do so. My own huge reflection doesn't seem to motivate me to stop and I need advice.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

WHY did I do that? I still had to purge the lunch we just ate. \n\nAfter my brother and I got back to my place, we ate some popcorn and watched Parks &amp; Rec. I noticed how into the show he was getting. He had never watched it and thought it was hilarious. His eyes were GLUED to the TV. \n\nI kept eating, making more things to eat as well and sharing with him. He stopped and said he was full, and his eyes were still glued to the TV. I told him it was time for him to take a shower and get ready for bed. \n\n*I swore to myself I wasn\u2019t going to purge.* \n\nWhile he showered, I binged more. I noticed how loud the water was (that\u2019s handy because it\u2019s a studio apartment so normally you\u2019d hear everything).

My whole life, I've been either focused on losing weight, feeling fat, or obsessing about what food I eat next, or what food I shouldn't/should be eating, etc. As in, the central core of my whole life has either been about weight or food. At my heaviest, I used to be 260 pounds and a size 20. I worked hard and leveled out at about 190 and a size 12. That weight became my normal for 3+ years, and I felt... Alright about it. But, there were still \"problem areas\"; cellulite, muffin top, plus every obesity chart ever telling me I was still, in fact, \"obese\". (As a 5'6 female, \"obesity\" technically stops at 185, when you fall into the \"overweight\" category). So, everything told me I still needed to lose weight, in spite of me being active and my cholesterol, blood pressure, and all other vitals being totally well within normal range. \n\nSo, I began 3+ years of severe diet restriction in which I'd lost 10ish pounds, then go straight back to bingeing and gain it all back. Up and down it went, back and forth it swung. Recently, I did a bootcamp weight loss challenge and lost almost 30. I was into the 160s and feeling fab, because that had been my goal all along, just to hit that even \"100 pounds lost\". And guess what? I maintained that weight for all of a month until I started bingeing yet again, and here I sit back at freaking 190. \n\nI'm a mess right now because... well, I've seen therapists for this stuff, I've read every self help book there is. Today I just started reading a book called The F*ck It Diet, and it basically says that you can never be cured of BED until you decide to stop dieting altogether, because a diet still means you're obsessing over food, and forcing your body into starvation mode makes it yearn for food, etc etc. But that would mean I'd be stuck at 190 forever. I mean, is this just my \"normal\"? Should I learn to just be happy at my size even though every fiber of everything I've ever been taught or seen in society tells me I need to be thinner? The thought of stepping on my scale fills me with anxiety; the thought of throwing out my scale fills me with even more anxiety, because I'm so afraid of waking up and being 260 again. All I know is, I feel miserable right now, all I'm thinking about is whether I should be eating or not, and I don't know how to snap out of it. I'm 33 years old, and I've still never managed to \"snap out of it\".\n\nI just feel so incredibly lost right now :(", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

And sure enough, he goes to the bathroom every time he goes down and eats his snack. Then, he lies to my parents about eating meals when he didn't. He almost never eats lunch and only eats a little breakfast. He seems really down all the time now, and hates socializing with anyone.

I needed a refill on a drink and I asked my friend to go with me (I am at a crowded house party where I barely know anyone, I want to be safe) and she was coming to join me across the room so I started walking. I get to the bar and turn around and realize Bob had followed me the whole time and when he noticed my friend he disappeared.\n\nThe host of the party offered me his vape and I said no, bc I don't smoke and he said it's all good.

I know BMIs are supposed to be bullshit but mine says I am not at a healthy weight for my size and honestly I don\u2019t look like I am either. All I want to do is lose weight in a healthy way and no one will help me do it. I hate how I look and I want to be fit again the way I was before I started starving myself. I\u2019ve talked to my therapist and honestly she\u2019s pretty shit with dealing with my eating disorder issues. I was directed to a nutritionist who tells me I\u2019m eating perfectly healthy if not enough food. I\u2019m also afraid I\u2019m not doing enough working out to tone up on muscle but I work out 3 times a week and she said anything more would be too much. But even after forcing myself to eat more than I want to for months I am still gaining weight. I can\u2019t fit into any of my clothes anymore. All I want to do is lose weight in a healthy way and all anyone ever tells me is that I shouldn\u2019t be focusing on my weight and instead try loving the body I have. I can\u2019t love the body I have when it keeps getting bigger and bigger and I feel worse and worse for a multitude of reasons including the financial strain of having to buy new clothes as well as the fact that part of my worth does actually depend heavily on my appearance in my career of choice.

I'm about 400 lbs and going to a treatment center that treats all types of eating disorders, meaning a lot of the other people will be anorexic and I'm going to be the fattest one, which gives me so much anxiety. I mean I'm the fattest one everywhere now, but I feel like they'll all judge me so much harsher there. I don't know. Last time, the people were super nice and friendly but I can't help but thinking they're talking behind my back.

I would binge occasionally and then try to purge- nothing would come up. Then, I'd cry because I felt like I just couldn't do anything right. \n\nThen one day I was able to purge. I felt powerful, it felt like an accomplishment- I was some sort of *proud* of my newfound ability. I thought for sure I had control over it. I'd continue my life and if I went on an occasional binge, I would be able to compensate.\n\n Look, I've always had a fair amount of self discipline and I'd consider myself an intelligent person. I have never really had a problem with any sort of addiction before. I thought for sure I could control this. \n\nBut I severely underestimated the power of an ED. I've developed bulimia at the age of 26- a good 10 years older than when most people start. \n\nIt started with about once a month, moved to once a week, and now it's almost every damn day.\n\nI've gotten better at purging, I can incorporate more foods into my binges with ease. It's become a daily habit now. Because I know I can get rid of my binge food, I don't have the same immediate consequence of weight gain. It's so much easier to justify a binge because I know I can just throw it up.\n\n My physical health is suffering, my bank account is dwindling, I'm becoming even more dissociated with myself, I feel so guilty for all the waste I'm making. I feel like I've just lost control of my life. \n\n\nPlease, please do your best to avoid going down this road. Purging only delays the consequences of a binge. Someone posted recently \"you can always lose fat, but you can't regrow your teeth\". There are other things purging can do that causes permanent damage to your body.  \n\nI know how incredibly frustrating it is to not be able to purge. I know you feel like a failure, maybe like your ED is invalidated. Your ED is every bit as valid as mine or anyone else's. It is never too early to admit there is a problem and start working on it.

I had given everything I had to get to the point that I was at; I had suffered so much. If I gave it all up, then what was the point of it all?\n\nEventually, the time came to where my nutritionist and my therapist called for a joint session to find out what to do about my continuing restriction in treatment. I danced around what I really wanted to say until my emotions boiled over, and I started crying while saying what I wanted to. The air in the room was tense for a moment, almost cold. My nutritionist broke the silence, and told me she's never heard someone say that before; that the fact I could say and believe it was the saddest thing she'd heard in that facility.\n\nWe quickly moved past that into the usual talk we had in our sessions. *Try to identify what makes you feel that way. Your body's functions are improving. Your heart is still weak. Show yourself some self love, you deserve it. We want to see you succeed.* I won't say that words like that aren't encouraging, because they most certainly are. However, my question was never touched upon again, in any of our sessions, nor in partial, when I stepped down.\n\nI don't quite believe in that lie anymore, but it still sticks around in my head.

But it\u2019s like that, now that I\u2019m away, if I plunge into these habits it (1) won\u2019t get noticed because they don\u2019t know how I regularly eat/act, and (2) if anything does happen it won\u2019t affect me long term because I\u2019m going back home in a few weeks.\n\nI just started restricting when I got here, about 700 cals a day, and just... kept going with it. I didn\u2019t think a whole lot of it, I just did it and thought \u2018by the end of this I\u2019ll have just lost a handful of pounds and I\u2019ll go back to life as normal\u2019 because I\u2019ve sort of done that before. I\u2019ve had mini lapses and gone back to things as normal when it became really necessary. \n\nBut I had a phone call with my brother today, and it got me feeling all guilty (my brother really worries about my ED), so I decided the next meal I would start eating normally...\n\nAnd, of course, I couldn\u2019t do it. I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to. I got all anxious and worried, and there was a line, and I just decided to get a plate of vegetables and called it a day. I finally forced myself to eat more at dinner, and about an hour later I was on the verge of full-on panic attack I was so freaked.\n\nSo I\u2019m stuck here. Hello. I\u2019m back.\n\nAnyone do this when they\u2019re away from home/supervision of people that know them? Because I become practically out of control in these situations. I\u2019ve yet to be traveling and not relapsing simultaneously. (And after this I\u2019m leaving for two and a half months to North Carolina for another music intensive. Help.)\n\n(TL;DR - I always, always relapse when I\u2019m traveling/away from home. I\u2019m currently away from home and have found myself suddenly in the pit of relapse. Please tell me I\u2019m not the only one.)", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I recently posted about waking up in the middle of the night and someone suggested looking into medical issues. Apparently one of the possible reasons is restless leg syndrome. I don\u2019t know if I have that, but I know that I can\u2019t sit for extended periods of time without bouncing my leg, fidgeting, tapping my fingers, or something. \n\nI also know that Vyvanse, something used for BED, is an ADHD medication.\n\nThat, and the fact that I know my binges are driven by compulsions/urges rather than anything else (I binge even if I\u2019m not hungry or haven\u2019t restricted calories, and I don\u2019t and never have eaten to manage emotions even back when I was \u201ceating normally\u201d - it\u2019s literally just compulsion and habit), made me look into the symptoms of adult ADHD and... Wow, a lot of them fit. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression when I was 12 so I figured a lot of what I was experiencing now was that exacerbated by the binging (biopsychosocial model of health, hurrah), but adult ADHD seems scary accurate. For the past few months - around the time my binging started - I\u2019ve been feeling like my brain is \u201cbroken\u201d. I can\u2019t focus, to the point that I can\u2019t read a few-page long short story or even a paragraph of a book. I repeatedly space out during class and even during conversations - someone will be giving me instructions and by the time they finish talking I\u2019ll have no clue what they said in the slightest. Poor impulse control - including, of course, compulsive eating. Interrupting people, talking way more than usual for someone who\u2019s anxious about how others perceive them, entering conversations I\u2019m not a part of. Can\u2019t watch movies or TV without doing at least one or two other things at the same time, and definitely can\u2019t sit down for the length of a movie without feeling inexplicably, absurdly uncomfortable from being still for so long.\n\nI\u2019m thinking of seeing a psychiatrist once I\u2019m back home (I\u2019m currently studying abroad). My only thing is, if it is ADHD, why is it presenting now so suddenly and intensely? \n\nDoes anyone have experience with this?

My food hoarding has gotten extreme again and I feel like my skull will be smashed in by a falling can of black beans so I want to spend time today organizing my life instead of going to the gym. \n\nI\u2019ve suffered from an eating disorder since I was a young child and it\u2019s gotten bad again recently. I\u2019ve tried so many times to recover. I\u2019ve tried so hard to be the type of person I could love. I just want to see in myself what everyone else sees in me. \n\nI\u2019m so tired from having to disguise it as a diet. I\u2019m becoming physically ill from it again. My hair is falling out and I love my hair. I slather myself in lotion and chapstick- but I\u2019m still dry. No matter how much water I drink, it doesn\u2019t help my skin. I need help. It\u2019s so painful to work so hard to improve my life, my relationships and my health only to have the obsessions run it into the fuckin ground.  \n\nIt\u2019s hard to hold onto what I care about. \n\n I have so much going for me but I still manage to ruin it for myself. \n\nNo matter how happy everyone thinks I am- I\u2019m dying inside. Despite my best attempts- I\u2019m ruined again. I am the ultimate example of how we can never know what\u2019s going on with someone else. Everyone who interacts with me at work tells me I\u2019m the most cheery person they\u2019ve ever met. Except why then do I go home and beat my legs, b/p, exercise until I\u2019m sick, weigh 1.3 kcal of lemon juice and starve myself when my brain won\u2019t take any other punishment? If only they knew.....\n\nI\u2019m definitely still holding on but it\u2019s getting harder. I\u2019m having a hard time staying focused. Despite all the support I have in my life I\u2019m struggling. I don\u2019t want to let them down! I can\u2019t watch the dissatisfaction and sadness that comes into their eyes when I\u2019m relapsing. They deserve someone better than me. \n\nA better daughter. A better girlfriend. A better sister. A better best friend. A better leader. \n\nI want to get better! I have all the tools. I have all of the support. I have all of the structure. \n\nExcept I don\u2019t have any power. My demon other self pulls the cords that attach my eyeballs to my brain. She doesn\u2019t let me see what others do. I feel fatter today than I did 35 pounds ago. How much will I lose before I see the difference in the mirror instead of just on the scale? \n\nShe hurts me. I don\u2019t think I love her anymore. My demon doesn\u2019t help me with anything anymore. My anxiety isn\u2019t quelled. I do not have proud moments of reaching goal weight. She used to whisper secret admirations. She used to be proud of me. Now I think she just wants me dead. \n\nI am just tired of her running my life. I\u2019m so afraid I\u2019ll never escape despite all of my effort to recover. All of the treatment hours and the years of loved ones poured into me. It\u2019s because I don\u2019t know anything else. My memories before her are so few. They aren\u2019t safe either so I try to ignore them anyway. She tells me that she is me- that we are the same. I don\u2019t believe her anymore. My true voice is small and frail because she\u2019s been my judge and jailer for multiple decades. \n\nWill I someday be laying on my death bed having suffered from an ED consistently my entire life? What a sorry existence. Crying over carrot sticks. Getting mozzarella chunks stuck in my nose. Binging on ice lemon water. The constant obsession with my belly. The absolute fixation on everyone else\u2019s bodies and how mine compares. The stair master sessions where I climbed myself into heaven. \n\nIs this what I\u2019ll remember when my life flashes before my eyes? \n\nThat sucks. That sucks so bad. \n\nI want to rewind it all. \n\nGo back to eight year old me. \n\nTell her that there\u2019s more to life than self imposed torture for crimes that ARENT EVEN CRIMES. \n\nWhy do I hate myself for eating the last piece of bread at Thanksgiving when I was 11? Why do I hate myself for eating one of my father in law\u2019s bananas then wasting the bunch he bought the next day for me to have all to myself? Why do I cry about all the hundreds of pounds of food I\u2019ve puked that could\u2019ve fed starved children who\u2019ve already died while I\u2019m allowed to pander my life away????? \n\nI miss the life I never had. I\u2019d be so proud of myself if I had never contracted this illness. I imagine I\u2019d be so successful considering how well I\u2019ve managed to scrape up through all the suffering. In an alternate universe without my ED, I see myself shining. Never afraid to be the fantastic woman she can confidently say she is! \n\nInstead, I type this. Sitting in my parking lot. Worried about how I\u2019ll feel after posting this. \n\nI don\u2019t want to die. But I can\u2019t keep living with this eating disorder. I wish I could delete my memory and relearn how to be myself by watching videos of how I act around everyone in my life. I wouldn\u2019t be shown any videos of how I act when I\u2019m alone. \n\nI need a lobotomy with a side of chicken soup.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I walk non stop, binge, attempt to starve (and fail), \"exercise\" during the middle of the night if you can call it that, take all kinds of bullshit pills/lax but just now I've had the ultimate kick in the face to make me realise I am an idiot still. I somehow was able to justify (poorly) the above actions, but now I have no excuse for this:\n\nThere is a work summer party. I didn't want to go as it ruins my routine - I barely interact socially anymore with the people I work with. But these are the bosses who supported me in the past and bought me back and have shown nothing but kindness.\n\nSo I do the normal, I start laying foundations beforehand about not being able to stay long so can make a move early etc. Thinking/praying it would be rubbish anyway, I wouldn't miss much. But here we are:\n\nEveryone is there - the bosses, people from every area of the organisation (I barely know them but was mixing for a while). Free drinks and..... food. But I had to stick to my story about needing to leave despite already staying longer than planned. I was having a decent time, talking with people and feeling marginally normal despite being an awkward mess.\n\nHere I am, on the train back miserable in the realisation that I have let my ED yet again win by ruining something that could have been great. I now feel even more socially isolated at work as I miss out on these memories and stories.\n\nWhat is the actual point of continuing to live if I don't have anybody or anything to live for except serving this bullshit brain of mine.

I\u2019ve been in recovery for enough years that I don\u2019t think of myself as being \u201cin recovery\u201d anymore. \n\nA few years ago I was diagnosed with a chronic illness that so far can be managed with a restrictive medical diet. I worked with a dr and dietitian to go through the elimination diet and reintroduce foods slowly but surely until I could have a somewhat normal life. I still hve a lot of unsafe foods though. \n\nAbout two months ago I either was exposed to something I can\u2019t eat or had a nasty stomach bug, and it landed me in the hospital for a few days. I took even more time recovering outside the hospital, and I was put back on the most restrictive version of my medical diet until I was able to tolerate a normal volume of food again. \n\nUnsurprisingly I developed a ton of food anxiety and general health anxiety, so I went back to therapy for help around the health anxiety. Of note, I don\u2019t think my therapist or dietitian are aware of my ED history. \n\nFrom there my dietitian worked with me to introduce foods to diversify my diet and incorporate more formerly safe foods. It seems tht I had a bad reaction. Like, scary bad almost went back to the hospital and that going off those formerly safe foods and back on the super restrictive diet helped relieve them. \n\nBut my ED thoughts are back and I hve an irrational fear of food and mealtime. I\u2019m afraid of eating all but two foods and even then I\u2019m still anxious around mealtime and hate eating in front of or with others. The feeling of food in my stomach makes me feel sick and gross and worried. I don\u2019t want to eat. I\u2019m eating significantly less than half of what I should be. \n\nI\u2019m perversely enjoying the weight loss and feeling of strength/self-confidence from getting through the day without a proper amount of food. And that\u2019s the ED. The over-restricting of an already restrictive diet is not rational either. The anxiety I get around the physical process of eating is irrational too. Most of my day involves thinking and worrying about food, eating, or not eating. \n\nBUT\n\nI\u2019m not trying to or concerned with losing weight, I\u2019m not concerned about my body image, it\u2019s only kind of related to control (wish I could somehow ensure my health!), so is it really a relapse or even an ED at all?\n\nMy therapist is out of town and I\u2019m really, really overwhelmed so I reached out to a local ED clinic about their IOP program and am waiting to be called back for an assessment. I don\u2019t even know what to expect. When I went for treatment many years ago, it was clearly an ED. Now I\u2019m not so sure but I don\u2019t know where else to go. \n\nWhat is this?

Sometimes she skips meals over the day to 'win some calories'. She also told me she sometimes exhibits urges of extreme hunger and over eats to the point at which she throws up. She sees being fat herself as a really bad thing and worries, that eating even just a little more a day might make her fat all a sudden. I am worried about her, and since we live a few hours apart, we rarely see each other and only occasionally talk to each other. Since I have given her helpful advice before, she sort of trusts in my intentions. I was hoping you guy could help me help her.\n\nHer weekly schedule is rather packed with work, uni and some other stuff.\n\nHer support system is really non existant, she is afraid of getting her family involved (feels guilty for being a priority), thinks some of her friends don't care or aren't close enough.\n\nI've got her to reconsider visiting her therapist again and taking some sessions.\n\nShe has other issues she tries to deal with, is on antidepressants, and thinks she can't handle everything.\n\nHer urge of eating has come before and she is afraid of throwing up and having a burst again. \n\nMy suggestion so far: take it slow. Focus on trying to eat a little bit more over the day and slowly fix the (imo) bad eating habit. Go to therapy and get maybe family involved (slowly have therapists make them familiar and not have them overreact) and look for food that you can eat lots of with low kcal (which she focuses obsessively on). So far at rice and kidney beans.\n\nOn the one hand I'm looking for suggestions, on the other hand I'm looking for critic of my tips to her.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I've been doing pretty OK (I've had ups and downs and have been stuck in the restict-binge cycle for some time, but no major relapses into my anorexia has occured and I've felt pretty okay most of the time) since I was 20, and last year I got a boyfriend. I love him more than anything, we're moving in together very soon and all I want is for him - and for us - to be happy. \n\nHowever, I've recently relapsed quite significantly into my eating disorder as well as suffering from a mild to moderate depression for the last six months or so. This is of course incredibly hard for us both. I've been very open with him about it all and he is super supportive, but I know he is in a lot of pain, that he worries for me, and that he's having a really hard time because of this. His support helps me and I truly appreciate everything he does to be there for me, but at the same time the guilt is smothering me. I often think about how much easier his life would be if we had never got together, and I just wish relapse wasn't a thing.. He says that he would rather have me in his life - with all my baggage - than not have me in his life at all, and that we are going to get through this. Together.\n\nI guess what I'm wondering is: how can I make things as easy for him as possible? With this post I'm really hoping to reach out to the people of this subreddit who have been supporters, loved ones and SO's of people struggling, and to hear what helped you through the process of illness and recovery. I find it really hard to know if it is best for him that I'm completely open and share my feelings/thoughts/struggles with him, or if it's better to keep it to myself and my psychologist (when I get one, that is..)? Can I say or do anything to make him feel better and less concerned? I'm afraid he won't tell me if he's having a hard time because he knows I already have a lot on my plate. I really just want to be the best girlfriend, support and friend that I can be for him in the midst of all of this.

I\u2019ve been in recovery for so many years that I don\u2019t think of myself as \u201cin recovery.\u201d\n\nBUT\n\nI received a diagnosis that so far has only been manageable through a restrictive diet. I work with a dietitian to ensure that I\u2019m eating enough. I\u2019m currently on the border of overweight and health weight. Of note, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever talked about my ED history with my current dietitian.\n\nAbout 6-8 weeks ago I was either exposed to an allergen or some kind of gastro bug so bad that I landed in the hospital for a few days and my recovery took a couple weeks. My dietitian had me back on the most restrictive version of my medical diet until I was able to eat enough volume to begin reintroducing foods.\n\nThe experience through me for a loop and I had a lot of anxiety around eating and I enjoyed the weight loss a little too much and noticed some ED thoughts recurring for the first time in years. I got myself back in therapy which is helping with the general health scare anxiety but not the ED thoughts.\n\nMy dietitian gave me the ok to reintroduce a specific class of foods, and I thought all was going well for a week or so but then I had a huge, awful resurgence of symptoms, felt like I was gonna land back in the hospital, it was awful. To be safe I backed off of the new foods, and the symptoms subsided significantly but not entirely. I\u2019m getting checked out by my doc to make sure everything\u2019s good health wise and so far they think so.\n\nSince then I\u2019ve been terrified to eat. I\u2019m restricting again. I feel out of control and like I have only two \u201csafe\u201d foods. It doesn\u2019t help that a store employee sold me a food item after I had asked about my allergens and said it was fine but then when I went to eat it, it very visibly had the allergens I asked about. I got a refund but the principle of feeling like there are no safe foods or places to eat is getting to me.\n\nI don\u2019t want to eat, I\u2019m eating much less than even half of what I should be, and I feel out of control. Mealtime makes me so anxious. I can\u2019t stand eating around people in case I get sick. But it\u2019s not about body image or control (well maybe a little control), like a lot of my original ED was, so I\u2019m not sure if seeking treatment makes sense, but I\u2019m not sure where else to turn to.\n\nMy therapist keeps saying it takes time, and I trust her but we haven\u2019t gone over my ED history or my thinking about going back to an IOP or something yet. I just feel like I can\u2019t stand the stress of eating anymore, and my therapist is out of town, so I called a local ED place and am waiting to hear back about a phone assessment but I don\u2019t know what to expect or if it was the right call.\n\nIs what I\u2019m going through considered a relapse, or a different ED, or not related?

Yes, I white-knuckled it for the first few days....but then it started to get easier. I felt lighter and more motivated to stay on track.

In 100-plus degree Las Vegas Valley dry heat. Wearing a long black dress. But I wasn't even considering those factors when I left; I thought I'd be fine.\n\nI went pretty far, ending up at a residential street I'd never seen before. At some point I realized I'd be too far from home if I continued and started going back - moments later, something didn't feel right.\n\nMy mouth was totally dried up, constricting my throat. My brain felt like it was shrinking, filling my head with empty space. My whole body felt weak and fragile, hard to control, like I was going to pass out right there on the hot pavement. My heart was pounding wildly, both from the heat stress and the stress of realizing my life was on the line.\n\nFirst attempt to save myself: Waving my arms wildly on the side of the road for help. An older couple pulled over, and I cried that I was going to be dehydrated. The lady gave me some sips of cool thermos water and let me take the ice, telling me to breathe and calm down.\n\nI was thankful, of course, but soon the danger came back. Second attempt to save myself: Going to the drinking fountains at the park on the shorter route home. A kid at the canopy-shaded bench asked me, \"Hey, I've got a question for you... Why are you running in this heat?\" He was vaping, but his voice was prepubescent. I just told him I realized my mistake and was here to get hydrated, and we wished each other a good day. I went off to chug lukewarm water until I felt cooled.\n\nBut the danger was *still* there, and only getting worse. I waved and called for help, but it was weaker this time, and nobody stopped. Over ten minutes left to walk - would I even make it? Third attempt to save myself: showing up at my old pediatrician's office close by.\n\nThe folks at the front desk listened to my explanation. They sure could see what a mess I was. Hot, flushed, high heart rate, high blood pressure. Probably heat exhaustion, they figured; don't do this ever again, they told me.  I realized it had been hours since I left home. I received a Pedialyte freezer pop (5 cal! I didn't know these were a thing!) for electrolytes, an Otter Pop (45 cal) for sugar, and plenty of water. I was getting cooler, but something still felt wrong, and I was still terrified that my body would give out.\n\nMy grandmother came to pick me up. They recommended taking me to the ER and getting me on an IV, but she trusted I'd get better if I just rested at her place. And it was great. I didn't even shirk the Gatorades, nuts, and cheese she offered; I just wanted to feel better.\n\nI'm not totally feeling well yet, but I'm getting there.

Since middle school, I have obsessed over my weight, my figure and my appearance. I have no official ED diagnosis but I have dealt with disorderd eating as a tween.\n\nMy modus operandi is cycles of fasting/low calorie restriction and full on 4k cal binges.

I going home at the end of the month to visit. I casually had mentioned I had lost weight. Completely on purpose. Because I use those positive comments to fuel restriction. I want to get down to 170 (ugw 125) before I go back to NC. I want to be smaller than what I was when I was 14. Because thin people are thin beautiful and successful. I want to visit my old coworkers and have them be fucking jealous. (yes. I am a worthless petty bitch.)\n\nI want so badly to hit 170 before I go home. I am obsessed with it.

I know these behaviors are toeing me in the danger zone. But I don't want to stop.

Just typical idle chit chat. He asked what I was gonna have for dinner. I wasn't thinking and said that I was probably going to skip because I wasn't hungry. He told me he was concerned about me. That I was looking really skinny. Thank God this was just text because I fucking smiled like psychopath. I was happy!\n\nI want to look thin, even slightly sickly.

I'm not looking for a diagnosis, I'm just curious to talk about some things I've experienced to see if any of you might understand.\n\n\nI suffer from pretty sever depression and suicidal thoughts I guess. It's been that way for a long time but the past couple years have been especially bad. Anyway when I'm really upset sometimes I just eat and eat and eat to try to feel something. 2500-3000 calories in an hour isn't out of the question at all. I feel like I just lose all logic and decision-making power and just act on raw emotion. I don't even think about what I'm eating, I just grab whatever pops out at me and devour it. Earlier today it was 4 full sized donuts, two butterfingers, 4 slices of leftover pizza, a few sodas, and a box of mac and cheese. This was all in about an hour, maybe less. \n\n\n\nI genuinely don't know or understand why I do it. It's like my mind just tells me that food is what I need to feel better and when I feel really bad it says I need a *lot* of food to make up for it. I guess I've really conditioned myself at this point to associate feeling really bad with eating a lot. It's like an automatic response. \n\n\n\nIt makes me feel so so so much worse. I hate myself for it. I've gained 70 pounds in the last 3 years or so. I have stretch marks everywhere that will probably never go away. I used to be really conscious of what I wore and liked fashion a lot but none of my old clothes fit. It all happened too fast for me to afford to replace them all so not only do I look like shit because of my weight I dress like I'm homeless half the time now. I've tried a million times to lose weight and I just literally fucking can't because any time anything bad happens I stuff my face and am too weak to stop myself. \n\n\n\nI have a big problem with self harm and have for a long time but this is one of the biggest triggers for me. When I eat too much I get extremely upset with myself and this usually leads to me hurting myself. I just don't understand how I can be so much weaker than everybody else. Nobody would say they *don't* want to sit and gorge on 2000 calories of desserts in one sitting but everyone else has the modicum of self-control it takes to not do that. I don't. I have no self-control to resist anything at all but especially eating. \n\n\n\nEvery second of every day I'm hyper aware of how fat I am now. I used to be attractive and now am clinically obese. My BMI is getting close to 33 at this point. All my doctors urge me to lose weight pretty much any time I see them but I'm way too weak to do that. \n\n\nI'm not seeing a therapist right now and although I'm scheduled to start with one they had a 983 year waitlist so I won't be in with one any time soon. I've seen therapists in the past but never talked about any of this and have never had a good relationship with a therapist anyway. \n\n\nI just want to be able to fucking like myself and my body again and have like 1% the self control and willpower that everyone else has. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't know or understand", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I really need a space to deal with some thoughts that I have that I don't express.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple of months ago I was discharged from an outpatient team where I received dietician advice and CBT. My weight was restored from slightly underweight to slightly above a healthy weight. However, I only received my period once due to problems meeting my calorie goals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have problems with over exercising, I do dancing and it's a double edged sword. It has given me strength and body pride and confidence that I never imagined I could have. It gives me a reason to eat so I can meet my goals. However, I exercise more than I eat so while I maintain a low weight, it's not enough for a period etc. My brain also created other problems like a fear of food poisoning to restrict the foods I feel I can eat.\n\nIt's frustrating as people tell me I look great, and I feel like screaming because it's based on a lie, my body and brain are still unhealthy. As a kid I was bullied for being fat, and now I get positive reinforcement of a body that's too small but it makes it harder to eat more and challenge the value I placed in being thin.\n\nI feel like I'm faced with a dilema as what I feel is 'enough' food clearly isn't, but average portions are an alien concept to me after years of this. I want to be able to do what I love -dancing- without feeling like I'm doing it to compensate. I desperately want to be able to eat outside of my comfort zone, get a period back, and stop fucking over my health because I've been at this for 8 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSlightly unrelated - I'm going on holiday with friends, and I've been in a minor realpse for the last few weeks due to an injury meaning I can't exercise. My ED wrecked the last holiday we went on. I really don't want to put them through that again, and end up there again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**: I need to try and fight these thoughts and get on with recovery, but it's so hard. It's so fucking understated in every eating disorder narrative I see, the recovery is glossed over, the challenges, the days where you just want to cry on the floor and you don't feel capable of doing it. When you doubt yourself over what to make, 'I want this, but do I *really* want it because it has less calories than this?'\n\nI feel like with every recovery step I take, I'm also tripping over rocks. I don't want to ruin my friends holiday again, and my anxiety is through the roof.\n\nDoes recovery get easier? How do you confront yourself? (challenge your fear of food, and exercising to compensate in daily life, the fear of social judgement from eating/gaining weight?)", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

Because I live with someone else, taking something out of an unopened food container has been a big problem, since this obviously means that I was the one who did it. To avoid this, I usually only eat something that has already been opened by them. I also always leave some food, so they have to be the one to eat the last piece and throw it the packaging away or I hide leftover trash from food until I can throw it away somewhere else where no-one can see or know it was me.\n\nHOWEVER, today I was the first to open up some cheese and put the rest back in the refrigerator. I did it for the first time in about 2 years! (No-one was here to actually see me do it or eat it, but hey!)\nRecovery is exhausting, full of relapses and often feels like there's no progress.

The dentist I had basically had no confidence these fillings will last. It was literally the most she could do &amp; abide by NHS allowances! They are composite resin I believe &amp; due to the large amount of space she had to fill they will be very weak themselves. She pretty much told me to expect them to fail, not to use them to bite or chew, but gave me no time frame they should be \"good\" for. \n\nThe problem here lies in that I am utterly terrified to eat! I *want* to eat but everything I want &amp; crave is crunchy! I didn't realise how weak they would be until after they were done. They look way better than they did &amp; another huge plus is obviously purging is out of the question. But so is binging &amp; just plain eating because I'm too scared in case I damage them.\n\nMy parents have very kindly offered to pay privately for me to have full crowns if these fillings fail but I certainly don't want to cause them to fail after spending a lot (to me) of money on them or waste my parents money!\n\nHas anyone had this problem before? Can they last well if I am extremely careful &amp; chew with my back teeth only, even on crunchy foods. I've been doing so well but I'm nervous this is really going to jeapordise my recovery.

I can feel lumps &amp; bumps all over &amp; behind the teeth which makes me believe the job isn't well done (which I'm sure isn't the case, she would surely have done her best despite me being an NHS patient) &amp; the imagined lack of integrity of them scares me so much.\n\nAny advice would be much appreciated. I'm sure I'm making a huge deal out of a very common thing, I can't be the first person to have some sort of \"cheap\" restoration done but my dentist doesn't know of my ED &amp; nor does anyone else except my husband who doesn't really seem to care.

I'm still trying to downplay it but not gonna lie, I definitely scared myself this time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo basically, I went out with my roommates last night because I was already drunk and didn't want to sit around at home.  I must have had about five drinks before leaving the house and then another four (that I can remember) while out. I had gin, vodka and soda, beer and whisky, and had eaten a total of 1051 cals throughout the day (mainly fruit/veg). Later when we got home I ate half an arrowroot cookie but felt the need to purge, so I did and this is when I threw up blood. And I'm not talking a little bit either, the pools were about the size of my fist. After this, I blacked out and woke up covered in my own bloody vomit. I'm not sure the reason for the blood, but for context I've been drinking almost every day for the last four months and eating less than 1200 cals a day (and burning about1200-1300 cals a day from my job). I'm prone to stomach ulcers and the stomach pains were similar to the ones I get when one develops, but I'm still concerned. Also, I don't usually purge (I've only just started within the last few weeks and usually only do it when I'm drunk) so maybe I'm just not familiar with its effects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the morning, the first thing I did was weigh myself. I finally hit my GW but I couldn't really be \"happy\" about it because of how physically weak and dizzy I was. I also had a splitting stomach ache but made myself drink a fruit smoothie anyways. I knew I had to talk to someone about what happened, and I had a few friends telling me to go to the ER, but I didn't want to spend my day at the hospital so I ended up going to the addictions walk-in clinic instead. The main reason I didn't want to go to the ER was because I was scared of being told that I'd have to go to IP treatment sooner than I had agreed to. Actually, I had called the intake worker to tell her I would commit to treatment yesterday morning, and even though my therapist and doctor want me to go ASAP, my ideal scenario is to go in the fall so I can finish working at my summer job so as to afford rent/tuition for the upcoming year. But I'm conflicted and really afraid to bring up this incident to my therapist next week... I'm terrified of being forced into going to treatment now rather than later because going sooner would screw up  my uni degree and financials, but I do realize that my ED is pushing me closer and closer to a full-blown crisis. I keep telling myself that agreeing to treatment is good enough for now, but I'm worried I\"m making the wrong decision with regards to timing.

{"post_id": "c12142", "created_utc": 1560632199, "title": "Stopped calorie counting, binge eating got better", "author": "Anly147", "self_text": "So, I kinda subconsciously knew for quite awhile that my calorie counting was only contributing to my binging, but I felt like I couldn\u2019t stop calorie counting because I thought if I stopped, I wouldn\u2019t lose any weight. I have some physical health issues that will improve greatly if I lose even just twenty pounds (trying to lose at least 40 total though, more would be better, but I digress), and, of course, binge eating doesn\u2019t help with that. I was really good at keeping up with calorie counting during the school year because I had set meal times (well, for breakfast and lunch, dinner was a free-for-all) and I exercised 5-6 times a week. Now, after exercising, I would have this huge sense of accomplishment because that meant that on top of the light calorie restricting I was doing (about 1700, so still a healthy amount of calories), my calorie deficit would increase by about another 350 calories, plus however much I was under my calorie budget. While this seemed like it would help me lose weight, it actually only kept my weight steady because I would sort of \u201csave up\u201d those calories and use it as an excuse to binge and I wouldn\u2019t track what I ate when I was telling myself that I would be using the previous day\u2019s deficit to sneak in another snack or two. Except it was just another snack or two it was a lot of overeating. Plus I would combing the previous days deficit with the deficit of that day and use that as a reason to justify eating more, so I never really had a real deficit to begin with, and then weekends were just free-for-all\u2019s where I didn\u2019t track at all. Now that it\u2019s summer break, I actually got too lazy to track because I don\u2019t have set meal times and set meals. I had been feeling like shit because I thought that after neglecting to track, I gained like 10 pounds and that would\u2019ve brought my weight up to 190. However, it had the opposite effect. Because even though I wasn\u2019t tracking, I was still mindful about what I ate. Even though I have binged a fair bit the past couple weeks, I actually have lost 5 pounds because I didn\u2019t know exactly how many calories I ate. I know it sounds counter-intuitive, but I think because I didn\u2019t have that caloric-deficit-means-I-can-eat-more mentality because I didn\u2019t know if I even had a caloric deficit, I was more mindful about not overeating. Of course, I have still binged, and I have still had the strong urge to binge, but it\u2019s not been nearly as bad since I don\u2019t know the exact amount of calories that I\u2019m eating and since I don\u2019t know that, I don\u2019t know how many more calories I can try to wiggle in to my day, and since I don\u2019t know that, I don\u2019t try as hard to wiggle as many calories in as I can like I used to, which has reduced the volume of my binges. For example, if I had like 170 calories left in my day I\u2019d try to wiggle in a granola bar and some kool aid and I\u2019d try to say that I was only drinking about 70 calories of koolaid and mentally try to tell myself it was only a small little cup of koolaid when it\u2019d really be an almost full cup of koolaid. Sorry about the wall of text and sorry if none of this makes sense, but I just felt like sharing the small accomplishment with y\u2019all. \n\nTL;DR stopping obsessing over calories made me lose weight", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

Went to two who I didn't like for various reasons, trying a third next week. Some things I'm wondering about:\n\n1) I don't really consider what I do \"restricting\" (I measure/weigh food and count calories) but one seemed kind of adamant that this was restricting. I would've thought restricting would be more like eating significantly below maintenance. What do y'all mean when you talk about restricting? What do you think therapists mean?\n\n2) The other told me \"you have anorexia\" even though I am not technically underweight and haven't been for about 15 years. Everything I've read suggests that being underweight is one of the criteria for AN. She doesn't specialize in EDs or anything so it just kind of limited my confidence in her. Is that dumb? \n\n3) just curious if any of you have been asked about c/s behavior. Neither of the two I saw asked about it (they both did ask about b/p which I don't do). Is it just less common and should I bring it up unasked? I haven't actually done it in a while but I used to more regularly. \n\nSorry if these are dumb or annoying questions,  just trying to figure myself out and this community seems super supportive.

I\u2019m anorexic and bulimic and clearly underweight, but it\u2019s on purpose and I\u2019m very aware of what I\u2019ve been doing and the toll it takes on my body.

My mother hasn\u2019t flat out confronted me yet, but I\u2019ve found papers with names of treatment centers for ED\u2019s. Is there something I can do to explain to my mother that I don\u2019t want help/ that I\u2019m okay? I\u2019m not that underweight and I don\u2019t plan on getting any thinner- just maintaining. I\u2019ve only purged recently due to the stress but under normal circumstances I don\u2019t purge at all. I know to someone who doesn\u2019t get it all of this sounds like I\u2019m in denial but I fully understand the consequences.

It\u2019s like I\u2019ve lost all self control with hunger cues and have to eat at least 2 good sized meals everyday and maybe even snacks. \n\nHas anyone else dealt with this/ how have you kick started your weight loss journey again? I\u2019m not like saying I\u2019m fat but the extra pounds on a naturally petite frame def show I\u2019m outta shape. \n\nTL;DR: semi-starting recovery did away with both binging and my motivation to be in shape. How can I motivate myself to exercise and eat less again?", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

The calm, happy folks are the ones who don't ruminate and can sleep well at night, have practiced adaptive coping mechanisms so that they can effectively deal with challenges and conflicts. People who feel emotionally well can lounge around indoors on a rainy day, and also find the joy to go on a hike with friends when the weather clears up. They don't have to use food as a crutch. They see the world as a fundamentally decent and safe place and over the years, it shows in their bodies as health and stable, normal body proportions. The bodies that don't have cortisol, adrenaline, coursing through their veins all the time... the bodies that don't alternate between drastic fluctuations in glucose levels (either not having enough glucose via starvation or having too much glucose via binging)... the bodies that feel safe and nourished enough to have normal menstrual cycles and get the beneficial effects of estrogen and progesterone every month... these are really going to be the signs of good health and attractiveness (a healthy hip to waist ratio, clear skin, healthy hair, a non-bloated face). And... the people who are truly attractive aren't even going to be the ones stressing about their appearance, because they have other things to do, and people to connect with and love, in their lives. This kind of all-encompassing health is not going to be found in any supplement, diet or workout regimen, or particular weight/BMI. It is really only to be found in the cultivation and practicing the skills, attitudes, of trust, optimism, balanced and nuanced (as opposed to black-and-white, all-or-nothing) thinking. So much of health is just about keeping a steady, balanced course, rather than anything revolutionary or drastic. \n\n\nNot everybody is fortunate enough to have been born into a calm, stable world, or have parents model adaptive coping mechanisms and conflict resolution for them.

{"post_id": "c15vr4", "created_utc": 1560657312, "title": "Help for Binge Eating Disorder", "author": "taraab123", "self_text": "It started when I was in fifth grade, my parents allowed me to stay home alone, and I finally had the opportunity to \"get into the kitchen\" and eat/sneak ice cream in private. Junk food was a forbidden fruit to me, and I'm not quite sure why, since my parents are both health professionals at healthy weights and encouraged us to eat balanced meals w/ veggies, carbs, protein and a treat per day and more on special occasions and generally had a good attitude towards food/exercise.\n\nEighth grade/ freshman year of high school, I thought I was obese and was determined to lose weight for cross country, so I would only let myself eat 600 kcals a day and I calorie counted religiously, and compulsively exercised in addition to the 2 hr workouts we were already doing. Around November, I had a really bad injury and basically couldn't walk until March of that year, or do weight bearing exercise until summer. I developed bulimia and gained forty pounds, and never really got over that, it just kind of devolved into purely binge eating. \n\nSince then (I'm a sophomore in college now) it has snowballed into full blown binge eating disorder, especially in the free-for-all-environment that was the required freshman meal plan and my roommates' food, which I would eat very late at night and then be absolutely mortified about later. Somehow I only gained about five pounds that year. \n\nNow that I'm living in an apartment on my own and buying my own groceries, I've generally done a lot better, but every time I think I've tamed the monster, it comes back with a vengeance. And I'm sick of it. Today that was going to the hotel market after a stressful three days, eating an entire pint of  ice cream compulsively with my fingers in the lobby restroom, not even waiting to take the elevator up. Like a drug addict would do. As soon as I came home, I promptly baked a cake, a cake that didn't even taste very good, and ate the whole thing in the span of an hour. I am now unable to sleep, my stomach hurts, and I am full of guilt and regret.\n\nI consider myself to be an athlete, on a club sports team at college, and I workout moderately intensely 30-90 minutes a day. I love it. And my eating habits hold me back from getting better and doing workouts to the best of my abilities. I am 5'5'' and 175 pounds, but fairly muscular (most people guess around 140-150). My BP is well within normal, and my resting heart rate is usually between 40 and 60. I feel like a complete fraud all the time, especially since \"athleticism\" is such a large part of my identity as a person.\n\nAll I want these compulsions to stop. I want to be able to eat three balanced meals and a treat or two a day without having food constantly on my mind. I want to be able to maintain a healthy weight (maybe lose 30-40 lbs) and truly enjoy competition. I want to go to a party, or a buffet, and enjoy myself in moderation without stressing or getting too full. I am sick of living life this way, a constant battle with the monster in my head. More and more I am convinced that this is a \"mental\" thing, perhaps connected to some overarching disorder, rather than just \"cravings\" or \"willpower\".\n\nWith my healthcare plan, I can't afford outside therapy, it is not something I feel at all comfortable discussing with my parents, and my school's waiting list is a semester long. I feel like the combination of non-HAES therapy and Vyvanse (or similar medication) would be a good place to start, but I'm not really sure how to go about getting the help I need. And I desperately need help. There is a part of me that wonders also whether I have \"adult ADHD,\" since I have most of the symptoms, and they are also severely negatively impacting my academic life. (ie. difficulty remaining focused in class and with schoolwork, very forgetful, easily distracted, talking excessively, needing to exercise in order to focus on basic tasks, tendency to interrupt others, \"spacey\", unorganized, etc.)", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I always used to control my weight purely through restricting my diet, but for various reasons I\u2019ve realized that I need to build up my athleticism as well.

Other then her coming out to me, my other sibling and myself have noticed suspicious behavior like: Excessive exorcise (hours of walking around outiside), disapearing in the bathroom after eating at reasturants, having extreme anxiety when ordering food, drinking 8+ cups of coffee a day, they went through a period of rapid weight loss (used to be over weight now is skinny but not under weight), my other sibling has found what might be puke in their bathtub, they complain of chest pain and acid reflux.  \n    My parents ignore my text messages that report these behaviors to them. They refuse to talk to me about these behaviors and I'm worried about the safety of my sibling. I finally got a one text message response after multiple texts stating my concern.

I am sure her acid in her stomach is high but she needs to start eat properly so her stomach heals I think she my need to get medication for her stomach to help get rid of the acid,she eat every night I always see her get in the refrigerator after we eat then so goes and eats something\"\n    I corrected them and told them that the dentist wouldn't be able to tell untill about 2 years of purging and that all depends on oral hygiene. I also told them that of course you see her eat you just don't see her purge. They are also basically admiting that they think telling the sibling in question to eat right is enough to make them do so.  They didnt respond to my text correcting their ignorance. I even offered to drive the sibling in question to the doctor incase they didnt have time to take the sibling in question themselves.

I\u2019ve been dieting since I was 16 years old. I am now 24. The thing is, I\u2019ve never been overweight (at most a UK size 10 at 5\u20192\u201d). I prefer to be somewhere between a 6 and an 8. At 16, I began eating 1200 calories a day in order to become \u201ctoned\u201d (ridiculous I know). Each week I would have a \u201cbinge day\u201d - I believe this was before cheat meals/cheat days became mainstream on social media. I think this is where my binge eating stemmed from.\n\nAs of now I am 55kg. I have lost 6.35 kg since this time last year, when I was at my heaviest. I really want to have a lean body and be really fit, so I go to the gym 4 times a week and still eat in a calorie deficit. I think I\u2019m the fittest I\u2019ve ever been right now, and along with this lifestyle change I\u2019ve been trying to curb my binge eating. \n\nI\u2019ve been doing well I think. Asking myself if I really am hungry before I eat things, eating enough so that I don\u2019t feel restricted and want to binge. But this weekend... it got to Friday and I said oh I would really love a big bowl of Mac n cheese. So I had it along with some chocolate. Then on Saturday I had a big share bag of chips, more chocolate and Mac n cheese. And then today I made pancakes with loads of Nutella. \n\nI think I\u2019m making progress, because I didn\u2019t binge all day any of the days, my other meals were my typical every day meals. If it was a year ago, I would have eaten shit all day for the three days and \u201cstarted again on Monday\u201d. \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to figure out is did I just eat those more unhealthy foods because sometimes you just have cravings and want to have things, or did I slip back into my binge eating ways. Because I didn\u2019t binge all weekend it makes me think I just satisfied a craving, but because I had these cravings and couldn\u2019t really stop eating these foods, I feel like I binged and am still restricting myself unknowingly thus leading to this.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience in this? Am I making any progress in overcoming this? Or are my thoughts and actions still disordered.

If you look back on my history you'll see a lot of disordered eating and thoughts, but I want you all to know they are fading away, I am regaining control of my life, everything in my life is getting better now, and you can do the same. \n\nWhen you get to the point where you're just done with living with an ED... When it becomes debilitating... When you can't do the things you used to do... When you've been dealing with it for so long that you're just tired of it... When you realize how much harm it is causing you both mentally and physically, and in so many other ways... You might decide to fight back and recover, re-learn how to live your life... And it's the best thing you could imagine. \n\nI had been living with my ED since the age of 14, when I realized I could lose a lot of weight by restricting. It then turned into an obsession. For 8 years, it would kind of come and go. Sometimes, I would spend all day thinking about food, restrict, b/p, all of it. But for what? I never even got \"thin\", I was still \"fat\" in my mind. I never felt healthy or confident, food made me anxious, I couldn't eat in front of other people. I wasted food. All my thoughts, my whole life was about food, calories, and weight. I shoplifted food from the store I was working at because I knew I was just going to throw it up anyway, and ended up getting fired and almost getting in trouble with the law, all because of my ED and my impulses. I injured my body. I didn't value my body at all. I spent so much time calculating the numbers that were going to go inside me but I didn't think about nurturing or healing myself at all. \n\nI made the choice to get help in March this year. Since then, I've learned a lot, but it's still a process. But I'm so glad I made the choice. \n\nThe first major step was to accept that what I had was a problem. I had been living with it for so long that I was scared to let it go - it was a part of who I was. As soon as I let it go, I realized I am so much stronger without it. \n\nAt first it was fucking hard, I'm not going to lie. Being officially diagnosed was hard to accept. Having to talk to my mom about it and her being unsupportive was hard. Going through all the tests was super hard, setting up my own bloodwork appointments was scary. Having therapists and nurses call me to check on me made me feel embarrassed and ashamed. Finding a place to seek counseling and setting up that first appointment made me cry. It was all worth it. \n\nI now go to therapy once a week and it's helping, it's making me realize things I never would have thought of about my ED. I journal, and have been for years, and I realize that every other entry since I was a freshman in high school has a list of all I ate, and how many calories it was. I didn't realize I was like this for so long until I thought about it... Therapy is helping with all of the hurt my ED caused me for so many years. \n\nThe thing that astonishes me the most, is the ED logic. The things that my ED was telling me was okay to do and not okay to do. For example, I couldn't eat breakfast because it was too many calories, but I could eat a whole carton of ice cream, some swiss rolls, and some twizzlers late at night as long as I threw it up. If I ate lunch, I had to skip dinner. I got a high from losing 2 pounds, but if I gained 0.2 pounds I would feel depressed, anxious, and overwhelmed. When I think about this \"logic\" it actually blows my mind that I was living this way for so long. It just really consumed me; I'm so surprised that I was able to function normally, go to school, hold jobs, have relationships, etc just like a normal person. \n\nNow, I am able to eat a normal amount of calories for my age, activity level, and weight, without thinking about it. I am able to work out without getting exhausted. I am able to live my day to day life without obsessing over food. I have a much clearer mind, and a much, much, much calmer lifestyle. \n\nI'm amazed that I can go out to eat lunch at a restauraunt, without googling the calorie counts a day before, and just eat lunch without planning it ahead, prepping to restrict to \"make up for it\". I am able to eat in front of other people without thinking about it as much. \n\nI STILL think about these things, I STILL have habits, but the difference is that they are not consuming me anymore. I am able to make the choice whether I want to listen to the ED brain or think logically. \n\nThe shittiest part about my ED was that I really just wanted to lose weight, be confident, and be attractive. I lost weight, sometimes, but I also gained weight. I never felt confident. \n\nThe funny part is, now that I'm able to distance myself from my ED, I actually lost weight the healthy way, I feel more confident than ever, and I feel more attractive than I've ever felt, both inside and out. \n\nI want to challenge you guys to really think about what your ED is holding you back from. It's hard to let go of something that is so rooted in you, but picture all of the things you could be doing, how much better your life can be. I had heard it so many times and thought \"meh\", but now I want to scream that RECOVERY. IS. POSSIBLE. \n\n&lt;3", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

My brother is severely handicapped and Im used to step aside. My father finally left us for a new family when I was 13 after years of fighting. Apart from being very judgemental and struggling with anxiety my mother would use food as means to control me, feeding me and making me feel guilty if I wouldn\u2019t eat. \n\nBut I \u201cbroke free\u201d when I was 15, feeling chubby through the changes of puberty, surrounded by skinny girlfriends in a small town. I started to control my own food. Dieting, exercising, more and more. Restricting, setting up rules and rules, adding to the ones I already made. Writing down every calorie from the catalogue in my head. Always a couple extra to be sure. It was a slow process but one with a steady growth of obsession.\nI started to lie to my friends about having eaten, about plans. How could I go out for Pizza? When I had to eat, I had to puke it out, discretely of course. They would get the wrong idea.\nBut surely I wasn\u2019t sick. Just disciplined. \nIt got worse when I got rejected by the  guy I was seeing.  He couldn\u2019t see a future for us but surely because I was just too fat. That started my final phase. I became the skinniest I\u2019ve ever been then I hit plateau. I couldn\u2019t lose anymore weight and my stomach was looking bulged. I panicked . My mother took me to the hospital. A 19 year old with a bmi of 16 to ask why she can\u2019t lose more weight. I got taken aside, told about my malnutrition, a protein deficiency that was causing the bloating. Something you usually see in the third world they told me. I should see a nutritionist. That was it. \nOk if I had to do that to lose more weight. Sure. Hoping it would kickstart the weight loss again I started binging proteins. I started to gain weight though. How? I completely lost control. I  gained weight so fast, non of my pants would fit me anymore. I trusted them\nIt was my senior year. I couldn\u2019t leave the house. I felt humiliated, ugly. I sunk into depression.\n\nBut that was a long time ago. I\u2019m 25 now. I know I had an eating disorder.\nI moved out a year  after I graduated high school. I started to truly read up on nutrition. I forgot the catalog in my head. I just eat healthy now. I could never eat a whole greasy pizza, enjoying it and without obsessing. But I can deal with that.\nI got a BMI of 21 (which I only know because I went to a doctor a couple weeks back. I don\u2019t check these things anymore). I live in a great city. I have great friends, who love me and support me and who know about my past. I pulled myself out. Because no one ever confronted me. Offered help. And it\u2019s my life after all. No one in my family ever asked me once to this day.\n\nSo happy end right? \nBut you can\u2019t pull yourself out. \n\nI still have thoughts. Nothing special for sure. Automatic responses I didn\u2019t even realise I had.\nWalking home after work? Burns more calories.\nSomeone eating less than me at dinner? Competition.\nPregnancy someday? Impossible.\n\nTo this day I think sometimes these thoughts also might be normal. What\u2019s wrong with wanting to lose a bit of weight? What\u2019s normal anyways? Maybe I\u2019m just being dramatic.\n\nBut when you realise it\u2019s not normal, you know you didn\u2019t beat anything. It\u2019s still controlling your life. Your decisions.\n\nThe worst for me is dating. \nDating, breaks-ups ,rejection. Depression, relapse.. it happened a couple of times over the years. \n\nA guy I was seeing told me out of the blue after weeks of affection he can\u2019t have a relationship while we were lying naked in bed. In my head he just wants someone skinnier.\nI could never talk about these thoughts.I would get called crazy. But I believe they deep down know it\u2019s true. These thought never go away. They never did.\n\n\nI\u2019ve been running 5k a day and doing sit-ups for a week. The thought of eating makes me feel sick. Saturday I puked out the little I ate. \nI don\u2019t want to relapse into this. And I know I will catch myself after a couple days. But it just keeps on happening. I just want to be strong and not having other people have such an impact on my health.\n\n\nI felt the need to share this somewhere.\nI don\u2019t want my friends to worry.\nBut I might also finally try to find some help for the long term.\n\nThanks for everyone who actually read all of it", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

This disorder has had such an enormous toll on my life. The resulting weight gain and shame has really sapped my self-esteem. And there's no one else I can blame but myself. And to add insult to injury, I really shelter myself from seeing old friends (potentially people who could help me) for fear of them judging me and seeing all the weight I gained. This is especially true since I knew them when I was very athletic.\u00a0\n\nIt feels like I've tried everything (mostly diets), but intuitive eating and eating in moderation never felt right either because my stellar \"intuition\" was telling me to binge. The only time I had some success was when I went on a medically mandated liquid diet (after surgery) and possibly lost my stomachs capacity to hold so much food. I lost a bit of weight in the process so I sort of coasted off of that momentum and became an avid exerciser and basically ate mostly vegetables to fill me up.

I immediately wanted to give in and go back for the buy 2 get 1 oreo sale that I have done the last 2 nights. \n\nBut, I reminded myself how awful and anxious I feel after purging. How much money I've wasted binging and purging. How much time it takes to binge and purge. How I'm never going to learn to properly cope if I never give myself space to do so. \n\nSo, I settled on going to the gym to burn off the extra calories. It's not ideal, but it felt safer than staying at home. It's on my campus (grad student) so I plan on doing an easier workout, taking time to write in my journal, and then doing some work on my thesis. This will delay me until midnight when the grocery stores close and I no longer can get binge food. \n\nNot ideal, but progress.

I had no thought and signs of my eating disorder. I stopped counting calories and enjoyed eating. I realized how much I miss eating food. I got in a relationship soon after  My boyfriend is also an athlete with a high calorie intake so we would constantly go out to eat or go to buffets.\n\nAfter game season ended we stopped training for a bit and I gained weight. \n\nI cried when i saw my body at the mirror.

ED thoughts have been with me since age 8 and the disordered patterns began at age 17. \n\n1 month ago I was at the lowest weight I've ever been, I was feeling amazing about it because I felt like I was accomplishing something for once in my life. I hated the restricting, the ocassional purging, how horrible and fatigued I felt. The cold, looking horribly pale... but it was all \"worth it\" because I was losing weight. Despite all of this, I was never thin enough. \n\nOne month ago is when I stepped on the scale and saw my weight 400gr heavier than what I had seen that morning and I panicked, I freaked out and cried so much, I cried and cried and cried until I was just in desperation. I called my mom and confessed everything to her. She told me to book an appointment with my psychiatrist immediately and that she'd go with me... and so the recovery journey began. \n\nBack on antidepressants and anxiety pills, next to those other meds I was already taking because my mental health tbh is like a roller coaster. Treatment began and my instant response was to REGRET opening up. \"Why did I do this?? They'll make me FAT\", \"I'm not thin enough to recover, my BMI is of 17.1, and to be sick enough it needs to be lower!!!!\", \"my body is disgusting, I will be even more disgusting now\". My eating disorder was throwing the biggest, most extra tantrums ever (and it still does that!) and it's got me fatigued. \n\nFood... I gotta eat it! I can't recover if I don't gain weight, right? Fuck, then this will be overwhelmingly difficult now. \n\nWeeks went by, I kept weighing myself every single day and I saw the number go up. Fighting with my family as I try and make them understand how I feel. Anxiety, obsessions and depressive thoughts 24 hours a day, the 7 days of the week. \"Just stop thinking about it!!\", they say, but will they ever understand what it's like to wake up thinking about this bullshit and to go to bed at night still thinking about it? Probably not. \n\nAs the weeks went by I also got more and more hungry, my appetite was growing and BOY that's difficult to process and to accept. The vicious cycle began:\n\nWake up - swear I won't eat ever again - eat - regret -eat - regret - eat - regret - eat - regret - go to sleep - wake up -swear I won't eat ever again... and so it goes. \n\nI'm tired. I can't stop eating and that mentally hurts me. I just wish to be unconscious, not dead but unconscious.  I feel so empty, this I am about to go to bed, swearing I won't eat again because I've gained weight and my ED is scared like crazy, but I know that I'll eat, and I know that the cycle will go on. I just see no point in trying anymore, but I will keep fighting. I will keep going to therapy and I will hopefully succeed one day. \n\nThanks for reading.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I don\u2019t weigh daily, but I still weigh weekly. I eat spontaneously,  but I make adjustments by removing other planned food to compensate. I OVER EXERCISE. I track calories, even though it\u2019s 2000 which is a lot. I weigh everything. Yes I no longer binge, but that\u2019s because a binge after a week of eating 2000/day is out of the question. At least when I was in a large deficit a binge wouldn\u2019t be too much damage. \n\nI still have so much anxiety over food. I was reverse dieting, adding back calories, but then I got pneumonia and had to stop exercising for a bit so now I don\u2019t feel justified in eating more when I am doing less.

You know you're trapped and you have all this advice to help and you have tools but you can't even find where or how to use them because your own mind is the thing holding you back. \n\nHaving an ED means it can evolve and change. Just when you think you're overcoming binge eating by working out and being healthy, you might end up with orthorexia. Orthorexia might become anorexia, or maybe your anorexia recovery can turn into BED.

Not kidding: I *never* think about food. Like, unless it's like \"should I put basil in my caprese salad or should I go to the garden and clip mint to be a lil extra.\" or \"should I take my partner to romantic restaurant A or B?\"\n2. Similar to #1, I don't find food interesting anymore. I don't want to see people's food on instagram or watch videos about food or browse the grocery isle for hours, or read menus on my spare time.\n3. If I eat 5 cookies, I don't call it a binge. I merely ate 5 fucking cookies. It's okay to eat 5 cookies. Maybe not every day because #health but like 5 cookies is not a big deal. \n4. I don't measure my peanut butter. Or olive oil. Or anything else with fat content. Y'all ANs know what I'm talking about and know this is a big fucking deal.\n5. I can have food in the house and not eat it all at once. I can have all kinds of food and genuinely just not think about it or remember it's there. The other day I **remembered** I had honey that I can put on my yogurt.\n6. I don't eat till I feel like I'm about to explode. Well... I have, at a wedding buffet. But it's not a regular thing. I eventually realize I'm full, but it's not even a conscious thought, it's more like \"empty plate, wash empty plate.\"\n7.  When I feel hungry, it doesn't feel unbearably painful anymore, because I'm eating regularly anyway. It's more like \"I'm hungry, but meh I'll wait since I'm eating dinner in an hour anyway.\"\n8. I don't really want the dessert, all the time. If I eat a filling meal, I don't really want ice cream after. I'm full and content (!?!?!? Still struggling to believe this feeling exists after meals)\n9. I can't finish meals that I used to eat ***multiple*** of. If I get a veggie burger, I can't finish it, whereas before I used to eat the veggie burger, and plate of fries, and eat 3 brownies, then follow that with a whole bag of chex mix or some other snack, and ice cream later.\n10. My usual breakfast is 600-800 calories: more calories than what I allowed myself for an entire day (when restricting). Part 2: I didn't know this till writing this post and thinking about it because I don't count my calories.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings that still suck that I'm still struggling with:\n\n1. Hearing a person of any size tell me how they think they're fat or should lose weight triggers me.\n2. Hearing a person of any size tell me how they skip a meal, or how they \"have no appetite, or when people talk about their eating habits in general, positive or negative in any way triggers the FUCK out of me.\n3. Hearing the word \"binge\" even if about \"binge-watching\" a TV show or in any other normal context. \n4. Clothes shopping....... (AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH). And being made aware of the appearance of my body in any way, positive or not.\n5. Though I don't think that I'm fat anymore, and I KNOW that I'm not fat, I still don't love my body really, I just feel neutral towards it.

Should I try to help, and if yes, how?\". \n\nfirst of all, i would suspect somebody has an ED if I observe certain warning signs such as: not eating at all, only eating very specific (low calorie) meals, not eating in public but taking a lot of food to their room, wandering around a dining hall for a long time before choosing anything. Obviously these things can have non ED explanations, and obviously there are other symptoms of ED not listed here, this is just a rough list. \n\nAnyway, if i am camp counsellor, and i am really worried about a hypothetical camper who has concerning behavior ... how should i even approach the situation? I wouldn't want to make it worse. the thought that their eating habits are being observed might push them to further restriction / bingeing. Moreover, i don't exactly have a solution as to how to recover, so i don't feel like i'm equipped to help them. i really feel like i would just want to go up to them and hug them and say \"if you're struggling i'm sorry, i can be there for you if you want\", but again, i don't know how to not make things worse. Also it's super weird if they don't have an ED lol \n\nso...how would you want to be treated in that situation?

I initially was just slightly underweight, but I took it WAY too far, and it was definitely a deadly situation.  Now, I love life again - especially being able to be trusted to stay healthy...my family isn't petrified for me, and I feel so glad to be no longer worrying them.  \n\nWhen I went inpatient, I was restored at just what *they (the team)* considered the cusp of a healthy weight. When I came home, my RD agreed that I was fine at the established weight. I felt fortunate, as if the fear I'd had for so long was not true (\"they'll make me \"fat\").\nI am grateful for life, and so grateful to be better, although I still do feel a lot of anxiety when I see myself walking around (reflection in a window unexpectedly, etc).\n\nMy question is: what if you settle at a slightly lower weight than that range they picked for you? I know all about BMI and healthy weight ranges. I remember what I was like when I didn't have an ED, but was still fit and ate with joy. I was what most people called, thin. My family is thin, none of us are big people, but we aren't extremely petite either.  My family is also all very into their fitness routines, and I often think we all are a bit disordered (except my amazing Mom).\n\nAbout 5 months after being back in my city/home, I was released from treatment by the local RD when I maintained the same # that I was at when I left inpatient. Now that about five more months have passed, and I have been more active, I feel like my clothes are a little looser. I do not weigh myself, but it wouldn't matter since I never knew the number anyhow. However, I feel I have lost a bit of weight. \n1. I still get my monthly cycle \n2. I'm working hard to eat better, but that is not perfect - I choose safe foods. I also allow a lot of time to pass before I eat, but I've done that since when I first returned. My RD told me to try and eat often, but I was able to maintain that post-treatment weight to her satisfaction. *Pre-treatment, I used to eat like....every 3 days. Very sad.*\n\n3. I love life, my mood is good, etc.\n\nThe question: Does a bit of loss - especially if I feel best and great about my body - mean that I'm defying recovery?  It breaks my heart to do anything differently than what I was \"taught\" in treatment, but nothing was easier than doing the right thing then...I was surrounded by peers and a 200% supportive bubble of anti-ED rules and care.\n\nMy counselor (therapist) says \"one size doesn't fit all\".\nShe also said that it is common for ED centers to sometimes do EVERYTHING they can to get the weight on, knowing that there may be a bit of loss when patients return home. (You are only in treatment for a relative blip of time - so they take it as their mission to make you as protected as possible, IMO.)\n\nFor the record, I am older (45), and I admit that I value being thin, but not sickly or underweight. In fact, the moment I think back to how terrible I looked (missing so much hair, skin grey, body scarily thin)...I am so glad to be where I am.  I also am still in therapy and she always compliments my recovery process, is proud of me, etc.\n\nMods, thank you for helping us post our requests, and as always, please feel free to edit if anything here is against the rules.

For the past couple years I have struggled with disordered eating and body image issues. A couple years ago, my mother (a dietician) realized that I was  underweight so she put me on a plan to gain a certain amount weight over the summer. At that point, I realized what I was doing was bad and was completely okay with gaining weight back until I gained more weight than planned. I then started to weigh myself everyday and obsess again over my weight. I rowed lightweight in high school and when it came time for spring racing, I was above the maximum weight by a couple pounds. I was able to lose the weight healthily to be able to race, but losing that weight put me back in the mindset of \u201cI need to lose weight\u201d. When I went to college this only got worse as the freshman 15 was my worst nightmare. I actually started skipping meals at the end of last semester because I had a goal weight in mind that I wanted to be at before I came home. \n\nLuckily, I didn\u2019t have a scale that I used regularly at school, so I couldn\u2019t \u201ckeep track\u201d of my weight, healthily or unhealthily. I weighed myself when I got home and realized I had lost a few pounds. I continued to skip breakfast and sometimes lunch because I wanted to keep losing weight. Now I have started to train again and am trying to eat 3 meals a day. However, today I weighed myself out of curiosity and am up a couple pounds since the last time I weighed myself. I immediately regretted doing that and am now trying to persuade myself into eating breakfast instead of skipping it to lose the weight. I have since moved the scale into my parents\u2019 bathroom so I won\u2019t be tempted to use it but am still struggling with the urge to restrict.

Nothing happened, but we made plans to get together the next weekend (last Friday). \n\nWell, basically, we had dinner and back to his place again. We cuddled, we made out, and I lost my virginity to him. Hell yeah\n\nThe only thing that unnerved me is that he was all over my body. Touching my thighs, my hips, my arms and stomach and shoulders. I know that that\u2019s generally a thing people do, but I\u2019m not sure how much of it was because he thought I was attractive vs he likes thicc girls\n\nCould I ask him about it or should I just let him be?

Normal weight, but flabby, so I wanted to lose weight.\n\nLast January, about 1 1/2 years ago, I developed an eating disorder.  Lost my period really damn quickly.  I restricted to no more than 700-800 calories a day, and that went on for about five months; I got to my lowest weight this way, around 90 lbs.  After that I was sick of eating so little, so I reverse-dieted to eating around 1300-1400 calories a day.  However, I still gained weight (some of it muscle from weighlifting, but definitely a lot of fat too) and from both higher calories and weeky/monthly binges, *I found my way back to 115 lbs without really even recovering.*\n\nI'm restored to my original weight, but I still have *no* period, and I was restricting, exercising, but gaining weight on low calories.  Thats called Quasi-recovery, I guess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, three days ago I finally decided to put my foot down and recover for REAL this time.   I've been eating what I want when I want, and I think I've been eating around 2500-3000 calories per day, by my estimation (I stopped counting).\n\nHowever, my question is this: since I started to really recover when I was ALREADY at my original weight, will I ever get back to my pre-ED weight?  Or after I have fully recovered, will I always be at my new higher weight?  I've never been above 115 lbs in my life, but now I will be.  I've heard about set-point theory and a lot of internet sources say that recovered anorexics \"will eventually go back to their pre-ED weight,\" but I don't know if that applies to me, since I've gained all the weight back but still need to actually recover.

I never thought I would relapse after how my ED nearly killed me a few years ago due to how dangerously low I let my weight get and how miserably unhappy with my body I was even then.\n\nIt\u2019s progressed to the point where he always insists on cooking breakfast and serving my plate so that he knows I\u2019m eating at least one meal a day. Heaping portions of eggs, steak, hash browns, biscuits and gravy, pancakes, you name it. He eats whatever he wants and stays lean because he\u2019s a pretty avid weight lifter, but I could not even begin to eat as much as he expects me to without gaining a butt load of weight.\n\nI usually sit there and just sip on a cup of coffee, dancing my fork around the food while I talk to him and distract him until he leaves for work.

Or when I literally put myself higher than others just because I have lived with ED for almost ten years (I am 20 years old right now) and haven\u2019t killed myself yet, and these thought lead me to thoughts of how I deserve more in this life and I deserve that people treat me better, more respectful, or that they should be really careful with me, especially talking about my lifestyle and choices.\n\nSometimes I get this pride from nowhere and sometimes I lose it with some other emotions and feeling and feel hatred towards myself.

I can have good months followed by catastrophic months that really take a toll on me. My relationship with food sucks. It\u2019s my only comfort sometimes yet eating gives me so many feelings of guilt and shame. It\u2019s a never ending vicious cycle. \n\nUp until recently I\u2019ve had a few good months but I\u2019ve had a tough few weeks. I\u2019ve been having some hormonal issues, some personal issues, and just received some terrible news (nothing serious, but sad nonetheless).  My boyfriend offered to take me out to get pho, my ultimate comfort food. This made me really happy because me and my boyfriend rarely go out to eat and as previously stated, pho is my go-to comfort food. \n\nI spent the entire day looking forward to it. I didn\u2019t eat breakfast, I had a few sheets of roasted seaweed for lunch so that way I could enjoy my favourite food and try to curb any \u201covereating\u201d guilt that usually happens when I eat out. For the first time in a while I was excited to eat something and really enjoy it. \n\nWe get to the pho restaurant, and I order a spring roll for me and my bf, a medium bowl of pho for myself, and my bf ordered a pork chop dish. When the spring roll came my bf didn\u2019t want his, saying that it was too greasy for him. Me, already chowing down on mine suddenly felt guilty, and couldn\u2019t even swallow the rest of it without wanting to spit it out. This set the tone for the rest of the meal.\n\nThen, our dishes came. Compared to my medium sized bowl of pho his dish was relatively small. We started eating but he finished his meal before I barely scraped the surface of mine (I like the broth more than the noodles so I take my time slurping).  Since he finished his plate before me, he just sat there and watched me eat. I always hate the feeling of being watched while eating so I already felt a weird pressure. Then he said In a joking way that I should have ordered a smaller bowl because I take forever to eat. This annoyed me but I couldn\u2019t help but feel increasingly self conscious. \n\nAs I continued eating we got into the subject of diets (ugh idk how) and how one of our friends has recently lost a lot of weight . And even though we were not talking about ourselves I couldn\u2019t help but feel completely attacked. Here I was sitting and shoving fatty broth and noodles down my throat while my friend was successfully losing weight. I asked if we could change the subject but my boyfriend continued to talk about it. I began to feel dizzy and ended up leaving more than half of my soup sitting in the bowl, feeling defeated. My boyfriend tried to convince me to finish and to take my time but I just wanted to throw up. I don\u2019t think I could ever eat my favourite food again.\n\nI haven\u2019t stopped crying and feeling guilty ever since. My boyfriend has apologized and I do forgive him because I knew he wasn\u2019t trying to be malicious. I just feel like I once again lost to my eating disorder.", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

Watch: [**Voices for Choices**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DVfYtZUxMc).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo summers ago, I watched as a good friend of mine in North Carolina was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital. Though he posed zero risk to himself or others, he was handcuffed, forcibly drugged, and locked in a psychiatric hospital for weeks against his will. I had experienced four involuntary commitments in my life, but witnessing him go through this traumatic experience led to me researching resources that could help him in his situation. By the end of the summer, I\u2019d traveled out to the west coast and met with members of MindFreedom International, and I began getting involved in what I came to learn was the consumer / survivor / ex-patient movement.\n\nThere was almost a decade between my first involuntary psychiatric commitment and my learning that this movement existed. Years were spent unnecessarily stumbling along on my own, seeking alternatives, trying to find allies, but always be alone in this journey and being hindered by constant self-doubt. Much like when I started getting involved in alternative education and it took a couple years before I discovered the already-existing world of self-directed learning and unschooling, I saw there was a need for a focused effort to connect those in need to the existing movements and resources that were available to them.\n\nIt was this need in mind that the Voices for Choices video series was conceived. \n\nThis video series, which consists of 13 videos, was a collaboration between many individuals including psychiatric survivors, alternative practitioners, artists, journalists, writers, and activists. I am grateful to have been given the opportunity to be a part of this project. I want to specifically thank a few people for their work. \n\nFirst and foremost, a special thanks to [Sherri Huang](https://sherrihuang.com/), the Editor and Associate Producer who poured endless hours into video editing and making critical editorial decisions that steered this project in a direction that would maximize its integrity and impact. Her journalistic approach, creative vision and detailed editing skills have no doubt transformed this video series from being an amateur home video project assembled by a novice learning to use a camera for the first time into a professional, first-rate journalistic production that will change countless lives. I am incredibly grateful for the sacrifices she made with her time to bring Voices for Choices to life.\n\nI also want to thank the team at [MindFreedom International](https://mindfreedom.org/), especially Sarah Smith, who was the champion of the grant which included the Voices for Choices series. While I was a part of the brainstorming session to plan the video, it was Sarah who took the lead in organizing all the documentation and drafting the grant proposal, securing the funding, and accommodating the regularly shifting deadlines that arose from my poor planning and execution. I\u2019m incredibly thankful for her making this project possible and being understanding in all the delays and requests for time extensions that I begged for. The Steering Committee including Cindy Olejar, Mary Maddock, Jim Maddock, Celia Brown, Ron Bassman, David Oaks, and Sarah Smith was also invaluable in navigating this long process of creating these videos and I am thankful to have had their experience and guidance.\n\nI also want to extend a sincere thanks to the [Foundation for Excellence in Mental Health](https://www.mentalhealthexcellence.org/), whose financial support made this project possible. While I am often skeptical that receiving funding for creative projects can potentially limit their freedom to free speech, the Foundation was incredibly supportive of our work and I\u2019m grateful that I never felt constrained or fearful in the creative process. Thank you for believing in this project.\n\nI want to thank all of the interviewees involved in the project: Kumail Akbari, Frank Blankenship, Erik Bray, Celia Brown, Oryx Cohen, Emily McMurphy, Sera Davidow, Janet Foner, Al Galves, Chris Gordon, Jim Gottstein, Peter G\u00f3tzsche, Chris Hansen, Jill Kesti, Mary Maddock, Hilary Melton, Grace Nichols, David Oaks, Opeyemi Parham, Ron Unger, Robert Whitaker. I want to thank them not just for their time, but specifically for their trust. It is not easy to have someone point a camera at you and ask you questions about such challenging subject-matter, knowing that they will be cutting and splicing your words into a larger story. I\u2019m not sure I have that courage and am inspired by all those who did.\n\nI want to thank my long-time friend Mark Sturgess and his partner Adam Carver for providing the music accompaniment. I\u2019ve wanted to collaborate on a project with Mark for years and finally found the perfect opportunity. The music in this videos really captures the emotional tone in a way that I never could have imagined. Thank you for lending your talents to this project.\n\nLastly, I want to thank Sean Blackwell. I first discovered Sean\u2019s YouTube series \u201c[Bipolar or Waking Up](https://www.youtube.com/user/bipolarorwakingup)\u201d in 2010, just a couple years after my involuntary commitment. It was the first glimpse I ever received into their being an alternative path to interpreting my experiences. I would say that his work directly inspired the strategy behind creating Voices for Choices series nearly a decade later. \n\nWithout further ado\u2026 please enjoy [**Voices for Choices**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DVfYtZUxMc) and share them with everyone you know! We\u2019ll be releasing one video every week for the next 13 weeks. I can\u2019t wait to hear what you think!", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

And I loved it immediately. But of course, as everything does, it pretty quickly got entangled with my ED.\n\nAt first, it really helped. I could actually eat food and not feel terrible about it. It got me think of eating as something good that I'm doing to take care of my body and help myself be happy and healthy, rather than some guilty, shameful habit that I'm disgusting for ever indulging in. I started making goals around being healthy and getting nutrition, rather than just exposing every bone in my body. It's helped me think about things other than food (mostly running, but even when I'm not thinking about running I don't snap immediately back into every though being about food.) Most people have told me running makes them ravenous, but I haven't had a single binge urge since I started. I still weigh myself every day, but I was so dispassionate about whatever number appeared and instead really cared about running progress. I used to purge with laxatives nearly every time I ate anything, but I haven't taken any since I started running.\n\nBut as soon as I realized how many calories I was burning running, the thought appeared. The \"think of how fast you would lose weight if you heavily restricted *and* kept running\" thought. I'm really starting to feel like I have to run off every single calorie I eat. If I *can* have a net calorie intake of zero for the day, I feel like I *must.* Its starting to get in the way of my running, because even though I know I need to take rest days (especially because I'm just starting out and I jumped in hard at 25mpw), I don't feel like I can ever take off a day and miss out on the calorie burn. And goals are getting tied up. Getting better at running being more important than losing weight has turned into \"if you lose the weight and get really skinny you'll be so much faster, better do it quick so you don't waste time for progress!\"\n\nIt's just so frustrating because I was so excited. I was so excited that I found something else I could really care about besides fucking weight and food and now my ED is gonna a ruin it too. I'm gonna get too skinny and weak and not be able to run. I'm gonna be too scared of the calories in the food and stuff I need to successfully do really long runs. I'm gonna overtrain because I'm trying to burn more calories and then get hurt and not be able to run at all. \n\nThis sucks. Why does this always happen?

Not perfect, but miles ahead of binging thousands of calories and hating myself, feeling utterly and truly hopeless. \n\nI even got this strawberry protein milk, and I\u2019m gonna save it for tomorrow, which I\u2019d never have been able to do before. It\u2019s either demolish everything, or throw away the evidence in shame. I think that bc I framed today as ok rather than as a failure, moderation became a possibility. \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized something really important. I might not feel great, but I did ok. As a perfectionist (aren\u2019t we all here?) if I allow myself to get caught up in the space between ok and perfect, it becomes so easy to throw the day away as a binge day, because I\u2019ve magnified the \u201cfailure\u201d. However, 1000 cal is still good. It keeps me on track towards my goal, maybe not perfectly, but that\u2019s better than going the opposite direction. \n\nAnd what the space between ok and perfect should really be, isn\u2019t a failure, it\u2019s a place where progress lives. Between ok and perfect is the spectrum where we can set goals and embrace growth. So even though I didn\u2019t do perfect today, I did ok, and I\u2019m perfectly happy with that, because I\u2019m in the right mindset and the right space now :)", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I'm suffering from severe gastropareisis, so I'm starting really slow (but, it's a start!) Anyhow, I had a question to post to the group...  \n\n  \n\nI am proposing that, for me, taking \\~2 weeks on being \"home-bound\" might help. What I mean is, treating/pretending that my malnourishment is rather a broken leg, of something else that required surgery. Hypothetically, I'm now recovering at home, but with help from friends and family.   I compare it to my family friend, who has a broken leg. She\u2019s stuck at home, with that cast. However, people come over, bring her food, watch movies, play games/video games, and support her mentally/emotionally. Right now, my \u201ccast\u201d is my lack of strength and stamina. But, creating a similar support plan for a few weeks to break-out of my \u201ccast\u201d seems really appealing and helpful, to me.  \n\n  \n\nObviously, I'll have established boundaries with my support system (already do), and it's more \"on me\" to reach out to them for help or support. But, I feel like sitting at home all day for a couple weeks, though anxiety producing when I \\*do\\* want to \"move,\" would be a good practice and foundation for continuing recovery into the \"real world\"/daily life.  \n\n  \n\nHas anyone else tried this way, before? I feel like it would be a way of giving myself permission to rest, eat, and watch netflix, play games, and plan my dream business (and do \\*nothing\\* else.) Again, will cause anxiety I am certain, but this would lessen with practice. What say you all? Thanks!", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

But I'm also struggling big time with my weight and wanting to drop again (maintaining in the BMI 20-21 range since leaving hospital). I feel like the only reason that I haven't dropped too far since leaving is because I have zero self control anymore and therefore suck at restricting. So today my psychologist told me she wants me to have two 'non-restriction' days, which will be over the weekend and then I'll see her on Monday. She asked me what that would look like and if I'd be willing, I felt on the verge of tears for a while and then bam! Tears. What the actual hell is wrong with me. I don't even feel like I have an eating disorder, I'm certainly not underweight anymore, and I have no self control, but I cried about being asked to eat over the weekend?! I am absolutely terrified. I have been eating much less than she thinks, but I feel like I really need to do this to see what happens.

Tried to put on some pants this morning and barely squeezed into them, which was a wake-up call. Now I need to figure out what to do.  \n\n\\---\n\nToday is the day that I finally realized I have an actual problem. I'm currently on work travel and I only brought two pairs of work pants. I've been wearing my first pair the first half of the trip and I could tell that they were a little snug. I just attributed that to bloating, which has been a reoccurring thing for the past few months. Then this morning, I switched to my other pair....and they're tight. I barely fit into them and they're squeezing all my stomach fat. I have no choice but to wear them because I spilled some coffee on my other pair. I feel miserable, uncomfortable, and huge. I hate how some of my fat is spilling over the top of my pants. They used to be loose on me! Now I can barely get into them and button them. I had to suck my stomach in in order to button it, when the waist band used to have a 1-2 inch gap from my waist. It's squeezing so tight that I already have indentations from it. It's a fucking wake-up call.\u00a0\n\nFor the past couple of months, I've been binging like crazy and I've gained weight that makes me want to break down and cry. I checked the scale one time (gained 5 pounds) and have been avoiding checking my weight again, because I know I've gained some more. I kept telling myself that it's ok, I'm just going to let my body have what it wants and I'll be back on track. That maybe by letting my body have all this food, I'll have more energy. Well you know what? I don't. Instead, I'm always tired, I feel heavy, bloated, my stomach hurts and is usually distended and hard, I feel lethargic and slow, I want to sleep all the time, I'm gassy, I'm either constipated or have diarrhea, I have so much fucking mind fog, my skin is dull and breaking out, I look swollen, and I barely fit into my clothes that I used to love to wear and felt comfortable wearing. My body is also looking soft and flabby. Eating at a reasonable deficit (when I severely restricted, that was a problem too) and going to yoga on a regular basis made me feel amazing. No bloating, my stomach wasn't swollen and puffy, I had energy, I felt light and able to move freely, and I could wear most things I wanted. I was also losing the weight I wanted off my body, till I fucked it up.\u00a0\n\nThe first sign BED started to appear was last year in late October. I was at my lowest weight then and I felt fucking fantastic. My friend came to visit me and stayed a week and that's when I started to let myself eat a bit more than usual, as well as eat things I normally would avoid (sugary, high-carb food). At the same time, I was also barely starting my anti-depressant medication which is the thing that really put me off track. Over the course of increasing my medication dosage, my cravings began to go out of control. It was the perfect mixture of things to trigger my binge eating. I craved sugary things so much that it made me feel so out of control. I would eat 2 packs of sour gummy worms a day, about 3-4 times a week, which is way too fucking much. Then some late evenings (4-5x a week), I would keep going back to the kitchen and keep making myself all sorts of food and getting snacks, when I was already full and hurting. I remember lying on the ground in pain, not able to move, because I just couldn't fucking stop eating. All I could think about was sugar and junk food. I didn't realize the connection between my medication and my cravings until it was too late.\n\nI got myself so deep into binging that I'm now having such a difficult time stopping. I've stopped taking my medication and it's helped a bit with my sugar cravings, but I still eat too much. It's like my body is hungry all the time. I hate it. When I was restricting, doing yoga, and consistently losing weight, I didn't have any cravings after the first week and a half that I started. Food was fuel for me, and while I did enjoy what I had, I had no problem waiting for my next meal and also not eating everything on my plate if I was served a big portion. I didn't have to eat at night and didn't feel the hunger pangs that I feel now. I could stop eating when I wanted to and food didn't control me. Now it does.\u00a0\n\nNormally, I'd forego breakfast and just have some coffee or tea in the mornings. That was the best for me because it allowed me to have a bigger portion for lunch and a small or reasonable sized dinner portion. I wasn't bloated. Now it's like every fucking hour of my life is me wanting food and wanting to eat. I wake up bloated in the mornings and then I make it worse by having breakfast when I know that it's just going to me make me feel even more blehhh.\u00a0\n\nI spent too many months thinking that it was just a phase or it's just PMS cravings or whatever else to make myself feel better. Now that I'm sitting here with my body squeezed into clothing that used to be a tad too big for me is the biggest slap in the face, wake the fuck up call I've had. I don't know what to do though. I don't know how to make things better. If I keep doing what I'm doing, I'll keep gaining weight, keep feeling miserable and sick, and hating myself more and more. Stupid thoughts keep popping into my mind like, \"You're never going to lose weight again. You don't actually have a problem, you're just meant to be this way. It's karma. It's not like you looked skinny anyway.\"\u00a0\n\nOverall, I feel so disappointed with myself. From 2015-2018, I lost 50 pounds. I had 10 more pounds that I wanted to lose and I was well on my way to doing so. Now I'm gaining it back and I feel like I can't lose weight again, as stupid as that sounds.\u00a0It's a fine line for me though, because I do also have severe restriction issues and body dysmorphia that I deal with, and binging triggers that so much. Instead of approaching binge-eating in a healthy manner, my solution is, \"Welp, I better not eat for a few days. Maybe only having 100 calories for 2 weeks would be best. I better run while doing those things too, that will totally help.\" I know logically that that's not going to help at all and make BED worse, I just want this weight that I gained off my body. It's so dumb because when I initially started losing weight, I did it in a healthy manner and guess what? It worked, woowww! Much better than the severe restricting/let's eat everything in the house cycle I've gotten myself into. Yet my dumb brain is pulling a dark kermit meme on me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd to top it all off, I feel like I didn't appreciate my lowest weight/size as much as I should have. My stupid brain kept telling me that I was still so big and that I still had so much to lose, even though I was pushing underweight and my doctor was getting apprehensive about me. Well, she doesn't have to worry about me being underweight anymore...woo...", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Please don't ignore me, I feel so alone =(", "author": "iwtgmahks94", "self_text": "Does anyone else do that? I've been eating in secret ever since I was a kid. I was bullied from age 6 to age 12 (and up until now, when I'm 25 but that was the worst of it) by my classmates, my cousins, and my sisters. They kept calling me fat and ugly. Idk about ugly but I WASN'T  a fat kid. I was just taller than most girls my age and my sisters so I weighted more compared to them. For my age and height though I was normal. But the constant bullying made me believe I'm a fatty so I told myself fatties eat so I would buy sweets and eat them in secret. \n\nThen when I was 17 I was in a manic state for months (I'm bipolar) and I was starving myself and exercising like crazy.  I lost 20 pounds and my body looked amazing. Everyone was all over me with compliments and ooh ahhs and shit and even people who bullied me would kiss my ass. \n\nBut around the time I lost all the weight I got really depressed and I started gaining 20 pounds a year from 2012 to 2018. My binging became horrible after I went to live on my own for college in 2013. When I was a child and with my parents I would eat a chocolate bar in secret. When I went to college I'd pick a restaurant and order 3 different meals from it. So I've gained 140 pounds =(. Obviously, I feel like shit and I've lost all my social life because I'm too ashamed to go out of the house. I've been in therapy and meds since 2014 and my depression and bipolar have gotten better but still, this is the first time I'm saying these things to anyone but my head. \n\nI'm TOO ashamed to tell anyone else, you have no idea. I'm so triggered by being called fat that even implying that I like food terrifies me, let alone admitting how much I binge. When I was at a normal weight I pretended in public that I didn't like food and that I forgot to eat like \"omg look at me I'm one of those skinny girls\". But now everyone can see the rolls hanging off my belly and I can't fool anyone. I feel that everyone judges me and they do. People love telling me how they feel about my weight to \"help\".\n\n I'm so hurt and embarrassed that it makes me binge even more. But now I'm also battling the habit of eating junk food. Back in September of 2018, I started losing weight and by November I'd lost 40 pounds. I was super happy but after that, I got into my old habit of ordering takeout again not because I had the urge to binge but just because it's become a habit that I cant break. It's automatic now like brushing my teeth. \n\nFrom november till now I keep losing and gaining the same 8 pounds. And the funny thing is when I'm good and make the bare minimum effort I shed pounds off without having to starve or workout like crazy. Why won't my brain leave me alone and let me diet in peace? And why on earth can't I tell my fucking therapist when I know he can help me and that my weight is literally 90% of my depression right now? Why do I keep sabotaging myself??\n\n Do you know what else I don't get about myself? When I was thin I was fucking gorgeous. Even now people tell me I have a gorgeous face for a fattie. So when my body was nice as well I looked like a fucking model. I'm not arrogant I swear, back then I thought I was the ugliest person on earth but now I look at old pictures and I think what the hell, I was beautiful. People always LOVE to remind me that as well, including my parents. They always say omg why did you get so fat, you used to look amazing. Another thing that triggers me and makes me punish myself with food. God, I'm begging, someone help me. My life is miserable. I've already lost 7 years of my life to depression and food.

Needless to say, halfway through our work out I had already planned an entire b/p ordeal in my mind.\nSo, as soon as ya girl leaves the gym, I headed straight to the grocery store down the street from my place of residence. I then proceeded to walk in, basket in tow, giving absolutely no fucks as I go around the store grabbing all the #essential. This list included: A box of frozen California pizza company pizza, 2 sleeves of little Debbie mini frosted chocolate donuts, a large back of exxtra-hot Cheetos, and a single 20oz bottle of pepsi 0. \n  \n  See the reason I gave no fucks is because this little grocery store had recently opened a self checkout station that I fully intended to use. *SPOILER ALERT* I did no such thing. \n \n  On my way to said self check out a very sweet young cashier asked me if I was ready and if I'd like to go through his line as it was pretty dead and he almost seemed desperate for some sort of task to do. So me being the type of bitch that just can't say no, went in his line. Let me tell you I've been plenty embarrassed multiple times in my life but fuck man this was some soul crushing cringe imo.

There have been a handful of times when I thought I was recovered. Turns out, I was absolutely not.\n\n First was at the peak of my bulimia that I had been struggling with for about a year and a half.I finally told my parents and sought out therapy. I eventually stopped purging and told myself I was better....Except in replace of it, I started exercising excessively and did the whole IIFYM thing where I counted literally every possible calorie(including fish oil supps) and I told myself it was all  healthy.. I dropped about 30 lbs with in maybe 2 months because I was only eating 500-800 calories a day and/or excersing 2-3 hours a day to make sure I was in a \"deficit\". Then a few months went by, and I started dating someone. He was amazing and patient and I opened up to him about every part of my ED. He dealt with all my psychotic mood swings and pickiness about food and restaurants. We traveled the world together and I started eating normally. I thought I was recovered....again. I was indulging more, exercising less, not really caring about what or when I was eating, which of course resulted in me gaining weight quickly because my metabolism was screwed(one of the perks of EDs).  \n\nThe weight gain started to affect my self esteem and made me feel so insecure and crazy. I would push my bf away all the time because of my insecurities. Always thinking he would leave me for someone thinner like how I used to look. He never did. He was always telling me how beautiful I was and he didn't give a shit about my weight...but eventually my anxiety and ED got the best of me and I made up some excuse to break up with him.\n\nThis lead to the rollercoaster of reationships ive had and ended in the last few years. This disease has made me push everyone away. Not only lovers, but my best friends and family. It has kept me from wanting to open up and meet new people because I am scared they will only think of me as the girl with the eating disorder( I know that's not the case, but that's good old anxiety for ya). I thought I was recovered, so I convinced everyone in my life I was too. Now that I realize I am not, I am so afraid to open up to them about it again. This disease feels like a prison. I feel like I have wasted so much time thinking about food, or my weight or how I look. \n\nThe last few months have really urged me to get help again. I am seeking out therapy, hoping ill find someone I feel comfortable around(last time I cycled through 4 different therapists until I found the right fit). I've been buying all the self-help books and audiobooks. I want to FINALLY RECOVER. I know it's possible.  I just dont know what will be the turning point for me to finally be done with this. .", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

My peak weight was nearly 400lbs and the last time I weighed myself I was 227, but recently I\u2019ve noticed that I\u2019ve been binging a lot. A few months ago I got out of an emotionally abusive relationship, she was toxically manipulative and treated me like I was property, it got to the point where I just couldn\u2019t take it and I cut all ties with her, before the relationship I was (mentally) at my peak. I wasn\u2019t binging and I was pretty on track with my needs, I had no problem socializing and I was comfortable with being alone, but after said relationship I just became really depressed again and have been finding myself in an unhealthy self pitying mindset, I binged a little here and there but I ended up learning about intermittent fasting and started trying that, to some fruition, but in the past few days I just started binging as soon as I got home, typically during the night. And I realized that this was a cognitive pleasure seeking cycle very similar to when I was at the height of my substance abuse, a few years ago I was caught with weed in my pocket and was arrested for a DUI, while I was neither high nor drunk at the time I had it in my system and was put on a very strict probation called TASC, they took a urinalysis  sample from me every few days and put me on drug and alcohol eduction classes where I learned a lot about the dangers of what I was taking very lightly, I haven\u2019t used marijuana in well over a year, and I don\u2019t let myself drink often, and when I do I leave my card at home and only bring 10 dollars as a budget. When I was a child I was diagnosed with Aspergers and one of the many side effects is OCD, with OCD you find yourself faced with (what feels like) uncontrollable urges, when I was using i turned to drugs and alcohol to cope and I ended up falling into a compulsive spiral where I would use until I was out of my supply, some nights I would drink an entire handle of whatever liquor I could find as I wasn\u2019t 21 at the time, some nights I would smoke a whole eighth (the most I could afford to buy at a time), now whenever I cope I just ended up eating myself out of house and home, that being said some of it is natural as I\u2019m pretty active and go to the gym nearly every day, but most of the time I just end up eating until I feel sick, I haven\u2019t been fasting regularly and when I do I end up feeling pretty down for the whole day, and now I\u2019m wondering if all of these come from the same place, a need to make myself feel good to avoid the actual coping of my problems, any thoughts on the root of BED or is it different for everyone\n\nTL;DR: I\u2019m starting to wonder if the root of BED comes from a similar place as substance abuse or OCD", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I worry constantly about gaining weight and the saturated fat and sugar content in everything I eat. I don't count the calories of everything I eat exactly but from what I can gather I've been eating under 1500, and a lot of times under 1000, a day for a long while.\n\nI was already trying to lose weight around the beginning of May, when I went to a Doctor's appointment and noticed I was a much higher weight than I was a few years ago, almost 175 pounds at 5'4. It made me shocked and scared and worried that I would just keep gaining, so I decided to severely limit my sugar intake. I didn't completely stop eating snacks and sugar, but just limited them. But as time went on, the feeling that I needed to lose weight heightened, and although I don't have a scale at home, I was happy to see my waist get slimmer over time.\n\nIt got really bad when I had blood work done and my cholesterol came back as higher than it was two years ago, and I was told to limit my carbs and fats. From then on it's like my brain went into panic mode. I can't eat any bread products without being overwhelmed with guilt, and feeling awful if I eat any sweets. I tried to give myself \"cheat days\" on the weekend, where I just eat whatever I want, but those don't even work. If I eat anything unhealthy I just feel like I made a mistake, and don't enjoy it. I've started to feel good when I'm hungry, like I'm doing \"the right thing\", and have fasted for over 24 hours without even realizing.  It doesn't help that I'm severely depressed and despite my efforts I haven't found a good therapist or a way to keep my sleep schedule regular, so there are lots of days when I sleep from 4 or 5 in the morning to 3 or 4 in the afternoon, missing breakfast and lunch so I only have to eat dinner.\n\nI don't think losing a bit more weight would hurt, but I also know that doing it this way and being constantly afraid of food and eating food I enjoy is hurting me for sure. I know that continuing to starve all day will kill me if I do it long enough, and that really terrifies me. I don't want that to happen, but the fact that I drank a vitamin water and had some ice cream despite only eating 2 small slices of pizza to eat today is making me want to cry. A week ago I had hardly eaten anything and was so fucking hungry in the middle of the night but started to cry because I drank half a bottle of raspberry Snapple, which I love but feel I shouldn't have anymore because of the sugar content. I'm trying to break out of these patterns but it's really hard. It doesn't help that I've lost weight, and I'm sure people have noticed, but no one's really said they're concerned, so I'm taking that as them approving of it, and dread gaining any back for fear of people being disappointed in me. These thoughts are haunting me right now especially, since I'm fighting not to go back to the kitchen and eat anything else even though I'm really hungry.\n\nSorry that this is so long and disjointed, and I've probably left some things out, but I needed to tell someone, and I can't talk to my friends or family. I'm not sure what I should do. I don't want to go back to eating unhealthy things all the time, but I also don't want to get sick or hurt myself from starvation.

I have been mostly recovered, but because of stress from school I lost some weight unintentionally from a disrupted sleep and eating schedule. This unintentional restriction triggered a kind of relapse, where I have been binging pretty often for about a month, sometimes purging but for the most part trying to at least maintain *that* aspect of recovery. \n\nI keep telling myself that everyone overeats but if I purge again it\u2019s really over and I\u2019ll be back in the constant hell I was in, but it\u2019s hard. In the period of about two months I\u2019ve gained xx lbs and because I\u2019m short I\u2019ve crossed the threshold from normal to middling overweight. I feel disgusting and uglier than ever at my highest weight ever. To make things worse I have a doctors check up for the first time in a long time in two weeks that is really making me anxious... my eating disorder isn\u2019t on record here because I see a school therapist out-of-state so I doubt that there\u2019s any information on it. Furthermore I stopped seeing my therapist and so my records were expunged as well as part of policy.\n\nI don\u2019t want to elaborate to my doctor about my eating disorder. Partly because my mother who is controlling but whose health insurance I\u2019m on may be present, and she has encouraged my bulimia before, so if she knows I\u2019m medically overweight she will hurt me, eg she has told me to go vomit after meals explicitly because of it. The ideal solution would be for her not to be present but there are also other problems. \n\nI know I should be concerned about my health first and foremost and thus be honest, but being medically overweight as well as my highest weight is making this very troubling for me. I can barely sleep because I think about the doctor telling me I am disgustingly overweight and what my diet is like, what exercise I do. The most I can think of is that during final exams I gained weight and that I\u2019m working on losing it, but I feel judged and really horrible to the point that I feel like I will relapse completely. \n\nCan someone share experiences with doctors and what they\u2019ve said in similar situations? Is BMI and weight a huge topic? Do they tend to lecture a lot? It would mean so much if people could share stories... I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m sensationalizing the idea from my own insecurity and it would really help me. For reference, it\u2019s a general check up. Thank you.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I have always been a picky eater. I have always simply eaten when I am hungry. I\u2019ve never restricted myself. Ive always been underweight, but not as underweight as i am now. I DESPERATELY want to gain weight. I don\u2019t like being skinny. I want to gain \\*\\* pounds. I\u2019ve been trying to gain these \\*\\* pounds for over 2 years. But I just don\u2019t enjoy eating. I take a few bites of something and, even though my stomach isn\u2019t full yet, I no longer have the desire to eat. I basically only eat the bare minimum to shut my stomach up. I set alarms to remind myself to eat, but nothing sounds good. Ever. I try to think of literally any fast food/restaurant, ANYTHING that might sound good to me, and nothing. Nothing ever sounds good. I am always forcing my food down. Sometimes I choose to eat foods that are easy to swallow just so I don\u2019t have to gag while chewing. I just want to be able to enjoy food like a normal person. I\u2019ve tried working out to stimulate my appetite, but nothing changes. I am more hungry, but I still don\u2019t want to eat.\n\nI have no idea where this comes from.

Because there is no way this is just all in my head. After a few bites chewing anything makes me gag. I go a full day without eating because nothing sounds good. I usually also feel nauseous. And then I beat myself up about it because I will never reach my goal weight this way. I force my food down by putting it in my mouth and then drinking a ton of water. And I usually cry while doing it. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me. Why can\u2019t I love food? Everyone around me is always eating these bigger meals and I get so jealous.

{"post_id": "c3nxxm", "created_utc": 1561197686, "title": "Request: I can't deal with this on my own any longer", "author": "EDPostRequests", "self_text": "Hi there. \nI have been slowly devolving into what I believe is bullimia. Basically, I began exercising and using MyFitnessPal like two and a half years ago. I started at too low of calories, would last a few days, then binge. I upped my calories, would last a week or two, then binge. I began making tweaks to my diet/exercise to reduce the binges. The effective changes included returning to basic CICO with less strict rules about macros and 'bad' foods, fasting longer earlier in the day to accommodate my stronger feelings of hunger later in the day, and adding some cardio which seems to reset my appetite/declutter my brain. \n\nI was doing pretty well for a while. Binges were smaller, less frequent, and more controlled, and often I could easily offset them by eating a bit less the next day or moving more. I think I was doing my best with a routine, with knowing when my hunger strikes, with knowing when I would have the energy to work out, and maximizing this knowledge to stay fit while still enjoying food. Then I really fell off the wagon due to a complete loss of routine. I got really busy socially at the end of the year- drinking alcohol much more, eating weird food at weird times. I began taking more creative (a.k.a unhealthy) measures to avoid weight gain- I would skip dinner if I knew I would go out drinking that night, I would spend a day after a big drinking day on Adderall and consuming only water or gatorade zero all day. Then I started cutting corners more, which led to self-induced vomiting. If I got drunk and ate junk, I couldn't just move on, I instead would go in the bathroom and try to puke up all the calories I could. Honestly, it felt like a resolution to my struggle: I could still be \"cool\" and drink beer and eat pizza with my friends, yet stay thin. \n\nBut it started to spiral into a habit. I came home from college and spent my free weeks before starting my job in a totally wacky state of mind. I would binge on foods until my stomach hurt then throw up. If I didn't want to keep doing that, I would buy junk food, chew it, and then spit it out. If I binged and didn't vomit, I would try to fast binges away in the days after. \n\nI feel like switches are flipping on and off in my mind. I feel like I am completely consumed in an ongoing battle of wanting to stay thin, and wanting to eat everything. One day, I'll eat reasonably, exercise, and go to bed without even a typical nighttime snack. The next, all I can think about is food, and I'll challenge myself to not eat, and then something triggers me and I lose myself in another binge. Every time I think I'm finally feeling normal again, I suddenly get the emptiest feeling in my stomach and all I want to do is give myself the freedom to eat whatever. Then I do it, I eat one cookie, and I immediately feel mad that I'm reversing my progress. Then I say well it's fucked and I eat way past feeling satiated. Then I get mad again and I make myself throw up or starve the next day. I'm sure this sounds familiar.\n\nIt's not necessarily the actions of bingeing or purging that are infesting my life, but the way this whole cycle consumes every waking moment. I feel like I have no concept of hunger nor fullness. I am constantly planning in my head how I will avoid calories/meals and burn enough calories that day. I struggle to commit to social plans if they surround eating. If I don't let myself have that one muffin, I crave it for hours after. If I do let myself have it, I feel intense guilt for hours after. If I'm out with friends and know I'm going home soon, I intensely brainstorm the perfect snack at home that will optimize deliciousness for the lowest calories. \n\nSo yes, I think I have an eating disorder, and I think it's becoming more and more intrusive on my life. I set up an appointment with an ED specialist, then I just ghosted her out of total fear. It's been a week and I have still been too ashamed to call her back. \n\nI am begging for someone to please tell me one thing I can begin to change right now. It doesn't have to be a grand action.

I'm 43, she's 38. We have two girls, 5 and 1. I'm looking for advice on how to get her better help.\n\nAbout a year into dating, she revealed to me that she \"sometimes likes to throw up\" after eating. At first I thought she was kidding, as we were having a light hearted conversation, but she was dead serious.\n\nAfter we moved in together, I noticed the purging and encouraged her to talk to her GP because it seemed to be starting to affect her health. I think she did that. Eventually, she stopped purging most of the time from what I could tell. There is still binging that comes along with it, at varying levels. \n\nLately, she doesn't eat dinner with the kids and me and instead I'll find dirty dishes and empty containers hours afterward.\n\nThis has been going on since she was in college (almost 20 years now), and I just don't know if there's anything I can do to encourage her to make changes. \n\nPossibly the bigger issue is what I understand is a big component of eating disorders: not knowing how to handle emotions and turning to food instead. Strong emotions bring out a ton of anger at times - even leading to mild violence toward me in the past. I am wary of talking with her about controversial topics between us / hard family topics because she'll just get furious -- even if it's something she knows we need to discuss.\n\nI don't think I can stay married to her if she can't get the right help.\n\nShe does go to a therapist but I have only been seeing her issues get worse since our second daughter was born. She gained weight after our first daughter and much more before and after our second.\n\nI've read the posts here on \"how to talk to your loved one,\" etc., but I've frankly gone down many of those paths in the past decade. She has gotten help, but I don't think it has been the right help.\n\nYou'll noticed a lot of \"I thinks\" above. She often tells me that she's doing something to help herself, but then I find out that she lied about it. I want to be there for her (and I think I usually am), but it's super hard without knowing the truth about what's going on for her.\n\nSo, how do I talk to her about getting help without triggering her fury? Also - where do spouses go for support, if anywhere?\n\n-----\n\nRelated, but selfish: There's things that come along with her disorder that bug me. She just won't accept that they're issues for me and gets angry at me if I bring them up. This is really secondary to finding a way to get her help, but I sort of want to have the freedom to say it aloud, so here goes:\n\n- Eating treats that I buy for myself and not telling me until I discover they're gone\n- Making a mess of food waste, wrappers, etc when she does binge without cleaning up after herself\n- When purging, not cleaning up vomit around the toilet and other places it splatters", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

I met my boyfriend, I regained like 15 pounds and was really close to being at a healthy BMI. I was doing well eating wise and didn't care for over half a year, I even unsubbed from here for a small period in time, and was generally inactive.\n\nAaaaaaaaand then I had to move back in with my mum like two months ago. I lived alone for a year, but I lost my job. It's worth it here to note that I lived with my dad, her ex, for a few years and that him and my step-mum were malicious, controlling narcissists that drove me into a decade of self hatred. They walked in and out of the bathroom while I was showering and insulted my body, they threatened physical violence, they made my friends their friends and then turned all of them against me. My dad would come to my friends' birthday parties and play the cool, young dad. \"Look how pretty my daughter is! She's so smart, I'm so proud of her.\" then go home and tell me that I was a worthless piece of shit. That was dysphoria XL Y'ALL.\n\nMy stepmum would scold me for leaving a pair of underwear in the bathroom.. in front of a friend that I had over because \"that way, the lesson is more effective if you're ashamed and people can see how disgusting you are!\". They searched through my shit, my dad even moved me to the school he was teaching at so he could control me more. I was held down when I had meltdowns, I was laughed at for crying, I was thrown into pools when I hated water, I was slapped on the ass when I had a fear of physical touch. I'd be scolded for going to the bathroom at night or being a minute late to dinner. I was told I was worthless, unworthy, and just generally a waste of life. I have never heard the word \"love\" come out of their mouth.\n\nAlso note that I was the only child out of 4 that got treated this way. I was the first, and the other ones are treated with lenience and generousity, except for a few exceptions. TLDR; I was abused, they weren't.\n\nSo, I guess you can assume that I don't react well to feeling watched or feeling like I don't have privacy. I also don't let my family know what's wrong with me. They all think I'm strong, confident, pretty and arrogant through my history of bullying and narcissistic abuse. Here am I with severe anxiety now studying psychology (forensic to be exact, so all this will literally be my job). One good thing that came of my family history was that I'm now fucking brilliant at reading people and knowing what's going on behind their face. I give amazing advice because I GET PEOPLE. I have experienced the whole range of emotional fuckedupness there is. I have a genuine intention to help people and give them good advice and my family says \"you're not an anxious or insecure kind of person, Lisa, so don't act like you can give advice to people who are. You'll never know what it's like\". Lmao ok.\n\nAnyways. Moving on.\n\nI never noticed how fucking disordered my mum is, y'all. She drinks a small bottle of wine or prosecco every evening and has to weigh how much there is in each individual glass. She went vegan once and felt better, and then stopped after two months. She consumes SO many diet products. You're dead if you give her anything but black coffee. She doesn't cook lunch or dinner for my siblings, we're lucky if we get one warm meal every two days. Breakfast doesn't even exist in our household. She never eats with us. She'll eat nothing all day and then eat a full bag of chips or something in the evening, all that shit. She buys us all these high calorie snacks, sweets, pizza, whatever so we can fill up on shit without her having to touch healthy food over the day.\n\nSo look, I have the UPMOST understanding for hating food, having a fucked up relationship with food, and all that. But she's harming other people with it too. She knows nothing about my disorder, in fact she knows me as a very self confident and fit person. I was getting pissed that my siblings and I didn't have anything to eat, so I confronted her with how fucked up all of this is. I told her that I fucking need food and that I want to live healthily, not on chips, chocolate and cookies.\n\n\"Mum, I had to coach my best friend through eating disorder recovery for years and had to watch her be miserable, I had to listen to my dad call me a fat, ugly whore, had to listen to him laugh at me and say I'd develop an ED because I'd want to impress my best friend. All because I didn't know what to put on a slice of bread. I had to not let that get to me when I was fucking 14 and everybody was calling me ugly. I had to maintain a healthy relationship with my body throughout all of this and months after I finally start exercising, after I finally get my nutrition in order, I need to watch my body go to shit because I'm sustaining it with a diet of chocolate and chips? Because I'm a strong person, I can deal with all of it and I've become who you know me as now, but for the love of god, GIVE US ACTUAL FOOD. IT'S YOUR PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY.\" (Let's not mention that I was not strong enough. She doesn't have to know that.) **She didn't say anything.**\n\nEver since, she has been fucking WEIRD. She used to comment on my body before, saying that I was too thin and when I put on five pounds, she touched my stomach and said I was getting \"pudgy\". But this is getting out of control. She will constantly stare at me, at my legs, my arms, and tell me how beautiful my shape is. I'll be right next to my 15 year old sister and she tells me how pretty I look, completely ignoring her other daughter, that is just as pretty. I felt fucking AWFUL. I tell her not to bring me snacks and all and she still does. She went on vacation and brought us gifts..... Drawing supplies for my sister, a special stone or something for my brother, and Marzipane and sweetener for me???????? \"bECauSE iT wAs PrETtY\"????????\n\nWhenever I go downstairs to go the bathroom, she doesn't say a word. When I go to the kitchen, she gets up and follows me. She'll look at how much milk I put in my coffee, how many chips I take, how many vegetables I'm eating. It's her birthday today and two minutes after midnight, she asked me whether I'd finally eat the cinnamon roll she brought me, for like the FIFTEENTH TIME THAT DAY. She'll look around my room and turn on the light to look around for bottles or cans of soda. She'll control the amount of dishes I have in my room almost daily, even though my sister harbors half of our kitchen in her room and she doesn't give a fuck for a month. She will compare our waists, this woman is like 80kg and had 4 kids and will say \"haha but my waist isn't that much bigger than yours\" mum are you fucking stupid? What is this, reverse body dysmorphia??\n\nI feel like she's just using me for self gratification because she thinks I'm so resilient to everything. I know my mum, and I know that this isn't coming from a place of concern for me. I really know, trust me. It's a lowkey kind of behaviour, but at the same time, it isn't. It's like she's vicariously living through me and trying to make me fatter so she's smaller in comparison. I feel so used and watched and it's fucking killing me. It reminds me so much of my dad, because I wasn't his child, I was merely a subject of projection for his feelings towards himself and his mother. And now I'm right back in that boat.\n\nShe's just triggering the SHIT out of me, I know that her waist is double my size but it's just making my body dysmorphia going crazy. And the more she watches me, the less I want her to see me eat. And restricting right now almost feels easy. I was doing so well and I'm so fucking angry and scared. I can't tell her either because then I'll be EXTRA on the watch. Who the fuck does she think she is.\n\nI'm sorry. My boyfriend knows all about this, but I want to scream this out to people who're going through something similar. I'm so fucking sorry.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

{"post_id": "c3sgb2", "created_utc": 1561224769, "title": "Why do we feel like we have to do our eating disorders \"right?\"", "author": "clarelandis", "self_text": "My friend said she feels like she has to do her eating disorder all the way. That might sound insignificant to someone who hasn\u2019t struggled with an eating disorder, but I got goosebumps when I heard her say it because I felt that way and had just never verbalized it. She went on and explained: it\u2019s like there are two options in your head, you feel like you can either be successful at your disorder or be successful at life. It\u2019s really hard to be successful in life. It\u2019s uncertain, it\u2019s scary, you can\u2019t control all the pieces. It is also hard to be successful in your eating disorder; it is challenging to deprive yourself of food, force yourself to throw up, and hurt yourself in other ways. But, when that success in life isn\u2019t working out, it feels like you have another option. There is another way to feel that same success. And, believe me, that eating disorder can give a great false sense of success. It doesn\u2019t make sense, but that drive for success is so strong, and doing \u201cwell\u201d in your eating disorder actually does feel like an accomplishment which is one of the things that makes eating disorders so evil. \n\nThe success from the disorder really resonated with me, and I\u2019m sure it does with a lot of people since eating disorders do have some perfectionistic qualities. It also brought up a similar thought I\u2019d been struggling with: that I needed to do my eating disorder right so I could move on. From October through December of last year, I was tormented by that thought. I was obsessed with doing my disorder right, I literally dreamed about it every night; there was no escaping it. If I could do my eating disorder right, then I could move on with my life. I thought it would be possible to really get rid of it if I could appease the monster just once. So, that\u2019s what I tried to do. I started acting on behaviors like crazy and drove myself deep into the disorder. My disorder that had been mostly chronic in the past suddenly became much more acute. I thought if I could do it \u201cright,\u201d then the disorder would relinquish control of me. And by some external standards, I did do my disorder \u201cright.\u201d I ended up with a tube, being lectured about organ failure, and had to go back to treatment for the millionth time after I got out of the hospital. \n\nBut, it still wasn\u2019t enough for my disorder to be satisfied. Even though I almost died, I hadn\u2019t gone far enough. I was still a failure. The only time you can satisfy the disorder is if you\u2019re dead, and I couldn\u2019t see it at the time. I thought if I just took it a little further I could be done for good. It was to the point where I was turning off my kangaroo pump when no one was looking just so I could avoid a few more calories. I was so angry at myself for not losing enough weight even though I had lost weight so quickly that my body was shutting down. I was angry at myself for eating one meal so I could be stable enough for the flight to treatment. I had failed yet again at being anorexic, so I couldn\u2019t let go of the disorder. I genuinely thought this would be the last time I did anything disordered, and I could get rid of it for good. \n\nIt\u2019s like playing a game with a referee who always changes their mind. At first, doing x things will keep you in the game and keep you on the winning team. Then, you have to do x and restrict a little more to stay winning. Then, you have to over-exercise or start purging too. Then, you have to eat no more than a tiny number of calories in a day. It just keeps going. And the worst part is, you trust this referee. This referee is a part of you, and every time they change the rules, you genuinely believe these are the new rules of the game. That if you follow the new rules, you can eventually win and stop playing. What is hard to understand about this game is that you can\u2019t win it. You can die for it, but that\u2019s the closest you can come to winning. \n\nSo, to my people who are struggling: get out of the game. I know it feels like you can win, but you can\u2019t. It\u2019s impossible. That referee will never be satisfied. So, beat them up. Get a red card, and get kicked out of the game for good. It\u2019s not that easy and a red card won\u2019t fix it. But, getting out of the game is better than staying in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://thiscrazybeautifullife.home.blog/2019/06/19/do-it-right/](https://thiscrazybeautifullife.home.blog/2019/06/19/do-it-right/)", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I was also terrified that if I did purge that it would send me into a b/p cycle that would last days and I just don\u2019t want that!

I'm F19 and have always been a pretty skinny kid. I was healthy, only ate when needed, I had so much energy. From literal birth until I was about 10, I lived with my father in a moldy house where he got drunk and hit me and my siblings every night. My mom got custody of us in 2010, and that's when things changed. Mentally, I felt amazing. I didn't have to lay in bed worried my dad would come in to hit me everynight and I didn't have a care in the world. When I started at my new school in 5th grade, I was bullied so horribly I had to move schools in a new town the next year. Before that, in my old school when I lived with my dad (in a different state), I acted so weird and different because of my home life, the bullying was the same. At my new school, I still got bullied but I made amazing friends who I still hang out with (we graduated in 2018). Everything was still okay mentally, but around seventh grade was when things started changing. I started having nightmares of my childhood and was extremely depressed. I started selfharming in eighth grade and was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and a severe case of obsessive compulsive disorder (which has not changed). Along with selfharming, I turned to eating. Any chance I got, I ate. I still do, and it's horrendous (I am almost a year clean from selfharm, though!). I was a good 115 lbs, healthy 5\"4 girl before highschool, and now I'm over 220 lbs, same height, one year after graduating. I eat until I feel sick, I can barely run or do anything without getting out of breath. And no part of me can stop. It's like my mind is forcing me to buy and shove unhealthy shit in my mouth until I can't breathe because I am so full. I'll cry while doing it sometimes but it doesn't change anything. I am so unhealthy and I hate my body image with a burning passion, but I can't get myself up to do anything about it. I am a good artist, singer, and used to do everything I loved but I don't even have the motivation to sketch a simple picture anymore. It's not as easy as getting up and dieting and exercising and my family, especially my sister (year younger than me) put me down for it. She is so rude about it, saying it's not an eating disorder and I'm just lazy. I don't want to be lazy. I want to be healthy, and I don't know where this eat-your-feelings-due-to-childhood-trauma thing came from. I have never gotten to just say everything, and I figured this is a chance I can vent my feelings and ask for help. Any personal experiences, advice from people who are going through similar things. I just need something to jumpstart this out of me. I hope this wasn't annoying, it felt good to just type it out. I hate myself and I don't know what to do. I am currently living with my boyfriend of two years, and he is the love of my life. He loves me for me and understands how I feel, and he is my only support. I would love to find a doctor to work with but I cannot afford that, so I'll just start with this. Thank you for anything.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I\u2019ve had a very unhealthy relationship with food probably my entire life. From going up and down to very low weight to veryyyy high weight my teenage years and more recently, I\u2019m 21 right now and finally starting to make a long term commitment to eating right and exercising in a healthy way. I\u2019ve lost about 50 pounds and only 30 away from my goal! This being said, I have to make a conscious effort to make sure I have a decent relationship with food, but I will never ever be like a normal person who can have a whole and healthy relationship with it that doesn\u2019t come with fear and hatred towards food. But that\u2019s fine, I\u2019ve accepted that and I\u2019m coping with it. I\u2019ve found what works for me and I\u2019m practicing that. That is not the problem here tho. Since I associate bad food with bad feelings for me I have this horrible nasty habit of judging anyone who is over weight for eating bad foods. I hate it and I feel disgusting for even admitting this. I am ALL about body positivity and any size being beautiful. I follow all body positive accounts and preach about size inclusivity/ body confidence/ self love. I truly believe in it! And I strive to have a mindset where I don\u2019t hyper analyze and judge others. In the (far) future when I have a daughter I want her to have a relationship with food that I didn\u2019t have. I try not to but sometimes in public I\u2019ll unintentionally shame (of course to myself) anyone over weight for eating badly. I have a few overweight friends and seeing their food choices/fridge etc the first thing that comes to my mind is a judging sort of thought process followed by me yelling at myself like \u201cstop it! It\u2019s their body and you\u2019re only projecting on to other people who do not have a bad relationship with food.\u201d Even if they\u2019re over weight, they eat pretty normal for the most part but occasionally will have some junk. And that\u2019s normal!!!?? So why is my subconscious always pointing this out to me as bad? I can probably answer my own question by saying it\u2019s my self projecting my own negative feelings on to others and I want this to stop so bad. I truly and genuinely believe at any size if you have confidence and self love you have a glow that makes you beautiful. I just don\u2019t know why food triggers something in my head! I hope nobody takes this the wrong way because i so desperately want to stop and have made conscious attempts not to. I know it\u2019s my own fault and has nothing to do with these people. Side note, growing up my mom ALWAYS makes comments on what her and everyone around her is eating, so maybe it\u2019s just engraved in my brain?

That\u2019s 15 fucking years of hating my body, hating myself, losing weight/gaining weight, treatment centers, hospital visits, sleepless nights, impulsive decisions, anxiety, depression, ocd, psychiatrists, therapists and so much more. I\u2019ve been to over 15 treatment centers in 15 years and have created a habit of running away whenever things have gotten hard.  Its been 15 years of looking for love in all the wrong places, trying to find forever in temporary people and neglecting the most important source of love... which is within me.  My eating disorder has manifested itself through anorexia, bulimia and binge eating. Ive never really known a life separate from my ED. Ive found healing through yoga over the years and truly believe that its my calling, but my number one priority has always been my ED. \n\nLast October I decided that I wanted to go to India for a yoga training and knew something had to change. I was taking phentermine to lose weight, i was on klonopin for 11 years to help with focal point seizures and ambien for 11 years for insomnia.\n\nI was having manic episodes and knew the only way id be able to move forward was coming off of the meds. \nNaively, I decided to stop cold turkey and experienced the worst pain of my life. I was having seizures, memory loss, body aches, agoraphobia to name a few. I came close to death but I never gave up.\n\nI decided to taper off of the klonopin and experienced a grueling 8 months of withdrawal symptoms.\nI knew I needed to finally deal with my eating disorder but felt defeated. I woke up every day wishing i was dead and went to sleep wishing I would never wake up.\n\nMay 10th I decided that I wanted to live. I decided to get help and to most importantly, take it seriously. I had hit rock bottom and surrendered my life to an eating disorder treatment center in Carlsbad California.\n\nIt\u2019s been over 6 weeks and I finally feel myself changing. There is sight of a light at the end of the tunnel that I thought i would never make it out of.  I feel a step closer to the liberation that I\u2019ve dreamed about for 15 years. I\u2019m 42 days off of the klonopin that i was convinced i would never get off of. Im coming to peace with my weight and no longer pending my happiness on calories. I plan on finally making that trip to India and Bali next year just in time for my 30th birthday, which I never thought I\u2019d live to see. My life is changing in a way I never thought possible. Im hopeful.. im grateful.. and everyday I\u2019m one step closer to loving myself.\n\nIf you\u2019re fighting that never ending battle in your own mind, DO NOT GIVE UP. There is a light on the other side, i promise. \n\nto be continued \u270c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude43", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

But I\u2019m an adult. If I want to eat a little more on a Friday with my BF, then dammit I will. Go me. I ended up eating 3000 calories for the day. And tbh I wasn\u2019t that shaken up by it. \n\nSaturday I listened to my body. Listened to the hunger and fullness signals. Well to the best of my ability. And surprise, surprise, I only needed 1600 calories and I felt good about it. I didn\u2019t feel like I was restricting. I simply just wasn\u2019t very hungry, probably because of the amount from the day before. This is how a normal person eats, is it not? Go me. Much excite. Are we really doing this and being successful?!\n\nNope! Enter Sunday. I feel hungry basically all day. I woke up hungry. So I ate a decent sized breakfast. Heck some might even call it large. Bagel with PB and a banana and a protein shake in coffee. Come lunch, I wasn\u2019t super hungry but I was feeling a need to eat. So I had a serving and a half of cereal. Dinner time. I have like 1000 calories left of my 2200 budget. Have a PB and banana sandwich. Right after that I still feel hungry but decide to take some time and see if it really is hunger. For THREE FREAKING HOURS I am consumed with food thoughts. I have a serving of popcorn (as I\u2019m writing this I see where I went wrong) to see if that signals to my brain we are done eating. NOPE. Well now that was a waste of calories. I tell my BF how I\u2019m struggling. \n\nInternal monologue that I voice to BF: it\u2019s 8 PM and I don\u2019t feel like I should eat anymore today because it is late and I don\u2019t need fuel for anything. Plus I don\u2019t really know if I AM hungry or if I just want to \u201cspend the calories I have left\u201d. If I eat, and I\u2019m not actually hungry, then I\u2019m over eating. If I don\u2019t eat and I am hungry, then I am restricting. I just don\u2019t know. \n\nBF convinces me that I should eat. If I\u2019ve been obsessing about food for three hours, then I\u2019m hungry. Whether he is correct or not, I decide to take his advice. I have some yogurt with some jello cheesecake powder and PB powder mixed in to make it like PB cheesecake. It\u2019s less than 200 calories and brings me to 2000 for the day. NO BIG DEAL. My allotment is 2200. \n\nAND YET I COULDN\u2019T EAT IT. FUCKFyicdhb. I took a bite and it wasn\u2019t amazing. But I told myself this is my ED fighting me now, I must persevere. I ate a couple more bites and then was just stuck. Just sitting on the couch staring at the bowl. Internal struggle and dilemma. If I was really hungry, it wouldn\u2019t matter if this wasn\u2019t delicious. Since the taste matters, I guess I\u2019m not hungry. Do I keep eating? ED voice won. When BF left the room, I scooped most of it out and down the sink. I left 2 bites in the bowl so he could see if he came back in a short time. He didn\u2019t. I took one more bite and then put the bowl in the sink and filled it up with water. \n\nUgh. What is normal eating anyways?\n\nAlso, I know I need to stop counting calories.

For the longest time, I've correlated the smallness of my body with my attractiveness. I was never overweight, but it wasn't until I was underweight that men suddenly seemed interested in me. A lot of people I've been with bring up my size as something they find attractive about me (i.e. \"You're the smallest girl I've ever been with\" \"You're so petite, it's so cute.\" I literally had a random guy hit me up on the street with the opening line of \"Wow, I just wanted to say that I love how small you are!\"...wtf).\n\nFor about the past year I've had a friends with benefits. We've had a positive relationship and for the most part, his comments on the way I look don't revolve around my weight or size, which is a nice change. However, the first time we slept together, back when my BMI was under 16, he did mention that I had \"a great body\", and the last time we slept together back in May, after I had gained a lot of weight, he offhandedly asked if my ass had gotten bigger. I don't think he meant anything by it but it really shook me and made me feel bad about myself.\n\nHe's been out of the state for the past month and a half for an internship but he's coming back to visit in July and I'm so worried I won't even have the strength to go see him--he works out a lot and is in great shape. Whereas my BMI is closer to 19 now, but it looks like so much more than that on my short and small frame. My butt and thighs are covered in cellulite even though I'm not overweight and my body looks so gross and out of shape. I'm afraid he'll be as disgusted by my new body as I am. I'm not sure I could even be intimate with someone at this weight.\n\nTl;dr: how have you guys worked on overcoming intimacy issues while undergoing weight gain? I only ever seem to enjoy it when I feel thin enough.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

How it's basically a mini ecosystem in our gut and how it can affect us drastically. Hence why those who are deep in their ED are more likely to be depressed and anxious because the microbiomes aren't getting what they need thus cannot perform effectively.\n\nI know it isn't easy to recovery, but this is one of the things that has helped me view food differently and kinda open my eyes a little. \n\nHope this helps.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

{"post_id": "c51079", "created_utc": 1561430208, "title": "My experience with an ED", "author": "Sal4Sale", "self_text": "For a quick reference, I\u2019m a guy, I feel like this is important in my experience. I think the first time I started exhibiting behavior indicative of an ED was in middle school when I stopped eating lunch, I was never overweight, I think I was 130 in 6th grade when this all began, I remember being disgusted and began restricting myself. When I stopped eating lunch my teachers assumed I was trying to be a typical defiant teen, so I was put in \u201clunch detention\u201d and given other punishments, which in turn reinforced the behavior rather than stopping it. Instead, I ate lunch and skipped breakfast and most of dinner instead, since my school didn\u2019t see any problems, my parents didn\u2019t either.\n\nIn seventh grade I became severely depressed as a result of my mom being diagnosed with breast cancer, and I took it out in myself heavily, I stopped taking care of myself, I lost sleep, cut contact with close friends and my body was beginning to react to the restrictive behavior. In eighth grade I started volunteering at a fire company, which pushed me to recover a bit, but after getting into high school things went back to where they were. 2018 was a fucking nightmare.\n\nThat summer I would have days that I would take in under 200 calories, since I didn\u2019t have school lunches keeping me going. My parents still didn\u2019t really take notice until I joined one of those ridiculous \u2018youth military\u2019 things that still make me cringe (like jrotc), I literally could not keep up with 9 year olds, in my first week my commander (still not even sure what we called her, I wasn\u2019t there long) noticed I wasn\u2019t eating at all and offered me oatmeal at every meetup, which I refused every time. Eventually one of the other guys, an older gentleman who I shall respectfully refer to as Sgt. Dickhead, began to ridicule me because \u201cguys can\u2019t be anorexic.\u201d\n\nSgt. Dickhead also had a grandson (or maybe a son, like I said, wasn\u2019t there long), who he claimed ate 5000 calories a day and worked it all off, I still remember him asking me in the hallway if this if who I wanted to be (referring to his gson). And I absolutely fucking did not. So my other commander, the one who offered oatmeal, actually sat me down and talked to me about my disorder, like an actual human being and not a former marine talking to literal children like they\u2019re soldiers. It was humanizing, because I only really knew her to be the typical marine, loud and mean, like they\u2019re supposed to be. I left that week and went to a summer camp that I signed up for, for the sake of privacy I\u2019ll just say it was a police oriented summer camp (oh yes I was that popular). It kind of resembled those scared straight camps or whatever, but it was aimed at kids who wanted a career in law enforcement.\n\nAt this summer camp I was even more miserable, because now instead of veterans screaming at me I had off duty state police officers yelling at me with actual anger. They spent the first day breaking us in like we just got to Paris Island, one specifically called out my weight which got me going, I didn\u2019t yell back but it kept me up that night. That entire week was like that, except now I was incentivized to take bad care of myself. We were allowed one minute showers, precise meal times (not like that really mattered to me) and a strict curfew, the first night they pulled a fire drill and we only got about a few hours of sleep (they didn\u2019t let us have watches so I have no idea how long this was, also this is unrelated but we weren\u2019t allowed any technology, so we weren\u2019t up on current events and while this camp was going on Trump was meeting with North Korea. So we were all terrified we were about to be nuked the entire week).\n\nWhen I left, I wanted nothing to do with the military or the police, as I previously wanted to pursue a career in one or the other. Ultimately, I decided I wanted to get into healthcare because the nurses they had on staff were the only two people who weren\u2019t complete dicks. So I started to prepare to take an EMT course and become an EMT (in my state you can receive certification at 16). The one thing I wanted to do was help people like me, I never visited a shrink or doctor about my ED, so I was waiting for the day my heart stopped being able to take it, or just something else that was a byproduct of the disorder happened to me, and I knew with my experience I would be able to talk to these people and maybe make a change, and that\u2019s exactly what I did. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to abandon firefighting (mostly because it\u2019s an amazing adrenaline trip), so I kept taking courses for that, but focused on my EMT stuff. I took five months off for the class, and in that time I made changes in my life, small ones, but enough to snowball later on, that slowly led to my recovering process.\n\nHere I am now, an EMT in my home state about to start my next fire class, and I just had pizza with my family, something I would have very well shot myself for doing last year. My last relapse was about a week ago, I think I can do this. I\u2019ve been to a ton of internet ED pages over this time, I\u2019ve only been here for a bit, and love to see other people having victories in their own lives, so here\u2019s mine. I hope this helps somebody on here, I know it won\u2019t cure you in a day, but I hope it lets you know that it gets better, and it does.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I've never done coaching before, but I feel like over the phone is a kind of impersonal way to do it - you can't see the person, you can't really emotionally connect with them, it feels sort of stilted. But, she asked a lot of good questions and challenged my beliefs and I wanted to share the notes I took with you.\n\nI explained to her that growing up I learned to associate foods with very emotional things. Rewards, special occasions, family gatherings, sadness. I never ate for sustenance or just when hungry. I've lost weight and done it in a healthy way, but I haven't changed my eating habits or fixed my relationship with food, which feels all-consuming. \n\nI sabotage myself. I can identify I'm not hungry and say to myself \"you aren't hungry\" - and I'll eat anyway for the comfort, or the rush, or the release of stress. Or I'll say/think, \"[this food] won't matter, I'm fat anyway\" as justification to eat it. \n\n* My thoughts revolve around food almost all the time. I'm constantly thinking about food - what I'll eat, what I want to eat, why I shouldn't eat that, etc. She said right now, I'm consumed by desire that's hard to manage, and I'm using food to ease my feelings. But I need to learn that food isn't evil, and I can't let it control me (easier said than done).\n* Me thinking it \"won't make a difference\" is sabotage. It ALWAYS makes a difference. If I didn't eat something or didn't binge, it would make a difference. Eating/binging is habit, and every time I give in, it strengthens my habit to eat them. Why even have a little bit?\n* Justifications to eat/binge are lies you tell yourself. Justifications make guilt.\n* If you say \"no\" to eating/snacking/binging, you have to feel whatever you were trying to feel better from. If you're feeling desire and you don't eat, you feel unwanted desire. Be okay with feeling emotional discomfort. If you say no - feel uncomfortable.\n* I asked if she thought feeling the feelings or distracting yourself was better. She asked, \"what do you think?\" I said: it would be easier to distract yourself, but it's probably better to feel the feelings and work through it. Distractions don't always work, and it doesn't fix the underlying feeling. Eating is a form of distractions - it distracts but doesn't fix.\n* Feeling feelings is the hard part. Be comfortable with being uncomfortable. Right now, I don't know how to deal with feeling stressed or sad or hopeless or just dealing with the desire for food. But oddly enough, I deal with my anxiety very well. I told her how I get waves of anxiety sometimes, and how I've learned to stop and breathe and trace back my thoughts: WHY do I feel anxious? WHAT do I feel anxious about? Is the thing I'm feeling anxious about fixable - or can I do something about it? If so, how do I do it? (I make a plan.) If not, why am I worrying about something I can't change? ... I need to learn how to apply this method to other parts of my life. \n* Next step after facing my feelings is to shift my mindset. Food is not a permanent cure for desire. I need to believe food can just be enjoyable, without consuming my life. It's not evil. \n* She asked me at the end if I believe I'm strong, smart, and capable. About this? I was like, \"I think I can be.\" She said: \"No, ARE you strong in other parts of your life? Are you smart? Are you capable? ... You have those qualities, you just need to put them into THIS skillset. The EATING skillset, and learning to eat right.\"", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

A lot of them seem to have one common denominator -- they choose a kind of belief system that is simple.... let me explain.\n\nFor lots of binge eaters, everything is confusing and there are lots of unhealthy thoughts to sift through. So I see lots of people choose a direct food-related route; they choose to go vegan, keto, paleo, do IF, calorie counting, etc. It definitely doesn't work for many but if it does, it's because they chose a rule that is \"simple\" (not to be confused with \"easy\"). And by 'simple' I mean something that has clear yes-or-no answers, such as: is it time to fast? yes? then don't eat. or: is it keto-friendly? yes? then eat it. You get the idea.\n\nThere are also people who approach it from a non-food sort of way. The most popular way I've noticed is the Brain Over Binge method. This method also does a kind of simple rule/belief system. I may get this wrong since I don't necessarily follow it, but I think it's something like \"do I actually want to eat it or is it an intrusive thought?\" ... so basically it also does the black and white thinking.\n\nPersonally, my black and white thinking is: \"am I actually hungry? yes --&gt; eat, no--&gt; drink tea\" (I use tea as a replacement for the *action* for eating).\n\nIn short, people select one rule for simplicity and essentially believe that if they follow that, it will help them manage their urges.\n\nBut ----\n\nThere are also people who don't do this whole simple belief rule. I feel like this method is the best for long-term because it targets each thought from a logical standpoint and doesn't just hyperfocus on one thing. However, it is the most difficult. I see posts on here where they go through their therapist and target each unreasonable thought and fully understand when to not listen to the intrusive thought. But also, I believe the above methods (simple-rule thinking) can maybe merge into this method over time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, this is just my theory.

My lowest BMI was 18, but my doctors gave up on me because of my refusal to accept help. I had all the help in the world.

So I had been on a great recovery path the last couple weeks, after struggling the last few months on a serious relapse.

I am also a type two diabetic, so one fine day I was in the break room minding my own damn business, checking my blood sugar and one of my coworkers who I had previously had a crush on walked in. \n\nHe said to me, \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know you were a diabetic, RedMakeupBag98\u201d.

Losing weight. You should try it.\u201d And then he just walked out of the room.\n\nI was super shocked, and I just immediately burst into tears. Thankfully there was no one else in the break room. I was at my highest weight at the time, and I immediately started to feel like absolute garbage about myself. That was the day I started to fall back into my old patterns of restricting. Before that, even though I was at my highest weight I was starting to feel good about myself, and if I was going to lose weight, I wanted to do it at my own pace and in a healthy manner. That\u2019s not what ended up happening. After that, I started working on another unit so I didn\u2019t see him for a few months. I just saw him yesterday after not having seen him for a while, and I lost a substantial amount of weight from the last time he saw me, so I could tell that he noticed. He kept trying to talk to me, and it just made me upset. My coworkers were noticing that there was tension, and they asked me what was up so I told them. In hindsight, that was probably a mistake. Once I brought it up, it was really hard for me to stop thinking about it. Now it feels like I really can\u2019t stop thinking about it, and I\u2019m back on my old unit so it\u2019s going to be a trigger every time I have to see him and work with him.

I feel like I'm so isolated in life and forced to endure this constant urge. I can see people observing my weight gain with disgust and I watch people laugh at me and feel like shit. I'm very ashamed of what I've done the past week. I want to look good for my girlfriend and just in general and feel like I've let her down and myself down. I truly am just ashamed and want to change. Today will hopefully be my first day without a binge in a long time.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

In fact, I'm still down that path. But I wanted to pass on some thoughts in case anyone else was struggling like I was for years.\n\nI lost weight very easily the first time around. 30 pounds in 6 months, so pretty healthily too. It careened into a spiral after the initial 30lbs, though. My depression and anxiety flared up like a bad bout of acne. I started binging and restricting, then binging and purging, exercise and otherwise. Then, I just started binging.\n\nThat spiralled upwards until I was at my original starting weight. I attempted to restrict to lose weight and it would work for a couple of weeks before stalling for *months*. I binged to make myself feel better and gained back any weight I'd lost.\n\nI couldn't get out of the 120s for literally a year. I'd dip down to the teens with heavy restriction, but I'd never hit the 100s, and I'd always jump right back up to the 120s.\n\nAnd I was hungry. All. The. Time.\n\nI didn't know what the fuck was wrong with me. I thought I'd broken my body by being underweight for half a year. I was tracking religiously, but not seeing results for months.\n\nIn the end, something my mom said lit a bulb over my head. She mentioned my sister's hypothyroidism, and how she kept waking up too late to eat breakfast because she had to take a pill an hour before eating. I thought about it: my mom has hypothyroidism, and so does my sister. Odds were, I could have it too.\n\nI'd never paid any mind to the laundry list of medication my mom or my sister had to take. So the only thing I'd heard of hypothyroidism was the excuses from FAs on /r/fatlogic posts. \n\nBut, it explained my inability to lose the 15-20 pounds I'd put on from my \"normal\" weight.\n\nIt explained my sluggishness, feeling cold all the time, my (tmi) constipation, my thin hair, etc. A lot of those I'd initially put down to being underweight. But they persisted, even at a normal weight.\n\nFinally, I bit the bullet and got a blood test done with my doctor.\n\nI have hypothyroidism. My metabolism had slowed to a crawl. My BMR likely might've been in the 1000 kcals range. Now, I have to take Synthroid every day for the rest of my life. But you know what? It's worth it. \n\nI wake up feeling rested. I'm not depressed all the damn time. I'm able to regulate my weight without restricting. I eat normal portions and I don't feel hungry all the damn time.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's not a cure-all. I still have thoughts about restricting when stressed and anxious, but I'm less anxious overall. I do worry about my weight sometimes, but not enough to make an impact on my mental health. It might be a mix of recovery and taking medication for my hypothyroidism, but the medication gives me a sense of relief because my metabolism is no longer broken.\n\nThis turned out into quite an essay, but if it helps someone - anyone - then I'm glad to have typed it out.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

It also has the potential to go nowhere, as they often consider creating various positions and then decide against it, but in any case this is the most viable opportunity I have at the moment.\n\nMy boss knows about my ED history but not that I\u2019m relapsing, but she has definitely noticed that I\u2019ve lost weight. So she keeps feeding me. Every day she\u2019ll put some of her lunch on my desk, and she grabs stuff out of the kitchen for me when there\u2019s something she knows I\u2019d like. And I eat whatever she gives me. Honestly, it feels nice to be taken care of like that. The fact that someone actually gives a shit about me almost feels like I have permission to eat, like as long as it\u2019s something she has given to me the calories don\u2019t count and I\u2019m allowed to eat it.\n\nThen when I get home I end up having to debate with myself whether or not I should have dinner. The food my boss gave me doesn\u2019t \u201ccount\u201d so I am \u201callowed\u201d to eat. But still, I ate at work so do I really need to eat now too? And round and round it goes.\n\nThe problem I have now is I\u2019m not sure what to do about my weight. I definitely don\u2019t want to gain, and I am so happy when the number on the scale finally goes down (however slowly it may be going at this point, every .2 lb loss makes me giddy). But I don\u2019t want losing weight to fuck up a potential job opportunity, especially since I really doubt my ability to be able to land a decent job on my own. I think the other people in the office are a bit freaked out by my weight. But at least if I maintain and keep eating in front of them, it hopefully won\u2019t be seen as a problem. But if I keep losing weight, it\u2019ll be pretty damn clear that there\u2019s an issue. And who\u2019s going to want to hire someone who is clearly ill? I\u2019ll be seen as a liability, as someone who won\u2019t be able to do this job long term. \n\nSo I should work on maintaining, right? Only what if the owner decides against creating the salaried position at all? Then I\u2019ll have wasted however many weeks maintaining when I could have been losing, and it will all have been for nothing. So I should just keep losing, right?\n\nI wish I could just decide on a course of action and stick to it, but noooo. Of course I can\u2019t. Instead I restrict for a few days telling myself that I\u2019m not going to be hired anyway so I should just keep focusing on my ED goals. Then I think about what an amazing career opportunity this is and how perfect it would be if they did decide to hire me on a permanent basis, and I spend a few days trying to stuff my face to keep my weight from dropping and sabotaging my chances at getting this job. Then a few days later I\u2019m back to being convinced that it will never become anything more than a short term project and then I have to restrict more to make up for my maintenance days. And all this while second guessing myself on whether or not it\u2019s really okay for me to be eating the food my boss gives me, or if I\u2019m just using that as an excuse to be a weak gluttonous pig.\n\nAll of this back and forth is just driving me insane. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m doing about food anymore. I stopped at the grocery store after work last night just to get some fruit and veg, and ended up spending close to an hour wandering around looking at pretty much every item in the store. I kept grabbing stuff and putting it back and then grabbing it again because I don\u2019t even know what the plan is. Grab a jar of pb because hey that\u2019s a quick and easy way to up my intake. But wait\u2014 is that what I\u2019ve decided to do? Five minutes ago I scolded myself for even looking at a container of guac because I need to stay under x amount of calories to get my weight down and guac is just fucking unnecessary. So what am I doing here? What the hell am I supposed to buy, what am I supposed to eat, how much, when? Am I counting work calories or not? Am I eating at work instead of eating at home, or in addition to eating at home?\n\nAnd all of those questions are the reason I didn\u2019t get home til after 9:00 last night, with two bags of groceries\u2014 one full of fruit and veg, and the other full of absolute crap.\n\nSo I guess my point is...help!?!", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I spent two weeks in a binge, and the last week purging to get back on track. I feel awful and I just want to start losing again.

I have two brands, but they both say you take the pills before a meal\u2014what if I don\u2019t want to eat? Has anyone ever used diet pills to prolong a fast or prevent eating, rather than just minimize it? Have you taken diet pills without eating? What happened? \n\nI\u2019m also open to just hearing others\u2019 experiences with OTC diet pills... I\u2019m really nervous, but at this point I\u2019m purging 2-3x a day (not after a binge\u2014after ANY meal) and I just want it to stop. I figure the best way to do that is to not eat in the first place. Which sounds awful, I know, but sometimes when you can\u2019t completely stop the damage, you try to at least reduce it.

I basically get off on people telling me I look too thin, look like I lost weight, look like I have an eating disorder etc. when I don\u2019t hear it for long periods of time my mind goes crazy.\n\nMy old dietitian, who maybe I\u2019ll work w again when I\u2019m rdy idk, ALWAYS used to tell me how thin I was. Every week she would be like wow you look like you\u2019re down, you\u2019re way too thin etc. when I would go prolonged periods without seeing her she always was like, \u201cI always forget how thin you are it doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d Etc. I lived for her comments. - looking back, maybe not the best thing for an ED professional to be saying to someone w an ED but whateve! \n\nI also ride horses, I haven\u2019t taken lessons w my old instructor for about 2 years because I\u2019m really riding for pleasure now, not showing or whatever (expensive!) but every time I had a lesson, she always would comment on my weight and how thin I was, call me \u201cms. Eating disorder\u201d etc. One time I was tagged in a post eating pizza w my friends, and she comments and was like \u201cI swear whenever you actually do eat, it\u2019s pizza.\u201d It was just so validating.\n\nI also get it at my job (work in fashion), when a client I haven\u2019t seen in a while comes in, they normally tell me how skinny in looking, or an old coworker sees me, whatever. But these moments are far and few. My friends at this point know not to comment on my weight, because I never take it the right way, whether I\u2019m up or down. Other people in my life do make comments when I haven\u2019t seen them in a while, but it\u2019s the whole thing, \u201cawhile\u201d is too long for me. \n\nSo I\u2019m not regularly getting comments about my weight, (not seeing dietitian/riding instructor), the most my therapist says is just asks if I am eating. I miss my dietitian  and my instructor so much because they actively fed the part of my brain that wanted this validation. Idk if I even really liked them as people, but my ED loved hearing that I looked like I had an eating disorder. \n\nAnyone else just get off on this type of validation and surround yourselves with people that will give it to you?

Its just denial.\n\nEdit: watched the rest of the story. It shows her working out with the quote \"exercise does not equal weight loss\" well if you're eating more calories than her not even half assed workout, you're right. Her workout just looks like she doesn't want to try at all. It's lethargic. \n\nI guess now I'm motivated to go exercise better than her? Idk that whole snap story made me feel weird.

My parents (currently live with my dad, but grew up with my mom) have no idea about the eating disorder or that I\u2019ve been seeing any doctors for treatment (I usually just lie and say I\u2019m going to a class, since I\u2019m in college). \n\nMy eating disorder was a lot more severe, I think, when I was in middle school and high school and my parents never noticed or did anything.

This combined with his complaints about his weight, and frequent bathroom trips made me start to wonder.\n\nOne night we went out to dinner and I used the bathroom after him, only to see residue from the me he has just eaten in the bathroom sink. On other occasions he claimed he had eaten too much and wasn\u2019t feeling well and would head for the bathroom. Finally, one night I was waiting for him to come back from the bathroom and when he kissed me he just reeked of vomit, so I flat out asked him if he throws up his food. He denied it, but several weeks later admitted to me that he was, in fact, bulimic and throws up after every single meal.\n\nHe told me that no one else in his life had ever noticed(ex gfs family etc) and that if anything they just thought he sometimes ate too much and felt sick. Anyways, that was about 8 months ago and now we\u2019ve had open conversations about his eating disorder. He gets very emotional when the topic comes up, and apparently this is something that\u2019s been going on for about 5 years, but to be honest I\u2019m not certain if he\u2019s being truthful with me.\n\nI have tried giving him information about the permanent damage he is doing to his body. I\u2019ve tried talking to him and being open and understanding, I\u2019ve tried distracting him after meals to keep his mind off of purging. Nothing seems to help, and I realize that I have no concept of how he is feeling or how deeply seeded his struggle with this is. I love him very much and want to help him because I see how much he struggles with this every day. He is always asking if he looks fat, saying he hates himself and hates his body.\n\nI just want to help him, but I feel like he is partially in denial. He\u2019s told me the last time he visited the doctor/dentist they told him he is perfectly healthy but I know there are lifelong harmful affects caused by bulimia. His eating disorder is slowly robbing him of his life and it\u2019s eroding our relationship as well as he is always more focused on himself/food/how he looks or feels more than anything else.\n\nCan anyone please give me some advice here, I feel incredible guilty for not doing more as I\u2019m the only one who knows about this?

BUT, on monday and tuesday i had cramps and my boobs were slightly sore, my acne has gotten strangely bad, etc. i\u2019ve had period symptoms and still not gotten my period before so i didn\u2019t want to jinx anything. but today when i got home from therapy, where i JUST talked about how concerned i was about my period not coming, there it was!!! i am genuinely so overwhelmed even though it\u2019s really light and probably won\u2019t last long, but i cannot stop crying. i feel so validated in all the healthy things i was doing better, and this really reminded me why i was doing it in the first place. this is exactly what i needed to keep fighting. i WANT the cramps and the bloating, i just want to feel like a fucking woman, like i could possibly have a normal life someday. the fact that i was trying so hard to eat more and not restrict and exercise less and i STILL wasn\u2019t getting my period was really discouraging, and another reason relapsing was such an appeal/didn\u2019t feel like a huge deal. but this IS a huge deal. i am so fucking grateful and filled with hope. i hope someone else sees this and it inspires them to keep fighting. don\u2019t let your brain tell you recovery isn\u2019t worth it. don\u2019t let yourself get fooled today. even if it doesn\u2019t seem like it right now, that snack you decide to eat, that run you decide to not go on, those all mean something. keep fighting everyone, you all deserve recovery.

It had first hand accounts from his friends talking about how he gained so much weight toward the end and what he would eat (a lot basically). \n\nIt also talked about how conscious he was of his weight gain and his attempts to restrict in order to lose weight. He did not like the media calling him fat, and I cannot blame him. At one point he went on a diet where he consumed only 500 calories per day. Yikes. I'm not saying Elvis had binge eating disorder, but he was clearly affected by binge and restrict cycles\n\nI read up on the subject after watching the documentary and I read that binge eating was a constant in Elvis' life. I saw a few interviews he did in the '50s that talked about how much he liked to eat.  Cheeseburgers and Cokes! Elvis loved breakfast!  Awwww!\n\nI can't stop thinking about that. When you're thin, binge eating is \"cute\" or \"funny.\" I'd even go out on a limb and suggest that males get a pass on binge eating more than females.  However, when you're obese, binge eating is a flaw in your very person, to be judged. That double standard disgusts me. I know this is not a new observation, it just struck me that this observation goes back a lot further than present-day society. \n\nAs a society, we need to cut the crap.

I mean, really??\n\nI work in a school and just started summer break so today he started going on about making sure I eat breakfast, and 3 meals are important, and I should use the summer to get into a good routine. Unstructured time is notoriously difficult for me and last summer was when I really started to spiral. At this point I started to get teary eyed and he asked me what was wrong. I told him that I don't think he understands what I mean when I say that I don't eat all day and then eat everything at night. I do it because I hope the restricting/fasting will continue like it used to and it stresses me out when I do \"give in\" and eat.

This is what I have been trying to tell you!\n\nOn top of it all he started talking about how poor nutrition will start affecting my skin and hair as I get older and that is already a sore spot for me.

Does it just suppress your hunger or does it do something to your mental state that helps you just not eat? I'm losing control of everything in my life because my binges are becoming so frequent that they're almost becoming my default way of eating rather than the occasional binge. \n\nI think I need help and might ask my doctor about Vyvanse. But in curious from those who use it if they are similar to me or not, since binge eating is varied with different causes to different people. I've tried one thing (phentermine) and it does absolutely nothing to me. No change in appetite. Doesn't even give me energy. I just get a slightly dry mouth throughout the day. \n\nThis isn't my entire life, but it's in waves. I can sometimes eat home cooked meals for several months and never binge once. Then it starts to where I sometimes binge by eating my meal plus some chips at the vending machine. Then it evolves into me sneaking to the vending machine to get chips before my lunch but making sure no one sees me.\n\nThen it evolves and gets worse. And I can't stop myself. I just can't. I tell myself I'm going to hate it. I know I'm regretting it before I even eat it but I can't stop. My brain says, \"Today, we're going to get that double greasy grossburger from Burger Hut. Then we'll get another burger from across the street because we still have time.\" and that's it. There is no stopping it as much as I try. And I don't even know why I do this. It's not that I'm hungry. It's like my mind is afraid that I'll  be hungry even though I never actually have a bad time if I do get hungry. And I'm at the part in the cycle where I'm never given the chance to be hungry. \n\nI'm a closet eater. If my lunch isn't big enough for 2 people to be stuffed, then it's not enough. If I think I can sneak in a meal while driving from work to home, I do so. But I don't want my wife to know so I scarf down my \"first dinner\" in the car and to put up appearances that I didn't just binge, I pretend I didn't eat and scarf down dinner with her as well even though I'm full.\n\nThat's another thing. When I binge (which is incredibly frequent, now) I eat until I'm uncomfortably full. But I'm not really ever hungry. It's not like I'm bored, either. I don't know why I binge eat.\n\nSince phentermine is supposed to help your appetite, I hoped it would do something for me to maybe get me into the habit or something. But it didn't. I don't think appetite is my issue, but I don't know what is. Is that all that Vyvanse helps with? Or does it help with something mentally to just say no to food? \n\n I have something mentally going on in my head. I will be ordering something and I'll think to myself, \"Just get the sandwich without the combo. Get a water cup to drink.\" but out my mouth is \"Yeah, I'll take the combo.\" so my brain says, \"just get a small. Or even a medium, please.\" but my mouth says, \"Yeah, I'll do the XXL Super Gargantuan size.\" and then on my way out, I order food \"for the office\" but it's just more food for me even though I'm not hungry. And I eat it in my car so no one can see this.\n\nAnd I'm stating all of this because part of me hopes someone's says, \"that's exactly what I used to be like. These are the exact problems I had and Vyvanse helped me and it's the easy way to fix your problems\". I know it's unreasonable. But I don't know what else to do or how to fix this particular problem. Especially when it's gotten so bad that every meal is a binge meal.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I was successfully restricting for about two weeks straight when I had a nightmare. I dreamt that my mom offered me some chocolate chip cookies and that I had initially refused them, but later I snuck to her room and ate the whole. fucking. box. Then, I went downstairs and ate a whole load of bread. I went upstairs and purged where my mom found me crying about it all. I woke up and cried for about ten minutes, but after everything I was weirdly proud that my ED managed to make its way into my dreams (fucked up, I know).\n\nThe second ED dream I had was probably only about 8 months ago (I obviously don't ED dream often). I dreamt that my parents sent me to a residential ED facility and that everyone there made fun of me all the time because I was \"too fat to have an eating disorder\" even though I want to slap everyone who says that. That's really all I remember about it.\n\nThe third ED dream I had was about 3 months ago. I dreamt that I had finally restricted enough to see my chest bones clearly. In a matter of seconds, I watched myself either away to nothing and watched my family grieve my death. It was horrifying.\n\nThe fourth ED dream I had was the night after the previous one. All I remember about it was that I had restricted well enough that a hole formed in my forearm (between the bones). My dad sat down next to me and told me he was scared for me, and I kept putting my fingers through the holes as his voice kind of blended into nothing. Then, he told me that I wasn't supposed to be like this. I woke up shivering.\n\nIt got kind of dark near the end, sorry about that. But those are all the ED dreams I've had that I can remember. I was looking at someone talking about their dreams and thought \"I've never had any ED dreams!\".

I have had an eating disorder since I found out that I could use my disease to lose weight. Basically the more I ate the more I lost as long as I didn't take my meds(Diabulimia, which drives sugars up to put the body into a state of ketoacidosis(no, not the ketosis you're thinking about, google if interested on why ketoacidosis deadly)).

This is due to nerve damage caused by high sugars in my intestinal track. I was eventually hospitalized and given a 50/50 survival rate. I would get rashes due to the gastro issues and the issues escalated so badly I itched myself until I bled. I would sleep on a towel to keep my bed from getting ruined. I developed an anxiety related skin picking disorder and my back is COVERED in scaring from that because I would reopen wounds several times a day to keep them from healing.

All of my teeth are trying to decay, I have cavities in almost all of them, have had several root canals and just had 2 removed. I had to have cataract surgery at 25, then my eyes started hemorrhaging, so over the span of 3 months I have had 6 eye injections and 3 laser treatments, all of which are extremely painful and I am wide awake for.

Rough withdrawal, plus I started taking them for anxiety and now it's hard to find other medications I can take for anxiety without lapsing back into abusing benzos, but I haven't done it yet. I decided to stop, and I stopped.\n\nQuitting drinking was the hardest. Only my doctors *really* knew how bad my alcohol dependence was. I mean, my friends knew I was an alcoholic and had lost jobs because of drinking and still didn't know just how bad it was. My family was in the dark about most of it. So now even though I've decided to stop drinking, and I have support from my therapist and my PCP and my psych, my friends and family still try to goad me intro drinking, guilt me for not just having one beer for old time's sake.

My stomach's been pretty darn bloated, and it doesn't help that I already feel the fat in most other areas of my body constantly. Usually, I work out to help reduce this annoying feeling, but with the increased awareness of my body fat and my constant exhaustion, I can't do that.

I just saw my friend the other day and though she's in recovery she looked as small as ever, she's not allowed to do any sort of exercise due to her heart being so weak and she doesn't have energy to socialize for too long. I feel terrible for her and from the bottom of my heart wish she's strong enough to truly recover this time. Still, I just couldn't help but feel so jealous of her, how small she is, all the symptoms she has and I know it's sick and twisted but I had to get it off my chest. I feel so fake for not being as \"successful\" and since my friends know about my struggles I feel like even though they say it's all about the mentality and I'm valid I can't help feeling like I'm only worth being worried about if I'm physically at a breaking point.\n\nThe only thing I currently have enough motivation for is losing weight and that's kind of sad since it's summer and I'd have time to dance and write and study and read and whatnot...

Weighing myself at my aunt's house and joining proana chats on Kik. \n\nBefore I weighed myself, my mom did say I was getting chubby, but I never took it to heart, instead choosing to call her out on it and telling her that saying those things could give someone an ED(I had close to no knowledge of EDs then, but ig I knew that those words could have huge impact) Still, her words didn't have any impact on me, even when I'd be binging later on in the Ed journey and she'd mock me eating, insult me, yell at me, etc.(a particularly hurtful one was when she said that I wasn't like a human anymore, and then compared me to a cow or something) and still, though these things hurt and made me feel like absolute shit, I never starved or anything because of it.\n\nSo back to the things that started my ED, the weighing myself. I did it out of curiosity when we were visiting my aunt, it was the end of the day, I had all my clothes on, but I didn't know that those factors played a role in someone's weight, so when I saw I was at 105 pounds I freaked out(I'm 5'4) at the fact that I was in the 100s, even though I was definitely still underweight (might I mention this is also around the time my mom called me chubby which is a little fucked up I think idk)\n\nSo I decided I needed to lose weight, and began the classic Anorexia route of cutting out a little bit of food at first, trying to eat healthier, I lost 3 pounds in one month and was soo proud of that lol.\n\nSomewhere there I convinced myself that I must have anorexia since I want to lose weight, so what do I do? Join a shit ton of proana chats, learn to purge(I don't think I learned to do it from the chats though)\n\nFlashforward to now, three years later and I can't go a week without purging at least three times (which is a lot better than it was at the end of 2018 but still)\n\nI'm sorry this got a bit rambly but I'm just wondering idk, am I faking or did I really give myself an ED? Because it was MY choice to step on that scale, MY choice to decide to lose weight, MY choice to convince myself I was anorexic, MY choice to join those proana chats, etc. And I know pressuring parents may have a big effect on kids but my mother's comments didn't make me want to lose weight, they never changed anything, it was only stepping on the scale that set it all off.(Though I did blame it on her saying that when she was wanting me to eat and stop starving myself).\n\nAlso I've never been actually diagnosed but when my parents took me to an ED clinic I was eligible for bulimia treatment so idk. Also I know genetics may play a role in this, so it might? Be worth mentioning that my mom and two of her sisters were bulimic back in the day so I'd expect my mom to idk be more compassionate or understanding since she's been through this, but since she recovers on her own she thinks I'm not trying hard enough and don't want to stop bc I can't recover. Also she flew into a fit of rage when she found out I was purging and beat me with a belt, just hitting wherever she could, saying she was going to beat me till my ass \"turned blue\", along with giving me some other minor punishments like taking my phone. \n\nThis probably went way off topic, but also I'm wondering if my mom's behavior could've contributed to an Ed if I have one? Bc I feel like it didn't, but with the things she's said and did, it wouldn't surprise me if she played a role? But at the same time her reactions and insults didn't change my eating habits (except when she tells me I'm eating too much and I go and purge bc she made me feel guilty)\n\nSorry again for dumping so much shit here I just wanted to get it off my chest even if no one reads it haha", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I was the chubbier younger sister. I wasn't fat, but my sister was very thin and underweight naturally and was told regularly to eat more to gain weight. I longed for the feeling of people being concerned about me and telling me to eat more (in retrospect this is a very eating-disordery type of thought).  \n\n\n2. My dad once made a comment that I should \"trim down\" and that I was looking \"bulky\" when I was around 11 yrs old. The utter shame in that moment seared that memory into my brain. I promptly began restricting food and trying actively to lose weight. AT 11 YEARS OLD.  \n\n\n3. I was a competitive swimmer for 14 years (age 7 to 20). While I wouldn't trade my experience as an athlete for anything, the pressure to be thin and athletic was compounded by the fact I was in a swimsuit almost daily.  \n\n\n4. At a very young age, maybe like 5-8yrs, my mom was careful about making sure I didn't get fat. She would restrict my food intake. When I occasionally went for seconds on a holiday or family dinner she would ask \"Are you *really* hungry for that?\". I also vividly remember her catching me eating a second piece of pound cake and getting really mad because she said I could only have one. I can genuinely feel the shame of that moment as I type it out. I remember even hiding in my basement, knowing that I was doing something forbidden.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall, I would regard my childhood as very happy and secure, but its easy to see how this monster of an eating disorder was able to grow and underpin my (already plentiful) insecurities as an adolescent girl.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...And looking back at all these experiences, its like OF COURSE I DEVELOPED AN EATING DISORDER.  \n\n\nFYI- I'm 24 now.

I've been in therapy since last August working on my mental health and after transferring schools and being in a better environment eating got easier throughout the school year. I gained some weight, (I stayed at like 92-97 from december-may, I also didn't really weigh myself except for doctor's visits during this time). And apart from a few bad weeks, I really wasn't actively restricting during this time either. I wasn't losing weight and for the most part everyone thought I was okay and my body was just not gaining.

He recommended me to exercise. \n\nSo I started my new lifestyle and October was my first month doing the impossible. I look back and I can't believe how I was so consequent and motivated. Then November through February was again binge eating and in march I finally stopped. Since then I've been battling everyday against my body, many times I failed but I always started again.\n\nMy trick is simple. It's all or nothing. 100% commitment and application and no compromise whatsoever. Mind must control body or else you're a slave. I read everything I could to see how much I benefit from a good lifestyle and I memorized the main pros and cons. Every time I'm tempted I just think about what I lose if I give in.\n\nI've come pretty far and the clear and visible change is now my main driving force. I eat now only once a day, vegan and try to exercise whenever work allows. Believe me,  it's worth it.

It was barely even a joke. I know it was only a 4 oz burger and a pretty standard serving of fries and that I ate less than I should have yesterday and even less today before eating the food I ordered, so it doesn't really bother me. I'm just kinda shocked I guess. I mean he does have a mom, a sister, a girlfriend, and an ex-wife so he has definitely been close to women in his life time so I would think he should just know as a rule that it's not really cool to comment on a girl's weight or eating habits (*or anyone's really, but he should def know for girls*). I guess the women in my family aren't exactly typical ladies though. I don't think I've ever witnessed any of them feeling self-conscious before. Still though, he should know me well enough to know that I'm not exactly a mentally healthy person and that this could be a potentially triggering topic for me.

I\u2019m trying to notice the positive things that are working for me within these last couple days and this is what I\u2019ve found:\n\n1. Drink more water!! I feel like if I keep hydrating myself through the day I find that I will continue this to the night time. (The night time,before bed, is where I find myself most likely to binge)\n\n2. Try to stuff myself with food more throughout the day. I especially try to fill myself in during the breakfast time. \n\n3. Remember to snack! If my stomach is especially bloated that day or it\u2019s really hard to eat that day then overload your diet with snacks. This usually means either breaking up full meals and scatter them intermittently or lots of small snacks all throughout the day. \n\n5. Balancing the foods I eat and where they come from. For instance making sure that I am fulfilling my nutrient counts, instead of caloric counts. This means, for me, minimizing my sugar and carbs while increasing my protein and greens. THIS DOES NOT MEAN RESTRICTING OR AVOIDING. This is so huge for me! The second I disallow food, the more the bad thoughts come in! \n\n6. Smoking earlier unfortunately. I used to use weed as the signal to sleep, but unfortunately my body used it as the signal to binge eat. Weed and binge eating especially tied together because I wouldn\u2019t eat most of the day and then when I would finally smoke, it would exaggerate my hunger and thus the powerful binges overtook me. \n\nKeep in mind that when I say \u2018over-hydrate\u2019 and \u2018stuf\u2019 myself because my binge eating is in combination with anorexia. So when I exaggerate my intake it is because I have trouble accurately identifying \u2018normal\u2019 portions. \n\nNot sure if this will resonate with anyone, but nonetheless I know it will be helpful for even me to refer back to!", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

My family moved us to a new neighborhood where we were a minority (didn\u2019t have anyone from my ethnicity in school with me until high school), and for some reason in this new school kids didn\u2019t play outside much. To top it all of, my bike was stolen in our old neighborhood and we couldn\u2019t afford me a new one yet after we moved. \n\nI was teased in school from day one. The bullying was unlike something I have ever experienced at that point in time. I didn\u2019t understand why everyone was so mean to me, I also didn\u2019t understand why I looked SO different than everyone around me that looked like they just walked out of a Justice/Limited Too ad. I didn\u2019t have any friends, and was used to having tons at my old school, the social isolation really took its toll on me. \n\nThe only thing that made me happy, the only thing I looked forward to, was my daily peanut butter sandwich before dinner. White bread, tablespoons upon tablespoons of that creamy brown good stuff. That was when I started using food for comfort, and it quickly expanded to more food, and I gained a lot of weight by the time I was 11 due to that and the sudden drop in my activity levels. \n\nThe kids at school came in hot and ready with the fat jokes the next school year. My family even made daily fat jokes about me. I didn\u2019t feel safe or welcomed anywhere. I started associating being thin with being loved, and decided the upcoming summer break I was going to turn my life around. \n\nThat\u2019s when the anorexia started over the summer when I was 12. My parents got me a gym membership and I would go with my dad every morning. They watched me carefully weigh everything I ate, and shun \u201cbad foods\u201d that I once loved. The list of bad foods continued to grow, until I was basically eating the same thing everyday. Breakfast was one hard boiled egg and one medium orange. Lunch was one raw bell pepper and one raw cucumber. Dinner was one small chicken breast, and a vegetable side. \n\nI lost a lot of weight, and my family was proud of me. I go back to school and people who teased me throughout elementary school suddenly wanted to be friends. People treated me differently when I was thin, they treated me better, and I became deathly terrified of gaining the weight back.\n\nI would go to the store and steal chocolate flavored laxatives and diuretics, so my family wouldn\u2019t know what I was doing as they\u2019d never buy that for me if I asked. I am surprised I never got caught because that went on for years. I worked out daily, running 5-6 miles a day followed by Pilates for another hour. I kept the same restrictive diet all throughout high school, with the added help of my daily laxatives and diuretics to ensure I was as lovely as possible. I also made the mistake of dating an asshole at the time who encouraged my eating disorder.\n\nBy the time I was 16 I stopped getting periods. My nails were brittle and my hair was falling out. Then I started having fainting spells. I was dragged to the doctor where they told me I was severely malnutritioned and if I didn\u2019t start eating better, I would end up killing myself like this and that I needed to gain some weight.\n\nMy disordered ass only heard that as \u201csweet, they think I\u2019m skinny, better stay the course.\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t take recovery seriously until I met a man when I was 18 that made me feel so beautiful. I can\u2019t even put into words how beautiful he made me feel, I never felt so attractive. He didn\u2019t think I needed to diet, or work out as much as I did. Slowly, I started accepting that for myself. I slowly started incorporating \u201cbad food\u201d into my diet. My body filled up really nicely, we got married a year later, I thought I was recovered. \n\nI was so wrong. \n\nI traded in one eating disorder for another by the time I was in my early 20s. The binging urges from my childhood days came back, and I was eating to cope with the pain of my failing marriage and divorce proceedings. I ballooned up to nearly 200 pounds in a short period of time. I\u2019m a very short woman so this was significant. I was bullied even more severely in college than I was in grade school. People would make fake accounts on Facebook just to message me about how fat I was. I found out my nickname amongst my group of people I thought were friends was \u201cland whale\u201d. I started isolating again, until I decided to start restricting again. \n\nI lost 60 pounds quickly, around the same time the dawn of the instagram influencer started which really fucked with my head. I never felt thin enough. I never felt smooth enough. My skin didn\u2019t feel tight enough. I was driving myself crazy. Suddenly, I also started getting very sick very often. \n\nWhen I was 24/25 I was diagnosed with several illnesses. My GI system is destroyed from my abuse of laxatives and diuretics. My kidneys suck. I have the colon of a woman three times my age. My heart is weak. I had so many problems at such a young age, all lifestyle related illnesses, that my doctors were kind of in awe at this anomaly in their office. \n\nQue the binging again to cope with the reality of living with chronic illnesses. Over the next two years after that, I got back to nearly 200 pounds by last summer. Which lead to a lot of teasing again from my family. It all came to a head when I got into an argument with my sister who told me that I was a fat loser. She was never one of the people who teased me in the past so seeing her join in on it hurt. For some reason being called fat is the worst thing you can say to me. I decided to make a real change this time, something sustainable, so she never has the luxury to talk to me like that again. \n\nSince then, I\u2019ve been trying to lose weight in a more healthy way. I\u2019ve lost about a half pound to a pound a week for the last few months. But, I still have a lot more to lose and I still look chubby. It\u2019s very hard to look in the mirror and not see the drastic changes week by week I\u2019m used to when I used to restrict, when now I\u2019m putting what feels like more thought and effort than ever before. \n\nThe desire to compulsively exercise and restrict to 800 calories a day is so big. It never goes away, it\u2019s a daily battle for me right now. Hence why I\u2019m here writing this while I\u2019m contemplating fasting for the rest of the day only because I ate 125 calories over my goal of 1200 yesterday. If I go down that dark path again, and my health gets worse than it already is, then I\u2019d be almost guaranteeing death before I hit 50. \n\nMy biggest regret is not taking recovery seriously when I was younger and jumping from one extreme to another and calling it recovery. I\u2019m writing this to remind myself why I have these issues to begin with and how far I\u2019ve come, and that it\u2019s not worth it. Hopefully someone here can find some use in this fat girl\u2019s story, and choose to not take that laxative today or eat a real meal for dinner. The health effects of eating disorders are very real, trust me, you don\u2019t want these problems. Recover while you can, and take it seriously. You don\u2019t want to end up like me.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

As the title says, I\u2019ve come up with an idea that I\u2019m trying out and would like to share with you all. I, like all of you, struggle with the monster that is BED. Not only does it diminish my physical and mental health, it also eats away at my bank account, often at an alarming rate. Lately I\u2019ve been thinking of ideas and ways to cope, and I think I finally found something sustainable for me. I figured out that I spend roughly $80-100 on food a week (not counting groceries, I live at home for the summer, so all of this is for fast food, snacks, etc). With this knowledge in mind, I came up with the idea to save 50% of this money and to use the other 50% however I please, as long as it isn\u2019t on binge food. So, each day that I don\u2019t spend money on binge food, I put roughly $7 in a jar, and I keep the other $7 in my bank account. While I\u2019m still taking money out of my account, I\u2019m keeping 50% of the money in my account rather than spending it on food I\u2019ll eat within 15 minutes. This may not work for everyone, but if it helps at least one person, I\u2019ll consider it a success! It\u2019s a nice way of \u201csaving up\u201d for something you want &amp; rewarding yourself, all while actually saving money (and your physical and mental health!!!) in the process.

I don't really think I have an eating disorder because it doesn't feel like it follows the \"right\" way, but on some realistic level I know that I do. I'm currently in the process of a referral to the ED health system and my doctors have told me it is one. But I feel SO bad saying I have one because there are days where I eat EVERYTHING, usually followed from about 3-4 days of no food. It's like as soon as I eat something and I can't stop and I can feel myself being full and uncomfortable and I just keep eating and lately it's been a lot of fear foods during my \"binges\" (that only ever happen when I come back home so I feel like my family see me as a liar because they've now had to have been made aware of the problem) - it's not just the usual junk food binge which honestly feels very clean to me and easy to get over, however uncomfortable. But it's like I'm eating all these cookies and SO much bread. I'm not even hungry. I just want to taste it and as soon as it's gone I just want more of the taste. I don't even care about the calories, I've never been able to be a calorie counter because numbers make no sense to me which is why it's just safer for me to restrict fully than restrict to a certain number of calories per day. Sorry for the off-load, I will say this recent binge has been set off by a trauma and I'm mad at myself for responding in eating rather than restricting even when I'm still uncomfortable and my stomach feels sick.\n\nI'm actually here to ask for tips on how to recover/soothe my stomach/feel better after a binge. My stomach is hugely bloated to the point of immense discomfort, it feels swollen and heavy and I feel like I'm on the constant verge of throwing up. Side-note: I used to purge but have lost the ability to do so purging always scares me now because I feel like a failure when I can't get it up. I'm nauseous and sick and tired. I haven't been to the bathroom in about a week. I've slept since eating yesterday but my stomach is still very much bloated and I feel very sore and sick. It's honestly so uncomfortable for many different reasons but I haven't been able to find any real tips on how to feel better. I don't think I have the energy to exercise or walk it off at the moment, as my body feels broken and the day prior to this I was unable to move out of bed. I'm sorry I just have no-one I can talk to about this as I'm waiting for my counselling referral and I don't have any real friends at the moment and my family is not currently available for emotional support. I also don't know how to really deal with the guilt, as this has also proceeded me hitting a new low weight and I know I would have gained all that weight back AND I feel like this means I can't have an ED and I'm just wasting everyones time and lying to them. I'm also wanting to eat right now even though I'm in extreme discomfort, I'm just craving certain tastes.\n\nI'm sorry, let me know if this is wrong and needs to be deleted.

The day I decided to lose weight was when I came back from vacation I weight 1 4 9 pounds. W t f. My brain finally clicked and went \"you dont need to weigh this much holy fuck\" I realized I needed to lose weight right then and there. I started working out like crazy, ate as healthy as I could and made sure to watch portion sizes. Also I stopped drinking soda/milk completely, and within a month I dropped 10 pounds. I was so happy for myself I kept going, but as time went on I became more disordered. I lost another 10 pounds, and another. Finally to about 2 years ago I got under 120 lbs. I was so happy but then, I for some reason felt awful. I HATED my body, almost everything about it. During the first half of my 8th grade year I refused to look at the scale (this was after a long period of my extream disordered eating). Then in gym we had to do the test and shit. I got weighed but would see it till school got out. I got the letter and my weight was 112lb. Then I went to the doctor during that month and weight 116, then got sick, went to the doctor and weight 113. Now my weight goes between 112 and 116. I'm 14 years old now. And. During all of this. I was NEVER congradualted about my weight loss. My mom was proud, but that was it. My own doctors who TOLD me to lose weight never said anything and it made me feel awful so I kept losing weight and they still havent cared....

Besides, I don\u2019t want to stop earlier. I feel like I have been this miserable for days I want to finish it. But I am also scared of what happens afterwards? I find it really difficult to eat balanced, I either eat restrictive (usually not this restrictive but around 1000-1200 and then I work out) or I binge like there is no tomorrow and sit on the couch all day. I just got out of a high binge phase (past two/three months and gained 10lbs) and I want to use this diet as a jump start into \u201chealthier eating\u201d but what if I am so starved I end up eating all the food and balloon up more? Or what if I can\u2019t stop restricting? Next week Sunday is the official end and I don\u2019t know how to start eating normally.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I don\u2019t even know where to start.**\n\nThe deets:\n\n[Real quick - for those not familiar, the main symptom of narcolepsy is called \u201cexcessive daytime sleepiness.\u201d It\u2019s the equivalent of operating on 2-3 days of sleep deprivation.]\n\nFor the past 1.5-2 months I\u2019ve been struggling with increasingly disordered eating. During this time I had severe depression. I also have narcolepsy (diagnosed 2 years ago) and am taking meds for that, but haven\u2019t yet found the right ones. Those that I currently take suppress appetite, and the most recent one I was trying to switch to frequently made me nauseous and dizzy for most of the following day. As a result I would sleep half the day and had a poor time tolerating food when I was awake. When I did eat, it was very minimal and rarely healthy or balanced. (It doesn\u2019t help that I was already a poor cook to begin with.)\n\nSo basically, I was stuck in this perfect storm of depression which impacts my motivation or desire to eat, exhaustion which destroys my ability to prepare food or even go grocery shopping, and feeling ill or having a poor appetite from my medication.\n\nI\u2019m finally out of the depression and seeing progress on being awake for more than 6 hours, but now whenever I try to eat I get nauseous and barely eat any of my meal. I\u2019m still not eating regularly enough, either, since I haven\u2019t recovered my appetite. Because of all this, I\u2019m dizzy a lot, and I\u2019ve had a significant and rapid loss of weight.\n\nThe narcolepsy community has recommended I try meal planning, which I\u2019m sure will help, but I\u2019m afraid I still won\u2019t eat enough even though there will be easy food available.\n\nI\u2019m really fucking worried about myself, but I don\u2019t know where to begin with seeking treatment. That\u2019s why I\u2019m reaching out to your community. I\u2019m hoping that you might be able to help me find professional advice or point me in the right direction. I\u2019ve not been diagnosed with an eating disorder, but I sure as hell have fallen into a pattern of disordered eating that is having a negative effect on my health and life.\n\nRelevant: I have a psych at a mood disorder clinic, and see a therapist about twice a month - though I haven\u2019t seen either of them since this got bad.\n\nThank you for any help you may provide!", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

If so, how should I get help?", "author": "EDPostRequests", "self_text": "So, for a while, I have eaten a lot and I just assumed it was because I was really hungry. As I got older, though, I kept eating more and more due to various different issues and it just keeps getting worse. I don't intentionally make myself throw up, but I frequently eat until I do. My health has really declined, my throat often burns, my body is really achey, and I constantly feel sick to my stomach. I have been able to maintain healthy body weight, at a few points, my weight was REALLY low. I thought this was normal and just me being a \"growing boy\" as my parents would say when I ate a lot (they don't know the extent of the issue though) but a friend recently said that it was not normal and I should get help. Am I bulimic, and, if so, what should I do to get help?", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

I\u2019ve never been one to resort to bulimia but repressing my hunger. My body refuses to puke, even when I\u2019m nauseous or sick. I\u2019ve tried to stick my toothbrush and fingers to the back of my throat but I\u2019ve only received a gag reflex and no vomit. From there, bulimia was out of the picture. There came another alternative, coffee.\n\nIn highschool, I would drink an excessive amount of coffee to cut off my desire for food in order to feel better about myself. My body was no where near par to the other girls who attended my school. I would go for periods of time drinking coffee in replacement of my meals. I would consume no food and drink coffee instead. Eventually, my body would get to a point of exhaustion and need food so I gave in. When I ate the food, I would eat and eat, extending way past satisfaction. Then, I would feel like I needed to starve myself again. I did that again. Again. And again. Finally, about a two years of doing this, my brother\u2019s girlfriend, now fianc\u00e9, caught on and helped me cope. We started eating regularly together and my diet was regulated. Since then I\u2019ve been maintaining a decent diet keeping my anemia in control. \n\nAbout two years later, now presently, I haven\u2019t eaten in two days and have consumed four cups (12 oz per serving) of coffee. Not eating just makes me feel so much better about myself and I don\u2019t know how to feel good without doing this. How do I prevent myself from falling back into my old habits and control portions?", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

I\u2019m 13 and I\u2019ve been struggling with binge eating for maybe a year but got diagnosed by a doctor not that long ago. I originally posted on r/loseit (if you wanna see my post there) and someone said to try to post here. So I was wondering how to control binge eating? I keep gaining weight I don\u2019t even like to go outside anymore because the way I look is embarrassing and I also don\u2019t want this to affect my health so I need to lose weight, I rather not mention how much I weigh though but I\u2019m 5\u20194 and wwwaaayyy over the average for my height. There isn\u2019t really a certain trigger food it just triggers whenever but mostly at night. I can also eat to the point where I feel sick then get hungry and feel like I need to binge about half an hour later. This is seriously a problem and it\u2019s also making me really depressed. I\u2019m on a medication that\u2019s supposed to help with my appetite (I forgot what it\u2019s called) and it helps a little but I still have this problem. Any advice on how to control this?", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I've kept my ED a secret and my parents and doctors don't know I have any eating issues, but I was diagnosed with depression a while back. Last time I went to the doctor for a checkup, my usual one couldn't see me so someone else did. She asked me a lot about my weight loss, because I lost about 25lbs in the past year after maintaining for years before that. I managed to convince her that I was totally fine and just ate healthier and wasn't trying to lose any more weight.\n\nI'm worried that my regular doctor will be apprehensive about prescribing me adderall, though, because of the weight loss and my history of depression. I feel like it would seem too risky considering it suppresses appetite so much. Plus, by the time I go for an appointment, I'm most likely going to be bordering underweight which will be almost 10lbs below where I was a month ago when I saw the other doctor. I won't have actually lost 10lbs, when they weighed me it was higher than usual because of some bloating and inaccuracy of their scale.\n\nBut yeah. I'm really worried that the doctor won't prescribe it because of my weight, even though I haven't been diagnosed with an ED. I'd be lying if I said I'm not looking forward to the appetite suppressant effect, and that's why I'm pushing to get it as soon as possible tbh, but I do really need the intended effects as well of course.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with this, or maybe with other meds that suppress appetite?
