I've referred some people to this recently in comments but thought the broader community might be interested. The guest on Food Psych's most recent episode also discusses her experiences of this, which may resonate as well:\n\n[https://christyharrison.com/foodpsych/6/how-to-make-the-world-more-accessible-for-all-bodies-with-alissa-sobo](https://christyharrison.com/foodpsych/6/how-to-make-the-world-more-accessible-for-all-bodies-with-alissa-sobo)\n\nEdit: interesting...downvotes.

Originally brought on by a terrible self image that was created after wasting away my post-college years in a drunk stupor that saw me gain weight. After snapping out of this my ED started. I carb and calorie restricted and would run and exercise excessively. In a span of a year I dropped a significant amount of weight. I remember waking up one morning and feeling absolutely floored. Despite the realization I was significantly underweight my dive into nutrition and trying to figure out the perfect diet. I knew (and still know) I need to gain weight but there is a mental barrier I have yet to break. I have reintroduced carbs into my life and have been happy to do so. \n\nFor those of you with better knowledge than me, how much is too much exercise? I know we are supposed to get daily activity but when does it become too much? For me I just can't get passed a day of inactivity or not getting my heart rate up and sweating. I know there are drawbacks from overexercise and believe I am experiencing them. I have anxiety, insomnia, a significantly lower heart rate at times, and feel generally sluggish and on-edge. My blood pressure, which was high prior to my obsessive eating patterns, was recently measured and is pretty low. My typical week consists of seven days of exercise with at least one of those days being a little more \"relaxed\". I have three strength training/HIIT sessions per week that last about over an hour and a fifteen minutes and have three straight cardio sessions where I keep my heart rate elevated for an hour worth of work. My \"relaxed\" day is a day I spend on the spin bike just rotating my legs for an hour. Is that too much exercise? The part I am having trouble with is that I hear and read stories about people pushing it A LOT harder than I do in the gym. They exercise even more and are not suffering from any of the symptoms I am. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs is just because I am still not eating enough for my activity level?

No matter what was going on, if there wasn\u2019t food involved, I wasn\u2019t interested. At parties, I\u2019d always be hovering the food to get as much as I possibly could. Now that I\u2019m a little older and have my own money and my own car and a boyfriend that also loves food (but isn\u2019t addicted like me, per his own statements), I now use every single little occasion-good or bad-as an excuse to go out and eat as much as possible. For instance, every test I do well on, I use as an excuse to go to a fast food place (or worse, a buffet) and stuff my face. Rough day?

Anyway, none of this is exactly relevant except to know that I was already in a vulnerable place and I was only 8 years old. \n\nSo there was this horrible alcoholic (not judging alcoholics at all, but it was the middle of the day when this happened and they were drinking from the bottle) couple that ran a costume shop. They were notorious for being nasty people, but I wasn\u2019t aware of this when I went in to their shop. I was a chubby kid - I\u2019ve always been kinda big but this was the age I really began to comfort eat so I had a lot of baby and food fat. \n\nThe shop keeper (male) grabbed my belly and went \u201coh what\u2019s this, a baby?\u201d In really broken English - basically implying I looked pregnant. And his wife just started laughing. \n\nI was traumatised and heart broken. This was one of the first times I felt true disgust about my body and I was only 8 years old.

Even on the days where I don\u2019t take my vyvanse, I usually still don\u2019t eat. \nFor years I hated eating in front of people, and still I refuse to do it; even if I can feel my stomach eating itself. \nthroughout the course of a week, I\u2019ve noticed I basically starve myself for around 3-5 days- partially because I cannot eat, but also because I am afraid to gain weight (before I hit 12, I was skinny as a pole, then i gained weight after I hit puberty; while i was 13-16 i weighed about 160Lbs and now I am 19 and i weigh 145), and then for 1-2 days I eat absolutely everything I see, but again, I won\u2019t eat in front of people, and honestly I feel like such a piece of shit when I binge eat like this, but I literally cannot stop- it\u2019s like all of a sudden my stomach is bottomless. \nOther times, when I feel myself get hungry I chug back ice cold water, because I discovered that it takes away the feeling of hunger for hours, therefore I don\u2019t have to eat. \nRecently i\u2019ve turned into quite the puker, when I was younger I would only throw up while sick, now it happens often throughout the week, even if I feel completely fine 5 minuets before. \nSometimes, I do induce my own vomiting, but the times I have done so are minuscule to the times it just happens out of no where. \nBut the strange thing is; I\u2019ve started to enjoy the feeling of throwing up, and while I try not to pull the trig too often and make a habit of it, I find myself thinking about puking and looking forward to the next time it happens. \nI have also created a habit of weighing myself, and I legitimately get upset at myself when I see I\u2019ve gained even just 2 pounds. \nAll my friends tell me that I\u2019m not fat, but when I look at myself that\u2019s all I can see. \n\nIs it just the natural consequences of using hard drugs intensely for so long, plus prescription drugs (vyvanse) now that are causing these issues or is there more that I should be concerned about? \n\nThanks for reading this, I\u2019ve never tried to talk or bring this up with anyone really before so I am honestly just confused at my body and what it\u2019s doing, and if anyone can give me any advice I would appreciate it. \n", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

It's hard to say since I've never owned a scale. I'm also transgender and have been on estrogen for like 2.5 years. So like, I've been trying to get myself into a mental state where I'm ready to go back up to a healthy weight because obviously being underweight stunts growth as your body doesn't have the excess resources to make you grow. It was really hard to even get myself up to eating at maintenance, so when I finally got there it was like doing the same thing a second time right away and I think that's why it took so long. But with some recent changes to my prescriptions and just a general trend of reduced body dysmophia over time I've felt like I was ready lately. I've noticed that even as I've been eating a lot more my thighs are still maybe getting thinner (a very tiny bit thinner, possibly just imagining it) and my belly isn't getting any bigger, so I figured that means all of my fat is just going to my chest. Last night I was checking and it definitely seemed like that was happening. For the first time in ages it felt like my breasts were actually bigger. But today they seem really flat and I feel bloated. I feel like this might not be a trans thing. Is it normal for fat to just move around or maybe to appear and then disappear pretty quickly? Or maybe is it possible that it wasn't fat that made it seem like they had started growing again and actually something else? I guess if anybody probably has a clue what the answer is it's mostly likely any girls here who were underweight at a young age, but I know I definitely wasn't paying attention to stuff like that when I was in high school and struggling with other problems, so idk if anyone here will actually have an answer.

Myself and this girl met and have been really good friends since coming to university almost 2 years ago. \n\nBasically, she told me about a really rough, borderline abusive relationship she was previously in before university where the dude (gym nut) would make a lot of very inappropriate comments about other people's weight and such, never directly to her but people who were very similar weights and builds to my friend T. She eventually started to eat less and less, cutting down meals until she was barely eating any of her one meal a day. \n\nThis was all before I met her and she believed she'd dealt with it and moved on eventually. She started eating more regularly and returned to a more natural weight.\n\nHowever, there are times when she gets stressed and she'll almost immediately snap right back to not eating again and the weight just begins to drop. We cook and eat together almost every day but even then, when she's stressed she'll barely eat at all. \n\nShe is honestly one of the nicest and most wonderful people I know and I just want her to be okay. I try to get her to eat as much as I can without forcing or pressuring her, if she can only have 2 bites then that's okay cos at least it's something at that point in time, but beyond that I don't know what I can do to help. \n\nWhen things are stressful she will stop eating and can't bring herself to eat but if things calm down again you can clearly see her eating more and returning to her regular self. However, at the time it seems to act like a vicious circle. One comment about her weight and how much she's lost from her family and she's immediately stressed, which stops her eating which stresses her out even more as she's literally watching the weight drop off. \n\nShe's helped me so much with my own mental health struggles and I just want to return the favour. It scares me to listen to her describe how bad things got before with Sir Pumpsalot and how it made her feel and I don't want her to go through that again, I'd hate to see her like that. She deserves all the happiness in the world, not this undiagnosed eating disorder she's battling.\n\nI'm not even sure what else I can do to help other than do my best to provide her with meals and hope she eats them without any kind of pressure.

So, I checked and I don't believe these kinds of posts are against the rules, but if they are, please let me know and I'll be happy to take this post down.\n\nI just recently stumbled upon this subreddit and have been lurking for a few days, but before I started replying to some threads, I wanted to introduce myself. That seems kind of old-school, but that's what we did on the old ED forums lol so it's ingrained in me. I think I also have just wanted to summarize some things for myself lately as I've been going through a lot of change which has prompted me to think a lot.\n\nSo, my name is Mikhail. I'm 21 years old and nonbinary. My mental health struggles began about ten years ago at the age of 11, when I started having trouble with depression and suicidal thoughts. After my first bout of major depression, I also started experiencing problems with bad anxiety. I've struggled with my body image for as long as I can remember, but it evolved into eating issues when I was 13 - this quickly spiraled into an ED. I don't remember a lot of that time in my life, but it was absolute hell. Absolute rock bottom.\n\nWhen I was 14, I got diagnosed with anorexia and bulimia by my PCP, but I did not actually meet the criteria for anorexia because of my weight. Despite losing a lot of weight (I was overweight when I started restricting), my BMI was about 19 at the time. Just a side note, I guess, as I feel awkward saying I was anorexic when I didn't actually meet the criteria. Still, my medical records show both anorexia and bulimia in my history. But anyway.\n\nI managed to self-recover a little bit when I was 15 and 16. Gained some weight back, stopped restricting as intensively, stopped binging and/or purging as frequently. A therapist then diagnosed me with EDNOS/OSFED when I was 17, as I still had symptoms, but they didn't meet the frequency/duration of bulimia or anorexia. I've continued that struggle for the past five or so years, and it typically follows a pattern: get really bad for a few weeks/months, miraculously get better for a few months, get bad for a few more weeks/months, and so forth.\n\nI'm currently in one of those \"bad\" periods and have been for a couple of weeks now, but this time, it's really fuckin' hit me. I never fasted or used laxatives before, but in this most recent bout, I've had a few days of liquid fasting and abusing laxatives. I'm a little concerned that this may be turning into a full-blown relapse, but as awful as it sounds... I don't really care? There's still a small piece of me that feels like a faker for never meeting a full anorexia diagnosis, for never being hospitalized with it. Even though that year and a half or so was the worst time of my life, something in me misses it. I miss being really sick. I know all of this is bullshit.\n\nAnyway. I've also recently been hospitalized for suicidal thoughts and got diagnosed with BPD and PTSD, so I'm still kind of working through those feelings as well. I also have a suspicion that I have dermatillomania because I've been chronically picking the shit out of my skin for a couple of years now, but I don't know how I'd approach getting diagnosed or getting help for that sort of thing. All my therapists have seen me do it, but they haven't said anything about it lol.\n\nI ran out of steam while writing this, but I think I was pretty much done anyway.

I thought I had this under control, that I would start college and suddenly find something to live for because it gave me purpose. Finally something that would mean more to me than my weight, I suppose something worth getting better for. I just can't do it. The weight wasn't gained in the way that I wanted to gain, it was gained by having out-of-control binge eating episodes. I was trying to come to terms with the weight gain because it was good for me, but I don't want it. I feel myself slipping into who I use to be, and apparently whoever she is, I hate her. She had aspirations and priorities and was able to do a lot of push-ups. Like the real ones, not the modified ones the girls were told to do in gym class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just hate her. I hated her. I don't want to go back to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm fairly certain I failed my biology midterm. In part because I fasted yesterday today, mostly because I didn't study and just couldn't work up the motivation. I took a hydroxyzine in the middle of the afternoon because I was worried I would have an anxiety-induced binge if I didn't. I have two midterms tomorrow and the same thing will happen. I just feel discontent with everything. I don't want to be here, I don't want to be at home, I kind of just want to go and sleep my days away because that's the only time anything is okay. I found some leftover Wellbutrin from way-back-when. I know it made me sad and irritable when I was on it, but I also know that depressed-me is an expert at restricting her calories. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so tired. This is so tiring. Every time my mom calls, she asked how I'm feeling, and it always involves the word \"tired.\" She thinks there is some underlying medical cause, but the reality is that I'm just worn out. If this is what the rest of my life will be, I want a refund. When I have a bad day, she would tell me that it's going to go better. It was supposed to get better last week. Last month. Last year. Nothing is better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only two things I get any sort of pleasure from involve a direct conflict of interest. I like eating until I'm in pain. I like starving myself until just being alive becomes painful. I can't have both. I can't cope with the fact that I can't cope with this just as much as I can't cope with the fact that these are the only two things which matter to me. I haven't called my grandmother in two weeks. We use to talk several times a week. She's my only grandparent, and I'm her only grandchild, and I know every time she asks my mom how I'm doing, she is wondering why I haven't called. I love her so much, and I just can't get the motivation to call her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to do. How to go on. I'm scaring myself. I would have intrusive thoughts of just calling it quits, but I would never consider it a possibility, I would just imagine how things would pan out. It feels less like speculation now. I have no intent to kill myself, I just killed my self preservation. I mix medicines that probably shouldn't be taken together, I don't wash my apples before I eat them, I don't always walk in the cross walk. I think about dying and it isn't this outlandish concept anymore. It's something I'm willing to accept, I've been so selfish up until this point, what's one more last thing? My parents, my friends, or at least what is left of them, myself...I've let everyone down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou know how excited I use to be about my future? When I was little, I would always say that I wanted to become an animal doctor. My room was filled with stuffed animals, I was proud of my animal book collection, I use to actual wake up Saturday mornings and read them. Sometimes during a school night. I loved reading. I loved learning. I liked the little things that made my life mine. Everyone has their \"thing,\" I had my things, I liked my things, I liked piano, and reading, and writing, and going on insect expeditions in my backyard. I liked seeing friends and family and I looked forward to things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm just in a perpetual state of nothingness. I don't know if it's discontent or boredom, but every time anything is happening I just want it to be over. I go to a million clubs on campus because I want to kill time. I stare at the clock until the club meeting is over, I stare at the clock waiting for an acceptable time to take my sleeping medication and go to sleep. I just find everything to be so exhausting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd the thing that gets to me is how much everyone fucking cares. The RA in my building came over to say hello, and I just burst into tears. And he was so kind and thoughtful and spoke to me without being patronizing. Even if I somehow get over this, I don't see where I could get any pleasure. Everything is just so dull, I'm always waiting for things to end. But they don't. They keep going and I keep waiting for something to end for the next better thing. But the next thing comes and it's the same thing. I use to get enjoyment out of things. I would be excited for the next thing, but I was able to be just as invested in the \"now.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinding pleasure in other things would be so nice. Piano is an instrument that I loved, I never played well, but I had fun and that's why I enjoyed it. Piano is nice, it's fun, it can be whimsical, it can be played alone, with a friend, with your cat. Food doesn't do that. Starving doesn't do that. There's no secondary gain. I get nothing out of it other than short-lived pleasure and I don't know why. My life revolves around the fact that I want to disappear and the fear of losing control of my weight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get nothing. I've given up everything and I've got nothing in return. This is so out of my control, it's out of everyone's control, I just can't cope with it and I can't move forward and there's a light at the end of the tunnel, but the illuminated tunnel is just as dull and boring as the dark one. I'd much rather things stay dark, at least I can tell myself that there are better things (I suppose r/im14andthisisdeep would like a word with me).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFood is such a stupid thing. A stupid thing that controls my life. I feel like I've given my life up to boxes upon boxes of off-brand fruit loops. I want a bowl of cereal. And I want it to just be one bowl, maybe with a refill, or two, because cereal is fucking delicious. I don't want to eat it after already feeling sick because I know this day will be a binge day and I'm not sure when I'll get to have these things again. I just want to be a college student who eats like a trash compactor and recognizes that cereal is good for every meal and every occasion. I want to be one of the ones excited when someone says \"there's pizza downstairs, help yourself.\" I want to eat a slice of pizza because I like pizza. And I want to not eat a slice of pizza when I'm full just because I don't know when I'll get to have pizza again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to eat something I enjoy and actually enjoy it. Whenever I eat foods I enjoy I'm always after some type of high, and I keep stuffing myself in the hopes that I'll get some sort of kick out of it. But I don't, because I eat until I'm in pain, and there's nothing fun about that. There's no \"high,\" no rush of endorphins. It just hurts. I keep eating and eating in the hopes that I'll be able to get some type of ethereal high out of what I'm eating, but I can't. And I can't cope with that, so I just keep eating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI push away everyone who tries to help, because I tell myself that they don't understand and they don't know how to deal with it. But the reality is that it's me, I don't understand it, and I don't know how to deal with it. I've let so many people down. I'm giving up everything to this thing that is taking everything away from me. It reminds me of when I was younger, and my TV provider would sometimes tease us with additional channels at no added cost, and then would remove slowly over the course of a few weeks if my parents didn't pay for an upgrade. Having to go from watching Animal Planet to watching poorly-censored home births on the health network was rough. That is what being in school feels like now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm in a place where I should be happy. I love the idea of college. Of school. Of friends. A little birdie told me that the guy I've been hanging out with is interested in me. And I just feel indifferent. I spend time with him because I need constant distractions and a way to occupy my time. He's a good person and deserves someone who is equally invested. I just lack the capacity to invest myself in anyone. How could I, if I can't even do it with myself?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no personality left. I don't know what my personality was but it's gone. I look at myself in the mirror and I can't quite believe that I'm the same person I was a few years ago. Nothing feels real because nothing matters. It's just me, the food, and my weight. And if I'm not eating I'm obsessing over what I would like to eat and if I am eating I'm obsessing over how I should not be eating. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYoung me would be shooketh. I distinctly remember thinking \"I would never develop an eating disorder.\" You know why? Because I convinced myself looks don't matter and my mom is a good cook. And I know that I was able to eat in a way that was healthy and adaptive because I can remember what food tasted like. I don't know what I like or how anything tastes, because regardless of what side of the spectrum I'm on, food is a matter of desperation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no personality left. I have no goals left. I have no interests. Nothing feels important. It's just food and yet it controls every aspect of my life. I can't look forward to anything other than food or weight loss. I try, but it always comes back to those two things. I prioritize this over everything. My parents spent thousands of dollars just for me to check myself out of various treatment facilities. My mother doesn't sleep at night because she's so worried about me. She cries every day. She wanted to take a trip to Florida, but ended up canceling because she was worried I would need her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know. This was long, but it feels good. I suppose this is more appropriate for a personal journal entry, so naturally I decided to post it on the internet for everyone to see.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I lost ~20 lbs slowly &amp; in a relatively healthy way over the course of a year. once I hit about 123 lbs in mid August, I had a big life shift, and started c/s basically every day. I\u2019d eat a quest bar and maybe some veg, eggs, and fat free redid whip w jello and avg btwn 400 and 600 calories of real food per day - everything else was c/s. I\u2019d have at least 1 or 2 days per week where I\u2019d eat around maintenance (1300 - 1500 cal). \n\nI dropped quickly at first, then only got down to my lw of ~114 by mid November. 9 lbs over 3 months isn\u2019t a lot and I was far from underweight, but I was finally starting to feel slim and comfortable in clothes for once in my life. looking back i realize a lot of the loss was probably muscle from being a dumbass and not keeping up w protein.\n\nduring December I had a few moments of b/p that I logged and further compensated w fasting. I gained maybe about 2 - 3 lbs but my body more or less looked and felt the same. then January rolled around and oh ho ho........ it was stress 24/7 for the entirety of the month. I already had poor sleep and it was getting even worse. I never lost my period during restriction but I started spotting despite being on BC. had more b/p incidents (that I compensated for w fasting again). I also started weight training for the first time &amp; began eating ~1000 cal mostly protein, low carb on top of c/s. when I saw the scale go up I assumed it was the water weight from the workouts but halfway thru the month I noticed I had a gut. none of my clothes fit. I gained close to 10 lbs and a lot of the fat went to places it didn\u2019t exist before (eg. back, love handles, thighs). my stomach has always been my stressful area and it\u2019s horrifying to see all the fat pile on so agggressively around my belly. I ffreaked out, kept my protein high but cut my intake to 600 - 800 cal per day. after 4 weeks, I either maintained or gained. I also started getting IBS-like symptoms. I\u2019m stuck now at 123 and the weight will not budge. I\u2019m scared to eat more. I\u2019ve read about reverse dieting and have been trying that for the past 2 weeks w no avail. \n\nI have no clue if my metabolism slammed the breaks or if I royally screwed up my hormones (that were already screwed from PCOS). I\u2019m just so miserable and lost. basically went broke from all the c/s but told myself it was worth it cuz I was finally normal-looking. now it\u2019s torture getting dressed in the morning and I spend the entire day distracted by how my stomach is hanging over my pants and my face is now wide and puffy. \n\nhas this happened to anyone else? I was never  UW so I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s fat and not edema. I want to fix this but I\u2019m just so scared of gaining more weight.

But I binge. And I binge to some worrying extremes.\n\nEvery day I feel a compulsion to have at least one \"session\" where I consume a huge amount of calories. Usually easy to open and eat foods like crisps and confectionary.\n\nWhen I am done with work for the day, my journey home almost always includes going past a shop of some kind so I can stock up on this stuff. And I feel a massive amount of anxiety at the idea of not getting \"enough\" to satisfy the compulsion. So I over-buy. Which usually results in my just eating it all anyway. Once I'm done with eating everything, I usually feel like I've fulfilled the compulsion, as long as its in excess.\n\nI can sometimes control this, and skip the shop on the way home, but this results in massive anxiety as I pace around at my home, and try to talk myself out of going out and buying stuff. Apps that will deliver terrible food to my home are deadly...\n\nWhen I do this, I do it alone. And getting time alone, all to myself, is part of the compulsion. When I spend time with my GF I always feel like I want to leave a little bit early, so I have some time in the evening to spend satisfying this need. I hide this completely from everyone and nobody knows about it.\n\nI often do not enjoy the food as I am eating it. And sometimes I am finishing off a huge packet of crisps, despite my mouth feeling like it is irritated, and hurting as a result.\n\nThen of course follows the giant downer of having done it. And I feel very depressed and hopeless.\n\nMy health right now is bad. And I am very heavy - although I'm quite tall so I can carry it, but I am edging towards just looking like a massively obese person, and these feelings of shame compound the issue.\n\nI have depression and anxiety. I am on a waiting list for cognitive behavioural therapy (six months) and I am seeing a private therapist starting this Tuesday, although I can't afford to see her that many times...(mental health care in the UK sucks.)\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with this stuff, and can they help me?

How Can I Learn To Love Myself?", "author": "EDPostRequests", "self_text": " \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday I fully admitted to myself that I have an eating disorder. I\u2019m tired of putting on the facade that I don\u2019t struggle with a severely unhealthy relationship with food, my body image, and overall self love. I\u2019ve struggled with binge eating for as long as I can remember, but lately I\u2019ve started to purge as well. It\u2019s a new thing, so I want to start right now while it\u2019s young and really get to the bottom of this before it gets worse. First, I asked why? Why am I doing this to myself? \n\nI am terrified of being overweight. I\u2019m a firefighter, I workout very hard, and to outsiders I look extremely strong and fit. I\u2019ve built my identity around being disciplined, and in my eyes a disciplined body looks slightly more lean than mine. I am fit, and these extra few lbs I\u2019ve been obsessing over DONT MEAN A THING! But for god knows how long, I\u2019ve been restricting, calorie counting, you name it. Thus led to my absolute obsession with food. What I would eat, when I would eat it, how I would eat it, what I couldn\u2019t eat, etc. The second I finish a meal it\u2019s like I\u2019m already obsessing over the next one. This is NO way to live? Ultimately the restriction failed me and in times of stress, loneliness, or sadness, I\u2019d binge. And I would be numb for a little bit. But the second I finish I\u2019m overwhelmed with shame and disgust, and even more overwhelmed with the fear of \u201cgetting fat\u201d. So I started the habit of purging, which led me even further down the rabbit hole of self hatred and cruel self-talk. You\u2019re disgusting, a failure, no self control, so unhealthy, why are you so vain?? \n\nTruly though I think this is deeper than just body image. I have deep-seated self esteem issues. I have a history of self-destructive behavior and self-hatred, the roots of which I still haven\u2019t uncovered yet. But as it\u2019s shifted toward bulimic patterns, I realized I cannot let this get the best of me. I\u2019m done. I\u2019m ready to start moving in a direction of healing and self love. I did research on the disorder. I texted a friend I trust and simply said \u201cI have an eating disorder, just felt I needed to tell someone\u201d. Accountability is huge in this process. And then, the hardest part, I fed myself. I binged this morning and subsequently told myself I was going to \u201cfast\u201d (by the way, no more of that) for the rest of the day. No food. Well, by dinner time I was hungry. And I realized that the only way to stop this obsession with food was to give my body what it wants, when it wants it, and listen to natural cues. So I went to the kitchen, and I ate. I had some rice, an apple with honey, and some cashews. Could I have binged? Yeah, but I didn\u2019t. Did I overeat today? Honestly, yes. But the point is I need to change these neural pathways. I deleted MyFitnessPal. Done counting calories for a while. Just listening to hunger cues, satiety cues, and nourishing myself!\n\n  \nI\u2019m not going to sit here and stress about every single thing I ate and run the grand total of calories through my mind over and over again. Life is too damn short. Maybe I gain a few pounds. I probably won\u2019t. But maybe you do? Who gives a damn!? Anyone who\u2019s love is true and worth anything will love you at any physical state. the same goes for love you have for yourself. So be kind to yourself. Eat and eat well, and start living. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are some ways you guys have practiced reversing those neural pathways and learning to treat yourself with compassion?", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

I saw a specialist when I was 15 and had a dietitian (who also acted as a therapist tbh) until I graduated and felt \u201crelived\u201d of my symptoms (I was not practicing, but the thoughts never go away).\n\nWhen I went to college I started back with my bulimia (I was typically someone who would only purge \u201ctraditionally\u201d? but had started experimenting with laxatives). I lived in a residence building and would literally hide in the public washrooms to purge to avoid being seen by my floormates.\n\nSince then I\u2019ve been on and off again, relapsing into heavy bulimia when I\u2019ve gotten stressed until about 8 months ago where I\u2019ve been in a really good place. Not practicing, but I *constantly* think about food, calories, purging, what people think about me, etc. In a world so focused on diets and what not the contradicting health information makes my head spin. Occasionally I\u2019ll have a moment of \u201coh, so I don\u2019t have to be extreme and I can just eat healthy and stay active and that\u2019s what everyone else does?\u201d but then I\u2019m constantly planning my meals and overthinking everything I get so mentally exhausted.\n\nI had a problem with circulation in my ankle so my doctor (a new GP with no history of my ED) sent me to a weight loss clinic because I\u2019m overweight (weird how your metabolism stops when you abuse it like that for 10+ years). Anyway, I was prescribed Saxenda, a weight loss medication, to aid with weight loss. I was also immediately offered a referral for gastric bypass because our health system (I\u2019m in Canada) is so messed up that everyone rushes to fix the physical problem and not the mental (I realize I should have expressed my past but not going to lie I love this medication and the former ED in my head loves the idea of a gastric bypass because then I\u2019ll have less to think about with food... technically).\n\nI\u2019m just so overwhelmed and I want to talk to my closest friend about this (my mom doesn\u2019t like talking about it and I want someone more personal than my therapist). I\u2019m just so embarrassed about my past / feel like I\u2019ll come off as if I\u2019m seeking attention / lazy / I don\u2019t know.

It\u2019s been tough these last couple of months not having her at home. It took residential for my eyes to open about her struggles. During my time alone I\u2019ve cried many nights thinking about how I wasn\u2019t able to see the signs or \u201chear\u201d her cries for help.\n\nI believe her.\n\nDuring my visits I confessed my guilt of not truly being able to understand but have since committed to being by her side and doing whatever I can to support her even if that means just holding her. Gone are the days where I\u2019m more concerned about fixing the symptom (e.g. getting her to eat thinking that was the issue).\n\nI truly love her and will spend the rest of my life on the path to recovery with her. She will never walk it alone.\n\nHowever I\u2019m frustrated. I feel selfish for thinking this way but the last two months alone have been so tough. Having to take care of the house, our pets, family problems, a new job, and other typical drama has me stretched thin. I\u2019m emotionally drained and it\u2019s beginning to physical exhaust me. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I am happily doing whatever I have to do to ensure my wife can receive the support she truly needs but I underestimated the toll it would have on me over a couple of months.\n\nI\u2019ve expressed this to her but it makes her feel guilty and she becomes distracted from her treatment and starts to slip. I find myself in a situation where I\u2019m now bottling my own struggles so that she can recover care free... as a result.. I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m beginning to somewhat resent that I don\u2019t have the freedom to express myself without indirectly being the cause of her triggers. I\u2019ve tried to explain this to her but she can\u2019t help feeling guilt and so I keep it to myself.\n\nNow she will be coming home in a few weeks and I\u2019m afraid of just word-vomiting my feelings and triggering her... but I also don\u2019t want to keep it bottled in.. because it honestly hurts.\n\nI love my wife and I\u2019ll never truly understand what it\u2019s like to experience her struggles but in this recovery period... she\u2019s not the only one in pain.\n\n\\-JP", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

Whether it\u2019s eating in a public restaurant or eating at someone\u2019s house, the whole situation gives me anxiety.\n\nI have no problem going out to eat in public by myself or eating alone at home, I can usually finish the meal. I am also usually fine with family or close friends. However, as soon as you add a co worker, someone I am not close with, or a stranger into the mix, I am very anxious and tend to overthink the whole situation. This anxiety is due to my overthinking that \u201cwhat if I get sick and vomit\u201d or \u201c what if I order a meal and am not able to eat it or finish it\u201d or \u201cwhat if I\u2019m only able to pick at the meal\u201d. If there is a bathroom nearby where I can \u201cescape,\u201d sometimes I feel better and am able to calm down. However if there isn\u2019t, I tend to get more anxious.\n\nThere are many times Ill sit and overthink the whole situation and scare myself beforehand and think of everything \u201cbad\u201d that could happen. In reality, it\u2019s not even that bad. Therefore, sometimes I can calm myself down or sometimes I can.\n\nHas anyone experienced any similar situations? How did you deal with it? Any techniques you\u2019ve used? Any advice?", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

So Please be careful and consult your doctor, and research, before doing anything drastic (I have faith that you already know to do this but am reiterating to be EXTRA...cautious).\n\nJust out of curiousity, has anyone else experienced the same (lowered cravings/urges) with this combo or certain vitamins or supplements? I\u2019m curious if these food urges could be attributed to nutritional deficiencies.\n\nThanks!\n\n*edited for spelling errors and clarification", "subreddit": "FoodAddiction"}

I've always been a really anxious person, and it really was hard when I was younger because I was anxious about my weight but no one would ever believe me because that's just who I was.  A worrier.  Well it turned into something (I don't wanna call it anorexia because I was never diagnosed or severely underweight) and I tried to recover.  I've been doing really well lately but I always have it in the back of my mind that I need to be thinner.\n\nI've recently taken up exotic dancing and it's killed whatever progress I've made.  I literally can't stop thinking about my weight, but no one will help or even try to understand me.  My parents never did, my previous boyfriend never did, and my current one doesn't.  I'm so worried that this is gonna ruin my relationship with my current SO.  Everyone I've ever opened up to always says that I can't have this disorder because I'm already thin.  But I'm not thin enough to be sick.  I haven't harmed myself enough to be taken seriously.  I need to \"get over it\" because it's gonna turn into a problem.  Well it already has, and no one will help me.  No one will even try to understand me because I don't look sick and I don't act sick.  But I'm losing my mind and I'm so alone.  I'm tired of going through this alone.  \n\nI know the people I'm around aren't equipped to help me.  But I just need those people to not dismiss me like it's nothing, because it's everything.  I'll help my boyfriend through anything, but he doesn't even want to understand how this hurts me because I'm not sick enough.  I don't want to pity myself.  I just want to get better and I want to be heard and not played off like it doesn't matter.  It does matter.  People tell me not to bottle my feelings in and speak up for myself but when I do, it doesn't matter, what I'm dealing with is trivial and they just remind me why I don't talk to anyone.  And when I'm forced to tell someone what is wrong, they just tell me I shouldn't worry, then they get mad at me when I do.  And like that even helps me - I would have stopped a long time ago if I could have.\n\nThere is not one person in my life who knows what this feels like, and to make it worse, they don't know how much it hurts for people to tell you that you're not sick and that you don't even need help.  I'm literally crying writing this.  I wanna go back to starving.  I wanna go back to cutting.  And I won't because I've made so much progress.  But mentally, I need support.  I just don't know why people who are supposed to love me won't even try to believe me.\n\nSorry this turned into a rant.  I just am tired of feeling alone and invalid.

I've done some of that by starting therapy and antidepressants, but I still find myself doing problematic things when it comes to eating, including sneaking/hiding food, eating things I don't even actually want to eat, and feeling regret about my eating choices and habits.\n\nThrough therapy I am finding out how much I am a product of my environment, which makes me feel angry and pathetic TBH. I like to think I have more control and individuality than that, but apparently a lot of my behaviors are puppet-like coping mechanisms I acquired. \n\nThinking back to my childhood, my mother (how cliche) was very unpredictable and controlling. How this applies to food is that she would dismiss any preferences expressed regarding foods. One instance I remember in particular is I tried to ask her to get strawberry jam and she said \"no, you like grape jelly\". She also was very controlling about when and how much we got to eat, expecting the amount of food in the fridge and cupboards to never change unless under her direction. We primarily ate processed stuff cooked from boxes and cans, and to actually get fresh fruit and vegetables was a luxury. On more than one occasion she bought strawberries, but as an expression of her control over us we were not allowed to eat them until she said so. So, they ended up in the trash covered in mold. We relied on public assistance for a good portion of my childhood, so towards the end of the month the pantries would be pretty bare. It was always feast or famine, and at the dinner table you better eat it all, and you'd better be quick about it if you want seconds before it's all gone. You know those billboards that say \"Summer isn't fun when you're hungry\"? Well, yeah, that was us. I always looked forward to school starting back up after breaks because we got free breakfast and lunch. \n\nSo now, I'm trying to recognize these things about my childhood and retrain my thinking. I don't have to eat like a famine is coming or I will otherwise be denied access to things, and I don't need to automatically feel like my choices aren't right or valid or need to be hidden. I have learned a lot about cooking and nutrition and I LOVE vegetables, yet I find myself going back to the cheap processed stuff when I am feeling bad or eating \"shamefully\".\n\nI just thought I would share this and I would love to hear any insights you might be able to come up with regarding your eating, and any plans you have to address those issues.", "subreddit": "FoodAddiction"}

I\u2019m looking for an app to track my binges. I'm looking for a format like BowelDiary (tracks pooping, one of my favorite subjects), a favourite app of mine. Just an app that tracks binges exclusively. I'd like something that shows you the month's calendar and you can add 1,2 or 3 stars depending on how \"bad\" the binge. This link has a picture of the app format: [https://goo.gl/images/zo8LZU](https://goo.gl/images/zo8LZU) \n\nI downloaded some \u201chabit\u201d style apps like Strides and Done, but I didn\u2019t like the format. Do any of you track binges? Or any other stuff?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now, a few thoughts on \u201crecovery\u201d:\n\nI, as many of us are in this community, am a particularly anal person. I\u2019d also use the word \u201cneurotic\u201d. I want to say OCD as well, but I\u2019ve read somewhere that unless you\u2019ve actually been diagnosed, it\u2019s not respectful to those suffering from that affliction. \n\nThere\u2019s this story I really like that I read somewhere. \n\nA lady with I can\u2019t remember what mental illness was always worried about leaving her hair dryer unplugged. She worried constantly about whether she\u2019d truly unplugged it and it would disrupt her life, because she\u2019d leave work 2 or 3 times a day to go home and check. She\u2019d leave friends at parties, she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about whether she\u2019d unplugged her hair dryer. No matter how many times people in her life told her it was fine, stop worrying about the stupid hair dryer, no one else does, it\u2019s a weird thing to focus on, she couldn\u2019t do it. She went to a therapist, tried talking about her issues and how worrying about the hair dryer was destroying her life, she was going to get fired and her friends were getting mad at her. But then the therapist suggested - well, why don\u2019t you just take the hair dryer with you?\n\nSo she did. Stuck it in her purse every day. And ta-da, no more leaving work, no more leaving friends hanging, no more anguish and constant worrying about the hair dryer, it worked like magic now when she\u2019d get paranoid, she only had to look in her purse. Now she was free to think about her future, and work on her relationships and focus on her job, she got a promotion, yadda yadda, happily ever after, lady carrying a hair dryer in her purse for all eternity, impractical and stupid, yet a brilliant solution.\n\nMy ED is the hair dryer at home. And I\u2019ve found a way to put the hair dryer in my purse, metaphorically speaking. I\u2019m not cured by any means, but I\u2019ve found a way to circumvent the weird paths my brain takes and not destroy my career or my relationships. \n\nI quantify everything I do. I log calories consumed, fiber intake, sugar intake, water intake, dumps taken, sex had, PMS symptoms, money spent, weight gained or lost, hours spent on a painting (I\u2019m a visual artist), exercise, books read, to do lists. I'm getting married soon, it's been a fucking joy to plan on Excel. \n\nIt\u2019s impractical, it\u2019s time consuming, but it\u2019s a hell of a lot practical than having a full-fledged eating disorder for me. \n\nI\u2019m not going to say I\u2019m recovered, because that\u2019s not true. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be fully recovered, and I\u2019ll always have setbacks. I\u2019ve accepted that about myself, and that\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve developed my \u201ctricks\u201d to get me out of that head space. Some times it\u2019s easier than other times. I\u2019ll never stop wanting to be smaller, tinier, fragile. That want will always be there, aching in my fucking lungs, and that\u2019s okay. \n\nI used to abuse laxatives. I quit cold turkey 3 years ago and haven\u2019t touched one since. I downloaded an app called BowelDiary and have recorded every single bowel movement ever since. Now, when I get antsy, or paranoid about not having pooped in a while, I can force myself to say- Look, Frida, here\u2019s the empirical evidence that you took a shit last Monday, YOU\u2019RE FINE.\n\nI log every single PMS symptom and sex encounter on Clue. That one was fun for my husband to see. I made charts and shit. \n\nOn the Health app, I log every time I gain or lose weight. Now I have empirical evidence that LOOK IT\u2019S FINE YOU\u2019RE NOT A WHALE, what goes up must come down.\n\nI log every single calorie I eat on LoseIt, and that\u2019s okay, because then I know I haven\u2019t eaten too much, and I can make sure that I\u2019m eating enough. I haven\u2019t restricted in a long time. I can see my sugar intake, fiber intake (another favorite for the anal pooper in me), water intake, exercise habits, sodium, most common foods- I love it all. \n\nI have an app called HoursTracker that tracks every single hour I spend on one painting. \n\nI track my finances, I log every single purchase, I make fucking charts at the end of the month detailing percentage of how much money went where. I\u2019ve actually begun to have some savings. \n\nA few months ago I had a manic episode where I made a list in excel on every single book in my library, categorized by title, author, year published, subject, and whether it\u2019s been read or not, followed by a list of books I want to buy at some point. It gives me joy to fill in the \u201cRead\u201d category, and it\u2019s motivated me to read more. \n\nQuantifying my life is how I\u2019ve created habits for myself, it\u2019s how I give myself the illlusion of having control over my life and replacing, somewhat, the illusion of control restricting gave me. I don\u2019t know how to describe it, but it gives me joy. It\u2019s impractical, it\u2019s time consuming, but at least- I\u2019m healthy, I believe I\u2019m in control without destroying myself, I\u2019ve redirected my neurotic tendencies into healthier outlets. It sure beats the head-space of the restriction-binge cycle. \n\nAnd now I don\u2019t bother my friends talking about the frequency of the dumps I take or whether I\u2019ve eaten too much today, and everyone\u2019s happier. \n\nSo, to reiterate the question: do any of you use apps to track stuff? I\u2019d love to hear about other people\u2019s habits. I\u2019m looking for one specifically geared toward quantifying how many times a month/year I binge in an effort to get reduce that habit (because lord knows I\u2019ll never stop completely).

I'm 23 and I think I'm at a healthy weight? Most people tell me I should try and gain a few pounds, but I like how small I am. I have huge issues with food that started when I was a teenager and got put on antidepressants. I gained a lot of weight and went from being the cute skinny girl to the fat girl in school everyone made fun of. Once I realized I was borderline morbidly obese I started working out and got to a normal weight. It took a few years, but I was healthy.\n\nWell, I got into a shit relationship when I was 18. The guy was very controlling and next thing you know I'm looking for one thing I can still control in my life and that ended up being food. I lost roughly another twenty pounds over the course of the relationship, which recently ended. Now that I'm single and depressed (was a bad relationship but I'm still mourning it) I find that I'm focusing on food even more. I've been bingeing when I get depressed, just stuffing my face. Now, I don't make myself throw up, but I do know my bodies limit for food and a lot of the times I eat past that limit because I know my body will force me to throw it up. There's been a few times where I drink too much because I know it'll make me throw up everything I've eaten in the past few hours. If I'm not doing that, I monitor what I eat and my calories. I'm BIG into tracking my calories (even though I end up bingeing a lot of nights and ruining it all). I've taken quizzes online and they always say I'm leaning towards the anorexic side, but then I tell myself \"Oh it's just a dumb quiz online! Like an IQ quiz, it's not necessarily right!\"  I'm obsessed with my weight; I mean if I can't be happy, at least I can be pretty and skinny?\n\nBasically, do I need help? I think I need help sometimes, but I'm not forcing myself to throw up and I'm not at a weight where a doctor would be freaking out and putting me in a hospital because I'm underweight. I feel like I don't have one because it's not that serious?

I struggled pretty extensively with anorexia since I was about 16 but never really realized what was going on or my issues until I was 20. I'm a guy and was extremely underweight until I was 12, then i was taken off adderall and started gaining a lot of weight. My mother wasn't exactly the best. She'd always tell me that I was fat after that, at one point she was forcing me to go to the gym everyday or I wouldn't be allowed to do things at home, despite living a very active lifestyle. From that point I started developing really intense body image issues, mix that with being in a very detached and poor home where there was never food or adults around, I just completely stopped eating. Not with intent or anything, I just felt sick all the time and didn't have money to afford it until I was able to get a job at 17. At this point I was down to what most people would consider skinny, and people would tell me I've lost weight and I look good so I just kind of thought things were normal and that I was healthy.\n\nThis all went on until I was about 20, I was living with my at the time girlfriend and things were absolutely awful. I started working out constantly and eating even less, sometimes going literal days without eating. I thought I looked good but at this point my best friend told me she was concerned and that she thought I had an eating disorder. She's a medical professional so I took her words to and diagnoses to heart but just couldn't stop things. By the time I was about halfway through being 21 I was the skinniest I'd ever been since I was a child. It got to the point I had to order clothes online because I couldn't find anything that fit where I lived. But I just kept restricting and working out. I don't know why, there's just this feeling or voice that would push me on and everytime I looked in the mirror and looked smaller I felt better about myself.\n\nShortly before I turned 22 I started dating a girl and we were excellent for eachother, we moved in together shortly after starting dating and since she has similar issues and felt comfortable with eachother. We started supporting eachother and encouraging eachother to eat more, having a lot of dinner dates, and cooking together all the time. It got to a point we were both pretty healthy weight wise until about December last year.\n\nBy then I started having intense depression issues and body image issues with them, she was also having some mental issues involving paranoia and delusions. She ended up moving back to her mother's to be safe, work on herself, and be around professionals (her mother is a psychologist) in feburary. And things have continued slipping down hill much more quickly since then. I've started eating once a day and working out more, counting the calories on everything I eat, and having worse dysmorphia issues. I tried to get back in with an old counselor that was really good for me, but they won't take my insurance. I don't really have a lot of resources, the only friend that knows is my bestfriend and I don't like going to her with problems because she has a family and responsibilities. I live in Alaska which a very masculine and rigid place, so there isn't really any support systems or anything like that around me, especially for men with the masculinity issues here. I know things are getting bad again, and I really don't want them to regress to where they were.\n\nHow can I get better?\n\nI'm sorry for the long post, I just don't really know where else to say this or where to look for resources.

She bought her own casket yesterday. She talks about her fiance, her mom and dad, the things she'll miss. She was funny, strong, she made me cry. Even though I'm thoroughly depressed, I hardly ever cry, I cant feel very much nowadays.\nAfter reading this, I realized that I dont want to die.. and if I continue on like this, I inevitably will very soon. A body can only take so much. \n\nLast week at 2am I signed up for a new dentist, on the online intake form I told them that I was a bulimic in recovery, which wasnt true as I filled it out, but it's true now. And it's a good thing I signed up, because after years and years of purging I chipped the back of a damn tooth yesterday. I'm contacting a dietitian as well, and I've been seeing a new therapist for a couple of months now. Shes a super sweet lady, I like her.\n\nI havent been taking my antidepressants for months (insurance hassle, plus they don't work if you just throw them up anyways), but I just got 3 months of it ready to go and am picking them up tomorrow (or I mean today, but its 5:30am here). \n\nI've tried to recover before. Usually I can make it a few days if I'm lucky, but I would rather get struck by lighting and sent straight to hell if I don't make this time stick. The main fuel I'm using tbh is spite. This ED may have taken a bunch of lbs off of me, but it also took part of my tooth, that's not allowed. \n\nI will no longer purge. I will try my damndest not to binge. I will no longer average 10 drinks a day. I will try to build a healthy relationship with food. But most importantly I'll try to be happy, because I havent been in a long while. \n\nAll that being said, I'm gonna stick around the ED subs for a while, I like you guys. You're my friends and the most honest people I've ever met. I wish you all the best and I love each and every one of you. You're all worthy of love and happiness, I hope you find it. \n\nGodspeed", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Yesterday, we had to give presentations on our body image. There was no real criteria so people read poems, showed drawings and photos, stripped down to their underwear, and just talked.\n\nI chose to do a slideshow of zine-style drawings depicting my journey with my body image and talk about them. The [body drawing](http://imgur.com/a/YvDO9yv) was the first slide and obviously the hardest to show. It wasn't blurred, I just did this because I'm honestly still uncomfortable with showing it to a bunch of people. I am currently fat, so the statement of I'M FAT in the corner and the drawing itself aren't even a result of distorted thinking. As with many people here, my body is a locus of trauma and whether I view it through a \"real\" or distorted lens, it will always fill me with disgust. I also showed [this one](http://imgur.com/a/ZW6oHNI) about the battle between the \"wins\" of disordered eating and the repercussions it has had on my body/life.\n\nIt was super nerve-wracking to have these projected on a huge screen. I cried. Some other people talked about eating disorders, and everyone talked about their various insecurities, but they were all about how they've improved and grown and healed. I was the only one in an active backslide. I could have lied, but things are so bad for me right now that it would have felt disingenuous.\n\nPeople were super supportive and gave me a ton of affirmations, and I'm very very proud to have shared this, but showing and vocalizing all of the things I've been through and the terrible things I think about myself made me feel like even more of a piece of shit. Real talk, I'm embarrassed to even be alive right now. Still processing.

I was scared back then, and ridden with a lot of shame. You didn\u2019t really seem to mind, just relieved I wasn\u2019t confessing about taking drugs. You told me to \u201cstop it\u201d and that I was trying to \u201ccheat\u201d my weight loss.\n\nYou know I\u2019ve always had a bad relationship with food, since I was in year 10. It\u2019s been 6 years now, and things have only gotten worse. I used to emotional eat, which spiralled to Binge Eating Disorder, and Bulimia for about 8 months now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know maybe it\u2019s a cultural and generational thing, but you are a \u201ctiger mum\u201d. Even though you complain that I\u2019m hiding secrets from you all the time, it\u2019s hard to open up to you when I know you\u2019ll berate me, blame me or bring up old scars we have. And it\u2019s worse, knowing you adamantly refuse to believe in depression, mental illnesses or professional psychological support.\n\nLast night, you blamed me for being \u201cweak\u201d in my relationship with food and if I was \u201ctruly dedicated\u201d you said I would only drink water and vegetables and exercise secretly (basically stating restrictive/anorexic behaviour). I\u2019m sorry that even my eating disorder isn\u2019t good enough for you. You said I was just \u201ctrying to take shortcuts in my weight loss\u201d by purging.\n\nDad made me feel just as hurt. He asked me why I purge when I have all the privileges and a good life. I know I\u2019m privileged and everyday I\u2019m immensely grateful but somehow that doesn\u2019t translate to my sense of self worth and self image. I\u2019m sorry. He also kept asking me if I purge for attention. He doesn\u2019t know I\u2019ve been doing this for several months now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I explained my issues with food and self-image, Mum, you decided to make it about yourself- complaining and tearing up about how you feel insecure about your skin. I don\u2019t understand how this had anything to do with the conversation, but then again I\u2019m realising how you\u2019re more narcissistic than I realise. And I\u2019m sorry but you don\u2019t get to say how you make me feel- only I have the right to that.\n\nYou denied how you impacted my sense of body image. You gaslighted me and acted hurt that I felt the years of your words and actions contributed to this. Do you not remember forcing me, even now, to weigh myself daily in front of you? Just because \u201call the fit celebrities weigh themselves daily\u201d? Don\u2019t you remember sleeping in the same bed as me, only last year when I was 20 years old, because you didn\u2019t trust me? And then without warning grabbing onto my belly fat? You said I purge for attention and you don\u2019t understand my body dysmorphia when I look at photos of myself, but the other day you said my face was as bloated as when I was 15kg heavier. Can\u2019t you see I\u2019ve internalised your critiques?\n\nYou blame the purging on all the \u201cweird books and youtube and websites\u201d I read when I was younger. But I\u2019ve mentioned it to you before that it was you who taught me how to purge. One day when I had eaten too quickly and was in nauseous pain, you suggested that I force myself to purge to relieve the pain. It worked and the seed was then planted.\n\nI wish I could tell you how much self-hate I have. Dad, I wish it was as easy as saying \u201clove yourself more\u201d. It\u2019s like telling a depressed person (which I am also) to \u201cbe happy\u201d- but you wouldn\u2019t understand that analogy either.

I\u2019m in the same situation as when I opened up to you about my depression and suicidal ideations. My GP is my aunt and uncle so I don\u2019t feel comfortable talking to them. I could go to another GP and get a referral to a psych, but I\u2019m on the same Medicare card as you and I don\u2019t want you to find out because you hate psychiatrists and think it\u2019s a waste of money and force me to bring you along to all the sessions to make sure I\u2019m \u201ctelling the truth\u201d and now \u201cembarrassing\u201d you.\n\nI know you won\u2019t like it but I\u2019ve talked to my uni\u2019s free counselling services. It was the first time I had told anyone about my bulimia. It was one of the most cathartic days of my life, but I\u2019m still scared you\u2019ll find out about it and get angry with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI eat because I\u2019m depressed and find comfort in food. When I eat, I dissociate and binge because I tell myself I won\u2019t allow myself to eat this again so I should eat as much of it while I can. I purge because of the shame and fullness from eating, especially if it\u2019s \u201cbad foods\u201d. I do this all in secret and don\u2019t like eating in front of you. I restrict because I feel the need to compensate and punish myself, and I restrict when I eat with you because I want to \u201cmake you proud\u201d and show you I have self-control. You already know I abuse laxatives too.\n\nI\u2019m on the verge of falling into extremely restrictive tendencies, in order to \u201cprove you wrong\u201d and \u201cvalidate\u201d my ED.\n\nI wish you understood me.

But with her breathing down my neck it's making it really hard to restrict to where I need to. I usually eat about 400 to 700 cals a day when restricting. She only sees me during lunch but I don't want to buy school lunches because they're served on disposable plastic trays (i don't like to use more plastic than needed (#envirnmentsaver amiright)) but I always too tired at night to pack my own. I was fine not eating at lunch for Mon. &amp; Tues. but got called out for it.

I think I have a pretty reasonable GW for my height, which is 140lbs at 5'8. \n\nThat being said, I've been trying to recover from binging by fasting. Yeah, I know, but it actually does work for lessening food's emotional pull which is helpful for me AS A BINGER (I'm NOT encouraging anyone to use it if their ED is restrictive). \n\nFor the past two and a half weeks, I've done 3   48 hour fasts and eat reasonably between them. It's the longest I've gone without overeating/ binging in...years. However, the scale hasn't moved.  I know I'm at a deficit, especially since I'm a pretty high BMI, but there's a voice that says \"if you're still eating, that's cals you're not burning. Your metabolism is fucked and you won't ever reach your GW\"\n\nI'm taking a break from fasting the past two days because I have a cold, and am trying to do this as healthily as possible, but I usually lose a lot quicker and it's discouraging me. I'm also PMSing, which I know has something to do with it (bloating, emotional, extra cravings). \n\nI'm just frustrated that I'm not seeing results and want to expedite the process until I can consistently see the scale go down. Once I see that, and can see a difference in my body composition (around 185, 15lbs from where I am) it's easier not to binge because I have proof that the effort is worth it. \n\nBut right now, I'm sick and PMSing and bloated and feel like binging, or at least treating myself to more than TDEE. \n\nI just need some reassurance that if I don't binge, and keep eating (and fasting) sensibly, I'll get over this bump and will see progress soon. \n\n(Please don't try and talk me out of fasting, it's worked the best for me in the past and stops me from obsessing over food. I'm not doing long ones, and it \"resets\" my stomach so I'm not so sensitive to the feeling of hunger, which I fucked up by binging. ) \n\nThank you guys for reading.

I eventually started to sneak carrots and some Italian dressing while at work which was the start of my weird food sneaking habit. I got down to about 89 lbs before my family forced me to see a nutritionist. I left him and am now in a loving very supportive partnership. Eventually this strange habit carried over long after we broke up for some reason except it eventually gravitated to junk food. My husband found some junk food in one of my dresser drawers when I asked him to find some socks for me and was extremely confused, but also concerned about why I would be hiding things like oatmeal pies and twinkies. It\u2019s important to note this is the only healthy relationship I have ever been in so I don\u2019t really have a logical reason why I still do this. I have been trying to eat healthy by meal planning etc but every night I find myself visiting my favorite junk food hideouts and over eating by myself and feeling extremely guilty about it. Lately it\u2019s been spicy top ramen noodles which 100% are giving me indigestion issues but I keep doing it. I don\u2019t know if this food hoarding/hiding thing is just something I do and I feel really embarrassed even talking about it, but it would make me feel better to know Im not alone or if other people found a way to overcome this.

I didn\u2019t eat for days after that, but that\u2019s a perfectly fine thing for someone to say, why did it bother me so much?

I had Tinder when I first moved back in August for, you know, sex, lol, and I met this guy on there that I started hooking up with who was 27. Now, his age didn't really matter to me since we were just having sex, and I was the one who initiated the whole thing, but then I started to like him, and now we're dating. At first I was reluctant because of the whole age gap thing, but it all happened naturally and wasn't weird at all, so I just said, \"you know what, this isn't wrong, this happened in a normal way, so I think it's okay to put that aside.\" \n\nAnd so I did, and things have been great. We have a good sex life, we're both pretty open to each other, and he knows about my eating disorder and checks on me to make sure I've eaten, but doesn't push too hard if I refuse. I know all about his childhood/family/life, and he knows about mine. We even went to New Mexico for a few days together that was a lot of fun in December.\n\nHere's where the problem came in: he lied about his age on Tinder. Not specifically to me, he just had it set as 27 to have different options, I guess? But as it turns out, he's actually 30. So now, that 9 year age gap I was willing to put aside is actually 12 years. Which, if I was like 30 and he was 42, it would be different. But we're not. I thought about breaking up with him when I found out since that just sounds like too big of a difference, but the thing is ..I really like him now. If I found this out at the beginning of our relationship, I would've ended it then, but now? I'm attached. \n\nSo I'm here, looking for your unbiased opinions on how this sounds to you based off of everything I said. I can't ask my parents caused they'd flip their lid knowing he's 30 and not 27(which was already pushing it for them as well), and I only have a couple friends in college who find the nine year difference odd, too, and don't really know him that well, so I feel like everyone I can ask in person would be too biased to give me a good opinion on this.

{"post_id": "azd5o9", "created_utc": 1552200532, "title": "Have fun ODing on fiber and laxatives, you thieving cunt! That should teach you not to touch my safe food.", "author": "Swanabe", "self_text": "TLDR at the bottom. \n\nLet me preface this by saying that not only do I have a restrictive ED, but I have several unrelated health issues which require me to avoid certain foods, and requires that I include a certain amount of other foods. Because of this, paired with my ED, I have a very limited diet with not too many food options. The foods I buy myself really are my only options. I almost always can\u2019t just \u201ceat something else\u201d if someone takes the food I\u2019ve bought for myself, I have to go get myself more food, or starve. My food is also often quite expensive since if I want anything tasty I have to get specialty items. \n\nMy whole family knows this and is generally respectful, with one exception: my sister in law.\nShe was fine about it until she had kids, became emotionally unstable, and started getting constantly catered to by everyone. Now she thinks she\u2019s queen shit of fuck mountain, and does whatever she pleases with no regard for anyone else. This includes eating weeks worth of my safe foods when she comes over. Fortunately, she only goes for my dry goods (all the my stuff that needs to be refrigerated is stuff she\u2019s not interested in because it\u2019s \u201ctoo healthy\u201d). \n\nShe will DEMOLISH any little indulgence that I might be parceling out over a month for myself though (snack packs, 100cal baggies of weighed Lily\u2019s almond chocolate, specialty baked goods etc), and it pisses me off, ruins my budgeting, and fucks up my meal plans. So, I started hiding my little treats in my bedroom. That worked for about a week, but then last weekend when she was over with her kids she sniffed out my stash like a grizzly bear, and ate thousands of calories and $50 worth of food while I was out walking my dog. I was livid and confronted her, she cried to my brother and parents that I was shaming her and that I was selfish. She also claimed it was the first time she\u2019d ever done it (bullshit), it was a misunderstanding (TOTAL crap) and she wouldn\u2019t do it again \u201cif she could help it\u201d(you\u2019re an adult woman!). My parents told me they\u2019d pay to replace anything she ate 3 fold if I\u2019d just drop it and save them the headache. \n\nI took that deal, bought myself replacements for my stolen food, a food safe, and a few **extra special** treats *just for SIL to find*.  I bought a bunch of fiber one bars, which I usually don\u2019t get, and laxative chocolate (I\u2019m not a laxative user) which I portioned into little baggies like I usually do with my Lily\u2019s and bakery items. I put all the food I actually wanted inside my food safe, but stacked the fiber one and laxative in their baggies on top (I also put some snack packs and rice cakes with it so it wouldn\u2019t be too conspicuous of a trap), and labeled the foods on top \u201cPlease do not eat, these are my safe foods!\u201d. Today she brought her brood over, and I took the dog for a walk as usual. Lo and behold, everything that wasn\u2019t in the safe was totally devoured when I got back. She confronted me about the safe, and said I was overreacting (amazing, given the fact that she\u2019d just raided literally all the food I hadn\u2019t locked up), but I just responded pleasantly that I was trying to ensure there\u2019d be no more \u201cmisunderstandings\u201d. About an hour after she confronted me she started to look a little green and kept running off to the bathroom. She looked miserable, and ultimately had to call my brother to come pick her and the kids up because she didn\u2019t think she could drive. \n\nMy brother just called me a few minutes ago, because apparently she shit herself in the car on the way home, has shit herself 4 more times since, and is having a mental breakdown. She\u2019s been blaming me and claiming I poisoned \u201cher food\u201d. I feigned confusion. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t touch her food-...Oh! Oh my god! I didn\u2019t even notice that SIL had eaten ALL of my food again today but I just checked and she ate everything that didn\u2019t fit in my safe!!! Oh no! Oh my god! When we talked last week she said she wouldn\u2019t do that again, AND I put a note on everything that said not to eat it so I thought it would be ok! No wonder she\u2019s sick though! She ate 4 full boxes worth of fiber one squares, and a whole laxative bar! You should take her to the doctor!\u201d  . There was a long pause, my brother didn\u2019t know what to say. Finally he asked why I had laxatives and tons of fiber one, I told him I\u2019d been constipated and since it was in my room,  labeled not to eat it, and had been discussed previously I didn\u2019t think it would be a problem. He let out a long sigh and asked me what kind of laxatives and what the dosage was in case a doctor asked. I told him, and we got off the phone amicably, he even texted me an apology about her eating my food again, and offered to Venmo me money for it. He seems to either believe I didn\u2019t do it intentionally, or feel as if he can\u2019t be mad about it if I did because his wife is a gluttonous lying thief. They\u2019re currently en route to urgent care, and I\u2019m quite pleased with myself. \n\nNever mess with a sick girls safe food. \n\n\nTLDR: SIL continuously steals my safe foods despite being confronted multiple time and being asked to stop, and understanding that it\u2019s a really big issue for me and my overall health when she does. I put fiber one bars and laxatives in place of my safe foods. She ate them all in the span of 2 hours, and got very sick. \n\n\n**Update**: \n\nFor all those worried about my SIL, she\u2019s physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\nTo those who are concerned about the legal implications of my actions, I did do a bit of research beforehand, and because the food was behind a locked bedroom door, labeled not to be eaten, AND I have proof of previous conversations where I\u2019ve asked her to not eat my food I\u2019m pretty much in the clear. Also, my SIL has no financial ability to acquire a lawyer to sue me without my brother\u2019s support. My brother would absolutely not support her in any attempt to seek legal action. \n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Throw in these life changes and my binge eating spiraled out of control. I was having 6000 calorie binges almost every day. I gained 50 lbs from May to February. My life was controlled by my bingeing - food was the only thing getting me through my days. \n\nI\u2019ve been in counseling and started to see a psychiatrist as well. After we reduced my bipolar symptoms, she wanted to start tackling the binge eating. I had read about success stories from Vyvanse but felt weird bringing it up because it\u2019s a stimulant. My psychiatrist was actually the one to suggest it which shocked me. She ordered an EKG and wanted my blood pressure taken (plus the blessing of my GP.) \n\nI have been on Vyvanse since last Tuesday and I am happy to report that I have been binge free since! I expect hurdles down the road and I don\u2019t expect to rely on this forever but I can\u2019t tell you how happy I am to feel like bingeing has stopped taking a hold of me. \n\nIt\u2019s such a weird feeling to be out running errands and catch a glimpse of a Dominos commercial and not become obsessed with getting pizza.

Now, I\u2019ll think of a food that I loved to binge on (McD\u2019s nuggets - 30 nugs, ya feel me?) and I\u2019ll think of it as \u201cyeah those are good but I\u2019m not in the mood to eat them\u201d and then I go about my day. I actually went out to dinner and didn\u2019t finish my meal! And it didn\u2019t bother me that I didn\u2019t! The anxiety of not ordering enough food is no longer there. \n\nSorry for the long post, I\u2019m just incredibly excited and I\u2019ve even had emotional moments because of this and it\u2019s only been a week! I wanted to share my experience to add to the other success stories or for anyone on the fence of trying this medication.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I've been really struggling with bingeing the past two months and I kinda know why but not really. It just keeps getting worse and worse, like 3 or 4 times a week of eating over 5,000 calories. In the moment I just can't control myself but after I don't understand why I couldn't make the choice to say no. Something just takes over and it just happens. I don't even know where to start with coping with it and changing my habits. The past year or so I've been trying to lose about 10-15 pounds cause I'm just a few over what I feel like is a good weight for my body (5'8 F and want to be 150 lbs, currently 160/165). I'm not overweight or anything, I'm just not too happy with what I look like sometimes. I workout 5-6 times a week weightlifting and not much cardio. While I do think this may play a part in the bingeing I don't think its the main reason.\n\nI tend to eat emotionally SO BAD. Like if I'm uncomfortable in a situation my first thought when I'm alone, is to eat alllll the food. For example last night, it was so sad and was kinda when I knew I needed to change. I went on a date and the guy was really cool, I just wasn't super into it and kinda wanted to go home. He was kissing me and the only thing I could think about was the damn caramel M&amp;Ms I was gonna buy at the store when I left and how I wanted to eat the whole bag:(. Might I add too that I recently have been diagnosed with herpes, and not that its a big deal I know it has affected my self esteem and my dating life. I feel this way when I'm in stressful situations, school and all that stuff and it seems like I'm always worried or stressed about something even though I feel like. I have no reason. I'm so fortunate (and grateful) at where I'm at in my life.  I'm young, in grad school, on an athletic scholarship for school, amazing friends and I feel like I can't be upset or stressed about the situation I'm in because I have it so good if that makes sense?\n\nSorry if this sounds so repetitive.

Some serious self-reflecting illustrated that I binge when I'm stressed or tired, I justify myself with this reasoning (food is my comfort/reward) even if binging makes me loathe myself afterwards. Self-observation made me understand what are my spesific cues for overeating. Mindful eating made me more aware of the eating rhytm suitable for me. \n\nSo, I have now reached a whole week without binging. This may not sound big, but I haven't achieved this before and I don't think with my previous state of mind I would've been able to. Not that I was very aware what I was doing to myself either. But for the last week I've tried to show myself love and caring. I acknowledge that some things cause me stress and I'm allowed to feel so. I know thoughts like \"I need some time for me\", \"I deserve a break\" or \"I'm just so tired I wanna forget everything\" are going to urge me to eat.\n\nI have a meal plan for the whole month, I buy groceries for one week at a time. I eat 1200 kcals a day and 5 meals a day [200-300-200-300-200 seems to be working for me]. All is pretty healthy, but I'm quite relaxed about it. And seems like my hypothyroidism meds are kicking in and lessening my tiredness and anxiety. Sidenote: 1200 may sound a bit low but I'm barely 5ft and trying to lose weight (have a lot of extra) so it's really not.\n\nDuring this week my in-laws were visiting, we currently have a strained relationship so I was really stressed for a couple of days. As soon as they left, I felt the need to eat and not just anything, but something really fatty, salty, unhealthy crap. I was almost giving in, in my mind I had already decided to get pizza or kebab and a chocolate dessert or so, all that would've been over 3000kcals and I know that I would've gulped it all up in one go (really, for someone as little as me I can eat a terrible amount of food in one sitting).\n\nThen, I don't even really know what happened. I thought that even though I feel really bad about the awkwardness b/w me and in-laws, I actually don't have to feel guilty about it, it's really not my fault. With that thought I prepared a nice dinner for hubby and kid and decided that I will eat together with them and if I still want pizza after that, I reconsider. Somehow, after eating a wholesome meal with my lovely family, the urge had passed. This was the 1st time I was able to resist the urge (earlier I was able to stop mid-binge but never really beat the urge). I wish I understood what caused this change or was it just all the things mentioned above.

Instead of being in it, i'm sat just looking at it. \n* Food creates deep set fog in the atmosphere, i don't have to focus on my surroundings, just on the inner experience.\n* Perhaps it's like an introverted manner of escapism.\n* Everything on the inside is stimulated... then everything on the outside is something i let whiz by.\n* Food feels like a baseline foundation of experience, then everything else happening, is just like dressing and fancy paraphernalia \n* I can't feel motivated enough to do the next activity until i'm fully satisfied with having eaten what i want for how long to whatever level of fullness... but oftentimes, once i've eaten in an addictive way like that, i need time to relax from eating food with relaxation... so there's all round less motivation for doing the rest of life. Perhaps that's to say, i'm just not as motivated to do life, whatever i have projected that to mean. Really, i project it to mean a very mundane sad lowly plane of existence.\n* Life is empty when i can't eat the foods that i feel a craving for, the one's that hit the right spot on those particular days.\n* Overindulgent food is not an occasional treat, it is the entire way of being and eating. Eating in a 'regular' way feels like being in a war zone where it feels like i'm adapting to scarcity.   \n\n\n&gt;**What do i believe about life to be eating this way?**  \n**What do i feel is missing, that food needs to be my crutch?**\n\nI feel i don't have what it takes to commit to this life with the right kind of energy. Food is used to take in energy, but it simultaneously mirrors the belief that i don't have energy, because it also saps me from my energy.   \nPerhaps i'm missing the sweetness of belonging, flow to life and energetic expansion. Maybe also somewhat restless and distracted, so food calms that down by melting me into the chaos without having to worry.\n\n&gt;**When did i start eating in a more addictive way?**\n\nIt started in my teens, when my dad would bring crisps and chocolate every night. I used to feel like i needed it every night. Soon, in my older teens to now it got worse when i had my own money. \n\n&gt;**What is the saddest thing about my life since that time, that has only gotten sadder?**\n\nI feel sad that... more and more i've felt less at home, more alienated, less relaxed where i am. The pressures of life have grown, the pressure to become independent financially and emotionally, to protect myself against hurtful people and circumstances, pressure to escape from conditioning that has kept my expression in a box... when and where can i settle is a big question, there just hasn't been a feeling of settling... life has become more about unsettling, for the better but in harsh ways which leaves me in the wind, alone, not knowing what next. \n\n&gt;**What image do i project when i think of myself as someone who is not addicted to food?**\n\nI see my child self. But at the same time, i have no idea what that viscerally feels like, to not care about food in the same way. I can only project that person from where i am now, and as my current self, the visceral feeling only brings up emptiness... like how can i enjoy life without being a foodie? It doesn't compute, how would my body feel? Wouldn't i just feel empty and hungry, a bit lifeless and low on energy. What else could i focus on with my mind, isn't that going to feel way less satisfying than being able to eat delish food. For some reason, the image on me being unaddicted to food, looks like someone in an apartment that has very minimalist decor. \n\nClearly i'm projecting a lack of colour and excitement when i think of myself as not being addicted to food.\n\n&gt;**Why is life without food so empty, lifeless, cold, boring?**\n\nI think i am left with my mind. I project a life where i'm living through my mind. If there's no pleasurable food... there's just this brain that moves through life on the intellectual place, interacting with boring intellectual details of life. It feels very left brain. In that sense, i can see the thing that would be missing is HEART. \n\nWithout food, heart is missing from my life. Food fills the feeling space, the one that buzzes with pink, the one that interacts as a feather from the sky, the saturation on a summer's day, the smile that radiates as a peach ripe from the tree\n\n&gt;**What tangible experiences from your life do you associate as having removed and dulled the heart from your life?**\n\nAgain, it's the same answers that comes from the sad question about pressures. My parents changed, home life changed, friends lost, hopes faded from how i viewed things as a child, i got more and more boxed in to live a certain way, dress a certain way. My ability to explore life the way i enjoy, i got more confined. I think i began distancing myself from people and becoming more introverted due to the inability to fully be me. The inability to enjoy shared experiences. There's too much dulling, restriction, dogma, disconnection, inauthenticity, lack of love and appreciation, joi de vivre, expression... \n\nThe conditions just don't feel right for a flower to bloom... but, some of that has transferred into my own state of mind. I feel conditioned to rely on food, rather than to live from my own heart. Maybe i need help with the beliefs my mind has about having to live from it. I do not want to live from the mind, in a mundane way. I want to let go of the tenseness it brings up. I want to let go of any parts of me that hold life down like an anchor. \n\nMaybe if i can introduce more freedom by living in the lightest ways possible, every moment being fresh. One thing i notice is my muscles are probably not as relaxed as they should be. That tells me i'm holding onto something. Perhaps i'm keeping my guard up in some way. I don't feel completely easy in letting go and living from a fresh canvas. \n\nIn that sense i limit my own feelings of possibility. Which only makes life feel like chewing on cardboard. \n\nI will give this openness to wonder and possibility a go. Instead of living from the mind and thinking that i know what to expect of each moment. Instead of measuring life with expectation. Instead of keeping tense muscles that seem to be unable to let go for the living. From this place, i need to learn to begin living. Maybe more colour will begin to seep through and cardboard will not be a thing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I didn't expect this post to turn into this, but it did so i'll share in case anyone finds it useful. I've done similar types of questioning before. I think if i continue doing inquiries, at some point i will find breakthroughs. But i like where this one went, and think i need to give it a try. Basically i'm going to try dropping living from places in my mind that feel limiting about my life in whatever ways show up moment to moment.** ", "subreddit": "FoodAddiction"}

It's not getting ANY better.", "author": "evanm137", "self_text": "Hi, so yesterday I posted this at another subreddit:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n\"Hi, I really apologize because I know that stuff like this probably gets asked a lot. I want to let it be known though that I am in the process of getting help for this and I've reached out to both the counseling center and doctor at my college. But I don't think my struggles are going to be completely resolved anytime soon.\n\nAnyways, for quick context, I'm a 5'11 male who is gay (reason for me telling my sexuality will come later in this), and I started a &lt;2000 calorie diet shortly after the new year started. I just wanted to lose weight and work on my body since that isn't something that I've really EVER done throughout my entire life. I was 188 pounds or so at the beginning of this. I've never really ever watched what I've eaten before throughout my life. So food has really been in control of me my entire life, and up until this new diet started I hadn't made any restrictions in what I've eaten.\n\nBut after I started the diet I quickly became consumed within everything about it. I was counting my calories ALL THE TIME and thinking about it SO MUCH, and after about 2 weeks or so since starting the diet, I started going to the gym very regularly, and now I go about 5 days a week at least, and if I don't go AT LEAST 4 then I feel extremely bad and guilty and like I've failed. Calorie counting, exercising, what foods I was eating, my weight, and when I was eating was just CONSUMING my life, and there were some days where I thought about stuff and anything related to that about 90% of the day. Over the coming weeks I just become more and more strict about things related to this, and there were days where I felt extremely guilty if I had eaten a lot in a short span of time, and if I was within 50 or so calories of my limit then I would feel just horrible and disgusted with myself that I let food control me that much to the point that I was that close to going over my limit. It, however, wasn't as bad as it has been the past week.\n\nThis past week things have just gotten unbearable. As a gay male, I feel the complete need to be skinny and make myself look better. I feel pitiful being gay and being even slightly overweight or having any belly fat. I feel like media presents gay men as either athletic with muscles or skinny with a slightly toned body. I've also has barely any luck on apps such as Grindr and Tinder, and it makes me feel like I'm not desirable to anyone. I went from 188 pounds to about 170 pounds, but I was stuck at about \\~ 170 for two weeks or so, and this got frustrating. I started thinking how I could continue to lose weight even though my belly fat which I hated was still there. I hated the way my belly looked in the mirror so much. I tried to eat even less, but nothing too extreme. However, about 2 weeks ago it was my birthday, so that night I went out and drank a lot and had a decent amount of food, and I ate whatever I wanted on my birthday. The week after that my university has this big yearly party where everyone drinks a ton. So after the day of that party I decided I would just eat whatever I wanted since I was so hungover. Then, following this I had just felt EXTREMELY guilty about eating whatever I wanted and letting food control me for so many days in the past couple of weeks, so I just spiraled out of control.\n\nThis past week I have been eating SO LITTLE. Some days as little as 600 calories, but I'd say on average about 900ish per day, but NEVER above 1000. And I have been seeing results on the scale and it's making me happy. As of now I am at 161 pounds, which is 27 pounds since I started, but my belly fat is still there and I'm still wanted to eat less and less because I want to look even skinnier. But my relationship with food is SO TOXIC. It's almost like food is my enemy now. I see it as bad. I'm restricting what I eat way more. I HATE sugar and seeing it on the nutrition facts, and foods that are high in fat scare me. Foods that are high in protein or high in fiber are the ONLY foods now that I don't have hesitation to eat. Protein bars, chicken, tofu, coffee, and vegetables are the only foods that don't make me feel much guilt after eating. I've had this EXTREME issue with food and wanting to work out more as well as go super low in my calories for about the past 6 days. That one day of eating whatever I wanted truly ignited this horrible streak of days where I've hardly eaten. The other day I ordered a salad and asked for light dressing, and I was disgusted by how much dressing they ended up putting on it and I picked apart the salad for about 5 minutes and removed the heavy areas of dressing and even got rid of a lot of the cheese in it. And even then I only ate like half of it and thought I had consumed way too many calories.\n\nThe other day I made my first purge attempt while I was at the gym, and I hadn't even eaten much that day. I just had this feeling of wanting to get food outside of my system because food is an enemy. I put my finger in the back of my throat and gagged once, but I got really scared and stopped and if I had actually thrown up while others were in the bathroom then I would've been really scared and embarrassed These thoughts all of the time are so exhausting and I want it to stop, but if I eat more then I'll feel bad, and while I would love to indulge I know I'll regret it and think I'm being unhealthy. I would not feel comfortable eating a full and complete meal in front of someone at this point. And I, myself am just eating in small bursts throughout the day and trying to stay around 800 calories despite the fact that I'm a big guy who is almost 6 feet.\n\nI just have this toxic feeling in my find for so much of the day and it's so horrible. The other day I ate so little ( \\~700 cals) and it got to the point where I felt dizzy and couldn't do my school work. But I feel accomplished when I eat very little because as long as that number on the scale goes down then I feel okay. I have a complete and utter attitude that for the rest of my life I NEVER want food to be in control of me ever again. I ALWAYS want to be in control of food, because food was in control of me for too long of a period in my life, and I feel like on the days that I almost went over my calorie limit, that the food was controlling me. I never ever want that.\n\nI spoke to the suicide hotline and it helped and he suggested I see a doctor as soon as possible, and I did and will be making appointments for this coming week.\n\nPlease let me know though if there's any additional help you can give. A response like \"just eat more\" absolutely won't do anything, because I legitimately will not eat more at this point except for occasions in which I'm drinking alcohol since I'm not the way I am while I'm sober. I hate being like this. I hate that my relationship with food has become so toxic, and I need more guidance. Please help. And do you think I have an eating disorder?\n\ntl:dr This past week I've been eating so very little (\\~800 cals per day and I'm a 5'11 guy), and I think I might have an eating disorder.

I just kind of stare at her like *you know* but I don\u2019t make a (purposely) negative reaction with my body, face, or words when she does it. So she might not know I dislike it... idk I just feel like I shouldn\u2019t have to clarify that to her though.\n\n\nShe is technically overweight, really not by a lot. She\u2019s very close to a healthy bmi and is losing weight at a healthy pace and as far as I know a healthy way. I\u2019m not going to share her stats but she\u2019s only 30~ pounds heavier than me, and taller.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t always known I had/have anorexia but I think I told her about a year ago? We\u2019ve been friends for 3. I kind of talk about it fleetingly and non-serious, but only about experiences from the past. She knows it started very young for me and was bad until sophomore year of highschool, 2 years before we met. And she\u2019s aware it\u2019s still an issue for me but I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve actively relapsed. Honestly though I\u2019m getting there sigh. Anyways.\n\nI\u2019m sure tons of you can relate to a similar situation. It\u2019s not easy to support a friend losing weight when it brings up a ton of hard feelings for yourself. But I think I\u2019ve been doing well. I congratulate her weight loss and just yesterday went with her while she shopped for fresh groceries. The trip was really fun! I got some food too even. Every time she mentions something even slightly indicating she could have a disordered mindset I check in and make sure she isn\u2019t feeling similar to how I did. \n\n\nThe recent example is her telling me that once she hits a certain goal weight (healthy range) then she could finally do \u2018something\u2019, and she would feel happy. Huge red flag for ppl familiar with eds lol. But not something that needs to be over analyzed either. I told her \u2018dude that\u2019s exactly what a lot of people with eating disorders say haha! Please don\u2019t put pressure on yourself like that\u201d and just generally letting her know it\u2019s the route I went down and to just be aware of herself so she doesn\u2019t slip into anything. She told me she is okay though.\n\nBUT ughh went into one of her very common tangents again where she told me she watches mukbangs and anorexia videos to feel disgusted and not eat. I didn\u2019t say anything, focused more on \u2018wow 10k calories in one mukbang? What did she eat\u2019 etc. then she started saying she\u2019s watching this one ana documentary 4 times and she loves a specific girl and wants to look like her. And she joked that when she hit x weight she would be able to start purging. \n\nLike dude. It\u2019s really hard to not cry just typing this. I feel so shocked that she uses this kind of language with me FREQUENTLY. I stayed silent. She texted me later that day to say \u2018I like taking tips from the documentary keke\u2019. Ignored because I can\u2019t fucking reply to that. What does she think I\u2019m going to say. What does she WANT me to say? She also talks about this positively, and not in a manner like she is worried she is developing habits.\n\n\nBut back to the on-going conversation she was having with me while I was dissociating from trying so hard not to let my emotions show lmao. It\u2019s hard to remember what happened now because I was so stressed and overwhelmed. She told me she wanted to watch the documentary with me. I laughed but said nothing. We were at work and our boss was near us. In earshot but not close enough that he was really actively listening. Well he left and I quickly took the privacy to comment to her \u2018haha yeahhh.... I can\u2019t watch ANY media about eating disorders it triggers me so bad and instantly lol\u2019. Some time had passed since her \u2018offer\u2019 so it wasn\u2019t a direct response. I thought that would be a pretty clear and soft \u201cno, and maybe stop talking about it\u201d\n\n\nNo she went on still. I really don\u2019t remember what she said now. But conversations like this honestly at least once a week. And so many fleeting comments from her about wanting to skip meals and being jealous of girls who can purge. I feel like at this point if I tell her how bad it hurts me to just hear her say that, intentionally, to me specifically, she won\u2019t care because so much time has passed. I\u2019m worried she might even yell at me or make fun of me for it. And not necessarily bc of her personality, I\u2019m just very nervous. I feel wrong for not telling her sooner that it hurts. I don\u2019t ever want to tell her. \n\nI\u2019m a really strong believer in not holding onto a grudge or anything when a person hurts you and you do not make it clear you were hurt. You can start making negative judgements if they continue to do it after they see the hurt on you. I haven\u2019t made it clear to her. But I am so hurt she would even think it\u2019s okay, multiple times. It\u2019s my fault though because I\u2019m not telling her.\n\nI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m just so afraid lol\n\n", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I am short and this is a 24 BMI for me. Thing is, all the way through getting up to there and staying there, I was exhausted ALL the time. Physically, mentally fatigued and super exhausted and gloomy. I cannot even stress how exhausted I have felt, it's been extreme.\n\nWell recently I have been eating way more. I thought I was eating freely before, but it was like something clicked a few weeks ago, and I recognised I was ignoring quite a few hunger signals. I was mad, frustrated, terrified... but I dove in, and ate more. More than the meal plan from the hospital. It was a complete leap of faith, but I just wanted to see what life was like, not being overly hungry and not hesitating to eat.\n\nAnd I noticed I started to feel so much more energetic, and less gloomy, less distracted and more hopeful about life.\n\nLast week at my weight in, my weight was 57.3kg. I know this isn't all gonna be 'mass' weight, perhaps food or gas or water since I didn't eat THAT much more, but it was obviously a big step up. For some reason though, I looked at the gain and rather than freaking out I thought '... I dont want to change anything just yet. I've felt much too good'.\n\nAnd so I've carried on eating more, honouring every hunger signal without hesitation. Ate exactly what I've craved (which seems to be SUPER HIGH PROTEIN foods for some reason). And the energy just keeps on coming. Oh my god it feels so different. Before I would struggle to get out of bed and I had no clue it might be because I wasn't eating enough, because my weight wasn't going down and my weight was 'high', but now I've been eating more I feel so so SO much better.\n\nI feel guilty at the thought of pushing myself into the overweight BMI range but I can't deny... I think this extra energy is making it totally worth it. Something about it feels right, and healthier. Like a gut feeling. I just feel so much better. I feel like a few extra kgs for this sort of energy is a trade that is totally going to pay off health-wise in the long run. I will actually end up being able to be more active, and get stronger.

She knows I'm home for anorexia and that the protein bars are a huge part or my diet, and so I was a little irked that she would eat them.

Wait AT LEAST a half hour, but preferably more, because the motion will erode the enamel that's been softened by recent exposure to acid. Instead... \n\n- Swish your mouth with plain water as many times as you can stand, then suck on a mint or chew some gum. Salivary flow will help get protect your teeth from any remaining acid. \n\n- Buy a sensitivity toothpaste. Even if they aren't sensitive yet, someday I promise they will be if you don't protect your enamel with the right products. These are designed to protect your enamel better than others, and from my experience, they actually work. \n\n- Use a children's mouthwash. These have a much higher fluoride content (which is often entirely absent in regular mouthwashes). Fluoride is vital in protecting enamel from acid erosion. Since I started using it my teeth are wayyyy less translucent. \n\n- If you're comfortable doing so, tell your dentist. They can prescribe medical-grade products and insurance will most likely cover it. \n\n- Avoid binging on highly acidic things and/or very sugary things (though I know those are often the most tempting). The prolonged exposure (as binges generally last a while) can cause problems all by itself. \n\n- From a darling commenter- chew tums when you're done! It'll neutralize the acid.

I was a bit of chubby kid in grade school but found a healthy way to lose weight in high school. I was at a normal weight for my age and height and although I was still self-conscious of my weight and how I looked, I was still relatively okay with my body image. Before I went to college everyone I knew would joke about \"the freshman 15\" and telling me I was going to gain weight and for some reason that really scared me. My freshman year I ate healthy, I went to the gym, but I still ate the occasional junk food and felt okay about myself.\n\nThis year, though, I feel like I'm sliding down a slippery slope. The year started and I've been counting calories, and I know my intake is way too low. I work out at the gym for way too long doing way too much cardio and then I'll go back to my room and do more exercise videos. Some days I'll write out my planned meals for the day and all of the calories that they have and I don't go past that amount. I drink an unnecessary amount of coffee and call that meal because it has barely any calories. If I eat even the smallest bit of junk food, I'll end up almost in tears and force myself to go for a walk or go to the gym because I feel like I didn't deserve that. I've recently started looking at these scarily thin girls and thinking \"damn do I wish I looked like that.\" I feel like somewhere in the back of my head I know that I'm not fat and that it's okay to have some snacks or an actual full meal, but I can never bring myself to eat a healthy amount without feeling guilty or crying about it. I know I'm losing weight, but I'm still at a fairly healthy weight for my age and height, but I always say to myself \"just a few more pounds. Just lose a few more, you're still at a healthy weight, you can afford to lose a few more.\" And sometimes when people say they're concerned with how little I'm eating or how much weight I've lost, I almost enjoy their concern.\n\nI know this isn't normal, but I don't know how to help myself, or if I even want to help myself.

After several weeks of binge eating, my weight went up to 105. This past Friday my weight was 93.6, and today, after basically three days of consistent binge eating, my weight went up to 108. \n\nI really don\u2019t know what my \u201creal weight\u201d is but I do know that I\u2019m only having these extreme weight fluctuations because of how extensive my binges have been.\n\nI\u2019ve tried Prozac. It helped for a while, and then I had a Prozac poop-out. I have hydroxyzine which is to help me sleep, but it really does little to help me stay asleep-so that hasn\u2019t helped me with the middle-of-the-night binges. Then I was put on Luvox, which is supposed to help with my obsessive tendencies. Which is helpful, mainly because you can\u2019t be obsessing over things when you\u2019re fucking sleeping all the time. \n\nI begged and cried and my psychiatrist gave me 10 10-mg Vyvanse capsules. She said that was basically all she would be giving me. And I had the best fucking week I had in months. Unlike the 30-mg I was prescribed last year, this dose wasn\u2019t too stimulating, didn\u2019t affect my sleep, and did just what it needed to take away the obsessiveness around food.\n\nVyvanse is the only medication that has helped, but everyone thinks I\u2019m a potential liability and nobody will give me another script. I was so desperate I said I would take topirmate despite the hellish side effects. I\u2019m really at my wits end now. I\u2019m working with a therapist. I\u2019m doing what I can, but right now nothing is helping. It\u2019s so frustrating for me because I just want a Vyvanse script to get me to the end of the semester, when I plan on going into a residential treatment facility. I have people monitoring my weight regularly. But because I was given an AN diagnosis, nobody trusts me. I feel like people are forgetting that binge eating comes with its own heath issues, outside of just weight gain. I have gastroparesis which was at first said to be mild, but seems to be getting worse. I\u2019m always tired. My stomach hurts. I vomit randomly throughout the day, sometimes in the middle of the night, which has been doing wonders for me. My favorite was when I ran out to puke during my therapy session. \n\nI swear one of these days I\u2019m going to suffer from a gastric torsion because I won\u2019t be able to stop eating. What\u2019s worse-an acute gastric emergency, or a risk for triggering more weight loss? I don\u2019t see why this is never taken into consideration. It\u2019s just \u201cyou can\u2019t be trusted with Vyvanse, you\u2019ll just abuse it to lose weight.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t really just run-of-the-mill overeating. I thought taking out all the food in my dorm room would help, but since I have access to some basic things like oatmeal, syrup, and hot chococolate, it hasn\u2019t been enough. There\u2019s nothing quite like shoving two packets of dried oatmeal with a packet of syrup into your mouth at four in the morning.

You don\u2019t work out!\u201d\n\nYeah, I don\u2019t, because my nutrionist recommended that I shouldn\u2019t until I get my calories to a better spot. The shakes are so I can down some fucking calories in the morning and function during labs.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah, haha, I just use em as breakfast.\u201d\n\n\u201cUgh, gross! Why?\u201d\n\nBecause :) my :) stupid :) stomach :) can\u2019t :) handle :) a full :) breakfast :)\n\n\u201cOh, yknow, morning labs are rough enough as it is. I get to sleep in instead of making breakfast.\u201d\n\nJust, fuuuuck dude, it\u2019s already embarrassing enough that I\u2019m such a baby about breakfast. The shakes are a huge milestone for me, especially with how consistently I\u2019ve been using them!! This just made me feel bad. Guess he won\u2019t be invited next time...\n\n", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I wasn\u2019t really counting calories just eating less. I noticed I had issues with overeating and couldn\u2019t control this. To this day I cant stop and put my fork down. I know it\u2019s wrong to keep eating but in my mind I find excuses like \u201cthere is just a bit left\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t waste it\u201detc. I was obese for most of my life and ate all what was in front of me. I want to overcome this. \n\nThis has slowly driven me to self hatred and anger at myself on how to control this. I\u2019ve tried meditation which doesn\u2019t work for me (yet) and also have tried smaller portions and weighing and also got a food timer. \n\nI\u2019m currently labelled anorexic and are several kgs underweight. I am terrified of eating and hate cooking. \nI stopped as it was overwhelming for measurements, weighing, planning... figuring out cooking times... finding equipment... I can chop.. not enough equipment.. I get overwhelmed very easily. I tried overweighing on scales as I was afraid. \n\nWell I lost weight so it worked. \n\nI have a set diet I\u2019m trying to achieve in my mind of a wfpb vegan , oil free, additive free.. soy free..etc on and it goes and fruit but picking this diet in my mind gives me a sudden panic moment where I freeze, have gut pain and can\u2019t make a clear decision. I had to cut dried fruit as I read it\u2019s bad and I found I couldn\u2019t control myself with it. I panic at making sudden choices when asked what food I want.. like today my mum asked me how I wanted my apple and is aid normal and she said without skin or skin and I said skin as in my mind I wanted the pleasure of the skin which is more calories. I measure my soup, my water for cups of tea even. I want to make salads but something about it repulses me and I don\u2019t fight thst sudden pain in my head and panic over making a decision. I fight it when eating a meal and it wins. I fight it with every food and overeat. So I compensate for my self hatred by eating less the best I can and weighing. I hate weighing. I hate it. I can\u2019t stand doing this all my life. I can never figure out calories (maths are so hard for me) and I just can\u2019t figure out portions.. it seems so minimal for a human being and makes me feel sad and unhappy but I want to achieve this perfection. It angers me I am against little portion sizes. I don\u2019t know what to do or what is wrong with me. I want to beat this demon! I want to eat small portion sizes and do what is for my body energy levels. I\u2019m frustrated my bad side inside me doesn\u2019t like this. The greedy side of me that overate and ate rubbish. \n\nI\u2019ve been on fasts, tried vomiting and restrict the best I can using my kitchen scales\n\nI mostly eat weetbix, almond milk, banana (under half), apple, dried fruit (used to), bought soup (I microwave it) and rice cakes. That is my diet. Doesn\u2019t involve cooking or weighing (much). I sometimes eat a carrot or celery. That has been my diet for months now. \n\nI lost over half my weight since October 2017. I noticed around last year around.. July I found myself finding \u201cnew numbers\u201d to reach... new goals for my weight. I feel proud when I see how much I weigh and see my ribs. I love it. I\u2019m trying to battle my hatred of healthy eating in my mind. I\u2019ve tried perfecting myself.. I even want to throw out a parfait ornament I have and keychain but can\u2019t somehow bring myself to do it as they are beautiful and cost a lot. But I deeply want to I just can\u2019t when I see them. I also removed myself from several food fb groups. I\u2019m trying to grt courage to throw them out. \n\nI have palpitations, space out... low blood pressure... weakness and other symptoms.. I have stomach pain after all I eat.. I haven\u2019t had a period since last year. ... I\u2019m exhausted and can barely sleep. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m supposed to go to hospital if I get too bad but I\u2019m scared when forced a meal. My mum presented me with celery and carrot recently and I panicked and tried making my own portions and ended up throwing it away. At hospital I went for another reason recently and ate up the whole meal I was given (first meal since last year). I felt guilty and tried restriction the next day. \nI am on waiting list for some public therapy but because I\u2019m in NZ it\u2019s limited for support.. someone told me 3 month wait.

This study aims to identify specific styles of coping which prove to be effective at decreasing the impact of anxiety and depression in people with diabulimia. These co-occurring problems can make recovery intensely difficult, so identifying more effective coping styles may lead to more successful treatment strategies.

Doesn't matter if it's vegetables or junk, I will be eating it. I don't even feel hunger anymore just impulse. And then there's state #2: the actual binge state, where I feel like I need to eat right this very second and I can't think about anything else. The thing about the second state (binge state) is that it's actually withdrawal from state #1. It's not withdrawal from food, it's withdrawal from the feeling of being numb. I am addicted to numbing myself out. But I'm trying something new right now: if I feel the urge to graze or binge, I try instead to force my withdrawal to come instead and to power through the binge need. This is because the faster I start my withdrawal, the faster I become un-addicted to binging.\n\n- if I'm planning on ending binging, it means I'm planning to end feeling numb all the time. This requires me to kill all other sources of perpetual numbness from my life, aka the rest of my numbness addictions, or all the things I would do instead of binging that would numb me instead of food. This includes internet consumption (YouTube, TV shows, Reddit) and shopping (both buying and pointless times when I go to the store).

Sometimes I want to binge, but I\u2019m usually able to distract myself and remember that I am in control. Which proves that I\u2019m finally dealing with the root triggers of my eating disorder.   \n\nHowever, yesterday felt like a breaking point. My period is late (just because it\u2019s irregular I\u2019m not pregnant) and I have been pms-ing like a ticking time bomb if that even makes sense. \u201cI\u2019m happy, I\u2019m sad, I\u2019m depressed, I\u2019m too skinny, I\u2019m too fat, too muscular, too ugly, beautiful, I want cookies, I don\u2019t want cookies, etc...\u201d \n\nAll of these negative and intense emotions left me in a bit of a panic yesterday. And the urge to binge was less of a \u201chey we go eat something to feel something\u201d and more \u201ceat, eat, there\u2019s a hole inside of you that you can never fill. All the exercise in the world will never leave you satisfied with life or body because you are alone and the only thing that you have is food. Go eat dry spoonfuls of everything in the cupboard and don\u2019t bother your mom because she\u2019s trying to rest. You thought you had healthy coping mechanisms? Well ignore them. The future is meaningless.\u201d \n\nI started to believe it. for the first time in 7 weeks it seemed like the future didn\u2019t exist. All that existed was me in that moment of suffering. I held on as long as I could, even though I ate extra yesterday. After a small nighttime snack, I boiled some broth and took it to bed like tea to sip on. I decided that if it wasn\u2019t enough I would keep trying to fill the gnawing emptiness in my stomach with food, despite knowing that I was lacking energy, friends, and love. I try to tell myself \u201cno\u201d in these instances, but my rational voice was not loud enough. I struggled to tell myself \u201cno\u201d. \n\nI woke up this morning feeling tired, like I\u2019d been on a rollercoaster all night. And although I am proud I managed to keep myself from relapse, I\u2019ve seen a side of myself I\u2019ve never really had to face before. It scares me. \n\nWhat have I learned? I have to reach out to my family. They don\u2019t believe how serious this disorder affects me because I lost 80 lbs. My binges are not as huge anymore, and I am a healthy weight and enjoy exercising. This is because of how far along I am in recovery (Both from restriction and bingeing).  But ED voice tells me that I am not worth burdening my family. It is wrong. If I want to succeed I have to keep helping my family understand! I have to reach out when I need help. No one could do this alone. All of my progress could slip if I start ignoring healthy coping mechanisms again and give into the compulsions.\n\nPlease do not let your disorder bully you into silence. You deserve help. You deserve support. I believe in you. It gets better. If you can make it through your darkest night, it won\u2019t seem so bad next time around. \n\nThank you so much for reading my vent.

My mind morphs the initial idea of 'If you eat this you'll gain weight,' into 'you should have something healthier instead', which makes it difficult to figure out how to react to it. I want to be balanced in my eating, and honestly, I have been. I get in my fruits and veg, I don't snack mindlessly, and I honor my hunger/respect my fullness.

When I first moved up here a few months ago she was trying to lose weight, mainly through intermittent fasting (only eating dinner, although she didn\u2019t follow this every single day). She had discussed this with her doctor, I know IF can be healthy (physically and mentally) for some, for some it isn\u2019t. At this stage I wasn\u2019t concerned for her, my boyfriend voiced concern at the fasting but had never looked into it (I had as at times I do it as well but not as much as my housemate does).\n\nShe has lost weight since then and is quite happy about it, lately she\u2019s bringing it up quite often in various ways about how much she\u2019s lost/ the clothes sizes she\u2019s gone down/ peoples comments on her weight. She was probably over a \u201chealthy weight\u201d when she began based on something like BMI, and now would be considered a \u201chealthy\u201d weight. It seems like she\u2019s also losing quite a lot of hair lately (beyond what she, and myself, would usually shed over the house).\n\nI know these factors alone don\u2019t point directly to an ED, however my boyfriend and I are a bit concerned, something of a gut feeling. I honestly don\u2019t think she has one, but maybe is heading towards it? I know signs and how to help, but only really when it\u2019s pretty pronounced. Was wondering if anyone has any advice on things to watch out for, or other early warning signs?\n\nAgain I hope this is ok, and thank you in advance for any help anyone has", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

Yesterday, I had no urge to binge which is very uncommon for me. I\u2019m off of work on Tuesday and Wednesday so yesterday I just laid around and watched tv. Usually, I would eat my way through my fridge and food cabinet but yesterday -all- (still a little more than I\u2019d like but it\u2019s a process) I ate was 3 scrambled eggs, a chicken breast, two packs of fruit snacks and 3 handfuls of cashews. I also drank roughly 94 oz of water which is really good for me. Today, I am challenging myself not to eat any of the unhealthy snacks that are available at my workplace. I work a 14 hour shift of doing a whole bunch of nothing. Usually by the 10-12 hour mark I give in and eat something unhealthy. I am going to drink a bottle of water before I eat anything today. \n\nA big part of this for me is weightloss. I\u2019m 5\u201911\u201d, 250 pounds.

What's helped me with bingeing", "author": "newusernameisbetter", "self_text": "Apologies if this breaks rules? I'm new to the sub but I have seen others posting about what helped them. I have no idea if this will help people, maybe it won't I know it's all highly specific, and I certainly don't want to pretend that I am \"fixed\". I feel like this will always be a thing that I have to be aware of, maybe it just gets easier, or whats that saying ? \"It never gets easier, you just get stronger\". \n\nMaybe this isn't covered in the wall of text below, the reason I posted on instragram is because I'm currently posting literally everything I eat on my stories. It's made me have to give less of a shit about what people think, and also think about what I'm eating, I'm not gonna lie or hide shit.. so if I binge it is going online. But I also wanted to be very clear with people that me worrying about eating a chocolate bar isn't because of what it is, it's because of what it could mean for me. Since actually posting on a super public forum, it's like a relief.. like my dirty secret is out now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Full comment with a few edits specific to this sub:** \n\nWell shit.. I literally just posted a thing on my insta about this today. Being as public as possible is A BIG SCARY deal for me.. I've mentioned it in passing to friends, and my partners knows about it, but I've never really gone into it properly and I've never told people about the full on details about it. I absolutely joke about it, pretend I'm proud of much food I can eat etc. This is a defense mechanism. This is gonna be long....\n\nAs I said on the insta, binge eating shouldn't be confused with over indulging. This isn't the same as eating a bag or dorritos or a pizza and thinking \"well shit, I shouldn't have done that\". For me it has controlled me for a long time. I have cancelled plans with friends, made myself too ill to go to work the following day, hidden food, hidden wrappers, avoided people I see in shops, gone to separate shops to get multiple things. I've hidden it very well for years, I think age 10 was the first time I remember bingeing. I feel like I'm getting it more under control at the moment and it's gone from being a weekly occurrence to maybe every few months and it's to a much lesser extent now a days. I'm not saying it's gone. It's not.. I can just tell when it's coming on and try to tackle it a bit better.\n\nThings that I have tried that help :\n\n**NOTE : These just helped me, I'm not saying they will help anyone else. Everyone is different :**\n\n* Therapy! If you can't afford that there is a great app call Pacifica, it is free, but you can pay. I do. I think it's worth it.\n* Reading : Brain over binge (also in podcast form), Never binge again, The Chimp paradox.\n* **Writing down what I'm eating when I binge!!** This is fucking hard. But you have to not care about the calories, or don't track the calories, just take a photo ,whatever. This is accountability with yourself. It's currently a little project of mine. I'm attempting to post everything **absolutely everything** I eat on instagram stories. It makes it harder to binge and I'm hoping once I break the habit it will become easier.\n* Tracking a lot of things, mood, alcohol, time spent with friends, productivity in work. I can do back and see what are my triggers (this is tracked through pacifica)\n* Telling someone the FULL EXTENT of it, my partner but it could be a close friend. The only way I could explain it to him is it's like an alcoholic but instead of being able to avoid situations with alcohol you still have to eat every day and it is everywhere. I tell him when I feel like I'm going to binge. It makes it that little bit harder. I don't think people really understood how much I was eating when I was doing this.\n* CBD oil, it doesn't help with the actual binge, absolutely helps with the anxiety or stressing about stupid things that triggers it.\n* Not allowing my brain to gloss over the why of it, not telling myself it's \"self care\" or it's normal. My brain is a little bollox and it's incredibly good at justifying why I get to this.. \"everyone does this\", \"you work out all the time\", \"you are't eating enough\" it's all bullshit to get me to give it the quick fix it wants.\n* Not beating myself up over it. Accept it happened. Move on. Don't restrict food afterwards.\n* I'm trying to re-frame thoughts like \"I deserve a treat\" with \"I deserve to treat my body well because it makes me feel good, fitter, stronger, faster and happier\".. so re-framing thoughts positively.\n* This is purely anecdotal, and highly not scientific and I don't think these things even do anything.. but I have noticed a link between when I take CLA supplements and not having craving as much. **NOT SCIENCE, THEY HAVE NO RESEARCH TO BACK THIS UP. COULD BE A PLACEBO.**\n* Not cutting out any foods. However!!! This is important. I am trying to cut out sugary, or junk food unless it's \"an experience\".. so an example : boyfriend brings from a fancy pastry.. treat.. that is together and lovely = good. Me eating a brownie at my desk in work cos I want it and I'm a bit stressed = bad.. not allowed. If I want dessert when we go out for dinner. Have it. Don't limit things.. this causes restriction -&gt; binge cycles. But make it a thing you will remember instead of some instant sugar hit just because you want it.\n* Booze is a huge trigger for me. If I drink the night before I make damn sure I eat something healthy before hand, and the following day I try to keep busy and get in some exercise cos I know I'm likely to eat more. I allow myself to eat more, but not binge.\n* If you feel it coming on, get busy, paint your nails, read, walk. Tell yourself that if you still feel like this in an hour (after tracking your feelings etc) you can go and buy the shit from the shop - side note.. don't keep shit in your house.\n* Meal prep!!!\n\n**Things I have tried that have not worked or made things worse :**\n\n* Allowing myself treats if it fits my calories. This worked for me for a while and I believe it's absolutely a valid method, I hope to go back to something like that, but for me it's a slippery slope. I've edited this to allow myself things if it's an \"experience\", covered that above.\n* Cutting out entire food groups. It's not sustainable.\n* Overly restricting calories (this may not be applicable to this sub, this was originally posted in a women's fitness sub), I tend to restrict heavily Mon - Thurs to allow myself a bank for the weekend. This only works if you aren't bingeing 6000 cals on the weekend which I easily can. If your calories are too low you will crack eventually, then you will binge, then you will repeat.\n* Trying to exercise my way back from a binge - this is not gonna work.\n* Constantly focusing on losing weight. Maintenance for a while will help, while you work through this stuff.\n\nI think it's generally regarded by a lot of people as not a thing too. Which makes it even easier to hide. Everyone eats too much every now and then (this is not what bingeing is in my head), I would br happy if I was at that point. Also when you work out 6 days a week, are an average weight and look \"fit\" no one bats an eyelid if you want to eat a lot of food. Like.. people think I'm disordered if I turn down food.. when in fact it's the complete opposite.. that is me trying to save myself a whole cycle of bingeing. The public view of it is interesting.\n\nPhew... so long!! Sorry!!! This is something I've been thinking about a lot recently, and I finally feel like I'm getting a bit of a handle on. As I said above these are just my experiences.. maybe it seems a bit full on.. maybe it sounds like you. No idea. Hope it helps though.

Thinking about/planning a binge is when your dopamine is firing.  Contrary to popular belief, dopamine is not at its peak when you\u2019re engaging in the pleasurable activity.  It\u2019s at its peak in the planning/anticipation phase, which when you think about it makes sense from an evolutionary perspective.\n\nThe reason you keep binging past the point of pleasure is\n\n1) Your dopamine fueled planning told you it would be the most amazing thing ever and you continue to seek for that amazing feeling.\n\n2) Since your dopamine was at its peak during the anticipation phase, that means once you start binging (once you receive the reward your body craved), dopamines job is done and begins to diminish.  You are still seeking that rush and are trying to find it in the food, but it will never be there.\n\nThat\u2019s why you\u2019re left wanting and keep eating past the point of full.\n\nOnce you acknowledge that the peak of exciting and feel good chemicals is likely at checkout in the grocery store or driving up to your home, it makes the binge event a lot less exciting.\n\nYour pleasure comes from planning the binge, not the binge itself.  The act of binging is just the result of your primitive brain responding to the dopamine fueled decision.\n\n\n", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

My problem wasn't worth it. But I know that sharing your problem with others can ease the pain a little. So, I'm gonna try this.\n\nI'm 21 years old and a college student. My obsession with food actually started when I got into college. Before that I wasn't actually obsessing over the tiniest thing I put in my mouth. In college I unfortunately started to compare myself, my body with others. Especially with my skinny friends. I always thought 'if I had a body like them, i would be loved more.' And this thought is still on my mind. For example a boyfriend. I literally have no trace of love in my life. But how can i expect people to find me attractive while i don't, right? I have zero confidence with my body. And most of the time, this turns into personality issues. I even stopped dancing because I hate how my body looked in the mirror next to others. And dancing has always been my biggest passion and dream. The fact I can't even look up in the mirror kills me.  I'm actually an avarage person in weight, i can even be considered as a little chubby (even most of the people think i'm not chubby at all). This comparison of me with others is really destroying me. I stay away from a lot of social events, i get really angry time to time just because i'm feeling particularly bad about body on that day. I tend to binge eat whatever my roommate isn't the room. Because i'm ashamed of eating large amounts of food when she's around. And the fact that she eats whatever she wants whenever she wants drives me crazy. Don't get me wrong, i absolutely love her but i just can't stand it. And like i said, i can get agressive because of it. I don't even know anymore if i'm a bad or a good friend. \n\nIf you're curious, I haven't made myself puke yet but i tried it twice after eating like an animal. I tried but i failed. \n\nI think I need help but i don't know if i'm really worth it.

I still love her, at one point I wanted to spend my entire life with her, but I can't see that anymore. Sometimes I wonder if I'm just with her because it's familiar and I'm scared to be single again or if it's because I really love her. I just don't know anymore.I feel restless and bored, and I keep looking at other people in a way I shouldn't. I dont have any romantic interest in them, I just want attention. I want some sort of validation and comfort that she just can't give me right now.\n\nI know this is most likely my ED talking, that it's the part of me that wants any attention, even if its unhealthy and will only make me worse. I know that it's my depression sucking the life out of me and what makes me happy, but I can't help but feel so drained whenever I have to talk to her. My replies are shorter, our conversations are awkward and stiff, and I just can't bring the same spark I once did to our relationship. \n\nThe thing is, I really *really* don't want to tell her about my ED. I'd honestly rather die. I'd rather binge on nothing but deep fried Twinkies for 5 days straight or be back at my high weight. I know she'll tell my parents, and I can't stand the thought of seeing her in pain because she feels like it's her fault (she thinks most of my pain is her fault. It's not, she just feels responsible for everything). She's still very much in love with me, and it hurts me to lie to her. \n\nIt's all further complicated by the fact that she's overweight. I'm not saying that to be mean, she calls herself fat and is mostly body positive about herself, she loves reclaiming the word and encourages me to use it to describe her. But sometimes she comes to me crying about her weight and it's almost too much for me to handle some nights. She talks about losing weight and feeling too fat and I can't help but feel so fucking guilty because I weigh a solid 20-25 kg less than her.

I think people in general have been turning to food for their dopamine fix cos we as a society have put less focus on having hobbies that are completely detached from the internet (I say as I obsessively check reddit every hour lol)\n\nanyways, here\u2019s the list, would like other suggestions   \n\n* embroider emo quotes onto my clothing \n* go do an errand that\u2019s not grocery shopping (my fav and least fav)\n* do some pottery/ceramics \n* write down physical lists of things i have to do instead of making the list on my phone \n* tidying up \n* baking a bunch of treats, but then giving it away to coworkers/friends/neighbors \n* going for a walk with my camera with a specific destination in mind (like maybe a mile or 2 away), taking a picture and then choosing another destination and repeating \n* physically writing in a journal (this one is hard, because literally the fastest way I can convey my thoughts is by typing on my phone, but that\u2019s over so quick) in a coffee shop so I feel like A Writer and ordering a tea (0 cals) so I\u2019m not just a freeloader \n* smoking weed \n* practicing guitar \n* trying to do some sort of vaguely athletic activity (longboarding/skateboarding/yoga etc.) \n* making collages out of old magazines (and if they just so happen to feature some thinspo......\ud83e\udd2b)\n* scrubbing something thats dirty and making it clean \n* taking a shower \n* cutting my bangs or trimming my split ends \n* looking up dream apartments in my area \n* browsing ebay or online stores \n* responding to texts of all the people i ignore \n* watering + repotting my plants \n* snorting coke tbh but that gets expensive \n\n", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Why can't I do that?\n\nI'm still mulling over everything I did wrong on the test, all the performance mistakes, all the fucking gaps in knowledge that docked me points here and there and what started out as a fascination with math is being overshadowed by obsession very similar to the disordered eating habits I've accrued in the last 10 years. I cried for days, plugged grades into the grade calculator and did absolutely nothing but scream at myself every day for being a huge fucking idiot. \"Any dumbass can get a B on a multivariable exam. That's not good enough. You're fucking smarter than that.\"  (also bombed a linear algebra test, so that didn't help.) Even typing this now I'm full of shame even though I'm also full of shit. I can't stop thinking about my grades. I feel like I don't deserve anything good and I'm stupid and I'll never be like the woman who calculated pi to a trillion digits as busywork. \n\nI can't just study for a love of math and trust that everything will be fine, because I have absolutely no faith in my ability to do math or succeed.

I want to have this exact number of A's on each transcript because it's aesthetically pleasing. Blah Blah Blah.

If fat is something to fear, something horrible, then you will always have a top line where recovery stops and relapse begins, for example, if you recover and gain weight but say I won't allow myself to ever fall in the overweight category because fat is bad, then you will always have restriction and your ED in your back pocket, waiting to come out when you hit a weight that makes you 'fat'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; I'm not good at making clear points but I refuse to use the word fat as a curse word anymore, it is just an adjective, it is one trait that makes up a person who is full of talents and love and caring and goals and so much more than their outer appearance.

She put her hands on me, which distressed me, and then she said 'just don't let it get to you', which just made me feel like I was crumbling into pieces. So I cried even more and she lost it.\n\nI'm not allowed to express my sadness because people hate it when I make them worry about me. If I self harm my mother will never let me go out of her sight - she will lock me in the house and even sleep next to me in my bed even though I am 20 years old. I can't talk to anyone because they just get angry at me and then I feel worse. I can't even cry anymore. My mum got mad at me for crying, so I went into the shower to do it, but she could still hear me and barged in while I was naked to tell me that if I didn't stop she would call the police and make them section me. She asked me if I had hurt myself and I told her I hadn't. She shouted 'GOOD - DON'T YOU DARE'. I'm not allowed to be affected by this email in the slightest.

Also..this might be a rant", "author": "eray1228", "self_text": "Im stuck alone today pondering and just needed a place to think this through. Perhaps one of you lovely people can provide feedback or insight. \n\nI feel strange considering this. I'm probably fine but, I cant stop wondering now because of last night. \n\nI've recently started the Keto diet (low carb, high fat) you've probably heard of it. I started  because I wanted to lose weight fast and I enjoy how I feel when on it; I sleep better and have more energy. Ive done this before. In fact, I've tried many diets before including plant based, fasting, calorie cycling. etc. I've used supplements and detoxes, etc. I've noticed lately I'd been eating less and less like maybe 600 calories in a day or 400 on a low day, maybe less on days I forget to eat. When posed with what to eat I feel overwhelmed. I've been avoidant about food and feel stressed out eating. I find myself uncomfortable eating and enjoy the emptiness. All of which I know isn't healthy. I kept ignoring thinking \"I'm just busy, I'll get around to eating more when I'm not so busy\" but last night my stomach hurt badly and I threw up on a basically empty stomach. It caught me off guard. I've also been tired and muscles have been hurting for a while. Lots of headaches and anxiety. I attributed it to poor sleep. \n\nI started reflecting and realize I do this in cycles for like 2-4 months and will lose 20lbs or so fast and then take a break for a month or two, gain some weight back, and come back to a restrictive diet. Been doing it for a few years. Never got to the point where I threw up but, I've definitely ate very little for an extended period of time. \n\nIn the past, I have attributed these diet spell obsessions to my hypomanic and manic symptoms from my bipolar (I got obsessed with detoxing and spent thousands of financial aid trying to do so) but, I'm definitly not having a mood episode of any sort now, well I dont think anyways.  I've had a therapist for many years and a husband whose very mindful of me. To top it off, I myself, am a therapist surrounded by other therapists at work. So, I feel like someone would have recognized this by now. \n\nYet, I seem to get like this regularly and have been for years. And now I'm too anxious to eat and despite knowing I should, I dont want to. I've been trying convince myself all day to just eat something. All I seem to manage lately are small protein shakes but, the thought makes me feel sick. I jokingly think to myself \"eventually I'll snap and just start eating and drinking whatever I want for a couple months anyways\" but, that stresses me out too and causes more fear. \n\nI'll bring this up to my therapist next week and talk to my husband. Maybe I'm overanalyzing myself. If it was serious I feel like one of my family, friends, or many doctors and mental health professionals in my life would have noticed. \n\nAlso, I'm at a normal BMI and fluctuate within the normal realm so, I know I wouldn't really be considered super serious anyways. I also work out regularly. The large focus on my mental health treatment has always been on the Bp1. I talk about diets frequently but, no one ever seems faced by it nor concerned when I lose weight fast; usually they are happy for me. Am I overreacting? ", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

I just wanted to share what things seemed to be helpful for him:\n\n- seeing a psychiatrist specialized in cognitive behavioral therapy and eating disorders\n- reading and trying to implement the book \u201cThe Joy of Half a Cookie\u201d \n- signed up for vegetarian nutrisystem and adding his own protein (chicken, beef, beans). \n- daily meditation\n\nThe psychiatrist got him started. The book has become his go-to and he raves about it a lot. As for nutrisystem, he realized half his problem is needing food on-demand because of his insanely busy schedule. Nutrisystem does that for him.

I\u2019m not really sure if this is the greatest place to ask about this, but I thought I\u2019d give it a try. \n\nI\u2019m currently 15 (F) and 5\u20192. I developed an eating disorder about 6 months ago (restricting) and lost my period; my hair has also thinned out *drastically*. There\u2019s also been other side effects but I\u2019m sure you know the whole shebang.\n\nOnly recently (3 months ago?) did it turn into a binge/restrict cycle, one I\u2019ve only recently been trying my hardest to break out of. I\u2019ve gained about 13 pounds; however, I had a horrible binge week that lasted about 14 days, so SOME of that could be water weight. \n\nMy question is: did this stunt my growth? I have a twin brother who is currently 5\u20196, while I\u2019m only 5\u20192. I know that women aren\u2019t usually as tall as men, but this is a pretty big difference. My dad is 5\u20197 or 8 and my mom is 5\u20191. Did I just lose the genetic lottery, or do you think this is a side effect of the restricting? Once I recover, is there any chance I\u2019ll grow taller?\n\nIt\u2019d be greatly appreciated if anyone had some insight on this. :) Again, I\u2019m not sure if this is the place to ask, but I thought I\u2019d give it a shot.", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

I'm 23, F, and have dealt with eating disorders since I was 15. I've had anorexia, orthorexia, and binge eating disorder. I haven't had a normal relationship with food since I was younger and it eventually developed into an ED. \n\nI was diagnosed with IBS a few months ago, probably around August of 2018? I can't exactly remember the date but I had to cut down my food choices a lot due to the pain that a lot of food caused my stomach. This led to some subconscious restricting. I lost 25 pounds and I got lots of compliments on my weight loss. It took everything in me to not explain, \"I have IBS, which means I can't eat a lot of things I used to enjoy. This has caused me to spiral back into my ED behavior.\" Not to mention I have emetophobia and the fear of vomiting kept me from eating. Both my phobia and IBS were good excuses until my mother kept bringing it up. She doesn't have a very...good way of talking to me about my ED though. She gets upset very easily and it just keeps me quiet. I wouldn't eat. I would lie. I could calculate the numbers without a second thought. I needed to control some aspect of my life. \n\nFor the last week, I have devoted myself to recovery. I feel like I'm learning to walk again and learning to trust my body and heal a very broken part of my brain. I thought I was recovered but it was more of a, \"Okay, how can I live and just fit my anorexia into my life so no one notices?\" I wasn't ready for my body to start changing. I wasn't ready for my anxiety to keep me from drinking coffee with almond milk creamer. I have to keep assuring myself that my body needs food to live and to get a period every month. I'm gunna take my anorexia and just whack the shit out of it like it has done to me. I've had an eating disorder that's been active on and off for 8 years. I'm putting a stop to it. \n\nI am posting this here so I can get support from others who are in the same boat as me. I have a wonderful partner who does what he can to help but he is busy.

People who develop purely restrictive eating disorders don't lose all their current weight to become under BMI 17.5 overnight.\n\nAnd what about people who recover, and relapse? They could be purely restrictive within their eating disorder, but gain weight with recovery, and then relapse. Their eating disorder could be chronic. You're still 'struggling with an eating disorder' if you're swinging between recovery and frequent relapse. You don't suddenly stop having a purely restrictive ED because you managed to gain weight through recovery habits.\n\nI had the same *purely restrictive* eating disorder at BMI 37 as I did at BMI 17. I didn't binge, I didn't purge, I didn't have BED. I restricted, constantly, full stop. I had it for nigh on a year and a half before I became underweight. I wasn't obese/overweight/normal weight for so long because I was binging and purging or something, but because *losing weight takes time* even though I had developed a purely restrictive eating disorder.\n\nI get the reason for pointing out that you can only be *diagnosed* with typical anorexia under a certain weight, because that's just true. Thankfully, we have OSFED - atypical anorexia for the purposes of catching it and treating it before someone hits below that BMI.\n\nAnd whether its a fat or thin body, it's still the exact same eating disorder. It's anorexia. One is just caught earlier, mostly. And that's what makes it atypical, for some reason.\n\nBut whats with all these claims that people in larger bodies absolutely cannot *possibly* struggle with purely restrictive eating disorders? All these qualifiers to *excuse* their body type (\"Maybe they struggle with binging too!\"). Um no? Makes no sense that people suddenly want to skim over the well known fact that people don't just drop lbs of body weight overnight in any situation, the well known fact that the body only burns a set number of calories per day and it will take time to lose weight even if you outright stopped eating 100% completely.\n\nAnd in this day and age, where society is getting fatter and larger in general, of *course* people of higher weights can develop *purely restrictive* eating disorders and be struggling with them long term - As I did. It just takes them longer to lose the weight.\n\nidk guys its just super invalidating. I had the same eating disorder for a year and a half before I was underweight. I have struggles with the same eating disorder now that my BMI is in the healthy range after recovery. If I ever relapse into my original habits, it'll still be the same purely restrictive eating disorder even if my BMI is 24. And acknowledging and treating any eating disorder early is only for the best.\n\n*Edit: Thanks for the gold!

Because, let\u2019s be honest, there are a considerable amount of people \u2013 especially a considerable amount of celebrities that participate in disordered eating habits, however, you never see anyone speak out about their issues. Whenever they do, it\u2019s post-factum, once they\u2019ve decided to recover/have been recovered for a while. \n\nI wish people could talk about it openly, talk about their struggles while they\u2019re still present, and not have to literally make their own private communities (ed twitter, ed tumblr) and have to keep their social media accounts for these communities separate because they don\u2019t want their (assumedly) non-disordered friends finding out.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s also the issue of \u201cnormalizing\u201d eating disorders. Right now, the general public\u2019s understanding of them is more or less radicalized \u2013 an anorexic to them is a tall, hundred pound woman who doesn\u2019t eat ever, and is always hungry and therefore angry and depressed. Do you think if they found out just how many people are disordered without necessarily fitting into that stereotype, more people would want to \u201cparticipate\u201d? Especially if they found out how many (non-model) celebrities have eating disorders. Like, hey, I\u2019ll lose weight, and society won\u2019t  ridicule both me as a person and my life choices, seems like an alright deal.\n\nThe same way for example your stereotypical drug addicts are estranged from society, but there are so, so, so many people who are addicted to drugs all the same, just hide it well enough. There\u2019s no doubt that these people being able to speak out, being able to freely talk about the time they shot up some heroin in a public bathroom in the middle of a date would help these people feel more included, more accepted, and therefore make it a little more easy to heal.

I know I posted about this the other day, but it's still really bothering me. So my nutritionist is currently only allowing me to attend 4 barre (workout) classes a week because I have lost some weight since being in college due to my eating disorder. Normally, I attend 6-7 barre classes a week (I have an unlimited pass). I love going to barre; it gives structure to my life and helps me reduce stress. However, I do get very anxious when I cannot go and I always try to schedule plans around it. While I have been trying to be less rigid surrounding food, I still feel like I am a bit rigid surrounding exercise. That being said, I don't think it will be THAT hard for me to gain the weight my nutritionist is making me gain...? So, I feel like if I up my calories, I can go to barre more. But this is problematic because it's showing my obsessiveness over barre; it makes me so anxious to not go. What do you think I should do? Ignore what my nutritionist said and go to barre (which is not a very strenuous class for me at all) more and up my calories, or wait until my weigh-in next week with her to find out her opinions? I know that even if I did gain weight, I still feel very obsessive around exercise. I convince myself I'm not doing it for weight, but for fun -- even if that's not always true. Do you think it's better for me to keep taking some days off so I can become okay with not always working out? I just feel helpless here and would ***really*** appreciate any advice or insight. It makes me sad seeing my friends get to go to barre all the time and I just have so much FOMO and wish I could go with them -- both for the fact that it makes me feel good and that I want to be with my friends.

She is 13 and still lives at home. I live pretty far away, so I only get to see her about once a month. I'm her big brother and i'm in my mid-20s.\n\nShe has been periodically depressed in pretty much all of her life, probably because of our mother - our mother is a good person with a beautiful heart, but she has her own problems and she isn't really capable of raising children herself to be honest. I had (and have) a lot of problems myself, being depressed and feeling i wasn't good enough, but i've managed to learn how to control those feelings and turn them into what i would call my personal strengths. Since she was born i've tried to learn her how to do the same, while also using every opportunity to tell her that she's talented/good enough and that i love her - something that our mother hasn't really been good at telling us. \n\nWhen she was about 10 years old, she got an diagnosis for a special kind of arthritis, and the medicine she was prescribed caused her to gain a lot of weight. At the same time our mother was stressed out, so my sister mostly had unhealthy food such as pizza and other types of fast-food. \n\nIn the last year, my sister went from overweight to slightly underweight. At first, i thought it was a good sign; that she was starting to attend gym classes again and having a more active lifestyle. However, this weekend i noticed that she nearly doesn't eat at all. I managed to get her to eat something without forcing her, by giving her time and not making a big deal of it, and having some fun at the same time. However, what really got me worried was when she asked me to fix something on her phone, and the first thing that came up was a google search about \"how to throw up\". I acted like i didn't notice it, as i didn't know how to react. \n\nNow i'm here. I know it's different from person to person, but i really need advice about how to help her through it. As I mentioned, i live pretty far away as i study somewhere else, but i'm definitely willing to do whatever I can and take a break from other things in my life while I try to help her through it. I think this might be the first \"phase\" of an eating disorder, but i'm not sure. She isn't *really* underweight, but I see know that she might be good at hiding it with her clothes. \n\nSo - what I really need is some advice about how to help her. How should I talk to her about it? I mean, what is the \"first step\" towards getting her to realize that she isn't overweight, getting her to eat and most importantly - make sure that she knows i'm there for her? I have no idea which role she needs me to take, but i'm sure I have to do more for her than my mother is capable of.

He's so hot to me, in personality and body, but his appetite is infrequent, he's been underweight naturally most of his life, and he is trying to gain weight and muscle. But he literally eats less than me, a 5'3\" woman at a 20 bmi. He feels full on what barely satiates me. AND he lifts weights. I feel so gross eating more than him, but I know that if I restrict to match him, it can lead to relapsing for me. It's like, I'm torn between worrying about him (pretty sure he doesn't even manage to hit 1500 most days tbh) (but I mean he's lived this long so clearly it works for him and I shouldn't worry??) And wanting to be a know-it-all about nutrition and encourage him to eat in a way that helps him meet his goals and feeling jealous that it's so easy for him to just not care about food and I feel like my recovery is false because I'm so obsessed with his intake and can't stop. I know it's not my business what he eats and that it's my responsibility to deal with the feelings that arise when I eat and he doesn't. (He skipped dinner last night and breakfast today).\n\nI guess my question is, how do you all deal with the urge to obsess over others' intake and compare your own? Do you allow yourself to make comments when the urge to do so is burning you up inside? And how much emotional connection to food is appropriate--should I even want to enjoy it? I'm coming from more of a bingeing than restricting background, though I've done both. \n\nHow do I not let my ED history get in the way of this beautiful thing that could blossom? And am I crazy for being concerned about him even though he clearly doesn't have any emotional ED?\n\nAlso, I feel like I'm gaslighting myself about my appetite. Like, how can he possibly not be hungry when he needs more calories than me? Maybe I'm not actually hungry? What even is hunger? I definitely could skip a meal or two with him and be fine...but my therapist basically told me that I need to accept that I can't skip meals in the same way a diabetic can't--it actively worsens my health to do so, even if neurotypicals can do it fine.

I've done cutting and other forms of self harm and they blamed me for that.

I'm unable to go to a clinic at this point in time, but want to start recovery while I have the courage to do so. I have bouts of strong physical hunger where I start literally scavenging like an animal for food (or I start to breathe heavy and get really physically irritated) but that tends to come and go. I never feel full no matter how much I eat, and no matter how much I eat, no matter what I do, my thoughts tend to trail back to \"food\". And it's nothing in particular, I'm not imaging cookies or pizza or cake or whatever, my brain just goes back to very singular thoughts like \"food\" \"hungry\" \"Im hungry\" even when I don't physically feel so. I could gorge myself until I get what feels like a rock in my stomach and my brain will continue its mantra of \"food-food-food-food\". It's really weird, to be honest. However, I'm afraid I could actually bust my stomach open with that so I'm not sure whether I should give in to it or not.\n\nWhat form of recovery worked best for you (food wise)?

I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety as well as binge eating disorder and was put on antidepressants (lexapro) for the depression and anxiety.

My snacking has pretty much almost stopped and my binge eating episodes are non existent after 8 years of dealing with it. \n\n\nBasically my brain is getting the satiety signal and is not in overdrive for huge binges. I am sleeping a lot better too so do not feel the need to binge out of tiredness.\n\n\nI am not saying this is a treatment option for everyone but it was the last thing I thought would cure my BED (always thought I would take the vyvanse route and used to buy duromine to try tackle it with little success). If you have other mental health issues such as depression and anxiety it is really worth to get a mental health assessment and if antidepressants are recommended to you, you might find that your binge eating will decrease or stop. \n\n\nJust want people to know what has worked for me and what could be an option for others. Of course talk to your doctor but serotonin plays a huge role in our body and is pretty much involved in every process so having stable serotonin may improve issues with binge eating. \n\n\nTLDR: antidepressants unexpectedly completely eliminated my binge eating episodes  after 8 years of BED and might be worth a shot for some people out there!

I don't wake up immediately - I only wake up as I'm mid-way through choking on my own acidic bile. It's awful (but still the urge to binge wins over in the moment because all that matters is what I feel like *now*, not what will happen later...).\n\nBut, I've also had a pretty bad fever for the last week or so. I'm coming out of it now, but I've still got a sore throat and a bad cough. So this morning, not only did I wake up choking on my bile, but it had mixed in with the phlegm in my throat. I coughed for about 20 minutes before I got it all out and even then I could still feel my throat burning. It was absolutely miserable, possibly the worst sensation I've had in over a year.\n\nI guess no one needed to know any of this but it was so awful I felt like I wanted to share my pain. I don't feel up to cooking a big meal tonight but I've bought some chicken and some tinned peas so hopefully that stops me from binging tonight - and even though I said I don't always learn from the pain, I really don't want to experience that again so even if I do binge, I won't buy anything too carb-y or acidic.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

At age 15 I started modeling and my already there ED got 100x worse. I was essentially being marketed as \u201cBrandy Melville girl with edge\u201d. I fit into their pants with ease, their shirts were perfect for me and I loved the brand. \n\nThe one size fits all never bothered me, although I did think it was poor wording. Their clothes could fit some different sizes of my friends, but obviously they were marketing to tall thin girls. \n\nAnyways, as I started getting more into modeling, this look was ingrained in me. A 25 inch waist turned into 24 which turned into 23. I looked like a pencil. I had no boobs or butt. I was at my lowest weight, and I was getting the most attention from NY/LA agencies and photographers who loved my edgy, yet \u201cinnocent\u201d look. \n\nI quit modeling At 16.5. I continued to wear their clothes as I gained weight but really was straying away from the brand. \n\nYesterday, I was in CA so I decided to go in and do some shopping for myself. I stepped in and was low key horrified. I am still 5\u20199.5 and 125 pounds, so still very thin and barely at a healthy weight (but feeling great!). \n\nAll the clothes looked SMALLER than they had been two years ago. I was questioning if I would even fit in the clothes with my newfound boobs and butt. Most workers in there looked to be about 14 (which I confirmed after I asked one of them how old they were) and the average waist size of the bottoms were about 23 inches. TWENTY THREE. \n\nI was bumbling around in shock, when I decided to look at their social media and saw all the girls that reminded me of me when I was their age. I\u2019m not saying all of them are unhealthy, or have an ED, but it just made me feel a little sad at that possibility. \n\nI bought some things and left. And now decided I\u2019m just done with the brand. And I\u2019m done with that part of my life. I don\u2019t judge ANYONE for wearing them (heck, I probably will for a little longer until i phase them out of my closet), but I don\u2019t think I can personally support a brand that caused a lot of hell for me and I was associated with for a long time. \n\nBye bye Brandy Melville, I wish you the best but I also wish you could make your clothing fit most of the young teen population.

I am doing weight watchers so I do track my food to know what foods and how much of each food makes my body feel so I can talk myself down from the BED ledge when those behaviors pop up. \n\nI am doing all of these things to recover from this eating disorder but after a week of not taking the medication, I feel like I\u2019m going to be competent dependent on it for the rest of my life.

I've been paroozing the meme subreddit which has been very refreshing. Even though I consider myself an open book, my eating habits are something I share with nobody. The way I view myself is just sad. I know I've always thought myself to be bigger than I am, after looking at old photographs and thinking to myself \"you seriously thought that was overweight?\" I find myself constantly looking in mirrors and reflections of windows to check if I've gained or lost a few since the last time I checked. I have a corrupt sense of satisfaction when I'm the smallest in the room, as if it's some prize to won. I wish I didn't think like this, but the thoughts are still there. Always there. \n\nEver since I was young I've had a binging problem. So much so, my mom had put a lock on the sugary foods cabinet because I would just keep coming back for more. My mom, although I love her, may be a partial cause to my obsessions with food. She was always restricting me from typical childhood treats, which resulted in me having such strong cravings for them I would binge them any chance I could take. \n\nI remember always thinking I was overweight, and constantly dissatisfied with looking down at my legs. Throughout junior high, almost everyday when I got home, I would binge on sugar. I would eat a bowl of icecream, oreos, and cookies while watching tv. Then I would still eat dinner afterwards, regardless of not being hungry. I don't know how but I managed to keep a pretty small frame throughout that, (god bless the metabolism of a growing kid). I would eat myself to the point that it was painful, then wallow in self pity and disgust as I ponder the thought of throwing it all up. However, I've honestly never been brave enough to do so. But the thought has entered my mind every single time.\n\nAround my sophomore year my metabolism slowed, the weight finally caught up to me, and I completely gave up on my appearance. Wore all black, and wore over sized everything. My self esteem was practically non-existent. I did not wear makeup, and I wore my hair in a low-pony like a middle aged man working at a vape shop. Not my cutest moment. \n\nAfter about a year of looking the worst and feeling the worst I'd ever been, I finally realized my weight and diet was what was making me so unhappy. I watched a vegan documentary that made me realize major flaws in my diet. After that I went vegetarian the summer before my senior year. I counted calories and ate healthy, and developed a decent exercise routine. I managed to lose a significant amount of weight over the summer, and felt the best I'd ever felt after cutting out meat and many processed foods I used to binge on.\n\nIn the process of losing all the weight, I hardly had any binge episodes. I felt amazing. I finally understood nutrition and how to take care of my body. However once the weight stopped coming off, I think I had started to become obsessed with the idea of losing weight. Even though I had reached my goal, it was never *really* enough. Then came the \"fasts\". Let's see how long I can go without eating, maybe skip some feeding days here and there. That will surely fix my plateau, so I thought. Boy was I wrong. Skipping eating only made me obsess over the thought of food, resulting in me binging on anything I could get my hands on in the middle of the night. Eating to the point of pain. My binging habits were back. I'd lost control again. I've been in this never ending cycle of binging and starving ever since. For example, I didn't eat anything for three days  this week, yet tonight I ate a whole day's worth of food and then binged on 1000 calories worth of raisins??? What the hell is wrong with me??\n\nEarlier this year I became vegan, which I am rather passionate about and proud of myself for finally making the transition. However, I can't help but feel that part of the reason I'm doing it is for my weight rather than my health, the animals and the environment.\n\nI'm constantly browsing media about nutrition and diets. My recent obsession has been with intermittent fasting and posts of that nature. I'm just exhausted at this point. I just want to eat like a normal person. My stomach can't take this constant stretching and shrinking. \n\nI've never had boyfriend until last year, which happened to be right around when I was at my skinniest, having just lost all my excess weight. It is kinda a long distance relationship, we only get to see eachother once a week. I have this fear that he will leave me if I pack on any weight, so I don't eat anything the day before I see him or the day of (unless I have to eat around him, then I will just to not raise any red flags of course.) If I have a particularly bad binge week, I honestly don't look forward to him seeing me. I'm tired of putting all my self worth based on my weight.\n\nI hate everything I've written about me on this post. I'm disgusted and disappointed in what I've turned into. I hate how much time I've spent thinking about my goddamn waistline. I wish nothing I've written here is true. It is the ugly truth unfortunately. It's so hard for me to open up about this, I feel like it's just too taboo to discuss with people that don't go through this. Sorry for rambling on about my entire life's relationship with food. I'm sick of the binging, I'm sick of the starving. I don't know how I'm going to get through this, but I'm going to do it. No matter what it takes, I just can't continue living like this.

I have been in and out of recovery for anorexia with bulimic cognitions since I was 10 years old, and over the years have amassed many tasty recipes at all the stages of my eating disorder; to help encourage recovery, I would break the menu into 3 sections: 1) lowest possible cal, 2) medium cal, 3) \"normal\" cals for that dish.\n\nThe \"cat\" specific part is because I love cats, but also to hopefully give people a calming/\"therapeutic\" space, and possibly give people \"a reason\" to go to a place that serves ED friendly food.\n\nOne response I got said that it would be beneficial to not market the cafe as an \"ED\" cafe, because it may essentially \"out\" someone. Personally, with the intention of the cafe being to help sufferers, I think it would be more impactful if it was marketed as such, but I also don't know if that *actually* is more helpful.\n\nAnother helpful response suggested  engaging the patrons to help them build a sense of community/support, but I have no ideas on how to do that, or what to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm currently just \"testing the waters\", so depending on how the idea is received, I plan on talking to an ED specialist about the concept before continuing forward.

I don't live at home anymore obviously and live in a different city so I don't see my family as much as some. Which made it all the more evident Last time I visited for a week with my toddler and newborn that she has changed.\n\nLet me begin to say she has always been a slight girl. No meat on her bones. Very very thin. I am not that lucky lol.\n\nAnyways. It started with her refusing to eat fast food or takeout. My parents often get pizza or eat out with my other siblings. But my sister would get mad and refuse, start fights if my parents told her to just eat it. If she knew they were going out she'd pack food or make sure to eat before they went so she wouldn't have to eat take out. Ok whatever right.\n\nWell it since has escalated. She barely eats. She will eat one boiled egg every morning, maybe with an apple(let's say around 8am). She will not eat again til she has her lunch around 1 or2 like clockwork. She'll maybe have a can of tuna. Then at dinner she will take a very modest portion of chicken and Veggies.\n\nShe is not eating enough calories for sure. She also never used to be like this. All of her favorites she now refuses to eat. My mom bought protein bars out of concern and asked her to eat Them and she refused. Arguments will arise over her refusal to eat. We went out for lunch her, me my son and our grandmother and she REFUSED to eat while the rest of us were eating. \n\nShe also does not look well she weighs only 70lbs. Her hands are always blue she's constantly freezing. And I noticed she comes home and takes a nap instantly almost maybe to avoid snacking? Not sure. \n\nShe also has a history of ocd behavior and ritual type stuff that hasn't been further investigated but I think she needs help. Her attitude toward food has become bizarre and fanatic. It breaks my heart watching it because no matter what she says she is just not herself. She's put herself on such a restrictive diet and will not stray from it. \n\nOh yeah and she always is eager to prepare food for others despite all this. Like constantly asking me, my parents, my siblings etc if they want her to make them breakfast and so on. Yet she won't eat any of it herself. \n\nWhat do you all think? I told my mom they need to get to the bottom of it but I just worry what is going on in her mind. She is already so petite. \n", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

However, I've seen conflicting information about whether or not to give into the extreme hunger (vs following a slightly elevated caloric plan). I'm unable to go to a clinic at this point in time, but want to start recovery while I have the courage to do so. I have bouts of strong physical hunger where I start literally scavenging like an animal for food (or I start to breathe heavy and get really physically irritated) but that tends to come and go. I never feel full no matter how much I eat, and no matter how much I eat, no matter what I do, my thoughts tend to trail back to \"food\". And it's nothing in particular, I'm not imaging cookies or pizza or cake or whatever, my brain just goes back to very singular thoughts like \"food\" \"hungry\" \"Im hungry\" even when I don't physically feel so. I could gorge myself until I get what feels like a rock in my stomach and my brain will continue its mantra of \"food-food-food-food\". It's really weird, to be honest. However, I'm afraid I could actually bust my stomach open with that so I'm not sure whether I should give in to it or not.\n\nWhat form of recovery worked best for you (food wise)? What should I be looking out for? Anyone else have the \"almost all my thoughts are about food or eating\" even when they're eating? What am I aiming for? What brought back your period? Any other tips?\n\nBTW: I never became underweight, but did lose a lot of weight in a short span (6-7 months).", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

Plus, it's hard to eat when you don't want to taste nail polish!\n* Jigsaw puzzles. I think it occupies my mind enough that the binging urge can't fully settle into my brain.\n* Video games. I know this probably triggers some people's binges, but for me, my hands and mind are occupied.\n* Socializing. I don't really have anyone to do that with most of the time... but when I do, it helps. I get distracted and I can't go and buy loads of food if a friend is with me. Obviously this doesn't really work if it's, say, a party with tons of snacks, but if it's one-on-one AND I have to talk so my mouth is occupied? It helps a lot.\n* Sleeping. Not always the most practical, but if I manage to fall asleep, the binging urge is usually gone by the time I wake up.  \n\n\nThe biggest two issues for me are if I'm watching videos and a food ad comes on. Seriously, there needs to be a way to block **all** food ads. They don't even work the way the companies want! I want whatever food is shown, but not necessarily the brand. You show me a McDonald's ad, and I'm more likely to go to Wendy's because it's closer and I need it \\[i\\]now\\[/i\\]. The other thing is my jaw. IDK if anyone else experiences this, but before my worst binging urges (especially sugar-based ones), my jaw tenses up? It's almost painful, it's right at where the top and bottom jaw meet, and it won't go away until I give in. Does anyone else get that, and if so, how do you get past it? What are some of your tips to wait out an urge?  \n", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I'm trying to find the SAFEST way to get enough electrolytes. \n\nFrom what I read I should be trying to get: sodium chloride (salt), magnesium, potassium. \n\nThe first thing I found was snake juice. Snake juice seems CRAZY and potentially unsafe. It's just so much salt (and potassium, which I read can be dangerous in high quantities)...and I read on this sub that baking soda can also be harsh on the stomach. So (unless you have better info) I think I want to avoid snake juice because I don't to hurt myself. \n\nThe second option I found was sports drinks / electrolyte supplements such as Mio, but they didn't seem to have enough electrolytes? I don't know much about this, I'd appreciate information. \n\nThe third option I found was pills. There are magnesium citrate pills which give all the magnesium you need in a day (is this safe or is it dangerous to have too much magnesium?). As for potassium, it can be dangerous so there aren't pills that give more than 99mg (2% DV).\n\nRight now, I am inclined to do the following: drink lots of both (for salt) and have 1 magnesium citrate pill per day (for magnesium). This seems safest and will get me 2/3 electrolytes. Am I missing a safe option? In particular do I need potassium and if yes how do I get it? \n\nSorry for the long post, there's just a lot of conflicting information out there about electrolytes.

raw broccoli ??? i did this with lots of different vegetables depending on what they had that day but i'm a hoe for cruciferous veg so that's mostly what i got \n\n- taken like 8 apples at a time to do apple monos \n\n- they have a section for cereal/milk and they offer unsweetened almond milk so i've definitely used a swipe just to fill up a few bottles to take back with me \n\nthese are all pretty insane but that's not even the worst part. i am an absolute GOBLIN in my binge phases, and unlimited food plus AN b/p does NOT mix. for more context, i am visibly underweight so i get looks already (my bmi ranges from 14-15 depending on what phase i'm in) and i will remind you again that this dining hall is VERY PUBLIC. when i'm in binge mode i have z e r o shame apparently. \n\n- a standard binge usually involves me making a beeline for the bakery to see what they have. i'm a monster who can't get enough sugar and their cookies are bomb as fuck, so i'll usually load up with like 6 and then get some brownies or cupcakes or whatever they have that day. after i get my haul, i get a big ass bowl of cereal and dip all of my cakes/cookies/etc. into it to soak them in milk and eat them like that. then i eat the cereal. it's fuckin' weird enough for someone to literally only eat desserts but i have to do it that way for e f f i c i e n c y   \n\n- at the sandwich station they have peanut butter, jelly, butter/cream cheese for bagels, etc. but one time they had nutella so of course i got a bunch of chocolate chip cookies, spread nutella on them and made nutella chocolate chip cookies sandwiches then i dipped them in a glass of chocolate soy milk and ate them. it was like two hours before they closed so i was pretty alone but there was a middle aged man watching me the whole time and he looked like a mix of disgusted and terrified but i'm an absolute demon and pressed on anyway  \n\n- taken the cereal bowls to the soft serve machine instead of using the cones or small bowls and filled that bitch up. i also dip brownies and cookies into the ice cream, or crumble them up into it \n\n- i have eaten MULTIPLE peanut butter and chocolate sauce sandwiches just cause i had the ability to make them. no one girl should have all that power \n\n- i accidentally went to the dining hall when my roommate was there, unbeknownst to me, and made direct eye contact with her while carrying two plates, one with 3 slices of pizza drenched in ranch with a giant pile of fries, the other with probably 4 cookies, 2 cupcakes, and a bigass waffle. she didn't acknowledge me, i didn't acknowledge her, we didn't talk about it later   \n\n+plus probably a whole lot more that i can't remember. i don't know exactly why i felt the need to confess my sins here but i guess i just want anyone who reads this long ass post to know that hey, if you're ever feeling embarrassed by the way your ED makes you act, you're probably not nearly as embarrassing as i am! my eating disorder has turned me into an absolutely insane vomit gremlin with zero sense of shame.

I was morbidly obese, but never hit underweight, and was eventually diagnosed with OSFED (atypical anorexia). I was pretty physically sick despite not being underweight. I went into treatment and gained about 35lbs again putting me in the overweight range. Doctors are okay with this, and I would be tbh except I look atrocious :(\n\nThe majority of the weight is in my stomach, and my face is chubby too. I have some in my upper thighs. But my legs general and ESPECIALLY my shoulders, upper back, arms look skinny and spindly.\n\nI have spoken to my therapist about this and he says it's just in my head, but he hasn't actually seen my body (obviously). I also hide the weight around my tummy well with baggy clothes, my therapist weighs me and seems to think I have extra muscle because I don't look 'that fat' in the bits he can see I assume, he says thats why my weight is higher than normal BMI. I certainly don't have extra muscle, I'm weak as a kitten. It's just I look skinnier when I hide my tummy, and my arms and legs are the only things people can really see.\n\nIt's definitely not in my mind either\n\n* My leggings that fit snugly around my stomach are actually baggy on my legs, my therapist mistook my denim coloured leggings for actual jeans because of the baggyness around the legs. It's just cus I need a bigger size for my stomach, but that makes them baggy around my mid and lower legs. \n\n* I have gone up **four** sizes in pants/leggings around my waist, but I am still wearing the same bralette and tight sports bras I was 35lbs ago! Seriously. My breasts have grown a little but they still don't need much support, and my upper body is still boney, small and pokey. \n\n* I am apparently 'overweight' now, with a very obvious fat face and double chin, yet you can still see my upper ribs clearly (cant wear low cut tops because with my fat face is just looks bizarre), my clavicle is still apparent, and my shoulders pokey/boney! And tops fit similarly, baggy around my top half but many are straining around my stomach. I have to get a bigger size to fit around my mid-section that makes my top half look super drowned.\n\nSo yeah, this is definitely not in my head. It's making it hard to find clothes that even fit properly let alone are at all flattering! I have read online it's normal but I've been in recovery for just under 2 years now. I have hit a stable weight for 8 months! And I still look like this? \n\nWhen will this change? Will it change? It's really extreme.

It\u2019s all a matter of time until someone noticed my ED.", "author": "Swanabe", "self_text": "Notices* fucking typo. \n\n\nSo, I\u2019ve talked a little about my ED history here before but just some quick background: When I was a teenager I developed a restrictive ED, and was ultimately put into a terribly fat-logicy \u201crecovery\u201d program which directly caused me to develop BED and put on over 100lbs past a healthy weight. \n\n\nAfter some scary health issues caused by an unrelated chronic illness surfaced, binging was no longer possible for me to do on a regular basis. My restrictive ED tendencies kicked back in. Of course, since I was hugely obese when I started my weight loss, no one has been concerned that I\u2019ve lost weight so quickly, I\u2019m just a success story. My ED is partially restrictive (I high restrict at 850-1000 cal a day) part orthorexia (honestly, this is almost unavoidable for me since I have so many food restrictions caused by my other chronic illnesses), and calorie purging via lots of working out. So, my health is actually kinda great. My physical health has improved like 200 fold since I started to relapse into my restricting, and my mental health has actually improved in many way as well, in that I\u2019m a more productive, effective, confident, and mentally balanced person now than I was when I was binging. On the outside everyone thinks I went from a sick fatty to a health conscious fitness nut. Even my doctors are impressed, and not the least bit concerned. \n\nI\u2019m getting away with drastically under eating, doing OMAD, and working out excessively right under the noses of all my loved ones, who would most certainly object if they knew what I was really up to, because I started off as fat. \n\nToday something dawned on me though. I looked in the mirror and saw my collar bones, my cheek bones, my newly tiny wrists, and my slender arms. I still see my body as being way too big (it is! I\u2019m still technically overweight) but today was the first time I noticed that I\u2019m not inarguably fat anymore. In terms of American women, I\u2019m normal, a little smaller than normal even. 6.4lbs down from now I\u2019ll have a healthy BMI. In just a couple months I\u2019ll be at the low end of a healthy BMI when I reach first my goal weight. I\u2019m so close. \n\nAt first I was giddy to realize I\u2019m not the hugely fat girl anymore, and that I\u2019m so close I can almost feel what it\u2019s like to be thin again. Then I realized that being that fat girl was a bit of a security blanket against skepticism, and concern over my weight loss. How long will it be now until a family member gets worried about how fast I\u2019m losing? How long before my best friend takes me aside and asks if I\u2019m eating often enough? How long before loved ones start talking behind my back about how worried they are? How long before I no longer feel comfortable cheerfully announcing saying \u201cI lost 12,13,14, or 15lbs this month!\u201d because I know that instead of congratulations, that declaration will be met with concern? How much longer will my eating habits go unquestioned? How much longer will my workouts be praised rather than discouraged? How much time do I have before I\u2019m not able to do as I please without having to defend my choices? How long do I have before people start trying to interfere?\n\nIt won\u2019t be today I\u2019m still chubby. It won\u2019t be tomorrow or even next week. But next month? Maybe. Two months? That\u2019s even more likely. I can say for sure that I won\u2019t make it 4 more months of this without some type of intervention from concerned family members. What the fuck do I do then? I refuse to go back to inpatient, that was the worst thing that ever happened to me. I refuse to \u201ceat normally\u201d when I\u2019ve finally found a way of living that makes me happy.

I started a diet at the beginning of the year, which ended up turning into some distress and disordered eating habits, and I've seen a few doctors and have since been informed that I do have some sort of eating disorder.  Basically, I'm mostly restricting and eating less than 1000 calories a day, with some days as low as 500 with my average amount probably being 750 a day.  I'm a 22 year old 5 feet 11 inches male, so I'm eating like 33% of what I'm supposed to be eating each day (except that I'm making sure I get plenty of protein).  I'm working out about 4 or 5 times a week and I'm only eating very healthy foods.  I'm in college, and it has been much easier to restrict when I'm not at my apartment because I'm not around food all of the time and tempted by it.  But now I am on spring break and one of the days after I got home I told myself that I would try and recover from this restriction and eat more food and slightly more unhealthy food for a day, so I got 3 donuts from Dunkin.  I ended up eating these donuts and was hoping I could try and stay under 2000 calories for that day.  The 3 donuts were about 900 total calories, and I knew I would have to have a bit more to eat.  I have this awful thing with my ED where if I have gone over 1000 calories (over half of the recommended daily amount) then I have \"failed\" for that day.  I need to eat less than half of the recommended amount of calories or else that day has been a failure, so since I was over 1000 for that day I for some reason just decided to go all out and I BINGED.  This is the first time I had had more than 1000 calories since my extreme restriction had began about 3 weeks prior.  I had about 2000 calories within a couple of hours, and that entire day I had had 3500 calories.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after I binged all of that, I took some laxatives to try and \"make up for it\", and I went back to restriction immediately the next day.  Luckily my weight hadn't changed much (I was still at around \\~ 157 pounds), which was good, but I still felt like shit despite loving the binge while it was happening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I am getting help for my eating issues, but I haven't had that many therapy/mental health appointments yet, so I'm still not feeling much better in regards to the mental health aspects behind this.  So basically, once I go back to school in about 3 days I know I'm going to be restricting for a while, and I don't have too terribly much food in my apartment, so before I go back I was planning on having 1 more binge at home with the food that is here.  But this time I was planning on probably trying to vomit for the first time after my binge is over.  I KNOW how dumb this is and how horrible purging by vomiting is, but I feel like it's going to be more effective than using laxatives in terms of making sure I gain as little weight as possible.  I feel like there is definitely a large chance that I'm going to make myself vomit after I binge, and I guess I'll just have to wait and see what happens.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, I told my friend who has struggled with an ED about my plan for this (which was incredibly stupid of me and I should have known better), and she got very upset and said how extremely triggering it was, and now I feel horrible.  She told me not to apologize since I didn't know any better, but I STILL feel TERRIBLE and like an asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHaving an ED sucks and I hope some of you guys can see where I'm coming from and please let me know if any of you can relate.  Please help me feel better about upsetting my friend since she said she's not mad at me since I didn't know any better, but I still feel like a pile of shit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading this! &lt;3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl:dr  I've been struggling with an eating disorder lately and I had a binge once I got home for spring break.

Basically ive been dealing with disordered eating since I was 14, I'm 22 now, in college, it kinda comes and goes, but I went to my school's counseling department to try to get some help because it is at this point really taking a toll on my life and my grades. \n\nSo Tuesday was a hard day...\n\nI went to school, couldnt pay attention in statistics, went to abnormal psych right after, and the topic was Eating Disorders.. Kind of a touchy subject for me, but I actually did learn a lot from that lecture and ended up writing a paper about it for extra credit.\n\nAnyway, then I went to the counseling and set up an appointment. It was hard for me to do because i realized, yeah I actually let myself get so bad that I NEED this, and felt like a failure. \n\nWent back later for the appt, and the psychiatrist sat me down, asked me a lot of questions, I told her about how I restrict, how much i restrict, how often I b/p, etc.\n\nSo what I didnt expect was for her to encourage me to make a checkup appointment at the student clinic...\n\nI really dont think I'm even that bad off, im not underweight, and I only b/p like 3 times a week, still have regular bowel movements, periods, etc. But she wanted me to go for a checkup, so she called the clinic while I was sitting there (which she asked my permission to do first which was nice) and she explained to them what was going on. And it was really hard to hear. It was so hard to hear her talk out loud about all the things that I do in secret. \"finding_ferris restricts to xxx calories a day, and self induced vomiting 3 times a week.\" Out loud. She told me she was going to say it, I was okay with that, it was just so hard to hear.\n\nSo then I went to the clinic with my paperwork, and I got rushed in for the checkup that day. They took my weight, first with clothes on, then came back in with a paper robe and asked me to undress and get on the scale again. I'm aware why they do this, but do you really think I would WANT to weigh more than I already do??? No! I'm not hiding rocks in my pocket. I want to weigh LESS, thats why I'm here lol. So I didnt really get that but i guess they had to because they slapped the ED label on ya girl. \n\nThen during the appointment, the nurse practitioner came and sat down with me, asked me a bunch more questions, super hard for me but I answered them honestly, then laid me on the table and squished my guts and throat around, I felt like a dog at the vet. \n\nAt the end she said she wanted me to do some bloodwork and set up an appointment with the lab to get a sample drawn, and set up a checkup with her. So now I have like so many appointments, wtf. I didn't ask for this. And I dont understand it really.\n\nFlash forward to the next day, I go in to get blood drawn and it went ok, I had never had it done before so I was quite anxious. I felt really light headed afterward so they laid me down and gave me ice and saltines. And I'm laying there looking like that lady in the meme with all the mathematical equations trying to calculate the calories in the 2 saltines I was given. \n\nThen when i was checking out the receptionist told me i owed $25 for the lab fee or something, and I almost cried because I feel like I didnt ask for any of this, I just wanted some counseling to help stop it, and now theyre taking my blood and charging me for it, so I said basically, I'm not paying that, and left and took an hour long nap on the ground outside the building. \n\nI'm wondering, since I'm so new to this medical and counseling stuff, is this shit normal???? It honestly seems like they were all over reacting, and trying to scare me. I feel like a lab rat or something. I just feel like theyre pushing me around, and i dont like that feeling. It makes me never want to go back to the counseling service or the clinic, if they're going to do this, I just dont understand why theyre doing this and is this protocol or something? I dont even really feel like my ED is that bad. I'm starting to regret even going in in the first place, if everything was just going to get blown out of proportion like this.\n\n\n", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

{"post_id": "b3t17r", "created_utc": 1553187804, "title": "Skinny Privilege: The Ultimate Goal", "author": "Adrenalize_me", "self_text": "I need to rant about a conversation I had a few weeks ago that's been gnawing at me since it happened. This may be long, apologies in advance.\n\n\u2022Trigger Warning\u2022\n\nSo, I was talking with my husband and SIL about where to eat, and my husband brought up this restaurant that he's loved since they opened. I have never been fond of going there, which is relevant, and I'll get there in a minute.\n\nIt was a Sunday, and where I live (very religious area) many, if not most, businesses are closed on Sundays. So we googled the restaurant to see the hours and found that it has been permanently closed. Husband (who is the literal DEFINITION of male thinspo: 6'1\" and 140 lbs) expressed his disappointment that it had closed and couldn't figure out, for the life of him, why this restaurant could have closed.\n\nHere's why I didn't like this place:\n\nThe place was a protein-themed restaurant which touted clean eating and had high-protein, low-carb everything. It attracted every thin and beautiful person in the area. All the rich, blond, trophy wives with tiny, gorgeous waists and fake boobs and lips; and the roided-out dudes who can't put their arms straight down at their sides or turn their heads because of the sheer amount of muscle on them.\n\nAs a person who has bounced back and forth from anorexia nervosa to binge eating disorder, (never could manage to purge, though not for lack of trying) I have had more than my fair share of weight fluctuation. Right now, I'm closer to my highest weight ever, so if I ever gathered up the cojones to actually go in there, I stuck out like a fat sore thumb. I was ALWAYS the highest BMI in the building, and it was humiliating.\n\nSo Husband asks why I never liked eating at this place, and I explained that it was a skinny-people-only restaurant, and I didn't like the looks I got walking in there, or the way the staff treated me obviously different than they treated my husband. He disagreed and said that he never saw me treated badly.\n\nI told him \"That's because you have skinny privilege.\"\n\nHe scoffed and said \"There's no such th-\"\n\nAnd his sister cut him off and said \"Don't you dare say there's no such thing as skinny privilege.\"\n\nMy SIL has been overweight her entire life, and does not have any eating disorders that I know of (except maybe BED, but if she does, it's undiagnosed.) So she gets it.\n\nNow I have been on both extreme ends of the weight spectrum. I've been both underweight and obese, and there is a TANGIBLE difference in how I'm treated when I'm skinny from how I'm treated when I'm obese. My husband has only ever seen skinny treatment, and no one would ever notice how the treatment of *someone else* changes over time; they'd have to be watching that other person's interactions like a psycho. So, I don't blame him for not noticing, because how could he have?\n\nThat skinny privilege is so seductive to me, though, because I've experienced it in direct contrast to how people seem to distance themselves from you when you're fat. They keep you at arms length, no longer seeking out your presence like they did when you were beautiful. Our society does this infuriating thing where it shouts \"EATING DISORDERS ARE BAD, JUST EAT HEALTHY!\" while simultaneously bombarding you with dainty, fairy-like bodies and a just-as-loud message of \"IF *THESE PEOPLE* CAN DO IT, THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR YOU! FATNESS IS AN EPIDEMIC!\" that just drives people down the ED rabbit hole.\n\nThe people who are *at* the skinny weight of my dreams (and I've even seen it confessed in the support subs on reddit, maybe even this one, but I can't remember specifically) say publicly that they got there by good ol' diet and exercise, while hiding the fact that they actually had to adopt severely disordered eating patterns to get that way (excluding the people who \"naturally\" stay slim, like my dear husband, who insist they eat tons when really they just have the hunger drive of a rock.)\n\nOur society is like the Wizard of Oz, putting out this beautiful charade of \"You, too, can look like a supermodel, if only you eat your greens and exercise,\" while the little balding man behind the curtain works to conceal the little truth that's too ugly to be socially acceptable.\n\nIt's really sad, to me, when women who are at \"healthy\" BMIs are told by their SOs that they've become chubby, and that they could stand to lose a few kgs. When I was recovering, and had finally gotten back into the middle of the healthy BMI range (the goal set for me by my doctor) I was repeatedly told I looked healthier when I was solidly underweight, and that I shouldn't let myself get too out of control, or I'd gain all the weight back and then some. These people were all well-meaning, and none of them knew I had an eating disorder. No one knew I'd been underweight, because we're constantly surrounded by gorgeous underweight people who insist that they're healthy and that they're not underweight, and we believe them. Why would someone *that* beautiful lie? So, when we see someone at a healthy weight, they look chubby, because who wouldn't look chubby standing next to the beautiful dream?\n\nThose comments murdered my self esteem, because why did \"healthy\" have to be synonymous with \"ugly\"? Why did I have to endure these \"concerned\" family members warning me to keep the control before I lost it and became \"as big as a house\"? No one commented on my body when I was underweight, except to tell me they wish they had it, that they envied me.\n\nWell, your prophecy came true, nosy family members... I'm officially as big as a house, and I've never hated my body more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\* If you read this whole thing, thank you so much. I'm struggling lately. Here's to the pursuit of that skinny privilege. Cheers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

And really feel like dying.\nI kept waking up in and out of sleep and I just kept thinking \u201cI want to die\u201d and \u201cplease kill me\u201d and \u201cI want to go back to sleep\u201d and now it\u2019s so much worse. this morning I tried really hard to stay calm and tried to tell myself that it was okay, but now I can\u2019t even imagine that.\n\n I know I brought this on myself and I\u2019m a dumbass, but I feel fucking TERRIBLE. I don\u2019t even feel like exercising can help me right now. My binges NEVER get this bad, I usually stay around 1200-1500 but they\u2019ve been getting so much worse now. I know logically I should try and restrict higher to keep these binges down but if it\u2019s anything over 500, I immediately feel like a failure and binge.\n\nPart of me is sick of everything. I\u2019m not losing weight anymore, I\u2019m wasting my fucking time in general by having safe foods and all my food rituals and obsessing over calories. Since my relapse in May I have done NOTHING but hurt myself. Whether it be starving myself or eating more than what my body requires, I literally have not had a normal day of eating in almost a year.\n\nI know I should get help but I just don\u2019t think I can bring myself to, because it would change everything. I have a \u201clist\u201d of things I need to check off before i feel like I can even consider recovering, things like:\n\u2022 get to be underweight\n\u2022 faint once\n\u2022 go to the hospital at least once\n\u2022 see my rib cage\n\u2022 feel \u201csick enough\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s SO fucked up because I know that even if I get all of those things it won\u2019t aid me in considering recovery. If anything it will make me resent it more since I\u2019ll think that I had worked so hard to lose weight and I don\u2019t want to ruin my \u2018progress\u2019... \n\nEven now, though, I\u2019m not sure I want to recover. It\u2019s like I DO but I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not even sure there\u2019s anything wrong with me honestly, I\u2019m not diagnosed with anything. Even if I tried to get help I would probably be turned down since I don\u2019t look sick.\n\nBut, I relapsed when I was 14, and I ended up losing most of that year to my ED.

The last three years of high school were spent hating everything about myself, destroying relationships with people who cared about me, and trying not to end my life.

I'm not at all harming my body' \n\nI look at myself and can't really connect to the fact that I am actually an adult that is responsible for my own life now. I'm standing here dissociating, weighing less than I did when I started high school, and I can't shake the feeling that I never grew out of adolescence. None of this makes sense to me. Everything has passed in a blur. Where did the last 7 years go, and how can I get them back? Where is the life I dreamed of that didn't involve obsessing over every mistake I've ever made, every moment I've convinced myself that I was a failure. \n\n I keep thinking one day I'll wake up in my childhood bedroom feeling content with who I am as a human being. I so miss that innocence that allowed me to look to the future with awe and inspiration. This ED has left me feeling so powerless and I'm spiraling out control.

The last 2 years of college &amp; grad school has been me gaining a little bit of weight here &amp; there... 15-20lbs a year... and that added up to where I was 188 at one point. I never saw 190 on the scale and was scared to. \n\nI tried to \u201cdiet\u201d again on Dec 25 of 2018.

I was motivated at first to lose the weight, just chugging on tea instead of snacks, resisting temptations and all. But the binge cycle would come back and I would sneak food\u2014eat alone, eat fast so no one can see, etc. \n\nI got so used to going to bed with a stuffed stomach that I became unable to sleep without binging. It was toxic. I would eat for anything\u2014if I was happy, I celebrated. If I was sad, I ate to feel better. If I was mad I ate. Any emotions, I ate. After dates, I would eat because I felt rejected and food was the only thing that made me feel better. I have depression and anxiety too that I\u2019m on medications/ therapy for, which doesn\u2019t help this situation. \n\nFood was good and always there for me.

I realized I fit the criteria and realized I was out of control. She talked about how even with an eating disorder she lost weight, and that it is possible. \n\nSo I am turning to Instagram and online for support. And to admit this.

Anyway, fast forward a bit, add high school food freedom plus an incident in college and BAM....hello the beginning of my BED.\n\nNow on to present day. I am an emotional binge-eater...doesn\u2019t matter the emotion. My main trigger is negative emotions (stress, frustration, sadness, anger...you get the picture).\n\nWell I have been really proud of myself lately in that I haven\u2019t binged in 11 days (usually can\u2019t go more then 3 days) and have actually lost around 15 lbs since January 3rd 2019. Not bad for someone who isn\u2019t incredibly overweight if I do say so myself.\n\nWell, I guess I\u2019m wrong because my SO has been stewing in silence for two weeks and we finally talked tonight. Basically he told me that he would rather sit in silence then bring up the fact that he isn\u2019t attracted to me nor in love with me (we have had this conversation before) because I am \u201coverweight\u201d and apparently \u201cdon\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing\u201d in the gym nor kitchen (even though I do and even if I didn\u2019t he said he wasn\u2019t going to help me). He told me (the first time we had this conversation) that I needed to lose 30 pounds (he isn\u2019t far off....I think 20-25 is more realistic and livable) and I\u2019m just not losing it fast enough. *ouch*\n\nI will be honest, I\u2019ve had some major slip ups in the last year were my weight has gone up and down the same 7 lbs but to tell me I\u2019ve made little to no progress?!?!! I\u2019m so heart broken and all I want to do is binge but I know that won\u2019t solve anything. *heart shatters into a million pieces*\n\nAnyway, thank you for reading if you got this far.

Obviously weight started to shred, food was becoming less- I didn\u2019t realise what I was doing or even trying for that fact. \n\nFriends said I was being weird with food, I just shrugged it off because I honestly didn\u2019t realise.

At least 8 times a day. It was painful and I felt helpless. \n\nI ended up in hospital, despite not being underweight. Bulimia actually made me gain like 14 kgs. Lots of water and food weight. Being in the hospital was actually really good as it made me eat what they had and took away the control. I was discharged and my family said no more help as I should be better now.

I used to be an athlete, and when I got injured gained some weight in sophomore/junior year of high school. I lost a lot of weight senior year literally without trying just because of my schedule, not working out whatsoever but eating really healthy, the same things every day, at the same times (in retrospect, I realize a big part of this was probably eating breakfast at 7am, and dinner at 530 or so, and never eating at night moreso than what I was eating). My freshman year of college, I was so poor that I would go several days without food, and so stressed that I didn\u2019t have the compulsion to eat: I got down to an underweight BMI, also without exercise. It was the first time in my life I had ever felt \u201cskinny\u201d. I gained some weight back when I started making more money, and dealt with my depression.\n\nI work out pretty regularly (sometimes can\u2019t due to my work schedule/school schedule), and eat generally healthy. I\u2019m writing because I think about food literally all the time. What I\u2019ve eaten, when I should eat, how long I should fast, how much cardio I should do. It consumes every waking thought. I get into cycles where I binge, hard. This has been worsened with intermittent fasting, I think. I\u2019ll fast for 24-48 hours, and at the end sit for several hours in my kitchen, doing nothing but eating until I\u2019m physically uncomfortable and my stomach aches. I\u2019ve also struggled with purging intermittently, last cycle being in the summer. I was working full time, and my work environment is very busy and it was easy for me to slip away to vomit. I would vomit even if I had just had the egg white from a hard boiled egg and a little bit of sliced turkey- I couldn\u2019t make myself keep anything down.\n\nI haven\u2019t told anyone about this. The most \u201ctriggering\u201d thing is when my boyfriend comments on how he can tell I haven\u2019t been working out or touches my stomach or hips. I worry that he\u2019s feeling to see whether I\u2019ve gained weight, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s me projecting or not.\n\nI feel so proud when I am able to fast. I feel so, so guilty when I eat anything. I had a  protein shake and a big kale salad, but then kept eating more and more salad until I felt sick. But that\u2019s the issue: I don\u2019t binge on cake or pizza or candy. I eat really healthy, and binge on healthy stuff, but can\u2019t stop myself from eating, and can\u2019t stop feeling guilty when I do.\n\nI also literally can\u2019t tell what I look like. I don\u2019t know if other people think I\u2019m overweight or skinny. I work out, so sometimes I can see muscle tone (especially when I\u2019ve been working out a lot, which now that I\u2019m writing seems ridiculous in how logical that is), but other times I can\u2019t tell. To me, I look like I have a gut. I constantly feel the fat on my stomach and hips (though I can feel my hip bones easily when I lie down, and can clearly see my ribs when I twist in the mirror. My roommates tell me all the time that I\u2019m too skinny (but they are all obese, so I don\u2019t know).\n\nI get very obsessive about learning about nutrition, trial studies of fasting, benefits of keto, different diets- one of my roommates commented every time she talks to me it seems like I\u2019m cutting something new out of my diet (dairy, meat, sugar, carbs) but it\u2019s transient and I always am getting attached to a new eating style and beating myself up when I don\u2019t stick to it. I\u2019m amazed when I see thin people eating. when I imagine eating as much as they do in a day, I can\u2019t comprehend how they\u2019re able to stay at their size.\n\nI don\u2019t track calories or macros. I\u2019m not actively purging. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m unhealthy. I just don\u2019t want this to constantly be a thing I\u2019m thinking about. When I start getting close to a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d, as in \u201coh, maybe I can eat healthy and when I\u2019m hungry and fuel my body\u201d it\u2019s shut down by \u201cmaybe you\u2019ll gain weight\u201d.

I've been struggling with binge eating since a few months after suffering from anorexia and I know the longer I will let this go on the harder it will be to get rid of. Basically I'm eating right for 3 days, tracking my meals and all and the night of the 4th one I just end up bingeing on cookies or whatever after dinner. Living in Japan with convenience stores literally steps away doesn't help either. To try and make up for that I have been constantly increasing my workouts to the point that I get up a 5am everyday to run a 5k. \nI have a very positive mindset but it makes me depressed to have so many setbacks when I do my best to succeed. I really want to get better. \nIf you have any advice or words of encouragement it would be very much appreciated.

I haven't been a gambler, but goodness do I spend tons of money without even thinking about it and binge multiple times a day, every day. This was a huge red flag to me, seeing how this one med might be a catalyst for some of my binging (I know a part of it is emotional/psychological) and spending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWent to my doc, talked about it. She didn't want to believe I wasn't a heavy binger prior to Abilify. After some talking, she agreed to give it a try. We slowly tapered me off of it as a trial.

I'm also cutting back a lot of my spending (not for the lack of trying before going off Abilify).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis has been a game changer for me and I finally feel some power over myself.

I'm sharing today for a bit of catharsis but also I would like advice, or maybe a friend who is going through something similar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first issue is mindlessness. I often put no thought into what I eat until it is already in my mouth or after I have already purchased it. For example, if there are any treats or breads left on the counter when I go to make a meal for myself I eat them without even pausing to think. I don't eat them as a meal, I eat them while I am making my meal barely even noticing that I have done so until its too late. Or, another common situation for me is hitting the drive through on the way home from a late class. I can end up in a drive through quite mindlessly, or even when I end up there on purpose I often order without thinking and end up with the worst thing on the menu before I remember that I am supposed to be making better choices.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, when I do try to control this mindlessness and put more thought into what I eat, or how often I eat I then turn to anxiety. When I try and plan a meal, think about putting off a meal, or say no to something that is offered to me I am often overcome with an anxious reaction to it. I start panicking, feeling lightheaded and extremely hungry even if I had just ate a few minutes ago. This often happens when I wake up deciding to eat healthier and eat a 'good' breakfast. It's just the thought and pressure of eating healthy weighs on the back of my mind and soon I am feeling sick, heart is pounding and I'm hungry. I often eat just to comfort myself in these situations. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for this rambling post, thank you for letting me share. I don't really know what the options are. It feels like I am often just flipping back and forth between these two states again and again. I've thought about appetite suppressants, because maybe they would help with the anxiety side?

I was probably skinny fat, but definitely a normal weight for most of my life.

My body was not digesting anything, everything was going right through me, and I lost about 25 pounds in about 6 months, and became borderline underweight.  throughout the next 4-5 years, I developed a big fear of a lot of foods while trying to figure out what was making me so sick.

(A job, a house, a normal life with less stress all helped my cause a lot!)  But in the last 3 years or so, I've struggled with binge eating.  I'm wondering though if it is actually reactive eating.  I was never diagnosed with an ED (though I admit I definitely had ortho for a while), but physiologically, I think my body is still reacting the same way to being underweight for so long.\n\nSo now I'm at a normal weight, but I HATE IT.

I don't get them because I am constantly numbing myself with food/internet/music/etc. My life is too monotone and the quickest source of a dopamine boost, or change in emotion, is junk food.\n* I usually binge whenever I feel bored or frustrated, which makes me numb. but if I choose not to binge, the frustration (or frustration of boredom) turns into a different emotion, which is what I want. If I choose not to binge, frustration turns into emotional change quite quickly actually. But if emotional change is so close, why do I always eat and self-sabotage myself? Because I am addicted to feeling numb; I am used to it.\n* So now I have to re-wire my brain from \"*I feel frustrated/bored therefore I should comfort myself with the quickest source of emotional change: food*\" to \"*I feel frustrated/bored therefore I should push through the feeling, and see what I will feel afterwards if I don't numb myself with food/internet/etc.*\" So basically, frustration = a signal to push through. It's a sign that I am getting an emotional change soon.\n* tldr: I binge because I want to change my current negative emotion to some other emotion. The fastest way of doing this is through food (physical chemical change in brain's dopamine). But this also makes me numb, and makes me gain weight.

A friend I haven\u2019t seen in a long time (Like six to eight years) was going to come but ended up ghosting me all day even though I made absolutely sure we had a solid plan. It definitely was more harrowing alone. We made another plan for tomorrow but I don\u2019t have much faith in that, and it\u2019s hard enough to go out as is. Plus I had to wear short shorts in a VERY public place while getting tattooed and I ended up having a lot of pictures taken of me as well as footage for Ink Masters, all without my consent, so I can\u2019t wait to see how that fucks with my BDD! I was really scared and anxious but I actually managed to eat a little bit. I actually LOVE the tattoo I got so I\u2019m glad I decided to go instead of torturing myself. I also got to pick up some really cool oddities that I\u2019m really excited about , but you\u2019ll have to ask for those pics since this is not the appropriate place to share them. I am exhausted and hope I can sleep tonight, and I really hope that my plans don\u2019t fall through two days in a row. I\u2019d like to have some kind of semblance of a social life but I\u2019m pretty close to giving it up as a lost cause.

I have been binging every chance I get since I was about 13. I moved in with my mom and 3 siblings  when I was 12 and learned she kept the kitchen locked at all times. There was even a bike lock on the fridge in case we found a way in there. She is heavy into drugs so she would leave for hours to days at a time and only leave us cans of corn, or a loaf of bread, or her leftovers from the night before, or a pot of rice, etc. Remember, this is all for 4 kids. Sometimes, when she was feeling generous she would order us pizza hut to be delivered to the house while she was gone. Even if we weren't hungry when it came, we had to eat every slice right then for fear of someone else getting to it. When I got a job at a pizza place, I ate thousands of dollars in pizza over the months I worked there. I couldn't pay my cell phone bill or pay for gas money because every dollar went into buying junk food and pizza.\n\nI've never been able to have food around me for more than a day or two. For example, if I get a 1.25 gallon bucket of ice cream at the store, it is gone within a few days. If there is whipped cream in the house, it is gone in hours. If there is chocolate in the house, it's only here bc I forgot to eat it immediately after buying it.\n\nI try to count calories, but for some reason that triggers a HUGE binge just hours later. I try to track my exercise, but that just triggers a binge. I can't sleep between the hours of 12am and 7am, yet staying up late triggers a binge.\n\nI see no way out. I am only lucky that I have a fast metabolism, so I am barely overweight. My stomach is also pretty small so a huge binge for me is eating 2 burgers, a bowl of ice cream, and some pop tarts. That's all my stomach can hold without me throwing up. My only success with stopping binging was for 3 weeks and it was because I had a goal of making the weight I need to join the military, but there was a month long set back so I went right back to binging. My husband cheated on me (with men) a few months ago and I discovered he has a porn addiction. That triggered even heavier binging. \n\nI would honestly give anything to stop. I just can't take this anymore. \n\nEdit: wanted to add more to an already way too long post \u2b07\ufe0f\n\nI also tend to hide food even from my husband. I'll wrap it up in a shirt and hide it near the bed so I can prepare to binge after he goes to sleep. I plan my binges while shopping even. I tell little pointless lies like \"I gave the kid I was babysitting some ice cream, that's why its almost gone!\" Or, \"remember your friend was over? He probably ate that whole 24 pack of sugar cookies.\" Or I'll make an entire pan of brownies and eat it all while hiding in the dark and he will ask what happened to the brownie mix we had and I'll say something like \"remember we only bought one and I already made that batch a few weeks ago?\" It's so unhealthy.

I\u2019ve not purged in nearly seven years but goddamn I am thisclose to starting up again.\n\nI\u2019ve eaten so much here and it is disgusting and I am disgusting and I hate myself. I feel like I\u2019ve gained 10 pounds at least. I know I haven\u2019t, but I *feel* it.\n\nI\u2019m so lonely. So alone. I have literally no one in the world who I can turn to. In some ways that\u2019s how I like it. Can\u2019t get hurt if there\u2019s no one to hurt you. And people tend to be so very disappointing. I made the mistake of getting close to a very small handful of people, but they\u2019re all more or less out of my life now. Nothing happened. They\u2019re just gone. People always leave. I should never have let the wall down. I should know better by now than to let people in. I won\u2019t make that mistake ever again.\n\nThe only person I speak to at all is my fwb. Although there\u2019s not really a friendship there, so I guess \u201cfuck buddy\u201d would be a more apt description? In a fit of desperation, I messaged him to tell him I feel like I\u2019m getting fat and will be enormous by the time I leave here. I\u2019d hoped he would tell me not to worry about it, that I\u2019m a long way off from being fat, but he just said \u201cdon\u2019t do that. I like thin girls.\u201d Not what I was looking for, but I suppose I appreciate the honesty. Better than bullshit in any case.\n\nYesterday I was out with my father and somehow the topic of marriage cane up. Oh, I know. He brought up my desire to move to another country and asked if I\u2019d looked into how to go about it. I told him it\u2019s nearly impossible unless you marry into it. So he said I should try and meet someone while I\u2019m there, as I visit often. I told him that\u2019s ridiculous, because if I can\u2019t even find a husband here, how the hell am I meant to find one elsewhere? He said obviously I must not be trying hard enough and I need to put myself out there more. I told him that\u2019s bullshit. He asked what I think the problem is then. What\u2019s the problem?! I\u2019m not pretty enough, that\u2019s what the problem is! (I had to stop myself from the more blunt and more accurate reason: I\u2019m straight up fucking ugly. Because the one time I made the mistake of telling him I think I\u2019m ugly, he spent an hour lecturing me about how much it hurts *him* for me to say that and to never say it again. Because it\u2019s all about him and his feelings, you see.)\n\nHe, predictably, denied the fact that I\u2019m ugly and told me to work on my self-esteem, and, as always, \u201cjust don\u2019t feel that way anymore.\u201d Thanks dad, that\u2019s brilliant advice and my life\u2019s all sorted now!\n\nI\u2019m 30 years old. I can count on one hand the number of boyfriends I\u2019ve had. None has lasted longer than three months. They have all been unattractive, unintelligent, immature, and overall incompatible. As far as who shows an interest in me? Older men who are sick of their ageing nagging wives, elderly men who are senile and half blind, 20 year olds who live in their mom\u2019s basement and think that \u201cbeing in a band\u201d makes them God\u2019s gift, and creepy af random men who are disgusting and terrifying and only back off when I threaten to call the police (because, based on their behaviour, I think it\u2019s a pretty safe bet that this group of \u201csuitors\u201d have lengthy criminal records).\n\nWhy do I \u201cthink\u201d I\u2019m ugly? Gee, idk, it\u2019s an absolute fucking mystery. Oh wait, no it\u2019s not. Pretty girls can manage to find a decent boyfriend. They can manage to find several over the years. I cannot because I am a hideous fucking monster. Same reason I was always bullied when I was younger. Same reason every \u201cfriend\u201d I\u2019ve ever had has only been my \u201cfriend\u201d because they were using me.\n\nHe said he\u2019d \u201chelp me\u201d with whatever I need, which is a fucking joke. What I need is plastic surgery, which he could afford but most definitely won\u2019t agree to. What I need(ed) was that plastic surgery at least ten years ago, along with therapy. He wants to \u201chelp me\u201d now? It\u2019s a little bit goddamn late for that. I\u2019m beyond help now. I\u2019m too broken, and it\u2019s too late for me to be fixed. I should be married by now, I should have kids by now, I should be ok by now. But I\u2019m not. And I won\u2019t be, ever. And even if I could be, it\u2019s too late. Everything I ever wanted out of life is beyond my grasp now and I can\u2019t do a goddamn thing about it.\n\nI tried to help myself so hard for so long. I got myself into therapy from 18-25 with no help or involvement from my parents. I graduated uni, barely, as I was going very much insane. I somehow managed to survive round one of a raging eating disorder. I worked hard on myself. I tried. I failed. There is absolutely no point in trying again, anymore. There will be no happy ending. I\u2019m too far gone. I never even stood a chance. From the very day I was born, I was destined to end up like this. Crazy, miserable, alone. \n\nI can\u2019t wait to get home, away from my parents. Away from my father\u2019s disingenuous \u201cconcern\u201d and hollow offers of \u201chelp.\u201d Away from this fucking house. Away from their incessant questions (can\u2019t even take a piss without having to explain myself).\n\nI can\u2019t wait to starve. I think I will start purging again, because why not? As soon as I get home I\u2019m buying vodka and cigarettes (I don\u2019t smoke, but fuck it, I do now!)\n\nI can\u2019t wait to destroy myself completely. I can\u2019t wait to be gone. \n", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I\u2019m currently 23 and I\u2019ve been binging since I can remember. I was never really taught good eating habits and always relied on food for comfort. \n\nIn the last year, I lost 20lbs and then gained it all back. I had a severe episode of anxiety where I completely stopped eating and lost 10lbs as a result. Once I started treating my anxiety with medication, my doctor and me decided to tackle my adhd with adderall and as a result I ended up losing another 10lbs. \n\nWhen I was on adderall I found it really easy to combat intrusive compulsions to binge. I felt like I was a lot more in control of my impulses and as a result had far less trouble choosing healthy foods and appropriate portions. \n\nBut then, after a few months on it, I felt as though the therapeutic effects were lessening and some of the side effects were just more than I wanted to deal with so I stopped taking them (with the support of my psychiatrist ofc). \n\nAround that time I also was very stressed with school and work and had just left a toxic relationship. Soon enough I found myself going back to old habits and ended up gaining 20lbs\n\nI\u2019m really struggling here to figure out how to control my binge eating as I feel it is closely related to my adhd, anxiety and trauma. I\u2019m  currently successfully treating my anxiety and trauma but not so much the adhd. I want to gain control of this because I don\u2019t want such wild fluctuations in my weight if I go back on adderall and because I want to be able to control impulses and urges whether or not I am being medicated. I feel like I\u2019ve tried to find ways to combat my compulsive eating my whole life and nothing except treating my adhd with meds has worked. \n\nI really don\u2019t know what else to do.

After reading on weight loss groups about the dreaded plateaus that people deal with I was always horrified when my weight loss wasn\u2019t perfectly linear, and if the scale increased, even slightly, I\u2019d lose my mind. I guess I got so upset, in part, because I didn\u2019t trust my body. I didn\u2019t trust that it would cooperate and allow me to continue to lose weight. \n\nEach time that I freaked out though, the scale always eventually went down, and I started to feel a little less freaked out when it happened. So, I started tracking these fluctuations and it turns out (to absolutely no ones surprise, I\u2019m sure) that they occur alongside my cycle. My body refuses to lose right before my period, and whooshes after it\u2019s done, and I actually might gain a little before and during ovulation, and then have a big whoosh when I\u2019m done ovulating. \n\nI reached a new low weight yesterday and I was so hyped. Then this morning I stepped on the scale and I was .4 higher from that low weight. A few months ago, this would have had me crying and metaphorically tearing my hair out. This morning I just shrugged and said \u201covulation weight is a bitch, see you in a few days low weight\u201d. I trust that my body will let this weight go! I know what\u2019s happening, I know the pattern and I\u2019m not going to lose my mind over it. That feels pretty good!\n\nOf course in the back of my mind I\u2019m second guessing this calmness. Will I plateau for real this time? Is this upcoming whoosh going to be less significant because I wasn\u2019t able to workout as hard and as much as usual last week? Did I miscalculated my calories? The difference is, these thoughts are in the BACK of my mind, and not steering the ship anymore! \n\n\n", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I went to check on her and she was sitting at the bar at top and said that the music was too loud, and I had to play along like \"yeah...my ears are ringing too!\" like I was not aware why she needed to sit down. \n\nI felt like I had to be an advocate for her in secret but it triggered me so much because I felt like the fat friend.

Now I found this sub and I feel like I relate to so much of it even though I kind of feel like an impostor. But I just feel like since high school I haven't been able to fully focus on my life. Like all I can think about is my weight. I weigh myself every day, usually more than once but I've been trying to limit that. I'm trying really hard to stop with the binge eating but man it's like a voice in my head just telling me it's fine, just do it. And as I gained weight it's like I felt like I deserved it, like I was becoming who I actually was all along. I'm so mad at myself for letting it get so out of control, but still feeling even more justified in my dysmorphia because now it's true, I really am fat. ugh.

I\u2019ve never admitted this to anyone and I feel so fucked up. I\u2019m a 26 year old woman who had been overweight all of my life up until four years ago when I decided to make a change. I counted calories, started exercising and lost \u00a025 kg (about 55 lbs). Now my BMI is in the normal range - but ever since, I\u2019ve obsessed over staying thin, yet still wanting to maintain my eating habits of when I was bigger. Not easy. I eventually figured out a \u201chack\u201d to make this happen: I\u2019d basically binge in such an amount that my stomach literally couldn\u2019t contain anymore contents. Often this would consists of having a large dinner, followed by a large dessert; perhaps a bag of M&amp;Ms or 4-5 candy bars. I\u2019d also make sure to drink a LOT of diet soda throughout the binge.\n\nWhat follows is going to sound so messed up, it\u2019s difficult to even type it. But my stomach would be overflowing to such an extent that food would just start coming back up my esophagus - usually whenever I\u2019d be burping. The carbonation in the large amounts of diet soda I drank would help push the food back up my throat. And the more I practiced this, the \u2018better\u2019 I got at it. I learned to almost effortlessly use my stomach and throat muscles to push the food back up. After about half an hour of this process, I would have managed to throw up at least \u00a02/3 of my meal this way. Completely undigested and the process was completely painless.\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t do this very much anymore, since I got into a serious relationship and am now living with my partner. But my relationship with food is forever strained. I am extremely uncomfortable eating in front of others and try to avoid it at all cost. I still count calories every day. I don\u2019t own a scale any longer, but I measure my waist/hips almost every morning. When I\u2019m alone, I still repeat this messed up eating/purge pattern sometimes. Sometimes I hate myself for doing it. Other times I feel like I\u2019ve just found a neat hack to eat what I want and not gain weight. It\u2019s weird.\u00a0\n\nNot sure what the point of this post was. I guess I just I never considered whether this was an eating disorder until recently. And if so, what kind of eating disorder would it even be? Some fucked up version of bulimia? I don't even know. I just needed to get this off my chest.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I've been trying to understand what drives my ED for years, it keeps changing &amp; morphing: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- feeling pride, comfort, or elation when you realize you\u2019ve gone X hours without eating. Feeling a heightened sense of pride when you realize during those X hours, you didn\u2019t even think of food.\u00a0\n\n\\- substituting actual successes with eating disorder successes. When you have a nonproductive day at work, thinking\u00a0\u201cWell at least I ate below 500cal today, so the day isn\u2019t a complete failure\u201d. Slowly the eating disorder successes start to take over in place of actual success and becomes your life. The world gets smaller with an eating disorder.\u00a0\n\n\\- being unable to sustain a romantic relationship because there is no one who will love you as intensely, as passionately, as closely as your disorder. The allure of sex pales in comparison to thinking about the food you\u2019ll allow yourself to eat after the next hour and forty-four minutes pass. \n\n\\- breaking up with someone because they distract you from maintaining your relationship with your disorder. They try to help you because they care about you, but you reject them. Having a decreased sex drive because your body is starving and your BMI is 15.8.\u00a0\n\n\\- feeling superhuman when you watch other people eat. Because if you need less resources, if you\u2019re different than the fools who need food to survive, what are you but superhuman, above it all?\u00a0\n\n\\- clinging to your disorder because it gives you an identity, albeit a pointless one. Feeling like you haven\u2019t accomplished enough, that you aren\u2019t important enough, that you\u2019re not good enough compared to everyone else - and thus you don\u2019t have an identity to call your own. You\u2019re not yet \u201cthe record holder for X sport\u201d or\u00a0\u201cthe Pulitzer prize winning journalist\u201d or\u00a0\u201cthe bestselling author\u201d or \"the scientist with 3 published papers\". So you embrace your disorder because at least you\u2019ll be\u00a0\u201cthe skinny and ... sort of successful X\u201d\u00a0\n\n\\- seeing a super thin girl walk past you in the subway station and being unsure if you\u2019re attracted to girls, or if you just want her body specifically. Trying not to appear as \"creepy\" by continuing to stare at her thigh gap and the bit of collarbone that\u2019s showing under her blouse.\u00a0Looking away when she meets your eyes briefly, and now you know that she knows that you know - that you are both wasting away. \n\n\\- seeing a super thin girl walk past you and becoming competitive with her internally. \n\n\\- when your bones start to lose density and you can feel the aches when you\u2019re trying to go to bed and you contemplate starting melatonin because you have to wake up at 6am for work the next day\n\n\\- infiltrating the world of keto dieters, vegans, marathon runners, ballet dancers, people who fast for health or clearer thinking \u2026 because then you somewhat fit in. Browsing r/fasting or r/1200isplenty or r/intermittentfasting because you\u2019re trying to fool yourself into thinking what you\u2019re doing has a silver lining. \n\n\\- lying to yourself by thinking that once you hit X weight, all your problems will magically be solved.\u00a0\n\n\\- developing avoidant attachment style because the moment you let someone in, they destroy the illusion of control you have over your life that your disorder grants you.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I'd hang out with them for a few hours, make up an excuse and leave without getting in contact with them. It was mostly the anxiety that I'd be too tubby a guy for them, even though the guys I knew who were bigger than me, all had dates and girlfriends. I was afraid that even if they liked my personality, they'd be revolted by my body. So I left before anything ever happened, and so every date eluded me.\n\nThis grew into the fear that they'd dislike who I was anyway, but that aside. \n\nSo I'm hanging out with the friend from the first paragraph and I thought I'd invite the girl I crushed on. She came and we talked about dumb things, it was great. I went off for a smoke and when I came back, they were making out.

Even if you supplement electrolytes you will likely still run into health complications down the road. However, supplementing electrolytes can greatly prevent life-threatening complications.**\n\nThe main reason I felt compelled to make this post is because I noticed a common trend across ED forums and ED social media is obsession about hydration. It's practically a meme at this point. Don't get me wrong hydration is super important and you shouldn't take it lightly. However, particularly for eating disorder sufferers excess consumption of water can be harmful due to the fact that when you urinate you are flushing electrolytes out of your body. For healthy individuals this isn't a problem because they restore their electrolyte balance through their diet. On the other hand for people that regularly low restrict, fast, or purge you are likely losing electrolytes at a faster rate then you are replenishing them. This can cause serious complications with your health if you don't address it.\n\n#**The Electrolytes**\n\nYour body requires several chemicals known as electrolytes to function properly.\n\n* Potassium\n\n* Sodium\n\n* Calcium\n\n* Magnesium\n\n* Chloride\n\n* Hydrogen Phosphate\n\n* Hydrogen Carbonate\n\n#**Possible Health Complications**\n\nElectrolytes are essential for the healthy function of your nerve, heart, and muscle cells. Failure to maintain a proper balance can result in the damage or failure of these organs. A study by Dr. Scott Crow and his colleagues in 1997 determined that nearly 50% of the bulimic patients in his study had chronic electrolyte deficiencies.\n\nCommon complications as a result of electrolyte imbalance can include:\n\n###***Hypokalemia*** - Abnormally low potassium levels (&lt;3.5mmol/L)\n\nCommon Symptons\n\n* Fatigue/weakness\n* Constipation\n* Muscle cramps\n* High blood pressure\n* Abnormal heart rhythmn\n* Hyporeflexia (loss of natural reflexes)\n* Flaccid paralysis\n* Cardiac arrest\n\nCommon causes for those with an ED\n\n* Prolonged fasting and low restriction\n\n* No carb diets\n\n* Low magnesium (a nutrient necessary to properly process potassium)\n\n* Metabolic alkalosis (can result from excessive vomiting)\n\n***Hypokalemia is particularly nefarious because symptoms usually do not manifest until the levels become dangerously low***\n\n###***Hyponatremia*** - Abnormally low sodium levels (&lt;135mmol/L)\n\nCommon Symptoms\n\n* Nausea/vomiting\n\n* Headaches, dizziness, and confusion\n\n* Fatigue\n\n* Loss of appetite\n\n* Muscle weakness and/or spasms and cramps\n\n* Hernia in brain\n\n* Fluids in lungs\n\n* Osteoporosis and bone fractures\n\n* Neurological impairment and brain damage\n\nCommon causes for those with ED\n\n* Excessive vomiting, sweating, use of diuretics, lax abuse, excessive water consumption\n\n###***Hypocalcaemia*** - Abnormally low calcium levels (&lt;2.1mmol/L)\n\nCommon Symptoms\n\n* Muscle spasms\n* Cardiac arrest\n* Seizures\n* Confusion\n\nCommon causes for those with ED\n\n* Excessive use of laxitives\n\n* Metabolic alkalosis (often caused by excessive vomiting, dehydration, or diuretic abuse)\n\n* Magnesium deficiency    \n\n###***Hypochloremia*** - Abnormally low chloride levels (&lt;97mmol/L)\n\nCommon Symptoms\n\n* Dehydration and fluid loss\n\n* Fatigue and weakness\n\n* High blood pressure\n\n* Difficulty breathing\n\nCommon causes for those with ED\n\n* Excessive vomiting, sweating, lax abuse, diuretic abuse \n\n###***Metabolic Alkalosis*** - Dangerous rise in the pH levels of organ tissue\n\nCommon Symptoms\n\n* Low potassium\n\n* Muscular weakness, cramping, and pain\n\n* Low calcium\n\n* Abnormal heart rhythmns\n\n* Coma\n\n* Seizures\n\nCommon causes for those with ED\n\n* Excessive vomiting, dehydration, diuretic abuse\n\n* Low magnesium\n\n###***Metabolic Acidosis*** - Dangerously low pH levels of organ tissue\n\nCommon Symptoms\n\n* Coma\n\n* Chest pain\n\n* Heart palpitations\n\n* Hypoxia\n\n* Osteoporosis\n\nCommon causes for those with ED\n\n* Laxative abuse\n\n#**Ways to Supplement Your Electrolytes**\n\nObviously the best way to do this is through a healthy diet and proper hydration, however, that is likely not going to be the reality for many here. I highly recommend if you are able to get bloodwork done by your general practitioner even if you don't think you're \"sick enough\". There is no way to know for sure what your electrolyte levels are without proper lab work and life-threatening consequences can suddenly occur without warning for electrolyte deficiencies. These complications can occur at any weight and it is better to be safe than sorry. \n\nOverall the best way I have found to increase electrolyte consumption is through mixing the electrolytes with water. One popular method that I do is through this recipe called \"Snake Juice\". It sounds hella sketchy and like some crash diet you'd find in the back of a tabloid. Despite its name it does help with replenishing electrolytes far more efficiently and economically than chugging Gatorade or expensive tablets. The most common recipe for 2L of water is as follows:\n\n*Water=2L*\n\n*Potassium chloride =1 tsp/6g*\n\n*Sodium chloride = 1/2 tsp/3g*\n\n*Sodium Bicarbonate = 1 tsp/5g*\n\n*Magnesium Sulphate = 1/2 tsp/2-3g*\n\nEverything you need can be found at your local supermarket. I use table salt for sodium, NuSalt for potassium, and baking soda for the bicarbonate. I also supplement with calcium and magnesium tablets on a semi-regular basis. The taste is a little weird at first, but if you are using the correct ratios it shouldn't be too unpalatable. Please make sure to properly measure out the quantities when you mix it in water. Although uncommon, it is still possible to overdo it which can cause problems of its own. Please take note if you start to have unexplained diarrhea.\n\n#**Also, if you flush, this should be mandatory. Flushing is among the most dangerous of all purging habits.**\n\nA great resource is the [USDA Dietary Reference Intake Calculator](https://fnic.nal.usda.gov/fnic/dri-calculator/). This calculator will give you a good idea of your ideal nutrient intake based on your stats.\n\n[Chronometer](https://cronometer.com/) is another fantastic resource. It's similar to MFP and LoseIt but it has a much greater focus on marconutrients and micronutrients.\n\nIf I have included any misinformation please PM me and I will edit.

{"post_id": "b5xeso", "created_utc": 1553645402, "title": "On college, failure and exhaustion", "author": "CS191", "self_text": "Hey y\u2019all. Here with a rant on college, EDs and exhaustion. Featuring the long story of my ED. \n\nSo all my life I prided myself on being smart. I was always praised for it, I loved learning, I had a curiosity that nothing and no one could satisfy. Since I can remember, I dreamed of college, I would see people on TV and movies in colleges and Ivy Leagues, with the buildings and everyone being so smart and I couldn\u2019t wait to be there. At some point, I realised just how hard it would be for me, a poor non-American student, to make it, but I worked my ass off. Somewhere along the way, I started succeeding, around junior year everything was going great (college-wise) and it seemed like I might actually make it. \n\nOnto the ED. I\u2019ve had episodes of disordered eating since I was around 11, but they never lasted longer than a few weeks. I\u2019d hate my body, restrict for a while, get depressed, eat my feelings, go back to eating normally, and regain whatever weight I\u2019d lost. On and on and on for years. \n\nAs I said, junior year was going well, academically. Around this time, a friend told me she had a crush on me, so I was forced to face my repressed sexuality and come out to myself, before telling her I liked her back. I fucked that up, badly. A few months later, I was a mess, she moved on, I broke my own heart by being stupid. \n\nStress was high, self esteem was low, I tried to lose weight to win her back, I failed. Summer before senior year was probably my worst eating wise. I was at my highest weigh, and while at summer camp I lost like 5 kg in four weeks. Not impressive for most, but it was for me, as my parents closely watch what I eat at home. College app stress, and trying to get another chance with this girl kept me restricting pretty badly that fall (2017). \n\nCome November, all my chances with her go flying out the window. Come December, I get rejected from my dream school. Come March, I fuck up the one thing I worked for all my high school years because anti-depressants were fucking with my brain. Shortly after, all my other colleges reject or waitlist me. I was so depressed, I could barely get out of bed. In the summer, my waitlists turned into rejections, and I went back to eating my feelings. I watched all my friends being happy and successful, all while I hated myself more than ever before. \n\nSomewhere in the summer, I tried to get better, ditch the unhealthy coping mechanisms, try to get into college again, love myself, all that jazz. I failed. I fell into my current and worst ED episode. I hated myself so much, still do. It felt like I was defined by a number, and it wasn\u2019t good enough, for college, for my achievements, for what people thought of me. Everything I once prided myself on was taken from me, so I turned to a number I could control, my weight. I felt like everyone around me pitied me, and I just wanted to try and be beautiful, so everyone would think I wasn\u2019t miserable trash and they would still admire me for something. \n\nIt kinda worked, I spend every waking minute thinking about food, my weight, and calories. It\u2019s much more pleasant than thinking about how big a failure I am, how I fucked up my future and all my hopes and dreams. For a few months I managed, I was restricting, losing weight, working on my college apps, succeeding in the classes I\u2019m taking. December brought me my first rejection of this cycle, and even though I expected it, it hit me so much harder than I thought. \n\n2019 has been terrible. I\u2019m sad every waking moment, I\u2019m still obsessing over food, but I\u2019m barely losing weight, which was at least a small comfort and something to look forward to. I\u2019ve distanced myself from all my friends because I can\u2019t stand watching them being so happy. I\u2019ve gotten two more rejections and one waitlist, with only one decision to go. Needless to say, I\u2019ve never felt like such a failure. The worst thing, and kinda the purpose of this rant is how tired I am. \n\nI\u2019m tired mentally, I\u2019m taking some courses that involve mindless work, I have no energy or drive to find ways to challenge myself. It seems like the three neurons left in my brain have quit on me, thinking feels like moving through jello. Emotionally, I\u2019m lonely, I\u2019m tired of failing, of not being good enough for anyone or anything, of failing at what seems like everything I ever wanted to achieve. Physically, I can barely get out of bed. I\u2019m so desperate for energy, I tried upping my intake, it didn\u2019t work, I stopped working out, didn\u2019t work, I went back to working out, didn\u2019t work. I\u2019m just dragging myself day after day, being miserable. I feel like exhaustion has seeped into my bones, and I miss who I was before, though sometimes I can barely remember her. \n\nThis whole post is a mess, I am a mess, I don\u2019t know why I felt compelled to spend like an hour of my life writing out my life story for strangers on the internet to read, but I wanted to get it all out. My last college decision is Thursday, and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do after getting rejected. I\u2019ll probably go on with my misery, stay subscribed to ApplyingToCollege because watching others succeed while I am a total failure is my favourite way to trigger myself into starvation. \n\nThanks for reading if you made it this far.\n\nTL;DR: College rejections triggered my ED as a way to prove I was good enough for something, and one year later I\u2019m likely getting rejected from all colleges again. Also I\u2019m exhausted in every way, and I like ranting to strangers on the internet. ", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I have always trained like crazy in order to succeed, and in turn i am at the top of my age group- train insane or remain the same, right? Well, i developed a serious ED in ninth grade. I was severely depressed and wanted to get back on track, so I began eating healthy and training regularly again. This quickly developed into a strict eating and training regimen that then developed further into an ED. I restricting my eating so much that I lost a lot of weight while already being at the lowest BMI for my height. I was always fatigued and was underweight with no period and hair loss while I competed regularly. Eventually, it became more about the exercise than the food: I would train for hours upon hours a day to cope with my depression and mental health issues. I would swim twice in one night alone, swim during my school lunch break, and even skip class to get a workout in. On Christmas Eve, my local pool was closed and it sent me into a panic attack. I pleaded with my mom and begged until she drove me to a pool in another CITY just so that i could \u201cearn my meal.\u201d This behaviour continued all the way until Championships for competitive swimming in the summer. Due to my unhealthy addiction to training, I was over prepared for the meet. I won my races by entire lengths of the pool and broke records in nearly all of my events. I didn\u2019t care. I wasn\u2019t training to succeed\u2014 i was training to be skinny. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that, I started getting better. Sports took a break for a month and my life felt like it was back on track. Even when they started again, I felt in control. I was able to tell myself that I didn\u2019t need the extra workout, I didn\u2019t need to go to the pool, that I was so much happier without it. I was able to calm the little voices that egged me to train. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, i have recently been presented with an opportunity to qualify for National Championships for triathlon in my country. Of course I said yes right away, but since then i have been downright miserable. I\u2019ve been training twice a day and can feel myself being pulled back into the dark world of punishing exercise.

I am suffocating and am wondering what the point even is if i\u2019m sacrificing my health and wellbeing all for a workout in the pool. Every fiber of my being tells me to quit. I know that I will be so much happier and well off if i retire from my sports, but I have an attachment to them\u2014 they have been my life for the past 10 years. Despite this, they are an outlet in which to channel my ED, and I know that if I keep training like this it will take me down a very dark path. I can\u2019t do this anymore. I want to be able to sleep in on the weekends, and spend time with friends, and be able to take only one shower a day. I want to focus on school, and have time for a job, and exercise when I want to, not because I feel that I need to. I want to lead a normal life. I don\u2019t care if i lose my status as an athlete, I never cared about that anyway. I want to get better. I need to get better.

I ate so much McDonalds that I became sicker than I ever could imagine, I felt like I was out of my mind to the point where everything around me was blurry and I felt like I was drugged. That was the day that I decided I was not going to live through torture any longer. My binge eating disorder started when I started doing the whole \u201cI am going to strictly eat healthy foods through the week but eat whatever and however much for I want on the weekends.\u201d I started this because I was surrounded by people who did this, so I assumed that it was the right thing to do in ordered to stay in shape. First of all, I never really needed to even lose weight to begin with, there was nothing wrong with my body even if I didn\u2019t love it, I didn\u2019t need to make any drastic changes. I started using My Fitness Pal and let me just tell you that using apps and counting calories like this is horrible for you. From my personal experience I feel like counting calories and paying way too much attention to what you eat is what starts all of this. You end up eating over your suggested calories and then just say \u201cscrew it\u201d and eat more than you should. Then you get upset with yourself for eating more than you needed and you try HARDER the next day, making things only harder on yourself to the point where it can become a repeating cycle. The \u201ccheat days\u201d would be ridiculous, I would buy so much food that I couldn\u2019t finish in one day, I\u2019d get so uncomfortabley full that I felt like garbage. The food would still be left in the house and I\u2019d continue to eat it the next few days even though I promised that I wouldn\u2019t do it, leading me to say screw it again and force more food down my throat bc I told myself \u201cthis is the last time never again, I\u2019ll only eat health foods\u201d and I would continue to do this until I found myself in a huge hole that felt impossible to be dug out of. It really felt like food was starting to control my life because I couldn\u2019t go more than 3 days without bingeing out of control on food. I tried stopping several times, which attempting to stop is great progress and anyone who does this should be proud. I finally was able to discover the book Brain Over Binge which changed my life and brought me to where I am today. I tried therapy, it didn\u2019t work(at least for me), all it did was tell me to go back to a normal diet and basically have me the same information that the internet could give me and all the other emotional bullshit. However going  back to a normal \u201cdiet\u201d is super helpful, you SHOULD avoid counting calories and caring about the nutrition in the food, for the time being, that way you can get used to eating normally again. The book Brain Over Binge basically teaches you to rewire your brain and breaks the urges to eat in your brain. I constantly had these strong urges telling me to go eat, even when I wasn\u2019t hungry at all. It may take some time to get yourself properly trained to do this, but even after reading a short amount of this book, I made so much progress. It basically explains that there isn\u2019t any excuse to not recover, to stop using your emotions as an excuse as to why you have BED, it\u2019s something programmed into your brain, your emotions have NOT caused an eating disorder. While your emotions can trigger a binge, they most likely are NOT what started your BED. I tried and failed probably a countless amount of times to beat BED, but it only took me about 3 attempts with this book to get me to where I am today, and I am proud to say that I am about 98% BED free and I say 98% bc I still sometimes overeat or eat when I\u2019m not super hungry, but it\u2019s nothing compared to any kind of crazy binge or any of the horrible stuff I went through. I hope my advice can help anyone who reads this. ", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

{"post_id": "b6ehnj", "created_utc": 1553747973, "title": "Intuitive Eating vs Meal Plans. And a vent?", "author": "TeenageGingerTurtle", "self_text": "Hey guys! First I'd like to say that I'm really glad that I've found this community. I've been struggling with a relapse for a few months and am currently trying to claw my way back up (mentally and physically). It is still some time however until I can join an outpatient program offered in my city, so I'm happy to have found a place where I can relate to others!\nTW: vague mention of some behaviors, but no specifics.\nSo here is my current cononundrum: I need to gain some weight again. Which means I need to eat more food. For the past year and a half I've been below my set point (no period, low energy, overexercising, etc) with a slight dip in the last few months during a period travelling abroad. Before this trip I was maintaining a decent eating schedule (enough to maintain, but not pushing myself, lots of food rules/fears) but while abroad I started doing IF and restricting the amount of times I ate per day, at first to save money (but we all know where these things go). I was also walking and hiking EVERYWHERE. \nSince coming home, reality has hit and it's time to get back on track and get my weight back where it needs to be. At 20 years old, I want to have a period, want to have a libido, eat late night pizza and drink wine with my friends, dance till 4am, focus on my creative pursuits, and not have to constantly worry about my bones or heart muscles deteriorating. I dont want to spend my early twenties being afraid I'll die in my sleep.\nSo to do that, it's time to get my eating game on again. I've done it before, so I know I can do it again, but I'm really struggling because I don't have access to a treatment team like I did the first time around, nor are my parents willing to get as involved as they did when I was young. \nFor a while I wanted to use intuitive eating to conquer my food fears and rules (mostly on food timing and food types. I've been struggling with orthorexia to varying degrees for 7 years now). I'm a huge fan of Christy Harrison and her podcasts, where I first learned about the concept. I keep waiting and waiting for my body to start asking for more food, to essentially \"force\" me to start physically recovering, but I'm reluctantly beginning to realize that that's not going to happen. My appetite isn't starting up, and I'm not getting intense cravings. I'm not normally hungry for 3 meals a day, nevermind the 6 I used to eat 2 years ago. And its stressful because how does one intuit an appetite that doesnt send them any signals? It feels wrong eating when neither my body nor my brain is asking for anything.\nI'm hesitant to use a meal plan too, because in the past I've become very obsessed and rigid with meal plans and timing. I know that eating at scheduled times will get my appetite roaring again, but I'm afraid of turning my meal plan into another cage as I've done before. I also won't be able to see a dietitian for a few months.\nI've also looked into Minniemaud, but with all of the negative backlash surrounding it, I'm very hesitant to try that too.\nAll of this bandying about in my brain is definitely me just putting the weight gain process off. As much as I want it, it terrifies me. But I know it needs to happen, so I just have to roll up my shirtsleeves, stop complaining/making things difficult, and get to work. I just dont know how.\nHas anyone else been through a similar situation? Which route did you take? Does anyone have any good meal plans they can maybe suggest as an example/template?\n\nTLDR: OP is trying to gain weight after an extended relapse and is frozen in deciding what the best method is, and using that paralysis to stall progress. Using a lack of mental/physical hunger to justify not following a regular eating schedule. Looking for meal-planning resources and wondering what route others took in their recovery!

I feel there is an appalling lack of literature on the risks of developing gastroparesis from eating disorders. I\u2019ve been told 25% of cases of gastroparesis are caused by EDs.\n\nWhat is gastroparesis?\nIt\u2019s is a condition where the stomach loses the ability to move food through it effectively. Food stays in the stomach for an extended period of time. This causes severe pain, nausea, vomiting, and bloating. Many people with gastroparesis lose the ability to eat all together and must be on feeding tubes or they will die. They cannot digest on their own. The stomach can recover in patients with ED induced gastroparesis. Generally studies show that with increase in nutrition and weight the stomach slowly begins to regain function. \n\nWhy is this important?\nI see a lot of people with stomach discomfort, who are bloated or constipated and turn to laxatives. Bad news is, if you have gastroparesis the pills just chill in your stomach and take hours and hours to empty and begin to work. You can actually overdose with some medications because you will retain several dosages and release them at once. \n\nThere\u2019s hope!\nCheck out the gastroparesis diet. It has levels, one with liquids, one semi-liquid, one soft. Lots of foods, and lots of ways to just drink low cal stuff. That will help constipation and bloating. To fix the condition it needs management through gastroenterology and nutrition. So if you continue to struggle, please seek a doctors advice. \n\nPlease just be aware this condition exists and a large portion of its suffers have or had disordered eating. I just want you guys to have happy tummies.\n\n-with love from someone with gastroparesis", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I KNOW if I lose more weight I'll be objectively underweight. and yet it seems like every one around me but my bf thinks I'm an obese lump whos lazy and sits in bed all day???? they've always pushed me to \"eat healthier/less\" and exersize. when I was little I was so underweight it was a joke between me and a friend. I was maybe... 85? 90? lbs in 7th grade. i gained a TON of weight when my PTSD devolped. dont wanna go into it but I was forced to live w some one and basicly only ate gnocchi pasta and cupcakes lmao. I ate a ton of junk food when I could go home and only rlly ate carbs when I wasnt and I went from under 100 to around 160 in like 2 years. my parents were openly upset abt me gaining weight???? my mom got onto me anytime I ate sweets or soda, juice etc. shed get mad bc I didnt get out and walk as much- because I was fucking terrified to even ho to school bc of my abuser. It??? kills me that she thinks I'm just a lazy fat ass who just dosnt wanna leave my room idk ", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

But we're ABSOLUTELY NOT SUPPOSED TO SPEAK ABOUT IT??

I look in the  mirror and I see a bloated body, but I also see small muscles forming again. My ECGs are normal now, my failing kidneys, bladder, heart &amp; liver are all improving. My seizures stopped. 40 lbs in a month of water, fat and muscle is a LOT of weight gain, but I was also dehydrated, bordering on catatonic &amp; generally, frankly, dying. My weight is now naturally falling again and my loose skin is improving - so it wasn't true weight.\n\nI was starting to slip back into relapse, but I looked at the photo on the left again, yesterday. Back then, all I saw was fat. A disgustingly fat face, but now I see how gaunt and sickly I actually looked. I don't want to be dying, being threatened with a tube, feeling like life is nothing but lethargy. I couldn't even play video games, or work on any art (two favorite hobbies), as I had so little energy. My days were spent in bed. Finally started drawing again, and playing again. \n\nIdk what the point of this post is, maybe to try and inspire someone else to take that leap, too.

Every time I cook or make or get any food (or drink) and she is there, she questions what I'm making or using - fine by me, this is common in my house.  But I've been noticing that only she asks for a bite of whatever it is every. single. time. Even if I have something half ready (like set aside to mix with something else) she'll ask for a bite. A bite of what I've measured out to the teaspoon, what I've prepared specifically so it fits in my cals. \n\nNow honestly this probably shouldn't be a big deal (technically she make me eat less!), but it kills me because she also feels the need to point out the 'weird' (read: not processed) ingredients I use, tell me she's never heard of it or doesn't know how to make it (even when I know she's had them before - like off of my plate), and then will eat some and say 'hm.. I'd rather have a...' or 'it tastes odd' or 'I can't get past the texture'.  Like I KNOW you don't like my food! So why do you feel the need to eat it!\n\nYesterday I was cooking tempeh to put in a salad, and had cooked it and left it in the pan (but with the burner off) while preparing the rest.  She has bought this exact brand herself before, has had mine before, and still wandered over and looked into the pan and said 'oh wow this smells good but looks so different without sauce, how did you make it'.  Told her it was just plain with some salt &amp; pepper. She asks if she can try it as she's already got her hand on a piece IN THE PAN.  Then later that night, I decided if I walk to the far grocery store I can get halo top (which is my crack and I haven't had it in god knows how long).  I took the pint out of the freezer and let it sit on my desk (in my room) for a little while I cleaned up.  Then she came in, started talking to me and I cleaned, and looked right at the unopened pint and asked me about it.  Took the lid off, commented on how light it feels, how weird and proteiny halo top tastes, and then asks if she can try some.  I tell her it's bad when it's frozen and has to sit.  She says I don't care and asks again so what else do I say but sure.... opens the pint and pries out a huge scoop :)\n\nThis get too long I'm sorry but sometimes I literally wait until she's out of the house to eat because I just can't stand it.

{"post_id": "b6yd79", "created_utc": 1553871813, "title": "Open Letter to The Sick Kids in Uni", "author": "trashy_panda", "self_text": "This long as FUCK letter is brought to you by both my experience completing uni with an ED, and working years later on a campus, also with an ED. Now, I finished my Bachelors in Sport and Exercise Science (EL OH EL) while at the height of my restrictive phase (can someone fill me in on what we learned in year 2 and 3? Because I have no fucking clue..), but I currently work at a different university in Australia. I work in what is essentially the dining hall (El Oh El: Part 2). LET US BEGIN.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, my perspective as a student. University is fucking hard as shit, but if you're doing any sort of studying, go you. If you're studying while dealing with an ED, GO YOU! That ish is next to impossible. I legitimately cannot tell you anything I learned in Year 2 or 3 of my degree, because I ate so little my brain could barely comprehend the steps I needed to take to get me to and from class. The tensor fasciae latae, is that the new drink at Starbucks? How many calories are in a tall? CAN IT BE SUGAR FREE??? I had to change my major because I was pulled from certain classes due to being too ill. In the end, did I graduate? Yeah. However, I would likely be in a far better position today if I had taken care of myself then, postponed classes, and completed my degree when it could no longer feed my disorder. That fucker LIVED for stress and ohmahgawd, is uni full of that shit. I'm not saying everyone should drop what they're doing, get themselves in recovery, and then come back when they're \"cured\". But if you find yourself significantly worse when classes are in session, it may be in your best interest, mentally, physically, and educationally(?) to postpone your studies for a while, or see if your institution offers some forms of counseling you can attend for free/cheap. Obviously this isn't ED exclusive, but I wish someone had given me the option when I was a student. Maybe I wouldn't be so screwed now. \n\n\n\n\n\nPart Dos: The Outsider. I work at a relatively small uni in Queensland, so the chances of anyone on here attending mine is slim. But if you do, shout out to my homies! This weathers been fuckin shit, eh? Anyways, moving on. Working in the dining hall, I see mostly the On Campus kids come in for all their meals. To those of you with ED's, I see you. And I don't judge you. I've been you. I see you order your tiny buffet plate and only take the salad and steamed veg for every meal, or order the grilled tofu with just the green beans and broccoli. We are the same broken spirit (gross, sorry). I can see you're struggling and I want to ask if you're doing ok; if there's anything I can do or if you just need to talk. But I know that won't help either of us. Again, I'm not judging you (I judge the people who have literally never ordered a vegetable from me once, like how are you even alive??? The garnish doesn't count as a serve? Guac is not a complete vegetable??). The other girls at work don't seem to notice, I'm just hyper-aware, sorry. Uni is hard, especially when you're so far from home. My only hope for now is that you don't stop coming in. If nothing else, I wanna see you come in and order that tofu and veg. I'm silently cheering you on. I know carbs can be scary, but try and add a little extra right now, because exams are coming up next week. Carbs are brain fuel, and without em, next week is gonna BLOW. EVEN. HARDER. I realize theres other ED's happening around campus that I don't recognize as readily, I found someones binge trash in a toilet stall last week. I feel that shit in my soul, and you are not alone in what you're going through, I promise.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegardless of if you're in uni, high school, or finished with that trash years ago, your friendly neighbourhood trash hoe, trashy_panda, hopes you're doin ok. I mean, I just binged and purged like an hour ago so I'm talkin shit. But I'm silently here for you, hoping you have the courage and strength that I didn't.\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for coming to my TED Talk.  ", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

This in between recovery state means that narrowing my safe foods down even further doesn\u2019t sound very fun either and I want to feel relatively sane when I go out to eat with people, but I also don\u2019t think any of that is a valid reason for me to use and sacrifice another being\u2019s life and experience on earth. The more I think about this whole thing the more anxious I become and the more I wanna starve lol.\n\nIdk what do y\u2019all think?", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I knew I had to set some personal rules in order to stop this from happening. Here's what's been helping me so far.\n\n1. Eat only at the table with no distractions\n\nMy binges usually take place by bringing snacks up to my dark room and watching Youtube until I pass out in a food coma. Therefore,  by limiting my eating to the kitchen, I eliminate a factor that increases my chances of binging. And I don't know about you guys, but when I binge I'm usually watching some form of entertainment as another means to distract me from my real problems. If I have nothing to pay attention to except the food in front of me, then it makes me more mindful of what and how much of it I'm putting into my body.\n\n2. Try to eat meals with others around\n\nIt's not always possible, but if you have the chance to eat with someone, do it! I know I would *never* binge in front of anyone, not even those closest to me. It's an incredibly embarrassing low moment for us bingers, so the less time you get to eat alone, the better it will be for you in the long run. Plus conversation during a meal will slow down the rate at which you eat, which will make you fuller sooner and more mindful of each bite.\n\n3. Herbal tea!\n\nWhen I feel like mindlessly snacking, I now boil a pot of tea and sip on it while I'm doing a task. It gives me something to do, feels great, and tastes wonderful. Also helps with debloating!  \n\n4. Calorie counting\n\nThis might come as a surprise since I see this causes a lot of people to binge more, but for me it actually does the opposite. I'm very bad at mental math, so if I don't know an estimate of how many calories I've had throughout the day, I get frustrated and spiral into a binge. Having a counter that keeps me accountable has helped me immensely. I personally love \nCronometer because I am vegan &amp; I like to keep track of all the nutrients to see if I'm in need of more or less of certain things.\n\n5. Foods with high water content\n\nIf you feel like you really need to snack without any restriction, go for something with high water content. These foods take much longer to fill you up, have minimal calories, and won't make you so bloated. Stick to fruits and veggies. Be careful if you use dipping sauces of any kind, those calories can sneak up on you.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

It\u2019s gonna be a long one. \n\n\nThroughout my disorder I\u2019ve always been overweight. It started out binge eating, I had gained weight from antidepressants and my mother tried to force me on diets. She would restrict my food intake and it just made everything worse. I would horde food and money and use it to buy more food at school. I remember my mom used to let me have 2 eggo waffles each morning. So I would make 4, quickly shove 2 in my mouth and chew as fast as I could so she didn\u2019t catch me. \n\nI always had the stupid stereotypical thoughts about how I want to lose weight, \u201cmight as well just be anorexic.\u201d It was so stupid of me to ever think that would work out. No matter how little I ate, I always binged and the scale went up. When that number went up, it\u2019s like it correlated with my self hatred. I thought losing weight would help me love myself.\n\nThat was absolute bullshit. I\u2019ve struggled so much the last 6 years with absolutely nothing to show except for internal damage, and how the memories haunt me of my organs failing. I remember overdosing on diet pills and vyvanse in the school bathroom. They couldn\u2019t even get an IV in me because my pulse was so strong, blood pressure 210/160. I remember having to consume 800mg of caffeine just to function and exercise, but never getting warm enough to stop my nails from turning blue. I remember going to the hospital because my kidneys were failing. What little urine I made was brown and smelled like burnt rubber. All because I couldn\u2019t stop taking laxatives. \n\nAnd I have nothing to show for that. No \u201cbeautiful\u201d physique like people think. No weight loss. No better mindset.

I have a problem. I am lazy. Not your average lying-in-pajamas-on-a-Sunday type of lazy. No. Not that kind of acceptable lazy. Almost all my days are super unproductive. I literally do nothing all day everyday. By nothing I mean surf all day long, mindlessly, going from YouTube to Twitter, googling random meaningless topics. If there was a job for doing nothing, I'd be the best employee. Funny thing is I actually have a job. A freelance job which is super easy and which I stand to make $60-$120 A DAY. Yes, a day. I just have no interest in working. None. I'd much rather sit and laze about. And it's killing me inside. I hate myself every single day. It's really hard to admit this but I just spend my days eating and sleeping. Like I live to eat not eat to live. The relationship I have with food is destructive. I notice that early in the morning when I haven't taken breakfast, my mind feels super clear, I am productive, up and about, I am kinder and more considerate etc. But the moment I eat something, it's back to square one. I just want to eat more. The difference is like night and day to the extent that I purposely avoid food on days that I have to take a test or work. I still live with my parents which means that I don't have to pay bills which of course means I have an advantage over other people. And I hate being me. I LOATHE being this way. I always feel like such a fraud when I'm hanging out with people because on the outside, my laziness and unproductivity doesn't show. In fact, many people think I'm such a hard worker because of my meek demenaour and relatively good grades. But I'm not. I'm tired of not being able to relate when people talk about being \"so tired from work last night\". I want that for myself. I want to be a busy bee all day, EVERY DAY. Please guys, I need help, like it's not a want at this point, it's a desperate cry for help. I have great goals for myself, all I need to do is execute my plans and I will be successful. My dreams are wonderful, if only I'd wake up. I want money to leave my abusive home and take care of the one good, supportive parent I have who is chronically sick. Times are tough for me, especially with the physical abuse and it's just like, why can't I pull it together? Where's my ambition? I'd like to point out that I have ADHD but I don't necessarily think my absolute lack of motivation to do anything is related to that. No, I'm not depressed. I take care of myself in terms of hygiene. I hate to admit this folks but I really am just lazy. I won't blame this on ADHD coz even though I struggle with focus and procrastinating, this goes beyond that. I've been lazy since I left high school (6 good years damnit) and this needs to stop! Zero accomplishments despite being so old and I am impatient to get my life together. I started going to the gym as a way to structure my day and I felt relatively better but gyms cost money which I don't have, coz I'm lazyyyy. So I couldn't even renew my gym membership guys. I need to change. Like yesterday. I don't want to be the 40 year old bum still staying with her parents. Please help me out. Feel free to be as brutal as you like. All corrections are welcome.

I was feeling quite depressed at this point, because I was behind in school and feeling weak and very much not in control of my life. I began to have obsessive thoughts around my food, mainly stemming from a fear that I\u2019d gain weight since I couldn\u2019t exercise. I watched hundreds of IF and what I eat in a day videos, and would obsess over my body. I started intermittent fasting for practically the entire day and drinking heaps of coffee as a laxative. I also began chewing and spitting junk food, and would eat dinner as early as possible so I could fast for a longer period. I was painfully aware that what I was doing wasn\u2019t good for me, but I just could not rid my mind of hyper aware thoughts around my body and my fear of food (something I\u2019d never previously had). A couple months past and i started playing my sport again, but the habits stuck around for another 4 months, and I performed badly in my sport due to me being underweight and weak. I played at an elite level, and my under-performance lead to more stress and more restriction till the season ended. I never told anybody throughout, but I slowly began to return to my former self, and I\u2019m fine now (I think).

This might go without saying, but, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. Eating disorder rehab is not nearly as fun as it sounds, and, yes, I know it sounds like a damn party. I managed to land myself in this last treatment center after a phase of a bulimia-esque eating disorder and then a brief, but severe flair of my old pal anorexia. Let me tell you, some crazy shit goes down at these places. \n\nThe first time I went to treatment, it felt a bit like I would imagine going to jail would feel. You\u2019re searched, censored, locked in, and stripped. Well, the stripping was a me thing. It was an accident too. The nurse doing my intake assessment showed me behind a curtain and told me to take my clothes off for the examination. Shaking and pale from the nerves, I thought she said something, but I didn\u2019t process it. Uncomfortably, I undressed, slid my clothes and shoes out from the little stall, or rather, circle on the floor encircled by a yellow curtain that was clearly meant to be cheery but just looked gross, so they could be searched, and stepped out for my exam buck-ass nude. The nurse looked confused to see me with one arm over my boobs and the other hand cupped in front of my lady parts. I think I blocked out what happened after that out of sheer embarrassment. She said something nice, and I turned around to see that she had in fact handed me a gown. In my defense, the gown was essentially transparent, so I would\u2019ve been basically naked anyway. Great start. \n\nTreatment is a microcosm of the real world. Except it\u2019s way worse and filled with craziness. I mean crazy in the most endearing way, at least for most people. There was the one girl I went to treatment with who stood over her roomate while she slept and watched her. Or the other one who wrote in her journal that she wanted to kill all of the other people in the building; I was pretty scared of her already, and after finding out she wanted my scalp, I steered clear of her. When we did interact, I was always super nice. I\u2019m always super nice when I think someone wants to kill me, which actually happens a lot because I\u2019m neurotic and paranoid like that. Especially in high school, I went out of my way to be nice to the scary kids because I didn\u2019t want to end up dead, well, junior and senior year I didn\u2019t want to be dead. My high school experience needs its own blog, so I won\u2019t get into it now. \n\nBut in all seriousness, I\u2019ve met some of the best humans in treatment. Not that I would recommend going so that you can make friends, just FYI. I think it has to do with the fact that we share everything with one another and all have this common understanding because our minds are fucked-up in similar ways. There\u2019s something so comforting about meeting someone who is just as fucked-up as you are. Suddenly, this stranger makes your isolated existence not so lonely any more. I was shocked to find out there were people just like me because I was sixteen the first time I went to treatment, and for sixteen years prior, I didn\u2019t think it was possible for anyone else to understand me. I thought I was this one lonely alien-like being. I met my best friend in the whole world when I went to treatment the first time, and, unlike yours truly, she\u2019s killing this recovery thing. She lives in Pennsylvania, and although we don\u2019t talk all that much, we\u2019re incredibly close. When you go through something as terrifying as your first round of treatment with someone, there\u2019s an instant connection and it\u2019s so strong. \n\nIt\u2019s been a journey over the last six years with my eating disorder, but it hasn\u2019t lacked moments of humor. For those of you who are blessed enough not to know anything about treatment, there are these things called flush checks which are the disgusting and dehumanizing moments when a staff member has to look in the toilet before you flush it to make sure you\u2019re not vomiting. One of my friends took a baggie full of soil from a potted plant and dumped it into the toilet before her flush check. She then complained about her stomach hurting and said she didn\u2019t know what was going on. The staff member was terribly confused and concerned. Eventually, he got to the bottom of it and the plants were removed from the facility for the rest of her stay. Plants definitely get the short end of the stick in these places. No one cares about the damn plants. There was a plant in the corner of the caf\u00e9 here, but it\u2019s gone now because one of my friends decided to water it with her boost. Boost is this stuff that is exclusively consumed by eating disorder patients and really old people and is essentially liquid food replacement, definitely not plant food. It actually tastes pretty good, but it kills your stomach. The famous boost bomb is a real phenomenon. \n\nSo, I\u2019m at my third treatment center and really should\u2019ve gotten the hang of recovery by now, but whatever. I\u2019ll get it when I get it or I won\u2019t get it ever, not sure which one yet. This is my last stay in treatment because I\u2019m so ready to go on and have a life.

I\u2019m binging/purging more frequently. When I\u2019m not doing that I\u2019m restricting and carefully weighing out my recipes to make sure they fall below a certain calorie count. I\u2019m trying to make it to the gym, but have been physically unwell. Which is adding more guilt to the equation and honestly most days I just want to die. I\u2019m so depressed and so lonely, but I don\u2019t want help either because I feel like I need to weigh less to even need help. Like 120 pounds isn\u2019t even anything to worry about. It\u2019s totally normal. I have this super intense fear of reaching out for help and being the biggest girl in treatment. Work is an absolute shit show. I can\u2019t do anything and all it does is trigger Ed habits and suicidal thoughts. \n\nI saw my psychiatrist on Friday and she made me schedule an intake appointment at a local treatment center. Which is kind of a relief in the sense that she\u2019s taking the ability to make a decision out of my hands, I either follow her suggestions or end up being committed anyway. But I was so terrified of telling my husband. In the past when I\u2019ve opened up about stuff he\u2019s gotten mad and told me he\u2019s not my therapist. So I\u2019ve been hiding a lot of what I\u2019m going through emotionally. I\u2019m also worried about what\u2019s going to happen to us financially since I can\u2019t work, but thought we could sit down and figure it out. \n\nThe conversation did not go well. I was honest and told him what my psychiatrist said, that I\u2019ve been going through a lot and haven\u2019t been open with him about everything out of fear and shame. And he just doesn\u2019t care? He got really quiet and told me that my psychiatrist and therapist are just trying to push my problems off on to someone else. I tried to explain that they\u2019re trying to get me physically safe and in a better spot mentally to tackle some of the deeper issues. He said that he doesn\u2019t understand why they\u2019re sending me to another hospital, that the first 2 hospitalizations didn\u2019t do anything, why is this one going to be any different? That I can\u2019t be sick because he sees me eating. That I\u2019ve been eating better than I have throughout our entire relationship. I tried explaining that although it may appear like that from the outside, the reality is much darker. He reminded me that we\u2019re going to lose our home. He ended the conversation by saying we needed to stop talking about it otherwise he would get meaner. Which I guess is good that he recognized that but I felt so shitty and vulnerable and I got absolutely no reassurance that things would be okay. That I could be okay. \n\nI feel so belittled. Maybe he\u2019s right. This whole treatment thing is a waste. Nothings worked in the past, so why is this time going to be different? No therapist wants to deal with my issues, and it\u2019s not like I listen half of the time anyway. I\u2019m just such a burden. It\u2019s better off for everyone involved if I just fade away. \n\nLast night wasn\u2019t much better. Yesterday we went over his families house for some bonding time. It was actually really nice, he failed to warn me though that his aunt was going to cook pasta for dinner. I had a panic attack in the bathroom because I wasn\u2019t able to prepare and there\u2019s no way to purge in their house without someone hearing. The bathroom is right off of the kitchen. I wish he would have spoken with me about it beforehand, especially considering the news I just told him. After that we went to a concert. So by the time that finished I was just so emotionally dead and overwhelmed from being around people all day. He said he still wanted to go to the bar and I asked if we could go home instead and explained that I was exhausted. He drove us home but made me feel bad. He said that he had a rough week and needed to unwind and that he suggested going out because he wanted to and that all I\u2019m going to do is go home and sleep. I said if he needed to unwind we could watch a movie or something - why does unwinding need to involve more people and alcohol? I don\u2019t understand. Especially because I\u2019m so afraid of alcohol calories right now I can barely be in a bar without hyperventilating. \n\nI know my eating disorder is making things difficult. I know it\u2019s taken over my life and I\u2019m not as fun as I used to be. But I don\u2019t see a way out. I can\u2019t be open or honest with anyone because I get zero support. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I\u2019m a terrible wife and can\u2019t give the person I love what he wants and needs. I wish I could just snap my fingers and be healthy for him. I\u2019m tempted to cancel this intake appointment. I don\u2019t think anything\u2019s going to make a difference. I\u2019m never going to be okay and it\u2019s time I just learned to accept that.

Additionally, I\u2019m bloated, tired and feeling v unfit right now. \n\nObviously being travelling I don\u2019t have access to therapy etc, but if anyone has coping strategies or advice I\u2019d really appreciate it.  \n\nTL;DR travelling and a stomach bug have been triggering ED behaviours.

I had 1400 before work, worked til 10, then came home with my intentions being a light meal (veggies and fish or something similar) then sleep. Once I started eating I could NOT stop! I even recognized I was binging like 8 times while I was doing it but my thought process was \u201cwelp it\u2019s already happening so might as well eat a bowl of frosting and peanut butter while you\u2019re at it\u201d. I saw another post on this sub talking about getting \u201cfood drunk\u201d during binges and that\u2019s exactly how I felt!! couldn\u2019t think straight except for eating, it was like my brain was loaded with dopamine cause I felt high and I was laughing at everything with my sister. I ate for 2 hours before finally getting full and falling asleep \ud83d\ude44\n\nI know i\u2019m super susceptible to a binge tonight because I\u2019ll be at work for 7 hours with no food, come home with an empty stomach and lots of binge foods available (cake, candy, etc) and also since i\u2019ve binged yesterday I\u2019m way more likely to do it today too (it\u2019s like an addiction lol) \n\nif any of you pros have any ideas on ways i could distract myself between coming home from work and winding down for bed let me know!!! it would be so helpful to come home to some comments, thank you all \u2764\ufe0f\n", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

Like, I've been hospitalized. I'm in therapy multiple times per week. I go to a group therapy session twice a week. I've been dealing with it for five years. Sometimes I'm good and my BMI is normal. Lately it's not and I might have to go back to in-patient. It sucks. I hate it. But one thing that's getting to me today is condescending people who don't have any idea what it's like. \n\nNot once in years have I ever gotten good advice from a random person who stopped to comment on how thin I am. That's happened to me more than once. \"Eat more\" is a big one. Great advice! Ugh. Not once have I ever gotten good advice from someone who wasn't someone I knew in my real life, a medical professional, or someone who's dealt with the same problem. \n\nIn another subreddit, a girl posts pictures of things she cooks and someone responded by calling out her post history, saying her behavior is unhealthy, that she has an eating disorder, and that people shouldn't be encouraging her to continue her unhealthy behavior. It was honestly terrible and stupid advice. It was shaming for no good reason. Should she not be allowed to participate as she chooses, within the guidelines, because someone wanted to stalk her history and call her out publicly?\n\nBut please, person with no history of anorexia, please tell me how I didn't approach the issue the right way. You're right. Being rude, telling the poster she's toxic, and saying you don't care what she does -- that's how to help someone get healthy. Literally all I said was that the original commenter who linked OP's other posts, including a picture of her (and the poster called her emaciated), was wrong and inappropriate. That the OP had the right to post and it might be helpful for her to do so. That cooking is something that helps me. That they don't know her medical history or what's good for her. \n\nI've been cooking since I left the hospital because it's one way for me to keep dealing with food. It helps. I eat more than I would otherwise. I take a lot of pictures of food to send to my friends and boyfriend because it makes me feel good to share it. Who cares if you get validation that way? Are you not allowed to because you have an eating disorder? I don't get it. If she'd been a normal weight, would anyone have had a problem with her behavior, called her out on it, linked her threads, made comments about how she looks?\n\nI hate seeing people bully people with eating disorders -- any EDs -- thinking it's going to help.
