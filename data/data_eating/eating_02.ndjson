{"post_id": "alvx1f", "created_utc": 1548979733, "title": "Annnd just like that, my meal plan for the next week is ruined.", "author": "my-destructive-side", "self_text": "So I posted yesterday about incorporating cheat days to try and slow down my weight loss (at least until I fulfill some family obligations). The list of foods I eat on a day to day basis is pretty limited and while I have a few ideas for things to add, it\u2019s still going to be hard (mentally and physically) to maintain around my current weight. (Honestly, I\u2019m already planning on losing 3-4 more pounds and then somehow forcing myself to gain a couple back right before I need to see my family.) So these cheat days are pretty important.\n\nI ordered Thai this evening\u2014 two entrees, enough food to last me 4-5 days. Which is extra important, because I hardly have any food left in my house right now and I\u2019m not getting groceries until next Thursday (because I have/had everything planned for the next two weeks, and next Thursday is \u201cthe day\u201d I need to buy groceries in order for the following week to go as planned). I \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d do the shopping any earlier than that without fucking up my plans. (Also it is freezing and icy out so fuck going to the store right now.)\n\nSo my food was delivered and I put a little of each order on a plate for myself (keep in mind this is my only food for today other than a serving of Special K). Sat down and when I was about 2/3 done with my plate I noticed what at first looked like a small piece of mushroom. But nope, it was beef. Dug around a bit and found another piece. God knows how many more little pieces there were that I just didn\u2019t notice while I was eating.\n\nI do not eat meat. Haven\u2019t done for 13 years, at least not knowingly/intentionally. I\u2019m against it for ethical reasons, and it also just disgusts me and freaks me out because in my mind it\u2019s \u201cunclean\u201d and just ugh. I don\u2019t feel guilty since it wasn\u2019t my fault, but I do feel...you know how sometimes if you see a bug, you end up feeling itchy and like there are bugs crawling on/around you even though there was only just the one? That\u2019s not exactly how I feel, but it\u2019s the closest way I can think of to describe it. Just an icky paranoid freaking out kind of feeling.\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough that I have this icky feeling from accidentally eating meat, but now I have to dump out what was supposed to be my next several days worth of meals. It\u2019ll be a full week until I get groceries, and until then I\u2019ll be living off what I had planned to eat after I finished all of this food (eggs and rice and almond milk). It should be enough to last until grocery day, but I\u2019m still fucking pissed. I had everything planned out *perfectly* and now it\u2019s all ruined (AND the food wasn\u2019t exactly cheap either so yay for a colossal waste of money on top of everything else).\n\nIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s good actually because I feel so bloated and disgusting from what I did eat that I\u2019d really rather not eat much of anything at all for the next few days to compensate. So my new normal of next to no food is kind of perfect so I can make up for this disaster. Gotta get rid of the bloat. Gotta get rid of the ick. Gotta get rid of at least a couple more pounds of fat even though the whole point of \u201ccheating\u201d in the first place was to not fucking slip down into the 70s. Only 1.5 pounds away. It\u2019s so close, how could I resist?\n\nBut really. Fuck this place for putting beef in my veggie meals \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I'd like to know, what were the reasons for you leaving, or the program \"not working?\" Basically, what about the program made you leave?\n\nFurthermore, those of you who are motivated enough to have (or are) self-recovered after checking yourself out, I'd like to hear from you as well. \n\nI'm now in PHP, and finishing my 1st week after 23 days in the hospital, followed by a week at home. I felt wayyyyy better recovering on my own at home. I'm 28, and currently living at \"home\" with parents/brother (post-college/working to earn apartment $$$ and build career.) Once I reached an agreement with my family about my meal plan and boundaries, I felt way more confident in recovery, and like I had control. However, now back in PHP, I feel unmotivated, trapped, depressed, and like a \"child\" (I'm the only one over age 15, and who's a guy, in the program.) \n\nI want to check out, and do this on my own (with the help of outpatient specialists, like a dietician, therapist, etc.) It just feels so much simpler.

But this tub of crisco just isn't in the mind space for it.\n\nSTORY TIME.\nI am sitting in my living room at almost midnight, ugly sobbing because after looking down at my stomach earlier and seeing new/red stretch marks, I just wanted to kick myself. This is not the 1st, 2nd or 5th time I have had the same thought:(we is really me.. talking to me) \n\"We need to do something about this, we should've been fixing this, why haven't you done anything? Why can't you maintain a diet or an exercise regimen?\"\n\nSTORY FARM ROAD TIME.\nI've had major highs and lows in life. I was doing half marathons with my family, weightloss bets that equalled money, dieting regularly!\nAnd then I met my boyfriend and we were so happy. And when I moved in with him, I was so happy I didn't realize that all that happiness made food more delicious and I gained the happy weight... \nFast forward.\nI was arrested for possession of a man made substance (thc wax)... if you don't know the consequences of that charge in Texas... Google it.\nI became severely depressed and gained all kinds of weight. On a good day I was around 195ish. I'm so close to 300, just thinking about it makes me want to barf and I'm not bulimic, it's just not for me, but trust me I've thought long and hard about it.\n\nFARM ROAD DONE,  back to tonight.\nMy boyfriend wanted to have sex. \nWhilst in the shower by myself I see and feel how weighted my body is, how my skin and fat are pulling and drooping on my stomach and I feel DISGUSTING.\nHe joins the shower. He holds me a little bit and runs his hands down my abdomin to my foofa  (what I call the fat pouch right about my crotch carpet) and I'm instantly thinking nope. No sex tonight. So I tell him, \"I don't feel attractive. I just feel fat.\"\nHe responds \"Yeah you do have a larger stomach.\" And proceeds to grab my foofa, like a large portion of stomach in his hands and jostles it around creating ripples throughout my fatty body.... further deepening my \"I don't feel attractive\" mental state. \n(Mind you! He is NOT a malicious person, I love him very much. I know the comments would say he's mean and you should leave him. Dude he's a twig, he has NO idea what it's like to have fat on his body. Give him a break.)\nWe finish the shower, we're laying in bed. He still wants to have sex so he tries teasing my nipples. But I'm still NOT feeling it and I'm a little perturbed that he hasn't said anything to the affect of \"No baby, you're beautiful.\" So I'm getting a little bothered.\nHe tries a little more to get a reaction from me and I say, \"I feel like a can of crisco.\" \nHe leans away from me, says \"Oh my god.\" Pulls the covers over his face and decides that's where the conversation ends. \nMe mentally:.....I'm sorry? What just happened?\nI then look inside myself and wonder what I would do in the roles reversed... well fucking ay, I would've been pissed too. So pissed that I would've looked myself in the eye and said \"Shut the hell up.

Wonderful to fantasize about, but obviously can't happen yet based on my current behaviors and how I feel about myself.\n\nBut guess WHAT.  It's not black and white.  It's the action/process/journey of gaining your life back.  Some days that means choosing to eat at maintenance, but maybe other days it just means adding creamer to your coffee again.  Maybe still restricting but choosing to incorporate healthier foods to be kinder to your body.  Maybe you had x amount of B/P sessions today and on that day recovery is giving your body rest and telling yourself it's okay.  Just giving yourself at least one kind thought that day is recovery.\n\nRecovery doesn't have to be taking significant positive action every single day.  If you have the desire to get better, just taking one small baby step or one tiny win each day as you go is you recovering.  Even if 99% of your day was filled with bad behaviors.  That 1% or even .1% of effort you give is enough to say \"I took a step towards recovery today.\"  And some days you'll realize you can give 5% or maybe even 15%.  Taking each day as it comes and doing your best, whatever that is on a given day, is enough to be in recovery.    \n\n\nI'll get off my soapbox.

In my high school years I was a bit overweight, but my senior year it got too much for me to handle. I decided in June of 2018 to start a very popular fad diet that surfaced mainstream media around 2016 and only gets more attention everyday.   I was able to lose a significant amount of weight at a seemingly reasonable pace but I started noticing I was very strict with myself. The diet itself is very strict. Once you fall off you gain a lot of weight back and become bloated in your face and stomach and your bowels hate you. I started constantly checking nutrition facts and obsessed over places my friends and family would eat out, knowing I wouldn\u2019t eat there. I started (unhealthily) intermittent fasting, which lead to OMAD (one meal a day). Some people swear it\u2019s healthy, but I was only eating 1/4 of my normal calorie intake by doing this because I was very restrictive on my foods. If I craved a food I labeled \u201cunhealthy\u201d I would chew it up and spit it out, because in my head as long as I didn\u2019t swallow and throw it up, it was okay (this being my most common habit, occurring daily). I started smelling foods if I was hungry and feed off of the scent. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s gotten to a point where I\u2019m completely terrified to go off this dumb fad diet.   A lot of people see benefits from it, but I think it\u2019s given me orthorexia. I would tell my parents and siblings that I think I had early signs of an eating disorder, reiterating my fear of all carbs, sugars, fruits, processed products, etc. My family just said it was me finally being healthy. It\u2019s weird because this same fad diet has only fed into my dads binge eating disorder. So when he told me I was being healthy, I thought, he must really know! He has an ED himself, I trust his wisdom.   I don\u2019t want to be disrespectful to this ED community, as I know it\u2019s hard because I myself am a binge eating recoverer. But I feel that my habits aren\u2019t healthy? If I feel I\u2019ve eaten too many carbs for the day I won\u2019t eat the next day. If my stomach feels weird I won\u2019t eat the next day. If my face looks fuller I won\u2019t eat the next day. All these habits are encouraged in the diet as a natural detox. I feel so ignorant and confused. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being safe with my body or not but I\u2019m too scared to stop. I don\u2019t want weight regain and I\u2019m still trying to lose weight, so I just continue on since the diet has given me results. I\u2019ve read that diets and heavy restricting cause orthorexia and other eating disorders.. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being paranoid or not. I understand its not as extreme as others who suffer from eating disorders but I\u2019m scared it may get to a point where it will be and I\u2019m trying to prevent that from happening as best I can.

(she's quite wealthy.) on the two week mark, i learn the full story with receipts, that she's emotionally abusing him (similar to how my ex did, like calling him annoying and pathetic), guilting him into staying with her by saying \"if you leave me, i'll hurt myself\", etc. he'd contacted her best friend to try and get her the help she needed without telling her parents. I tried explaining to him over and over how this was not ok, there were a LOT of red flags, he didn't deserve to be stuck in a relationship that continually made him unhappy. Another few weeks later of convincing and my physically distancing myself and they broke up. It ended when she accused him of being the reason she has mental health problems when he asked how therapy was going because he hadn't replied to her texts in a day. then turned around and begged him to come back when he said it was over. that she'd do anything to stay with him. but he was firm. I gave him space to heal from that (it's not immediate to get over it, I think the distance helped though) and we started formally dating shortly after. It's been two months now.\n\nHe knows that I feel fat. i've told him plenty a drunk event how disgusting i find my body. i've said it whilst sober too, but less aggressively. He constantly assures me that he thinks I'm \"a snacc\", he loves my gigantic thighs, that he doesn't think about the fat on my belly. i was fully recovered, i eat two meals a day now, feed myself when i'm hungry with snacks, drink alcohol without worrying about the calories, eat fun things because they're tasty.\n\nuntil I was in the library, minding my business, and who shows up and sits a few seats away from me but her. i forgot she was back this semester. She answered a phone saying, \"It's Kate, hello?\" (not her real name)\n\nI had only seen her in photos and she looked terrible in them, to be frank. I was shocked that they even got together in the first place given how terrible she looked in them, in her profile pictures, on her instagram. But in person? For one, she's petite. A solid 5'2\", maybe 3\". And she's tiny. She could not possibly weigh more than 115 lbs. She has a graceful little nose, no fat under her chin, delicate facial features. Someone came up to her and her face lit up, her voice like a doll.\n\nI mentioned running into her to my boyfriend, obviously. i made a passing comment that \"she looks like a little doll, she's way prettier in real life\", to which he was like \"you're exaggerating\" and \"yeah, except she's probably bulimic or something.\" I think he's forgotten me telling him about my ED I was in recovery from. he kissed me on the forehead and told me i was the cutest and needed to shush if i said otherwise.\n\nI looked at pictures from 4 months ago or so, at the beginning of the semester, and it's so obvious i've gained back a bunch of the weight. I had almost no fat underneath my jaw. my cheekbones protruded and I looked cute even without makeup. now, I look like garbage. my belly is back. my pants are tight. i knew i shouldn't be eating two meals a day, i knew i should have been checking calorie counts religiously like i used to. i told myself after christmas I'd go back to fasting and I haven't.\n\nhe won't be like my ex, tell me i'm getting ugly and push me to fix it. he'll just quietly leave, maybe find someone else. i won't blame him--i'm not the girl he fell in love with 15 pounds ago. and is it any wonder i'm physically unable to take a photo of myself without looking chunky?\n\nmy grades dropped and my social life collapsed when i was restricting, but god, i looked amazing. i fit into size small dresses. my eyes looked huge against my oval face. i want to go back to that.\n\nthanks to anyone who reads this, this was cathartic to write.\n\ntl;dr i met my current boyfriend's ex who was a major pain in the beginning part of our relationship, she's tiny, super fucking pretty, i feel like shit because since recovery i've gained back 15 pounds", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

It's been like this for a while. I've had one of the worst binge purge weeks in a long time, I had made it a week before I feel in again. \n\nYesterday i bought beer and drank a total of eight before my therapy session at 3:30pm. I know. I didnt think I would be so fumbly due to me being an alcoholic, but my therapist def knew something was up. I told her I had 1 at 9 am when I woke up, dont know if she bought it. It's only our second session together, before that I hadn't seen a therapist in about 6 months. \n\nI got my paycheck and dumped 85 on weed yesterday, plus the train so it was 90+. The day before I had a big binge, I was planning on going to mcdonalds and getting a bunch from the dollar menu, I went and they were closed because of the polar vortex and ended up at burger king and ultimately ended missing the toilet and getting a good amount on the toilet seat which is a rarity, I consider myself to be a professional bulimic. While picking up weed he asked me to meet him in a mcdonalds. Fuck. \n\nSo I ended up buying 6 dollars of shame which actually is a good amount of food for the dollar menu. So now I have my weed, unfortunately I have my mcdonalds, and it's time to take the 40 minute trainride home. \n\nSo I get home at about 6pm, b/p. Drink drink drink. And oh, btw did i mention i had a date at 8pm? Nice. So I go and am real fumbly again but thank god it was a movie so i think I slid by fine. Hes sweet and pretty cute, but o so skinny. I've been stuck at a 19.5 bmi for weeks. I dont want to be underweight, I just want to be right on the line. But anyways, I say bye and it's about 10:30 PM, guess who has to walk by the grocery store. Guess who buys more booze, and more binge food. Drink drink drink. \n\nTheres some insurance problem with my antidepressants so I couldnt pick them up and need to make a bunch of bs calls, but honestly I havent been taking them anyways. I have a dr appointment on Wednesday, she might take my blood and I feel like it wont have very good results. \n\nOn Monday I have an apt with an advisor at college, he might tell my mom that 2 teachers smelled booze on me last semester, she wont pay for school anymore if he does. I unrelatedly got off probation like 2 weeks ago. \n\nI have 6 beers left, I'm an alcoholic through and through, but I wont be buying anymore after this. I also am going to portion out my weed for the rest of the month, the only reason I dont take meds is because you have to take them with food and usually by the point of me eating something it's far too late in the day and I'm waist deep in booze.

It's especially noticeable when I pull my hair back into a ponytail, even if I try to pat it down to cover those areas of my scalp that shows through. It's not like completely bald patches, it's just really fine translucent hairs and I think that area is thinner to begin with.\n\nThe last time I was significantly underweight, I actually got a short pixie cut because I couldn't deal with how stringy my hair got. I don't really want to do that again.

My binges usually follow the same pattern. Lower brain plants a seed, then cultivates the idea with reinforcing messages over half an hour or so until I crack and say \u2018f-it\u2019. At that point I\u2019m usually on autopilot and don\u2019t remember much else until afterwards when I\u2019m filled with guilt and shame. I\u2019d been reading a few posts here from you beautiful people that last few days. Often I don\u2019t think they could work or apply to me. One was talking about checking in with yourself in the moment and breathing when you get urges. As my control is pretty much absent when I\u2019ve crossed the line I didn\u2019t think that would ever work. But last night was different. I recognised that it was coming and I sat there feeling very uncomfortable and asked myself how I was feeling and told myself to breathe past it. There were two waves of very strong urges, after the first had gone I felt more relaxed, but about 20 mins later I started having all these crazy thoughts justifying a binge like:\n\n1. The wine in the fridge is a trigger (that\u2019s true I hardly drink anything because of it but keep a bottle in case I have guests) so I should drink it and replace it with a bottle to keep in the garage out of the way. \n2. If I\u2019m going to drink wine I should go to the store and gets chips and donuts to go with it. It\u2019s Saturday night and everyone does it - it\u2019s normal behaviour. \n\nIt seems so ridiculous to me now, but in the moment these seemed very well thought out, justified reasons to binge. I was sat on the couch and I passed the red line. I felt a surge of adrenaline and excitement and started to get up to dash to the store. Then I took a deep breath and asked myself \u2018how are you feeling?\u2019 Then I told myself \u2018listen to your body\u2019. I was anxious as hell, recognised this was binge mode and knew I wasn\u2019t hungry. I breathed through it for a few minutes, took a few sips of water and slowly the urges to run to the store dissipated. That\u2019s when I decided to go to bed. \n\nIt\u2019s about 7 hours later now and I\u2019m really glad I didn\u2019t binge. It\u2019s probably the first time ever I\u2019ve managed to stop that far in and I think in some part it was those posts that I didn\u2019t think applied to me that helped. So thank you to those people who post their stories. Every little helps. Now I\u2019ve done it once I know I can do it again. \n\nTL:DR Stopped a binge at the red line by breathing and listening to my body after reading posts I thought wouldn\u2019t help.

I went from 5\u20198\u201d (172cm) 250lbs (113kg) to 135lbs (61kg) in the span of a year and a half. For the past two years I\u2019ve been stuck in a binge &amp; restrict cycle where I neither gained or lost any weight. However recently, I find it difficult to eat. As I approach underweight territory at an alarming rate I\u2019ve begun thinking, \u201cis this what real anorexia is like?\u201d I\u2019m sure most of you know what I mean. I have OSFED, formerly EDNOS, and feel invalidated because I didn\u2019t have a \u201creal disorder.\u201d Neither really anorexic nor healthy, forever stuck in this form of being a healthy weight with unhealthy habits. But these last two weeks I feel like I\u2019m living out one of these stereotypical Reddit posts. Just like this one I\u2019m making now.\n\n\nI always read these kinds of posts, I enjoy learning about people\u2019s lives. But then you see something like \u201cI don\u2019t even think about food now.\u201d And my first reaction was always BULLSHIT. I see now that I was wrong, let me explain. I have eaten twice in the past two weeks and both times I had to force myself to eat. No more of this scarfing down food in a trance nonsense. I begrudgingly ate the food the first week and almost had a panic attack. It wasn\u2019t even TDEE. This weekend I figure I need to eat again, you know, to survive and all that. And I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it until I was so high I could barely navigate stairs. I didn\u2019t count the calories, but it was enough to snap me out of the brain fog you get from heavy restriction. \n\n\nThe brain fog, I actually miss it right now. I\u2019m only 36 hours into a fast after eating that food and the fog hasn\u2019t set in yet. I don\u2019t know what it is, but there\u2019s something comforting about it. It\u2019s kinda like the brain fog is a warm safety net. This sounds so fucked up to explain, it\u2019s similar to weed but it\u2019s not quite weed. You can also smoke weed with brain fog and become extra stupid. Mostly it makes me a dull and numb person. But, now I\u2019m weighed in at 128lbs (58kg), down 6lbs (2.7kg) in two weeks. This is the first time I lost weight in two years and although I know I\u2019m happy I am not excited if that makes any sense. I just saw my weight dip into 129, everything I\u2019ve wanted for so long. And I put the scale back and kept restricting as if nothing happened.\n\n\nThis has already affected is my job. I wouldn\u2019t even be able to get my job in my current physical state. Right now, if they wanted to test to see if I could lift the minimum for the job, I couldn\u2019t. And that\u2019s only 60lbs (27kg). I told my boss some extremely vague story about having an illness that wasn\u2019t going to get better. Thankfully he completely understood, didn\u2019t ask questions, and only gives me work I can handle. But I am starting to fear that soon, even this stuff I won\u2019t be able to do. I do a lot of work that involves climbing up and down stair ladders. In this shape I won\u2019t even be able to do that with nothing, let alone a box that has weight. I\u2019m always feeling dizzy and faint, I feel like I\u2019m the main character in one of those corny anorexia films. Except I don\u2019t have loads of worried people trying to save me. Nobody would suspect me. I have the perfect cover, working overnights. I work overnight, I\u2019m only awake overnight, so I eat overnight. Or at least, that\u2019s what I tell people. The chance I\u2019ll ever see a true recovery are slim and I\u2019ll probably die when I faint and fall off of something at work.

So thought I would share my experience. \n\nMy binges are triggered by stress and when I feel out of control of situation. I have an extremely high stress job, I love my job and thrive on stress but a friend recommended that i try meditation to help me cope better with stress. With no previous experience I looked at differed options online. I ended up settling for the take 10 approach and downloaded the \u2018headspace\u2019 app after watching a ted talk video on it. It does short guided meditations and has some specific to food and eating mindfully. \n\nI started with the \u2018basics\u2019 of 10 sessions. It is literally just 10 minutes of observing your mind, thoughts and emotional state.... I have found it has made a huge difference to the way a think about food and hunger. It definitely hasn\u2019t been a quick fix and I still have binges, but they feel less out of control. I plan to incorporate a short period of mindfulness into my day everyday and hope that this will be the road that leads me out of binge eating hell. \n\nI sometimes sit and do the 10 minutes when I feel the urge to binge, before I allow myself to eat anything... if I still want the food after the 10 minutes I eat it... but more often than not I am able to make the decision not to do it after the medication. \n\nNot a quick fix... but maybe something that can help someone else also struggling with this debilitating disorder. \n\nPs- Headspace is just the platform I chose to use... there are many options out there... but for me a phone app was the most accessible. \n\nThe ted talk I watched https://www.ted.com/talks/andy_puddicombe_all_it_takes_is_10_mindful_minutes/up-next?language=en\n", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

Now I\u2019m just restricting and losing weight, but I\u2019m not obsessing over food and don\u2019t have any super strict rules like when I actually was anorexic. So obviously I\u2019m not anorexic. I\u2019m just on an extreme and unhealthy diet. It\u2019s a suicide mission, but it\u2019s not anorexia.\n\nYes I know I need to maintain my weight right now, and actually I need to gain at least five pounds, not forever but just for my upcoming visit to my parents\u2019 house. I need to be at an \u201cacceptable\u201d weight for when I see them in order to avoid a shitfit. Once that visit is over I can lose the weight again and then some because it will be months before I have to see them again, and with any luck I\u2019ll be dead before the next visit.\n\nSo yes, it\u2019s time to stop restricting and to make a conscious, monumental effort to pack on some weight. Temporarily.\n\nBUT. I am so close to the 70s. So. Close. And I can just about wrap my hand all the way round my upper arm again. I can restrict for another week. Just one more week and both of those goals will be reached. Then I\u2019ll be satisfied, and then I\u2019ll be more willing to put on that temporary weight. I just need to prove to myself that I can get there again first. I just need those two comforts, just for a day. As soon as that day comes, I\u2019ll do what I need to do in order to cover my tracks. Really.\n\nBut actually, if I double down for an additional week after that, I\u2019ll be able to get close to my next weight milestone. I can\u2019t just walk away when I\u2019m that close. So maybe I\u2019ll do that and THEN I\u2019ll put on that temporary weight.\n\nOf course I need to account for that extra weight loss and factor it in to how much I need to gain (temporarily!) for my visit. So maybe like eight pounds? It should really be at least ten if I want to completely avoid suspicion, but I can explain away some weight loss. Stress, migraines, eating more veg and less takeout in order to be \u201chealthier\u201d and vegetables are so filling that I may have accidentally lost just a tiny bit of weight. Unintentionally, really. I swear.\n\nSo I\u2019ll need to gain eight pounds before I go to see them. But that\u2019s so much, probably overkill really. Five pounds. I\u2019ll gain five. That will be enough to fool them, as long as I\u2019m careful to dress strategically.\n\nThe timeframe on my visit has been moved up. I have to go at the beginning or middle of March rather than the end of March/beginning of April. That\u2019s okay. It\u2019s good actually, because the sooner I can get this visit over with, the sooner I\u2019ll be able to lose my cover weight again and then keep on losing until I hit and ultimately surpass my LW. I\u2019ll get down to the 60s this time, imagine that! \n\nI can\u2019t get ahead of myself though. I need to focus on the immediate future. First, I need to get down to the 70s. Then, I need to gain enough to avoid too much suspicion. Five pounds. I can totally gain five pounds in a couple of weeks. It really should be at least eight to guarantee there won\u2019t be any problems, but let\u2019s be realistic. Eight is not going to happen.\n\nFive it is (after I lose another three, of course, so really only two pounds up from where I am now, that\u2019s not so scary). By the time I\u2019m ready to start gaining, I\u2019ll only have two or three weeks before my visit. But that\u2019s totally fine. I can gain five pounds in a couple of weeks, no problem.\n\nAll I need to do is consume a surplus of 1250 calories per day, every day, for two weeks, and then maintenance until I\u2019ve fulfilled my family obligations. I can eat 2500+ per day, every day. Sure I can\u2019t even manage a fraction of that most days, but I can totally do it if I put my mind to it. How hard could it be?\n\nI\u2019ll just add nuts and seeds and oil to everything I eat, and double my portion sizes of the things that I normally eat. Throw in a few snacks.

Since September my weight has been fluctuating quite drastically and so I've been incredibly sad when I've lost weight through restricting/over-exercising only to then binge for weeks on end and put all the weight back on (and more).\n\nAnyway, back in October I (I'm f21 btw) sent her a photo of my newly toned and sculpted body from working as a arborist and she loved it and let me know it quite a bit. We also know we both like the other but there's reasons why we can't be together so it's a real \"it's complicated\" situation for us. Fast-forward to now and I'm no longer the girl in that picture, I'm quite a few kilos heavier (I'm glad we're not allowed to mention numbers because I'm too ashamed to). We got pretty intimate just before Christmas and I had mentioned that I was fat and I needed to lose weight - she replied with, \"Oh my god, no, you're not fat at all, not even close - stop talking shit\". And in a sense she's right, I'm still well and truly in the healthy BMI range.\n\nSo, 4 days ago I was at the gym lifting weights and I had told her that I was there doing so and that I'd moved up to heavier weights. And I was joking around by saying how I shouldn't have had all those burgers and sour worms in the last few months because I'm paying for it all now by working out everyday for 3 hours. She replied by sending me that photo I sent to her in October and said, \"If you run into this toned bitch can you let her know to hit me up pls and thanks\". Now she was definitely joking, like we were messing around, I know she means no genuine harm at all - we are often very sarcastic and have quite the dry sense of humour with each other.\n\nNow I've never cared about what people said about my weight in the past, I was a very overweight teenager - hurtful comments from my dad or family members never bothered me. But I have never had a comment per se from a friend before, let alone someone I'm intimately involved with. It also doesn't help that she's quite slim and small framed. She's like that hot girl on the soccer team (which is actually true in my case, we're on the same soccer team) that everyone drools over and wants to be with - so that doesn't help things for me either because I feel so out of her league and unworthy. So ever since she said that I haven't eaten, it's been just over 4 days and I can't even look at food, can't stand the smell, everything about it - just, nope. Even my most favourite food I can't stand. Cucumbers or Big Macs - I can't stand either, any food is just pure evil to me at the moment. The scary thing for me is that I have NEVER felt this way towards food before - I've always been an emotional eater so this is very very new territory for me. I feel no urges to binge and no craving. I've had issues with other mental health problems in the past but I don't think I've truly hated myself (and my body) until now - this is pure disgust and I just can't understand how something - a sarcastic joke - got to me. Nothing ever gets to me - rarely anyone is able to penetrate the walls of my mind and yet someone has - with something so (in my eyes) minor.\n\nI've still been going to the gym too for about 2 hours - running or cycling or both, no weights. I just live off black coffee and water, I don't even put sweetener in my coffee anymore (because in general I hate coffee - I just use it for caffeine purposes). I don't know what to do - should I talk to her about it? Or should I leave it? But if I do, I don't wanna come off as weak - as someone who can't take a joke.\n\nIdk, I give up :(", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

I know she\u2019s been really stressed with school work and her kids lately as she vents to me often, and I\u2019m more than happy to listen. \n\nThere\u2019s been two instances recently that have concerned me. About a month ago, we were carpooling to our shift at the hospital and she wanted to stop to get some food at the grocery store before we got there. No problem, I didn\u2019t have time to pack a lunch either. I grab a sandwich from the deli. My friend gets a teriyaki bowl, a large salad, two energy drinks, and impulse grabs three chocolate bars at the register. As she grabs the candy, I don\u2019t say anything and try to not react at all, but she turns to me and says \u201cShhh\u201d in a joking manner. \n\nToday between classes we went down to the cafe in our building to grab some lunch. She buys a roll of sushi, an egg and cheese croissant, a brownie, a latte, and a big cake ball. She had also been snacking on a big bag of Hershey kisses in class. \n\nNow, I\u2019m not someone to judge people for their food choices as I definitely don\u2019t eat their healthiest either and mildly struggling with my weight as well, especially during the holidays. But I\u2019m worried about how much she is eating in front of me and other peers simply because I know binging is usually done in secret, therefore I\u2019m worried she\u2019s binging behind closed doors because she\u2019s struggling emotionally. I don\u2019t want to shame her in any way, so how do I express concern as a friend for her wellbeing without doing that? \n\nAlso, I\u2019m still learning and trying my best to be sensitive to her feelings and the problem of binge eating in general. I definitely am not judging her for struggling with it. I certainly understand how food is a huge comfort and can turn into a cyclic addiction. (Especially as we live in a very predominantly Mormon area and people tend to turn to food over drinking, smoking, etc as a vice.) \n\nHow do I show my love and concern for her without making her feel bad? I just want to make sure she\u2019s okay and help her in anyway she needs. \n\nThanks \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\n\nEDIT: This friend has explicitly asked me to hold her accountable for healthy eating and to call her out but this was a few months ago. Then she will do contradictory things like the \u201cSHHH\u201d thing so I\u2019m not sure. Otherwise I would never have even considered discussing her food habits with her.

I couldn\u2019t show her my sadness because that would make her sad, too, which would slow down her recovery. So, I turned to food to cope with my emotions. Unfortunately it turned into something I couldn\u2019t control and I developed it as a defense mechanism against my depression in the following months. I felt terrible all the time, ate so much pastries and sugar and shit. I suffer from body dysmorphia, so when I did use junk food to cope with my emotions, it did not help in coping because I would just cry about how fat I was or call myself a pig. Again, I FELT TERRIBLE and didn\u2019t even enjoy eating anymore. Good food like a chocolate chip cookie meant nothing to me but a fatty hazard or something I can just stuff in my mouth. \nHowever, started seeing a therapist in March last year and therapy has helped a lot in improving my mental health. I\u2019ve learned to handle my depressive breakdowns by being more mindful and realistic, and I\u2019ve consequently been mindful with my eating. I sometimes go on 1 week clean eating streaks and feel good about myself. Sometimes I binge and fall back, but it\u2019s much more easier for me to step up and keep walking the road to recovery now. \nSince 2019 began, I made it a point to avoid added sugar because it was the number one culprit that drove me into a binging episode. Today, though, I ate a chocolate chip cookie and I enjoyed it!!! I enjoyed the luscious taste of the chocolate and the warm sweet cookie. It took my time to decide whether I was gonna eat it or not, but when I decided to, I briefed myself. I told myself: you are gonna enjoy this cookie as a treat. You are gonna pay attention to its flavor and not think of anything else. You are not gonna associate it with anything you\u2019re going through right now. This is not another thing to help you get by. This is simply a cookie.

Was it painful?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm currently in inpatient hospitalization &amp; am receiving TPN right now. When I was first admitted to the hospital, my health situation was pretty dire and they told me since my condition was so severe, I would have to immediately begin receiving some sort of external source of nutrition. They basically gave me two  choices: TPN, or a nasogastric tube. I opted for the TPN because they told me the NG tube would be really uncomfortable since it goes down your nose and throat. I've been hooked up to it for a little over a week, but so far I haven't gained much weight. I've actually even been losing small amounts... like 0.2kg at a time so pretty negligible, but since my doctors' initial weight-restoration goal for me was to gain 3-4 kg  (7 lbs\\~ish) per week, it's not exactly ideal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't been able to eat much orally; I have one Ensure-type meal replacement drink at lunchtime and 1/4 a portion of the hospital-provided food at dinnertime. So most of my daily intake has been coming from the TPN. It's helped a lot with my energy levels, and since the formula includes things like dextrose, saline, electrolytes, and vitamins, I don't feel faint or dizzy anymore. My vitals have improved significantly since being put on it, but I have to be connected to it pretty much 24/7, even when I sleep. They removed the catheter for about 2 hours a few days ago in between switching insertion sites and so I could take a shower, and my blood pressure &amp; blood glucose levels pretty much immediately tanked again and it took hours for me to recover my hearing (I tend to go deaf in one ear and lose normal vision when I get restriction fatigue). My levels did slowly even out again after being reconnected, but it was definitely a bit disconcerting. So for the moment it looks like I am pretty much completely dependent on it to stay medically stable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe catheter was inserted into a vein in my arm so I'm receiving my nutrition peripherally, with them switching veins/arms every 4 days to avoid infection. But since my veins are really thin and weak right now, it gets extremely painful and sore toward the end of the 3rd and 4th days and sometimes it's kind of hard to bear. Easier than eating, but.... I wish it didn't have to hurt so bad :/\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomeone I know who had previously looked into TPN for their wife when she fell ill mentioned the possibility of having a minor procedure done to install a central line in a bigger vein, which apparently is easier and less painful?

Does anyone here have experience with getting their TPN administered through a central line?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry if these questions are all too weirdly specific or hard to answer...

{"post_id": "anmti2", "created_utc": 1549426158, "title": "A tip for binge eating", "author": "AkashaVayu", "self_text": "I thought of something that helps me that might help someone else. I learned that people who binge eat have often experienced a lot of gas lighting, or at least gas lighting at a young age, even if it was seemingly subtle. This creates the feeling of losing your mind and the inability to connect with yourself and people, you can't trust yourself or your feelings so you turn to food to shove them down, wanting to connect to something. We do not have a healthy relationship with food, or maybe healthy connected relationships at all.\n\nThat being said, lets start a practice that helps build a healthy relationship with food and yourself, so you can begin to feel this again. We often don't feel satisfied eating proportionate amounts, we impulsively and quickly shovel down food, feeling guilt and betrayal afterwords, our body feeling terrible.\n\nWhat foods feel good to eat? Not to emotionally stress eat, but what feels good to your body? If you dont know, start paying attention to how different foods make you feel, this will enhance the practice. To prepare the food yourself and think about how beautiful your food is helps too.\n\n1. Before you start eating, (if it is impulsive remind yourself of how this will make you feel better) create a relaxing environment. The mood we are in while we eat plays a vital role in digestion. Make some tea, put on some music, burn a candle or inscence, make the lighting comfortable.\n\n2. Make sure you are relaxed before you grab some food, and before you eat once you have your food. Grab a plate and put a proportionate amount of food on it, smile and sing love into your food. Do some breathing exercises, my favorite is to cover one nostril at a time and breathe through the nose, switching back and forth. This balances the emotional energy and stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system. \n\n3. Now, if you want to try this, use your hands to charge your food with love, generating loving energy. If you do not want to do this, at least thank your food before you eat it. When you Thank your food, think about how it was made, grown, raised, the nutrition it holds, the energy it has, what it experienced, how it ended up in front of you, and how it will nourish and help your body. This will help you grow more appreciative of your food and yourself, and it will taste better too. \n\n4. While you are eating, eat slowly, and chew your food well. Enjoy every bite. When you do this, it gives your body more time to process your food, and it is much easier to digest. It will help you feel more satisfied when you are done. It helps to drink tea while you eat, too. \n\n5. After you are done, thank your body for everything it does and rub your tummy, say I love you. Drink some water, allowing it to purify you body, which you can charge with love, too. \n\nI hope this helps :)", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I\u2019m currently in a serious relapse with my ED and my weight is way down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently I was (am) fairly suicidal. I only told one person.

I\u2019m still fucking demolished over it, not to mention the three other friends who have gone that way. I do NOT need to be told about the affects of suicide on friends and family. I\u2019ve experienced more loss via suicide than all three of them together. So don\u2019t fucking give me the guilt trip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey literally had no clue what they were doing.

If it doesn't belong, I'm sorry.\n\nI have a really bad irrational fear of food. Specifically that it is contaminated in some way that will make me very sick. \n\nFor some back story, this didn't just pop up out of nowhere. I won't get super detailed, but since its relevant, I'll just share the basics. My mom had Munchausen by proxy. When I was a kid, she would put things in my food to make me sick(also would feed me spoiled food when I was too little to tell it had gone bad). She would also give me \"medicine\" sometimes. I still have no clue what the medicine was, but it was awful beyond words and always made me violently sick. I figured out what she was doing when I was around 10 and it slowly spiraled out of control from there. The more difficult I was about eating what she gave me, the more creative she got with what foods she messed with. \n\nI never grew out of this fear. I'm 22 now and haven't had contact with her since I left home, I'm not even in the same city anymore. But I cannot shake this fear that anything I eat will make me sick. I'm the same way about medicine, but it isn't as bad. \n\nI've seen doctors about this, but they typically just diagnose me with anorexia and give me literature about it and suggest I go to see someone that specializes in that. I can't afford to do that now, but my mom did take advantage of my eating problems when I was a teen(She couldn't make me sick anymore, but having a kid with an eating disorder apparently got her the same kind of attention as a chronically sick kid did). At one point she did have me see someone about my \"anorexia\". Nothing they talked about fit how I felt about food or helped me really. I don't feel like I need to lose weight, I'm not afraid of gaining weight(I would love to actually), I do feel hungry and want to eat. In fact I know I'm starving and I want nothing more than to eat and feel full for once, but the second I sit down in front of a plate of food its like I have a thousand voices in my head screaming at me that it will make me really really sick if I eat anything on the plate. Even if I do manage to make myself eat, half the time I end up throwing up later because the anxiety only gets worse after I've actually made myself eat it.\n\nI've been dealing with this for a little over a decade now and it has destroyed my health. I'm 5'11\" and I only weigh 98lbs(I'm a guy). I'm at risk for heart and kidney failure now according to the doctor I just saw earlier this week, I have osteopenia and anemia. I can't even go up a flight of stairs without needing a break halfway up because I don't have the energy to make it in one go. But every time I have talked to an ER doctor or a regular doctor, they always look back in my file and see that anorexia in my history and think I'm just making up excuses. Maybe that's what it is, I don't know. But, everything I read about it or anytime I saw someone about it as a teen nothing clicked with me. They would tell me how they thought I felt about food and it just wasn't right, but nothing I said ever convinced them otherwise because my mom made sure to cover herself so no one would believe me when I told them about the things she would do.\n\n I can save up some money to go to a therapist, but it has to be the right kind. I'm already drowning in medical debt, I can't afford to go to a therapist who won't listen to me or will just give me advice that I already know doesn't help me.\n\nDoes anyone here know if this is a kind of eating disorder? Or is it really some type of anorexia? I can't be the only person in the world who has had this. I just want to be healthy for once in my life and maybe just knowing what to call this will finally put me in the right direction to find someone that can help me.

I am a lifelong binge eater, starting when I was pre-teen to cope with abuse.  It started as a means for me to take back control, albeit in a self-destructive way.  I have IBS, though, so even though I have been a compulsive binge eater almost my entire life, I have never gained a significant amount of weight which has made me somewhat complacent about recognizing that I have a problem.  But I do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn early January, my relationship - which I thought was going well - fell apart.  I don't really know why.  Things were great one week, the next it was over.  Nothing really happened (other than my now ex has a lot of mental health issues, the severity of which I was just starting to realize) so I think it was a more a problem on his end rather than mine.  It's still my problem, though, because I have a lifetime of failed relationships and always seem to pick the same kind of narcissistic, histrionic, misogynistic assholes.  Again, probably my upbringing has a lot to do with it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't emotionally feel anything over the breakup at the time (which was bizarre) but I realized last night I've engaged in almost a solid month of out of control binge-eating.  I also realized last night that, yeah, I really do have a big problem.  Psychologically, I realized I am deliberately trying to gain a huge amount of weight so I will stop being attractive to anyone.  It's a stupid mindset, I know, but because of my early abuse I have been conditioned to see the only value I have as a human being is my sexual currency.  Deep down, I feel I have no value to anyone outside of that.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo be completely honest, I DON'T want a relationship again.  I'm in my early fifties, I look like I'm in my forties, if I lost twenty pounds I'd look like I'm in my late thirties.  I think it's safest for me to just focus on building a healthy relationship with myself and keep away from men altogether.  (Obviously, I don't choose them wisely!)  So I'm binge-eating to make it easier to avoid them.  I want to stop because it isn't healthy but it's like I'm being controlled by a puppet from my childhood and I can't cut the strings.  \n\nHow do I cut the strings?!

Then we divide those up by six and eat those amounts of protein and carbs per meal. I'll have eggs with crackers and a grilled veggie for breakfast 1, oatmeal with blueberries and a muscle milk for breakfast 2, protein pancakes with a banana for breakfast 3, chickpea spaghetti with shrimp for lunch 1, quinoa with tofu and stir fried veggies for lunch 2, and usually gardein chickenless tenders with sauerkraut for dinner.

First time poster here, so excuse me if I don't format correctly or make mistakes. \n\nI was recently thinking about my own past with eating disorders. I was anorexic from 13-16 and it has come creeping in and out of my life (I'm almost 22) ever since, including a small bout of bulimia about two years ago. \n\nI realized that, although I don't particularly starve myself or overly restrict calories, I still find myself refusing food, ignoring hunger pains, and frankly feeling guilty almost every single time I eat. But, I still eat fairly normally because I don't ever want to deal with the brain fog I had while anorexic ever again. Because I have normal-ish eating habits and generally have (off and on) for awhile, I consider (maybe considered) myself recovered. \n\nSo I guess what I'm asking is, am I actually recovered, or have I been fooling myself this whole time? It has honestly become so normal to associate eating with intense shame that I hardly think of it as abnormal or harmful. Is this normal? Have I just been ignoring my own issues this whole time?

Mostly women here who understand or can offer perspective and we also have some men who are not only lurking here to defend themselves but could maybe offer insight without feeling offended. The guys on this sub are generally very reasonable. \n\nPlease restrain from making this a war of the sexes thread. \n\nSo here goes. Yesterday I was binging Modern Family and there's this episode where Alex' college professor (whom she has a massive crush on) falls for Hailey after he sees her *one time*. This guy is a genius, a very interesting bloke, in terms of looks not very remarkable though. And he just immediately falls for Hailey, the 10, while completely overlooking Alex who, while cute, is a bit pudgy and will never hold a candle to Hailey's perceived hotness.\n\nAnd the thing is, this guy starts dating Hailey, finds out that they have *absolutely nothing* in common but *still* tries to make it work instead of ever looking over his shoulder at the, granted, less hot girl, but who is *infinitely* more compatible with him, who is nice, smart and funny and just an overall great girl.\n\nAnd this just kind of hit the nail on its head for me. I've seen this *sooooo many times* it's not even funny. I've had conversations with guys before, conversations where we totally clicked, had a connection, a great deal in common and it just felt right. But the *second* a girl in the range of 8-10 walks in, it seems like they just totally forget you exist, their eyes are only on her and it's like your conversation and your chemistry didn't even happen. And this goes for all kinds of men, not just the totally hot ones, quite the contrary, I notice it much more among the cute guys, kind of plain looking maybe, a bit nerdy but totally friendly and nice. You know, just your 'average' guys. \n\nIt's just sooo frustrating and kind of triggering. But I mean, I know how I look and I will simply *never* be a 10. I can get as skinny as I want but just my looks in general make me about a 6 perhaps, a 7 at most if I put in a lot of effort. And you know, I'm fine with that and I don't resent hot girls at all. It just makes me kind of sad that I'll probably always be someone's second choice at best.\n\nI mean why is this? Why do they get such tunnel vision on the hot girl and even when they don't have anything in common at all, even if the girl has an awful personality, that they *still* try everything in their might to make it work? Just because she's hot? Is that it? I mean there has to be more to it right? ", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I bitch about a lot in here. I also briefly mention numbers and rant about the way I was sold \"recovery\". I'm a mess, lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went through treatment for my eating disorder back in my teen years, over a decade ago. Life got really, really hard and I went back to it about a year ago. I'm older with a family (husband and child). As soon as I recognized what was going on, I confessed to my therapist (was seeing a T for anxiety). I've been struggling to go back into \"remission\" (side rant but the term recovery just pisses me off at this point). I was doing a lot of purging w/o bingeing until about September. Things came to a peak then and I started to restrict. Since then I have lost about 15% of my weight. My BMI was a 22 to start and now it's hovering around 19, so I am still a \"healthy\" weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of that said, I have a lot of responsibilities. I am a mom, a student, I have a job, I'm a coach, and my husband and I are getting work done on the house in addition to every day things like chores/cooking/homework help/etc. I have been balancing on the line of \"healthy\" for months. My intake is way too low for my activity levels (I am a distance runner/biker) but not so low that I'm dropping weight super quickly or unable to function. In the last month or so I've started to get some of the physical symptoms (hair looks terrible, skin looks terrible, SO FRICKEN COLD HOLY CRAP, my poor digestive system) and I know if I keep losing, I am heading into dangerous territory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's my problem: trying to eat makes me feel like absolute garbage. I know that is par for the course because my body is a mess right now and needs to heal. But I can't just sleep 18 hour days and spend the rest of the time in the bathroom. So I keep yo-yoing back into restriction so I can \"feel better\". Last time I went into remission, I was able to sleep the way my body wanted me to, eat the way my body needed me to, and do a whole lot of nothing for a few weeks. Now, the exhaustion is causing my anxiety to be really high almost constantly and it impacts my ability to do the things I have to do. So I keep putting off \"true\" recovery until X time. \"When I'm on break from school\" \"when we're on vacation and my husband can help me more\" etc. But of course, we all know that's crap because that's the ED running the show and she will never let me recover.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm also kind of panicking because I am still technically a \"healthy\" weight, albeit the low end of that range, and I think I have to restore a little weight. My therapist briefly touched on it but I see my doctor on Tuesday and he wanted me to talk to her about it. I am already struggling with \"maintenance\" calories (I fired my dietician so I don't have anyone for that at the moment) and the thought of eating more to gain just scares me. I also know that losing just a few more pounds puts me in a seriously problematic place because I'm an amateur athlete and my BMI doesn't mean much because my muscle composition and those muscles will start to break down (if they haven't already, my workouts have been a struggle for about two weeks now).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess I just felt the need to get some of this out of my head. I am smack dab in the middle of wanting remission and wanting to be sick. It sucks. Most of the time being sick wins out of convenience. I know I will have to throw myself mind/body/soul into it to get back in remission and I don't feel totally prepared for that. Anyone else gone through a big relapse years after the first round of treatment? I just see stories everywhere of people with these amazing successes in remission and it bums me the F out. I feel like some sort of colossal failure because I was sold on \"recovery\" being a golden ticket to a beautiful life and that \"lifelong recovery\" is not only a thing, it's a thing for everyone if you want it bad enough. It just makes me feel shitty. It makes me feel like a terrible mom and wife. Hell, it makes me feel like a terrible person in general.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I was floored cause while I definitely restrict a lot and am terrified of weight gain, I\u2019m technically a healthy BMI, but she said she thinks I\u2019m maintaining a low weight relative to my natural body weight based on 1) the amount of weight I\u2019ve lost in a short period of time (which is admittedly a lot) and 2) my physical symptoms (get my period very rarely, am always freezing cold, fingernails are kinda blue, often dizzy).\n\nI don\u2019t know what to think. One the one hand, she is the professional here, but on the other hand my ED voice is now really strong in telling me I\u2019m \u2018cheating\u2019 somehow to get diagnosed with anorexia without being at an underweight BMI.\n\nI\u2019m just feeling a little lost and confused and was hoping for some perspective/support from others", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

Maybe when I got a (non-hormonal) IUD two Tuesdays ago? Maybe the day before? All I know is I didn't eat Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, and I attributed it to feeling weird and crampy from the IUD. On Friday my psych doctor thought it would be good to start me on four new media at once, and I ate a salad with that because two of them should be taken with food, and then I spent all of Friday nauseous and almost of Saturday throwing up. I took the mess that one time that Friday but haven't taken them since, because I'm too scared they'll make me sick and because I don't want to eat. \n\nThat Sunday I felt physically great. No nausea, no cramping, nothing. And that's when I realized my appetite was just... gone. There was no desire to eat, and I couldn't attribute it to any sock feelings. And I thought back and realized my previous days of no appetite were sort of the same, not really because of the cramping or anything (except the throwing up, that definitely killed it.)\n\nAnd so I've spent the last week just... not eating. A couple potato oles a friend offered me, licking sugar scrub off my lips, drinking broth, I'm taking in small amounts of calories, but I'm not eating. But I feel fine! I'm not tired, I'm not cold, I'm not weak, I'm great.\n\nI've gone from 153lb to 138. This is the lowest I've ever weighed as an adult and I'm on a cloud. Next Friday I have to see my psych doc again, so my weight loss will be discovered, but a huge part of me is pushing to see if I can keep not eating til then. \n\nThe other part of my recognizes that my appetite just disappearing is probably not food. But I don't have a fever, I don't feeling bad, I'm HIV-, I don't know what it would be. So I should probably try to eat, and if I can't I should tell my doctor right away.\n\nBut this feels like a miracle. I've been wishing for this for so long. I wish on shooting stars and eyelashes and white  horses for this. I watched a short horror film about a family where one by one each member just stops eating for unexplained reasons despite feeling great, and I just dream about that being me. And now it is. And I don't want to throw it away. My weight is just flying off. My TDEE is in the 2000s (I haven't been recalculate as I've been getting smaller but I'd guess around 2100) so it's not even like it's all water weight. I might be able to break into the 120s if I keep going til Friday, and I would lose my mind if that happened I'd be so excited. \n\nRational brain says something might be wrong.

Since then, I've been working with an outpatient team. Since I was, and still am, a teen, they enforced family-based treatment. It was essentially a living nightmare for me, as my ED  developed partially in relation to my mother's obsession with control (she exhibited narcissistic tendencies and as a result, was emotional abusive)  Feeling entirely dependent on my father and my step-mother, while emotionally distressing,  I will say that at the time, I was probably too entrenched by my disorder to properly nourish myself, so it was entirely suitable for the period from which I intitally returned from hospital. Following that initial period however, and my brain fog dissipated, this treatment became difficult, as my parents were frustrated by it's rigidity and I, nearly, eighteen, hated that it made me attached to their hip. I began to eat independently, but because I hadn't reached their goal weight, they enforced a meal plan. Things were doing sort of okay for a while,  my weight had settled slightly under their goal ( in a healthy bmi range though! Was feeling p proud at the time (: ). Now, after my anxiety affected my eating habits negatively over the holidays, which caused me to lose weight to the extent that they got threatening ( it wasn't sudden or massive drop either, simply a slip, I'm back to maintaining thank goodness),  and told me if I didn't comply to the meal plan and gain by next appointment, they'd make my parents feed me again. They told me because I'm not 'complaint' to treatment, if I wasn't 17, they'd refer me to PHP for adults.  I feel like such a terrible person for not achieving their goals they set for me, but also feel like I have no agency in this process.  We, as a family, have had some difficulties navigating the treatment, as although it's been vocalized by my parents that for my personal case, I most definitely possess co-morbid conditions that need treatment before I can fully recover, they've provided little resources for that, and instead, focus entirely on weight gain and being meal plan compliant. Personal therapy for these are unfortunately not an option for me, as it'd cost too much, and my outpatient program that I currently attend, is free.  Basically what I'm getting at is, do you think it's entirely bad that I'm considering to be discharged? I want to recover, but feel that sometimes the focus on numbers, and meal plans almost triggers my obsessive/compulsive behaviors toward food/body image. I worry though that by discharging though, I may be setting myself up to failure. :( if i didn't include enough context, I am more then willing to answer more questions..\n\nP.s one suggestion my stepmom made was possibly trying to normalize my eating in the sense that I try to eat consistently (but not obsess like a meal plan) and  just make an honest effort to incorporate fear foods into my diet so that they become staples again...\n\nPPS I am not resistant to the demand to gain weight.

My weight plummeted to extremely unhealthy levels.\n\nThen, from December onwards, things changed, the hunger kicked in and I gained basically all the weight back through massive binges.\n\nAt first I told myself that I needed to gain weight anyways, so it wasn't that big of a deal. But right now it's been a couple of weeks since I've entered the healthy BMI range and I still keep on binging. My binges keep on being absurdly massive - we're talking three days worth of food in less than two hours. Then I freak out and panic completely restrict heavily the following day, then end up overly hungry and binge again. I don't have any specific hour or trigger when binge happen; sometimes I wake up overly hungry in the morning and binge right after having left the bed, sometimes it's in the middle of the afternoon, sometimes (very rarely) it's late in the evening like today.\n\nI had eaten X calories (with X being around half of what I'd need, but basically around double of what my Anorexia feels comfortable with) and I felt great. But then, after dinner, I felt the sudden urge to just go out and get food. And I did it. I binged again, eating other X calories three times. I am now sitting on my chair with a slight discomfort on my belly and a very, very, very powerful feeling of being horrible, fat, gross, horrible, fat, gross. My belly is huge, my legs are huge, I am all huge. I am completely, utterly, incontrollably TERRIFIED. I just want to cry, scream, run away. The only thing I can think of right now is: you will never ever stop, it's never going to get better, you will eat and eat and eat until you will be obese and more than obese and then you will eat yourself to death.\n\nWhat saddens me the most is that before my ED I was already an adult and I was skinny. I effortlessly managed to maintain a BMI which is only slightly higher than where I am now. Yet I can't seem to be able to do it anymore. I don't know what's broken in me. I feel hopeless.\n\nI don't have any support. I am abroad, meaning that I can't talk with my old therapist back home. I also can't find a new one here because I can't afford it and in less than a month I will move to another city so it wouldn't make sense anyways. I have a meal plan my dietitian wrote some time ago but that was when I was underweight, so it's not applicable at my situation now as I don't have and don't want to gain any more weight.\n\nI don't know if someone has ever experienced this. I feel so bad, like really bad. Really, truly, terribly bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

Reading more from there, and later r/EDAnonymous and r/EDanonymemes that are really the pro eating disorder subs remade to avoid the ban, made it very clear to me that fasting is not an eating disorder and that the psychology is completely different. However the suffering and behaviors described therein was very concerning and the fact that they project their own troubled relationship with food onto others so that it seems more \u201cnormal\u201d and like lots of people are doing it was really worrying. It seems like a lot of people with EDs project and use that to tell themselves they aren\u2019t really that disordered. I looked at the top posts on the r/EDanonymemes sub and multiple ones referenced this subreddit. I get that if you have an eating disorder it must be hard to see people talking about being able to not eat for a while and then eat normally without obsessing over or fearing food or whatnot, but it seems very worrying that people would use this as an excuse not to face their problems. Is there any way to help them recognize the difference and remove that excuse not to see how dangerous and serious of a medical problem EDs are?\n\nBasically:\n\n1. How can awareness be raised among ED sufferers that fasting isn\u2019t the same as disordered eating, that they are very sick and need help, and that what they are experiencing is NOT a normal diet/behavior that healthy people do and requires medical treatment?\n\n2. How can awareness be raised among non ED sufferers that fasting is not an eating disorder and that eating disorders have a significant psychological component that is completely different?

When you eat low cal foods to prevent from eating high cal foods, your brain enters a mode where it feels like it's ok to keep eating. This is almost like you allowing your brain to learn that it's ok to eat as much as you want, which perpetuates the BED cycle. What you really want to do is to retrain your brain into understanding when to stop eating, not teaching it that it's ok to eat unlimited stuff.\n\n2. **Remind yourself that the future exists!!** When I binge, I get into a haze where I only care about the temporary feeling; it's almost as if the future doesn't exist anymore. Then when I finish binging, I realize what I've done and I remember he consequences. Have some kind of method of remembering future consequences &amp; goals. Maybe alarm reminders or sticky notes on binge foods? It also helps to make a list of future consequences &amp; goals, to be aware and snap out of it.\n\n3. **You will NEVER be satisfied if you eat the binge food!** Honestly. If anything, you may even want it more afterwards, then you create a terrible way to deal with it such as fasting and you binge again... You get the cycle. Do you really wanna deal with the consequences afterwards? The fight against binging is only a temporary discomfort. Power through. Teach your brain it's not worth eating binge foods.\n\n4. **If you absolutely have to eat and have no more power to fight, choose the right things!** If you feel like eating high volume, eat a bunch of fruits and veggies. It will decrease the guilt afterwards. If you are super hungry bc you haven't eaten in a while and/or want to eat just for satiety, not fullness, eat something with high magnesium content: fish, dark chocolate, lentils, raw sunflower seeds... Etc.\n\nThese are the most important aspects that are working for me. I have some more that help, but these are the most crucial ones. I have been dealing with BED for almost 10 years and I think I have finally/mostly recovered. If I of all people can do it, you can too! I keep reading that the longer you have a bad habit, the harder it is to break. But I don't believe that. I believe that the longer you have a bad habit, you just know more ways that don't work for you. It's still progress. Keep going. You will do it.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I've gone over and over things concerning food and eating to the point where I used my own ability to think to create the obsession with food purely because I decided to constantly think about it a million different ways there by keeping it firmly locked in my mind. You'll probably become obsessed with anything you do a million times. I've turned food into something it never was at the beginning. Before dieting food never crossed my mind until it was time to eat. Anyone remember those days? Yeah I would emotionally eat on the occasion but before dieting it was just as effective as taking a walk or calling a friend. I never felt shame or guilt afterwards. I felt good. The shame &amp; guilt only came in after dieting because I knew eating more = diet ruined. There was no wrong before trying to lose weight.

Plus ignore any grammar/spelling mistakes, I\u2019m on mobile.\nJust for some context, last year I asked the person who I like out and eventually I asked them to be my s/o, to which they agreed. It was great to have someone who had similar interests as you along with someone to talk to about more serious topics. We would basically go to each other with our problems or with anything that happened with our lives. Now granted I struggle with anxiety, depression, and am eating disorder while my s/o struggles with similar issues. But as time went on, I started to get worse. I tried to open up about me falling down the rabbit hole of sh and relapsing in my eating disorder again with the addition of accidentally dragging my s/o down with me. My s/o tried to offer their best advice for my problems, but there\u2019s only so much they could do. Plus with all my problems, I am almost certain added to their issues they have. I realize that I need a good amount of help but the issue of me being a minor, not having insurance or the money to pay for what I need goes into account. So today my s/o asked to take some space apart, since currently it isn\u2019t good for any of us. They still care for me, but currently it didn\u2019t seem like our relationship was going very good. I was at first taken slightly by surprise since I thought everything was good, but then I realized I was quite oblivious to what my s/o is going through. I really care for them, but I\u2019m thinking some time apart until our issues get sorted out would probably be the best thing. \nSo my question is was this the best choice? \nAnd my next thing is what should I do regarding my mental issues?", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Restrictively dieted down to underweight, lost my period, and was completely fixated on food to point where many nights I couldn't sleep because I was thinking about food all night. Many days I fasted all day or just had one meal. If I ever ate anything caloric like a burrito, I would run for 3 hours and extend the fast.\n\nSoon after I hit my lowest weight, I started binge eating. I would over exercise or fast to compensate. I no longer restrictively diet and the binges and food obsessions have let up dramatically. I'm now no longer underweight.\n\nAs per trying to eat healthier, I make it a point to eat 3 meals a day. One problem is my boyfriend fasts all day and has one big meal at night. He seems to judge me for wanting food throughout the day, i.e. eating breakfast and lunch. If we're ever out and about doing things and I want to get lunch, he gets annoyed. And if I'm lucky enough for him to agree to eat out, he'll just watch me eat and I feel weird. \n\nI know I have no right to dictate his eating habits but honestly it's been bothering me.

It really felt like she would just be looking at me, and no matter what was happening, all she could see was a human container for fat.\u00a0 \n\nFor a really, really long time, almost every time she called me, like a broken record she would tell me to get an office job (I\u2019m a freelancer), exercise more, and think about my future marriage to my hypothetical husband.

I\u2019m desperate for advice...\n\nMy girlfriend of a little under a year is going through a really tough time right now and I\u2019m not sure what to do.\n\nHer therapist, her doctor, and a few of her friends and family have all shown concern about her eating habits. We have all made attempts to talk to her about it but she shuts down and gets extremely defensive and denies the possibility of an eating disorder. For a while, I have just been by her side comforting her and being as supportive as humanly possible.\n\nThe past few weeks she\u2019s gone to her therapist and come home extremely upset. I would ask her if it was something she wanted to talk about or something she just wanted to just be left alone. When she would talk to me about it, it was always because her therapist would begin asking her about her eating and talk to her about developing a good relationship with food, etc. she would always follow up with something along the lines of, \u201cthis is ridiculous! I don\u2019t have an eating disorder! I can eat a lot of food when I want to! She just sounds exactly like my grandparents.\u201d\n\nShe will eat one or maybe two \u201cmeals\u201d a day. These meals are usually a cup of yogurt with granola or some rice with cheese, tomatoes, and black beans.... which is one of the best meals she eats. \n\nShe is very skinny. Unhealthily skinny. She still has a rather regular mensural cycle which I see as a good sign, but recently her kidneys and digestive tract have been giving her trouble along with extreme fatigue and regular depression.\n\nI have been standing by as the supportive boyfriend, but now she is threatening to stop seeing her therapist and psychiatrist because they are \u201ctrying to tell her she has something she doesn\u2019t.\u201d She\u2019s underweight and still dropping weight. I really really want to know if there\u2019s a good way to help her come around and open up to the possibility of her having an eating disorder so she can actually start getting better.\n\nShe has always been concerned about her weight and always talks about how she wants to gain weight because she knows she\u2019s not healthy. She will do good for a few days, then go a few days eating one meal or not eating at all because she says she just forgot or it wasn\u2019t convenient. She gets down on herself, then she won\u2019t eat because she says she\u2019s so down that she\u2019s not hungry.\n\nI\u2019m just really worried and at my wits end. Any advice is welcome.\n\nTo be clear, I am very careful NEVER to tell her to eat, tell her she should eat, tell her she is too skinny, or anything of the sort. I am sure to always tell her she will get to where she wants to be, she can do it, tell her she\u2019s doing great when she has good days and reassure her that she is strong enough to get through the bad days.\n\nWhen I make food for myself, I always make enough for her and offer it to her in a non suggestive way and never get on her when she turns it down.\n\nTL;DR\n\nGirlfriends therapist, doctor, and some family/friends have all shown concern about her eating habits but she is in complete denial. She is now beginning to suffer extreme health consequences because of her eating habits and still won\u2019t come around to the thought of an eating disorder. She eats  very little. She is underweight. Diagnosed depression/anxiety, ADHD. Is threatening to leave her therapist because she is showing concern for her eating. Need advice.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

She winced with every sip. I always laughed at that. I had my first drink with her. One day, on our way to school we met at the bottom of some stairs. We bought cocktails and we climbed somewhere nobody would walk through. We drank and then we took the bus. She reached for my hand and we just sat there in silence, I looked out the window and I was sweating. Our fingers interlocked.\n\n\nI waved her off at the gardens. She said to be safe.

I never imagined that it would be possible for me to stop binging for any length of time, let alone this long. Here's some background: I remember binging at age 10, it's possible I started earlier. I binged anywhere from every 3 days to daily once I started, and I'm 33 now. Binging was a coping mechanism for me, I struggle with mental illness and I have always used binging to cope with depression/anxiety and also to celebrate any thing--the weekend, a special occasion, good news, etc. So I would basically binge when I felt good or bad. I also would binge when I ate certain foods, like ice cream, cereal, chips, candy etc. I would promise myself that I would have one serving but once I had that first bite I couldn't stop going back for more until I was beyond sick.\n\nI tried a lot of things over the years to control my binging. Different diets, intermittent fasting, I read the Intuitive Eating book and tried to implement it, I've been in therapy, I've taken lots of medications to try to control my mental illness. I've done diets, I've decided to love my body no matter the size and not restrict at all for long periods of time. But I never could go more than a couple days without binging. I honestly thought it would always be a part of my life.\n\nI decided to try bright line eating last summer, mostly because I wanted to see if removing sugar and flour from my diet would help my mental illness. I didn't think it would help my binge eating because I had given up on anything helping that. BLE in a nutshell is no added sugar/sweeteners, no flour, no snacking, and you eat 3 high volume, measured meals each day. I committed to sticking with it for 4 weeks and planned a binge for the end. But to my surprise I certainly I got over the initial hump, which lasted about 2 weeks for me, I really started cruising along on this eating plan and for the first time in my life I wasn't binging anymore. I started on August 23 and have just stuck to it very easily since then, including over the holidays. Before starting I imagined I'd be white knuckling it through each day but I'm not at all. This is a huge shift!\n\nI have learned a lot about myself in this time, I'm able to see my BED more clearly now that I have some distance from it. I feel like I've relearned how to eat now. I no longer think about food all day long, I plan my meals the night before and only think about food during mealtimes, which has given me a lot of peace in my mind. I can now navigate the worst day without needing to binge. I rarely get cravings but now I know when I do I can sit with it and it will pass. Overall I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders now that I'm in control of my eating and not fighting myself day in and day out. \n\nNot eating sugar or flour was very important for me personally to get my binging under control because of my particular triggers--I was using food as a drug and looking for that dopamine hit. Cutting out foods probably wouldn't work for someone who is triggered by restriction so what works for me may not work for you. I was convinced that cutting things out would trigger me big time for years though, and I'm so glad I decided to give it a try anyway. I was binging constantly anyway, I really had nothing to lose.\n\nAs I'm coming up on 6 months binge free I'm looking towards experimenting with moderation at some point in the future, maybe this summer once I have more binge free time under my belt. Pre-planning my meals is such a powerful tool for me (it eliminates the need to make decisions in the moment and use willpower) so I will start by planning a treat into my day the night before. I feel like I'm more self aware now so if I feel like all that chatter starts back up in my mind I will get right back to BLE. It is so comforting to know that there is a way if eating that allows me to not binge, so though I hope I'll be able to eat any type of food in moderation eventually, that is less important to me than being in recovery. \n\n", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

If I have to exist I just want to starve for weeks but I'm shit at everything because my mentality is why try when I can just kill myself when I fail. i have been doing well with restricting recently because I want to convince my friend and family that my depression is better so my plan is to just starve until I die. \n\n\n\nthis paragraph is dumpster fire, and a wasteland of bad grammar, sorry.

My history of BED is well documented in my medical file for at least the past 3 years.  I have exhausted all non-medical avenues at this point, and was seeking to go on with the course of treatment I had discussed with my previous PCP (course of treatment was to try everything else before vyvanse, then go to vyvanse if nothing worked).   It has been almost 2 years since that appointment, and I'm binging now more than ever. \n\nI explained this to the new PCP, who was VERY hesitant to prescribe anything. It was like talking to a wall. We talked about cognitive behavior therapy and other ways I have tried to overcome BED. I already workout 4x a week for at least an hour (all my schedule currently allows for as a ft grad student who works 30+ hours a week), and I eat very healthy outside of BED... blah blah, this probably sounds familiar. \n\nAt the end of the appointment, she asked me, \"Have you tried keeping baby carrots in your purse?\"\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n???????????????? IF that's what she is wondering at the end of the appointment, after 50 minutes of discussing my struggle and going into intimate detail my ritualistic binges... she just DOES NOT GET IT. There is a fundamental misunderstanding of what BED is and how it manifests psychologically. I was shocked that someone with any medical experience at all could be so ignorant to BED. Not just ignorant, but completely closed minded to any psychological component. (There were a few other comments, about getting a physical trainer and using will power.. etc.)\n\nThere is no continuity of care here, despite my BED and my previous treatment plan being well documented. It was like I was talking to a provider who never took even the most basic of psychology courses. I felt as though I wasted my time.  I will never go back to that PCP.\n\nI'm frustrated with the lack of understanding surrounding BED. She may as well have been telling an alcoholic to try baby carrots instead of alcohol. \n\nI'm sure such experiences are a dime a dozen here. I'm wondering how we can change the narrative? So many providers are completely in the dark about BED.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I felt pressure on my left leg, and assumed it was my bulging stomach resting on it whilst in this sitting position. This freaked me out, it must mean my stomach is very big. I tried to ignore it, tell myself it's okay if it is my stomach, it's not that important, just ignore it. Forget about it.\n\nBut I couldn't ignore it. I reach down and grab the 'fat'/bulging stomach and feel around... basically just end up grabbing a big load of very thickfluffy jumper (cus I am wearing one) and feeling how it's the heavy duvet also pressing down on other parts of my leg because I'm leaning forward a bit and scrunching up said duvet. Basically in other words, not my tummy.\n\nSo of course, I lift my jumper up, get rid of duvet, and am alternating between leaning down until my stomach *does* touch my leg, and crossing my leg tightly enough that it is at least touching some of my flesh - and telling myself, when it does, 'See?! You ARE too fat!'. Because my body parts are touching other body parts. Because I am purposly doing stupid stuff until they *do* touch. What even.\n\nAnd even typing this out I cannot convince myself that none of this means I am 'too fat' and I'm just being a dumbass (I thought typing it out like this would help but nope... whatever though fuck it, I prefer the 'Doesnt matter even if it is my tummy' line of thinking anyway).\n\nOther example would be looking in the mirror for my double chin. If I don't see one, I squish my face and make one for a 'See? Too fat' moment.\n\nFuckin done with my brain guys", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I know this question is rather different than the rest, but hopefully you can stick with me while I explain.\n\nI run a blog that has over 56k followers; to be vague, it involves writing. It's impossible to keep track of every single follower with that total, but lately I've been noticing multiple people following my blog that post various pro ED content, like thinspo, extremely low calorie recipes, and so on.\n\nIt worries me to see these things, especially from young people on the internet. This is how I was exposed to these ideas when I was that age that led to some very dangerous behaviors.\n\nSo, with these 56k+ followers, I'm wondering if there is anything I should (or can) say as a general announcement or message to sort of let them know that EDs are a serious matter, that people do care, there is help to be had, and this is not something to be taken so lightly.\n\nIs there anything I can or should do? I want to help, and right now I feel like I'm witnessing a crime and doing nothing to stop it. This is a delicate matter, and as much as I don't want to stay silent about it, I almost think it would be better to say nothing than risk saying the wrong thing. I don't care if people unfollow me, but I do care if I were to push someone further into the ED void.\n\ntl;dr - How can I use my blog with 56k+ followers, more and more of which are pro ED blogs, to raise awareness about the dangers of EDs?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.

I just finished talking to my roommate who is also anorexic (that's how we met) and generally just a better typical ana than me. When she's restricting, she gets up at 4am, eats one low cal meal for the whole day, and stays up working until 8pm before doing yoga and sleeping. She's constantly working three times harder than me at least and does it all on half of what I eat. She pushes herself, I just don't. I used to think I was a high functioning anorexic but in comparison to her, I'm the laziest sack of meat on the planet. \n\nThis has been weighing on me a lot more recently as I'm graduating soon into a field that is notoriously competitive for any job (liberal arts rather than stem). I've always been worried about my inadequacy and how that affects job prospects but now it's becoming more real and leading to major self worth issues. I'm in a class for my last semester that evaluates all of my work against my peers and I'm realizing how low on the totem I am. I'm only now getting how much I should've been doing and while it's not too late, I'm way behind in experience. \n\nThis isn't too uncommon and the recommendation from the professors is always to just go hard and try to make good work to make up for it. The way the class and my program works, this means working on a variety of different areas rather than the one specific one you care about to become well rounded. Which is great but involves a lot of effort if you're like me and have big holes in your portfolio. \n\nBut, I just don't want to do it. I SHOULD want to if I care and am passionate even if the work doesn't directly relate to my passion because doing the work will benefit my probability of getting to actually do my passion. But again, I don't want to anymore. I'm realizing I'm the kind of person that when they're told they're not good enough, they more often want to give up than try harder. \n\nEspecially now when I'm somewhat regretting going with this specific program. I'm trying VERY hard to not be a serial quitter like my abusive mom. I'm cognizant of my gut feeling to always want to give up if I'm not at least 90% invested in the thing. I've done it before and I'm stopping myself from doing it now to hopefully not be even more behind when graduation comes. \n\nAfter talking to my roommate, I'm worried that it's not the major or the class or anything but me that's the problem. Am I simply too lazy for life? Am I setting myself up for a life of inadequacy where I'm never able to reach my goals because I'm too depressed to do the work needed? \n\n*TL;DR I'm beginning to really have that senioritis crisis that seems somewhat normal but I don't think I'm exaggerating the problem because I'm hearing directly from multiple people that I'm not going to get a real job because I have nothing to show for any work or passion.*", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I just need to throw some thoughts out there. None of this is probably very helpful.\n\nIn these last few years my ED has shifted, and me along with it. I\u2019ve become more self-aware, I\u2019m finally able to admit I have an ED and a severe one at that. Somewhere in the murk of my mind I do realize that what I\u2019m doing is harmful, that it could kill me if I don\u2019t stop. But that epiphany is still a fair distance away, I know it but I don\u2019t feel it. It\u2019ll come when it\u2019s ready, just like the realization that I had a very real mental illness did. Ten years a little late but hey, could be worse, right?\n\nAt this point in time right now, I am doing the best I\u2019ve ever done. Last year was full of challenges that in the past would have broken me; my four year long relationship ended (amicably, though not without its own struggles), I had to leave my house to move back in with my father at 26 years old (we aren\u2019t close for good reason), dropped out of school for my mental health, couldn\u2019t afford therapy or get that medication review I really still need, it\u2019s just been hard. But I did what I needed to do and I got my shit together. In fact, in the process I stopped purging almost completely. I threw away my scales, stopped counting calories, I put as much effort into my recovery as I could because if I didn\u2019t keep pushing forward during this shift in my life, the only other place I\u2019d be guaranteed to go is backwards. I had spent years learning to manage my depression and anxiety, there was no way I could let myself unravel like that.\n\nBut somewhere along the way I stopped eating. I got good at it, and everything else it seemed like. I\u2019m in a wonderfully healthy relationship with my new partner (and I swear I\u2019m gonna marry him), I got a raise at my job, am volunteering at a crisis hotline, have made new friends and overall have really come to value myself as an individual. I love myself, I really do. I don\u2019t want to be anyone different. This isn\u2019t even really about my body anymore. I could stay at this weight and be fine, I\u2019m not happy with it but I\u2019m also aware enough to know I never will be so it is what it is, most days. This is now about me and how it feels good to finally feel in control of this thing. Even if I\u00a0know\u00a0it\u2019s still controlling me, it doesn\u2019t\u00a0feel\u00a0that way. It feels good. It feels structured. It feels like I just want to do this for just a little bit longer. It also feels guilty.

The truth is, I didn\u2019t argue with my psychiatrist when he misdiagnosed me with BED a few years back, he doesn\u2019t need to know we hold very different definitions of what a binge is. It wasn\u2019t my proudest moment when I went back a few months ago to tell him that I wanted to get on amphetamines again, or when I dipped into my savings account to afford the medication I didn\u2019t need that my insurance wouldn\u2019t cover. Or when I started countering my fatigue and hunger with Adderall, or when I lied to my therapist about it, my boyfriend, myself. I mistake my high functioning disorder with progress because that\u2019s what others call it. But it\u2019s not and I wish I felt that.\n\nI have therapy on Friday, my first time in almost three months. I want to tell her about the med abuse but I know that if I do, I have to stop. I have to stop. I have to stop. If I don\u2019t, I might never be able to stop. I might never have that future I\u2019m working so hard for. I might lose this relationship, I might lose all of them.\n\nI already know what I\u2019m supposed to do, now if I could only stop feeling like there might be another answer out there, I might make some actual progress.\n\n\n", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I've had anorexia on and off since I was 16, I'm 22 now. I've done therapy/dietitians/meal plans and none of them permanently fixed the problem. I think I know why they didn't fix me though, it's because they didn't change the base thoughts that created my eating disorder. The things I held as truths, and have until recently. For example:\n\n* There is an ideal body type for a woman. If she looks like this, then she is objectively more attractive than anyone else.(features such as thin toned thighs, completely flat stomach, miraculously still a nice booty and big boobs)\n* I need to be perfect, in appearance and in achievement.\n* Having a larger body is unhealthy and undesirable and would ruin my life  \n\n\nThis time around in recovery, I've done my best to educate myself on the influence of diet-culture as well as the importance of unrestricted eating in recovery(meal plans be damned, that shit did more harm than good for me). How could I gain the weight I needed in recovery, if my truth was that having a larger body is unhealthy and undesirable? How could I be non-judgmental of my body if I believed there was an ideal body that I was not displaying? How could I recover and accept my faults if I needed to be perfect?  \n\n\nI needed to unlearn my truths, which is where opposite action comes in. Opposite action to me means, whatever your eating disorder would tell you to do or think, do the opposite, actively. So if I looked in the mirror and felt disgusted by my bloated tummy, I'd shut that thought down, then go opposite and be like \"You're tummy is hella cute, you are hella cute. You're value as a person is not tied to your appearance of your stomach\"  \n\n\nAlso, in educating myself on the HAES (somewhat controversial but I like the idea) movement and diet culture, I've backed off of the idea that there is an ideal body. There is room in this world for all sorts of body types and all sorts of features and none are objectively more attractive or better than any others. I try to look at people of all shapes and sizes and think something positive about their appearance.  \n\n\nI'm also just going easier on myself, I don't need to be perfect. I can fuck up, I can fail, I can look bad or mess up or get fired, and I would be just fine. The world would keep turning and I would still be me.  \n\n\nNone of this happened overnight, it's more me trying to break down my ED thoughts from the base so this shitty disorder can never take more from me.  \n\n\nDo you guys have anything in particular that has helped you?

I HATE doing that to someone I care so much about. \n\nLately, I've been able to eat 400/600 cals meals with her since she encourages me that eating together makes her happy and she likes to see me eat, and that dispels guilt and all since she's so sweet, but the minute I'm alone again it's back to fasts and 700cal daily limits. i know that would upset any caring partner. She found out I just smoke on my breaks instead of eat and weigh myself 5 times a day and got really upset and asked me to throw out my scale (which I have in my house for medical reasons for a family member, so i couldnt). We talked about EDmemes and tumblr pro-ana nonsense and laughed before, but I know it hurts her to see me still internalizing ED thoughts and struggling since she got away and healed from her disorder. I know the thoughts of b/p pop up in her head still; I'm terrifed if it's because of me.\n\nI want to recover too since I think she's so brave for that, but I feel guilty and shameful to keep having these behaviours and hiding them, since I did it without hiding before and I know it makes her sad.

The next thing I remember is standing up in some guy's bedroom, seeing double, trying to figure out what was going on. He was a friend of a friend of a friend whom I had only met a few times before.

PIV and anal since I was hurting, even though I'd never done the latter before. I asked him if he had used a condom and he said no, that he had assumed I was on birth control. He offered to pay for some dinner because \"\\[you'll\\] need to pay for Plan B or something\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked him if he was OK to drive me home and he told me that he was totally sober and hadn't had anything to drink all night. Then he told me how much he had wanted to have sex with me from the first time we met, how he had known I was gay but thought he'd try anyway, how he hoped he hadn't taken advantage of me. He repeated that last bit over and over on the drive home. \"You don't think I took advantage of you, do you?\"\n\nWhen I woke up the next morning at 8 AM I was still drunk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt took me a long time to realize that I'm not OK.

It took me a while to differentiate between overeating, emotional eating and binging, so I thought I would share how I tell the difference. If anyone has a different definition, please share! These are related to my personal behaviour, and isn\u2019t a \u201cone size fits all\u201d. \n\nOvereating: eating a larger portion of food because it\u2019s delicious and I\u2019m treating myself. For me, this always happens in social situations, and usually when I\u2019m going out for dinner with friends. I feel full and sluggish afterwards, but not remorseful.\n\nEmotional eating: eating food not because it tastes good but because I want to eat. Almost always high carb, salt, fat and/or sugar and low in nutrition. Usually unplanned and in response to stress, depression or anxiety. May consume with a close friend and can verbalise that I feel bad so I want to eat bad. Afterwards I feel gross and sluggish. \n\nBinging: eating through compulsion, without full comprehension of my behaviour and with a sense of urgency. Food may be undercooked or raw because I can\u2019t wait for it to be ready. Usually fast food, so I don\u2019t have to leave the car or risk being caught eating such high quantities. Eating occurs with a sense of disassociation. Always consumed alone and in secrecy, and I ensure I hide any evidence of the binge. Afterwards I feel depressed and shame and am usually in intense physical pain from eating so much. Usually happens at night and results in a \u201changover\u201d type feeling the next morning with a low mood for the next 24 hours at least. \n\nI\u2019ve always been an emotional eater, but a deep depression and PTSD evolved my emotional eating into binging. I haven\u2019t binged in over 140 days, but I have engaged in emotional eating, and did so tonight. The road to recovery is so long, but the journey is full of insight and realisations.

In the past week, I've been trying to adapt a harm reduction model. Example would be I allow myself to get a McGriddle from McDonald's, but I don't allow myself to get a muffin despite craving one (I did this this morning).

My experience with resisting OCD compulsions and changing the way I think felt like carrying a ton of bricks up a mountain. It was fucking hard. And it scares me that my recovery (although worth it) could be the same with food. Resiting urges and depriving myself of food will be/has been painful. And how do I want to cope with that painful experiences? That's right, food! When I resist the urge to binge, it triggers the experience of loss. Almost like I'm shedding my personality without purpose. It becomes so hard in those moments to give up the ritual. A ritual that is so tied to how I have coped for many many years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure what I'm looking for in this post other than to just strike conversation with others who have the same struggle.

This usually results in me having to grocery shop 3-4x per week, and going to several different grocery stores. Spending an hour or two going through food and eventually picking out stuff I feel safe with (usually lots of fruits/veggies, lean protein/seafood/eggs, halo top lol, a couple safe/light frozen meals, maybe a small loaf of bread or thing of tortillas or some oatmeal packets). Aka stuff thats not calorie dense, and won't last long. Even if I plan out meals I still usually only end up buying 2-3 days worth of things.\n\n\nProblem is, this shit A: takes up so much time, B: is mentally exhausting, C: I spend SO MUCH TIME AND MONEY on food.

Hitting that made me realise that I was never going to be satisfied with my weight and I was going to starve myself to the end. Around the same time my parents started monitoring my food intake 24/7 and making stuff for me, and that made me start to more or less maintain. Having to maintain was mentally crushing but after a little while I suddenly had this weird breakthrough, like my body hadn\u2019t gotten thinner and I wasn\u2019t super mad about it.

I know you should consult a doctor etc and DIY recovery isn\u2019t the best idea but idk I\u2019m just terrified of going to a professional about it for a number of reasons. \n\nSo I got into intuitive eating and just listening to what my body wants.

Recently I feel like everyone has something to say about my body. \u201cYou\u2019re so tiny I could pick you up with my pinky\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019re so delicate\u201d, \u201cyou have the figure every girl wants\u201d, or even just mundane things like comments about how I\u2019m too small for something or the clothing size I pick up at a store. If I\u2019m being honest a part of me still loves to hear stuff like that but when I see myself in pictures all I can see is a sick, deprived, grotesque body and I don\u2019t know why people glorify it. My face is so corpselike and my hair just looks lifeless too. I cringe every time I see myself on someone\u2019s story etc. That\u2019s not the only thing though, other people love to tell me how horrible and scrawny I look, especially my dad. I mean it\u2019s not wrong but I\u2019m trying my best and it hurts to hear because it makes me feel like my hatred towards my body is justified and that people will always be disgusted by my body no matter what I weigh. \n\nI think the fact that my weight is going down even more is concerning people now though. I stayed over at my friends flat last night and before we went to sleep she made a massive speech about how she used to have anorexia and how she was worried about me and that she was always here for me (I haven\u2019t really told her about my eating issues). It\u2019s nice to have people that care about you but it also makes me feel bad for worrying people and being a burden. I don\u2019t want the people close to me to hurt because I suck at something as basic as eating. \n\nAnyways yeah sorry for being a downer this is just some stuff that\u2019s been on my mind, would\u2019ve preferred to post it to Peach but it\u2019s been down for so long. For the most part I\u2019m not doing awful and I\u2019m determined to kick this stupid disorder. Also I hope I didn\u2019t sound like a bitch or anything at any point, I love all my friends and family and they\u2019re incredible. ", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Binging was so normal to me that it didn\u2019t seem like a disorder. In the past year I lost about 90lbs from CICO. But I stilled binged on the weekends usually. I\u2019ve been stuck at a plateau because I can\u2019t reduce my daily intake anymore and can\u2019t make my binges any \u201chealthier\u201d or stop binging.\n\nSince coming across this subreddit I feel like I\u2019ve become more aware of my binging. I have been able to name this monster within, which has been super helpful.\n\nThe past couple of weeks I have been trying to focus on going binge free. One thing I tried is to reduce how much restricting I do. I was eating at my TDEE and introduced foods I never had. Ice cream is a huge trigger and I began by having a pint in my freezer. I ate the first few pints in the days when I bought them. But slowly I was doing good \u2014 I could have a cup or 1/2 cup per day.\n\nSo then I started introducing cookies and chips. I would have one serving. Controlled it, treated it as a small daily snack here and there. All within my CICO goals.\n\nThen this weekend struck. I had been stressed at work and also school. Then I just ate everything. All the ice cream, cookies, and ordered pizza. Then when I ran out, the next day I bought more and ate another package of cookies. During the workweek I haven\u2019t had as much stuff in my apartment so its gotten better, but I been eating way over my TDEE through take-out food. Multiple days over 3.5k calories..\n\nI feel like I have lost control and am scared. This is the longest binge period I ever had. And the most calories I\u2019ve ever consumed in a week ever. Part of me feels like I am using the excuse of \u201cintroducing\u201d treats to be able to binge. Is focusing so much on binging, making me bing???

My trigger is sugar -- more specifically, I've come to find out, switching from salty to sweet to salty, over and over. Now that the sweet is totally out of my life (I can't tolerate any artificial sweeteners, for their taste and their effects on my gut), I really just don't want to binge on any keto foods. The thought of eating something greasy makes me feel sick. That's rather common these days, queasy yet hungry.\n\n\n\n\nI feel hungry, but that's okay... There's no monster inside me telling me to eat everything in my kitchen anymore. Maybe that's because I've already polished off all the Almond Rocas and Lindt truffles and frozen pastries two weeks ago. Well, as they say, if you don't buy them... \n\n\n\nYes, so keto is really helping. Can I quit now? I guess I'm looking for someone to give me permission to not be on some form of a diet. I can't imagine my life without baking fancy cakes and eating noodles with my friends and enjoying my mom's home-made traditional treats that I hope to one day learn to make just as well. So, I mean, I don't know anymore. It feels like one sadness has been replaced by another. I can't believe my crutch, my dependence on this stupid macro group could have such a pervasive impact on my life. I think about eating donuts and cereal all day and I can't remember the last time I didn't go to sleep hungry. I suppose my moodiness also has to do with my weigh-in today, which wasn't where I wanted it to be. The number was so high. I've been working so hard. Why do I slave over this diet, these weights, this modern-day torture machine called the treadmill? Keto has been great for controlling my binge eating, so long as I remove dairy (I've become somewhat of a cream cheese fiend. It becomes quite restrictive, but I can deal with it), but it makes me unhappy that I can't enjoy, like, 90% of the great food out there and I massively lose out on the social aspect. Binging makes me unhappy and fills me with regret, even more than the numbness and euphoria that the food filled me with in those brief moments. I guess I just traded one for the other. The thing is, weight loss who? Not me... Keto is not even helping me to lose weight, my lifts and cardio suck, and I'm eating incredibly little. I feel trapped. I don't want food to be the first thing I think of when I wake up, and the last thing I think of before I go to sleep. I just want to be a normal person and eat like a normal person and not suffocate in my own thoughts.\n\n\n\nAnyway, if you made it this far, good luck to the rest of you fighting this battle. I suppose I just needed to vent. I have an exam tomorrow, but what overwhelms my mind is what meal I should eat afterwards.

I had two beers in the handicapped stall of the restaurant that operated beside the main wing. \n\n\nI stuck the box in the microwave and waited for my dry, fishy and salty treat to heat. I looked at my dog and stuck my forehead into her thick fur. She smelled of coconut powder and in there was something that can only be described by an incident we all have had purely, out of misguided interest. She was fresh out of the shower and rubbing herself against the leather couches that are sprinkled in my house. I picked up and smelled what you already know, is a condense of egg shells that have been sitting out in the sun for two afternoons. I gagged and sat her down. \n\n\nI got on the floor and hugged my once wet dog before pouring garlic chili sauce onto the fish patty. I took a bite and thought of what I tried to have for lunch. Unfortunately, the remains of those savoury soy pancakes, stuffed with peppered chicken mayo and in another, a whole egg fried that stuck onto a cake filled with ham and cheese.

She sat on the floor and her eyes watched good, nutrition fall into the basket which the bag was in. The goop changed in colour, as did the taste when the chili sauce finally said things to the insulin levels in my body. \n\n\nAnd then it was time for dinner. I took the burger out of the microwave and walked past two boxes on my kitchen table. If you'd told me then that I would have saved time having them all at once, I wouldn't have believed you.

And so we ran to the entrance of campus, we shared a cigarette and darted across the road to a store owned by a man who knew us by name. He placed a pack of cigarettes on the counter, and he rang up the liquor we split a fifty on. \n\n\nWe drank fast, time limiting. \n\n\nAt the bus station across campus was an area famous among students, for where disciplinary officers would catch and charge students for smoking on the grounds. We were about to walk through it when there was a girl I'd seen many times before. She taught me things when I was younger, things my parents never did. She brought me to a restaurant with three of her friends. They made fun of me, they asked questions I had weak answers to. Things about life, things about friends, the world, music and everything in between. I said I was lonely, and I asked them if they'd be open to hanging out like this. They laughed and asked me to leave. \n\n\nAnd there we were by the bus stop. She looked as attractive as ever. Her hair was long, brown and flowing. I barely saw her, my mind blurred by whisky. She stopped me, said hello and asked how I was. I told her I was doing okay and I asked her the same thing out of courtesy. She grabbed my belly and said, \u201cyou grew up.\u201d\n\n\nIf you are reading this, and I don't know why you still are, you ought to know that this was a time right before, when I threw up black coffee from feeling guilty. Cigarette meals, caffeine pill snacks.

My mind is completely messed up and I am just barely holding on.\n\nI have recently started a therapy for anxiety, with Paroxetine. I found out that a common side effect of that drug is weight gain and I immediately got TERRIFIED. My psychiatrist dismissed my fears, saying that the weight gain (if it even happens) is usually due to the fact that people under meds have a better mood and therefore often eat more and they don't just put on weight randomly like that. But, while I want the meds to work, I KNOW that I am not yet in a healthy enough place to be able to stand a weight gain that not only would put me at a weight higher than I have ever been, but that I didn't intentionally choose or actively committed to. Staying at my current weight is hard enough in itself.\n\nWhile my general anxiety has somewhat improved since I started the therapy, my obsessions with food have actually worsened because I am trying to preventatively \"make up\" for any possible weight gain that might happen in the future.\n\nShould I be more direct with my psychiatrist and ask him to give me other meds? I am so afraid that at some point my fears will become too overwhelming and I will just decide to quit the therapy altogheter, with obvious disastrous effects. I know some are more weight-neutral than paroxetine, but weight gain is listed as a side effect for most if not all the meds of this kind. At the same time I know that I can't function without meds.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

Ever since day 1, I haven't missed a day. It's been a solid 2 weeks I'd say. I've even gotten a good routine disciplining my eating habits. However, yesterday I got free tickets to go to the rodeo. I made sure to bring only a few dollars for discipline. Turns out, the free tickets I had was for a Suite. Turns out, in this particular Suite, everything is complimentary. A small buffet, an open bar, and a dessert rack (it was like a full bakery's worth of diabetes)\nAnd honestly, if I had not told myself, \"I'm going to have something small and that's it.\" I probably would've fine. But I'm still so early in my grooming myself to be disciplined, that it became like, idk, a snowball effect or a gateway. You get the idea. I knew better, and I chose otherwise. I'm not mad or upset, I just need to have a very honest conversation with myself and remind myself that becoming healthy really, truly is something that I really want. \n\nAnywho, so today I started strong. I figured I'd get right back on the horse and stick with my routine. And I was doing good again. I even felt energetic and checked off a few extra items on my to-do list. By the time i was getting ready to go to the gym, I became stressed out and overwhelmed due to parenting my kids. And felt that familiar trigger and skipped the gym and went to get a luxury drink at one place and then stopped at a gas station to get another snack fix, and ended up adding another snack while I was waiting in line. \n\nI'm at home now, feeling stuffed and shitty. I'm stressed and overwhelmed. I have short triggers for the stress. I don't know how to keep these moments (the stressful situations) from.happening to avoid the triggers. I'm struggling to find peace and learn how to cope when these situations present themselves because they continually happen throughout the day. \n\nLogically, I have no problems or confusion with making sense of how these situations occur or that it's part of the deal when you become a parent. I'm completely aware and genuinely believe I'm not a victim of my circumstances or choices, etc. \n\nI'm struggling with getting to that point of not letting my default response be getting a fix of this snack or that snack, because it tastes good and gets me out of the house. \n\nI've planned to go to support groups, but I dont have child care. I'm wondering if maybe I'm doing more okay than I think I am, and I'm just dismissing it because I'm having an episode. Maybe I just need to be patient and I'll see more days pass in between each episode. \n\nI don't know. Maybe this community could be a great empathetic tool to help keep me grounded when I'm feeling another spell start to warm-up.\n\n", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I'm 23 and I've spent the entirety of my life just like being a complete and utter pyscho about my food and my body. and if I'm being totally honest, approval from others.  It's been a long journey- full of weight changes. I also know it's never gonna end, my adult hood is going to be this bullshit too. I didn't leave it behind at 13, or 15, or 18 or 22. Like it's part of me.\n\nI was doing like pretty good for a long time. I got a job that I love even though it's high stress and really hard. It became my new top priority (rather than the amount of calories I eat) I just went to work and went home. I needed to eat or my job would be at stake. So I ate.. Was I only able to eat a full meal if I took 15 bong rips? absolutely. Would I pick apart my stupid expensive meal at a company dinner praying no one noticed from time to time? yeah sure. Did I drink bottles full of salt water when I was stressed? 100%.\n\nBut for the most part I was pretty happy. But I was like fuck yeah I'm going to be as normal as I can be. I was able to like have actual romantic feelings which I thought my ED took away from along time ago. But then my friend from High School killed herself. The third person to commit suicide that I grew up with in the past 8 months. Out of the three, she was the person I was closest to , she was the first friend I ever got drunk with, all my silly teenage becoming a women things. A lot of mistakes but mistakes that have a nostalgic shadow over them. And then I got sick, my brain. I mean more sick, or whatever. I started buying food to not eat it, making over the top meals for my loved ones so I could watch them eat taking bites here and there, crushing food, playing with it. Back to my normal.\n\nThen I had to take two fucking weeks off of work, two fucking weeks. Which like I can'[t](https://t.NO) handle. No Schedule? Free time? I was at home sharing a room with a teenage brother. Meaning waking up at noon, smoking stupid amounts of weed and vaping (yay 4 nicotine my ED's favorite drug). Maybe a beer here and there (EMPTY CALORIES OH MY GOD). It meant hanging out with college kids so again just like brian numbing amounts of weed and  cocaine( which isn't even my thing even though it fits so well with my ideal/chosen lifestyle- a skinny sales pro) Basically I was just fucking my brain chemistry up until I got back and stared my super serious high pressure promotion.\n\nBasically it's been bullshit thing after another which for any normal person would be like oh whatever- another friend died in a car accident, boyfriend but also really NOT boyfriend (that situation is really a fucking emotional MESS now on its own)   has to take a CPA test and never has the time to see me (the fact that I'm 23 years old and I'm still crying over math tests is so stupid haha), none of my fucking clothes fit me not even my underwear, and my job kicks my ass from time to time. I feel like I have no control, which for someone with food issues is literally the worst. As I'm sure anyone reading this knows.\n\nI've started attending ABA and it really helps but it's only on Fridays at 12. I have to go back to work after and like it's not fun making cold calls and talking to tech CEOs right after you cry about childhood trauma or whatever stupid bullshit that makes me feel less than. Do you guys think it would be fucked up to go to a over eaters anon meeting on Saturday?  Like would they not want to hear about my shit? Or should I just suck it up and go to ABA?\n\nP.S: I know this a lot uhhh but if anyone has any advice or guidance? what helps you? also how do you get better at talking about it? without like crying? I talked with my man friend about my eating stuff and was crying so hard that he teared up which just made me feel like emotionally manipulative.\n\nP.P.S: I like really always feel guilty for being like this. I'm pretty successful for a 23 year old, I'm allegedly a good looking girl (not that I believe that but people say it sooo maybe it's true) my parents love me, I have a wide array of friends (even though they're far away). Like I have all these positive things going on in my life and I can't be fucking happy. I have access to food and cant eat it but there are so many people in the world who go hungry not my choice.

When growing up my mother regularly forced me to over eat, intentionally piled my plate while drilling in \"you can't waste anything\", while you can't finish food when you're full you either have to be uncomfortable full to the point you're almost sick or you might get hungry later. If my mother wasn't around I could and would just eat like normal.\n\nMy mother claimed she only did it because she was starved as a child by her parents. Yet I think what was more likely is because she is fat and always has been fat since I was a child she just wanted me to be as fat as her. Ironically my fat mother started calling me 'fat' before I was even fat like getting me s to xs clothing despite being a normal weight so she could call me fat for not fitting them, then forcing me to over eat. She always commented about my weight then one day when I was 16 I told her 'you're fat too' and her logic is 'well you're a kid'. Well I probably would have had a fighting chance if she wasn't my mother.\n\nAlso this year I was diagnosed with ADD and have found studies of ADD and binge eating going hand in hand. While medicated I do not binge eat yet need to take breaks from the medication. Due to binge eating the highest weight I went to was 120kgs, I've gone back down to the two digit range (without medication) but still need to lose a lot of weight and have therapy. I've also changed to a more vegetarian diet.\n\nMy relationship with food is trash and caused by almost 17 years of basically forced feeding and overeating that escalated in disastrous habits.

To intermittent fasters, extended fasting is anything over 24 hours. They say things like fasting does all of this stuff, and I actually had someone try to tell me that my body would be able to differentiate between fasting and calorie restricting, in the sense that if I fast and calorie restrict, my body won't burn my body fat, but just store it. But the thing they don't seem to understand is that if you engage in intermittent fasting and eat one meal a day that you're also calorie restricting. Unless, you're eating huge meals and essentially bingeing every time you eat, then you're restricting. \n\nIt makes me so mad because some how they're trying to tell me that I won't lose body fat from restricting, but I will lose weight from fasting. It's entirely nonsensical, but you can't tell me that anyone who goes from eating 3 or 4 meals a day to eating one or two wouldn't lose weight!

How no man would ever want a girl as ugly as me. How much she hated me. Pizza face. **Every single day** she would point out how bad my skin was. At the time I never realized how deeply it affected me. Not even one kid at school made fun of me. But my own mother did!\n\nI also grew up as the ugly kid, which did terrors on my self confidence growing up. \n\nThat time was pure misery. I never left the house. I spent hours in front of the mirror puncturing cysts and letting my skin bleed. It was awful. I hated waking up every morning only to have this painful, disgusting skin. \n\nI got my hormones in check and my skin cleared. Years have passed now, my mom is dead, I'm on my own doing pretty well from the outside perspective. (although I am grateful for the life I have made for myself despite my struggles). But I still have minor skin issues due to a digestive problem I have (intestinal permiability) as well as BED, they are two of the most clashing things ever. \n\nEven just one small blemish causes me to go into this depressive mode.

I don't think that at all about other people ; only about myself. I hate that I'm this way but even though I'm trying to let go of the idea of Perfection, I can't help but want to be that.

I began listening when I was 15 years old. His voice is distinct and solemn. Their themes are the Great Lakes (USA), nature, wind, waves, cycles, and hunger.\n\nI thought, wow 15 years his words have been with me. It made me reflect on this passage of time: time is scary and never-ending. I reflected on my eating disorder: constantly buoyant, sinking with the eventual rise. His words: raw hunger and the cyclic nature of life, always lost and always wandering. \n\nAs I get older, my vision of what life \"is\" exponentially reverberates in every direction, changing faster than I can cognitively keep up. Tangents of tangents. Back then, my eating disorder was only x, y, and z. At nearing 30, it seems that same darkness seeps into my whole alphabet, a-z. Like a horror movie, engulfing the screen as the scene fades to black. \n\nI snarl at 15 year olds who do not understand their eventual side-effects of their eating disorder. Only because I am projecting. I am projecting the disdain, the anguish, and the emotions I have for my 15 year old self. Stop! You fucking idiot! Stop! \n\nAt 15, I thought once I stopped starving I would reach this pinnacle stage of adulthood where happiness resided and I would snuggle right in. I thought, \"This will allllll stop when I really just TRY.\" I lied to myself. Denial wore my skin like a well-tailored suit. Am I in control of my body or is my body in control of me? Who's a slave to whom? These questions keep me up late at night.\n\nI am very good at layering sad thoughts away. (This comes with age, I suppose.) \"Does this spark joy?\", as I scan old, sad emotions. \"No\", I shake my head. And I tuck that sad, 15-year old thought into a locked box. These boxes multiply over the years. Does anything bring me joy? I fold my life into thirds and discard. \n\nHis songs unlocked some forgotten boxes, I guess. \n\nThe older I become, the sadder my eating disorder becomes. It's old news, it's pathetic. I'm a meat sack with the same problems everyone else has too. Cycles of cycles. Rise and fall. Breathe in, breathe out. Moon phases every month. The constant echo of water droplets as they hit the bottom of my shower. It will get better, it will get worse. This is life/Is this life? I hate food/I love food. I hate myself/I love myself. I can do it/I cannot do it. Lose parts of myself/lose more parts of myself. Will this ever end? Has it ever ended for anyone?\n\nHave I made my eating disorder into some deep, hippie, pseudo-spiritual-transcendent monster that engulfs every philosophical component of my life? Should I just tuck these thoughts away in a locked box?\n\nAs you know, Pavlov's Dog is the term for the experiment by Ivan Pavlov. [From wiki:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning) He taught a dog that when a bell rang, he would receive food. Eventually, just by ringing a bell, the dog would salivate in anticipation. It was a breakthrough experiment that displayed learning conditions and psychology. \n\nDid I biologically and psychologically condition myself as an 11-year-old to my eating disorder? Gain weight; sad, failure, ugly. Lose weight; less chaos, calming, at peace. Logically, I can separate those basic components and easily disagree with them. Emotionally, I FIGHT to not feel those almost automatically. I am 18 years away from my 11-year-old self-- is that not long enough? I picture deep, ingrained, neuro-biological valley's in my brain: I diligently carved pathways as an 11-year-old that will never, ever go away. It must be permanent. So my brain avoids all of these valley's so I can recover from my eating disorder. But my eating disorder is a-z, whole alphabet. My whole life. Everything. The valley's are everywhere. It's scar tissue. It's everywhere I look- real life horror movie. \n\nIs anyone that one character that got away in the movie?\n\nAnyways, I'm rambling incoherently I think. Ebb and flow. Life. Ring a bell and I cry. \n\n ", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

{"post_id": "ar1u9g", "created_utc": 1550268057, "title": "Finally broke the cycle of binge eating!", "author": "NiceIceX", "self_text": "So I started binge eating two years ago. I started it up after developing a disability which made me really depressed. And to cope with depression, I began binging. The binging was so bad I would bloat and look like I was pregnant and my breathing would become shallow. I went from 95 pounds to 145 pounds. Every time I would get depressed feelings, I would just eat as much as I could. And the binging just made my depression get worse, it didn't even help with the emotions. After a binge, rather than just feeling depressed, I'd also feel guilty and remorseful. And the guilt and regret would just cause me to binge some more when I was less full. It was an awful and physically uncomfortable and painful cycle.\n\nI decided recently that my binging was just a bad habit. Not an addiction. When I looked at it that way, it was *much* easier to change. Back when I looked at it as an addiction, I felt hopeless and like it would be impossible to cure. When I viewed it as a habit to cope with emotions, it became easier. For example, when I'm anxious, I bite my nails. Would I consider it an addiction? Nope. I looked at binging the same way. Once I began looking at it as just a bad habit and coping mechanism, I began to make a list of activities I could replace it with. Things like coffee, going for a walk, taking a bath, playing with my dog, reading, listening to music, and a bunch of other things. \n\nSo I began trying things until I found out what stuck. The bath thing didn't work because it would dry out my skin and waste a ton of water. I didn't need six baths a day. Going for a walk wasn't good either. Since I'm disabled, sometimes I can't walk and sometimes it just snows. But, I realized as long as I had my phone I could listen to music and read as much as I wanted. So I replaced binge eating with music and reading. \n\nWhenever I felt the urge to binge, I would set a 20 minute timer on my phone. I agreed that if I still felt the urge to binge after 20 minutes, then I could do so. Whenever I felt the urge to binge when feeling depressed, I'd immediately plug my headphones into my phone, put on some music, and begin browsing Reddit. Favorite subreddits to browse when depressed are r/wholesomememes, r/earthporn, and r/upliftingnews. I like looking at wholesome stuff, nature pictures, and reading happy news articles. \n\nAt first, I found even after 20 minutes had passed I still had the urge to binge. But after two or three weeks, even once the twenty minute timer was up I still found myself wanting to continue listening to music and looking at Reddit, rather than binge. I no longer get urges to binge at all when depressed. It doesn't even cross my mind. I really hope this helps some people. Basically to sum it up:\n\n1. Make a list of coping methods for whatever emotion causes you to binge. \n\n2. Try out various things on the list and see what works best for you.\n\n3. When getting the urge to binge, set a 20 minute timer and begin doing an activity you picked from the list. \n\n4. If the timer goes off and you still have the urge to binge, then binge. It's all about delaying the binge as well as getting your mind into the habit of doing something else instead.\n\n5. You'll find that you lose the urge to binge eventually. Because you train your brain to seek that dopamine release in a new way, and it begins to crave that new way. \n\nI really hope this works for other people. It helps to also change the way you think about binging. Instead of viewing it as an addiction, view it as a bad habit. If you view it as a bad habit, it becomes so much easier to change. Viewing it as an addiction gives it more power than it actually has. ", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

At age twelve, I began restricting, due to a lot of factors. I dropped to 185, which tasted so good, I needed to drop to 175, 160, 150. \nWhen I was seventeen my mother tried really hard to help me get a breast reduction. I was denied because my bmi was too high... I weighed around 145 at that point, but I needed to lose more to qualify for the surgery. I was told that if I really wanted smaller breasts (they were and still are breasts too big for DD cups, and cause immense pain, but more on that later), I would be working out even more, doing everything I could to lose the weight in my breasts and bring myself to a healthy and acceptable weight before I pursued surgery. \nI just COULDN'T DO THAT because when I exercise I take it to a whole other  level that my mother was freaked out by. And so I kept the breasts, though I would  have lost ten pounds from the surgery. (Yes, they were weighed. Twice.)\n\nI currently weigh 139.2. I'm still five one. I still have too-much-for-my-DD-bra sized breasts. \nI'm finding myself calling myself recovered... but all I think about is the scale. I think about how much I resent my body for growing a self destructive  brain and then crushing itself with the weight of my chest. I think about my freaking  32 inch waist and how nothing. Nothing nothing will make me feel better until I'm flat chested. \nI think about how unnecessary all this fucking fat is and it's on my body, a parasite. I don't even want my nipples if if would be too much of a hassle to augment them. I don't care about them. I don't see them as a sexual organ at all, not even a sensual one or even a functional one. I want kids some day but I'm also a lesbian and plan to adopt. I do not need them, I do not want them, they cause so much pain in my upper back that just accentuates lower back pain. They make my shoulders ache. I can't lay down in any position without my bones hurting. I can't raise my arms for extended  periods of time. \n\nBUT I'M SO FAT A REDUCTION WOULDN'T BE MEDICAL....IT WOULD BE COSMETIC. Thus out of my reach. \n\nI don't know what to do and I don't know where to turn and I'm very close to being very near the end of my rope. Idk what response I'm looking for. I just hate feeling alone. \n", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

When I met my boyfriend (and his coworker M) I weighed around 250-270lbs (I was in a period of denial and refusing to use a scale) that night I weighed 225.\n\nI proceeded to heavily B/p (with a lot more p than b, some days probably negative in calories because of n.e.a.t. from my job) for the next week and lost an additional ten pounds or so. Back to \"normal\" (for me) levels of disordered behavior and I've gotten down to 212 as of this morning (ALMOST IN THE UNDER 200 CLUB WOO!!!! - *ahem* sorry).\n\nI don't regularly see many people, I'm kinda a homebody when I'm not at work, but (almost) everyone who does see me is all compliments and support. \"You're doing so good!!\" \"You look great!!\" \"Your clothes are so loose on you!!\", \"How much have you lost!\". Etc. \n\nOnly my roommate actually addresses the real issue, but she's bitter that she's not losing weight, so from her I get comments about how she wishes she could throw up to be skinny too, or \"I can't eat like that, I'll gain weight. Probably because I digest it, though\" (like, yeah, I have an eating disorder. BUT ***you*** wouldn't have to have ED to lose weight if you didn't do shit like eat snacks while waiting for your dinner to cook, hmm, Karen?- ok, that's mean.. She probably has unacknowledged BED or something, idk, it's hard to be understanding about someone's possible ED when she's being a bitch about mine, lol. but that's a whole other issue). \n\nAnyway....

Most people say the disordered habits never really go away.\n\nI just... I think I'm at a point where I'm okay with that risk, or at least okay putting off dealing with it until I \"get there\", because having people proud of me for what I'm doing with my body feels so much better than the alternative.\n\nI just keep thinking of all the people who haven't seen me in a while (I'm not active on social media, especially pictures. I hate my picture being taken and even more sharing it) and what they'll think when I suddenly start posting a ton of skinny/sexy pictures. How many of them wouldn't recognize me, when I finally reach my GW.\n\nAnd, compared to that a little heart trouble risk seems... Inconsequential.

It definitely reduces binging for me, even if I feel panicky that I can\u2019t get my safe meals when I\u2019m out and preparing food seems impossible. \n\nThoughts?

I always remember myself binge eating here and there since I was younger but nothing that was too concerning. Although I am still working on myself a year and a half later, I have for the most part overcome my depression which was linked to my abusive relationship with my ex by following a healthy positive lifestyle. When I was in that relationship I almost failed my masters degree in architecture due to the circumstances but somehow got it together and managed to graduate on time. I have spent a lot of time wishing I left the relationship earlier. Ever since I moved alone again, I have been the happiest I have felt in years and have enjoyed every moment of rediscovering myself and growing as a person. Unfortunately, as I live alone in a new city I often find myself resulting to binge eating on nights that I am not with other people. I have met so many amazing people and I work full time which both have helped. I have tried to change this by going to sleep by 11pm and working out 4-5 times a week in the evening to keep myself occupied. I also ended up starting a second postgraduate course at UCL at the same time as working full time as an architect so I am really busy. I wake up daily at 5AM, go to my office early to study for a few hours before work and then in the evening I go to the gym. My new found self discipline is really paying off and I feel like I am finally the healthiest best version of myself. \n\nThe problem started when my first essay deadline approached. I am so stressed out trying to balance everything and so traumatised by memories of nearly failing my masters that I cannot study. This is so overwhelming that I end up eating to the point I feel sick. And this keeps happening over and over. In fact it hasn't stopped happening since Friday and it's now Sunday noon. I have tried everything, working out 5-6 times this week, being extremely organised, allowing myself breaks and fun activities to stop stressing out.... aromatherapy, treating myself, going out for walks, drinking 3L of water a day, eating healthy..... not eating as healthy....practically everything! No one can tell I am going through this because my life seems perfect to other people. It's like everyone is so proud of me for achieving so much and managing to juggle everything but on the inside I am not doing well. I am basically desperate to stop this. My stomach aches and I feel so uncomfortable but I don't know what else to do. My essay is going okay though. \\*facepalm\\*\n\nAny help would be amazing, thanks in advance.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

During a christmas party, I once ate 4 cupcakes in a row and its so good and bad at the same time. I feel like Im throwing up and deep inside Im slowly breaking down because of the horror I've done. I went to the bathroom and I somehow imagined my face getting bigger and fatter because of what I ate. I cried and I forced myself to puke it out.

My current psychiatrist made an urgent referral to the psychiatrist from the ED program (it usually takes months to get an appointment with her).  So I'm seeing her on Feb 28 for a consult.

Maybe I can even get into the ED program faster.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy PHP psychiatrist asked why I want to be in the ED program if I don't care about getting sick (valid question, but it threw me off), and I realized I'm so addicted and attached to my ED and losing weight, that I don't want to lose that, but at the same time I know I need help.

I gained a lot of weight a year and a half ago, Since then i felt basically like a fat disgusting failure. I used to be attractive now people are repelled by me, even my own girlfriend would constantly talk about my weight, people would laugh at me behind my back etc. I nearly threw up every time I saw myself topless. i had periods of dieting but could never get back to my old weight.\n\nA few months ago I discovered the online fasting community and they are huge on water fasts. For those who don't know a water fast is where you drink water but don't eat any food or consume any calories. they encouraged me to fast as long as possible and I did for a long time. I lost a lot of weight but I think it hurt my body, I felt so weak even though I took all the suggested vitamins and minerals.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips for me? Is this an actual eating disorder? I'm not sure it is, because I don't actually want to be thin it's just happening. How do I start eating normally again??. Apart from the binges I barely eat at all and I throw all that up so I continue to lose weight. I keep no food in the house because im afraid of binging. I don't know why I can't just stop. Before I water fasted I had never really binge ate before. I feel disgusting again, even though I'm not fat, and everyone wants to know how I could lose weight so quickly and I just have this humiliating secret.\n\nThere is zero chance of me ever going to the doctor for this. I need to learn how to get over it by myself. But every time I eat a normal portion of food it leads to a binge so idk what to do. Drinking stuff with calories in is okay for me, it doesn't usually lead to a binge. But I still get anxious about the calories. I've had this \"eating disorder\" for about two months now and I now want to be healthy again. Im almost underweight and I look like shit.\n\nI started exercising at the start of January, I used to exercise a lot before I put on weight and I thought it would make me feel like myself again and it kind of does, but i push myself very hard and because I'm not eating enough I get very dizzy and have horrible headaches.\n\nMy gf is so sweet but she has no idea what's going on with me, I cringe at the thought of telling her I have this \" teen girl problem\" I know she will think less of me. But maybe she knows already though idk. She hated it when I was fat and definitely prefers me like this. Should I tell her?\n\nI know recovering is simple, I have to start eating but I can't seem to do it because every bit of food I put in my mouth feels like poison I have to get rid of. I've started eating fruit and vegetables though and I think that might be helping. I don't usually have the same urge to binge with them.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips for me? Is this an actual eating disorder? I'm not sure it is, because I don't actaully want to be thin it's just happening. How do I start eating normally again??\n\nThank you", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

I know I have weight issues and issues with my body but I can't tell if I have an eating disorder or if everything I do is just the product of those. Any advice is tremendously appreciated especially as I can't afford to see my therapist and my doctor is booked months out.\n\nThere are a few specific things I've read of that concern me, but I don't know if they should or not. If I step on the scale my mood will be affected for the rest of the day based on whether I weigh more or less than last time i weighed. I go through periods of eating anything I see to eating nothing unless someone prepares something for me (I'd feel guilty turning them down). I can't eat anything without thinking of how many calories are in it. I think of most foods in terms of \"If I eat this, how much time do I need to run on the elliptical to burn it off?\"\n\nI've seen these and a few other things talked about as being parts of eating disorders. But there are a few things that confuse me and make me not sure. The first is the fact that I go through those periods of just eating everything, like whatever's driving me to not eat just disappears for a while. I would think an eating disorder would be all the time. Second, I'm completely afraid to say anything for sure about myself because I have a long history of *trying* to have something be wrong with me (pretending that I have asthma, ASPD, insomnia, etc. to the point of convincing myself it was real). At this point I don't know when something is actually wrong with me vs when I'm just being stupid and making something wrong. The only difference is that those lasted a few weeks, this cycle has lasted years which is why it concerns me more. With that, I'm afraid if I say anything to anyone they won't believe me either, because why would they trust me about it if I don't trust myself?\n\nAgain I have no idea what to think or what to do. If I do have some eating disorder, it doesn't seem to line up with any of them I've read about. I'm looking for any advice whatsoever (aside from \"see your doctor therapist\" cause I can't really rush those, they'll come when they can).

This has made it insanely hard to stay focused and think rationally about my own dietary habits. \n\nThe main issue I deal with is the one that kind of started my whole history with anorexia: I feel like when my mom \"isn't hungry\" or doesn't eat more than once or twice in a day, that i'm doing something wrong by eating when I'm hungry. This is something that plagued me even as a small child, before I had the capability to realize it's abnormal. As an anorexic teenager, it made being anorexic easier because I could act like her when I didn't want to eat; just say I wasn't hungry and move on. Now, however, it causes me guilt when I eat which leads me to justifying everything I eat to her when she's around me. She says there's no reason for me to justify eating, but being around her makes me feel like I do have to justify it..\n\nI guess what I'm asking is does anyone have a similar experience, and if so, how did you deal with it? Because I'm stuck at home, it's hard to escape those feelings.

I\u2019ve been overweight my entire life and near the end of high school that turned into being obese and being diagnosed with diabetes.  I never had a healthy relationship with food, it\u2019s always been something that comforts me emotionally and recently I\u2019ve realized that I will never know what it\u2019s like to have a normal relationship with food. \n\nAfter my diabetes diagnosis, I went all out in losing weight, I was/still am on \u201cKeto\u201d (not really because I was too scared of the fat so it was more like protein and veggies) and lost about 60 pounds since August and am now at the high end of being \u201cnormal\u201d. Everyone always says how amazing it is including my parents but the truth is I was starving myself. I would eat one meal a day consisting of a salad and chicken and as time went on I started thinking even eating that was too much. When I binged on snacks I would fast for the next two days to make sure my weight went back down. To be honest I really didn\u2019t even see anything wrong with that at the time. \n\nWhen I was on holiday and back home I started binging really bad because I knew I would never allow myself to eat those things in college. I gained about 10 pounds during the break but lost it again by restricting near the end of break. After I got back to college I broke down and bough $40 worth of junk food and binged and ended up giving it away to my dorm mates to prevent myself from eating it again but I was seriously considering asking for the food back. Along with the stress of college, managing my diabetes, and trying to get to my goal weight I just feel so hopeless. I\u2019ve been binging for the past few days and bawling my eyes out afterwards and I feel pregnant and I just really hate myself right now. I guess all this post is really for is to get my feelings out and to try and find some reassurance. I always thought losing weight would fix my issues but now it just feels like everything is worse.

I haven\u2019t been the best owner I could be in the past couple months anyways. I know my whateverboyfriend/exwhatevermaybe will take care of her but not provide the same attention to her needs and symptoms as I would. \n\nBoyfriend or whatever he is right now (I\u2019ll just call him Guy) has been a total asshole to me today. I could talk about it a lot but I don\u2019t want to make this post even longer. But he left for the night. Like We talked when he was waking up this morning for work but I was going to take a nap at the time so it was like 7 minutes of meaning less stuff in person. Everything else was over text which idk he\u2019s blowing out of proportion. I honestly feel like he has several cognitive distortions and other unhelpful thinking styles going on which are making things that are valid complaints that we can work on into these huge deals. He trashed talked me to his family today and I just feel like it\u2019s over but I\u2019m a stupid bitch so I\u2019m going to drag it out and try to make it work. \n\nI could go on with the things going wrong but I\u2019ll end it here for now I guess. \n", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

When I do it at night that often means I end up staying up way later than I mean to. I also very often get so excited about a new meal plan that I can't sleep. I made a meal plan just now that's low in cholesterol, the exact amount of calories I should be eating, has at least 100% of every nutrient (vitamins, minerals, fiber, fats, and proteins) without going over the max amounts for any, and it's all liquids (smoothies and shakes) except for a small snack of 20 almonds that I would eat at work. I literally can't wait to try it out because all of the foods I would be eating are so good. I have a carrot cake smoothie, a peanut butter cup smoothie, and 2 meal replacement shakes that I've had in the past and really enjoy.

It's a cute lil place but big for one person. \n\nAnywho. I worked up an appetite, I hadn't eaten since Friday, and I was really upset. So I got online and ordered a huge binge fest from pizza hut.\n\nWe don't use the front door, it is inaccessible. This is in an area where it is very common and normal to just go through the alley way to the back door instead of using the front door. (Obligatory that's what she said....?) So I put in the special instructions in the delivery section to go through the alley and go to the back door. This usually goes over just fine. It is what I ALWAYS put for delivery and I have NEVER had any issues with it before. \n\nSo anyway. We had a huge snowstorm over the last 24 hours. I haven't shoveled the front yet, but like I said everyone uses the alleys instead (dont need to shovel the front because mail carriers and trash collectors etc also all go through the back. Trash is collected in the alley and our mailboxes are also back there) \n\nSo the front was not shoveled, but the back was. Complete perfect pathway. \n\nThis dude came and parked up front, walked up my un shoveled sidewalk, front steps, and yard, went through my gate and unlatched it to walk around the back yard, trudged through 2 feet of snow all that way to go to my back door. \n\nThen he banged on my door way harder than warranted, and when I answered it he shoved my food at me and told me \"24.82\" so I counted out 34 and reached out and the dude snagged it out of my hand real rough and said \"next time you order at least shove your walk!\" And stormed off. \n\n1) I have ordered from the same pizza hut a trillion times and the \"deliver through the alley\" has never changed and has NEVER been a problem so obviously the have the directions. \n\n2) 10 bucks on a $24 total is a pretty decent tip, but I guess that since he couldn't read the directions everyone else there understands, I should have given him more.... \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nSo anyway, I closed the door and stared at my food and was too angry to binge anymore.

I am now 270 as a 5\u20195 17 year old female. It\u2019s terrible on my back and knees now, to the point where it would be dangerous to go back to cheer. I had to order knee braces for both legs so i can relieve some of the pain. Clothing shopping is the worst of it all, all my pants rip, no shirt fits me for more than a month.... I can\u2019t even try clothes on without having an anxiety attack. It\u2019s all like a horrible cycle of binge, feel ashamed, compare my body to other women, starve, and repeat. My mom is signing me up for a course with a psychologist to see if I can fix this, it\u2019s a couple months long and I pray I can get help and have some order. I just want to be at peace. If anybody has any tips for me please please leave them below. I\u2019ll post an update later on during my program course if anybody ends up caring alot about this post. I figured posting here might be a little therapeutic and help me get my feelings out here as opposed to my kitchen. Thank you for reading this if you do.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

For a while I was underweight and restricting. Then I was eating too much and I\u2019d binge until I was sick. I was later diagnosed with binge eating disorder. I have gone back and forth to over restricting and then bingeing for a couple years now. \n\nLast year I got bad food poisoning and then a few months later I went into anaphylactic shock when I randomly developed a bunch of new allergies. Both those things caused some anxiety that food might kill me.\n\nThe other night I ate some food and I\u2019m not sure why but I kinda thought afterwards the food must be bad and I would get food poisoning. I\u2019m scared of throwing up so I never tried to purge even when I had wanted to after a binge. This time though, the anxiety about getting food poisoning was just too high so I did purge. It wasn\u2019t nearly as terrifying as I thought it would be and now I have done it a couple times. I never wanted to get to this point. I feel like I never have control over my eating, I either am bingeing or I want to eat less and less once I\u2019m restricting and can\u2019t really control it. This has only been a thing for a day or two now but I\u2019m already worried it will be out of control. I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t want to start doing this but I feel like now that I know I can, I won\u2019t be able to help it and I\u2019m afraid to tell my therapist because she is a mandated reporter and I don\u2019t want to go into the hospital. I had accidentally made myself throw up a couple times before but not a full purge because I also have Tourette\u2019s and when I\u2019m really nervous I have a couple tics I don\u2019t normally have, one of them is needing to gag. I\u2019m not sure why. I\u2019m afraid if I start doing it, the tic could get worse. I have no idea if that is how that works but I\u2019m scared to bring it up.

I\u2019m going to outline what I think triggers my binges, and the approach I am going to take. In addition to using this post to hold myself accountable, I am happy to take any advice you may have.\n\nOkay so I haven\u2019t been diagnosed with BED, so I may just be experiencing disordered eating behaviours rather than a full blown BED; however, I just ate 9 protein bars in the last 24 hours, and its not the first time I have consumed 4+ protein bars in one sitting. My go-to foods are Oh Yeah ONE Protein Bars, Chocolate, and Protein powder w/ oats. Fortunately, I just ran out of protein bars, and I don\u2019t think I will be buying more ever again.\n\nWarning: Very long post, but I hope you read it and give any advice if you think I\u2019m doing something wrong.\n\nSo firstly, I\u2019m going to outline the things that I think trigger my binges:\n\n1. Loss of structure\n\nSo I tend to binge when I lose control of my diet; it\u2019s kind of a positive feedback loop. Just the other day I went to all you can eat sushi with my friends, because I thought it\u2019s a bad idea to remove enjoying food with friends from my life. I thought I would just eat a small amount there, but that\u2019s not how all you can eat sushi works. Hence, I was pressured by my friends to eat as much as I could. As a result, the next day I was calculating how many calories I just ate and how many weeks it would take to cut the calories back again. This stressed me out a lot, and next thing I knew, I had just downed 6 protein bars.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of like a \u2018might as well\u2019 response. When I am on track, I am less stressed, and I know that I can continue to stay on track. When I come off track, I become more stressed, regardless of whether I chose to remove my structure on purpose or by accident, and the stress causes me to binge.\n\n2. Stress\n\nSo another reason I binge is stress. For example, when I have an assignment due and I have procrastinated on it, etc. I tend to turn to food as a means of procrastination and distracting myself from doing the assignment. I remember one time I literally ate from 3 hours before the deadline up until the deadline had passed, and I did the assignment the next day and received a late penalty on the assignment.\n\n3. Hyperpalatability and trigger foods\n\nOkay so sometimes I\u2019m not really stressed out at all, no upcoming assignments, I am following my diet structure, but I decide I will fit in a single protein bar, or a small piece of chocolate. I start eating it, and I enjoy it so much that I decide I will have another one. And another. Next thing you know I just ate 5 protein bars. I do consider protein bars and chocolate to be trigger foods, even though I have consumed them in moderation many times.\n\n4. Mindless eating\n\nSometimes, rather than focusing on enjoying the food I am eating, I may be watching a video or a show while eating, and that causes me to eat a lot more, since the other activity distracts me from my food.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--------\n\nNext I am going to outline the methods I will use in the upcoming weeks to start breaking this habit:\n\n1. Structure\n\nSo since structure helps me stay on track, I will start following a specific structure to my diet, especially since I have had no structure for the last week or two. I have decided to eat at maintenance calories: 2200 calories daily, @125 lbs (5\u20192\u201d Male). This is actually my BW x 17.6 calories, which is pretty high I think, but I try to move around a lot during the day, as well as doing resistance training. I will be eating around 130-140 grams of protein, 280-320 grams of carbs, (of which 35-45 grams will be fiber) and 40-60 grams of fats. I will also be eating very similarly each day, 4 meals around the same times: 8am, 12pm, 1pm (snack), 3pm, 6pm, 8pm (snack).\n\n2. Avoiding hyperpalatable foods and trigger foods\n\nFurthermore, I will not eat hyperpalatable foods that will be available in my house (I cannot get rid of them as my parents like to eat them). This restriction will be placed for a variety of reasons:\n\n\u00b7 The food palatability reward hypothesis, which says that the better a food tastes, the more of it you will want to eat\n\n\u00b7 The gut microbiome also feeds on what we put in our body, and sends signals to our brains when it craves what you have been feeding it. Imagine giving your dog cocaine and then next thing you know your dog comes nagging every time you come home for cocaine.\n\n\u00b7 To resensitize my taste buds. So our taste buds are actually pretty versatile: if you eat a very high salt diet, your taste buds will need more salt for a food to taste salty, similarly if you eat a very sweet diet, your taste buds will need more sweetness for a food to taste sweet.\n\nHowever, I will not place a HARD restriction on hyperpalatable foods. It will be a SOFT restriction. This means I will not use hyperpalatable foods to satisfy my physical hunger. My main course of my meals will consist of whole foods that are not hyperpalatable (they will still be tasty food, like fruits, meat, eggs, etc, but not hyperpalatable foods, like popcorn, which triggered my binge today, or oatmeal with a really sweet and good tasting protein powder). This means that if I have a desire to eat a certain hyperpalatable food, I will eat after a satisfying and satiating meal, and I will eat it in moderation.\n\n3. Having distinct meals instead of lots of grazing\n\nI will have 4 main meals during the day, as well as a night time snack and a pre workout snack.\n\n4. 5-HTP\n\nOkay so this one is not really very important, but this a supplement that helps deal with emotional/disordered eating, and since I tend to binge later in the day, I will take it after the meals I eat in the evening.\n\n5. Meditation\n\nOkay so this one I think is super important to do, but I don\u2019t have much knowledge in this area. If anyone has any tips, please advise. Maybe some sort of meditation with a trigger food right in front of you, and you resist the urge to eat it? Or maybe imagining eating the food and what it tastes like? Anyways, I will try to find atleast 10 minutes a day to meditate. I think it will help me be less stressed, and be more aware of my thoughts and feelings, which may help me be more aware of my urges to binge.\n\n6. Sleeping lots\n\nThis is not hard for me since I love sleeping lol. But anyways, I think it is fairly safe to say that sleep deprivation increases appetite, which may cause binges, and sleep deprivation also increases stress, which may also cause binges\n\n7. Eating mindfully\n\nSo rather than eating while watching a video or watching TV, I think I will simply focus on enjoying my food on its own, and enjoying my TV on its own.\n\n8. Response to urge to binge/ a craving\n\nThis is a 7 step plan that I made\n\n1. Drink a glass of water and take a deep breath\n2. Walk around for 5 minutes\n3. Ask myself, are you physically hungry?, If so, then EAT!!!\n4. If not, then spend 2 minutes to try to figure out why you want to binge\n5. Spend 1 minute imagining eating the food and what it tastes like\n6. If you are still feeling the urge to binge/ a craving, then eat the food in question in moderation, slowly, enjoying every bite\n7. When you are finished eating it, appreciate that you did not place a hard restriction on yourself, and you allowed yourself to have a SPLURGE instead of BINGE\n\n:)\n\n-\n#9\n8. Journal for accountability\n\nSo I\u2019m going to make a google docs where I am going to document every day my experiences: whether or not I had any urges to binge, any cravings, whether or not I ate out at a restaurant and how I handled eating at the restaurant etc.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PW9K1e3sDdhVZhyapdAjnGSzTiAYOuaJyDV\\_P6HyWU4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PW9K1e3sDdhVZhyapdAjnGSzTiAYOuaJyDV_P6HyWU4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n10. Tracking my hunger-fullness levels\n\nOkay so one of the problems with tracking calories is that energy expenditure is not really consistent day to day, so if one day you move around a lot, you may need to eat more calories. On the other hand, if you spend a lot of time sitting during the day, you may need to eat less calories. It is pretty common to see people who track their calories forget that their body even has hunger and fullness signals. So I\u2019m going to track my hunger-fullness from 0-10 before each meal, as well as 20 minutes after each meal. I will track this on the same google docs as #9. 0=Ravenously hungry, 5=Not Hungry nor full, 10=Absolutely stuffed\n\n11.

Intermittent fasting has been a way for me the last few days to quell my urge to eat at all times, and the keto thing is just basically guidance on eating less sugar and more high quality foods and more fats which are actually truly satisfying! I'm doing neither keto nor intermittent fasting perfectly, but I've adapted both things so they work for me. And I know three days for many might not be long enough to say something is working, but for me three days of actually not binging is HUGE.\n\nJust want to say for all the people struggling- keep trying, keep trying new things, and don't feel defeated when you can't do something \"perfectly\" - because that imperfection might just be something that gets you on the right path.

I had a CT scan and an MRI, as they thought it was multiple sclerosis. Turns out, I was just so severely malnourished that I had peripheral neuropathy.

I noticed that I lost weight faster at the beginning when I first started restricting, and I was eating 800-1000 calories a day. I recently got down to 400 a day and I was still losing weight, but it was SO slow it was driving me fucking nuts. I was disappointed every day after weighing myself because I wasn\u2019t losing much, if anything at all, day to day. And someone here recently asked if it was true or a myth that your body goes into starvation mode and clings to everything the lower you restrict, and it\u2019s like 99% a myth, but I think I\u2019m in the 1%, like I am losing weight so much slower than I was before, and I\u2019m not even like truly thin yet so it\u2019s not like my restriction limit is starting to become my maintenance limit (400 calories a day is not maintenance for ANY weight anyway lol). So anyway, I am going to put my limit at 700 calories for a couple weeks and see how much weight I lose. I burn way more than that every day at work, so I still net negative calories, but negative 200 or a bit more, instead of negative like 800. Maybe if I eat a little more it won\u2019t \u201ccling\u201d to me since I won\u2019t be \u201cstarving\u201d? Idk. It\u2019s still a negative net so...idk. It\u2019s a two week experiment, and if it doesn\u2019t change anything, and especially if it slows down weight loss even further, I will just go back to 400 lol. If the result is the fucking same, slow as hell weight loss, I feel a lot less guilty eating at 400.\n\nAnd related to daily disappointment after weighing myself every day, I\u2019m gonna weigh weekly from now on, or at least try. I did that for the first month and a half or so of restricting, but then started weighing once a day in the morning, and as long as there was good progress I loved doing that, but at this point with losing weight so slowly I\u2019m tired of being irritated every single day first thing in the morning after I see a disappointing number on the scale. I weighed on Friday (I weighed every day before, but now just once a week after the first of each month, so the rest of this month will be on Fridays, and next month as well) and it\u2019s KILLING me to not weigh again until next Friday. Yesterday was so hard, I wanted to wake up this morning and weigh so bad but I looked in the mirror and decided I thought I looked a tiny bit bigger and I didn\u2019t want to see what I weighed, because if I AM bigger rn and there is confirmation of that, I will lose my shit lol. I don\u2019t think I am, I just think that without having a lower number every day to look at, my mind just has no idea what to think about what I see in the mirror rn. But I think it\u2019ll be good for me. I won\u2019t see fluctuations or mini plateaus day to day, just a weekly loss, and that\u2019s it.\n\nBut yeah, I don\u2019t have work today so I\u2019d burn no calories, and since I\u2019m not weighing every day, I can\u2019t confirm tomorrow that food I\u2019d eat today didn\u2019t set me back any. So I\u2019m making absolute sure that doesn\u2019t happen, by still netting negative calories today. So I walked enough to surpass the calories I plan on consuming today and then some lol\n\nDISORDERED?? WHO, ME???", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I won't eat the whole bag. I am.not going to go to multiple fast food places, I am.not going to go to the gas station for snacks and treats and fountain drinks.

My eating disorder has become more prevalent within the last 3-4 years and I have been in a really rough road of recovery since 2015ish.  \n\nMy husband and I have recently started going to couples therapy and I have found a new therapist because my eating disorder is destroying my marriage. I haven't have sex with my husband in 3 years. Just the thought of being naked in front of him causes my anxiety to go through the roof. I know he loves me and doesn't care what I look like, but the ED voice is so much louder than common sense. We have just started the sessions. Today was our 3rd and I feel progress is going so slow. Every time I think about what needs to be done to repair the gaps in communication and intimacy I get this huge pit of dread in my stomach wondering if it's ever possible? If I don't do this and really work on getting better, my marriage will be over. I don't talk to him about my good or bad days. We are basically living like roommates right now. Lately my husband has been travelling a lot for work. As of this post he will be in town until Thursday when he leaves for Spain for 2 weeks and then comes home for less than 24 hours before leaving again for the west coast for a week. I feel that his travelling has given me an opportunity to keep my bad communication habits because it's a lot of work to text all my ED thoughts to someone.\n\nMy question is does anyone have any advice that helped them bridge the gap with you partner when recovering from an ED?

If you want to have enough fat to have an insta-booty your waist gets bigger too, which is absolutely fine, however, instagram models facetune their waists smaller to make up for it. Or have the small waist from surgery.  \n\n\n  \nRecovering from an eating disorder is hard enough without getting bombarded by #strongnotskinny #instafit #fitfam posts every 2 seconds.

I dont exactly remember the reason why i started doing it, but I do remember feeling very lonely and not really belonging anywhere during those times. Did that for about a year and then grew out of it but when I turned 15, my eating habits became out of whack again and I also always felt the need to lose weight. i wasnt even over wight. then when i was 16, this became even worse as i developed anxiety disorders and couldn't even bear to eat most of the times due to my anxiousness. I got through with that, but then came the binging. For the most part of my 11th grade, i binged and binged and gained so much weight. for the first time in my life, i became overweight. i would hide food and then eat it when everyone is asleep, or eat during my commute home where i know no one will recognize or remember me. but then in 12th grade, i started dieting and lost all the weight that i gained through eating keto, but then that quickly turned into a very restrictive eating as i would always convince myself to eat less than what i should on keto, sometimes even eating one meal a day only. i was also obsessing with workouts and would do calorie burning workouts most of the nights when everyone was asleep. i stopped doing keto and switched to intermittent fasting but that also turned restrictive as i would always find ways to reduce my caloric intake. i would also obsess over how i look and all the fats in my body and with how i weigh even though people around me say that im already fine with the way i looked. it just never seemed enough. that turned into a cycle or restrict-binge-purge. it stopped for a while when we went on vacation but when we came back, i felt like i needed to lose weight because i gained some on vacation. that turned again into eating only during on weekends and drinking water only on weekdays, all the while dancing for at least 4 hrs. a day. when i started freshman year, it became worse but then m friend would always nag me for not eating so now, when i do eat, it turns into a full on binge which i would purge. its affected me so much already that i nearly failed a class because i would always be in the bathroom purging during class hours instead of actually attending.\n\nNow, im on a carnivore diet because i saw that it can help lose weight (why is there such a need to always lose more \ud83d\ude14) but i just really want my life back. im always jealous of people around me here at university because they seem to not care about what they eat and their world doesnt revolve around calories, and macros, and nutritional infos and exercises and workouts.

The local drive through SBs has gotten it wrong on occasion, leading to a lot of tears etc.\n\nA few months ago, he explained to the woman whilst waiting that I had pretty severe AN, hence why he always had to double check that everything was perfect, otherwise it could be majorly upsetting for me. She sympathised and said she'd watched her sister start to slip into a potential restrictive disorder, but thankfully she hasn't spiraled too far.\n\nAnyway, now a few of the baristas know my order off by heart, and why it has to be so specific. He was waiting today while they brewed the filter and the person at the window explained they actually only let those specific people make my drink, who know how &amp; why, because they don't want to upset me and want to make sure it's always correct. He came home and had the above message written on my cup, and it just really made my day. It was really nice knowing how thoughtful they are, and understanding.\n\nSorry for the ramble, I just have nobody to share this with and I found it really sweet \ud83d\ude1e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Edit:** Thank you everyone, I forwarded on the comments to my dad &amp; will also write to SB to name the branch &amp; hopefully they'll get some worthy praise &lt;3\n\nAlso, my dad has been incredible. He has Asperger's, but the lengths he goes to to empathize with me is something I'll always be thankful for - sadly we've both had to go through this disordered journey over the past year or so, but he's very supportive.

I went from BMI 19 (lowest ever, 19% BF, never underweighy) to BMI 20/21 and was able to eat pretty normally.  Turns out, those issues we're actually related to my recent diagnosis of scleroderma I got later last year. \n\nwith that diagnosis, I am at risk of developing a heart condition that makes child birth too dangerous, so my husband and I decided to go ahead and start trying. I had stopped my birth control, and waited for my cycles to start. \n\nPreviously, I had only one or two cycles a year, which began after I lost 30 lbs some years back. That weight loss was intentional and healthy (overweight to normal, 1.5 lbs/week) and is what actually triggered my ED. For some unknown reason, maybe unrelated to weight loss, but I have barely been able to cycle since then and my hormones are unbalanced. \n\nI began religiously tracking my ovulation, putting in the same energy I would for calories. I intentionally began to gain weight in hopes of jump starting my cycle. 5 lbs and months later, I detected ovulation, and eventually a positive pregnancy test.\n\nI've been able to eat without guilt for the past 8 weeks, gaining an additional 5lbs in the process. Knowing the baby needs nutrition, and that I can blame the gain on pregnancy and not my lack of control, helped. Plus, the knowledge that I can lose it later while breastfeeding kept me sane.\n\nYesterday, I went in for my 8 week ultrasound. I was worrying that I might have twins because it was the first ovulation after so long without, and my hormones were out of balance (it can cause two eggs to drop). The technician spent one minute with the belly ultrasound and said she can't get a clear image. She brought out the transvaginal, poked around saying the OB will take a look and discuss with me after. \n\nI immediately clammed up and worried while waiting for the OB to call me back. Maybe my dates were off and I wasn't as far along as I thought? When the time came, the OB told me they saw the fetus but could not detected a heartbeat. I had miscarried and I can expect to pass the tissue in the next few weeks. My stomach sank, and I've been a wreck all night and day. Now, I lost my baby and I'm left with my fat body and a corpse. \n\nI woke up at 4:30 am this morning and went into 'solver' mode. I can heal. But the way that seems will get me there is to live my old life before I was sick and trying to conceive. Lose those 10 lbs, track calories, track ovulation. Exercise like you did before schleroderma. Fast all day and live on vegetables alone.\n\nI know fixing grief with disordered eating isn't healthy, but suddenly sitting here 10 lbs heavier and no longer pregnant there's just nothing else I want to do more than get rid of this weight that constantly reminds me of my loss. I want to start trying to conceive again asap. I'm a little worried that I really do need the extra fat to ovulate. I can't stand the thought of starting the pregnancy at such a high weight knowing there will be more to gain.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I also was looking for jobs and work shopping my resume. \n\nWithout thinking I ate the whole pizza over the course of an hour just picking at it while working on jobs applications. \n\nI didnt eat much after that and took a nap because I felt full.\n\nI woke up to do more job applications and browse reddit and watch TV because my partner was still asleep and I felt a little peckish.\n\nI went into the kitchen to realize I had sandwich fixins so I made a small nutella and strawberry sandwich and another with praline cookie butter and strawnerry.\n\nI made both with precise care to use less spread than I thought I needed. Maybe a table spoon of each for each small sandwich. \n\nI proceeded to eat these over another hour or so of working and taking breaks.\n\n\nI added up the calories of what felt like a shameful day.\n\nThe pizza could have been anywhere from 750 to 950 calories for a build your own. I logged it as 900 which felt pretty conservative. I got 350 for the bread and 200 for the spreads. 1500 for the whole day after a 60+ hour fast.\n\nI feel like I over did it and should eat less tomorrow but at the same time i feel like this is one of the first time i have eaten intentionally in a while.\n\nI feel bad i didnt work today to necessitate any extra consumption but i feel like 1500 is lower than most binge days I have on my days off. \n\nSo I have mixed feelings but feel like this is what recovery probably feels like but more consistantly. I think my guilt over everything means I am definately still struggling but I guess I know I could attempt intuitive eating and be ok. I just hate that it has been corrupted by body positivity movements that seem to glamorize obesity.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

You can't function. You can't do anything except the anorexia.\n\nAnd guess what? It's still not enough. Because eventually you get forced into inpatient. You spend five months in treatment, get discharged, and relapse again almost immediately after because *it still wasn't enough.* You still weren't sick enough.

Unfortunately, it's winter where I live so outdoor exercise is unrealistic for the next 3-5 months with the amount of snow and ice we get here. I have a strong preference for high endurance cardio, but also enjoy olympic weightlifting too. My BED peaked in severity in the fall of 2018, where I hit 245 lbs (a 50 lb gain within the year of 2018). I started aggressively working on my BED through therapy and group support in October, and lost 15 lbs just through reducing the severity and number of binges every week. I currently have a small-medium binge about once every 1.5-2 weeks (compared to multiple severe binges every week). My main triggers are high stress, high exhaustion, or high sad/anger emotions. I'm the only one working to support my household and family and have zero cash to spend on fitness equipment. I have olympic weights at home, but my strength has greatly reduced and my lightest bar is 25 lbs without added weight plates. I have the programs T25 and 21 Day Fix, but by god I really do loathe fitness videos. Their voices are so distracting and grating! My endurance is at an all time low because of my 85 lb weight gain, so I feel much like I'm starting from scratch. While weight loss is very important to me, I'm trying to focus on just building my physical fitness and let the results fall into place how they may. I have PCOS and fatigue issues that greatly impact me as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would really love to learn about what other people with BED do to exercise (regardless of my preferences) without becoming overwhelmed or triggering binges. I used to follow some fitness/fitness motivation subs, but I found those posts to be triggering, and the advice often isn't appropriate for someone with BED.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI definitely have a \"fear of starting.\" Sort of like I fear failure so my coping mechanism is to avoid any activity I believe will result in failure. I have an excellent track record of starting fitness routines with motivation and burning out within a week (aka failing to stick with it).

My intentions were to, of course lose weight, and eat healthier. I did 16:8, then went on to 23:1, then continued to extend it to 48, 72, and my longest fast which is 5 days. Initially, i was amazed at the self-control i didn't know I had in me. I became better at moderating meals and even choosing healthier options when I do get to eat.\n\nThe problem is that, fast forward to almost a year later, I no longer have a structure. I've thrown the \"You have to eat 3 times a day\" and \"You have to eat or else you'll get sick\" ideologies out the window a long time ago. For the past few months now, I am spiraling between fasting for 2-5 days and binging. I keep having these thoughts of \"Well, I need to eat bcuz I wont be able to in the next few days\", \"I can easily lose this if I just fast\", \"Why can't I stop eating?!\" It's either all or nothing for me when it comes to eating. I thought it was normal until I started reading abt ED posts and relating to them.\n\nI want to stop binging because sometimes I'd just be binging continuously for days by justifying I will fast tomorrow which usually gets pushed back and back and back. I'm worried abt gaining weight and it distracts me from studying for my exams.\n\nAm I at risk of developing ED? I'd appreciate any feedback and advice", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I know my triggers, and I'm seeking counseling. Through daily exercise, MyFitnessPal, and sheer willpower, I managed to get my BED under control for about 3 years back in high school. I lost 25 lbs, and gained more confidence than I've ever had in my life. Now I'm 22 and in college, and I feel like a wreck. Two years ago I went into an intense depressive spiral after events beyond my control shook me to my core. I couldn't stand to be in a crowded dining hall, so I started eating my meals alone in my dorm room. This quickly brought back my secretive eating and binging habits, and over a short time I gained back 20 lbs. One year ago I resolved to take control again, and I was starting to make progress with my mental health...and then I broke my leg doing one of my favorite things - figure skating. Needless to say, the immobility brought on another 12 lbs and more depression, and I found myself at a new all-time heavy. I've been mobile and able to work out (though not skating yet) for several months now, and somehow I've shed 7 lbs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I'm back to the weight that originally was my wake-up call when I was 16 years old, and I'm stuck in a rut. The methods that helped me stop my BED and lose weight the first time around haven't been working. I'm still depressed, for sure, but I was depressed in high school too. I simply don't have the same willpower today that I did back then. My self-control has gone down the drain. I have another year and a half before I graduate, and I'm afraid that things will only get worse from here. My friends and family say that they can't see the difference in my body, but I see it in my face and my stomach, and in how tight my clothes feel. I keep tormenting myself by looking at old pictures and mourning my physique and the happiness I felt back then. I want my life back. I want to be able to resist the urge to eat my trigger foods because I *know* that the guilt and stomach aches will *never* outweigh the numbness of the trance I feel when shoveling those snacks into my mouth. Tonight I binged on the same snack that I ate on my worst ever binge a few months ago. My stomach doesn't feel as awful as I expected, and my daily yoga practice has helped me to be more forgiving to myself. Still, this isn't the way I want to live. **This is my one and only body**, and I need to respect and nourish her so that I can *live my life*. I'm young, so why do I feel like I've already ruined it all? I've made this journey once before, so I know that I have the strength to do it again. BED is something I will struggle with my whole life through, I know this. It's a part of me, but it's a part that I *can manage*. I'll have my good days, and my bad. If I slip up, that doesn't negate the progress I've made. Today I am committing myself to a new respect for my body and my soul. They exist hand in hand, and I refuse to let BED get in the way of my love for myself. ", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I wear baggy jeans and a belt to create the illusion that my legs aren't literal bones with skin.\n\nI know these things get taken up in therapy, but I currently am in a program for anxiety, depression, ADHD and PTSD. I'm also on meds that have for the first time in my life given me an appetite. But I can never bother myself to make a meal.\n\nI'm a person that needs routine. ADHD and PTSD really mess with me because I am always in a cycle of being too distracted to eat, and when I do eat I will end up spitting food out, vomiting, or only eating a little bit because the taste or texture is offensive to my taste buds. For example, I avoid eating food with canola oil in it. I worked at a fry joint where they would never clean the frying oil, the smell was awful and lingered, had to throw out my work clothes and quit. Now just smelling it makes me lose it.\n\nMy mom also triggers me. She's a faux health nut and reads too many articles about the risks of eating too much rice, or corn, or seaweed, because they are toxic and will make you ill for reasons unknown. She buys into it and then tells me not to eat certain foods, reinforcing my already bad habits and limiting my food choices.\n\nGonna go to a group session soon for this, but I just need to feel like there's other people out there with insight.\n\nAnyone got any idea how to start a little meal plan, or how they plan food around a busy day?

I've always been a healthy weight but can feel myself getting weaker. My body has never looked better but am I pushing it too much?\n\nHi, I'm 21F and over the past couple months it's been really hard for me to eat, to the point where I have practically no appetite anymore. I was studying abroad last semester, and ever since I've been home/back at college here, I've felt the need to eat less and less. I'm currently long distance with my girlfriend, and I wonder if that has something to do with it, as it's been difficult for me to eat in the past when I've been in that kind of sadness.\n\nI have no history of mental health problems, although I occasionally get quite anxious but it's never felt like enough to do something about, and have always been a healthy weight, playing sports year round all my life until college. I've exercised sporadically the past couple years (once or twice a week), but I tried running on the treadmill last week and after 10 minutes felt very weak and had to leave, even though I'd had yogurt and cereal before. I've always been fine with my weight, although I was never the smallest, but I have a pretty athletic and toned body even though I'm definitely losing a lot of the muscle I had in high school. I've been happy seeing my face and legs get slimmer and my collarbone and jaw get more defined. I haven't been able to weigh myself since I've been back at school, but at home I do quite a bit and would try to keep it between a certain range. Before school I was just a bit into the healthy weight zone and I'm afraid I'm under it now because I can definitely feel my lack of eating taking a toll.\n\nI usually take normal amounts at the dining hall for breakfast but I can never finish much more than half, then I'll snack throughout the night and maybe have something a bit bigger for dinner. It's quite hard for me to finish most things I start eating, and I feel bad for wasting food so I get frustrated with myself. I'll not eat long enough so my stomach hurts, but it's rarely until then that I even feel hungry and I feel really hungry. Then I'll take a couple bites of something and not be able to have any more. I drink a decent amount of water, but I eat a bit of candy and haven't been getting as many veggies as I do at home, just lots of plain carbs and fruit.\n\nI feel weak, tired, and slightly headachey most of the time, sometimes out of breath. I smoke weed every day and it's never affected my body any way that I could tell, and I still have time to be productive/creative. I'm doing well in school although I feel exhausted a lot of the time and stressed about it, my grades are good. Haven't been to the doctor in a couple years because I haven't needed to, but I know that would be a good step.\n\nI think I enjoy restricting my eating because I've never been happier with my body and just want it to look better, but I'm disappointed in myself because I know I'm hurting it in the long run. I've talked to my girlfriend (she used to have an ED and I think has some relapses occasionally) and she checks in on me, and I've talked to my friend a bit as well but not in much detail. My parents always comment that I look skinnier when they see me and ask if I'm eating enough and I always say it's alright.\n\nDo these seem like disordered tendencies that I should seek help about? Or should I start by trying to force myself to eat more? Just not sure how serious it is/could be, I can't really see myself trying to starve myself until I was stick thin, but maybe it would be too late. I'm new to this.\n\nThanks so much for any comments or advice!", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

First some Stats: (deleted b/c numbers) based on BMI charts I went from Obese to the lower end healthy weight in less than a year\n2. Reasons I am led to believe I have an eating disorder:\n\n\\-I fast almost daily.  How long my fast is depends on if I skip dinner that day as well.\n\n\\-When I do eat dinner it\u2019s the same exact dinner set under \u201cx\u201d calories. (Most days I run on pretty much entirely caffeine and cigarettes.)\n\n\\-Every morning I workout, weigh myself, and then take measurements with a tape measure.\n\n\\-I constantly do wrist checks, collar bone checks, and hip bone checks.\n\n\\-I\u2019ve recently noticed my \u201cbinges\u201d are normal people calories. i.e. the other day I had a \u201clow\u201d cal binge and then did cardio until my fitness watch showed double the calories burned.\n\n(These last two reasons are my biggest shames)\n\n\\-I have purged a after a really bad binge on a few occasions\n\n\\-I\u2019m now a fat shamer. I don\u2019t want to be, in fact i hate it. But I think my brain needs to hate/be disgusted by overweight people as like \u201cmotivation\u201d to no be overweight?\n\n\\*\\*\\****2. Concerns***\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nSo why now?\n\nIn short: It\u2019s ruining my life.\n\n1. It\u2019s embarrassing\n\nNot only am I insanely weak now, I get caught doing wrist checks, my clothes are too big on me and when I buy more, those just eventually become too big on me as well. Lately, my biggest issue has been going out to eat. Friends constantly want to go eat. \\*\\*\\*\\*AND so do DATES. There is a girl i am very attracted to, and we\u2019ve gone on a few dates.\n\nBut I think she\u2019s catching on, because the last time we went out she pointed out how little I had eaten and asked \u201caren\u2019t you going to finish you \\_\\_\\_\\_?\u201d. With a concerned tone.\n\nI instantly was mortified. No one has ever pointed out my eating habits before. Like what if she thinks something\u2019s wrong with me? No one wants to date a broken person.\n\n2. I\u2019m a fucking adult.\n\n\\-I\u2019m about done with grad school and I\u2019ve been going to a lot of career events. A lot of these events involve going to nice dinners with important people. (Clearly an issue)\n\n\\-I feel like most people my age are trying to maintain their health, but I\u2019m over here deteriorating it.\n\n\\-adults have kids at some point? I want kids but I do not by any means want kids being a bad role model for eating habits.\n\n\\-I\u2019m supposed to be \u201cstarting my life\u201d but this is so draining, I don\u2019t have the motivation to start anything.\n\nI don\u2019t even know where to begin. Like I mentioned before, no one has ever pointed out my eating habits before. So as far as I know, no one has caught on. I\u2019ve tried telling my friends and talking to them about. But I can\u2019t bring myself to say it.\n\nAnd then I don\u2019t know how stop. I don\u2019t even know if I necessarily want it to stop. I mean It\u2019s like in theory I want it to stop, but as soon as that scale goes up I freak out.\n\nTL;DR: I don\u2019t eat, I need to eat, but I can\u2019t eat\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan anyone offer advice?

I can't do this anymore.", "author": "owlAfoul", "self_text": "Please, please help me.\n\nI haven't posted on here before, but I used to be FastPhoria on proED for anyone who was a regular around the same time. \n\nI did recovery, but I'm about to relapse. I can feel it, and I know I can't do anything to stop it. I'm just going to go right back to where I was. I can't do it again, I'd rather die.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back was that I think I have lost my best friend, who went through recovery with me. I don't think I can salvage it.\n\nI posted in relationship_advice yesterday and got pretty much no responses. It's a long post so I understand if you don't want to read it all, but I'm just so desperate to feel less alone in this. I can tell that my boyfriend is feeling out of his depth and frustrated with the situation. \n\n*I (28F, living in the UK) am an anorexia sufferer since my early childhood, and 2017 saw the sixth and worst relapse of my life. For eight months, every single day was devoted to not eating, thinking about not eating, working obsessively to avoid thinking about not eating, and exercising compulsively because maybe-just-maybe I miscalculated my calorie deficit last Tuesday. My weight loss was dramatic and incredibly dangerous. The emotional toll was even worse - it was like living in a claustrophobic nightmare. I should have died, I wanted to die, and sometimes I still regret choosing to \"recover\" instead of just lying down and fantasising about Indian takeout until I hopped the twig.*\n\n*Here is where my friend, Heather (29F) comes in. Heather and I met in an online eating disorder support group, and immediately clicked with each other. Forum exchanges quickly became PMs, which then became WhatsApp messaging and ultimately video messaging. We lived in each other's pockets (despite being in different countries), and were in constant contact. We had everything in common - the same sense of humour, the same interests, the same fears. Both of us were overwhelmed with finding our \"twin\", and our relationship quickly became very intense. We talked about everything, we sent each other presents in the mail just to make each other smile, we worked through all of our problems together.*\n\n*I have never had a friend like Heather before; I have never felt so close to another person, and the difference she has made to my life is phenomenal. Heather has genuinely changed me as a person, and I mean that in a good way - not only did we hold each other's hands through the nightmare of anorexia recovery, we have also supported and encouraged each other to take the first steps towards some huge positive changes in both of our lives. In particular, I am making a (terrifying) career change from mathematics to mental health nursing, and she is relocating to the UK for better job prospects. She has saved my life with respect to my mental health issues.*\n\n*The problems with our friendship started when I began to develop feelings for one of my male friends, Alex, who I was spending most evenings with. At first, Heather was very much in favour of me pursuing a relationship with Alex, encouraging me to tell him how I felt and reassuring me that we would be an amazing couple. So I went for it, the feelings were mutual, and we began to date. Our relationship is now very serious, and I love him dearly.*\n\n*Heather has been, and remains, in a long term relationship. She lives with her boyfriend, and they have a dog together (who is a very good boy). She never discussed breaking up with him or being unhappy in the relationship.*\n\n*Things took a turn just after Alex and I began dating. Heather revealed that she had romantic feelings towards me and, honestly, I was confused at this point regarding my feelings towards her. I explained that I was having difficulty understanding my feelings, although I could certainly see myself being romantically attracted to her in different circumstances. We hadn't met in person, and this concerned me. Moreover, I was very happy and excited about my new relationship with Alex.*\n\n*We tried to continue as normal, but things became incredibly strained. Heather was also changing her medication for depression at the time and I know how badly this can fuck someone up, so I genuinely do not believe Heather had any ill intent towards me. However, I began to receive hurtful messages, a lot of which centred around making Alex out to be a terrible influence on me (objectively untrue). I tried to reassure Heather that my new relationship in no way replaced or devalued ours, but this was met with disagreement and I fully admit that at this point I did distance myself from Heather quite a bit. I regret that a lot.*\n\n*One video message in particular stands out in my memory, as it involved her crying as she was driving, and she talked about running her car off the bridge. I believe it was that night that Heather attempted suicide. She phoned me after overdosing, and I did my best to direct her boyfriend to the park she was in. Alex also made efforts to contact her local police station. Her boyfriend found her and she was hospitalised; he contacted me to let me know this.*\n\n*I want to make it clear that there were many contributing factors to her actions, especially the medication changes, and I am still unsure of where on that list our falling out ranked.*\n\n*Heather made a full recovery, and was home quickly. She lost her job and was under constant supervision from her boyfriend and family. I offered to take time off work to fly out and stay with her, or to have her stay over here for a time-out, but she declined. This was a few months ago now, and although we continued talking, it was less frequent and less open.*\n\n*A few weeks ago, Heather and her boyfriend came over to the UK to arrange a property for their move at the end of the month. We messaged back and forth a bit, and discussed me driving over to finally meet. For a couple of days, things felt like  they used to. I was really excited about this, and keen to help them sort out a place. However, as soon as I mentioned that Alex and I are now living together, the conversation dropped off. I have messaged her a few times since, reassuring that I am here for her whenever she needs me, and offering to help with her move. Also obligatory doggo pictures. I have only received one response in the middle of this, which was abrupt and generic.*\n\n*I feel lost and unsure of myself without Heather in my life. I know it is potentially harmful to define myself, even partially, based on another person. However, I believe that our relationships do make up a huge part of our identities and, in this case, the fact that Heather has been so intertwined with my anorexia recovery only amplifies this.*\n\n*Put simply - I love her, I miss her, and my life feels empty without her. The last thing I want to do is hurt her, and I have no desire to pressure her emotionally into a relationship that is not good for her at the moment. However, I am also really hurting as a result of all of this. Although I'm not currently engaging in any destructive behaviour (food restriction, over-exercise, self-harming, or drug abuse), every day it is getting more and more difficult - my head is full of relapse fantasies, and I know that if it were not for my boyfriend helping me through it, this would have already derailed my recovery completely.*\n\n*I just have no idea what to do. At all. My boyfriend can see the effect this is having on me and has kindly urged me to cut Heather out at this point, for my own sake. This idea breaks my heart, but he has (correctly) pointed out that it is breaking anyway - just in slow motion. Meanwhile, I am still holding on to the small chance that things might suddenly go back to how they were; this might sound totally unrealistic, but it is possible with the ups and downs of mental illness.*\n\n*Any advice as to how I should handle this would be hugely appreciated. I don't want to cut her out of my life, and I don't want to hurt her. But I'm so scared that this is going to break me soon.*", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I was also slightly malnourished when I was young (up until I was around 8 or 9) so fifth through seventh grade I only weighed about 50-60 pounds. The entire time. \n\nOnce I hit puberty I started gaining weight, and I didn't care. I got hips and larger thighs, and honestly I loved it. But I was afraid of the number of the scale that came with it. I now weigh around 130-140 and I'm about 5'5\" and I know that that weight is okay, and is normal/healthy. \n\nBut I still hate it. Some of my pants from last year don't fit and it makes me hate myself. Sometimes I'll look at my thighs and wish they were just a bit smaller. My relationship with food has been steadily getting worse and worse. First it was \"just skip breakfast\" and then this year I stopped eating lunch at school because I only had half days. I told my friends I was just eating lunch at home, but I wasn't. I would eat snacks sometimes, but usually just sip on water or juice to forget about it. \n\nNow I'm in a different household, where it's kinda \"fend for yourself\" and they rarely make dinner. They just stock the fridge with microwave food and milk. If they don't make dinner or ask if I want something from a fast food place, I don't eat. I eat when I am hungry, and that's not that often. \n\nAnd honestly, I wasn't that worried or anything until yesterday when I ate some McDonald's and I thought to myself, \" I can't eat anything tomorrow because I'm eating this today\" when I was making dinner the other day I had to choose between two thing, so I looked at the calories to decide which had less. Maybe everyone does this though I don't know.\n\nI've always been aware of people with eating disorders, and I really loved that Netflix movie about disorders, but it all seems like the opposite of me. I'm not someone who would get an eating disorder. \n\nBut now people at the new school will ask why I don't eat at lunch other than the snacks I bring ( which is usually a juice box :/ ). They aren't close friends or anything so I don't tell them anything, and they don't care. And I think it's nice.\n\nI dont really know what to do?? Or who to go to or what I should do or if there is even a problem. I'm just some teenager who doesn't have a meal schedule. I don't think I have an eating disorder, and I don't want to \"diagnose\" myself. Because maybe I dont have one. And I'm being rude to people who actually have one. Like those people who say \"oh I'm so depressed\" when they really aren't. So I don't want to assume anything, I'm just kinda worried. ", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

Recently, I was watching some short documentaries about people with different abilities, people with different lifestyles, and so on. One of the documentaries was about feederism, a BDSM subculture where people get sexual gratification from feeding their significant other to the point of immobility. I have no interest in kinks or BDSM; I just watched it because it was on autoplay as the next brief documentary (probably around 10 minutes long).\n\nI can't say that I've ever felt very triggered up until that point. People who are unhealthily overweight have always somewhat bothered me unfortunately. I don't mean to come across as rude by any means, and I apologize profusely if I do. They trigger me in the same way that unhealthily underweight people do to others.\n\nThat short documentary was my tipping point. After I watched it, I felt like I was on the brink of a full blown panic attack any moment. I have never had a panic attack before, but based on how I felt I think I was about to have one and my symptoms matched what I found online when I researched panic attacks. I'm not trying to self diagnose myself by any means, but it's just a *guess* of what happened. I was sweaty, couldn't stop shaking, and cried for who knows how long.\n\nI don't know why I got so triggered from just a documentary. I feel horrible for saying all of this because I never like it when someone body shames someone else. It's rude and inconsiderate, but now I feel so awful that it's triggering to see someone else who is more overweight than they should be.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? I just feel like I'm the only one who thinks this, especially when my post request got rejected from r/eatingdisorders when I've seen posts about the opposite end of the spectrum, where people feel triggered from seeing people who are unhealthily underweight.\n\nThank you for listening &lt;3\n\nEdit: I don't know if this is important to know, but I'm not overweight and I never have been.

I had a solid handle on my eating and exercise habits. I was losing fat, gaining muscle, and slimming down. My goal was long term health, not weight or appearance. My body and mind felt healthy and good. I eventually hit a plateau and began investing too much stock in the opinions of others. I let weights and measures become my focus and my relationship with my body started to falter. \n\n\nAbout 18 months ago, on what I now consider my obsessive quest to be \"totally fixed,\" I uncovered the root of my earliest traumas and it fucked me up HARD. It didn't undo what I had accomplished over 6 years of treatment. I still have a more neutral-to-positive sense of self, much less self-disgust, and, more often than not, the ability to stay out of of feeling like a victim of my life. Even so, the invasive thoughts of my earliest traumas were nearly ever present and I fell back on my oldest and \"best\" intervention: the mind-numbing binge session. \n\n\nAs any addict in relapse would, I told myself it wasn't going to be a problem. I allowed myself \"grace\" while I worked through the rough patch. I continued to eat healthy most of the time, and made my best efforts to stay active. Fitness habits soon fell off the map, shortly followed by any attempt to prioritize a healthy balanced diet. Fat gain resumed, my mood and energy continued to plummet and I feel like I've gotten stuck inside an incredibly vicious cycle of binge-guilt-fat gain-guilt. I can't stay on the wagon for more than a few weeks and I hate myself a little bit more every single time I can't break through this relapse.\n\n\nI can't afford to go back into treatment and I don't have a good support network behind me. Probably the main catalyst of this relapse was becoming estranged from the two people I considered my very best friends. I'm not angry about losing them, as they are both addicts and my relationships with both of them were codependent and toxic. Regardless, they at least meant I had SOMEONE to be around. I tried re-engaging in weight loss and fitness communities but my body image triggers all stem from things like fitspo/thinspo and neurotic tracking of weight and size. So that did more harm than good, I think.\n\n\nI need help and support to stay positive and focused on the horizon. I want to find like minded persons who also have the goal of making and keeping healthy balanced habits for the sheer goal of being able to have healthy vital organs and joints, healthy skin and hair, good sleep and clear thoughts. I know this eating disorder and I understand addiction well. I know I can never cure it and that's okay. But I do know I can engage in recovery again and I want to so very badly. \n\nTl;Dr: I was on the wagon for a good few years. I fell off and I'm fucking stuck. I need help getting and staying back on, from people who share a similar mindset of positivity and growth.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I'm finding it hard now, outside of the hospital and PHP settings, to get myself to have it everyday. For me, it helps if I plan to meet with someone for lunch beforehand.

This feeling has been with me for 15+ years. It\u2019s been there since I realized that thinner girls who knew how to dress their bodies in flattering ways were connecting easily with guys I liked. It\u2019s been there since someone I thought was cute verbalized to my face how he thought I was unattractive. It was easy to hate other women when I pretended I was somehow better than them because I did well academically, or musically, or whatever dumb internalized misogynist garbage I told myself. I hated them and I hated me. As I got older, I noticed women who were not thinner than me, some who were and are great people, also landing guys I liked. The fear morphed\u2026 not only is my body not good enough, but maybe who I am at my core is not good enough for the kind of person I want.\u00a0So maybe making my body smaller would make who I am a little less unacceptable. \n\nWeight loss has never really been about\u00a0\u201cbeing healthier.\u201d It has always been about how I may be perceived by men. I go to the gym (out of enjoyment!) more than anyone I know and have made a hobby of powerlifting. I am blessed to be a generally healthy and active human, albeit lumpy in places. I like doughnuts and grapes and broccoli and cheese and bacon and asparagus and apples and chocolate and avocado toast. I eat all of these things with joy and I know what a balanced diet looks like.\u00a0My body is average sized and, really, fine. This thing isn\u2019t about health and never has been. \n\nThe real issue here is not feeling fulfilled romantically, and pinning my lack of romantic success on low hanging fruit (my body habitus). It\u2019s not as if I\u2019ve never had a relationship... I\u2019m in medical school now, but back when I was going down a very different career path, romance came much more easily. The reality is I\u2019m finally somewhat confident in myself, finally not hating other women due to my own gross relationship envy, but I\u2019m not in places where I regularly run into people with whom I\u2019m actually compatible... so I hate myself and my body in the meantime, as if that will change things. I have perpetuated my binging for years, a reaction to this particular type of loneliness, a desperate reach for a specific form of comfort in an admittedly comfortable life, a poor substitute for something real that I wish I could find, but can\u2019t. \n\nToday, I wrote this down and fully realized, somewhat shamefully, where this has all been coming from. God damn. \n\nTL;DR: I binge because I restrict, and I restrict because I want my body to be acceptable for the kind of romantic love I want, but then I binge when I feel too deprived, and fleetingly feel comfortable in a way I think love might feel. Really, it\u2019s just a matter of life circumstances. I\u2019m healthy, and I\u2019m so fortunate in every way. \n\nWhy should I pour any more energy into hating my amazing body or mind for reasons that aren\u2019t based in reality? \n\n\n\nToday, I didn\u2019t binge.

I Developed an eating disorder when I was 12 (now f23) and have been suffering since. about 2 years ago I stopped my excessive exercising, and tried to gain control of my eating disorder. I began to open up to a friend about this. She tried to get me to talk to a dr, but I was to scared to fully get help I guess? Shortly after I got pregnant. I knew I had to be healthy for my baby and told my midwife my history. She was happy I was open with her but nothing really came of it. I made sure I ate, but overall pregnancy was mentally very hard on me. I hated my body and my monthly/weekly checkups to see how much I gained. Over all meeting my baby girl made it all worth it. Now almost a year later I still feel kind of stuck. I'm breastfeeding mostly because of the health benefits for my daughter.

I've been tempted the yesterday and today to sleep, and avoid eating anymore today. I already am staying within the limits of a caloric intake to lose weight over an eight year period, but am so afraid of coming close or going over that I've been restricting. I seem to be unable to log my eating habits or exercise without my OCD and ED being triggered. It's tormenting, needing to eat to live and not being able to starve myself because of the health consequences. If I could ingest a pill that contained all my daily nutritional needs and did away with cravings, I would feel such relief and freedom. I'm sick of feeling trapped.\n\nTightening my shirt around my waist after I eat to see how it looks, being hyper aware of how my clothes fit each day and constantly touching my stomach and measuring the inches with my fingers (and doing the same to see how much there is to lose. Where my waist could be. Where it is supposed to be. Feeling my hip bone and following the line up to my ribs and imagining where the fat wouldn't be). I can't enjoy anything I put in my mouth, I'm already adding the calories to my count for that day and even thinking of the food in numbers (from seeing it in the bowl and on the plate, to chewing and swallowing).\n\nI was going to start receiving services at Melrose Center but some seriously stressful life events happened. I did go to The Emily Program, but did not find my time there of much help. Food sometimes seems an antagonist. I have struggled with my weight from Middle school onward, and society has no issue making me aware. Of my supposed ugliness, laziness, worthlessness, poor character and total lack of any self-control.

That is what the cut looked like in my mind)\\*... That's how sad, unhappy and much I hated my body (maybe still do, but no visualization like that since).

To get my period back, I had to put on a bit of extra weight beyond my original, pre-anorexia weight.\n\nNow, I have gained about 20 pounds on top of that.

I don\u2019t go out with friends, and rarely even hang out with them because I am afraid they\u2019ll no longer see me as the beautiful girl I was once. \n\nEven when I had anorexia, people praised me on how gorgeous I was and urged me to look into modelling. I am very pretty when at a good weight, but I hate how I\u2019ve let myself go to the point of seemingly no return.\n\nEvery time I try to lose the weight, I end up saying, \u201cScrew it, I\u2019m ugly now anyway\u201d, and bingeing to numb my emotions. I feel lonely, I feel ugly, my acne is the worst it ever has been, and, as a college student, watching super skinny girls get dressed up in clingy mini dresses for nights on the town is devastating to someone who wears the same 5 flowy shirts on rotation and hopes no one notices.\n\nAfter recovery, I used to workout regularly and eat extremely healthfully (not in a restrictive way- I eat the healthy foods I love; might have been eating a bit too little but weight loss is a bitch). Now, I struggle to get dressed in workout clothes and show my round, fat face in the gym. \n\nGiving up and eating my emotions is just so much easier.

Over the past month I've been reflecting about how different my relationship with food has become and planning to reintroduce some sugar and flour to see what happens.

Bagels were one of my favorite binge foods, I could easily eat several in a sitting along with other foods. I remember a friend saying offhand once \"you can't have two bagels in a day\" as just a general food guideline that most people follow, and I remember feeling so embarrassed because I once ate a half dozen bagels one after the other.\n\nSo anyway, I ate the bagel and it was just...fine. I enjoyed it, I ate until I felt full, threw the last bit away, and went on with my day. I'm not feeling cravings now, I'm happy to eat my veggie heavy dinner that I planned tonight. \n\nI'm so relieved and hopeful! I plan to keep on mostly following bright line eating because I feel really good physically eating this way, but I feel like I can have some more flexibility with my eating without going off the deep end and getting caught in the binge cycle again. I'm so glad I tried this eating plan because it was the thing I needed to finally stop binging.

I used to have bulimia (throwing up, laxatives, over exercising, starving, binging...) and struggled with it for years.

She goes thru phases when she pushes me away, blocking me everywhere and going back in contact after some time (days, weeks or even months) like nothing happens. I know that me just being there for her like that isn't enough (I've been told that, that she doesn't even need me) but have no idea what else to do. When I'm supposed to come and see her, she just cancels it. I know how hard the struggle is, but I don't want to see her not getting any help. Because most of the time, she seems like she doesn't even want any help (which I understand, been there). She says that no one is able to understand her, that I can have no idea how she feels. She says that she doesn't trust anyone and once said that because I don't understand her problem, there is no need to be in touch with me. And I know that I can't possibly know everything, but I think that after struggling with the same shit, I can at least relate a little bit.

AHHHH. \n\nI don\u2019t even wanna blame her cause if I was skinny she wouldn\u2019t say that.

Then I went to a bakery and downed a deep fried donut + a milk stick + 85% of a huge cinnamon roll. Told myself I\u2019d stop there. Then I got bread pudding and ate half of it.

So I'm trying to find advice on how to control my eating the old-fashioned way: Google.\n\nI really think the people who compile these \"helpful\" articles and lists don't actually understand the difference between compulsive overeating and just needing to diet.\n\n\"Replace the cookie jar with a fruit bowl.\"  \"Portion out snacks ahead of time.\"  \"Drink more water.\"  \"Eat mindfully.\"\n\nIt doesn't matter if you portion out snacks into serving sizes if you can't stop yourself from eating ten of them if you try to have just one.  Yeah, I might be less hungry if I drink water all day long (which I already do but let's assume I'll be hungrier if I don't), but how hungry I am doesn't fucking matter, because I DON'T STOP EATING WHEN I STOP BEING HUNGRY.\n\nI'm so sick of the condescending \"oh you just need to make healthier choices\" bullshit.  The only choices I'm able to make are \"You can eat literally nothing\" or \"You will eat the entire house in one sitting.\"  That's it.  Those are my options.  I don't know why I'm like this.  I'd love to know.  \"Make a schedule and stick to it\" like if I make a schedule and don't put \"ingest 3000 calories of crap at 3am\" on it, I won't do it.  Using smaller dishes and utensils is just going to slow me down slightly; I'll still eat the exact same amount.  \n\nThings were fine for me for a while - I was eating like a normal person, really no sweets or crap food, nor did I WANT them.  Which is why I genuinely wanted to punch my girlfriend in the face for smugly saying \"See, this is what happens when you deprive yourself of food you like.\"  She was jealous I lost so much weight.  I'm still salty about that one.  But I didn't feel deprived.  I DIDN'T WANT THEM.\n\nBut then my mother got sick and I stopped caring about anything else.  I started wanting horrible foods in huge amounts again and didn't care enough to try and find a way to stop it.  She's fine now, has been for a year and a half, but my motivation remains completely gone.  I just can't make myself care enough about how I look or about my health.  I've had to give up nearly everything else in life I enjoy.  Why do I have to give this up, too?  Which seems like a trick question, because while I'm doing it I sure as fuck don't enjoy it.  But whenever I'm not eating, it's the only thing I want to be doing.\n\nI'd love to read something about that - how to make yourself give a fuck when everything good in your life is going or gone.  It's my girlfriend's turn to be sick now (how many ovarian cancer scares can one family have?  This one better be another false alarm.) and I'm not dealing with it any better.  How to make yourself believe how much you know you actually hate bingeing.  How to enjoy doing literally anything.  How to do anything when you have the energy level of a slug at all times and agoraphobia just to keep things interesting.  How to wake up in the morning and feel any other way that isn't disappointed to still be alive.  How to deal with a psychiatrist who makes you feel like human garbage, who doesn't know what executive dysfunction is/believe it's a thing, who thinks that being able to do something for short periods of time means you're able to do it constantly and indefinitely, who thinks that my being actively suicidal at all times is a fair trade for my having a job.  How to feel anything at all that's even vaguely positive without the aid of a dozen cupcakes (at least until the shame kicks in within a few seconds). \n\nBut sure \"lol just don't buy oreos you dumb fatty\" is perfectly helpful too.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I wont be aiming for *any* weight loss, although I would love my body to get fitter again whatever else that brings. It just made me so happy and forget my worries. I felt so free, and loved feeling fast. I loved loved loved being able to enter events, the atmosphere, and get medals too. I love shiny medals! :) Pretty :)\n\nI went for a hilly 5k tonight with a friend, we were chatting along, 14 min miles. I didn't know it was possible to go so slow whilst still feeling like you were somewhat struggling/running... I just want to feel more capable, and fast again.\n\nI'm happy to set a limit. i.e, 10min miles fastest, 10k distance tops, 3x week max. A lifetime limit if needs be. But I really want to feel somewhat capable again :( But be safe about it.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice or experience? Of how to get back to being better at it, or whether I even should? I was never terribly underweight, if it makes a difference. Developed ED in 2015. Started recovery last April (2018), weight stable by end of September.

I have gotten to a place where I can eat a variety of foods and I have even attempted to stop tracking my intake over the last week. My issue is that, without tracking my intake, I am paralyzed that I am eating way more than I was before. Using an app, I was able to maintain a pretty standard intake for a person of my size. Sometimes I did feel it wasn't quite enough; I was really hungry a lot, even though I was maintaining my weight. Now that I'm not tracking, I know I have to be eating more than I was before. I am nervous that I am going to gain weight, even though I'm trying to be very mindful of what I eat. I am trying to exercise and eat healthy foods. My worry is, why am I so hungry? I seem to have this huge appetite and I fear that, since I was maintaining weight on what I was eating before, won't I gain a ton just eating \"intuitively\"? I have been doing it for the past five days and haven't gained any weight yet, so this might be silly. But why is it that my appetite is so big?

I had a doctor's appointment this week and my doctor told me I really need to make an effort to gain some weight back which I expected her to say. It's hard to hear, but necessary to heal. She also asked me to slow way down on exercise until I do.\n\nNow for a few weeks I have been having a struggle with cooking meals. I usually love to cook, but lately I loathe it. I have a family (husband and kid) so I prepare meals for all of us. It's been so difficult that last night I actually cried while cooking and by the time I was done, I was so frustrated with the entire thing that I didn't want to eat.\n\nI really just want to get take out every day because this is so crappy for me right now but that's not an option. 1. it's too expensive and 2. too much take out makes my body feel bad (it makes my migraines/endometriosis flare, which is painful and debilitating). My husband tries to help but him cooking actually just makes everything so much worse because he asks me constantly \"what do you want\" or asks me repeatedly how to make something. I've nicely expressed to him that doing that is worse than me just cooking but he hasn't been able to temper it. It's a learning curve, this issue is new for both of us.\n\nAnyone experience this? What solutions did you come up with? It's really hard because I prepare so much food for my family and my kiddo isn't at the age where she can do this herself yet. Meal prepping and freezer meals are not much of a solution because I don't really like leftover/reheated foods and forcing myself to eat something I don't like in the name of convenience isn't going to help (basically, any barriers to eating are going to keep me from eating). Same with TV/packaged dinners. I loathe them. When I went to residential treatment a decade ago that's all we ate and now I can't even stand the smell of them. This is so hard.

So I'm hoping to touch on a few things that have allowed me to avoid some of the classic purging symptoms.\n\n1. **Moisturize after purging.** When you purge, your body naturally creates a lot of excess saliva to coat your mouth. It also tends to get everywhere. When it dries, it also leaches moisture off your chin/hands/arms/anywhere else it somehow ends up. I always use a basic facial moisturizer on my lower face area after a purge. I think this is what has allowed me to avoid developing any acne on my chin. \n2. **Chapstick.** This is in the same spirit as moisturizing. Purging dries out my lips a lot, so I apply some kind of lip balm liberally after each session so my lips don't split. So far it's been working for me. I also like to use lip balm on my knuckles, the tube shape makes it easier to apply accurately.\n3. **Contour.** I use this to hide the classic frog-face that happens when the saliva glands under the chin swell. Take a medium-sized fluffy brush and use a shade slightly darker than your skintone to contour along the shadow of your jawline. I just use an eyeshadow and it works fine.\n\nI haven't ever seen anything like this posted, so hopefully this will be helpful to some people.

For example I kept this creepy excel spreadsheet of my weight every day and would fit lines to see how much i lost a day, super weird to look back at.   \nI always figured I'd just go my whole life without ever knowing my weight unless I was in relapse, because I put judgement on every number I saw on the scale. Problem with that was, inevitably I'd fall into the temptation of stepping on the scale and I'd be shocked by the number because I hadn't weighed myself since my last relapse.   \n\n\nCue recovery round 4 *(this time is for real lol)*, I couldn't knock the obsessive weighing even after I began eating unrestricted and purposely gaining weight. I'd never really watched the number on the scale go up before, but oddly enough I found it somewhat helpful. Tabitha Farrar mentioned when she was in the weight gain phase of recovery that she actually enjoyed seeing her weight go up because it meant she was doing the hard work she needed to do. That was such a foreign concept, seeing your weight go up and not hate yourself for it.   \n\n\nSo since I couldn't stop giving into the temptation of weighing(I did toss my home scale but my stupid work has a locker room with a scale), I decided to \"fake it til i make it\" as far as celebrating when my weight went up. Completely foreign to me, but it is sort of working? I started recovery not technically underweight this round, but at a bad weight for my body/age, now I weigh more than before I relapsed and probably more than I've weighed in my whole life.  \n\n\nAnd I'm pretty okay with it!  Which is a miracle. I thought my body pre-relapse was disgusting and I was at a lower weight than I am now. I do a lot of \"Fake it til you make it\" with body image now and that has built my confidence a lot, I am only allowed to think or say nice things about myself and my body. I have no intention of purposely ceasing weight gain, so part of me is worried I will gain to the point where the number has an emotional effect on me again. I want to believe I would accept myself at any weight and that I will be able to resist putting a judgement on it, but I'm not sure that will be the case as I continue to see the number climb up  \n\n\n  \n**TLDR**: This is really long-winded, but I wanted other people's inputs on weighing yourself in recovery. Generally speaking, I think knowing your own weight in recovery is more damaging than it is helpful. I want to get to the point where the number on the scale doesn't mean anything to me nor does it interest me, and I think weighing myself is desensitizing me, but maybe also my eating disorder is trying to tell me that so I'll keep using it as a behavior?  \n\n\nDo you prefer to never know your weight? Did you weigh yourself in recovery? Have you ditched the scale entirely? ", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I don\u2019t really know if I consider myself to have a real ED but I know my eating habits have always been unhealthy - use to be overweight/obese then went down to bottom of healthy bmi and then settled a few pounds higher.\n\nOver Christmas this year I became very unwell with a viral infection and spent a week in hospital and a further 8 weeks off work. In hospital I ate barely anything because I was so unwell. I was also weighed every day by a nurse (almost everyone in my bay would be weighed also). I don\u2019t know if this is relevant but feels worth mentioning, one day a nurse around the same age as me, weighed me and then weighed herself and I believed at the time she was comparing her weight to mine and really wanted to know what she weighed but didn\u2019t ask, I still wish I did for some reason?\n\nAnyway I don\u2019t know but I feel like this triggered something in me and since I got out of hospital I\u2019ve been eating 1 small \u201cmeal\u201d a day and counting calories constantly, even counting calories of hypothetical meals that I know I\u2019ll never eat.\n\nI just had this idea in my head that I really wanted to be a certain weight or lower before I went back to work and when I returned to work I was that weight exactly.\n\nPeople at work have commented on it, in a sympathetic \u201cwow you must have been so unwell\u201d sort of way, little do they know I chose to do this to myself after I got out of hospital. I didn\u2019t think I was doing it for people at work, I mean I obviously want people to see me as thin but I\u2019m almost ashamed to admit I feel like disappointed? that people haven\u2019t noticed or commented on it more, I feel stupid and self centred for even saying that.\n\nAt the same time, when I was off another woman I work with lost weight and colleagues have told me she\u2019s been speaking very openly about restricting her diet to x (small) amount of calories daily and exercising at least once a day. And I don\u2019t know, honestly I think I might be jealous of her? Even though I know I weigh a good bit less than her, people seem to be talking about her and her weight loss constantly and expressing concern amongst themselves that she may have an ED.\n\nThanks for reading all of this if you\u2019ve got this far, I\u2019m not even sure what I\u2019m asking for but I just feel like my thinking is really fucked up these past couple of months and i had planned to stop losing and just maintain my weight when I got back to work but really it\u2019s just getting worse. Like I said, I\u2019ve always had unhealthy eating habits but never anything like this before, it\u2019s taking up so much of my headspace and I\u2019m focusing on my weight, this woman\u2019s weight, calorie counting and what people at work think constantly, it just feels really fucked up and it\u2019s not like me.

(yeah i didnt mean for it to be this long. feel free to go on but the purpose of this was honestly just to straighten out my own thoughts) Im just so fed up with my mom\u2019s comments. Like i\u2019m not blaming her for my issues with food but she has definitely enhanced it. Being raised, food was always a reward. Getting up early for school = donuts, good grades = pizza, etc. She always bought junk food so poptarts or mcdonalds for breakfast, little debbie treats every day in my lunch, some fast food or frozen pizza for dinner. Fast foward to 4th grade when i was \u201calmost overweight\u201d according to my mom (who, along with my dad, is clinically obese). This is when my mom payed for a personal trainer (which we could not afford) to help us lose weight. It was so embarrassing having to step on the scale and see I was just over 100lbs (which for a 4th grader is totally reasonable?) then have my \u201cfat\u201d squeezed and measured. We only went for a month until it got too expensive, but i was relieved. 3rd-5th grade I also ran for my school so practice on top of this was a lot. Fast foward to 5th grade when my mom put me in a \u201chealthy eating for kids\u201d class, essentially a diet class for fat kids. All other kids in the class with me were very overweight or obese, so I obviously thought I was the same. Looking back now, I was very average for my age, barely even having any chub. Ive also since realized that my mom putting me in that class did literally nothing, as I was a helpless child who relied on my mom to buy me food, so why teach me about salad when you\u2019re still going to order pizza for dinner? It was from 4th grade on that I bagan sucking my stomach in often, so much that by 5th grade it was habit and I could easily do it all day without any trouble. Always had low self esteem and ya know all that comes with it. (TW) 6th grade(150lbs) I started self harming and throwing my food away at lunch. That summer I threw away the food my mom would leave in the fridge for me while she was at work, and would only eat the dinner she prepared. I lost about 15 pounds that summer probably? Then I discovered counting calories. By freshman year i was vegan and almost back to my 4th grade weight, eating 200 calories a day with no suspicion from my mom. People were starting to worry and ask my mom if i was okay, and she said that i had just grown out of my chubby phase. Once she realized uhh oh wait, the only thing youve eaten today is a bowl of watermelon, I was yelled at and interrogated. This lead to many many lies and hiding of food and crying in the shower etc etc. This threw me into a whirlwind of binge eating as i was afraid of being sent into treatment. Im a senior now (150lbs fml) and the comments from my mother have increased greatly. \u201cyou need to start going to the gym again\u201d \u201cdont you miss when you were a little thinner\u201d i had some cereal the other day (all id eaten) and i mentioned that night my stomach hurt. \u201cprobably because youve been eating so much junk\u201d my mom says as she eats chips with an inch of cheese on top at 1am. Ive been so fed up with it recently and havent been afraid to speak up. we\u2019ve gotten into many arguments after i tell her that she hurt my feelings by saying that but \u201cim the one that was being rude\u201d. my mom says i need to stop drinking 0 cal energy drinks bcs the fake sugar is bad for me, i tell her she needs to stop getting a large iced frappe from mcdonalds every day after work. etc etc. A few months ago when she mentioned how id gained quite a bit of weight, i replied with \u201cyeah because ive actually been eating\u201d of course this lead to many questions and i said \u201cwell i only lost the weight by eating 200 calories a day\u201d she said nothing after that, i went to my room, and its never been spoken of again. she still makes these comments to me, saying shes only trying to look out for me so i dont get to looking how she does. i tell her that ive always been conscious of my eating and from a young age ive loved fruits and veggies, my one fear was looking like her. I just dont know what do anymore. ive tried everything i can. ive thought about writing her a letter because im too scared to say it to her face, but i know she would want to talk about and i dont want her to find out a lot of the stuff ive done and still do.

And fucking hell it was freeing, I felt so smug about telling anorexia to fuck right off. \n\nSlept the entire next day, literal food coma.

Dealing with bloating etc, but trying not to feel guilty (lorazepam and promethazine help a lot..) As everyone was encouraging me to listen to my body.

But I was actually looking forward to this weekend cause I was gonna go to London and fucking *eat!!*, since last time all I got to do was stare and salivate. I was *excited* to eat.\n\nThen, I saw my GP yesterday. She weighed me. 9kg up in 5 days. She knows my history of AN, since she sees me weekly for physical monitoring, and we were waiting for inpatient referrals. She spoke to an ED consultant who had seen me a few weeks ago. Said ED consultant called this \"just a binge\", said I needed to go to the hospital to be seen by a dietitian to get a \"less extreme\" food plan in place (long story as to why I don't have a meal plan or much help rn, hence the sorta.. Self attempted recovery situation, but obv my body did not care about refeeding syndrome, it just wanted food.. A lot of food. I know it was dangerous.

That's why most of my friends and my parents never noticed my eating disorder, but they do noticed Ive lost significant weight. Generally most Filipinos are generally thin in build where men are mostly slender and women are small and petite.\n\nDuring highschool, I was stick thin and I eat whatever I want and like. Eating has always been enjoyable and carefree. Now Im in my last years of college, stress and adulting is taking a toll on me. I started gaining weight, my face got bigger and soon became more insecure as I became aware of my looks. \n\nI was riding a jeepney home and I saw a beggar asking for coins and looking at him, all I can think about is how can I be as thin as him. I suffered anorexia and bulimia that slowly transformed into orthorexia with episodes of bulimia. Everytime I throw away food or purged them I feel really bad because millions of people around me are starving and here I am purging in the bathroom. I feel bad that I took my comfortable lifestyle for granted and made me feel worse because why am I suffering if I generally have all I need to live.\n\nSometimes I feel tired, like I want to be normal again. But again, having an ED is the only control I could ever have in my life for now. My parents had been very very emotionally manipulating and they are so intrusive and verbally abusive at times. I also suffered trauma from extreme physical punishments when I was a child since its stereotypical for asians to always have good grades and achievements in school. So here I am, pretending Im okay but I know Im not.

Although I was at a healthier weight, I continued to restrict myself and engage in disordered thinking about food, my body, my relationships with others, etc, just to a lesser extent than when I was anorexic. But this past summer, I went through something really difficult and began binge eating to cope (I was definitely already pre-disposed to emotional eating and black and white thinking). Fast forward almost eight months later and I\u2019ve developed full-on BED. However I\u2019m proud to say that I finally started therapy this past week (there\u2019s so much to work through but at least I started!) and I\u2019ve been binge-free since Friday. If I manage to make it through tonight (my cravings are always awful at night), I\u2019ll have reached a streak of 6 days binge-free, which is the longest I\u2019ve ever done since about August. I\u2019d say that what has helped me last this long was:\n\na) making hot, lightly sweet drinks to fill myself up and create warm fuzzy feelings at night\n \nb) inputting my calories for the day only if I felt that I had \u201ceaten too much\u201d at dinner, so that I could see that I\u2019d eaten a fairly normal amount of food and rationally talk myself out of a binge\n\nc) just going to sleep early and waking up early the next morning to complete my homework if I felt my urges were extra strong \n\nd) trying my hardest to follow my hunger/physical cues (lightheadedness, tiredness) and eat when my body was physically hungry during the day when my willpower is at its strongest. this helps me be determined to not binge at night.\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019m anxious every day that today I\u2019ll fuck up and break the streak and have no idea how long this will last. I guess I just wanted to try to give u guys some hope that someone with extremely disordered thinking patterns, who hasn\u2019t gone more than 2-3 days without bingeing in the past several months was able to treat herself properly for a couple of days.

(X-post)", "author": "Rumskie", "self_text": "Hey guys!I just wanted to share my success for the past week  and, actually, past few months!\n\nFirst off: What i\u2019m super proud of:\n\nBefore: [https://imgur.com/gallery/OAX5dN6](https://imgur.com/gallery/OAX5dN6)\n\nAfter:\n\n[https://imgur.com/gallery/005qti5](https://imgur.com/gallery/005qti5)\n\n(I have my calories set to 1250 which is the bottom of my range so I know when I hit it. The red isn\u2019t a negative, it just lets me know I\u2019m getting close)\n\nI haven't binged in 75 days, and this past week I stayed right within my calorie goals!! I have a range of up to 1450ish calories, and I only barely went over that once and I still lost weight so it's fine :).  I actually lost a lot of weight because I\u2019m a fairly active person, but my once a week 2K calorie binges on top of w/e food I ate was stalling my progress big time and basically putting me at a maintenance/over enough to gain 1-2 lbs and was very frustrating. I\u2019ve lost 5 lbs since I stopped binging :)\n\nI\u2019ve had a problem with binge eating for like. At least a year, if not more. It was usually later at night, after I\u2019d hit my calorie max, and for whatever reason I would just uncontrollably eat and eat and eat. I realized I had a problem but couldn\u2019t stop for the longest time.\n\nHere\u2019s what I did to stop binging (and while it is still a possibility that I will binge in the future, I know to forgive myself and move on to the next day like nothing happened )\n\n1. Started counselling:\n   1. I haven\u2019t been going for the past month, but I went to counselling for a while and just being able to tell someone about my binging helped a lot because it made it not so shameful and secretive. I told a couple of close friends as well, and we actually got into a conversation about our eating disorders which actually really helped me because I didn\u2019t feel so isolated/shameful\n2. I stopped counting calories and trying to actively lose weight.\n   1. Temporarily, while I learned to not binge. I think the combination of trying to track calories and not binge and the same time was way too much for me to deal with, so i stopped tracking calories for about 2 months while I relearned to eat. This took a lot of pressure off of food and me, as I wasn\u2019t focused on the numbers and was able to focus on how I felt and whatnot. This part was extremely hard for me because I\u2019ve been counting calories for years and I was terrified that I was gonna gain a lot of weight. There were a few binge sessions during this time, but it was part of the learning process.\n   2. What actually led into this was not a conscious decision. During winter break I travelled a lot and did not really have access to being able to binge all the time, which broke the cyclical habit. I went on a snowboarding trip, and then visited various family members in 2 different states. I was not able to weigh my food, myself, or really track my calories other than guessing. I took this opportunity to learn how to overeat but NOT binge, which I feel is actually very important. Just because I go over my calorie goal but 2-300 does not mean I need to eat another 1000 calories because I \u201cfailed\u201d that day. So for a month I learned to not binge but eat freely and while I definitely overate, I never went into that uncontrollable stuffing my face with whatever food I could reach mode.\n3. I started listening to this amazing podcast: The Beauty Coach Podcast. Honestly, this helped my so much in changing my mentality and thinking more positively about myself. I highly highly recommended this to everyone; it\u2019s very female focused, but I believe other genders can get just as much out of this, just replace \u201cwomen\u201d with whatever you identify with when she is talking\n4. Came back to school, started counting calories again\n5. However, this time instead of a STRICT 1250 calories I gave myself a range of up to 1450-1500. I try to hit 1250-1350, but sometimes I want to eat more and that is fine. I also think I was restricting too much before at 1250 which led to my weekly binges. At 1250 I wasn\u2019t losing weight because I kept binging; at 1350-1500 I have lost 5 lbs because it is sustainable. Upping my calories was a little nerve wracking at first, but I watched my weight for a week and saw results so now i\u2019m fine with it\n6. I stopped weighing myself everyday (temporarily).\n7. I realized I would weigh myself almost to punish myself if I overate. I\u2019d binge one day and then weigh myself the next day to see how much \u201cweight\u201d i gained, and then watch it go down every day right back to where I started. I would bounce between 151.0 and 158 depending on how much I binged, but It would never fall below that and it was so very disheartening.(I\u2019m finally in the 140 range after struggling for over a year with this!!)\n8. I also have a day counter to track how many days.\n\nI have one tracker for how many days since I binged (75!), and how many days since I actively started trying to lose weight again ( 16!)\n\n1. I also started working out when I\u2019m stressed instead of eating. I\u2019ll do 5-10 minutes of core, some pushups, etc. instead of reaching for some snacks when I\u2019m feeling anxious. This has helped a lot for multiple reasons: I\u2019m working out more regularly which released good chemicals in the brain, it\u2019s a much better coping mechanism, and I\u2019m getting stronger because of it. Plus hopefully I\u2019ll get a rockin\u2019 core cause of it, cause I\u2019m very stressed with school rn ;P\n\nThis got a lot longer than I thought it would be but I\u2019m just super excited about my progress and felt like it might help others :)", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I was hoping I could get some advice or words of comfort or just hear if anyone else feels the same way I do now. It would really help me out.\n\nMy birthday is next week and I'm really freaking out. The last few years I've been in school and my bday has fallen during spring break, which was good and bad for me. Bad because I wasn't around my friends, so my bday has always felt a little lonely. But good for me and my ED because I haven't had to avoid eating cake/dinner/drinks around my friends. Instead I've managed to get by with a low key dinner (carefully pre-planned with minimal caloric intake of course) with my family and a small half-eaten slice of cake, which is about all my disordered mind can handle.\n\nBUT. This year is different. Now I'm out in the adult world working. I was really hoping I could sneak my bday by my coworkers, but I've already caught wind that they're planning a bunch of bday celebrations for me.\n\nFirst one of my female coworkers came into my office yesterday and told me she and the other girls had been chatting about taking me out for happy hour/dinner after work on my bday. I freaked out and told her I already had dinner plans (not a lie. Going with my fam). I hoped that would be the end of it, but she insisted we had to do something so she said we could do it on the weekend instead. I felt like I couldn't just say no so I pretended that I just wanted to get drinks next weekend so I could avoid any big food celebrations.\n\nTHEN today my immediate office co-workers were asking me questions about my favorite flavor of cake and where they should take me for lunch on my bday. I honestly almost went into a full-on panic attack. I tried telling them that I hate attention (true) and birthdays (also true) and that I'd rather not make a big deal of it. Didn't work. I told them that my parents were already giving me a cake. That didn't work either. Literally nothing I said mattered. \n\nOnce I realized that I'm getting a cake whether I want it or not, I furiously researched what I *thought* might be the lowest calorie cake (vanilla) and told them to just get me that so they wouldn't surprise me with some obscenely caloric double chocolate cake or something. \n\nI also lied and told them I already had lunch plans with a friend, but their response was that I had to pick some other day for them to take me out to lunch then. Idk how pushy they're going to be about this. I'm hoping that maybe if I avoid giving them a make-up date they'll just forget about it. \n\nANYWAYS. Long story short, I'm sitting at work now unable to think about anything other than the fact I'm going to be forced to eat cake and got out on all these dinner/lunch/drink \"treats\" for my bday, when really all I want to do is restrict like any other day. But I also feel so guilty because I know my family/coworkers are just trying to make my day special, and they don't realize that their good intentions are causing me this much anxiety. \n\nAny suggestions as to how I should react to the onslaught of birthday food gifts next week?? Anyone else out there dread their bday for this reason?? I just hate that it seems like you can't have a bday without a massive amount of sugary sweets and other fatty foods ugh.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}
