I love my family, but I just don\u2019t feel like I belong here anymore. I went out of state for college and since then (4 years ago) am only home for a couple weeks at a time. I also was at my very lowest, darkest place of my anorexia during high school, so I think being here brings up some of those memories as well which is why it\u2019s so difficult. \n\nI just wish that I felt at home here. I wish that I wanted to come back. I\u2019m jealous of people I knew in high school who went to college together and came back here together. Because of that, I have to try so hard to be social. Sometimes I just don\u2019t feel like having to force my way in. I miss having my main friend group like I do at college. I don\u2019t have a set group here, just scattered friendships. They all have their own close groups though, so I feel like I have to invite myself and try so hard to be included. I\u2019m not used to that.\n\nI\u2019m a huge extrovert, so without near-constant social interaction I literally cannot function. I get very depressed feeling and don\u2019t want to get out of bed or be awake. That feeling also brings me back to the depths of my darkest days with my ED, which is insanely triggering and upsetting that I used to feel like this for months on end. \n\nIs this just part of growing up? Do lots of people feel like this when they\u2019re in between stages of life? On the outside looking in it seems like everyone loves being home. I love being with my family and I feel like I\u2019m letting them down that I don\u2019t feel like I belong here. I know they want me to move back here someday but I just can\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019m terrified about having to be here for a full month over Christmas. How can I break the cycle and not let myself slip into a depression again? I feel so guilty for being like this because I love my parents so much and I know it worries them to see me like this. It worries me too.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I worked 8 hours on Thanksgiving and missed dinner with my family, but they graciously saved me some ham, turkey, and rolls. I went a little wild on the ham and turkey when I got off around 9 PM. I didn't work black Friday so I stayed up real late watching movies with my long distance boyfriend. Fast forward to 4am (Friday morning) and I'm nauseous and feeling stomach pains. I think \"oh, I just ate too much.\" But it progresses to an agonizing pain in my back as well, and I start puking quite a bit. I suspect gallbladder issues, which my boyfriend has also been having so I thought I'm just passing a stone maybe? It gets to 5:30 am and I decide to wake my Mom up to take me to the ER. It's pretty empty today so they get me in fast, hook an IV up and give me some anti-nausea and pain medication. It takes the edge off and I'm able to think again. They did some blood tests, urine tests, and an ultrasound. Bingo, it's a gallstone stuck in a bile duct. They give me some prescriptions to control nausea and pain at home and refer me to a general surgeon. I call to leave a voicemail cause they're out for the holidays. Throughout the day the pain keeps coming back so I go back to the ER. They hook me up again, give me some pain meds, and eventually send me to inpatient upstairs until the surgeon can come back in and remove the offending gallbladder. I got through the surgery ok and I'm out of work for a little while. Now I can't eat spicy food, fried food, fatty stuff. Being female, overweight, having a genetic predisposition all worked against me, but I definitely have not been eating the best to take care of myself and the binging has caused harm to my body. Just thought I would share my experience with this disorder. It's worth it to consciously work on your relationship with food to avoid the possibility of agonizing pain.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I then did the big reveal about my eating and we had a talk about it. The only things I didn\u2019t tell her were about my suicidal thoughts (and attempt last September) and self harm, as well as saying I only have purged \u201conce or twice in the summer,\u201d even though it\u2019s been much more.

That can happen after I finish finals. \n\nIdk man, I\u2019m just tired. It might end up triggering me to restrict since I\u2019m terrified of gaining but if I can just get through these next few weeks then I\u2019ll be good. I can do it (I think). No scale, just doing the best I can to feed myself and not spiral due to stress. Then I can get back to self destruction after I have less academic responsibilities.\n\nWish me luck dudes \u270c\ufe0f", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Just stop right now.\n\nTaking laxatives may be satisfying because it feels like you're getting rid of what you've eaten, especially if you just overate/binged. But the truth is (as I'm sure many of you know), that's not what's REALLY happening, and that good feeling is just temporary. The more laxatives you take, the more you WILL become dependent upon it, I guarantee it. That's what happened to me when I started taking laxatives once every week. Before I knew it, I was taking them once every 2-3 days, and the amount I took rapidly increased. At my worst, I was taking at least 8 pills in one go (which is not recommended AT ALL). \n\nEverything changed though one day when I imagined my intestines being permanently damaged so that I could no longer go to the toilet naturally. I suddenly got really scared, and so I decided to quit cold turkey. For the next month, I struggled a lot both physically and mentally. I could feel all the food piling up inside me but I simply could not go to the toilet. There were many times when I wanted to give up and go back to taking laxatives, and on extremely bad days, I just wished I was no longer alive. \n\nThankfully I managed to push through, and after a full month (literally) of not going to the toilet, I finally managed to go naturally! Of course the amount was really little at first, but I've gone increasingly frequently ever since that first time and the amount has increased each time. I honestly could never have imagined this scenario happening several months ago. \n\nAll I can say now is, I am so glad that I decided to stop taking laxatives. It is honestly one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life, and I'm sure it will be the same for those of you out there overusing laxatives. So please, PLEASE just stop, for your sake.

I was weighing in at 165lbs at the beginning of 2019. I attributed my binge eating as a coping mechanism to stress of college (2016-2019). I graduated in May and I noticed I was still binge eating which was weird because I thought it would go away since I no longer needed a coping mechanism for stress. I started a new job in June, but my job is not stressful at all. I receive all the help I need on tasks and my job is very repetitive with a few challenges here and there. So now I can't blame my job for binge eating... After the long work week, I would go to Chipotle and order a bowl with a tortilla on the side. I will not go into specifics of my order but it's basically, beans, rice, chicken and ALL of the sides including guac. I easily would nuke this bowl in 10 minutes, but this would leave me in excruciating pain for an hour. Cramping, wanting to puke, and sometimes crying. Guilt is always there. I didn't know why I did this to myself, but I continued to do this EVERY WEEK. My \"trigger\" restaurants are Chipotle, Noodles and Company, and Panda Express. Then, Saturdays came around. I see my boyfriend every Saturday and we always go out to dinner. We get an appetizer and an entree. I don't eat as fast when I eat around my boyfriend because we usually talk, but I still binge eat in front of him. I finish my entire plate while he takes leftovers home. He's very familiar with me eating large portions and he didn't see anything wrong with it, not until I started opening up to him with all my feelings that surround eating large portions. He didn't know that binge eating was a disorder and frankly neither did I. I thought I just liked eating so much. I thought I had a positive relationship with food because I allowed myself to eat whatever, whenever, and however much. I basically binge eat 2-3x a week to the point my stomach feels swelled up, I feel like throwing up, and guilt and shame loom over me. I HATE IT. I've dealt with anxiety and very mild depression, but binge eating is far worse than my mental issues. Shits wack. It wasn't until October (2019) that I realized it's become a problem. What really opened my eyes was the fact that I was gaining weight even though I go to the gym 3x a week. I typically do 30mins of cardio (lose 300 calories) and 15mins of weight lifting. I do attribute some of my weight gain to my muscle mass but my belly is still huge and my back rolls are bigger, that's when I started to think \"what the fuck, why does my body still have fat?\" I tried to change my drinking habits (gave up beer and drank white claws and vodka), but nothing really changed. I finally admitted to myself that it was my binge eating habits. I plan on going to therapy for it but I don't know how successful this will be. I don't want bullshit advice like \"be mindful when eating.\" I literally do not feel in control when I binge eat. I hide when I binge eat, I watch TV/videos and scroll through apps when I binge eat, and I am in a comfortable setting when I binge eat. I think I would be successful in beating my disorder if there was someone next to me at all times monitoring me while I eat, telling me to stop eating, and someone to tell me No. Literally like a dog :( I don't know how to do this alone. I don't feel like I can do it alone. Has therapy worked for your binge eating disorder?", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

He wasn't hugely overweight to start with, probably only 30 pounds or so, but he has been losing weight very quickly. I always knew he hated his body but I didn't expect him to get so wrapped up in weight loss. \n\nWhen i was a teen (I'm 22 now) I had anorexia which turned into bulimia. I never got very skinny so it wasn't too noticeable to people around me, but it has messed me up mentally for a long time. I am uncomfortable with my body, I have a healthy bmi but I weigh more than i would like. He knows I used to have an eating disorder, but he doesn't know i still struggle with the thoughts. \n\nMy boyfriend's diet has him restricting to very few calories daily just like I used to do, and he plans out his tiny meals and cuts food into little pieces. He says that he actually \"doesn't need to eat\" because he is fat so his body lives off that. He started a new thing where he doesn't eat at all on weekends because he isn't doing work so doesn't need to eat apparently. He cut out so much food and now basically just eats chicken and broccoli. He weighs himself like 3 times a day and he is doing really well. I'm happy for him but jealous too, if I'm honest with myself. \n\nThere is so much more but basically, he just talks about calories and diets and body fat percentage all the time and it's making me feel extreme anxiety. \n\nDoes he think I'm fat and gross if I eat when he doesn't? Does he hate the fact that I'm not super skinny? Is he secretly disgusted by my high body fat? I have asked him all these things and he says of course not, but it's hard to believe. \n\nI don't think he has an eating disorder himself, I'm probably just reading too much into his behaviour and relating to it, but I am constantly triggered.  I imagine it will be worse when he gets skinnier than me which seems like it will happen. \n\nI don't want him to stop his diet if it's making him happy and I know my feelings are unfair on him, but I just get this sick feeling in my stomach when he talks about how few calories he ate that day or how much weight he lost that week. \n\nHow can I talk to him about this?", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

I (19F) have been wanting to get back a healthy relationship with food, and being able to eat intuitively would be a dream come true. But I don't know how to start, or if it would even work for me.\n\nSome context! I am not diagnosed with an ED, but for the past ~2 years I've been told by the therapist I used to see that I exhibit disordered eating patterns. I am still stuck in the cycle of restriction, bingeing (either actually or chew/spit), then compensating by overexercising, or just feeling guilty and depressed. I look healthy on the outside, but I'm now seeing symptoms that tell me I'm not healthy internally. So, I want to do something about this and stop obsessing over food 24/7 (which is freaking annoying)!!\n\nI found a bunch of IG accounts advertising for \"intuitive eating\" so I've been trying to follow their tips, first by stopping restriction. I think this was a mistake: e.g. I told myself I would \"eat intuitively\" this morning, then proceeded to put down a whole cake. I feel like crap. And I know I'm going to overeat later today too. So I plan on strictly dieting for the rest of the week. This doesn't sound very intuitive, does it? But I can't make myself think any other way. \n\nIn summary, I don't think I'm taking the right approach, but the mindset of an intuitive eater is my goal.

Literally five seconds into it, I turned my head, and i heard like... a squish/crunch, coming from my neck. I immediately went \"oh fuck\" and sat down. I pulled a muscle in my neck pretty badly, just from that. I cant move my head backwards or to the left at all without it feeling awful. So my dumb ed brain was like... okay but we still have 400 calories to work off so take some medicine and get over it. So i tried to stand up to get medicine and my vision started blacking out.\n\n I sat down and then started feeling nauseous and hot. Something i deal with is health anxiety/paranoia, so i have a hard time deciphering whether I'm having an anxiety attack and its giving me physical symptoms, or if the symptoms are actually happening (which has never been the case) but i always jump to the worst conclusion. \n\n So im freaking out, and shaking, and convincing myself im gonna die, just because i pulled a muscle in my neck. But then i start to realize, i cant finish exercising, even walking is too painful. So i have an even worse anxiety attack. And i cant stop crying about why my life is like this. I constantly work myself into exhaustion, this isn't the first time ive hurt myself from overexercise. I'm just so annoyed at myself, one for being so dramatic, and two for being mad at myself for not being able to keep going. Like im in a lot of pain and what im most upset about is not being able to burn calories. \n\n  My priorities are fucked up all the time, this ed has made me so selfish and so paranoid. Like Ive almost had an eating disorder for half my life. Im still young, but my body feels like I'm 100 years old, my health is deteriorating. Its not fair. Why do i have to spend most of my day exercising and hurting myself? Let alone the rest of the time when im THINKING about burning calories or food or how scared i am my body is gonna give up on me. Im sick of it. Im so tired of everything, and i know its so dramatic and not that big of a deal. I think this time it just hit me how much of my life im wasting and it kind of snowballed. I dont want to be like this anymore. And i know the next few days are gonna be even worse. I'm sick of feeling so alone and hopeless and like life is meaningless. Its just gonna be worse until my neck is better, but then ill just keep exercising until i hurt myself again. I'm so sick of everything\n\nThats the end of my rant i guess, its dumb, but thank you to anyone that reads it", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Maybe this isn't the right place for this question because of my health problems, but I do suffer from anorexia as well so this is the first place I thought of. So basically I had been trying to gain weight for a whole year. I finally managed to get back up to a healthy weight, but I struggled to maintain it and after I few months I got really sick one night and went to the ER. After that I lost two thirds of the weight I gained in just a month, but then I plateaued. I had been stuck at the same weight for three months. Typically I eat around 950 calories in a day because eating any more in often painful for me. Lately I have been really busy and needed more energy so for the past week or so I have been eating around 1300 calories. That is an average though. Some days I have been eating much more while others I have eaten less. \n\nSince I started eating more I seem to have gotten thinner. I don't own a scale, but I first noticed that my wrists were looking pretty bony. Then the other day I noticed that a pair of jeans I don't often wear was getting loose on me. I know it isn't stretching because I don't wear them much and have only washed them maybe twice. I was at the mall for Black Friday and tried on some size &gt;!00!&lt; skinny jeans because I couldn't find any in size &gt;!0!&lt; at this particular store and they fit me just fine. Like, I didn't feel that my movement was limited by them or that they were too tight for me. Since then I have also noticed that all of my bras seem too big for me and when I touch my chest there seems to be less fat in my breasts than usual. They're basically nonexistent at this point \ud83d\ude13 \n\nSince I'm losing weight everywhere I know that this isn't just a hormonal thing with fat moving from one place to another. Do you think that eating more is the cause of this apparent weight loss? My BMR is around 1250, so I suppose I am eating above that now.

Let\u2019s just say that lately I\u2019ve realised that eating disorders definitely run in the family, even if I don\u2019t understand the cause. My aunt and cousin suffer from orthorexia, they\u2019re literally obsessed, but of course they don\u2019t recognize it as an ED. I do, they really have a problem. My parents and other relatives have always been obsessed with weight and diets and, last but not least, my cousin (18F) suffered from severe anorexia, she\u2019s now recovered, and then there\u2019s me. This leads to a major issue that actually makes me suffer. I\u2019m now 20 years old but I\u2019ve been struggling with eating since I was 13; I think I\u2019ve never developed a real eating disorder since the beginning of 2019: I haven\u2019t eaten properly for months,  I often fast, and lately I\u2019m either restricting or bingeing and purging. But what makes me suffer is that nobody in my family knows what\u2019s going on with me, and I\u2019m not willing to tell them since I don\u2019t want to make my cousin suffer or make her think it\u2019s linked to her somehow, or worse, I don\u2019t want her to relapse... I always act like I\u2019m totally fine and I eat normally in front of them but I actually have an eating disorder and having to hide it somehow, knowing that it\u2019s an issue of the family, I don\u2019t know... just makes me suffer... how do you think I should act?", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

This was only about a week or so ago, acknowledging one of a few compulsive behaviors of mine. I was also to say aloud and get support from my mother, who really puts in effort to understand, and my loving boyfriend.\n\nA little of my story: I've not had the best relationship with food. As a kid my dad was not great, my perpetually tired mom worked a lot, so fast food felt too much a part of our dinner rotation. Even then I'd feel guilt and shame I couldn't put into words. Maybe because it reinforced how broken and sad my family was, in a way only a young child could see. \n\nI've been petite and skinny all of my life (now am 20 y/o, 5'3\" and I think around 106 lbs with clothes on) however in 4th grade, I developed a thyroid problem that caused me to gain weight. I felt very uncomfortable in my own skin. \"Meaty\" was the word I often used. It was the first experience of my body betraying me, and when I first encountered the body image struggles that all American girls make acquaintances with. \n\nWhen I was 16, the low moods and fearfulness I'd muddled through in life so far exploded into relentless depression and anxiety. Anxiety for me met nausea, depression meant lack of interest in food. The 1st month of my junior year of high school, I lost 13 pounds. By the time I was 18 and left for the city, I was 98 pounds. I'm already pale with a small build, and I looked like a skeleton. However jarring it was, it slowly became my normal.\n\nIn the city, I was able to find a better doctor who helped me both in counseling and with medication and supplements to finally lift up from my depression. I was amazed. I never thought it was possible. \nBut part of \"getting better\" meant putting on weight. I theoretically understood this to be good, something I desired even. Once it happened though, I broke down. My doctors couldn't understand, all they would focus on is I wasn't underweight like I was. \n\nThe fact is, whether good or bad, change is disorienting.\n\nLooking back now, I can see I took to binging the way I do now, but as I was so small, no doctors or my mom could condemn it, they only thought to view it as glad I was eating. \n\nAdmitting this was a problem sucked. I was emotionally terrorized at home, bullied in school, child of divorce, anxious, depressive, painfully stereotypical father issues. I'd cut, got messed up on prescription pills, come close to suicide.\n I wondered if there were any other behaviors to pinpoint how broken I am.\n\nBut now I'm in a point of my life where I'm pledging to be honest and truthful whenever I can, and always to myself. \n\nSo, hello fellows, I'm glad to find support in this community. I'm a Lil Drummer Girl. I have a binge eating disorder. I'm working on it like everyone else here. And I know this is way too long and not interesting anyone scrolling by; but in case you did read this long, I thank you.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

My mother thinks this is a \u201cchoice\u201d and says she can\u2019t afford recovery or an ED therapist. I have spoken to several and they said I need immediate help. This has been going on for about 4.5 months. \n\nI\u2019m terrified. I have severe food anxiety and  i have been told I have AFRID. I suffer from major depression and severe anxiety and also have Fibromyalgia. . I am also totally isolated.\n  \nMy father just died 10 days ago. \n\nI don\u2019t have body image issues or BED but my anxiety has made me practically anorexic. Last time i passed out I called 911 and they threw me in the psych ward and it was horrible. I was released after 2 days bc they saw I needed medical help. I will never go the hospital again. I would rather die in my house. I can\u2019t be in the psych ward again. \n\nI can\u2019t sleep from starvation and I\u2019m going crazy. I got my period for a day a few days ago and it stopped. I live in New York and no recovery centers anywhere take my insurance except psych hospitals \n\nI haven\u2019t been outside in ages . I have chronic migraines ( I\u2019m on medication but obviously this is overriding it) I feel like I\u2019m going pass out , I can barely get out of bed. I have blurry vision, heart palpitations, terrible body pain, and constantly have panic attacks all the time. Swollen glands, severe bloating , and my skin is horrible. I don\u2019t know if this is related or bc of lack of sleep.\n\nI fall asleep around 5 am and sleep all day. Then around 6 or 7pm I get up And watch TV until  my head hurts . I try to get down food but I don\u2019t feel hungry anymore and Thats so scary. I\u2019m drinking a lot of caffeine free tea and water. But I\u2019m really nauseous. I take zofran. My father was a doctor so I have a lot drugs here. \n\nNote: . I also have a lot of food allergies so eating has always been difficult. \n\nI feel like no one talks about the horrible insomnia and depression, anxiety and wanting to die when you can\u2019t get help  and the cost of impatient recovery.\n\nI have absolutely NO support system. I just gave up my therapy dog to my ex  bc I can\u2019t take care of him anymore. My heart is broken. He is all I have. He is everything I  have always had to live for. My ex said it was \u201csetback\u201d and he would bring him back when I\u2019m better but \u201d I don\u2019t see that happening. I\u2019m lost without him.\nI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m not dead yet. Why can\u2019t I die already? \nThank you for reading this. \u2764\ufe0f\nYou are all so brave I wish I was as strong as you all are . My mother always says how weak I am.

She often restricted what I could eat (like not eating pork because it would make me fat) and also glaring at me with disgust whenever I ate. Made it impossible for me to eat alone in public for a long time without fearing that people were thinking that I was fat. When I went to college, I obsessively began trying to lose weight so that I could avoid the 'Freshman 15' and preempt any comments regarding gaining weight. I started working out twice a day and restricting my calorie intake. Sophomore year, I started binging and then gaining weight, and then started purging whenever I felt ultra disgusted with what I ate. Also took laxatives as well. (Don't purge anymore though). At this point I was checked into an ED clinic at school, who I then ghosted because I felt like seeing them was counter productive to my goal of losing weight. Stopped purging the summer between Junior and Senior year. Senior year, I started going back to the methods I used Freshman year and ate only protein bars and shakes everyday while working out all the time. Lost a lot of weight doing this. Now I'm in my 5th year (graduated, then realized I was still lost so I extended to another year), deeply depressed and not eating, in part due to medication and also from a fear of gaining weight. \n\nSorry if this is rambling, but even given all of this a lot of times I feel like I don't have a problem. To me I never starved myself completely and was no bone skinny, so I don't actually have a \"real\" eating disorder. I purged maybe once or twice a month, so since I wasn't doing it every day it wasn't a real problem. Even now when I know I only eat one meal a day and that my Psychiatrist thinks it's a problem, I still don't believe it. It then becomes hard to really make an effort to heal, since I don't fully believe I have a problem. \n\nAny help with acceptance and healing? Sorry if this doesn't make sense. It's very hard for me to believe anything about myself if it isn't heavily reaffirmed (i.e. hard to not believe I'm fat since it was constantly told to me growing up)\n\nThank you!", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

Though sometimes I wonder if the hours spent on the bike are just an excuse to binge.  Burn 4000 calories on a ride?  Eat everything in sight.  Conversely, what's the way to reset after a binge?  A 6 hour bike ride of course!  It just so happens that if you binge enough (and ride enough to get rid of it) you will become pretty good at riding on the side.  But it can't go on like this forever, because no one can ride forever, and I think I'm finally at that limit where my body is so tired from the constant exercise that I have no choice but to accept the most recent binge without trying to ride it off.  \n\nSo, after bingeing yesterday and \"resetting\" with a big ride last night (disguised as a workout, oof course), I predictably binged again in the middle of the night - last night's was pretty bad.  And I sit here at work with half a box of pancake mix, a third of a jar of peanut butter, and probably 12 ounces of maple syrup in my gut barely able to fit in my pants from the bloating (I didn't bother wearing a belt today) and feeling as hungover as I ever have from drinking.  With a foot of snow outside, I will not try and ride this one off.  I will accept it, and try and move forward, breaking the cycle and starting anew tomorrow with a \"regular\" breakfast.  I hope this is the catalyst.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

{"post_id": "e5lid7", "created_utc": 1575398500, "title": "Video: Why the MUKBANG Trend is Glorifying Eating Disorders", "author": "gayrainnous", "self_text": "Hi fellow BED survivors,\n\nI don't think I've ever posted in here before, but I came across a video that really spoke to me and my simultaneous morbid obsession and searing hatred with/for the mukbang trend. For some background, I'm in my late teens (adult, but not, you know, ADULT) and have been binging since I can remember. I grew up in a household with an abusive older sibling who prided herself in taking my parents' attention off of me and their own wellbeing. Now, after finding myself a really incredible therapist and losing contact with that sibling, I'm beginning to heal and have discovered that connection between the emotional neglect I endured as a child and my lifelong habit of overeating, binging, and sneaking food behind my parents' backs. \n\nMore related to mukbang, I've been an avid kpop fan since I was around 11 years old. It did a number on my body image, I'm sure, but it also kept me positive in the hardest times. That said, I was aware of mukbangs back when they were simply a trend in South Korea. They weren't these 20 minute videos of people stuffing their faces and overfilling themselves, they were hour long broadcasts of hosts on Afreeca TV conversing with viewers and eating (albeit huge amounts) at a relatively normal pace. It didn't remind me of my binging episodes -- it was just a lot of food being eaten  by beautiful people who looked happy to be providing companionship to Korea's lonely young adult population.\n\nThen, of course, it caught on in the West and became a beacon of binging, indulgent self-hatred (see Nikocado Avocado), and overall disordered eating gore. At first they made me sick to watch, then I took solace in seeing thin people eat bigger amounts of food than even I did during binges. They encouraged me to embrace my binging behaviors and glamorize them when the craving hit, running to the store for ramen, takis, cake, etc and pretending to film my own mukbang while I ate myself sick.\n\nIt occurred to me a while ago that mukbangs were straight-up displays of binge eating disorder and other forms of disorderly eating. They aren't cute -- they're terrifying. It doesn't matter if the mukbanger is \"thin\" and \"beautiful\" by our standards. They're killing themselves by eating in this manner. \n\nToday, I sat down to eat a healthy lunch I'd made and queued up a mukbang by a sweet, softspoken youtuber I like. I thought it might encourage me to eat as I'd waited entirely too long to have a meal today and was feeling sick to my stomach as a result. This mukbanger is probably one of the best for me to watch, seeing as she never finishes the huge meals she makes and always stops eating once she's full. She feels more like the original mukbangers that came out of Korea. However, I still felt sick thinking about the cycle she must be in to film these large, indulgent meals every so often. So I searched for \"healthy mukbang,\" hoping to see people sitting down at their camera eating regular sized portions of balanced meals. Spoiler alert, there are none! Or, the ones that do exist are by mukbangers who \"go back on a diet\" as a result of gaining weight from their mukbangs. What a horrifying, vicious cycle to be in. Binge, restrict, binge, restrict. It's terrifying.\n\nThen, I came across this video in the search results: [Why the MUKBANG Trend is Glorifying Eating Disorders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2pYg76yi7I)\n\nI think this woman, Abbey Sharp, must be an angel. She spoke to everything I had been feeling about this trend and the conversation regarding conscious overeating for entertainment. She also says some things about HAES \"Health At Every Size\" and other body positive concepts based on clinical research and nutritional fact. This video has made me feel amazing and it has so few views.\n\nSorry if this is long, I just wanted to let you all see this. I haven't looked at this woman's (who, BTW is a registered dietitian) other videos, but it looks like she posts healthy recipes, offers nutritional advice, fights against misunderstandings re: disordered eating, and reviews popular youtuber's \"What I Eat In A Day\" videos on the regular. I think I'll be watching her videos next time I sit down to eat, or the next time I crave a binge. She made me feel whole.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I FEEL FAT. \n\nI\u2019m not. \n\nBut I feel that way. \n\nAnd I would do anything to not feel that way. \n\nThe voice hasn\u2019t been this loud since I went away to HOCO a few months ago and now it\u2019s back and screaming for my attention. \n\n\nThere are a lot of reasons I feel like this:\n\n-Thanksgiving \n\n-anxiety about my birthday party this weekend (I don\u2019t feel like anyone will come and also why would they bc I\u2019m not important)\n\n-being estranged from my immediate family (my mom is a narcissist and I had to cut off my whole fam) and it\u2019s my first holiday season away from them. (I haven\u2019t had a happy holiday with them in 10 years but I still miss them in spite of how miserable I would be at home.)\n\n-I have to give up my iced coffee habit TOMORROW (I am only netting $22 each paycheck after bills (so $88 per month) and I\u2019m spending that $22 on coffee) which was helping me to restrict and feel okay about eating dinner. \n\n-I (think) I\u2019m just coming out of hypomania and entering depression \n\n-I\u2019m as close to PMS as I can get (I dont get periods anymore) and that always increases my appetite by 1000%. \n\n-I have to apply for health insurance and I\u2019m scared I won\u2019t be able to afford the care I know I need\n\n-I\u2019m too broke to pay my therapy bill (completely my fault, I forgot about it and spent the money on groceries, other amenities and coffee ... I am stupid) I have no idea how I\u2019m gonna pay except to take money from my rent which also isn\u2019t a good idea but I\u2019m too proud and stubborn to ask for help.\n\n-I hit my GW a few weeks ago (I\u2019ve never been that low in my entire LIFE) and I was SO HAPPY because I wasn\u2019t even trying and now I just FEEL that I\u2019m up way way way too much. Realistically probably only like 7 pounds but I feel like a gross, horrible monster and I can\u2019t fucking stop eating.\n \n-I have to get another job if I want to stop being broke but my mental health is so fucking shitty that I can hardly stand working my 38 hours as it is. I know I could make myself do it but the idea of even applying makes me want to have a panic attack.\n\n-my birthday is next week and I had all these plans and ideas of how I would celebrate and I know this sounds stupid but all of that was dependent on me having money and I do not have money to spare for myself or even stuff at home (I know I can still celebrate and be happy but my birthdays were not special when I lived at home and I wanted this one to be extra special because for the first time I know I deserve to feel special and it\u2019s disappointing to be broke.)\n\n-Christmas is coming up and it is my favorite holiday and I won\u2019t even have the money to buy the stuff I need to DIY gifts for my friends and family and BF ... if I had it my way I would literally spend an entire paycheck on gifts for the people I care about. \n\n\nIdk I guess a lot of this feels really whiny and I know it\u2019s not specifically ED related but feeling all this crap makes it so much harder to exist as a person and to feel okay in my body. I feel very out of control and very defeated. And very lonely but I also can\u2019t stand the idea of having to see anyone right now. Just typing this I realized how fucking sad I am today and how much I just want to unzip my skin and get out. I can\u2019t stand myself. \n\nIf you made it this far thanks for reading. Even though I feel like crap, I want y\u2019all to know you are beautiful and awesome and I believe in you even if I don\u2019t believe in myself.

She now thinks this is the reason I developed an ED - too much space.

She now comes to my treatments, chaperones me, drives me there and back like I'm 12, watches me eat, sits with me for most of the day making sure I don't purge. Brings me food at work on my lunch break to sit with me and watch as I eat it. Then stays in the mall that I work at just because being away from me makes her worry too much.

I get texts like, \"drink more water pls\" and \"have u had ur snack\" etc. I kind of just don't go anywhere anymore because I know she's sitting at home being a nervous wreck the whole time.

Since my life is not in danger, I ask you to not be worried. I just need your advice on my situation.\n\nFirst of all, I'll be straight, I have serious problems. My gf  cheated on my 3month ago and even though I'm not depressed (I think  depressed people can't really live their lives, like they can't \"move\"  work, do sport ect...) but it costs me a lot of energy. It was important to me to introduce that because my food habits is really correlate to it.\n\nI'm  basically disgusted of a lot of things. First, I'm disgusted by food.  Then, I'm disgusted by my own body. I lost a lot of weight (well, I was  around 63kg, now I'm 56kg and it gets lower every day). 56kg is not a  big deal, I'm 160cm so my BMI and my bodyfat are really good.\n\nBut, as I told you my body disgusts me, and the thought that i  could reach again 63kg makes me sick. Plus, I mainly eat raw  vegetables, nuts and fruits because I feel bad after eating a \"good\"  dish. I do my own cooking.\n\nFinally, I have some \"peace\" moments,  where I feel pretty good, and where I am hungry, so I may eat during  these moments, but either I regret having ate later, even I regret while  I'm eating and I just give up with my meal.\n\nI'm not sure my introduction is correct, if you have any questions, ask them I'm here to get answer I'll do all my possible to help you having an honest opinion.\n\nLast part, I told a friend of mine about my \"new\" (new -&gt; 4 months, it started in a period where I was anxious and I couldn't eat, and now I can eat but I'm  disgusted) food habit, and she answers me something about depression  and \"death impulses\" (we both are French so it's more obvious in our  mother's language, but she meant that unconsciously being disgusted of  food, and being disgusted of \"good food\" mean I may want to die. I want  to be really clear, my health is not in danger.).", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I\u2019ve been doing better and eating normally but a nasty argument with my mom sent me back to restriction. I don\u2019t know what people without eating disorders do but I\u2019m too upset to eat anyway and starving myself is the only good coping mechanism that exists. Part of the reason I have an ed is I can\u2019t eat when I\u2019m upset and I\u2019m upset a lot. Anyone else? I\u2019ve tried every other coping mechanism. Guess the groceries I did buy will just go to waste.\n\nI realized how angry I am, how hurt, how lonely. I try so hard everyday. To be skinny, fit, join the gym, wash my car, walk my dog enough, do good at work, make my mom happy, do all my chores, be friendly and kind to people, work on my depression and anxiety. I\u2019m so fucking tired. With the exception of my dog, I just don\u2019t even care anymore. I try and try and cling to any semblance of my life improving like a pathetic child and then one argument with my mom and I\u2019m back to extreme eating disorder/depression/wanting to kill myself.\n\nMy dad killed himself. Getting over that has been the hardest thing and just last night I cried watching a movie that\u2019s not even sad. It\u2019s been 6 years. It\u2019s about all the sadness I can bare and I still fight ptsd from it everyday which is a disgusting, cruel experience if uve ever dealt with it.\n\nAnd then my eating disorder claws at me and it\u2019s another stress on my soul. Just last night I literally had a conversation with myself. For the first time I could distinctly hear the evil restriction voice. It was all quiet and snake like \u201cjust fast, don\u2019t cook\ud83d\ude42\u201d and I literally was like \u201cu evil fucking bitch shut the fuck up and get out of my face.\u201d\n\nWell she won today.

I know I need to distance myself from her, I\u2019m so lonely and I barely have the energy or mental health to let people I don\u2019t know in. I have my co workers when I\u2019m at work. But today is my day off and this is where I am. My mom is not a bad person, she\u2019s wounded and flawed like me.

Here's what I learned, hopefully it can help some of you!\n\n-consistency is way more important than hard work\n\n-set smaller goals (ie eating even a bite vs not eating at all)\n\n-you can start recovery again as often as you need to. When you fall off the wagon, it's not going anywhere without you! You have to get back in the seat and make it go again.\n\n-everything is a battle. You don't always win. Keep fighting.\n\nI know this doesn't cure anything and that our brains tell us the opposite. Just make a promise to yourself to keep trying. Please.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

So I've never went for 2500-3000+ cal a day plans, I've been gradually increasing my daily intake by 100-200 (I didn't count though, especially after the extreme hunger phase passed) so I tried to just eat whatever I felt like (hunger cues are still weak and I don't have any cravings so far).  \n\n\nSo I've gained like 6-7 pounds so far, but I notice that most of this weight sits in the area from my waist to my hips.

I used to be pretty fat (m, 100 kg, 181 cm), until about a year and a half ago, I finally got my shit together and started losing weight. I ate less, joined the gym, started eating healthy food and all the good stuff. Soon enough, the pounds started dropping.\n\nThe more I got into it, the more serious I became. I started out trying all kinds of diets: keto, vegan, paleo. I restricted my calories more and more to get faster results. In the end, I ate only one meal per day and limited myself to 1200 calories and went to the gym 3-4 times per week.\n\nThe results were amazing. For the first time in my life, I was *thin*. My clothing size dropped from XL to S over the course of a year or so.\n\nAt some point, my wife started to tell me that I was overdoing it, that I was thin enough. At that point, I was 65 kg. I didn't stop, though. I could not. When I looked at myself in the mirror, I still found myself to be fat. So I kept going.\n\nWhen I hit 58 kg and became physically weak, I realized that it was too much. I promised myself I would eat more, stop counting calories. I deleted the calorie counter app and started eating breakfast and lunch again. I still focused on healthy food, but I decided I would eat more of it.\n\nThe problem is, calorie counting has from that point been so burned into my brain that I didn't even need the app anymore. I just know how much calories are roughly in my food and I still cannot eat more than that. Sure, I didn't stop myself at 1200 anymore, but I rarely go over 2000.\n\nI gained some weight back. I \"cheated\" myself by telling me that a protein shake is OK after a gym workout, that a piece of chocolate with my coffee doesn't hurt, those things. Right now I'm at 66 kg.\n\nThe problem is, I am still fucking terrified of getting fat again. There's this mental blockade that stops me from eating, even if I want to. Even when I know I should. Even when I'm hungry.\n\nWikipedia defines anorexia as \"an eating disorder, characterized by low weight, food restriction, fear of gaining weight, and a strong desire to be thin.\" [[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_nervosa)] I fear I tick all those boxes.\n\nMy BMI is still in the normal range, though. I don't look anorexic. I am afraid that if I don't find a way to get this under control, I might actually end up there.\n\nThere always is this pressing desire to lose weight again. I know I don't need to, but I *want* to. It's weird.\n\nThanks for reading.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

This lasted about 14 months. \nThen this year, Senior year when I\u2019m supposed to have my stuff figured out I FUCK UP. Junior year and summer was amazing I developed a healthy relationship with food, I ate all the time and was losing weight, I gained muscles and was toned and still ate hella chocolate when I wanted.

A few weeks ago I had 2 seizures, the first of which was behind the wheel of a car. I ended up in the ER twice, got injured in the car accident, hurt myself during the seizures, etc. I\u2019m still dealing with memory loss and time distortion as well as issues with processing things. Most importantly, the seizures were NOT from my eating disorder (I\u2019m in recovery right now)\u2014they were most likely from an antidepressant I had started several days before. \n\nHowever, ever since all this happened, my housemate has been incredibly hostile towards me, snapping at me and giving me the silent treatment, and the other two people I live with (who are supposedly my partners) are barely talking to me as well. I know from talking to the partner I\u2019ve had for 5 years that my housemate thinks that I\u2019m to blame for having the seizures and that it\u2019s because of how underweight I am. I\u2019ve tried reaching out to them and telling them that we need to talk but they refuse to respond to me. Being at home is exhausting and miserable and I feel so left out all the time now. Especially because I can\u2019t drive for 6 months after a seizure, I feel trapped and so incredibly lonely. \n\nHow do I get it through to them that this fundamentally isn\u2019t my fault? Even if the seizures were because I\u2019m underweight, this is an *illness* not something that I\u2019m doing on purpose. I\u2019m trying incredibly hard to recover right now\u2014I\u2019m eating a LOT and have gained over 10% of my body weight in the last 3-4 weeks.

They probably eat one huge meal a day and overestimate how much they eat and feel full too quickly therefore they feel like they eat too much\n2. They literally might have a fast metabolism\n3. They naturally have low appetite signals so even if they eat a normal amount they might feel tremendously full. \n4. They are trying to hide their eating disorder which may or not be aware of. \n\nFirst off, assuming they don't have disordered eating, they aren't \"eating three baby carrots a day\" if they maintained that figure for a while, they averaging a TDEE a little less than someone with a normal weight. For example, my UGW tdee of 17 bmi is 1400 calories. I am literally 30 pounds heavier and my tdee is only off by 150 calories. That is two oreos a day difference. They are literally eating the same amount of a normal healthy person by off by 100-300 calories, assuming they have similar exercise and they aren't severely underweight. They LITERALLY CANNOT be starving themselves unless they go through binge cycles.\n\nAnd if they do suffer with an ED, why are we so bitter? We should show more empathy than project that they binge eat and just lie to others to make them feel bad. \n\nI know this is an ED safe space but we should monitor our toxic behavior towards other people who aren't even doing anything to us. \n\nThere are people on here who DO NOT BINGE as surprisingly as that sounds. We shouldn't mock them or assume that they binge like most of us on here do.  Their thoughts and feelings are still valid and we shouldn't assume everyone binges and if theyre skinny and complain that they can't gain weight they're just rubbing it in our faces to make us feel jealous. This is unwelcoming and unsupportive.\n\nIf you still think that's impossible please browse /r/gainit or /r/xxgainit and see that people really struggle with getting their calories in or watch youtubers who talk about skinny shaming and how it affects their self esteem. \n\nThey are NOT trying to rub it in our faces.

I\u2019ve never had such an attentive partner and it makes me realize some irrational things that have been normal to me or I brush off. \n\nFor instance, when questioned what I\u2019ve eaten that day no matter what the context (wanted to see if I wanted to go out to eat, if we just wanted to snack ect) I get defensive and brush it off like don\u2019t worry about what the hell ive eaten.

Like I have shame associated with the fact that I\u2019ve even eaten food. \n\nI didn\u2019t think it effect me that much but we were at work and he asked me what I wanted to eat later when he came over, immediately I panicked.

Here's some background information about me and my ED history:\n\nI'm 20 and a university student, and I generally consider myself recovered, but I have been having more frequent bouts of restriction and relapses and things of the sort. I first developed anorexia when I was about 14, struggled really horribly for approximately a year and a bit, and then my family intervened. This may sound grim, but I was really good at restricting and losing weight quickly, which is why my family caught on so fast.\n\nRecently I have been having a really hard time with my body dysmorphia, and I made the mistake of weighing myself while drunk at a party a few times recently. My weight right now is the highest it has ever been, 124lbs, which it is not by any means what anyone other than myself would consider too heavy for a 5'1\" twenty year old girl. I have this  goal now that I am aware of my weight to lose at least ten pounds, and I have been going to the gym with my mom. She knows how I have been feeling regarding body image and food-related stuff, and is supportive in my desire to lose some weight (not -10 pounds but more so just to be more active and healthy), and has been keeping a close eye on me about food and stuff. But now that I have told her that I want to lose weight, and after she said that she supports it as long as I do so in a way that is not just extreme restriction, I feel a bit more shame regarding the food I eat because not only do I feel like I am failing myself, but also her, as she is aware of my desire to lose a bit of weight.  I have been super conscious about how I look, and I have been obsessively monitoring what I eat, which includes occasionally restricting my calories in a way that resembles my behaviour in the height of my ED six and a half years ago.\n\nNot only have I been incredibly self conscious and body checking all the time, but I have been finding myself identifying and reducing myself to just someone who is anorexic, meaning I have been monitoring my behaviour and doing things that I would think my former anorexic self would do. For example, just now I got up to go make a small snack so I could munch while writing my essay, but I stopped myself because I thought \"you're anorexic, you don't make snacks/eat past \\_\\_ o'clock\". I have been following old rules I have made for myself years in the past and holding this title of anorexic over my head like its all I have ever amounted to. I can't stop thinking \"you're anorexic you don't do this\" or \"you're anorexic, you should behave/look like this\". It's also odd because I want to live up to this label I have held over my own head recently. I have a strange desire to be ill, even though I know six years ago I tore my household apart, and I also wouldn't be able to maintain my academics, and it would also effect my relationship with my boyfriend and my other friends as well.\n\nThis is a bit of a rant but also its me reaching out for some kind words of encouragement or reassurance. I feel like I'm stuck in a hole and I can't seem to find motivation to climb out of it. I also seem to like it. I don't know.\n\nTL;DR, I have been struggling with frequent relapses with anorexia, and I have been reducing my entire identity to just being 'anorexic' and nothing else.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I wound up crying and my professor sent me home early. Extremely fucking embarrassing on my part.\n\nAfter I left, I had to go into work. I was texting the guy I was seeing about how I was going to pick up dinner after my shift because I hadn't eaten yet today. I was planning on getting a salad or something. I binged the entire week of Thanksgiving and I'm back to restricting because I feel fucking awful about it.\n\nHe insisted on bringing me food. I told him not to. He said he was going to surprise me anyway. So he shows up to my work with a MASSIVE fucking bag of Chinese food. It's like $40 worth of all of the things I had told him about. Distraught doesn't even begin to explain how I felt. I'm not kidding. It was enough to feed a family of four. I told him he really shouldn't have, but he leaves pleased with his kind gesture.\n\nSo he texts me later to tell me he wanted to do something nice for me and he knows I've had a rough day. And I essentially told him, \"Thank you, but this only added to my stress.\" I was borderline in tears in my stockroom because I didn't know what to do with it all and I felt too guilty to throw it away.\n\nHe knows I'm anorexic. He knows how stressed I get around high calorie food. Especially a lot of it. He tries to sneak food into me. Tries to feed me while I'm driving sometimes. That sort of thing. And I get it, but it's the wrong fucking way to go about it.\n\nSo I wound up eating a ton of it and going over today. The exact opposite of what I wanted to do. And honestly, after feeling sick earlier, the last thing I wanted to eat was greasy fried rice and spare ribs. And now he's definitely upset with me for not being more grateful. \n\nSo now I'm crying in bed over fucking Chinese food. I hate this/anorexia/myself/literally everything right now.\n\n\n\nTLDR: The guy I'm seeing brought me enough Chinese food to feed a family of four and is upset that I wasn't more grateful for it and I overate it out of guilt.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

The stimulant is because I was just diagnosed with ADHD and it's supposed to help. Stimulants do have an appetite suppressing effect which my doctor and the psychologist I saw are concerned about. The laxative was prescribed by a gastroenterologist. Apparently since fiber didn't help as he previously suggested laxatives are the next step, but I don't believe that I am constipated. Still, there is reason to believe it might help reduce my bloating which may in turn reduce some of my other symptoms. That being said, I am a little worried about combining an appetite suppressant and a laxative. I will likely be eating less and then when I do eat I'll be getting rid of everything really quickly. I know laxatives don't actually make you lose fat because everything you eat still gets digested before it is expelled from your body, but it may translate to weight loss on the scale as I will always be pretty empty when I get weighed and I will probably also be a bit dehydrated so less water weight. I figured people here probably have a lot of experience with stuff like this, so it seems a good place to ask. I'm a bit worried about both of them being addictive, but also I don't want to lose weight that isn't fat and have my doctor get concerned over nothing. She is already concerned that I weighed a little less than before when I had a physical recently so she asked a nurse to weigh me again today when I saw her to get my prescription for the stimulant. I think with all my clothes on I went from 115 lbs to 110 so I'm still above my lowest weight, but I'm getting close and if I reach my lowest weight she might get worried and make me change prescriptions.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I feel like shit and I only eat once a day sometimes once every two days. But I am losing weight. I want to be so skinny I can be better. I can be the best. \n\nAm I depressed? I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t feel sad anymore. I don\u2019t want to die either. I like being alive. I just want to be thin. \n\nSorry for the rambling. I don\u2019t have anyone I can talk to.

Relapse imminent...", "author": "PoolOfTicks", "self_text": "Last night, I cried a little before getting in the shower with my boyfriend because I didn't want him to see what I've become. As if he hasn't. Then he initiated sex and I went with it because I've been dismissive of his needs. We decide to finish showering and finish this afterwards.\n\nGot back to it a bit later in the living room, but had to move to the bed because the futon \"wasn't built for this and might break\" (we've successfully fucked on that thing many times in the past...). \n\nGo to the bed, switch up positions, and I hear the fat slaps starting and turned to cry into the bed. He's getting tired and I know I should get on top to finish, but my tears have welled up and began to fall out of my eyes. I can't let him see these, I can't talk about this right now, I'm mortified. I successfully hide my tears and distress. He says we can take a break. \n\nHe leaves the bedroom and I try to gather myself, pretending to look for my shirt to lag behind a bit. I heat up my tea, blow my nose, wipe away the few more tears that escaped my eyes, and go back to the futon with him. We don't cuddle like we were before. He eventually falls asleep, laying on the opposite side (so feet to feet). My thighs in the foreground of my view, I stare at him, amazed he's put up with me for so long and disgusted in myself for the unintentional cruelty. Denying him sex and intimacy because I can't let go of myself for one moment. \n\nHe admitted a few weeks ago how guilty he feels because I haven't orgasmed in a while. I know he can't hear me despite my efforts to explain it has nothing to do with him, the quality of sex, or my attraction to him. It is simply that the thought of orgasming is laughable, this disgusting body isn't worthy of achieving/recieving such pleasure because I'm too aware of its inability to truly reciprocate.

{"post_id": "e6l2ev", "created_utc": 1575569578, "title": "Some Seemingly Small, But Truly Big, Successes", "author": "thewordfountain1", "self_text": "I started intuitive eating, skeptically, 3-4 weeks ago. It's been hard to say \"eff it\" and eat whatever I like whenever I like. It's been hard to trust that things will even out eventually. At the beginning, I had a lot of stomach aches. But slowly, things have been improving. I didn't realize just how much until earlier when I went to pick up my lunch, so now I'd like to make a list of a bunch of little successes.\n\n* This morning, I ate leftover samosas from last night's dinner *while* standing on the scale. *I hadn't gone to the bathroom yet,* ***and*** *I was wearing jeans*. My obsession with weight loss had all these little harmful rules built into the simple action of standing on a scale, and it was nice that I didn't care about whether I was wearing pants, whether I'd peed yet, or whether I ate before or after the scale. And you know what? The scale was within my usual weight range.\n* During my lunch break I was headed to the bank to drop off a deposit for my job. I realized I felt like binging. In the past, I never had the presence of mind to notice these emotions and say, \"This is a desire to binge. Why?\" But that's what I did. I asked why, and I realized it's because I'm dealing with withdrawal from the usual excitement/dopamine hits of knowing when I'll next see my crush. Since the semester's over, we've basically had to say goodbye, and it's been making me really depressed. I know I'll get over this little crush, but it's been hard nonetheless. It was really nice to recognize why I felt that desire and just accept it.\n* After the bank, I was headed to Pret a Manger, to grab whatever I felt like, when I was struck by the realization that I wanted both of my usual orders. I couldn't decide. In the past I would normally get both, knowing I would feel lethargic and ill if I ate it all. I thought about grabbing one, eating it in Pret, and then taking the rest to the office to eat in front of my co-workers. Instead, I recognized that was harmful to me and would make me feel sick and guilty later. It even *sounded* exhausting. I just picked one, brought it back to work, and ate in front of my co-workers as usual. \n* Since intuitive eating, I've also been consuming a lot more soda and Starbucks drinks. I usually pick up the latter during my lunch break, and consume the diet coke we have in the office pretty regularly. Instead, today I was just like, \"Both sounds like a lot; I just want one.\" It wasn't about what was healthier, or worrying about looking like a pig in front of my co-workers, or guilt. I just *wanted* to choose one. I chose the soda.\n\nBonuses:\n\n* A few days ago, I was walking to get Chipotle after class. It was cold, and I didn't want to walk all that way, but usually it isn't a deterrent in stopping me from taking a whole bowl home and inhaling it in 5 minutes.  I walked past a Sweetgreen (salad place), and I thought, \"That smells *good.* I think I would *feel* better after eating it too. I kind of want some.\" I stood outside of it for a few minutes, contemplating about what I really wanted. I picked the salad.\n* Yesterday, I was eating another Sweetgreen salad with my friend. I wanted to finish the whole bowl even though I was crazy full. I was complaining to my friend about it, and she said, \"Listen to your body. Throw it out.\" I did. I also threw out my reusable fork with it, and had to go fishing, but it was nice to have a friend in my corner. I felt so free throwing out the rest of that salad because I genuinely was stuffed.\n\nAll in all, it's been working for me. By intuitive eating, it's almost like I'm training my body to recognize how certain foods make me feel. Before when I was restricting, I would eventually binge and consequently lose all connection with my body. I couldn't tell how certain foods made me feel. Now that I'm learning this, it's allowing me to make empowered choices that feel good, rather than choices that are fueled by guilt.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

And maybe, in a sense, she contributed. However, I was really thinking about it, and I actually think a lot of my behaviors come from my dad. He is a tall, thin man but always seems to be trying to lose weight. I don't think he's ever been happy with himself. He won't eat all day before and during work but then he comes home and basically binges. He admits that he cannot control himself around a lot of foods and there have been several instances where he has argued with my mom because she bought dessert or snack foods. He claims she's trying to make him fat. He goes on a 4-mile walk everyday. If he feels that he has eaten too much he will go on another 4-mile walk. I never thought much of it because he's such a geeky intellectual and for some reason I just couldn't really imagine him having issues with food or his body but now that I think of it, if there is any parent I picked up my behaviors from it is my dad, not my mom. Of course, I think they both contributed. My mom is the one who comments on my body. My dad rarely ever comments on the way I look. But at the end of the day my mom eats normally and it's my dad who has the weird eating and exercising habits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't resent them or anything. I'm past that phase. They live in the same society I do and have been exposed to the same beauty standards. I don't blame them for having insecurities and having their own issues with food and exercise.

Due to this, my weight over the years fluctuates highly depending on my activity level. I'm currently recovering from an injury, so my activity level is quite low aside from walking that I'm easing into.\n\n\nI've tried intermittent fasting and one meal a day before. This essentially worked for me to hit my calories for the day, but it didn't help binge eating because I would inhale a giant meal or essentially one big binge a day. I decided that I would try an extended fast where I only consumed water to see if that would be a hard reset for my body. \n\n\nI went in with the mentality to do this for a week. I ended up making it three days. I wasn't disappointed in myself. Since I've broke the fast, I've been a lot more mindful of my eating. I try to do the whole three square meals per day and I've been eating proper portions for my height. If I feel the need to snack, I will, but I haven't. I've been eating a lot more slowly and focusing on placing my utensil down and chewing my food before swallowing. Taking my time has made me feel actually feel the feeling of fullness for the first time in forever. I allow myself to have dessert and I've been satisfied with one cookie/small piece of whatever if desired. This NEVER occurred before. Typically, if I buy a large dessert item, you can kiss that entire ice cream/brownie/cake goodbye, but I have self-control now.\n\n\nI know that extended fasts may not be for everyone, but I think it may have helped me. I plan to do a 3-7 day extended fast each quarter of the year for a total of four fasts in order to reset my body again.\n\n\nI wish us all the best in overcoming our binges.

{"post_id": "e6xh79", "created_utc": 1575631030, "title": "This thinking skill saved my life", "author": "OverseasDrip", "self_text": "Hello everybody,\n\nI think I can help you. I think there is something helpful for you in this post.You are using your willpower in a wrong way. With just willpower you can't overcome every urge. You have to use your willpower to discipline your way of thinking.\n\nYou see, not every thought you have is from your conscious self. You have free will. You can think positive thoughts, but you also have negative thoughts, thoughts that encourage binge eating for example.\n\nYou can think positively, you can say to yourself with your own free will ''I feel the urge, but I am not gonna binge.'' That is your own thought, you've created it consciously. However you might get the thought ''I am going to binge''. You didn't create that thought yourself. You observed that thought. This is a big difference. This thought arised from your subconscious due to your programming. Maybe you have a trauma and used eating as a coping mechanism since you were young. Subconsciously, you linked your urges or emotions to eating. So everytime you get ''triggered'', you have binge-encouriging thoughts. Those thoughts are not YOU! YOUR thoughts are the one you create yourself with your own willpower.\n\nYou have learned yourself to think in a way. This way of thinking has become automatic. If you look in the mirror and you get the thought ''I am ugly'', you are not using your own free will thinking that. I'm sure about that. That's self sabotage and nobody does that on purpose. You can observe that thought, and then think with your own free will ''No, I'm not ugly. I am as I am and that's okay.''\n\nIf you apply this technique a thousand times, being mindful with your thoughts, you literally reshape your way of thinking and using will power in a different way. You don't have to fight the battle you'll always lose, the fight against the urges. This time, you fight your automatic way of thinking. Your coping mechanism. You create a new way of thinking.\n\nThis saved my life. I don't binge anymore, EVER. I may get triggered, I may OBSERVE a binge-encouring thought, but I realise that I don't created that thought with my free will, so it is not my thought. At that moment I say to myself I am not going to binge, and I realize that THAT is my own thought, created with my own free will. Those automatic thoughts are not yours and can't make you do anything. Those thougths don't have control over your voluntary muscles, your muscles which you use to grab, eat, swallow and purge food with.\n\nWhat helps is that you celebrate every trigger you overcame. Tell somebody who is close to you that you didn't follow an urge. Don't keep it to yourself. Everytime you struggle, tell somebody you are struggling. Tell your mother ''Mom I have these thoughts too binge right now but I am not going to do it. That binge thought is not my own, but the thought to not binge is.''\n\nAlso, read Dr Joe Dispenza's book ''Breaking The Habit of Being Yourself''. That book scientifcally shows you the difference between observing your automatic thoughts and creating your own conscious thoughts.\n\nI hope this helps a bit. Being mindful is the key. Don't beat yourself up if this doesn't work right away, it is a process. I encourage you to meditate to learn how to observe those automatic thoughts. You need to see the difference between those automatic binge-encouraging thoughts and your own free will thoughts. You don't want to binge. I can guarantee that. You never use your own conscious free will to think binge-encouriging thoughts, those thoughts are automatic, subconscious and a form of coping.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

In my teens, I ate a lot and was always hungry but had an abnormally high metabolism and simply didn\u2019t gain weight. As I got older, my metabolism normalised but my eating habits stayed the same. At first my weight gain was gradual, effecting my cup size more than anything. As time wore on, I began to notice my face looking fuller and my once-defined abdominal muscles looking looser. You get the picture. When I was 20, we took a holiday to Spain and I realised that I was gaining. It was the first time in those two or three years that I had really taken a long, hard look at myself. I had to confront my weight gain. Even with the knowledge that I was nearing 9stone at 5\u20194, I couldn\u2019t stop. I entered my first year of university and began to comfort eat more than I thought possible; I lived on my own and was in control of my finances. I feasted on high-fat dips, Nutella, crisps and all manner of * truly delicious* but incredibly fattening foods. By the end of that academic year, I was 10st5lbs and officially overweight. All I could think about was food. Food, food, food. My family began to try and control my eating, they bought less junk and would scold me if I exceeded my daily snack limit. It was humiliating. It only made me more miserable because I was just so hungry. In late 2018, I was put on Elvanse (Vyvanse) for adult ADHD and it changed my life. I stopped thinking about food, the insatiable hunger disappeared and I lost the weight I had gained. This carried on until recently. I had a cold and have been depressed for months because I\u2019m unhappy at university. My medication is wearing off much sooner and the appetite suppression lasts 2 hours max. For the first time in a year, I\u2019ve started thinking about food again. I can\u2019t stop. I feel hungry all the time. It is the most soul destroying feeling in the world. It feels like a weight that clings to my insides and bears down on my shoulders at all times. No matter what I eat, I feel hungry. I have requested a dosage increase, but will not have it until the new year. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to make it through Christmas.

Don't know if he realizes what he's doing because he knows about my ED but doesn't know the extent of it (thinks I'm recovered although I'm definitely not).  Anyways, first time around, he tells me that his Mom thinks I'm fat.  He was like \"I told her it was muscle but she didn't believe me haha lol\".  That slightly triggered me but I was good with ignoring it because I was having a REALLY GREAT WEEK.  At that point I didn't think I was fat, was letting myself eat, and was perfectly okay with my weight.  \n\nThen yesterday (the day after what happened above), the same friend gave me two chocolates.  I was doing fine that day as well, and decided I wanted the motherfucking chocolate.  So I ate it like a normal person without food issues would.  Then, as I had my second one he literally says \"There's 52 calories in each chocolate.  You just ate two.... Now you're gonna get faaaaattt!!!\".  I had no idea how to respond (and there were other people around, 2 of which know about my ED to the real extent) so I just sarcastically said \"Thanks a lot.\"  \n\nWelp, that second comment really triggered me and I spiraled down into the thoughts of wanting to lose weight/restrict/etc....  \n\nThen today I had a cinnamon bun for snack (which my Mom saw me eat) because I was trying to get back into the mindset I was in earlier this week.  After my snack I said that I was full (and I was) because I had a large lunch (which is true) and because of the snack I just had.  Then, I said that I didn't want bubble tea because I was full.  My mom was a bit pissed because she wanted me to have it, but let it go.  Or so I thought.  \n\nAbout 30 minutes later, we get home and I see muffins on the counter.  I want one, and decided that I am going to have one because I want one and at this point should try not to restrict.  My mom decides to say \"Well I thought you weren't hungry.  Why are you eating now?\".  This further triggers me and I stop with the half of the muffin in my mouth, put the untouched half down, and immediately go to the bathroom.  In the bathroom, I spit out the rest of the muffin, and flush it down the toilet.

I just need support/advice.\n\nBackstory: I developed an eating disorder in 2018, EDNOS/atypical anorexia. I continued to use my disordered behaviors until around June of this year, and started recovery. I had a couple small relapses at the start, but I have been pretty steady with recovering since about August. I gave up weighing myself as often as I was (which was a lot, as I\u2019m sure many of you may relate to). I started eating \u201cnormally\u201d, or like I was eating before the eating disorder. But now, I am so hungry all the time and I\u2019m eating more than I was before I even developed my eating disorder. I weighed myself for the first time in a pretty long time today, and I have gained weight and am now back to the weight I was pre-ED. Which isn\u2019t over or underweight, it\u2019s normal but a bit on the higher end of normal. My family (who aren\u2019t aware I had/have an eating disorder in the first place due to problems that are too long to get into) has pointed out that I\u2019ve gained a little bit of weight. When I was in the thick of my eating disorder, I wasn\u2019t underweight, I was at the \u201cperfect\u201d weight for my height. But now I\u2019m worried. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve developed or starting to develop a form of BED. Maybe it\u2019s just a recovery thing, but I still am so scared. I have a medical condition that I take medication for, and for the medicine to be at the right dose I have to be at a certain weight and I\u2019m worried about gaining any more weight than I already have because of that. But I don\u2019t know how to lose weight without falling back into my old habits, and having to start all over again. I have not been able to see a professional about this all yet, I recovered initially all on my own. \n\nI apologize for the ramble, but if anyone has some insight or is able to offer some support I will very much appreciate it.

But.\n\nOn Thursday I went way over my calories for the first time in just over a month. I was probably actually sitting just above maintenance but I was still thinking \"screw it, I've already blown today, so I may as well just binge just this once\" like we all know and love (not). But as I'm sure many of you also experience, a binge is never \"just this once\". For me, that becomes two days, then four days, then a week, two weeks... etc.\n\nBut this time I stopped that spiral.\n\nI picked the one food I wanted to eat the most and I gave myself permission to eat it **because I knew that if I binged I would eat that food anyway.** So say that food is 1000 cals. The thought of giving myself \"permission\" to eat 1000 cals over my limit is terrifying, right? But the reality is that if I got into a binge cycle, I would still eat that food *and then thousands more cals on top of it.*\n\nIt's so tempting to think that if I go over my limit, the day is \"ruined\", and so going 100 cals over feels just as bad as going 1000 cals over. BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT A SMALLER BINGE *IS* BETTER THAN A BIGGER BINGE. It IS better to be \"only\" 1000 cals over your limit than to be 2000, or 3000, or 5000... etc.\n\nSo I paused. I repeated to myself that this wasn't going to become a binge because I was in control of this, I was CHOOSING to eat this food, and after I'd finished it, I was going to choose to STOP, rather than just look for the next thing I could binge on.\n\nAnd... it worked.\n\nI ate the thing, and any time I started to feel guilty/panicked about the calories I reminded myself \"1000 is better than 5000\", etc. And because I let myself enjoy it, by the time I'd finished it, I'd sufficiently calmed down and had the mental clarity to remind myself of all the other reasons why I didn't want to keep binging.\n\nAnd the next day I was back to normal. I didn't want to binge. I kept my cals low yesterday and today and looking at MFP, surprise surprise, my week averages out to something totally reasonable. That would NOT be the case if I had gone through with my binge like I was starting to plan and eaten thousands more cals, even if I HAD stopped after one day (unlikely).\n\nThe thought of feeling okay with purposefully eating 1000 cals over my limit seems impossible and frightening, but if you think you might be about to fall into a binge trap, just keep repeating to yourself *eating ONLY this is better than eating this PLUS MORE.* If your only two feasible options are to eat one calorific thing vs. many calorific things, the choice seems obvious. The focus is on *regaining control* over your eating.\n\nI hope this made sense to anyone else here who struggles with binge eating. Before November I had been stuck in a binge-restrict cycle for almost three months and so I was really scared by what I felt on Thursday. But this worked! So I hope it can be helpful to maybe someone else, too. xx\n\n**TL;DR: Forcibly give yourself permission to eat a bit over your calories so you don't eat even more over your calories**", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

She sent me a picture of herself post workout and asked \"why does my face always look like a tomato after i work out\", and thing is, she always mentions working out, or diet, or loss of appetite only when I do.  And that day I had mentioned \"I like eating ice\" and in the middle of my sentence she cut me of like \"no one cares\" with that face shes done before that means \"stop talking about YOUR disordered eating or YOU working out, I dont want to hear it\" but I never do?  All I literally said was \"yeah I was eating the ice from my water because I like ice, even though it hurts my gums because I have sensitive teeth\" and she cut me off before I continued with the gum part.  I literally never talk about my disordered eating or workout.  Except today I talking to my other friend in a gc that was including B.  And I talked intermittent fasting, how \"I do that\", how I have a late breakfast, etc.  And then she send me that hours later.\n\nSo I'm triggered and mad so I send that grouochat 3 videos.  I dont know I'm freaking stupid and act like a baby my ed brain twists things.\n\nI sent a japanese breakfast prep video.  And british breakfast video.  And a 10000 calorie british breakfast challenge.  And I wrote: \"I was watching videos on japanese breakfast and it looks so much more wholesome and healthier than British or your stereotypical american breakfast.  Like if i had to eat the british breakfast I'd die, its so.... stale, the family aas just eatind cereal, snd jam on toast.  Which isnt bad i uess but compared to the healthier japanese breakfast???\" And \"that 10000 calories is a 3lb gain right there\"\n\nWhich is EXACTLY what I used to say on off times back in may/june.  \n\nNow I've gotten back into my habits where I just dont eat until dinner and can ignore my appetite so I'm going to lose so much weight, be as skinny as her, make her feel bad.  I feel toxic.  Maybe I am toxic.  My ed has made me into a toxic person.  I dont think I can ever recover with her around.\n\nDoes anyone else get triggered by the most innocent of things?  I even told her months ago \"when people talk about their diet or workout it makes me want to starve myself, and I do\" and I'm mad at her for not listening but also I cant control her life or what she talks about, idk.\n\nShe also once said my butt got thicker over the summer and I restricted low for the next 3 days.  She said shed be there for me.  And were going to see a movie next Thursday, I'll be restricting until then, and when I go with her I'm not eating anything just to shove that in her face.

This is seriously the best community on the internet. \n\nAfter a couple of drinks last night I finally brought it up and he was like \u201cWhat? No I didn\u2019t say that!

I\u2019m sorry if it hurt your feelings, you\u2019re really beautiful and if I did say it I didn\u2019t mean it.

And the most awful thing of it is: I am painfully aware of my actions but unable to do anything to make changes in order to be the good friend and daughter. \nIt feels like being paralysed and unable to make any move whilst being tortured.  But also have paralysed myself cause it feels like these are my own actions. \n\nI always thought I was in control of everything (clich\u00e9 yeah). So this realisation of me being so far removed from any form of control over my life or my actions, is actually damn frightening and devastating. Like I have been living in a lie and finally sense a spark of truth (ok let\u2019s not get carried away on the philosophical train here). \n\nAll I have to do is hop on a train, take an 1,5hr ride and stay the weekend at my parents and visit my friend and her baby in my hometown. \nBut the fear of having to eat while staying at my parents is too much. They know all about my ED, but I do not want to push the sick behaviours of fasting and overexercising in their faces. It will make them too worried and I cannot live with that. \n\nIf anyone in this community has some spare energy (chances are slight, I know) to share some soothing words, I would be forever grateful. &lt;3", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I got a response to that video that had a great perspective on when that paradigm might be useful:\n\n\u201cDefinitely useful as a stepping stone. I think it\u2019s a bit much to ask someone who is afraid of eating food to immediately let go of any negative associations and start thinking of food as a joyful thing. \u2018Food is fuel\u201d is a value-neutral statement\u2014food isn\u2019t good or bad, it\u2019s just energy for your body. This objective fact is very useful for combating the negative thoughts surrounding food which are very subjective feelings. Eventually someone will probably want to work up to actually enjoying food, but it\u2019s easier to go from food is bad -&gt; food is fuel -&gt; food is pleasurable than it is to go immediately from food is bad -&gt; food is good. Changes in thinking are more likely to stick when you take baby steps.\u201d\n\nI thought this was a really good point. Cognitively, I split recovery up into early, middle, and long-term recovery because I there are so many tools that may be useful in one phase that may no longer serve us somewhere down the road, or may even become harmful. A couple examples I can think of off the top of my head are thinking of food as fuel like I talked about earlier, or making a rule for yourself that you don\u2019t go to a party if alcohol will be there.\n\nThere is definitely a phase of recovery where having a rule like this protects you against relapse. But two, or three, or four years later, maybe there\u2019s a significant celebration like a New Year\u2019s Eve party or a family member\u2019s birthday where there also happens to be a trigger food or drink (alcohol) And maybe that rule no longer serves you, maybe the connection with family becomes more important. Obviously, avoiding a relapse is the most important priority in addiction recovery. But if you practice regularly flexing your recovery muscles, you might find that refusing alcohol at a party has somehow shifted from a monumental effort of will to an easy, \u201cNo, thanks!\u201d\n\nAs an analogy, casting a broken leg is essential for early healing. However, at a certain point in time, the cast needs to come off for the leg to regain its strength. [In this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwgpqTSGaxI) I talk about how certain tools, like a plaster cast on a broken leg, can be essential to early recovery but may not serve you as you progress into the increasing freedoms of long-term recovery from eating disorders or other addictions. Please recognize that this is only my opinion and may not apply to your unique recovery journey. May you find peace in recovery, whatever that looks like to you.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I don't have to deal with a crazy lady full of anger because you get a better wage than her, you do something better than her, you are not hated by everyone like her and so on.\nNobody shames me if I want to eat something.\nNobody shames me for my hobbies, likes and dislikes, body, accent, whatever.\nI don't think I ever felt so relieved.\nMy binges have gone down considerably. I have started a routine: I cook everything (or nearly everything) on Sunday. \nThe only things I leave until the night prior are accompaniments for the main food that I will be taking with me at work.\nYesterday I had a small binge where I had 2 kebabs, 1 portion of chips and 3 slices of quesadillia in the evening, the difference is that when I was having the second kebab I was able to stop and not eat the spring rolls and chilli bites that I have bought. It might look like a small victory but it was a big one for me. \nToday me and my partner had a small fight I went to lidl and got cake and brandy cream. I had only a tiny slice of the cake with a spoonful of cream instead of having the whole lot. \nI don't feel the urge to binge at the moment, I don't feel the need to numb my feelings because I feel guilty or they are too painful. \nI have the right to feel upset. I should not be ashamed of feeling upset for something small. It might be small for everyone else but it was important to me, this feeling it's okay.\nIt makes me sad thinking that I couldn't feel and properly own my emotions and feelings for fear of someone's retaliation. Over the years I grew up in and psychological abusive family, I have suffered also physical abuse for a few months (or one year, I am not sure since I was little and probably removed most of the memory of it). Every time I tried to say and externate my feelings I was told to be the better person, not to be hateful, that other people had it worse, that my abusers had other things going on their mind and I should stay calm and act as if nothing happened. \nI have become as a stress ball: you can squeeze it, throw it at things, leave it unused for ages, and it will always be there maintaining its shape, maybe a bit uglier, a bit older, with all the tears and bits falling off but it will be there until you throw it away.\nI think I am changing my purpose.\nI am no more a stress ball, I am becoming me, again, a human being.\nWith all my emotions and resiliency, with my strength and weakness. It's a journey. And I am starting slowly. \nBut at every turn, at every red light, at every accidents along the road I will become a bit more human and a bit less stress ball.\nSorry for rumbling away. I just wanted to share this with you people\n\nTl;dr: I am becoming a human being instead of a stress ball. That's the secret.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I\u2019m scared.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I just got out of a PRTF this past Wednesday. I was there for other reasons not related to the ED. But they discharged me because they felt I needed to be getting ED specific help. This is the first time anyone has ever acknowledged the ED. I\u2019ve tried to keep it under wraps for years. Anyways, while at the PRTF I kept losing weight. I became underweight for the third time. So they referred me to this ED specialized program. But the thing is, I\u2019ve been out of the PRTF for about 3.5 days now and all I\u2019ve done is binge. I gained 7 pounds. All in 3.5 days. I\u2019m a fucking land whale. I am no longer underweight. I hate myself so much. I can barely stand to look in the mirror and at the scale without crying. I\u2019m terrified that the people doing the eval will see that I\u2019m not underweight anymore and then therefore think I don\u2019t need help. Or that I\u2019m too fat for anything other than regular out patient therapy. But then the other scary thing is- if I do get accepted, I\u2019ll definitely be the fattest person there. And what if I refuse meals? What will they do? What if I start losing weight again(that\u2019s my goal), will they kick me out? Because I know it\u2019s so much easier for me to restrict and starve myself if I\u2019m not at home. Because then I don\u2019t have unlimited access to food. If I lived alone, only veggies and some fruit would be in my fridge. \n\n \n\nI\u2019m also scared that I\u2019m going to break down in front of them and basically beg them for help. I don\u2019t want anyone to see me like that. That would be one ugly and embarrassing site to see. But what if I do the opposite of that and barley say anything and just shut down inside of myself? Then I really won\u2019t get help and I\u2019ll be wasting their time. \n\n  \n\nI\u2019ve felt so out of control, stressed, and fat as fuck these past few days. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I was thinking of self harming again last night. But on my thighs so my parents won\u2019t get suspicious of me covering my arms all day like I used to before I went to the PRTF. But I ended up falling asleep instead since I was actually tired at a reasonable time for once. I actually just finished another binge a little bit ago. I\u2019ve had lax tea every day since I got out. And yesterday, wow my intestines were not having it. I thought I was going to cry while on the toilet last night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I was binging today, I thought about how maybe I should just kill myself. Only been out of the PRTF for 3 days and I\u2019m already falling down the drain. At this point, what even is the point? I\u2019m a fat, ugly blob.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m asking in this post. I\u2019m just on the edge right now and I can\u2019t deal with it any longer.\n\n Have any of you felt like this and been in this predicament before? How did it go for you?

Like last year my anxiety was the absolute worst it\u2019s ever been because of a health scare and being so anxious I lost like 35 pounds from the anxiety making me nauseous and I couldn\u2019t barely eat as much maybe like a meal a day. Then once I kinda got it under control like 6-7 months later and was put on this medication I started eating more again and eating a lot. It\u2019s so bad! Usually I\u2019ll do okay till mid afternoon and then it really hits me in the evening and before bed when I eat the most all at once. It\u2019s like I\u2019ll eat a sandwich, then a piece or two of cheese, a yogurt and then maybe even a bowl of cereal or a snack cake/dessert literally all within like 45 minutes. \n\nI feel so bad like this stupid binge eating was the whole problem why I had anxiety because when I was on anxiety medication for the first time up until a few months before my anxiety was bad I gained weight from that too and I guess too much causing pre diabetes and causing me to go into a huge panic thinking that was it and I had diabetes for sure. So I got so anxious I lost weight pretty fast from being too nervous to eat as much any more.  And I\u2019m scared because of this medication it\u2019s gonna cause me to keep binging and then I might actually get diabetes this time if I don\u2019t stop either binging some how or get off of this medication or something soon enough like I did last time when I caught myself before it was too late. \n\nDoes anyone have some tips or something on what to do please I\u2019m so scared I won\u2019t ever be able to lose weight and keep it off.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I decided I was gonna make my diet healthier (not that it was particularly unhealthy in the first place) and I decided to cut all refined/added sugar from my diet for a week and see what it was like. At this stage I was having porridge or a smoothie for breakfast, cooked something like rice and veggies for lunch, and then a home cooked dinner for tea, but no dessert. I tried to eat only when I was hungry, as I was conscious of eating out of boredom before. Btw I\u2019m fairly active, 166cm and roughly 58kg. It\u2019s just kinda spiralled downwards from there, I\u2019ve become much more restrictive of my portion sizes and what I eat. Still trying to eat only when hungry. Eating less at dinner which my parents noticed, but I brushed it off saying \u201cI\u2019m just not that hungry\u201d. These past few weeks I\u2019ve been eating maybe a piece of fruit for breakfast, perhaps a cornthin or two with peanut butter for lunch and another piece of fruit, then restricting my portion at dinner time, but having a wee bit of dessert. I\u2019m becoming more aware of how many calories I\u2019m eating, and if I ate \u201ctoo much\u201d one day, I would restrict the day after. I\u2019m also suffering from a lot of food guilt after eating, and trying to keep track of what I\u2019m eating throughout the day. If I do want to eat like a piece of cake or something I \u201cjustify\u201d it by going on a walk or some exercise. I\u2019m also starting to watch a lot of food recipes on YouTube, or just look at food or r/baking. \nI just want to escape this unhealthy cycle, but my mind is trapping me. I\u2019m scared of putting on weight. I\u2019m not doing this to look attractive for anyone, just to be comfortable in my body. It\u2019s not working. I think it stems from a lack of self confidence but I don\u2019t know how to go back to how I was, not tracking what I was eating, eating what I wanted when I wanted and not feeling overwhelming guilt about it. \nPlease help.\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t know if this is related, but I\u2019ve been finding that my vision is blacking out more easily when I stand up too quickly recently, and feeling dizzy. \nMy period is also very irregular, but it was fairy irregular before all this started as well :|", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I wasn't binging/purging or restricting, and I felt like everything was going okay.\n\nThen in November, work started piling on and I started stress eating, and no longer had the time to make thoughtful decisions about what I ate.  I got into an argument with my new bf and I ended the relationship, because I hurt him and he didn't deserve it, and I didn't deserve him. \n\nAnd now work is still stressful, and I have to rely on OTHER PEOPLE to get my job done (nature of the job).  On top of that I'm fucking single and it's the holiday season, and I want to hide in my apartment because seeing happy couples makes me want to cry, and all I want if for my ex to just hold me forever.  Then after work, I spend $20-40 on UberEats just to binge and purge the food, and occasionally drink myself to sleep, because I can't deal with myself and my thoughts when I'm sober, and I'm anxious before I sleep because of work.   \n\nAnd I tried to get my ex back just by talking, but I ended up getting drunk half way through talking to him, so he probably knows he's better off being without me because why the fuck would you want to be with someone who literally cannot control what they put into their mouth (alcohol or food or w/e)\n\nSo every night when I'm ordering food, I just wonder how normal people have stressful jobs and eat like normal human beings.  I have a therapist, and he's great and I trust him, but I know that recovering is something that I need to put the effort into, but instead I want someone to smack me until I end up recovering.

Not rly looking forward to it, since I've seen my doc on my own since I was like 14, (almost 21 now), and I don't even know if I can manage being in the same room during it all cuz its so difficult. But I understand that its necessary, and I might have to since I'm over 16...\n\nIf my doc doesn't have any better treatment options, that is actually helpful AND manageable, then I guess I'll just quit all treatment together, and just focus on myself, and my family, and I guess just get comfortable with the thought that it probably will kill me sooner or later, or I kms when I can't take it anymore.\n\nMaybe by focusing on myself and my family and things that gives my life meaning for once, maybe my eating disorder could go over by itself, but I can't really count on it.\n\nAt least I don't want to waste more time on pointless shit and being frustrated about not getting help or being understood, or managing to get better on my own. \n\nI've already wasted almost 21 yrs on just, trauma, family tragedies, being mentally and physically and chronically ill. I just want a life, and I'll take whatever I can get, if my only life is one without being able to eat, but still to some extent enjoy spending time with my family and enjoy them a few more years, then I guess that's what I'm gonna do.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not gonna pay 35 EUR a week over new year on them asking me what my BMI is (With no good reason to know it other than just them being nosy and curious) and talking to a psychiatrist FOR me with me NOT EVEN BEING there, and them forcing folders with information about MY diagnosis that I've lived with for years/ my entire life and probably know more about than both them AND their folders do. \n\nAnd them reading cringe-worthy unhelpful book quotes and them saying \"it gets better\" and comparing my situation to other people they've spoken to before, as if I'm just a ware and not a person of my own. Just for themselves to feel better when they know they're incompetent to help me and just wants to keep their job.\n\nIt doesn't help. \n\nAnd them not even helping me setting up a plan, or coping skills, or even refer me to someone or somewhere that CAN help. like, why even bother??\n\nI honestly just want to close this chapter of my life, and not think too much about my past anymore, and just focus on the now. It just this fucking ED that's ruining it all for me.\n\nI can live with anxiety, avpd, Asperger, scoliosis, depression, IBS and the list continues, now when I know I'm financially secure, and I can just focus on as I said, my health, things that gives me joy, and my family, which is my biggest anchor and reason that I'm alive today. \n\nBut this ED just isolates me even from my family, and any event, and I can't even enjoy food, which I used to, and in a complicated way still love...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--------------\n\nI just want a life.\n\nMy only three wishes in life is, that my little family and I have long, stable and as joyful lives we can after everything that has happened. And that we stay as close as we are now for many years to come.\n\nThat I could get myself a permanent home, maybe look into some kind of service dog or something in the future. Maybe even get a partner or re-connect more with old friends I haven't seen in a long time.\n\nAnd being able to fucking eat, and enjoy a fucking burger again, without purging, getting anxiety, feeling shame, having to excersize and cry and having meltdowns. To just, invite my sister on sleep-overs and we could make tacos again, or enjoying a barbecue with my grandma, or what ever. And have a healthy relationship, not binge on shit food and become obese again..", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

I\u2019m not \u201cblaming\u201d my spouse at all, but he was a big meat eater and I ate meat at the time. \n\nSince he passed, the depression hit hard first, and due to laziness, and the fact that he did most of the cooking (being far better at it than me and enjoying doing it), I stopped eating meat at home. I would still eat it if I ate out. \n\nA year later, I stopped working (burnout) and stopped eating out so wasn\u2019t eating meat and not missing it. I gradually subconsciously stopped eating all animal products. I lost over 20% of my originally healthy weight. \n\nMy B12 plummetted to half the minimum required for a deficiency diagnosis. In the last 3 months I have had chronic nausea (no, not pregnant) and haven\u2019t been able to eat much. My B12 dropped again and I lost another 10% of weight to put me now underweight with low body fat. \n\nI otherwise eat a vegan diet with mostly fruits ans vegetables and will make muffins in a mug in a microwave (ya you can do that!) occasionally when I\u2019m not lazy. I haven\u2019t been taking the B12 supplements regularly because they increase my nausea, anxiety and insomnia. My ferritin level is now below normal too. \n\nI told my psych it was probably part stomach ulcer and partly psychosomatic but he disagreed and said I needed to see a specialist. I have not, because the nausea is not as bad now but I still have less appetite and to be honest, it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nThose who restrict heavily, do you have a major b12 deficiency, and do you take supplements for it and do you have any effects from it? (ie nausea, anxiety, insomnia?) I\u2019ve read posts and articles about people with 4-5x my B12 levels wth serious symptoms but I don\u2019t feel like I have many.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

Except now I have full blown BED bc I literally don't know how to eat normally anymore.\n\nI run anywhere between 8 and 16 miles a day to justify sitting down for meals that are 2000+ calories, which puts me at a deficit during the week, but the binge urges are SO BAD that on days I don't work out (usually the weekend), I still binge (like, almost 4000 calories a day), and if I don't purge, I end up feeling sick and bloated and just all around awful.\n\nI need this to stop.

Maybe that way I can only run for an hour and ten minutes instead of 2+. My TDEE is 1750 when I'm sedentary, but I usually am to get back to 1450 with exercise purging so that I have SOME sort of deficit for the weekend. And then I fast all day Friday until dinner, which I purge, and I think it's that one day plus my deficit that has me losing weight? But I'm exhausted and I need to stop giving myself excuses to binge.\n\nSo here I am! Beyond nervous but so sick of living my life this way.

{"post_id": "e8e5wc", "created_utc": 1575917512, "title": "Mom enables my binging!! HELP :(", "author": "elentiyafae", "self_text": "Before I get into my problem, I want to give some background information. I\u2019m a 15 year old girl and I\u2019ve struggled with binge eating and other eating disorders since I was 13, and I\u2019ve realized I have a very real sugar addiction (don\u2019t we all tbh?). My mom knows about this and I\u2019ve expressed what I\u2019m going through very clearly to my family. I\u2019m at a normal weight- 5\u20197 and about 145 pounds right now. Usually I am good at controlling my weight, but since school has started it\u2019s been hard. I\u2019ve gained about ten pounds because of binge eating and depression. I always beg my mother to stop buying junk food and stop feeding me so much, and she always agrees to help me at first and it lasts for about a week before she goes back to buying nutella and other huge trigger foods and frying potatoes at 7 pm for some reason. I have 4 younger siblings she I guess that\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t want to stop buying junk food, because it\u2019s easier to do that then to beg them to eat fruits and vegetables. She usually just says \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to eat no one\u2019s forcing you just tell me no\u201d LIKE MA\u2019AM I HAVE. A FOOD ADDICTION. of course i WANT to eat. that\u2019s the fucking PROBLEM!!! Another thing is, I don\u2019t know why but as soon as I wake up she makes me go eat and as soon as I\u2019m home from school she tells me to eat dinner with such urgency and I don\u2019t understand it. It\u2019s as if the food is going to disappear. This doesn\u2019t help at all. I\u2019ve had huge emotional breakdowns in front of my mother and I\u2019ve had to stay home from school a couple of times because of how much I hurt my stomach by binging to the point where it hurt to move. She always hugs me and comforts me by saying prayers over me and wiping my tears but that\u2019s really not what I need. I love my mom but I can\u2019t help but feel so angry at her sometimes. Actually, a lot. I feel so angry at her a lot of the times. I send her articles about binge eating disorder so she can understand me better and I beg her to make sacrifices for me like to stop buying junk food (I even try to reason with her not just by talking about health reasons but also the fact that we\u2019re struggling financially and she tries to hide this fact and just blows a bunch of money on snacks every week) but I keep having to constantly face these food struggles every day and hope to have enough will power to resist all the sugar around me. But if you struggle with BED you know that being around sugar is like an alcoholic being in a house full of alcoholic drinks. I feel like no one is using their fucking brains. And it\u2019s not only about me. I care about everyone\u2019s overall health. Even my little siblings snack excessively and eat spoonfuls of nutella on bread and bowls of cereal in the morning before school. And when I\u2019m binging or just overeating I do this too. No one stops me. Everyone encourages it if anything. I can\u2019t rely on myself every time to stop myself because willpower is limited. DOES NO ONE UNDERSTAND HOW BAD THIS SHIT IS. I need to eat a fucking vegetable. I shouldn\u2019t have to beg my mom to care about her kids\u2019 health. It doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m the oldest and don\u2019t want to influence my little siblings with my bad behavior because NO ONE deserves to witness someone they love always in the act of binge eating, it\u2019s just disgusting and miserable. It also doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m constantly stressing about school and needing to get good grades. And the fact that my dad is in another country working to get money so he really doesn\u2019t know about the problems I have and when he comes to visit he will expect me to be normal and healthy and getting perfect grades. But instead I\u2019m binge eating everyday and neglecting my studies. Everyone tells me they\u2019re there for me but then comes and feeds me fucking oreos literally 5 minutes after I\u2019ve opened up about my sugar addiction like HELLO??? every time I talk to someone about my eating habits whether it\u2019s my friend or my mom or my older sister (who is in uni and doesn\u2019t live at home with us) I feel like I\u2019m shouting into a void and no one is receiving my message. I\u2019m so scared I\u2019ll become overweight again. I keep gaining weight and it needs to stop asap. I\u2019ve been trying so hard to stop this by eating full balanced meals and healthy snacks but after a couple days to a week or a bit more if I\u2019m lucky, my binging habits always wins due to stress or pressure and I spiral downwards into a nightmarish hell of binge eating and get into another cycle that lasts days to weeks. I feel so alone and everyone tells me I\u2019m not but they don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have BED. People help me when it comes to depression but when it comes to food issues no one has a clue, and it makes me feel so alone. I apologize this got so long, but I really just needed to vent. PS Im not putting all the blame on my family. I\u2019m aware that taking full responsibility is the only thing that will make me recover. But I need help from the woman raising me sometimes too.. She is setting me up for failure every day, and I resist and resist as much as I can but it gets to be too hard all on my own.

And then, when I was 15 yo I've decided to lose some weight because I thought that I would accepted, that people would like me more. I went from 163lbs to 127lbs in 2 monts (mind you, im 164cm tall). Back then I haven't really noticed it, but looking back I've realised that at that time I have developed body dysmorphia and a few eating disorders as well. However, I was constantly in a stage of denial, I believed that nothing was wrong with me, exept, of course, my body weight. I restricted my food intake too much (800cal, or less), fasted for a day and then went on 10km runs, started to binge and right after had overwhelming guilt and then threw up.. I was never happy with myself, ever. That went on for 4 years, and I've managed to maintain my 127lbs, but my mental health just kept getting worse.  \nAs I finished high school and moved to another city and got into uni things got out of control. I was depressed, self harming, going in and out of toxic relationships, just overall despising myself. And then I snapped. I binged, but this time I didn't throw up. The thing was, I just kept eating away my feelings and went from 127lbs to 187 in a year. I really didn't care, until one day I looked at my old clothes and tried to put them on, and boy, I was shocked. I knew that I gained weight, but that entire year felt like one very long binging episode, like I was there, but actually wasn't.  \nAt 21, I moved to another city, got into new uni, you know, had a new start. Slowly, I've managed to lose weight. I went from 187lbs to 146. But the thing is, even though I'm trying my hardest, I cannot have a healthy relationship with my body and food. My body dysmorphia is hitting in again, and every damn time I look myself in the mirror I see the same fat person. I'm nitpicking every single little thing that I don't like on my body. I am eating healthy portions (1500cal), and avoiding shitty, triggering foods for the most part, I'm working out etc. I still slip up sometimes, once or twice a month and binge, and then immediately throw up everything. \n\nRight now, I'm just trying to figure out how to overcome body dysmorphia and binge-purge, followed by a guilt trip, habit. These issues have been with me since I was 15, and now I am 22 and I don't want to allow these things to rule my life anymore. If anyone has any advice, please share.

She said, \"you have a weak mind and youre being really stupid.\" So i walked away and said its okay to myself. Well i went about my day and recently ive been on a bread craze! I just looovee bread so thats a majority of what ive been eating. Anyway, i come back from school and eat a pastry (bread) the way ive grown comfortable eating it. Laying down and watching yt to prevent me from compulsive exersicing or compensation. She comes into my room and says, \"there you fucking are again on the bed, then youre complaining cause your belly swells up like a hippo.\" I was shocked because i previously mentioned how much it hurt when she made comments like that. So it goes; \nMe: Are you serious?! \nHer (realising her mistake): no nevermind \n: You are! Oh my god youre serious! I cant believe you!( i jump out of bed and start bawling my eyes out. So i run into the bathroom and cry for a good 30 minutes. \n\nShe starts talking with my older brother(hes the only one that understands) and sister about the pastry craze ive been on and says its my fault because i dont choose a salad. Then she comes into the bathroom and tell me to shut up and its my fault. \n\n\"You dont understand! I asked you three times to stop making those comments because you guys dont understand. Dont you see how much it hurts me, you guys think its so fucking easy and it hurts so much. It really hurts.\" \n\nIve been crying and trying not to purge (not a trigger for me ive only ever restricted unless you count exercize----nvm it is a problem) for the past hour. \n\nMy mom and my older sister think its all my fault they blame me for not excersing away my guilt and not making healthier choices.

[Long, sorry]", "author": "icetesseracts", "self_text": "I've had an eating disorder for over ten years, and I've been actively trying to recover on and off for at least 8 of those years. I've seen dozens of psychiatrists and therapists. I did IOP. I tried every option for \"DIY recovery\" out there (apps, workbooks, etc). I want to get that out of the way first - I've used every resource at my disposal that I am willing and able to access.\n\nI just realized this week that, for the first time since I was 13 years old, I have managed to maintain one normal, healthy weight (well, a 10lb range) for an entire year. I'm feeling all sorts of mixed feelings about that, especially since I'm not fond of the weight, but it cannot be denied - that is a HUGE step for recovery for me. \n\nAnd I was reflecting on that, trying to identify what has made this success, such as it is, possible. And I've realized that I have really thrown myself into... I'm basically on this quest to be The Lady Who Seems Like She Has Her Shit Together. You all know what I mean. The lady who seems to be acing this whole adulting thing without even having to try. Never misses a workout. Meal preps healthy meals every week, but doesn't turn down a tasty treat because it all fits into her whole balanced, healthy lifestyle. Keeps her apartment spotlessly clean and organized at all times. Has a pretty bullet journal and uses it religiously. Has creative hobbies. Meditates. Goes out with friends. Always looks put-together, with a cohesive aesthetic, but in a natural, not-trying-too-hard kind of way. All super healthy stuff, right?\n\nWell, all those years of therapy have given me at least some insight into what my eating disorder is \"about.\" And we all know it's a big, ugly mess of a thousand different things and I'm no different, but there are at least two major \"factors\" of my eating disorder - Competition and Control. I have to be The Best, I have to be Perfect, and I have to maintain a white-knuckled grip of control over myself at all times. In an eating disordered context, that means I had to be The Thinnest Person In The Room at all times, I had to have iron control over my body and my intake. \n\nBut as I was reflecting, I realized that my current strides towards recovery have been made possible by the fact that I just have a new outlet for my desperate, gnawing, all-consuming need to Be Perfect. A friend made a comment the other day, \"Oh right, you meal prep, because you have your life together and shit,\" and I rode that high for *weeks*. I'm grinning just typing it out. And I realized that it's the same kind of sick glee that I used to feel when people would comment about how skinny I was.\n\nOn the one hand, \"replace destructive behaviors and coping mechanisms with constructive ones\" is like, a basic tenet of therapy and recovery. I've definitely done that. Gold star for me. There's definitely something to be said for what I've accomplished there, especially since it took me ten years to do it. And I've used my newfound zeal for a healthy lifestyle to correct disordered urges more than once.\n\nOn the other hand, I definitely haven't solved the Underlying Issues. I haven't solved the need to Be Perfect, I just have a new definition of \"Perfect.\" I still hate my body, and myself in general, so much that it makes me sick if I think about it too long. In some ways, I think I might just be... distracting myself from it. \n\nBut then again, I'm the healthiest I've been in a decade. My healthy eating hasn't veered into orthorexia, my workouts haven't veered into over-exercising, my cleaning hasn't turned into scrubbing the baseboards with a toothbrush, etc. All of my behavior is well within normal limits. I'm also the happiest I've ever been, for whatever that's worth. I mean, if this is as good as it gets... I could probably live with this.\n\nAnd I also don't know how much of this is Problematic Underlying Issues and how much is just... me. I'm *very* high-strung, and I have been since infancy. It may not be the most desirable trait in a human being, but... **I don't know if I'm pathologizing normal behavior... or if I'm normalizing unhealthy behavior.** \n\nSHIT, this is long and I'm rambling. If anybody has read this far, I'm sorry.\n\n**TL;DR - Is objectively healthy behavior really healthy if it's stemming from the same place as an ED? Do I need to solve the underlying issues to achieve \"real recovery?\" Are the underlying issues even issues, or are they just part of my personality?**", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I think subconsciously I do things to limit my control step by step because I know I really want to binge. By the time your home with the open food already in touching your lips, that is when your control is most limited. But when I was at the store, I went through self checkout and felt so much  shame about what I was buying and what I was about to do and how I was about to treat myself that I didn\u2019t even want the complete strangers around me to look at me. I wanted to shrink and disappear. Immediately after the purchase I regretted it and felt sick about it. I already hated myself for it and I hadn\u2019t even taken a bite. When I got home I decided the only way I could really make a point to myself, and reclaim my body for the evening was to throw everything I had just bought in the dumpster. I didn\u2019t put it in the pantry for later. I didn\u2019t throw it away in my kitchen trash. I went out to my back yard and put it in the dumpster. I don\u2019t know if it will be, but I hope this may be a turning point for me. I\u2019ve never actually done anything like this before. But I know shit food makes me feel like shit.

Senior year I was turning 17 and pursuing a girl I liked. She didn't really pay attention to me when I was overweight, but when I got skinny she and I got along better. So we start going out and I'm in the throes of an ED, restrictive AN. Even looking back on it now is somewhat triggering (I used to dish out on trigger warnings, not anymore..).\n\nI've always been a very independent person, but in the process of trying to figure out what society wanted from me senior, I had very warped perceptions of myself. I'm a dude who straight up called myself ugly (even though you couldn't really say I was) but was perfectly fine with it because I had such a strong ego. This changes senior year once I try to think through how to integrate myself better into society.  So I start looking up male models, because that must be society's ideal, right? (I mean face wise sure, but Brady's jacked and he's definitely a more ideal man).  They're all thin and lanky, I'm stocky and have love handles. I have a good build for sports which I actually underappreciated because I was lazy.\n\n**Trigger Warning (bringing up numbers):**\n\nI started of at 160/165 pounds, but looked hilariously overweight- like couldn't even look down to see my feet (this was probably just because I had no muscle). I took pride in this initially (as you should) because it seems I'm surpassing my father and I'm destined for great heights. But I started hearing bad advice and start thinking I should lose some weight because I want to get laid. I lose around 35-40 pounds and wake up every morning weighing around 128-130 pounds after around 3 months of dieting and sleep weighing a little less than that.  All of this starts the summer of 2017. I couldn't honestly tell you what happened then because I don't remember. I'm 5'10.5 at that age with broad shoulders and long, muscular limbs. I was and still am a late bloomer so I look like a sophomore (and this isn't self-validation, a junior straight up told me to vote for the sophomore class council once)\n\nI love my parents to death but they were straight up uneducated and in denial about my ED, but my mom did pull through and validate me enough by the end of the year (which is when my birthday is), so I started gaining weight slowly but surely and I'm all good but with some gastrointestinal issues that I brush off as puberty (which is true but I deluded myself out of my eating disorder lol). At this point, half way through 2018 I'm up to 140/145 which is a safe weight, but I do start eating a lot of shit junk food which felt great.\n\nI break up with my girlfriend in march of 2018, but I didn't see any value in the relationship and am so void of feeling that it doesn't really weigh on my mind. So all is good until December of 2018 when I realize I have not grown. Even at age of 17  I grow 1.5/2 inches a year, but I'm 18 now and I've only grown 3/4 an inch (yeah I know most people don't grow this late anyways, but I'm expected to get to 6'2/6'4). Something is wrong. At this point I'm in college and utterly confused by the world around me. I grew being a very genuine person but started hiding that and long story short I get super super jaded. I go to an ivy league college and the difference in life style turned my world upside down. I lose the heart of who I am and here I am two years later. Utterly jaded and unproductive because of two reasons.\n\n1. I realize what a waste of time my past was and how many underlying psychological issues I had as a result of my environment and being left out to guide myself from a very young age with very toxic dynamics surrounding my family and my identity. (I'm a 1.5 generation immigrant) I feel utterly broken. And I realize how much I've been blessed but how much I've wasted my blessings. I'm 6'0 at 19 and hope I'm still growing, but I'm still in despair even knowing how much I'm still blessed with (I'm not calling 6'0 tall, but it's not a bad height lol)\n2. I told my family I had OCD in 8th grade, but they don't believe me and make up stories to justify it as a normal, good thing. (Side note: everyone has OCD to a certain degree, but my belief on mental illnesses is that they are neurological cycles that blocks people from seeing the real you and lets them see only the neurologically ingrained patterns that aren't a result of your own free will). I get OCD like behavior about how much height I've lost and everyday is that same: I hope I don't start thinking about height again.\n\nI'm definitely being a bitch about things. I feed a lot of wood to the fire of my already self-destructive tendencies through calculating how much height I've lost out on or my relative evolutionary success.  I'm an extremely competitive person, so that's one part of my problem, but how do I move past these two meaningless years in my life psychologically?  How do I fix cope with my longstanding issues that are only clear now once I'm allowed to truly be myself?\n\nSorry if this is a bit ranty but I can't even talk about these issues with my closest friend who is my height and clearly thinking rationally but is also a lot more secure in his identity. Also in terms of girls, I doubt my height would matter unless I wanted to date some 6'2 girl, but again competitive to a fault.\n\nI'm a 200 pound thickboi now (and believe it or not leaner than when I was dieting)- I stay committed to things I start for better or worse. I'm really interested in things for the first time in my life ( like basketball-for which height is important, so not the best move on my part) and really want to turn a new leaf.\n\nEDIT: Asked a doctor and said I probably didn't fuck myself but feels bad not being a tall boi either way.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I used to have a negative body image when I was 14-16 but looking back I know I wasn\u2019t \u201cfat\u201d and now I definitely don\u2019t think that. Growing up I ate a lot of the same foods due to financial circumstances (ate a lot of chicken rice beans bread pasta etc) and I find myself now (20) only liking similar foods. \n\nWhen I came to college 2 1/2 years ago I lost weight, not a lot in terms of hard numbers, but a lot for me since I\u2019ve always been on the low side of a healthy BMI. I became underweight and I noticed a difference in my body. It started I think because I absolutely couldn\u2019t eat in the dining hall around other people. I thought it was first week anxiety (I\u2019ve struggled with anxiety my whole life) and I could only choke down vegetables and fruit for the beginning few weeks without becoming nauseous. I didn\u2019t have any conscious anxiety about eating in front of people but I figured that was the only thing that made sense since I didn\u2019t want to be thinner. \n\nOver the two years of being on campus I struggled to eat enough. I never ate breakfast, I\u2019d pick at lunch and dinner usually becoming \u201cfull\u201d after a few bites and nauseous after attempting to eat anything except my safe foods like vegetables fruit steak chicken breast. I was repulsed when I entered the dining hall and lost all appetite. When I left I\u2019d get hungry again but it came to a point where I\u2019d get too hungry to eat since I\u2019d become nauseous. Sometimes I would \u201cbinge\u201d (idek if that\u2019s the right word I was kinda just eating a moderate amount but it was more than I ate all day) at night on the stuff I could have in my dorm like ramen and chips and refried beans but even in my own dorm I would get nauseous and stomach issues after a few bites. The only time I was relieved was when I was high, I started in college and used it more and more literally just to gain the ability to eat. Friends were concerned I had an ED and my family noticed my weight loss. But I\u2019ve never had the negative body image associated with anorexia nervosa I don\u2019t like being this skinny, I look like a child and my curves are nonexistent. \n\nI moved into my own apartment in August and I was super excited since I\u2019ve always wanted to be able to control what I ate since I\u2019ve always been picky. I started to like cooking and I make meals for me and my boyfriend every day but I\u2019m not gaining any weight. I still get full super quickly and almost never finish a plate. I don\u2019t have the nausea problem now unless I\u2019m at a meeting or event where I\u2019m anxious for other reasons, especially since I stick to cooking foods I know I\u2019ll want. But if my boyfriend doesn\u2019t ask me to make him food I won\u2019t really make myself food. I\u2019ve gotten used to the stomach growling of being hungry and I just kind of sit with it for a while and don\u2019t have the motivation to eat anything. I\u2019ve never in my whole life could eat In the first few hours of being awake and so if I wake up late (usually do) I won\u2019t feel that I \u201ccan\u201d eat until the afternoon and I\u2019ll often realize I haven\u2019t eaten all day at like 6, 7 pm. I work at a fast casual restaurant and will sneak little bites of food cause I\u2019m hungry like a little cube of steak and some bacon and some wonton strips. But when I come home I will do everything I need to do like clean the apartment do the dishes put a load of laundry in, take a shower, etc before I start making anything because it\u2019s past a point where I\u2019m just used to the hunger. \n\nI think I\u2019m doing better and so does my boyfriend since I eat lunch and dinner most days and I snack a lot in the middle of the night but I can\u2019t help but wonder since I\u2019m not gaining the weight back and I still don\u2019t have the appetite I used to have if something is wrong. I know this was long, but I\u2019ve never found a good answer and it\u2019s been affecting me for far too long. I saw the school nurse once and she referred me to a nutritionist and it was literally the least helpful thing ever. I know how to eat healthy and I like eating healthy, I get more repulsed by super cheesy, greasy, creamy dishes and prefer simple things. I worked with a lady who does food therapy for children with ASD mostly and she said I might have sensory issues since a lot of my pickiness is based on texture as well. Which makes a lot of sense cause I can see a lot of overlap with my brand of anxiety and having sensory issues. \n\nAnyway, all this to say what do you think? No eating disorder truly fit my description when I researched but idk what to do. Thank you", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

A different but slightly related thing is that I have sensory issues with most foods so the only foods I typically eat are things I shouldn\u2019t eat tons of on a regular basis. I\u2019m also usually very broke. All these things combined just make me end up not eating to save food, simply because I don\u2019t feel like it, I\u2019m busy, it wouldn\u2019t be healthy for me to eat such a thing twice/three times a day, or a variety of other things. I don\u2019t see myself as fat, I don\u2019t have the typical body issues that they say people with EDs have. I looked at the FAQ and one of the threads I looked at mostly had comments saying if you don\u2019t have that kind of thinking it\u2019s not an ED.\n\n  \nIs my disordered eating just that or an ED?

I ate mostly (greek) yogurt, peanut butter, some cereal and granola (with almond milk), and a bunch of potato chips with sour cream dip, so not really healthy.

This is kind of a long story so bear with me; I just feel like I needed to give context because some of it is crucial imo.\n\nThe pre-amble goes as follows: over the summer, I spent quite a bit of time in the local psych unit and in rehab. I left rehab October 1st and since, I've returned to my community (8 hours away from the treatment centre/city, fairly remote). Originally, I was supposed to do IP ED treatment instead of rehab but due to the severity of my addiction, the ED people said they couldn't take me until I completed a substance abuse rehabilitation program and was able to remain abstinent from drugs/alcohol for a period of 4 months. So as per their recommendation, Iv'e completed rehab but trying to remain clean/sober while in active ED is so fucking hard... I blew my 90 days of sobriety the night I got out of rehab; I drank and used with a friend I made in treatment with whom I had to stay until I caught my flight home the day after my grad. Long story short, since I haven't even been able to stay sober for more than a week at a time.\n\nSo amidst all this, my ED has become overwhelming/all-consuming and I'm getting to a point where medically, I will need some form of treatment for my anorexia. In the summer, I was restricting heavily and drinking heavily, and actually my weight was so low upon my intake apt that rehab couldn't take me for several weeks until I refed myself in the psych unit. My ED was monitored/addressed in rehab but it was definitely not full blown ED treatment. Since being home, my weight's dropped again, my eating has slipped and I've already had to go to the hospital once by ambulance due to dizziness/faintness. I just know something needs to give and it's on me to make some commitments to recovery or else the alternative is pretty grim. As for treatment options, I have the option of doing a residential ED program or the option of doing an assessment with an ED team in a nearby town that will link me to resources in my own community and help me build my own OP treatment program.\n\nThere are a few factors making me hesitate on the IP treatment though: one, it's 10 hours away from my home community and two, i'm supposed to be returning to uni in January and three, I'll likely lose my apartment if I go away.  On top of this, I may also run into the roadblock that they won't take me due to my lack of sober time. My biggest concern, and my family physician agreed, that the isolation I got from going to rehab so far from home; I feel so far from that reality that I have a hard time believing it was mine for a time. It's as if the whole experience happened to someone else and I fear this happening if I go away to IP ED treatment. Another con to going IP is the fact that I won't be able to return to uni this semester and the student loan program will start making me pay them back and if I'm IP, I won't be able to work, and right now I almost don't have enough money to pay rent and tuition for this coming month/term. In my opinion, the financial stress that'll come with this will almost be devastating enough to outweigh the benefits of this decision.\n\nPersonally, I like the build-your-own OP treatmen option but part of me fear there'll not be enough structure on the refeeding front. I know I need to gain (which scares the living shit out of me) and the prospect of doing that outside an artificial/medical environment. Nonetheless, I do know I'll have to take on a lot of responsibility for my recovery if I go along with this plan; that alone terrifies me but I know I have the resiliency to do it. I just don't know how much longer my body can take sitting on the fence like this. I'm trying to follow the meal plan I was given before going to rehab because it accommodates my fear foods and dietary choices, but I'm having a hard time with meeting its requirements. This is where I think IP would helpful; the refeeding/weight gain process is always brings out the worst in me and I find it hard imagining myself doing it outside a hospital setting. I already have a lot of groups, meetings and therapy going on but again, the refeeding aspect of recovery is currently regressing as opposed to moving forward.\n\nAll in all, I guess I'm looking for opinions on these two treatment options. I just feel so divided and the responsibility to recover is weighing on me. I just know I need to do something, and I need to start soon. Sober time should be my first priority, but I also need to make sure I'm making some progress with my eating.  Any feedback is appreciated!", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

{"post_id": "e8wv97", "created_utc": 1576012558, "title": "Navigating ED recovery when broke and uninsured", "author": "mylessandovaldpt", "self_text": "Unfortunately, the barriers to eating disorder recovery for so many people are financial in nature. It can feel discouraging to ask for help and receive the same blanket response: \u201c*You need therapy*.\u201d\n\nIn an ideal world, high-quality, professional help should be available to anyone who needs it, regardless of ability to pay. To be honest, if you are struggling with symptoms, you probably *would* benefit from a higher level of treatment. But in this world, it is not always feasible to pursue professional help when you are\u2014put frankly\u2014broke and uninsured.\n\nSo if you are in that boat, what can you do?\n\n1. **Apply for treatment scholarships or grants.** There are several foundations that regularly offer scholarships to those facing financial barriers to treatment. The [**Eating Recovery Center**](https://www.eatingrecoverycenter.com/patients/insurance/insurance-and-paying-for-treatment/scholarships-and-free-treatment-options) has amassed a broad (relatively speaking) collection of these scholarships and grants. Consider applying to one or more of these scholarships or grants, even as you work to leverage your own recovery at home. If you hear back in two weeks, two months, or two years and you no longer need that level of support, they will simply give your slot to the next applicant.\n2. **Maximize your free support system.** There are a number of free, mutual-help programs that can offer accountability, education, and connection to a positive, recovery-focused community. Look for groups that give you a sense of belonging and foster problem-solving, not pity-partying. [**SMART Recovery**](http://smartrecovery.org/) offers online, peer-facilitated meetings based on behavioral principles that can be accessed from the comfort of your own home. If the thought of staying in recovery forever feels hopelessly daunting, focus on abstaining from addictive behaviors from one meeting to the next, where you can tap into the community\u2019s support to rekindle your commitment to recovery.\n3. **Find food that feeds you, not your eating disorder.** There are a variety of methods, programs, and food recommendations for eating disorder recovery. None of them work if you don\u2019t eat their food or if you continue to use purging behaviors afterwards. Having external accountability can help you follow through on any food plan of your choosing. This can be as simple as texting an accountability buddy before and after meals. It might be investing in a month of pre-made meals to consider what healthy eating may look like in your recovery future. Ultimately, you get to decide how to use food in a way that heals instead of harms.\n\nLastly, there are a few circumstances in which medical attention is necessary, regardless of ability to pay. Please seek immediate medical attention if you demonstrate any of the following symptoms\\[1\\]:\n\n1. Heart rate &lt;40bpm or irregular\n2. Temperature &lt;97F\n3. edema (swollen fingers and/or toes)\n4. seizures or tingling sensations which can signal significant electrolyte disturbances\n5. suicidality\n\nRemember, being dead broke still beats the normal kind of dead.\n\nReference:\n\n1.

I'm going to therapy, but I've only started 3 weeks ago (going there once/week) and let's just say eating is the last and sadly smallest issue that I have right now - so the focus was on just pretty much giving a new therapist all the information they needed about me and my past, with my disordered eating being a very small part.\n\nSo I barely know anything about eating disorders nor do I have a specific diagnosis yet (some type of anorexia, though). \n\nWell, here's the thing: I'm a vegan. I became a vegan when all of the bullshit started because I figured: I'm barely eating anyways, it's not that hard to make that vegan (for the animals' sake I've wanted to go vegan for years but never had the self discipline) plus it's a great excuse to not have to eat something I'm offered or generally eat in public. \n\nBut over the last 2 weeks I've let myself eat a little bit more, I was tired of being cold and dizzy all the time, I realized how bad it could get if I kept loosing weight and tbh I was tired of my bullshit and of not being able to enjoy my teenage life.\n\nThen the \"binging\" came. All of the sudden I was uncontrollably eating, even if my stomach was already cramping and I just wanted to stop but couldn't. During that I also ate meat, animal products etc. I felt so guilty. For both the animals but also the fear of gaining weight, of loosing control. I say \"binging\" because I was consuming a normal amount of calories. But for me it was double/triple the amount I was used to by now.\nNow I wake up bloated everyday and I feel so incredibly shitty and just want to go back to starving myself. I'm now in a cycle of restricting until around 6pm when I get incredibly hungry and eat a shitton again.\n\nBut back to the actual dilemma: I know how bad it is to eat animal products (I'm really not preaching here but personally I just can't bare the thought of harming an animal). But being vegan has made my eating disorder so much worse. Because I just HAVE to look at labels, ingredients and inevitably calories. I constantly get weight loss posts suggested on instagram and youtoube because I guess the algorithm has picked up on me eating vegan and now I'm just stuck in this cycle and I don't know what to do.\n\nIf you've read this, I'm so thankful, I'm sorry that this is so long.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

Over the last year, I've been struggling with this desire to just starve myself until there is nothing left, and after my husband texted our friend (who I suspect also struggles with anorexia) that he loved her while he was blackout drunk, I've just snapped (there is a long story behind this involving mistakes on both sides and a near threesome with the friend, but I'll just take this moment to say I've forgiven my husband and our relationship is mending from this incident). \n\nAnyways, I'm not looking for advice or anything. I just needed to get this off my chest because I have no one to talk to about this, but I know I'm in trouble.  My brain is constantly focused on my calories and exercise, and I just want to let it take me. Obsessing over food and diet is some much easier than constantly focusing on what a useless piece of shit I am, so fuck it.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I know for sure I consumed 2000 kcals today. If anything I might be in a slight surplus (300kcal surplus max) . I'm just glad I didn't binge to the point I feel like I have no self control and feel like shit that I would need to purge. Here's to another recover day!\n\nThanks for reading guys", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I really really really hate when people act like not eating is a personality trait. A lot of my friends at school will constantly say, \"omg guess what, I haven't eaten all day because I was so busy with class/studying etc and I forgot to eat\" when I'm going for dinner with them or something.  The problem with these comments they always make is that it almost sounds like a boast, and it triggers me to feel guilty for having eaten normal meals that day. It triggers the part of my brain that is telling me to starve myself (which always backfires and leads to binging). Eating normal meals for a day is a victory for me, and hearing these comments completely undermines this. I also see a lot of comments like this on social media, especially on tik tok. I can imagine this is triggering for anyone struggling with any kind of eating disorder, and it upsets me. \n\n  \nThe second thing I want to talk about is the lack of awareness for eating disorders other than anorexia and bulimia. It is sickening to see that anorexia and bulimia are glorified by the media. Not only that, but they seem to be the only validated eating disorders. I am constantly made to feel like my struggles are invalid because I am at a healthy BMI, and I do not starve myself. This has been damaging and is part of the reason that I didn't even realize I had an eating disorder until I was two years deep into it. This also creates a lot of shame for people who are struggling with eating disorders other than anorexia and bulimia. For months, I have searched for youtube videos of people overcoming similar eating struggles that I have fought but can only come up with a handful. However, there are tons and tons of videos about anorexia recovery. And back to the media thing especially on tik tok....all the people who are glorifying not eating and anorexia are making me so angry. They'll comment things like \"and that's on ana\" and treat it like it's a joke and this is just so upsetting for anyone with any kind of eating disorder to see.\n\n  \nAnyways, for those going through BED, EDNOS, or disordered eating in general who is looking for validation for their struggles and confirmation that they are not alone, watch this interview with figure skater Gracie Gold: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO1PdhaT4jI&amp;t=130s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO1PdhaT4jI&amp;t=130s)  \nWhen I first watched this last year, I finally realized that I am not alone...her story describes mine almost perfectly, down to the pressures of figure skating on body image, and the offhanded comments that can end up sparking an ED. Her courage is also very admirable and inspiring. It is rare to see such a high profile individual being so candid about their struggles, and it is rare for these struggles to include an eating disorder that is not simply anorexia or bulimia.  \nAnyways, no matter what you are struggling with, your struggles are valid. You are not alone. You deserve to recover and love yourself inside and out.   \nLots of love and happy holidays :)", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I don't have the proper vocabulary to describe what I'm watching so I'd appreciate your insights.\n\nNikocado Avocado = Crowdfunded Food Addiction (long post)\n\nI've been watching nikocado avocado and had a few thoughts. Here\u2019s a mukbanger whose obsession with food most people would consider unhealthy generates millions of views.  I think I've been so fascinated with his videos because underneath the views, glamorous thumbnails, and studio lighting, he has a food addiction that has clearly impacted his health. Simply compare his current diet and weight to his vegan days. Can you get a more polar opposite change in lifestyle? His physique, a landscape of chins and stress marks, serves as a clear and genuine example of the effect of unhealthy eating.\n\nNick\u2019s channel features videos in which he consumes a large amount of mostly fast food. Fast food factors heavily into his food addiction. This is an immensely successful industry built entirely on food scientifically proven to taste good, with fats and sugars lighting up pleasure chemicals in brains across the country. \n\nOver the past few years Nick has achieved significant fame and wealth from his mukbang videos, enough to make it his sole source of income. In a fashion reminiscent of freak shows, this young man is getting paid to consume large amounts of food. In fact, every mukbang video he posts and its consequent monetization directly generates the dopamine of money and attention from viewers. His income derives from the \u201c100\u2019s of advertisements\u201d that viewers find \u201creally weird\u201d and \u201chella annoying\u201d. Is this not crowdfunded obesity?\n\nNick\u2019s story of food addiction is sadly one of many in the obesity epidemic that is clogging the heart of the country. Yet what fascinates me is that his journey has been uniquely preserved in the amber of video, fueled by bites and bytes, and made possible by viewers like us.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I've been stuck in a really bad cycle of severe restriction and binging. My restriction is outweighing my binges so I'm not gaining, but I'm losing verrrry slowly now. The binging makes me feel awful physically and the purging is terrible for my health.\n\nI also am an addict/alcoholic (in recovery, not active), and I think there's some very real validity to the concept of being addicted to hyperpalatable foods like chips, donuts, cookies, etc. I never used to even like those things, but when I restrict, I get crazy carb cravings for the saltiest and sweetest foods.\n\nSo I got rid of any binge foods in my house (PB, jelly, bread, tortillas, velveeta cheese, popcorn, pancake mix, pasta), as well as the components that can be used to make those foods (cocoa powder, flour, sugar, butter, egg whites, milk, etc).\n\nI'm trying to eat just whole foods. The only foods I am keeping in the house are:\n\nvegetables-green beans, tomatoes, mushrooms, zucchini, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, cabbage, red cabbage, pumpkin puree, spinach\n\nmeat-venison, chicken\n\nlegumes-lentils, black beans\n\nfruit-strawberries, apples\n\ncheese-imitation cheese slices, grated parmesan\n\nother-eggs, PBFit, hot cocoa mix, coffee, stevia, sugar free jello, sugar free chocolate syrup\n\nSo I've loosened my calorie limits, and I'm literally just limited to these foods. I'm letting myself eat to satiety (until I feel full). It sounds boring, but there is a TON of foods I can create with these items, and they're all healthy. I use lots of spices (oregano, cayenne, pepper, thyme, parsley, cumin, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, ginger).\n\nWhen I get a sweet craving, I mix up PBFit and dip apples in it, or I bake softened cinnamon apples in pumpkin puree for a \"pie\", or I dip the strawberries in the SF chocolate syrup.\n\nWhat I find is that without the hyperpalatable foods, I'm not overeating. I'm still at a deficit, actually. That awful BINGE/ CONSUME/ EAT SO FAST YOU CAN'T EVEN TASTE IT feeling is gone. After awhile, even if I feel like binging, I get tired of the food (usually when I'm full) and will eventually walk away from the kitchen.\n\nI'm still early in doing this. But I'm hopeful. I was so tired of only eating mushrooms boiled in bouillon for days on end to keep to 100 cals/day and then eventually going on a 5000 calorie binge and feeling the need to restrict \"just until I make up for the binge, then I'll go back to 800 cals a day\" (HA). Weight loss will be slower this way, but I see this as a form of harm reduction, because the binges were physically painful for my stomach, and the purging is AWFUL for electrolytes, etc. I really wanted to be underweight by Christmas, and now it might not happen until January. But that's ok, I guess. Kinda feels a bit like harm reduction and a bit like a step toward recovery.\n\nHas anyone else tried just limiting to 95% whole foods in their diet? What effect did cutting out hyperpalatable foods have on your cravings? I know there's research that shows acclimating to these healthy foods changes your gut microbiome, which in turn influences cravings, reducing the desire for sugary and salty and fatty foods.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I barely ate anything for a week 2 weeks ago because I was really sad over something and lost 5 lbs, but as much as I wanted to continue(and still want to...) I am controlling myself enough not to do that. But I hate myself because instead, recently, in order to cope, I have binging way too much, and gained the weight back. For the past few school days I have been avoiding breakfast(and lunch) and sometimes don't eat until 6 pm, but then i can't stop shoving my face with food in one sitting, it's like my stomach is this endless abyss, and the point is, I seem to have relapsed into my old unhealthy thoughts and eating habits.\n\nBut, I've never purged. I never wanted to or want to, as I hate throwing up, but I get insanely nauseous extremely often. Anyways, cut to the upsetting incident. I don't know if I'm overreacting, but I haven't been able to talk to anyone about it and it ruined the rest of my school day and is still now on my mind(I think I'll talk to the guidance counselor about it tomorrow), so I need to get it off my chest somehow.\n\nTLDR: Actual story, TW\n\nToday, during class, I went to the bathroom, and there was noone there, and I went into a stall. Like half a minute later a girl walks in(i don't see who ofc cuz i'm in a stall) and for the next few minutes(but it felt like an eternity) i hear this sound that I can't describe or put my finger on, it's something i've never heard before, I was trying to figure out what it was, and couldn't. The only thing it reminded me of/I could describe it as similar to was the sound of when you sud up your hands with soap and are scrubbing them together, kinda like the sounds your palms make, but the sink water wasn't on. It was this constant repetitive sound, and I kinda was still for a few moments/minutes, just trying to figure out what i was hearing, and being too curious to leave, I was a bit on edge, like this small horror was creeping up on me. There's the occasional cough or noise from this girl. Then, she suddenly coughs so loud that I genuinely got scared and nearly jumped out of my own skin, i definitively flinched caused it was so loud, it's like it bounced off the walls and filled up the whole bathroom. It wasn't a cough, it was too loud, it was a retch, if someone coughed that loud I'd assume they'd be too sick for school, it was so emotional, it was so intense, it reminded me of the sound i'd make when i wanted to retch. And then I realize, she's purging. Or, at least, I think she was. I didn't want to make any sound to alert of my presence, but I had to wash my hands and get out of there. The noises she made were so distressing, I don't want to say disgusting, I wasn't disgusted just disturbed and sad and scared and shaken. I wanted to ask if she was okay or somehow help her but didn't want to make her embarrassed or anything, I didn't want to be wrong, so I went back to class. The period was almost over, but I was shaky and teary eyed and almost started crying, and i felt like I wouldn't be able to focus for the rest of the day, I felt really weird walking through the halls, talking to people.\n\nSorry if this didn't belong here, but I really couldn't keep this to myself, and I don't know who to tell, and I feel guilty for not asking if she was okay, and i got so scared, and I couldn't quite process what happened, or if what I assumed happened was actually happening. It felt like a dream, it feels like it didn't happen. When I get really emotionally distressed I start to really dry heave/retch(my body does it on its own), but I've never been able to actually throw up(I don't want to, but in those moments I wanted some sort of release, cause I felt like I couldn't cry, but i was too afraid to actually vomit/help myself to vomit) but I think, that could've been me. That could be me. (The thought that it could be/become me is scary).  \n\n\nEdit: Changed last part for clarification, I don't wish to be in her position, the thought of me being in her position is what's scaring me into getting help. I don't want to gain an eating disorder.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

When I fast I struggle with binging after so instead I tried to just eat completely clean. Over the last few months I have cut most things out of my diet and I get very obsessive about getting the right number of fruits/veggies/proteins/nutrients. I don\u2019t eat anything processed and I only drink water, tea &amp; coffee (which I am slowly trying to cut out). I thought eating as healthy as I possibly could would work out better than fasting because I can still lose weight but not so fast that my body starts to freak out, leading me to binge. I don\u2019t count calories either because for some reason that also causes me to binge (constantly thinking about numbers just makes me think about food and how much/little I have left for the day) but I write down what I eat and what time and just from looking at the things I eat and knowing what I know about calories I am positive that the amount of calories I get each day is considered restrictive for my height (I\u2019m 5\u201911).\n\nOver the last few weeks I have been experiencing extreme paranoia, I get nervous walking outside because I think I\u2019m being followed or someone will hurt me, it takes me HOURS to fall asleep because I constantly check the locks and every sound I hear spooks me (I live alone) and I have been having thoughts that my coworkers hate me and I\u2019m going to get fired.

And whenever the little bulimic dolls vomit their hair conveniently never falls into the toilet bowl and gets soaked with vomit and toilet water.\n\nAlso, how do they purge without tearing up? How do they just walk out the bathroom stall, hands perfectly clean, and the only indication that they were vomiting is the obnoxiously loud coughing and just wiping their mouth as they come out? How do their clothes stay vomit free? How do they never have those moments where your mouth turns into a hose and watery vomit gushes out and sprays the outside of the bowl? Who the fuck coughs everytime they vomit? I mean yes, it happens sometimes, but *cough cough cough cough*, Oh I'm done purging! Really?\n\nAnd I hate how clean they are every time they purge. How do they not have vomit dripping down their chin and all around their mouth and droplets of it in the hair because of crazy backsplash? How do they not wash their mouth out with water? What do they do, just wipe their mouth lightly and swallow whatever's left in there?

{"post_id": "e9iip0", "created_utc": 1576123700, "title": "How did this happen?", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "I had never had any issues with my eating habits before this summer. I used to be a chubby kid in middle school, sure, but it was never something I obsessed over. Naturally, however, I\u2019ve become much more consumed by my physical appearance in recent years. How my hair looks, how my clothes fit. Ultimately it boils down to me being very insecure, and (as much as I\u2019ll deny it) caring an awful lot about what other people think of me. This summer, I really started to lose control. For the first time... almost ever, I became very insecure about that number on the scale. I was about 135 pounds back in July (I am about 5\u20191 or 5\u20192, I haven\u2019t been measured in a while). I started wearing very oversized, plain clothing in an attempt to draw as little attention to myself as possible. I was disgusted with my body, I didn\u2019t want anyone to see me. I wanted to be invisible. During this time, I had a boyfriend, and I would talk to him about how I wished I was skinnier and wanted to lose weight. He would discourage me, and tell me that it\u2019d be \u201cdisgusting\u201d if I weighed any less. But, eventually, tumblr got the best of me and I started to restrict. I would either fast, or I would obsess over what I was eating and never go over 500 calories in a day. I was working at the time, so this was a little easier seeing as though I wouldn\u2019t have much time in the day to eat or even think about food. I got down to around 125lbs by the end of summer. I quit my job before school started, and I started stressing way less about food. I would eat normal meals, and I wouldn\u2019t feel guilty. It could have been the nerves, or just me having other things to worry about. Who really knows? But this wouldn\u2019t last long. My (ex) boyfriend and I have recently broken up, and I\u2019m right back where I started. Sometimes, I\u2019m just too sad or just don\u2019t feel like I deserve to eat. I\u2019ve once again become obsessed with the portions and the calories, and I often purge. I want to bring myself to the edge.... I need to feel sick to feel good, but I don\u2019t want to die. I feel like this is just what I deserve. It\u2019s the only thing I have left. I should have enough self control to not be such a fucking pig. I want people to see that I can change. That I can be beautiful. I just don\u2019t want to feel so useless... so lost all the time. For the first time in a long time I\u2019m actually motivated and driven to accomplish something. I am currently 118lbs, and id like to get somewhere around 90, maybe a little closer to 80. I\u2019m sorry if you\u2019ve read this and found yourself asking what the point of me writing this was... I\u2019ve just never told anyone about this. This has become such a big part of my life so quickly, it\u2019s almost all I can think about. It\u2019s my obsession. I want to do this... I really do. I want to be beautiful. I\u2019m sorry", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

She stated that eating 800 calories a day was okay if it was in the name of harm reduction (as in instead of around 500). She told me my weight flat out after I had purposely not looked and made it clear I didn\u2019t want to know what it was. She talked about her own weight loss journey and how tracking apps like noom have helped her, and how she has lost 14lbs. I also had an issue between this session and last where I ran out of my most important medication for a whole week because I had no refills. She implied very clearly that she thought I was taking more than I should have by saying \u201cI don\u2019t see how they would magically disappear\u201d. I have taken my normal dose everyday, I do not take more than is prescribed per day, and in fact it would be impossible for me to do so because I do not have control of my medication as I am still a minor. She also stated that a side effect of this medication is weight gain, and then when I asked her if we could lower it she said no. I don\u2019t understand why she told me that side effect in the first place if she wasn\u2019t going to do anything about it. (Plus as if I didn\u2019t already know the possible weight loss/gain side effects already....). And the worst comment of all, \u201cgastric bypass is always an option!\u201d. Thanks. That just confirmed how fat I really am. I guess I\u2019ll just fuck with my physical body to make a mental illness go away, because apparently a gastric bypass is a great idea for some one who already struggles with restriction. Yes, let me get a surgery that makes it hard to eat. Let me get a surgery that makes it so I get sick every time I eat slightly too much. Fuck I haven\u2019t even binged in over a year. I started out at 304lb got down to 230 and then while in treatment for my ED I gained to 265 and in the past couple of months I have gotten down to 256. And yet she wants to suggest gastric bypass, as if I can\u2019t lose the weight on my own and I can\u2019t control myself around food? I understand that obviously I was binging in order to get to 304lbs in the first place, and I don\u2019t anymore. I don\u2019t even know where I\u2019m going with this, I\u2019m just beyond hurt. I feel like I have been broken. I haven\u2019t felt this hurt in years. I am determined to lose as much weight before I see her in the spring. She said \u201cit\u2019s not like you\u2019ve lost 20lb since I last saw you, so I\u2019m not worried\u201d. Well bitch, challenge accepted. Fucking bet. \n\nI apologize if this has made no sense.

I've also found out recently that my big sister has an ED and we both think that our parents have issues with food too (compulsive weighing, deliberately restricting, viewing foods as good and bad, compulsive exercising, guilt after eating, compensating for eating). For this reason, neither of us want to tell them about our EDs because we think it will make theirs worse, especially as they don't seem to realise they have any problems. One thing this has made me realise though is that I have no idea what a healthy relationship with food looks like.

I would greatly appreciate if you would be able to circulate the below message for my online survey to your followers as a way of allowing my research to appropriately represent the public. \n\n\nDo you worry about what you eat? Or how much you exercise? Do you spend lots of time meal planning or thinking about portion sizes?\n\nResearchers at the University of New England, are looking for participants over the age of 18 \u2013 please click https://unesurveys.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cx1Mg3chFa5stKZ to participate \n\nThis study explores different patterns of eating and exercising behaviours of Australian adults.\nThe survey takes approx. 30 mins to complete (and you can save your responses and finish it later!). You will also have the option to enter an email address and be invited to complete a short 10-15 minute survey 3 weeks later.\nAll responses remain anonymous and confidential \nand your responses will not be tied to your email address\n\nThank you!\n\nThis research has been approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of New England (Approval No HE19-085, Valid to 13/05/2020)\n\n\n\nIf you have any queries, please contact Dr Suzie Cosh: scosh@une.edu.au, ph:02 6773 2073", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

Since July of 2017, I've lost between 105-110 pounds. I just calculated my \"original\" BMI and it was morbidly obese at 44.9 . I am now sitting at about 27.1 . Which means I have only about two points left, of the twenty I started with to reach \nThe standard \"healthy weight.\" However, this is based on the average, where I am fairly muscular. So I am probably healthy, at least by body fat percentage, already. \n\nPeople constantly tell me how good I look, and that I shouldn't lose anymore. But I feel fatter than ever. To top that off, my body has taken a lot of damage. I have constant low blood pressure. Usually about 90-85/60-50. I have to stand up like an old person, because if I got to fast, I WILL black out. I am anemic all the time. I can only get about 4 hours of sleep at night because of the stimulant abuse the allows me to function at my job, and I'm losing huge amounts of hair daily. And yet, I still always feel invalid. \n\nBasically, this post is a rant about how life altering this disease can be at ANY weight. It's dangerous, and all-consuming, but no one batted an eye for over a year while I starved my body away. \n\nFOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK, \" JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T FIT IN TO THE ED BOX, DOESN'T MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE ONE! YOU DON'T HAVE TO EARN ANYONE'S ATTENTION TO BE SICK!\" \n\nokay.... Sorry for yelling, friends. Try to take care of your selves.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I have a lot of trouble hearing people talk about gaining weight and wanting to loose weight, etc. I\u2019m doing a program where we work in elementary schools as tutors and I have a site partner (all our other team members are at different schools).

She related that she has as well and that she\u2019s gained xx pounds because of it. I know she\u2019s not meaning to be harmful but it\u2019s really triggering. I\u2019m really trying to get better and avoid intensive treatment at least until the school year ends. It\u2019s hard. I do not want to tell her I\u2019m recovering from anorexia. I can tell she is already worried about my eating and I don\u2019t want to give her more of a reason to be worried.

I know that she\u2019s my does it because she cares but I hate it. How do you deal with triggering talk?

For years, I've hated my looks 98% of the time. Having multiple days in a row of feeling good is unheard of.)\n\nOf course though, I can't enjoy it because suddenly my brain goes into overdrive. \"Well, maybe it's just your inability to view yourself accurately. You know that's an issue. You probably look terrible and you just think you look nice.\" \n\nAnd then all my confidence and attempt at eating normally (no restricting, no binging, just eating a decent amount of healthy food and some treats when I actually want them) goes out the window because clearly i need to just go back to restricting heavily and exercise a lot and hide from all mirrors.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

My face changes significantly when my weight changes. I\u2019ve noticed that for a while I\u2019ve felt like I don\u2019t even know who I am anymore because it feels like my face looks different in every set of photos I have because my weight is constantly changing. For example I feel as though I look like a totally different person in my prom photos in june than in photos from my birthday in july. I look in the mirror and I don\u2019t even know who I am anymore. I feel like I don\u2019t have an identity anymore. It\u2019s really upsetting because I look at past photos of myself and I don\u2019t even know who that is. I feel like a fraud. Like someone who met me last summer vs someone who met me this month would think I\u2019m a totally different person. What am I experiencing? Is it normal? I should also mention that I struggle with warped perceptions of my body as well, eg. thinking I gained 20 pounds in two weeks just because I\u2019ve been eating normally or binging and thinking I\u2019m fat again. I have never been overweight and my perception of my body is so inaccurate that I can\u2019t even trust myself anymore to see myself as I am. It\u2019s always been like this, since I was young.

I maintained what was my magical number of 100 for a while. \n\nShe is super short, which is terrifying, because think of how little she eats. My bmr at 100 lbs was slightly less than 1500 kcal, but i was also running cross country-- she's not in any sports, whereas I still ate a lot from calories burned (2000-2500 calories a day). I probably needed even more because i started maintaining at 105 and continued to drop down to 100. I didn't weigh myself often because i knew i was maintaing, but i probably dipped 99/98.   \n\nBut yeah, i noticed how tiny she is. I thought i remembered her being \"thick\" (im sorry), but i also took into consideration that she's very short/always been \"small\", so i wasnt sure, and she wears baggy clothing a lot so i couldn't tell if she was just petite + thick or underweight (and now i know she wears baggy clothing because she's underweight and cold all the time) but then i creeped her instagram and yeah she's lost a lot of weight.\n\nI don't know if I'm actually objectively a lil chubby or if I'm just considering myself chubby in comparison to my underweight self. My face is fuller and i can feel my cheeks/\"second\" chin, my upper arms have a bit of flab, i have an ass, and there's \"fat\" above my knees again.\n\nOn the plus side, i no longer feel incredibly hungry (well, i never felt \"hungry\", my brain was just obsessed with thinking about food. I no longer am, minus the whole \"i have an eating disorder and hate myself\" thing). It's a weird thing. I remember when i first started losing weight, i frequently expressed to others that i never felt hungry, i \"ate just because\", and it troubled me. It troubles me again now because I'm back to that, \"eating just because\".\n\nAnyway, this girl is incredibly skinny, and it makes me feel shit about myself. I am shallow. But it moritifies me when my dad feels me up when i hug him (he did this a lot when i was underweight to see how badly my spine/shoulderblades were, please no comments calling my dad a disgusting creep) or whenever my dad stares at my body when I'm getting ready to leave in the morning because i know he's actively *noticing*  the changes. Also, someone found my old journal and turned it into the counselor (i made a post about this) and now my teachers and counselor know about my \"issues with food\" (counselor's words, because you can't be anorexic when you're weight restored) after the fact I've gained weight and it makes me feel so much less okay with the fact. And one of my track coaches (he's an old man) came to talk to me about getting my iron checked and he said that im looking better and \"have some color\" to you. And my english teacher always asks what I've eaten for breakfast and how im feeling and if im ok (randomly) and it all makes me wanna die and now there's this 5' anorexic girl who used to be my ex-girlfriend's best friend so i can't helo but obsess about how she's underweight because i know her.\n\nAlso i live in a very rural place so my school is objectively very small and statistically you're less likely to see people with earing disorders. So for a while it was just me underweight and i didn't feel threatened at all but now i dont feel good enough as fucked up as it is.\n\nI know this whole post screams narcissistic, i hate it/me for it too.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

In my country, Christmas holidays involve A LOT OF FOOD - it's not just Christmas, it's basically food food food food food from Christmas Eve to early January. \n\nAnd so I did. I lost so much weight before Christmas, then regained it back over the holidays and somehow managed to come to terms with it.\n\nThis year I tried to do the same trick...only that it was so much harder because a) there are various stressors in my life that just make me more anxious and unstable in general and b) my \"starting weight\" was already lower than last year.\n\nThese past two weeks I have restricted SO MUCH. I overexercise. I keep myself obsessively busy to avoid eating. I wake up in the middle of the night dreaming of sandwiches. I feel cold all the time. I can't focus on anything. I am increasingly withdrawn and isolated. I abuse diet sodas and teas. Etc.etc.etc. \n\nThis morning I hit a new low weight and, as always, I kept telling myself \"yassss! Keep going! Christmas is coming! You will be able to eat all the food then! It's just ten days! Keep going! Keep going!!\".\n\nBut today something snapped, and I binged. I had such a wild binge. I crammed 4,000+ calories in my mouth in less than an hour. Then I went on to purge some of them, breaking my 50-days purge-free streak.\n\nSo now I am sitting here, feeling desperate because I have \"ruined\" all my \"progress\" and I won't lose weight and I will \"have\" to restrict during the holidays as well, instead of being able to eat whatever I want.\n\nSee, my problem is that my idea of eating whatever I want during the Christmas holidays is not just the usual stereotypical picture of this recovering anorexic \"finally enjoying a meal with her family\". No. I don't want to enjoy \"a meal\". I want to eat infinite meals. ENDLESS quantities of EVERYTHING. I know I do, because that's basically what I did last year.\n\nI can't imagine having to succumb to my stupid shitty ED restrictive thoughts during the Christmas holidays too. I want to feel free at least for those days. I want to eat all the food, joining in with my family, feeling warm (by all meanings) and just stop caring about my little anorexic bubble for a while. But now that I binged I feel I have \"ruined everything\" and I do not deserve it anymore and everything will be as horrible and restrictive as usual.\n\nI want to cry and feel hopeless. And yes, I do realize all of this is crazy - but I can't help it. I do have a therapist, only I cannot contact her at the moment as I live abroad (but I will go back home for the holidays - that's part of why I want to enjoy them so badly: they are a moment I treasure in general, not just for the food).\n\nWhat can I do? How can I move on from here? Is it too much to ask to just be able to eat REALLY unrestricted for that period of time?", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

For the last 2 weeks, I just couldn't stop eating when I wasn't even hungry. I keep thinking about food, even tho it's not always on the first place in my mind it still is there.

Even on a diet when I eat normally I still think about food, what will I eat next etc. I don't eat only when I'm at school and don't feel any urge (thus I kinda wonder If I overeat out of boredom).

I just finished a whole box of vanilla ice cream (600 g) after dinner. I ate quite a lot (still normal ) during the day and after dinner there was this sudden craving for ice cream. So I went out and get some. Then I just finished the whole thing within 30 mins. I kinda felt guilty and my body did not feel well after I finished 2/3 of them, but I was kind nibbling of the rest even I didn't have the craving anymore. Same situation happens quite often like once every week.  Last time it happens I finished a whole package of chocolate cookies (around 500) and a Yorkshire pie (around 600) right after  a proper meal. I know the amount is not that striking compared to a lot of big eaters on YouTube, but to me still feel like binging (btw, I'm only 5'3'' and 48 kg) and the word itself kinda freaks me out. \n\n I noticed that I have this weird habit of finishing the food. For example, I never have leftovers because I will finish everything even if I cooked way more than I need. If I didn't have a box of chocolate, I might not even think of it. Once I'm aware of its existence, I have the impulse to finish it. I realized I do not eat the amount I need but the amount that is available to me. If I have only a bowl of soup for dinner, I would feel the need for more food. But if there is more food put on the table, I will definitely finish everything. Does this counts for some kind of symptoms of binge eating.\n\nPlease leave your opinion. I think I  really need some help here.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

We had animals that would destroy my stuff, so I was called \"piss boy\" despite taking 3 showers a day, and called \"stephanie,\" because of my long hair at the time. This kind of broke me down, and it wasn't until I had troubles with my biological father, that caused me to gain weight, making my shirts tighter and shorter, which of course, kids picked on. I had a few friends who were nice, but I could tell were gonna split off after we got to high school, I was right by the way.\n\nSo freshman year rolls around, things are so stressful, I'm eating a ton to distract myself, and I gain so much weight. New marching band demands kept it down mostly, but I just felt like I was growing, and then it happened. The doctor told me I was 300 pounds, at 13 years old, who takes that news lightly? Not me of course. So the year goes on, and things are looking up with the new strict workouts for band camp and such, until I came out, due to the everlasting wait that was finally over.\n\nSome people were nice, but others weren't, and it stressed me out even more. So from March to June, I didn't eat. I lost so much weight that my body shut down at school during class, that the cracker I so hesitantly ate would make me feel better, until I spit it up. I was down to crumbs and water, something a newly 14 year old boy shouldn't have to go through. Until I caved, I broke the streak, and thought it was over, that I finally got out of the hole I was in... but it was never the end of it (2014).\n\nSo last year, I grew back to 320 pounds, no work outs were working, dieting wasn't doing anything, and so I tried again, but it was much unhealthier, and made my best friend break down after month 5. I lost 80 pounds in the matter of a few months, I looked so great, so amazing, but inside I was dying, I could feel myself shutting down. No sleep, no thoughts, just empty. He forced me to eat out of care, but it didn't help (2018). \n\nFlash to now, and the same thing has been happened, I gained some back, and am jealous of everyone I see. \"I want that body,\" \"Why do guys not like me?\" \"If I was thin like my friends, I could get a guy.\" And so now I've been through a time period of undereating, I cant bring myself to do anything, and my family seems worried. I'm sorry if it sounds hard, but this is my secret, and I feel like nothing at times.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I\u2019d been overeating a bit the past week or so since I was stress eating from trying to finish all my papers of the semester. Yesterday it was at its worst. I didn\u2019t think I would have time for lunch since I had back to back finals that would have taken up all my lunch time, so I decided to have a bigger breakfast (my normal breakfast of oatmeal with peanut butter, plus a little extra of each, maybe half a serving or so) and get some protein bars to snack on. I thought that keeping my energy level more consistent rather than eating both before my last final would be better, so I had one after my first final/before my second. Well, then I finished my second final incredibly early and decided to get lunch at Starbucks. I had a bagel with cream cheese, and then I decided to get a hot chocolate instead of something with a bit less calories like I usually get (hot chocolate was about 520 calories for a grande, I usually get an iced matcha latte with almond milk and that\u2019s about ~270). Then, despite telling myself no, I also got a cake pop, adding about another 170. So here I am, almost already at my full general limit of 1700-1800, and when I get home I decide to eat the other bar, knowing that I wasn\u2019t hungry and didn\u2019t need to eat it then. For dinner I had some leftover orange chicken and rice, which would have brought me just a little bit over my calorie budget had I not eaten the second bar. Then I decided to eat a large handful of junior mints. Then my dad brought me home sushi that I didn\u2019t know he was going to get me. And eating all this was me restraining myself from binging.

They always put me face to face with a monitor that reads my weight out loud for everyone to hear.

I am hoping that some of you might be able and willing to give me some help and tips. I've been in recovery from AN-R for about 2 years now and am still struggling with pretty loud Ed thoughts. For a while, I was able to ignore them and they started to go away, recently, however, Ed has been getting louder and more frequent making it difficult to just ignore the thoughts of wanting to restrict and over exercise. Somewhat fortunately, I was injured at work (I work in an acute psych facility, it gets kind of physical) so I haven't been able to run or over exercise, even yoga is off the table at the moment, which is making Ed scream.\n\nThe real reason I'm posting is that with the thoughts getting worse, my dietitian really wants me to get more support, i.e. an IOP. Unfortunately, with work and an inability to tell my parents I'm anorexic (I'm low contact with them for good reason, my mom body checked me before I body checked myself), going away to treatment isn't an option. I looked into an online IOP but my rather unhelpful insurance wouldn't cover it so it'd cost  $1500/wk, which is not feasible. I'm currently going to therapy biweekly and am unable to increase that do to financial reasons since my therapist stopped being covered when my insurance changed. My therapist is awesome, though, so I really don't want to get a different one.\n\nThat being said, I hate Ed and am tired of him ruining my life. I really do want to get better but I'm stuck. I keep telling everyone that I'm okay, that I've got control and can beat anorexia, but oftn I feel like that isn't true, I feel more tired and weak than strong lately. I was wondering if any of you maybe have any suggestions on things that might help a 22 year old, or things that have helped you, fight back against Ed's voice when more support and treatment is needed but not a financial possibility?", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I was so wrong. All the years I spent sitting in bed filled with fear and disgust at the sound of my mom\u2019s nightly ritual I told myself, \u201cI\u2019ll never fucking do anything like that. How can she fucking shamelessly do this every night knowing that I can hear her?\u201d. I was so fucking wrong. I told myself that no matter how much I hated my body I\u2019d never take dangerous measures to lose weight... I was so so wrong. Unlike my mother, it\u2019s not bullemia that I\u2019m suffering from, it\u2019s anorexia. Instead of hoarding food to save for a binge like she does, I hoard capacity for my body to gain weight that it probably never will (\u201cWell, I should be 120, but I\u2019m going to keep it at 110 just to save a little room in case I decide to eat a little more one day). As time goes on people have gone from congratulating me for my weight loss to making comments like, \u201cjesus christ, are you sharpening your elbows every night?\u201d or, \u201c... are you okay? It seems like you\u2019re getting sick.\u201d. The other night when I was planning to lose a little more weight for what I call \u201cweight gain insurance\u201d all of this finally hit me. I started thinking about my life and all of the ways my mother influenced it. We never had food around the house. You always had to buy your own food and tons of it. Don\u2019t forget to eat it quickly before the other bingers in the house get to it. I had to get used to food being a very aggressive and sensitive topic in the house. Every time I\u2019d go to the fridge, no matter where my mother was in the house, she\u2019d suddenly appear right behind me (the sound of the fridge opening would always trigger the same response from her, \u201cWhat are you eating? What are you eating?\u201d), and peer over my shoulder in disappointment as I got my meal and ate it (she still does this a lot). Recently, when I finally told her I fucking hate when she does that she just said, \u201cBut... you\u2019re finally getting so thin, I don\u2019t want you to mess this up.\u201d. That\u2019s another thing, she constantly comments on the status of my weight and others. Every single day she rants and raves about how thin and beautiful I am now, a stark contrast to when she used to call me on the phone when I was gaining weight and say, \u201cI can\u2019t have a fat kid, (my name), I just CANT!!!!\u201d. All of these things, along with \u201csticky bathroom\u201d (I\u2019m sure most of you know what I\u2019m talking about), are things that I\u2019ve had to grow up with all of my life and is now drastically affecting me in my early adulthood. I\u2019m losing weight very rapidly, if clothes don\u2019t fit over my hip bones I want to kill myself, I\u2019ve been working on training myself to feel rewarded by the sensation of my stomach growling and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be able to stop. My mom has told me straight up that she is never going to stop throwing up and there\u2019s nothing I can say that will stop her. She\u2019s grown completely numb to the look on my face when I go into the bathroom and can smell and see that it\u2019s been freshly vomited in and she still has the AUDACITY to lie to me and say she didn\u2019t. \n\nThe main thing I want to say? Please, if you have  children, try to control your eating disorder at least for their sake. Please don\u2019t project your body dysmorphia onto them. I\u2019m starting to resent my mother for what she\u2019s helped shape me to become and every time she\u2019s called me \u201cskinny girl\u201d I just want to scream and cry.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

When I was a teenager, I    started watching what I eat more and obsessing over my weight. I had    periods, where I'd eat a lot and others, where I'd starve myself  and    consume less than 500, 400, 300, 200 calories per day. I called it    dieting. Since I was a notorious comfort eater, who suffers from    depression, my weight always fluctuated. No matter how often I starved    myself and made my weight go down, I'd always come back heavier. When I    finally hit 99 kilos, I knew that I had to stop. I never wanted to   enter  the 3 digits. But I also knew that I didn't have the patience for   a  normal diet. It would take me years. So I started to starve myself    again. I also went to the gym. I wished for an eating disorder. I  wanted   to have anorexia. Just for a bit. Just so that I could stop the   comfort  eating long enough and motivate myself to lose the weight.  Then  I  discovered purging. On my worst days, I could give into the   cravings,  but it wouldn't affect my diet.People complimented me on my   weight loss.  I wanted them to shut up. I wanted them to see, that I was   suffering.I  wanted them to worry, to see what I was sacrificing to   lose the weight.  But no one did. So I started doing it more and more.   And before I knew  it, I finally had an eating disorder. Not the one I   \"wanted\", but it  worked. For a while anyways.\n\nAnd    now here I am. I am finally back to a healthy weight, but my lips are    chapped, my hair is thinner than I'd like, I get cold much easier  than I   used to, my teeth are yellowish, my mouth is incredibly  sensitive and   my body is covered in ugly stretch marks that I'll never  get rid of. My   confidence is at an all-time low and I honestly dunno  how I could ever   love myself again. I just wish I could turn back  time. Stop before the   effects became visible. But it's too late now. I  am so incredibly   ashamed about it all. I used to love swimming, but I  haven't dared to   show myself in a bathing suit, yet alone a bikini,  in years.\n\nI   recently got  interested in a guy. He seems to love me, but he doesn't   know what I  look like naked and I am so afraid that he'll be disgusted   by what I  have done to myself. I don't feel like I could even blame  him.  I don't  know what to do. Or how to even address this. I feel like I  need to  know how he feels about it, before my feelings get too strong,  in case  he isn't okay with it. But I am also mortified of addressing it.\n\nAlso   I don't even know how I look like anymore. My body image seems to  shift  constantly. Sometimes (often after I purged) I feel pretty, other  times  I can't even stand to look at myself. I don't know how I look  like to  other people at all. I'd love to see myself as the world sees  me. How  can I bring my self-image closer to reality?

She said I didn't have an eating disorder because I was at a healthy weight so there was nothing to be worried about.\n\nWhen I finally got the courage to ask my mom for help, many months into my struggle, she and the rest of my family didn't understand and continued to trigger my eating disorder by shaming me for eating, by pushing diets, by making off-handed comments about my body. My mother always points out anorexics. \"It's so sad,\" she says. And she never knew, never even considered that her daughter was going through a similar thing, just in a different way. \n\nWhy can't anyone just understand how freaking painful this is?

The calories I am consuming, the way my body looks, the number on the scale, and the changing weights of others.

It makes me want to scream. Because you know what?! I lost an obscenely unhealthy amount of weight and muscle in a couple of months last year, and you'll never believe it, but I was STILL suffering every day with the same eating disorder. I was just in a position where I could over-exercise to compensate for my weekend binges because it was summertime. And after that summer, I was praised for my weight loss. Like it was some big achievement. Like I was worthless when I weighed more. Mothers began to use me as an example to their young daughters. \"Look at her, she lost so much weight and now she performs better!\" I am so fucking broken inside.

Say what you want about this, but our connection has been entirely safe and healthy up till yesterday. We're not committed at all, I would more consider us friends with benefits than anything else, though the age disparity makes this complicated in some regards. \n\nAnyway, with that background done, uhhhh, here we fucking go. I was at college for the past semester, just getting home for winter break. I recently decided I wasn't returning to that school because it did a number on my mental health and was hard to afford, and I wanted to be closer to my family. He seemed happy that I was returning. Before I had left for school I was at my lowest weight, i'm male, for clarification on some other details, 5'10, and was 125 pounds, which put me somewhat underweight. He commented on how I should gain ten pounds so that I would have more energy, which didn't bother me at the time. Then I went to school and got severely depressed, stopped leaving my room, and started eating a lot more. I gained about 12ish pounds, putting me around 136 or 137 depending on the day. Honestly I didn't feel that bad about it. I know it's mostly muscle from walking a ton for my work, and figured I could work off the tiny bit of stomach pudge i'd gained. I wasn't panicking over it, yet.\n\nYesterday night I went over to his house. Things, progressed, ya know as they do and I was standing in his kitchen in my briefs making us something to eat. He took a few steps back and said \"Yeah your thighs are definitely a lot bigger\". My fucking heart just plummeted. My thighs make me so insecure. He said my arms looked bigger as well, but insisted it was \"In a good way, like you're stronger and bigger\". I don't want to be stronger and bigger!! but I did my best to ignore it, because I missed him and I wanted his attention regardless (don't @ me). He had chicken, bread with butter, and avocado for dinner. I choked down half an apple.\n\nLater on into the night we were cuddling and he was playing with my hair. I'm growing it out a bit, which is only marginally odd since i'm a dude, but it's not that long yet. It's in that awkward short/medium phase where it doesn't really know which way to go. He kept commenting on how I should cut it short, because that's how he likes it, to which I told him I was just tired of my old haircut and wanted to try something knew, and that he should stop commenting on it. To which he responded- and believe me when I say this is a DIRECT quote,\n\n\"The only thing worse than your new fat body is your ugly hair\"\n\nIt was a joke. He's always been a teasing jokey sort. I knew it was a joke. He would never say something that mean to me in any serious. But it hurt so, so bad. I couldn't help it. I just tried to get up and run out, I wanted to lock myself in his bathroom and fucking sob, but he thought I was being playful and pinned me back down, grappling me entirely as i'm not strong and he's quite muscular, and not letting me up, and I knew that if I said I was actually upset he would see me differently after that... So I just stopped trying. \n\nI haven't stopped thinking about it since. It's been almost a full day and it hasn't left my head. I'm just so sad... I want him to think i'm cute, and handsome. I want him to like playing with my hair now that it's longer and softer... I want him to praise me for being a healthy weight. But I didn't get any of that...\n\nAnyway, that's the story of why heavy restriction starts back up tomorrow. I'll see you all again when I reach 120.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I was very obese (I was overweight - obese since my teens, but that was the highest point) and l started to feel that my weight gives me too much trouble, so I've decided to drop some of it. First it was some form of portion control, 1 year in I discovered calorie counting. I have counted for ~1 year, and results (weight wise) were amazing, first time in~15 years I was in the healthy weight range. Wonderful, isn't it? Turns out, it isn't.\n\nI was binging too often, I was overexercising, I was blaming myself for being lazy if I won't have some kind of exercise once a day, for having some \"bad\" food. On top of that all I was working at shitty workplace with too many nosy people around.\n\nI've tried to dismiss all the red flags at first, but after some time I've became suicidal (mostly because of shitty workplace, but I think my eating disorders contributed to it too), like \"I know how much time is left for me\" suicidal. I went all in.\n\nI've changed my wokplace, changed my profession, and made an appointment to psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, but my psychiatrist tried to avoid all my talk about my clearly ED behaviours. Maybe, he was right to do it? Nowadays I don't think it will be a good idea to bring focus to ED. Even though I left a bit frustrated, first time in so long I was also hopeful.\n\nFast forward to now, I'm clearly in much better place - I'm not suicidal, I much more confident and calmer and refer to my antidepressants as \"+75% bullshit resistance pills\". Problem is - I gained weight. A lot. I'm not at my highest points, but it's already pretty uncomfortable - moving is a struggle, tying shoes hurts, etc. I haven't went to the gym even once in half a year. I want to change, I want to be physically comfortable in my body. \n\nSo I've bought a gym membership. I've said myself that I won't be focusing on losing weight, just on becoming stronger, so I've told my story to the coach, so she will be aware of why I'm so opposed to focusing on my weight. She was very understanding and nice about it. But then I needed to go through gym doctor checkup. And it wasn't pleasant at all, starting from her question about my goal (my answer that I want to be strong, nimble, toned and would be nice if I lost some weight in the process shortened to \"losing weight\" in her notes) to \"I understand that you don't want to focus on your weight, but you need to be aware of your problem, you need to lose weight\" (yes, this is one of the most colourful examples of everything before \"but\" is bs). Also, she tried to force me to buy her dieting consultation program, but I'm not really well off and she acted pretty toxic, so... No, tyvm. I left that checkup feeling really uneasy and nervous.\nI've went to the gym the next day (without personal coach) and it was ok, but I haven't been doing any \"challenging\" stuff so gym staff wasn't noticing me much.\nToday I went again (again, without coach - like I said, I'm not well off to afford all these nice things out of the blue), but decided to try deadlifts - I was dreaming that one day I'll be brave enough to try them. \n\nUh-oh. I've attracted attention of one of the coaches. I decided to not tell my story to one more person, so, in his defence, he had no idea about my struggles and he tried to be very delicate.

Got diagnosed anorexia purging type. Was always a self harmer, stopped for the most part and then boom, I shifted to something else I could control. I have grown up with parents who comment on my weight, and a mother who is proud of how little she eats (I would say man I\u2019ve only had eggs and toast today and she\u2019d say I haven\u2019t eaten anything yet today. She\u2019d comment on my clothes fitting tighter. Or my dad would walk by when I was eating something and say \u201cYou know where that\u2019s going, right?\u201d)\n\nI gained a little weight after I graduated from college, I was a normal on the slightly smaller side weight, but definitely a healthy one, and once I gained a little bit of weight, the comments from my folks returned.\n\nI started playing in a band, and something that really impacted me was that photographers take photos of you and you have no say whether or not you want a picture of you on the internet. It really fucked with my head and caused a spiral and I started playing scale games (well, I hit this weight, what if I hit this one? Oh I hit it! Let\u2019s go further.) I feel myself get power off of being hungry. I set my calorie limits lower and lower, and I completely stopped eating around people. I wait until the very last moment I can to consume something and give in, and I absolutely cannot eat before a certain time, or out with friends or even my partner. If I eat now, well, then I can\u2019t eat later. If I skip this now, I can eat later. Oh, it\u2019s later? Well maybe I\u2019ll just wait longer.  My entire day is focused on calorie intake, I chew my food and spit it out and I will throw food outside or cover it in dish soap. That\u2019s been a thing for a while. I just keep challenging myself to get lower and lower because to me, I need to be lower. \n\nI lost a significant amount of weight in the last two years, to the point where friends and family have shown concern, but I just tell them it\u2019s stress. \n\nI started purging about 6 months ago and told myself it was temporary, I felt like it\u2019s not a real problem because it\u2019s only been 6 months, and I\u2019m being extremely dramatic.\n\nMy bandmate caught on on tour and I opened up to him after some whiskey, and sometimes regret it. He caught me purging recently and it was humiliating. He\u2019s been incredibly supportive, but I\u2019m constantly either feeling hopeless and scared of dying, but I have a stronger part of myself that just feels a drive to keep going because I\u2019m not in the hospital and I\u2019ve got it under control.  I can\u2019t make up my mind on recovery because I\u2019m facing  this giant wall, and I know it\u2019s going to take so much energy to climb, and I am scared to gain even an ounce, or not be able to go lower. I have a therapist who I see weekly, and she told me if I keep up she\u2019s not going to be able to treat me and said she would recommend me to inpatient. \n\nI miss food. I miss eating and enjoying it and not doing a count in my head or putting it in my journal to calculate later. I feel like there\u2019s an imaginary hand pinning me down. I told my partner recently and he was crushed. \n\nHere\u2019s what this rambling post is I guess asking for: How do you tell people what you need? I feel shaky, I hate myself and how I look all of the time, and I don\u2019t know what to tell my best friend or my partner what I need, because I don\u2019t know what I need. I don\u2019t know how to tell those around me that I do not want someone forcing me to keep the bathroom doors open, or force me to sit at the table, because that just makes me scared and I\u2019ll just figure something else out. How do you ask for what you need in recovery? What was the most helpful thing your partner/friend/etc do for you in recovery? I\u2019m being asked, and I am so lucky to have these two in my life, but I don\u2019t know what to ask for. \n\nThanks for listening.

Over the summer we we became best friends before we started dating and then once the school year started things changed. We both immediately got involved in school activities. She was the lead in the musical and we just didn\u2019t see each other as much because we go to different schools. \nWe were still strong but things were definitely different. We were still in love but she said she was upset things were different. We went through a weird week where we kinda broke up and tried to be friends but we still loved each other so that didn\u2019t work out. Eventually we broke up for real even though we both didn\u2019t want to. She said it was because of mental health reasons and because I wanted her to get better I kept my distance and didn\u2019t ask questions. Recently we started talking again and I learned that she has been struggling with an eating disorder.\nI\u2019m sure she\u2019s had this for a while but I was too stupid to notice. She talks about her body a lot and has a distorted view of how large she is. She is short but in great shape. I always thought she was perfect but she made several comments on how fat she is. \nShe mentioned to me that she has a goal weight and that she will stop starving herself once she gets there. She mentioned not eating for days and throwing up several times. I don\u2019t think she will stop once she reaches that weight and she has put herself on an impossible timeline. \nSo here\u2019s my problem, I don\u2019t know what to do. I still love her and now that we\u2019re starting to be friends again I\u2019m happy, but this makes me sick to even think about. The suffering she must go through hurts me so much and she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem. She admits everything about throwing up but thinks it\u2019s fine. She has a friend who has anorexia and I think they feed off each other. I want to be with her but I don\u2019t want to put myself through seeing her like that. Above all else I want her to be happy and hearing what she does hurts me so much. \nShe used to eat with me while we were dating but now a majority of her calories comes from vodka. I feel like I\u2019m restricted in helping her because I don\u2019t want us to fall back into love before she\u2019s healthy but at the same time I can\u2019t help her without being closer. She has a shitty family support system, her friends won\u2019t help her, and she won\u2019t see a therapist because then everyone will know. I don\u2019t know what to do. I could tell her mom but then I think she will just resent me. Right now I think my best bet is being close friends again and just being a support system so she doesn\u2019t have to drink every night but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s good for me.\nSorry for the long post but I really need help.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

In my country, Christmas holidays involve A LOT OF FOOD - it's not just Christmas, it's basically food food food food food from Christmas Eve to early January.\n\nAnd so I did. I lost so much weight before Christmas, then regained it back over the holidays and somehow managed to come to terms with it.\n\nThis year I tried to do the same trick...only that it was so much harder because a) there are various stressors in my life that just make me more anxious and unstable in general and b) my \"starting weight\" was already lower than last year.\n\nThese past two weeks I have restricted SO MUCH. I overexercise. I keep myself obsessively busy to avoid eating. I wake up in the middle of the night dreaming of sandwiches. I feel cold all the time. I can't focus on anything. I am increasingly withdrawn and isolated. I abuse diet sodas and teas. Etc.etc.etc.\n\nThis morning I hit a new low weight and, as always, I kept telling myself \"yassss! Keep going! Christmas is coming! You will be able to eat all the food then! It's just ten days! Keep going! Keep going!!\".\n\nBut today something snapped, and I binged. I had such a wild binge. I crammed thousands of calories in my mouth in less than an hour. Then I went on to purge some of them, breaking my 50-days purge-free streak.\n\nSo now I am sitting here, feeling desperate because I have \"ruined\" all my \"progress\" and I won't lose weight and I will \"have\" to restrict during the holidays as well, instead of being able to eat whatever I want.\n\nSee, my problem is that my idea of eating whatever I want during the Christmas holidays is not just the usual stereotypical picture of this recovering anorexic \"finally enjoying a meal with her family\". No. I don't want to enjoy \"a meal\". I want to eat infinite meals. ENDLESS quantities of EVERYTHING. I know I do, because that's basically what I did last year.\n\nI can't imagine having to succumb to my stupid shitty ED restrictive thoughts during the Christmas holidays too. I want to feel free at least for those days. I want to eat all the food, joining in with my family, feeling warm (by all meanings) and just stop caring about my little anorexic bubble for a while. But now that I binged I feel I have \"ruined everything\" and I do not deserve it anymore and everything will be as horrible and restrictive as usual.\n\nI want to cry and feel hopeless. And yes, I do realize all of this is crazy - but I can't help it. I do have a therapist, only I cannot contact her at the moment as I live abroad (but I will go back home for the holidays - that's part of why I want to enjoy them so badly: they are a moment I treasure in general, not just for the food).\n\nWhat can I do? How can I move on from here? Is it too much to ask to just be able to eat REALLY unrestricted for that period of time?", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

My anorexia consisted of me restricting carbs and fats, and I have introduced these back into my diet just recently. But my weight fluctuated significantly throughout the summer and still does today.  I even went through the horrid constipation and extreme bloating. However, I realized in order to stop this cycle I needed to quit viewing the exercise as a way to rid calories.  I attempted Protozac (only 10mg) but quickly got off of it as it didn\u2019t work in the long run, but it helped some in the beginning with the fullness and it helped with the not overexercising mindset. However, this slowly started to develop into BED, and I am miserable.

I read that the best way to help this is to have set meal times, but my body has been trained and developed the habit of consuming so much at one time and for some reason it struggles with this!

I picked up some earl grey tea and a face exfoliant and a face wash.  \n\nFor breakfast I had a cup of earl grey tea sweetened with 50 calories worth of sugar.  I turned on the humidifier I just got and dropped 2 drops of peppermint oil all while listening to classical piano, \"ethereal remixes\" of piano renditions of songs, or other compositions (my favourite artist? ibi.).  My room is now clean.  My curtains and windows are drawn open.  My room is bright, white, cool, and minty.  My sister brought me a banana smoothie, it was a surprise, but it was a small cup so I allowed it.\n\nNow I'm going to take a shower.  After that I'm going to do a few gentle stretches because I feel sore.  Then I'll be planning the rest of my day.  I'm going to finish my drawing.  Study for a chemistry quiz.  And work on my story I've just started writing.\n\nAs I am writing this I'm listening to \"mind the gap\" by ibi.\n\nI feel clean.  Because even though I binged yesterday too, I feel in control today.  I want it to be a good day.  I know that if I make it a perfect day today and tomorrow a good day I'll be mad at myself and feel like failure.  Today will be a perfectly good day maybe.  \n\nI'm writing this because as shitty my eating disorder is, and how it twists how I perceive others comments and views on me, it makes me feel put together too.  I feel perfect, and graceful, and beautiful and so in control.\n\nI'm gonna go take a shower now and put on a cozy and clean pair of clothes.\n\nI hope you all have a good day.  Not a perfect one.  Because no day can be perfect, and trying to achieve perfection will always leave you unsatisfied because you want more and more and more and more.\n\nI hope you all have a good and safe day.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

It's more or less exactly what it sounds like - Ya got some snacks?

There are regularly trades within the same country too, btw (cause sometimes different regions have different foods, eg, you can only get Cheerwine in the Carolinas, so if I want it in Florida I'd have to have someone send it so me), so you might not have to worry about not being able to afford international shipping, cause chances are there's someone somewhere in your country who either can't get that snack, or just wants snacks in general lmao.\n\nThe general rule is that you have to have the trade be equal value, but I've messaged the mods to see if you can just give them away without asking for anything (or asking for less) in return. I'll update this once I know.\n\nPS: This subreddit requires you to have a 3 month old account and 600 combined karma and if you message them to try to get around that they'll immediately ban you so like, don't do that lmao\n\nPPS: If you do donate to a homeless shelter, make sure the it isn't a shitty one, like, don't donate *ever* to Salvation Army, cause they're horribly anti-LGBT; for instance, they completely refuse to house trans people.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Give that person a hug, ask how their day went, smile at them.  They might try to push you away but don't give up even if they hate you for it in the moment.\n2. **Do your research.**  Seriously.  There are many things that you should not say or do.  There are also many types of eating disorders and the behaviors and mentality that go along with these eating disorders vary.  Doing your research can also prevent you from asking questions that will hurt the person with the eating disorder.\n3. **Don't guilt trip them.**  Calling that someone or their disorder fake, self-centered, or other things like that will just make them feel worse.  Chances are they already realize that what they are doing isn't normal and that it might be hurting others.  You can bring up this point but don't just tell them that they are terrible.  \n4. **Give them options.**  You may try threatening them to eat but a lot of the time this fails as the person will just deceive you as much as possible.  Instead you could try to do things such as going shopping with them or getting them professional support.  \n5. **Respect their wishes.**  When you hear that someone you love or even a stranger is going through something this terrible your first reaction may be to help them by telling others or professionals.  *If the disorder is serious and they may die, do not do this, but* you may want to talk to them first.  If you go find help for them without them even being a part of this, they may resist the help.  The people you find may also not be understanding and from experience, this will not help.  \n\nBy no means are these rules completely accurate and each person varies.  Just wanted to give you a bit from my perspective.

I feel like I'm going to die if I don't have that food.  The obsession is so strong that nothing can break it.  I can tell myself that I don't need that food, that it's bad for me, that the fridge is full of food and I don't need to go out and spend money on the food I can't stop thinking of, but the fixation just grows stronger.  It's awful.   Sometimes I develop a fixation for something that I have in the house, and there is no stopping me from running into the kitchen and eating a lot of it.  What I wish is that somehow I could just stop for a second, somewhere between the food entering my head and running into the kitchen to put it in my mouth, and think about what I really want to put in my body, but I can't.  It really feels like there is a fog in my brain and no rational thought can make its way through.  It's like when you are turned on sexually and all you can think about is getting your sexual needs fulfilled.  There is no stopping the intense longing.\n\nDo you have this problem?  If so, have you had any luck altering your behavior?  Have you learned how to cut through the brain fog of food obsession?  I could really use some help with this.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I\u2019m at a stable weight, I work out regularly, and I focus on strengthening my body. \n\nHowever, I feel like the past 4-5 months have been a bigger struggle for me than even in the beginning of my journey.

It started off at once every other week, now I\u2019m at multiple times in one week (usually no more than 3 days in a week).

Modeling for the past 3, though I think that might be over for me.  This past week I\u2019ve gained ** pounds from binging holiday cookies and Costco boxes of crackers in tandem with not moving.  I\u2019m in my suburban home right now with nothing to do.  I\u2019ve suffered from depression since my early adolescence and now feel like a totally \u201csalt\u201dless, interest-less, worthless &amp; primarily lazy 20 yo (female).  I used to love cooking before my fear of animal derived, and eventually virtually all, foods developed.  Though the phobia is only selectively effective.  \n\nFor the past 3 years, ever since my agent pulled me aside after my first fashion week season (of booking nothing) told me I was too big and specific metrics of my body I needed to work on.  I was in New York to escape my depression back home, to carve a new life, support myself and my mom as we needed.  I had to succeed, I ended up crumbling.  Now that I look back, I see my binges began when I went vegan in high school and would be so hungry after my mammoth portions of kale &amp; fruit.  I shovel down lays potato chips, Swedish fish, French fries and Oreos bc hey! They were vegan. \n However, it was never an overriding issue in my life as it\u2019s been since myself moving to New York 3 years ago.  I remember thriving off of a few hours of sleep 7am workouts a kombucha and handful of raspberries a day for the first 2 weeks.  \n\nTwo hyperdrive weeks then I crashed and started a binge that seemingly hasn\u2019t stopped.   AT LEAST 2-4 times a week I binge until it physically hurts.  I\u2019ve seen the tolls in my fluctuating weights, chronic headaches, fevers, infections, acne, TERRIBLE digestion, bloating, joint pain and lymph swelling.  I\u2019ve socially isolated myself from my gaggles of model friends bc I\u2019m so ashamed of my eating habits and letting my body balloon so rapidly.  My work has obviously suffered, my agency actually just released me. My weight gain now has me teetering on the overweight line and has greatly contributed to my depression.  Avoiding people is nothing new to me but I can\u2019t stand to even see my best friends and have anxieties being around my family too.\n\n I\u2019ve recently reverted from my plant based diet to eating everything (save beef &amp; pork) in efforts to recover and remediate myself.  Years ago I reached out to a doctor who said I was fine, months ago I consulted another who noted my healthy bmi and referred me to an out-of-network, and thus out-of-my-budget, nutritionist and therapists to ease my anxiety.   I want to be healthy physically and mentally but I don\u2019t know what to do.  My family doesn\u2019t believe in eating disorders and are wholly unsympathetic to my lack of self control.

I found it super easy to continue eating healthy for the next three months, and by July my body honestly looked amazing.\n\nHowever, I started to get cravings for snacks (carbs/sweets) around that time.

I was super stressed/anxious around that time and that\u2019s when I first had a huge binging episode (eating so much that I was painfully full). I purged... and felt horrible afterwards.

{"post_id": "ecdkds", "created_utc": 1576680503, "title": "Introduction &amp; Venting", "author": "GodofPaper", "self_text": "I have suffered from BED since I was a teenager. Probably longer... Ever since I can remember, I have always loved food. I thought about it constantly. I worshiped it. My mother tells me that even as an infant, I wanted to be fed constantly. So I wouldn't doubt that I have a genetic predisposition to be obsessed with food. It was in my last year of high school, though, that my bingeing got horrible. I was scared of graduating and growing up, so when I got to college I was around 300 pounds. I hovered around that until about two years ago, when I finally lost over a hundred pounds!\n\nUnfortunately, I've gained most of that weight back in a very short period of time. This summer, a simple five-week binge had me gain 40 pounds. I lost some of that, but then promptly gained it back and then some, right now. Every time I try to stop, I find an excuse to keep bingeing. I know how to eat healthy. I still exercise every day. But I am feeling myself gaining more and more weight by the second and I hate it. I hate this eating disorder. I hate my love of food.\n\nWhy did I gain back so much weight and revert to bingeing? I don't know. I turned 30 and I was scared to death of that because I'm still single - have been single since I was 17, in fact - and want to have a family and children. And even then, BED has given me PCOS, so who knows if I'm even fertile!  I mean hell, I'm still a virgin (no, I promise I'm not an incel, haha). And most people in our Western society would laugh at me for being a 30-year-old virgin. I hate going outside now. I don't want anyone to see me now that I've gained back so much weight. I was so happy when I had lost all that weight; my life was going really well except for the turning 30 part. And now I am miserable again. I am about to lose my job, as the company I work for is in financial ruin, and that has been causing a great deal of stress (EDIT: As of right now, I am no longer employed). I am lonely with very few people I can call close friends. I have no romantic prospects, and even less of a chance of one because of the weight I've gained. But even when I was at a better weight, I hated trying to find a date. I hated going on dating sites; they were a chore.\n\nThe thought of having to re-lose all this weight is just daunting to me. I'm older now and I have yo-yo'd so much that it is going to take effing forever to lose the weight now because I have probably ruined my metabolism. My own weight loss inspired a friend of mine to lose weight, and now she is at her goal and successful while I've regained my weight and am miserable. I hate hearing about her success because it reinforces what a failure I am. She has reassured me that she doesn't have an eating disorder, so that I am playing this on \"hard mode\" in comparison, which I suppose is true.\n\nI have vented to my mom about how I feel fat and awful and she says, \"Then you need to do something about it!\" She is absolutely right, of course, but every time I try, the nighttime comes and the bingeing starts again.\n\nI occasionally vent about my struggles on a private filter on social media, but I know they are tired of hearing the same old whining about how I feel fat and awful and how I hate this eating disorder, etc. I don't know how many of them have the same eating problem. There are plenty of people with weight problems, but I don't know how many have bingeing problems.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

In high school I was binge eating because I didn\u2019t have many friends so my safe place was at home and I started boredom eating all the time. Then when I went to college, I was still antisocial and found it easier to go to class and immediately go straight home and boredom eat all day and night which continued until I switched majors and went back home. \n\nThe last few years I have struggled with binge eating but have managed to drop my weight from 170lbs when I came back from college, all the way to 135lbs, which is what I am now (3 year span). I tried water fasting for a week about a year ago and lost a considerable amount of weight fast and got all the way to 129lbs at one point but I felt like as soon as I saw that I was under 130lbs, I could reward myself with a binge session. So I did...now I\u2019m back up to 140lbs and I fluctuate anywhere from 130lbs to 140lbs with binge sessions and water fasting. I tend to \u201creward\u201d myself with binge sessions and even though I know I shouldn\u2019t and know I\u2019ll end up binging for the rest of the week, I still selfishly give in and feel disgusting afterwards. \n\nI broke up with my boyfriend about two weeks ago and feel like I have been in a state of nonstop binge since. When we broke up I was on the verge of being 129lbs again and am not slowly creeping closer to 145lbs. It may not seem like much, but these numbers and these binge sessions consume my life. All I think about is food and what I want to binge on. It\u2019s horrible! At 25, I should know how to eat properly, right?? \n\nI am determined to make 2020 my bitch and overcome this god awful disorder that has consumed my life for the last 10 years. When I look back at important life events, I honestly think about the binge sessions I had around those times and I hate it! I want to make life memories with friends and family this year and remember how much fun I had, not the food I consumed or restricted myself from. I want to eat a proper meal with someone and not have to fight the urge to binge when I get home or when I\u2019m alone. \n\n2020 will be my year. This is a must for my sanity and for my health. And most importantly, for my MF\u2019ing self!!! Time to ring in the new year with a new mindset, new goals, and a new way to look at food!! Eat shit 2019, it\u2019s a new year with no more binges\u270c\ud83c\udffc\n\nP.S. If anyone has any books/shows/movies/articles/groups/or words of encouragement, I\u2019d love to hear it!!

Although she didn't go into a ton of detail about her disorder she seemed pretty open about it and she brought it up in the context of like telling me her life story. \n\nNow here is where I think I may have made a mistake. One night, not long after we became roomates, we got onto the topic of working out and began discussing physical appearance and by association we began discussing weight. I shared that I was insecure about my weight and physical appearance and was considering switching to all or mostly cardio at the gym. In an effort to be encouraging Gracie told me that she thought super skinny girls aren't as attractive and that I'm skinny enough as I am. I kinda realized at this point that maybe this wasn't the best conversation to have with her and so I changed the subject. \n\nThis marks my first question: Can someone who has struggled with an eating disorder discuss things involving weight with someone who has not struggled with an eating disorder??\n\nI think something in our conversation led Gracie to believe that I was walking down the path towards an eating disorder. I think the timing was bad as well because I had recently been put on a medication that made me lose my appetite so I wasn't eating as much. To put it simply, Gracie began to pay a large amount of attention to my health, my exercising, and most of all my eating habits. She began to comment on my portion sizes, the food I was eating, constantly telling me to get more food, eat desert, telling me it's not bad to eat bad. As a person who actually likes eating healthy this stressed me out and made me not want to eat around her. I appreciated her concern but it also made me feel guilty about the things I was eating. Throughout all of this she kept making comments about peoples weight and saying how super skinny isn't attractive. She would also often demean her own appearance and call herself fat or chubby. One day, we had to weigh some suitcases and we had to use a scale. She refused to get on the scale, which I completely understood and said nothing about, but when I stood on the scale she immediately started making comments about my weight. Although they were complementary they made me incredibly uncomfortable. In the end, she moved out due to extenuating circumstances but I always wondered if I had done something that led her to act the way she did. \n\nTl;DR: can someone with an eating disorder have a conversation about weight with someone who doesn't have an eating disorder? And is it normal for someone who had an eating disorder to try very had to prevent someone else from getting one, but in an obcessive way?", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I wondered why my weightloss is so slow, leading to me restricting harder than ever. Yet yesterday my bloodchecks came back. I was diagnosed with hashimotos last year but i was told that my state is not bad enough to start threatment. So yesterday i realized that my ft4 is lower than ever and i actually decided to sit down and look up what the seperate figures mean. As it turns out both of my endocrinologists (i have switched doctors because my first one was a complete asshole) were not fully honest to me. For those who dont know, when you measure your thyroid results you get three numbers: THS, FT4 and FT3 ...the whole time, since my ths is just fine, i was told that _see everything is fine your ths is normal_ so naturally i could not start treatment. But yesterday i found out that the goddamn Ths levels dont matter, what counts and makes a difference are the ft4 levels, which in my case, are lower than ever. So as it turns out i had hypothyroidism the whole time so no fucking surprise my weightloss was so slow. I am very mad because i went through hell this year because of my damn ass eating disorder. Honestly even at my lowest weight i felt not even remotely as bad as i did the past six months. And all that because non of my doctors decided to clear me up and explain what my damn results mean. I could have theoretically started threatment last year because as it turns out, my levels where low enough to do so. Yet both of my doctors decided that i should wait for my thyroid to be completely dead. I mean theoretically its not live threatening but in my case it is. You see your thyroid impacts your mood and metabolism so it worsens my depression + my eating disorder because weight loss is really damn slow. \nI am really angry that i was denied threatment, especially after finding out that i could have started it last year but no. My doctors wanted me to life with the anxiety of having a dying gland in my body waiting for it to completely stop functioning.\nWhack.\nI made an appointment today, in january i will go to my doctor and demand threatment because living with a dying gland in my body is really not nice.\nLmao thank you if you read through the whole thing, hope you have a good day and never let anyone tell you that your state is not _bad enough_", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

And I\u2019m not even skinny so part of me doesn\u2019t want to control it because there\u2019s a delusional part of me that hope maybe I\u2019ll get sick enough to loose weight (yes I know how stupid that is) My therapist doesn\u2019t deal much with ED so she was like I\u2019ll give you some recommendations. I can\u2019t handle going to another therapist.  I just got used to this one and I love her.  All in all.  I hate myself.  I hate my body.  I hate food.  Really sorry for the rant.

Things got steadily worse and ended up with her in the ER after her chugging laxatives and her roommates calling poison control. \n\nShe started PHP yesterday and things seemed to go well; she mentioned how nice the staff were, she ate most of her meals/snacks, etc. Then after she got back today, she was miserable. She is the youngest person at her facility by several years and feels pretty isolated. She also complained about feeling forced to eat and that she wasn't sure if she wanted to continue treatment. I checked her vent ed social media (she doesn't know I know her account name, just that she has it) and it was filled with posts about how she didn't want to try anymore, she wanted to give up  and just let the ed do its thing, she posted about buying laxatives (her preferred purging technique). This sent me into a bit of a tailspin because I know that all I can do is encourage and support her. I constantly forget how easy it is for her to backslide. It always feels like 1 step forward, 8 steps back. \n\nI realize that her disorder is about her but any advice for someone trying to support a loved one with anorexia would be greatly appreciated. Also, any words of encouragement that you guys think it would be good for her to hear I'll be sure to pass along\n\ntl;dr\n\nmy gf is struggling with recovery and I don't know what to do.

I\u2019ve sort of suspected one of my co-workers has an ED too. I\u2019ve known her as an acquaintance for a long time, but have only worked with her for 6 months. She\u2019s 29F.

This past Sunday, we\u2019re working together and I made a comment about how one of the muffins we had just sold was 580 calories. She turns to me and says \u201cI stopped counting calories because I developed bulimia. It was so stressful counting that I would just decide not to eat. One day I decided not to do that anymore. I threw out my scale and now I\u2019m happier than ever. Tumblr poisoned me.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know what to say, so I just didn\u2019t say anything.

{"post_id": "ecoyu4", "created_utc": 1576734512, "title": "One year on...an update for anyone interested :)", "author": "ConsciousAppearance", "self_text": "This time last year I was debating recovery. I'd had a few back &amp; forths about it in my own head for a while. I'd suffered for 20 years (never formally diagnosed, unspoken to anyone but fairly damn obvious), it was my normal. I decided to take the morbid view that I only live once &amp; I'm going to try my best to make it a happy life that I enjoy to the best of my ability.\n\nOne year later, I've stayed the course. I don't calorie count, MFP is long gone. I don't exercise unless it's a nice day &amp; I fancy a walk. I don't have any more judgements for any type of food. Food is food. I have swung over to intuitive eating, listening to what my body asks me for &amp; having whatever that may be in whatever quantity.\n\nLife is very different to a year ago. I'm not quite weight restored yet but I am nearly there. I weigh once a month, if that.\n\nIt hasn't all been sunshine &amp; rainbows. Especially the beginning. Trying to overcome 20 years of fear &amp; rules isn't easy. But it is doable. Basically, I got tired. I was sick of fighting with myself over a carrot. I was sick of the rigidity, frustration, guilt, lack of sleep, obsession, isolation. \n\nLife isn't perfect. Don't get me wrong, sure I still have days where I don't like my body particularly much but the world doesn't end just because I feel bloated for a day or two. People don't hate me because my jeans size changed or my face filled out. I'm not worthless &amp; it shouldn't be an embarrassing thing to have to buy a bra. I'm not going to excuse myself for taking up some more room, for having a presence, for having a life.\n\nPeople love to make comments. Some are nice, some are thinly veiled, smug rudeness. It is irrelevant to me. These people don't live in my body or in my mind &amp; so whatever they think or have to say is unimportant. They aren't living my story or taking my journey, I realise now that is all I should be focusing on. I've spent years trying to please everyone but myself, that ended on Christmas day 2018. I'm not saying I'm now a selfish person who pushes others down to get ahead, I'm saying that now if I want to say no, I say no. I don't make myself uncomfortable if I can avoid it.\n\nThis Christmas I am visiting my parents. I'm not afraid of other people preparing food I will \"have to\" eat. I'm not making a show of eating to throw anyone watching off track, I will just be eating what I like, genuinely.\n\nNow, for the bad - My relationship with my husband isn't wonderful. I still don't like sex. I still am not comfortable being nude. I still don't like being touched. These are things I still have to work on. These are things that upset him &amp; we each have our own way of dealing with it, neither of which is very nice at times. I can be defensive, I can be sarcastic, he can become silent with an angry face, stomping around, ignoring me &amp; our daughter.\n\n He never researched AN, he never helped or supported me apart from when it suited him &amp; he thought me might get something out of it (ie sex). He doesn't understand it, he makes no effort to try yet thinks he knows all about it because he learnt about it for 5 minutes at school 25 years ago. That has been one of the more frustrating elements of my recovery &amp; it has caused an awful amount of resentment, on both our parts I think. \n\nIt was very difficult for me to go it alone with no understanding from my own husband &amp; I believe it is the main cause of my low libido. I didn't feel safe, supported or unconditionally loved by the one person I expected to provide that for me. Maybe I had too high of an expectation or I was being selfish. Whatever the case may be, it is what it is &amp; the best I can do is try to work through it &amp; fix what I can.\n\nAt least I'm no longer weighing my lettuce :)\n\nI'm wishing all who celebrate it a very merry Christmas, I hope everyone has a happy new year &amp; sending you all my best wishes for 2020.  I would also like to invite *ANYONE* struggling or who just wants to vent or chat to message me &amp; I'll listen. Christmas can be a difficult time whoever you are, struggling or in recovery or not disordered at all. Just talking/writing to someone out there can sometimes help.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

In my first dose I had a drastic response of relief from my disabling anxiety, phobias and binging. I feel like I am experiencing the baseline normal day that anyone without mental illness is experiences every day, and I am going to get my life back. \n\n\n\n\nHi everyone. As backstory, I have BED and have gained 100+lbs in the last 2 years, mostly in the last year though, after getting off antidepressants. I have PTSD, panic disorder, and agoraphobia. I pretty much have existed in a state of constant panic and never been able to relax for as long as I can remember. Food has been one of my only sources of peace, and obviously that developed into a monster very quickly. \n\nDay 1-After about 3.5 hours of my first dose of Vyvanse, I feel a peace I have never felt in my life. I was worried I would be wired and jittery, but my constant twitching, constant darting eyes, constant compulsive thoughts and fidgeting are completely gone. \n\nI legitimately cried a few minutes ago because I have never been able to feel \u201cnormal\u201d like this is my life. My heart rate was constantly at least 90 because I was so scared and jittery, even on Xanax. It is now around 65-70, which is a normal heart rate. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m going to crawl out of my skin, I\u2019m not jittery at all, and I have zero interest in binging. Like I have not experienced that since my binging started, I only have interest in eating because I know I\u2019m hungry and need to eat at some point. I used to sit and plan my next meal literally every second of the day, now I can focus on doing literally anything else. \n\n\nI used to take Xanax and I thought that helped some. It doesn\u2019t even compare. I feel like this medication is legitimately going to give me my life back. I have no feelings of panic whatsoever. I have had a panic disorder for 6 years, I haven\u2019t ever had a time, even in bed sleeping that I feel like I\u2019m not a ticking time bomb until my next panic attack. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m getting a second chance. I have never felt so normal. I feel like I actually have a shot at having a normal life, without crippling compulsive thoughts and phobias. It has relieved some of my issues I never imagined it would. \n\n\nCons: Yes, I am a bit hyper focused, but I\u2019m also more relaxed than in years. I feel like I can focus not because it\u2019s forcing me to, but because I\u2019m not getting hit with constant worry about someone breaking in to my house, getting attacked,  what I can binge on, how out of control I feel, etc. I can actually breathe. It\u2019s incredible. \n\nI will post an update once I\u2019ve been on it longer, but I just had to share.\n\n\n\n\nA little over one month update:\n\nI still love Vyvanse. There was a 3 day adjustment for me where it was pretty strong, but I adjusted quickly and ended up needing a higher dose after doing well on it for a month, so I\u2019m easing up my dose now. It gives me so much control and freedom, I don\u2019t have compulsive thoughts like I used to, and I am finally feeling rested after sleeping because I am sleeping much better. If I don\u2019t take it, I binge. I still binge with it sometimes, which is why we are increasing my dose. I actually lost 10 lbs my first month though, just because on 90% of days I wasn\u2019t binging, just eating normally. \n\nIt really made me realize how out of control it had gotten and how much it rules my life. For me, the medicine is helping show me another way to love so I can hopefully make better habits and learn to make better choices for myself.

My mind has been completely consumed by thoughts of food/weight for the past month. I can't consentrat on anything. I already have ADHD (not the super hyper/impulsive kind, more of the calm/maladaptive daydreamy kind) but this is far worse than anything I have experienced before. It's especially frustrating because it's hard to do seemingly simple tasks. Things that I know I am perfectly capable of comprehening but can't even hear over the noise in my head. But despite all of this I have reached an all-time high for me weight wise. I haven't had any free time to move at all. I feel so discussed with myself.\n\nI almost fainted in class the other day. We were about to do a presentation but right before I was supposed to present I got really dizzy. I went down to the nurse. I told her that I was probably dehydrated (witch is true).

I'm really not in a position to drop my grade in that case.\n\nI've been trying to get my grades up to 4.0 for a while. Jest got done with exams today and got my score from chemistry (a class I was previously doing pretty well in) but it actually lowered my grade instead of raising it like I had hoped. I think it must have been the math section that I did so poorly in. (Math has always been one of my greatest weakness) but still, I have no excuse for doing as poorly as I did on that test. I feel so guilty and ashamed.\n\nBut on the bright side (I guess) all of these exams got me out of a Doctor's appointment that I have been dreading. I really don't want to be weighed.

I'm 22 and 17 stone. I'm really struggling at the moment with my mental health side of things as well as my weight. I know being fit won't magically fix the imbalance in my brain but it definitely will help. At the moment I'm in the frame of mind of I don't give a fuck. I don't care about anything, about work, about cleaning, about what I'm eating, about my health. I don't care. Then I have moments like right now where I think no, I can do this, come on. I hype myself up at 2am and think tomorrow is a new day I'm gonna go on a walk and work out and eat healthy.. Then tomorrow comes. I might start the day right, have some wheetabix - or don't eat at all. My lunch at work isn't until 2, so most days I wake up at 10, go to work for 11 and then don't eat until 2. But then my lunch comes.. Our work is lovely in the sense that they have biscuits and cakes in the staff room occasionally. If this is the case oh golly I'm ruined. I will start by taking 1.. If someone's in there that's all I will take. But usually everyone finishes lunch at 2 and I'm the only one there.. I will keep grabbing bits of cakes and brownies and crisps while no ones there, each time eating it so fast I can't even enjoy it because I'm worried someone that already saw me have a piece of this cake will see me eat another piece and judge me. I then wash my hands and my face and swish water around my mouth so no one knows I've eaten it. I'm so ashamed of myself after I feel disgusting and the lack of control. If there isn't cake in the kitchen I will go to the shop and buy something chocolaty which I will eat on the bench outside so no one in the office can see, with a meal deal in my bag. I'll then go inside and eat the meal deal pretending that my packet of quavers is my treat for the day when I've just eaten 2 chocolate twists. When I get paid is the worst. When I'm sat at home on the weekend, probably hungover from the night of binge drinking, well that's a whole other issue, I don't want to move, I feel sick, I'm lazy. I drink on a Friday and drink so much that I come home Saturday morning and spend the next 2 days in bed, not moving, not washing, not doing anything. So if I get hungry am I going to go and make something? Nope. I order domino's, Chinese, burgers, all to my door in half an hour and I get something delicious and I hardly had to move. But let's remember the delivery limits in all these places, oh no, I have to spend more than \u00a310/15.. Well I better add some more food. For 1 person I get so much food. It gets here and I start eating, even near the end if I'm feeling full or even sick, nope I can't stop, it tastes so good and I've just spent money on it. Sometimes I'll leave it for 10 minutes and go back to it, but this is getting eaten tonight. Afterwards I feel awful again. I have just wasted \u00a315 that I don't have as I don't earn a lot on 1 meal that lasted half an hour when I could have gotten a few days worth of good food for work. Then here comes my depression and anxiety, then comes the binge spending where I'm so sad I want to buy nice things so I will go online shopping. Again a whole other story. I'm stuck in a massive whole of being fat, being insecure, being depressed, being anxious and being poor. And at this point I don't even know where the fuck to start. I'm starting here because I'm hoping other people will have the similar stories.. So I know I'm not just a hopeless mess. Also it's just helpful to write this all down, as a note to self even if no one reads it. To see in the future how far I've come.. If I ever get started. Good luck to me and my motivation, I just want to be happy, but I lack the motivation to do anything about it.\n\nPeace - C", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I am currently at a spot in my life where I am doing some soul searching and making life changes I have been eating better but then just have bad days or moments. I try to talk with my husband about it as I don\u2019t really have a ton of friends just due to a little anxiety and my isolated job. He doesn\u2019t get it and doesn\u2019t handle me being an emotional al person very well usually just causes a huge fight which makes me eat more. Just looking for a community and maybe people I can message on those hard days to help me get past them without eating myself sick.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

Thank you and here is my story", "author": "fatassfrank321", "self_text": "I never knew such a page existed before today. I was scrolling through and i finally feel like I am among people who actually understand what I am going through. I am not looking for pity. Please do not respond as my friends and family have with the traditional \"you're beautiful\". Fat does not equal ugly. You know? I am so sick of hearing that. I just need to feel supported and understood\n\nI am about to pour my heart out on here because I do not know who else to turn to.\n\n *Here is the trigger warning*\n\nI have been bigger since grade school. It was not ideal but I managed. I managed in unhealthy ways... Like binging and purging. Like slim fast. Like baby food and liquid diets. Other yo yo diets. All of them have proved to be failures. \n\nAt 18 I was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome. PCOS has a lot of symptoms. Feel free to look into it but it is not super relevant here except that that diagnosis essentially labeled me and i felt doomed to a fat identity ever since. I always had my moments of hiding food. Eating things I knew I shouldn't but I also knew would make me feel better. And for a fleeting moment it did. Always did. \n\nI ate because I was sad. I ate because my friends had boyfriends and they got hugs and kisses and i got fatter. I ate because breakups happen. I ate because my ex boyfriend constantly cut me down. I ate because my dad told me not to and because my brother hid the macaroni AND I ATE IT and it made me feel... victorious? For lack of a better term. It was disgusting. I ate until I felt full. Uncomfortably full. Immobile. In pain. But full. \n\n My dr. Prescribed me phentermine. \n\nPhentermine literally made me lose my mind. I was depressed. I was violently angry. I was mood swings like I have never been before. I would sob until I couldn't breathe. I stopped even looking at the mirror. I weighed myself MULITIPLE TIMES A DAY. For the love of god, do not do That to yourselves but that is what I did. I measured myself. Weekly.  I posted those measurements to my wall. I wrote all the motivational quotes in the wall. I walked nearly 10 miles every day. I never slept. I barely ate. I was a wreck. I drove myself CRAZY. My new found personality on this drug was not someone that i liked and it ruined valueable relationships for me. I have never been so insecure in my life as I was on this drug and after this drug. \n\nLast year while on this drug I walked into my doctors office and sobbed and begged him to never let me take that drug again. I asked him to do this because my boyfriend at the time told me he loved me but couldn't watch me damage myself anymore. \n\nHe left anyway. I blamed it on my weight.  Because I blame everything on my weight. Everything in my life revolves around how I think I look to other people. \n\nA year later..  \n\nI tried to lose weight the healthy  way. I went to the gym all summer long. I ate fresh vegetables and grilled chicken. I ate in moderation. I did the best I could. I did keto. Lost 20 pounds. Stopped keto. Put it all back on and then some more. I've been back and fourth to counseling. Some therapist work. Some do not. But I go for free because I'm in college and there are a few therapist on campus. So none are permanent. \n\nToday though. Today I hit rock bottom. My brothers birthday passed. I made him a cake. He left the cake untouched. We forgot the cake... well I didnt. It sat on the table for a day mau be two. My dad said to throw it away. I ate a few bites and left the rest. I threw it away... then today I came home from running errands. I washed the dishes. And there next to the sink was the cake in the trash. THE TRASH. I couldn't help myself. I ate cake from the trash with my bare ass hands. I haven't done somthing like this since before I was put on phentermine. I am so ashamed. So I cried the type of cry where it feels like your sides are shaking. And I called my doctor. \n\nAnd I want to be back on phentermine. I'm not sure if I should but I'm going to ask him away. I dont know if he'll give it to me but this time I really feel like I need it because the binging is uncontrollable lately and it's making me feel so worthless. \n\nI don't know why I vented this out to strangers but I feel so defeated and so lost but this is the only place I've finally felt okay to say this at. \n\nThank you for listening.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

You'd think being the only vegan in a meat eater family and bying my own groceries would somewhat limit my binging possibilities, right? But, well, bread exists. Like during the day I actually manage to eat somewhat balanced (I'm trying this whole intuitive eating thing) and I just don't by my biggest trigger foods like biscuits, crisps and ramen noodles (I'm weird ok), which has been working just fine. But for some reasons the last five days in a row, I've just absolitely gone crazy binging on bread at like 2am. My sleeping schedule is pretty fucked so I've found myself being awake super late at night and being really hungry lately. So because I'm doing intuitive eating I wanted to \"honor my hunger\" and just have a small snack, but as soon as I started eating I just couldn't stop and idk why. I'm definitly an emotional eater, but I was feeling totally fine on all of these days. And it's not like I hadn't consumed enough calories during the day, because I try to really pay attention to that now, having previously being stuck in a binge/ restrict cycle. But I've stopped restricting months ago because I literally don't even give a fuck about my weight anymore, I just want to stop this stupid senseless binging. I feel so bad because my family isn't well off financially and not only do I, a 21 year old, still live at home and make very little money, but now I also fucking stuff myself with tons of bread that I didn't buy myself. And yes I have tried buying my own bread and keeping it in the freezer so I am limited to that and can't easily eat like 10 slices in 5 minutes but that didn't work either, because I knew there was an easier option, that there was bread my mom bought right there on the table. It's so shameful. My mom doesn't mention it anymore because she knows about my struggles with food and would rather just ignore the problem because every time we try to talk about it it end with me crying and having an absolute breakdown. But I know that she notices that huge amounts of bread have just gone missing and it makes me feel like a horrible person. I really don't know why my body reacts to bread that way. Like I don't restrict myself bread, it's not like I want it because I can't have it, I eat bread in normal amounts almost every day for breakfast or as a snack so why is it somehow so special at 2am when I'm alone in the kitchen. That's the other thing. It#s not even an \"enjoyable\" binge, like I used to do, where I would just devour huge amounts of sweets and junk while watching netflix. No, it's just me sitting there alone in the kitchen, literally eating slice after slice of plain bread. What the hell? I thought I had binging somewhat under control, because intuitive eating has been working pretty well for the most part, and now this? And I can't just tell my mum to stop bying bread. I don't even know, I just wanted to write this down to clear my head I guess because I feel so stupid an ridiculous. Does anyone have some advice or maybe some experience with intuitive eating? I feel so discouraged because at this point it seems like I actually binged less while I was still restricting and being generally very unhealthy and disordered and if I can't stop these stupid late night binges it makes me actually consider going back to my old ways, even though I was really comitted to have a healthy relationship with food. i don't know, it just seems so pointless, like when is this ever going to stop?", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I just want to get it off my chest because I can't talk to anyone IRL about it. \n\nI have been taking a medication for awhile that is contraindicated for EDs/ED history because it's the only one that has worked and that I haven't had a bad reaction to, and I think my therapist probably felt my ED history (I was AN b/p with just p) was distant enough that it was fine - I didn't ask because I didn't want him to change his mind. However, my therapist doesn't know that I have never fully shaken the ED voice in my head and have gone through a couple periods of relapse/quasi-relapse, with two very significant \"purging disorder\" relapses in the last few years that scared even me. I've been too scared to tell anyone because a) I don't want to be monitored, b) I need this medication and don't want to be taken off it and c) that good old ED thrill of having a secret/feeling in control etc, oops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been dancing around a borderline underweight BMI for the last year or two after having gained to a totally normal but abnormal-to-me BMI (I've always naturally been at the low end of the BMI spectrum, part of what propelled me to ED territory yay) for a couple years during a very bad depressive period. No one noticed or said anything about the weight loss from my \"heavier\" weight, I think it was so gradual and people just know me as being thin-ish so I just look normal for me to them, maybe? Now I have just been prescribed an additional medication that I need, but it also fully kills my appetite and this is where the potentially bad situation lies. I'm secretly kind of thrilled about the no appetite. I feel amazing. It is helping me to make better food choices when I do eat, which is great, and I am trying to get lots of protein and healthy stuff in and \"eat enough\". However, I can already feel the ED voice gaining strength and even when I try to challenge it, sometimes I literally can't keep eating so it makes it so easy to just cave to what the voice is telling me. And that feeling of being clean and empty, oh my gosh. So I'm just in this fucked up situation of being kind of concerned about losing more weight somewhat unintentionally and it being noticed and then probably getting taken off two meds that I genuinely NEED to function, while also being like, excited about where this might go in terms of losing weight?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just don't know what to do. I feel like talking to my therapist about this is not an option because I absolutely cannot afford to be taken off these medications. I am also scarred from past experiences where every interaction with my therapist/whoever becomes focused on ED stuff and weight, etc. instead of other shit I actually need to deal with. I am trying to stay healthy and do what I know is right, but the ED is just so so tempting. I KNOW they destroy lives and bodies and I absolutely also cannot afford to fuck up all the progress I've made in my life, in school etc. I'm terrified of dying. I'm terrified of ruining my body any more than I already have. I watched a recovery video recently that reminded me of how much being in that place sucked, when I was afraid of WATER for god's sake. And I don't want to go down that path again, I keep forcing myself to remember how miserable and scared I was... but damn, that voice. I feel like I am split up the middle, ugh. I'm probably just worrying too much and I'm doing a good job of not letting it take over so far, but I just feel guilty for the voice being there at all, you know?", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

It started with medication. I was diagnosed with depression and started on anti depressants several months ago. One of the side effects I experienced was a loss of appetite. I guess it's fairly important to the story that I am, and always have been, overweight. I noticed one day that all of a sudden I had lost close to 15kg in one month. \n\nIt was both kind of scary (because I know it's not really a good thing), but I just loved seeing the numbers on the scale go down. I hadn't weighed this little in YEARS. So when I felt my appetite coming back, I just... didn't eat. I don't really have anyone watching me eat, so I didn't even have to pretend. When I was \"making dinner\" I cut up a bell pepper and washed some grapes, took them to my room, had a little bit of the food and threw the rest away. I didn't really think it was a \"real\" problem, because I am still overweight. Nobody looking at me would ever think I had an ED. But one of my best friends started getting really worried, and he said that he wanted me to tell him how I was doing, and if I was struggling I've been talking to him, and he can usually calm me down and talk me through the worst of the issue. \n\nHe's living abroad for the school year, but I just managed to go visit him for a week and I came back last night. I was finally able to weigh myself this morning (he doesn't have a scale) and it was like a nightmare. I had gained weight while I was visiting him. I decided to reach out to him because I was so close to a panic attack, and now he's saying that if he were braver, he'd call my mother and tell her what's going on. I really don't want this out, I'm just not ready for that, and now I feel like I can't talk to him anymore. I can't trust that what I tell him will just be between us. \n\nI kind of got worse that ever today... this weight gain really screwed me up, plus the whole thing with not being able to trust my best friend anymore. So I ate a little at dinner tonight and then I felt so awful that I purged for the first time. I just could not NOT do it somehow. \n\nNow I feel guilty, sad and confused, because the purging actually did make be feel better. \n\nI'm sorry for the rambling...

I've been overweight my entire life. I grew up in an unhappy home with an alcoholic mother and an absent, but very nasty dad. When other relatives found out about my mothers alcoholism and after a string of events (she lost her driving licence and nearly died), I went to live with my grandparents, my grandad was terminally ill and my grandmother was very loving, but had a very bad temper, she became unwell in my late teens. I also managed undiagnosed epilepsy until I was in my mid-20's (I had a diagnosis of panic attacks and fainting from age 7), I am now medicated with anti-convulsants.\n\nI have always used food to self-soothe. \n\nWhen I was a teen, friends of mine self-harmed, and other kids used drugs and drank excessively.. and I used to feel proud that I was able to 'cope' without resorting to such things.. unaware that my use of food was a form of addiction, a form of self-harm. I was badly bullied for my weight as a teenager and resorted to unhealthy measures to try and lose weight, to no success. \n\nMy weight has yo-yo'd in my adult life, though I have always felt the same size, and I've always seen the same person looking at me in the mirror. I have worn clothes from UK size 12 to 26. \n\nAfter the death of my grandmother and diagnosis of epilepsy, I dropped out of university. I was a UK size 14, weighing about 210lbs. My acne quickly returned, and I slipped into comfort eating again.. shortly after, my best friend attempted suicide. By the end of the year I had ballooned to over 330lbs. \n\nOver the 3 years that followed, I have lost 110lbs. I still see the 330lb+ person looking back at me in the mirror, in pictures, in reflections as I walk down the street. I am obsessed with losing 50lbs, having skin removal surgery and being 'normal', but I hate myself so much, I just can't find the motivation to make it happen right now.\n\nI wear a fitbit HR, I have been eating at a 500-1000 calorie deficit, counting calories using myfitnesspal, resistance training and exercising using my stationary bike.. but my weight hasn't budged in weeks. I am so exhausted from depression, that I can't find the energy to give more. In the last few days, I have just given in. I ate at maintenance, but I know that if I wasn't really losing at deficit, I will surely gain at maintenance.. \n\nI went on holiday recently, and all I felt was nothing. Apathy. Food is the only thing that is bringing me any pleasure, comfort, joy. Why am I depriving myself something that takes me to my happy place, when I can't find happiness in anything else right now? I'm trying to heal a heartbreak right now, so I thought, maybe it would be a good idea to try online dating again. All I've had is guys either fetishising or soliciting me. I feel so dirty, degraded and gross.. Just by having a profile.\n\nToday I ate a box of cheese twists dipped in cream cheese, 2 duck breasts, polenta, asparagus, and peas with beef gravy, and a slice of cake, and 3 chocolates. All I could think about was heading to the freezer and eating a tub of ice-cream, but I managed to resist it. 2131 calories, with drinks (coffee and orange juice).\n\nAnyway, that's me and my vent.", "subreddit": "FoodAddiction"}

My mom is throwing a Christmas party right now for all her coworkers.\n\n\nEarlier this year I was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). I was diagnosed fairly late in life despite it being obvious in hindsight because my pediatrician didn\u2019t want to \u201clabel\u201d me, because girls tend to present differently and with less obvious symptoms, and because it wasn\u2019t recognized as a spectrum disorder when I was growing up. Many of my symptoms are sensory; I\u2019m very sensitive to light, sound, texture, smell, and taste. Because of this, I\u2019ve had Avoidant-Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) as a comorbidity for as long as I can remember.\n\nThis party doesn\u2019t have any safe foods for me except for some crackers. At the dinner table my mom explained to everyone that the reason I wasn\u2019t eating because I\u2019m autistic. Normally I\u2019m proud to be autistic but my eating habits have always been a huge embarrassment for me. Not being able to eat like everyone else causes me great social anxiety. She should\u2019ve asked before disclosing my diagnosis to a bunch of people I don\u2019t know. To me, the worst part of ARFID isn\u2019t the sensory overload, or the intense panic when eating a fear food, it\u2019s the social stigma.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

So I had to run bent over like an anime character to my bf who is playing video games and say \"I need help I'm choking\" and he had to grab pliers to grab a spatula from my THROAT! Obviously he was like wtf what just happened and I explained everything while shaking and sobbing. \n\nI've never in my life thought I could be so close to death. I was terrified I would accidentally swallow and need emergency surgery to remove a spatula from my stomach. Please just stop. Stop lying to the people that care about you and stop lying to yourself. I need to recover, and I can't die lying on my bathroom floor with a spatula obstructing my airway.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

People with BED actually serve very well in this role, they know what it\u2019s like and there\u2019s no shame in talking about a binge who is struggling with the same problem.\n\nExercise.\nDon\u2019t go too crazy, but 4-7 hours a week of exercise puts you in a great state of mind, I recommend a mix of weightlifting and cardio.\n  \nDon\u2019t restrict!                                                Be logical; to lose weight you need to stop bingeing, but in attempting to lose weight (caloric restriction) you make yourself more likely to binge. Focus on just not bingeing for now.  After you hit a streak of 1 month binge free, then think about cutting down (if you are certifiably overweight)\n \nPlan your meals.\nknowing what you\u2019ll eat and when reduces binge urges as the simpler part of your brain can\u2019t cause you to believe you need to binge as you are threatened by starvation. Eat pre planned consistent amounts at pre planned, consistent times. Planning meals also helps with knowing when to stop when eating. I found that I work best when eating 3 meals per day +a small post workout snack.\n\nEat well! \nStuff that will fill you up, and don\u2019t eliminate food groups! You need carbs, fat, protein and micronutrients. \nMicronutrients: (fruits and veggies, any type, any time)\nProtein: (beans, eggs, chicken)\nFat: (olive oil, avocado, natural peanut butter)\nCarbs: (any kind of potato, oats, lentils)\nCottage cheese is amazing, high in protein, low in calories. A one quart tub is only 1200 calories! Keep in mind these are recommendations, whatever works for you, works for you.\n\nDiet soda, lots of it.\nNot much to this one, feeling a binge coming on? Slam massive amounts of diet soda, keeps the hands busy and the stomach full. If you\u2019re going to be drinking a lot (more than 1 liter) don\u2019t get any caffeinated stuff, it\u2019ll make you more anxious.\n\nUse a sobriety clock.\nNice way to quantify your progress and remind yourself why you\u2019re doing this, I recommend NoMo or my personal favorite, Sobertime\n\n\nNever give up\nRead this poem, and memorize it.\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus\n\nIf you binge, you aren\u2019t restarting from zero, every time you go a day without bingeing you make it easier to go another day without bingeing. You gotta pick yourself up and try again.\n\nYOU DO NOT FAIL WHEN YOU FALL, BUT WHEN YOU STOP TRYING TO GET BACK UP. WE ARE ALL GONNA MAKE IT.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I still remember the moment clearly when I decided I wanted to recover. It\u2019s a bit of a side-track but I was purging and I felt like I was about to die lol.\n\nWhen I started recovery, I weighed about 6kg more than I do now (I know it\u2019s weird I thought I would gain like 10kg kdbdbdbdndn).

I don't really know how my ED doing during this time because I didn't think I had one.\n\nRecently I realized I was doing a really good job following the definition of an anorexic.

I had a YT channel I posted on a lot a year or two ago, I told my family and it got up to 400 subs (big family(jk)). Recently I came out to my parents as bi, I also decided to come out on YT since others videos had helped so much. I forgot my uncle had sub'd and he saw it.

I've pretty much set up my personal surrounds such that binge eating is impossible. I also take vyvanse to help me even more. I've put locks on my fridge and put the keys in a heavy duty safe. All my money is put in a separate account that requires at least a business day to gain access to it, too.

However, I've noticed my father is extremely quick to send me his credit cards, and this is problematic because whenever he does I pretty much have to fight myself to not go to a store and waste another 100 dollars on utter trash using something like Samsung Pay or UberEats. I get where why he's doing it - he doesn't want me to starve or anything (which I never do to myself). But, I just feel so frustrated because regardless of how many times I explain it to him, he'll just keep doing it, and me being as unprepared and unconfident in situations like this, I just end up going for it since I barely last long trying to distract myself with other things. I feel guilty because I knew he deserves better than to basically have his money thrown away, and I deserve better than to throw my health and happiness out of the way for what feels like an addiction.\n\nFor now, I just shoved my phone into my safe.

{"post_id": "edune7", "created_utc": 1576958886, "title": "Request: Concerned about my husband", "author": "EDPostRequests", "self_text": "A couple of years ago my husband became a strict vegetarian (largely for ethical reasons; in other words, I don\u2019t necessarily suspect that it was triggered by an ED). He has always been a bigger guy and it took awhile for weight to really start falling off of him. In the beginning he was eating a lot of carbs which also contributed to him maintaining a fairly similar weight to what he had in the past.\n\nRecently, perhaps in the past six months, I have started to become worried about his eating habits. When we are at home, he eats in a way that I would say is fairly normal: stir-frying vegetables, ordering pizza, cooking some meatless frozen products/meat substitutes, etc. He works from home and occasionally he will get busy during lunch and skip it, but seems to catch up with a bigger dinner in the evening. When we are out, however- on vacation, at a friend\u2019s house, basically anything that isn\u2019t our normal routine- it seems like he gets really picky about what he is eating and it feels like if anything \u201cgoes wrong\u201d about the meal, he doesn\u2019t eat. It\u2019s hard to explain what I mean, but basically it seems almost like he is looking for reasons not to eat. Our friends/family and I try really hard to be accommodating of his diet (much to his chagrin, because he feels like it\u2019s a big fuss being made over him) so it\u2019s not at all that he doesn\u2019t have vegetarian options available. But even still it seems like he often finds reasons not to eat, and can string multiple skipped meals together (usually not more than two). The best way I can describe it is that it almost seems like he has a budding adversarial relationship towards food that manifests itself when he is forced out of the food routine he has at home. He has now dropped a considerable amount of weight, although he isn\u2019t underweight for his size (but it\u2019s noticeable to anybody who knows him).\n\nI\u2019ve tried to do some online research about signs of an ED in men but his situation doesn\u2019t seem to fit a lot of the examples I found. I feel like for every point in favor of my concern, there\u2019s a counterpoint that indicates maybe it isn\u2019t a problem. I want to talk to him about it, and I\u2019m willing to, but I don\u2019t want to go into the conversation uninformed, especially because I am reasonably certain that he\u2019s going to react at least initially with defensiveness.

I worry that my lack of control is why I'm gaining weight even though I know it's just because I'm eating more than 600 calories a day now. I just worry my lack of control will cause me to gain weight indefinitely. I just feel really fat whenever I eat. I also worry I'll gain indefinitely because my nutritionist told me that the two things that mess up your metabolism are restricting and grazing, but she also told me I should eat every three hours and also whenever I'm hungry. My stomach is on the small side and I can't eat much at once, so I'm hungry almost very hour unless I eat till I feel sick. I'm worried I'll eat too often and continue to mess up my metabolism and gain weight indefinitely. I'm also afraid I'll overcompensate and eat too much in my attempt to recover because I'm supposed to not have \"bad\" foods that I don't eat and I'm not supposed to count calories. I'm also not really that underweight, I have a bmi of like 17 or something, so I feel like any weight I gain is unnecessary. I also got my blood work done, and all my levels are completely normal, and my calcium is even a little high.

Been a while since I\u2019ve posted. I\u2019ve been in \u201crecovery\u201d (aka just eating something at least everyday) for the past few months but I\u2019ve realized that no matter how hard I try to fight the voices despite going to multiple therapists it\u2019s still so hard for me to eat, etc with my parents around or at home. \nI still live at home and do not have the finances yet to move out (goal) but my family environment is SO toxic and triggering I sleep in my car at times or just drink a lot to tune them out or the arguing out at times.. I\u2019m actually afraid I\u2019m becoming an alcoholic. \n\n\n We all love each other deep down but there\u2019s so much strife with the family it\u2019s just too much. I desperately want to get a full time job so I can save up more so I can move out because I\u2019ve just been self harming and not eating more and more lately due to my family. My therapists are so worried for my safety they want me to do residential treatment... I\u2019m sort of on the fence and scared to be candid about doing it. I\u2019m not sure what to do because I don\u2019t have the strength yet to have a full time job yet that would help me get out of the house more so I wouldn\u2019t be in such a trigging environment yet that is the very thing I feel would help me eat more because I wouldn\u2019t be around my family. If my Mom even walks in the room I automatically spit out my food.. it\u2019s terrible. \n\n\nMy entire family guilts me all the time for my ED.. even though they try hard not to say things. Ugh my parents yell a lot too and again I end up sleeping in my car. I hate it and feel like I\u2019ll always exist in this unsafe place... including being stuck in my ED forever. It seems like my body can\u2019t go on this way too.. it\u2019s giving out for sure.  If we do go on family outings like dinner it always ends up with me ordering like 3 drinks and maybe eating something.. which the last time I did my mom said something SO triggering I went and cried in the bathroom. I know she didn\u2019t mean it to be but my mind is just so far gone it can\u2019t take anything rational anymore.\n\nThank you for reading this if you did :) \n\n&lt;3 Venice", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Give that person a hug, ask how their day went, smile at them. They might try to push you away but don't give up even if they hate you for it in the moment.\n2. **Do your research.** Seriously. There are many things that you should not say or do. There are also many types of eating disorders and the behaviors and mentality that go along with these eating disorders vary. Doing your research can also prevent you from asking questions that will hurt the person with the eating disorder.\n3. **Don't guilt trip them.** Calling that someone or their disorder fake, self-centered, or other things like that will just make them feel worse. Chances are they already realize that what they are doing isn't normal and that it might be hurting others. You can bring up this point but don't just tell them that they are terrible.\n4. **Give them options.** You may try threatening them to eat but a lot of the time this fails as the person will just deceive you as much as possible. Instead you could try to do things such as going shopping with them or getting them professional support.\n5. **Respect their wishes.** When you hear that someone you love or even a stranger is going through something this terrible your first reaction may be to help them by telling others or professionals. *If the disorder is serious and they may die, do not do this, but* you may want to talk to them first. If you go find help for them without them even being a part of this, they may resist the help. The people you find may also not be understanding and from experience, this will not help.\n\nBy no means are these rules completely accurate and each person varies.

I was made to be terrified of gaining weight when I was a kid so I never ate and became underweight. \n\nAfter going through some trauma in my later childhood I began binging around the age of 10/11. This led to weight gain and my first time being obese, let alone overweight. \n\nIn my teen years this turned into binging and purging but guess what? I was still fat. \n\nRight after high school I went from 270lbs to 170 in 4 months. 350 cal a day and working out every morning. Sometimes morning and night. I'm 5'7. Still overweight and maintained that for most of 3 years, aside from a period where I began restricting heavily and got down to 130. But eventually I made my way back to 170.  \n\nWhen I was 21 I moved back home. Been back for 5.5 years as of now. The first two years back were constant over eating and binging. I got up to 320. Then I worked my ass off for 8 months and I'm 185 now. Been maintaining that for a year ish. \n\nI also began a binge/purge/restrict cycle again about 6 months ago. Still overweight. \n\nI've gone to countless doctors. I've had therapy and been to clinics. I've done so much and I feel like I'll never get better. Mostly because I feel like there's nothing to get better from because I don't have a REAL eating disorder. \n\nI'm not 100lbs and restricting ir purging, so how does anything I do count? \n\nI've been told repeatedly that I'm too fat for an ED and I just want attention and that IT'S FINE that I purge because I should lose weight anyway. \n\nI don't know what to do anymore. I don't even know if I want to get better because, since I don't have a real eating disorder, there isn't anything to get better from. \n\nI'm sorry I'm so repetitive and probably making 0 sense but I just needed to vent. \n\nI hope you all take care of yourselves, this is a lovely community and you ALL deserve happiness and healthiness and recovery and good lives.

We want to avoid this on the day *and the days after Christmas*. (For me it\u2019s always worse the days after because I feel so shit about what happens on Christmas days.)\n\n\nSo, here we go;\n\n\n**Bring your own food.**\n\nMost likely at least few people will be contributing dishes on the day - make and bring something along you absolutely know is safe and you can eat if everything else is too scary. \n\nOur safe foods are all different but a few ideas would be:\n\n- Platters. Fruit, cut up veggies, crackers, cheese, hummus, dips, anti pesto, meats, whatever you\u2019re comfortable with. Easy to chip away at and sustain your energy throughout the day without feeling like it\u2019s too overwhelming. \n\n- Salads. You can have a big plate full of salad and no one will bat an eye. Lots of veggies, but you can also add things like strawberries, boiled eggs, beetroot, dressings, nuts, cheese, croutons, meats/faux meats, tomatoes, pomegranate, onions, etc (probably not all together but some interesting combos are really good)\n\n- Veggie bakes. I\u2019ve made huge veggie lasagnas that were incredibly delicious and seemed super normal. You can use things like low fat cheese or vegan cheese alternatives or even cashews/potatoes blended up with nooch to make a cheesy sauce to bake a bunch of veggies in. Add in tomato sauce and pasta/pasta sheets (I use GF ones) (or layers of starchy veg like potato and pumpkin) and you\u2019ve got yourself a pasta bake/lasagna without oil, cheese, gluten or meat. Of course it\u2019s not the same as the real thing but with a lot of strategic herbs and garlic, almost as good!\n\n- Desserts! I\u2019ve made so many nice and \u2018safe\u2019 raw vegan brownies/cakes/etc, but also things like meringues (egg whites + sugar/sugar alternatives), healthy cookies and cakes, parfaits, apple crumble and sugar free soy-custard, the possibilities are endless!! Just make sure you try it before offering it to your family, because some recipes really don\u2019t work. \n\n**Wear something nice but also comfy**\n\nEveryone eats more than they usually would on days like this. One day will not significantly affect your body or weight. One day of overeating and not compensating will **NOT** make you gain pounds and pounds of fat. \n\nSo wear something forgiving. Wear something you feel confident in and also has room to move in. Skinny jeans, bodycon *anything*, tight waistbands - all no nos. \n\nI\u2019m in the Southern Hemisphere so it\u2019ll be warm on Christmas Day. I\u2019m wearing a beautiful flowy dress that covers my legs and belly and makes me feel great. \n\nPrevious years I\u2019ve worn: T-Shirt dresses, Maxi dresses, rompers/play suits, knitted stretchy high waisted pants and a boob tube, flowy high waisted pants and a matching crop top, stretchy high waisted skirt and a light knit baggy sweater.\n\nIf it\u2019s winter where you are: Perfect! Rug up and get cosy in clothes you love. Or wear a big ugly sweater and look cute as hell doing it.\n\n\n**When people offer you food you don\u2019t want**\n\nSmile and politely say \u201cNo Thank You.\u201d And return to conversation. You don\u2019t need to justify *why*, just leave it at no.\n\n**If you receive food presents**\n\nDon\u2019t freak out, you don\u2019t need to eat it in front of them to show your gratitude. If you think it will trigger a binge and/or purge, you can later re-gift it to someone else over the next couple of days, or give it to another family member the next day. But I strongly recommend allowing yourself to enjoy it in moderation. One year I got a box of 30 beautiful artisan dark chocolates. I had one every second or third day until March the next year. It was lovely to have a gift for that long and to always have something to look forward to in a day or two. I liked it so much that dark chocolate is something I\u2019ll still treat myself to every other week and I\u2019m able to do so with moderation and genuine pleasure. \n\n\n**If people comment on your weight/looks/what you\u2019re eating or if someone gives you the \u201cyou look so *healthy/good* and your brain twists it negatively**\n\n1st option: if it\u2019s malicious/negative - ignore that person and move to someone you like. Don\u2019t give them power over you.\n\n1st option part 2: shut them down with full force (there\u2019s always at least *some* drama on family get-togethers)\n\n2nd option: for well-meaning comments - this one is up to you. Remind yourself that most people do not *get* eating disorders and meant whatever they said from a place of love, encouragement and caring. They love you and honestly just want to see you live your life fully. They don\u2019t want you to suffer. \n\nLooking healthy is a compliment. You\u2019re glowing, you\u2019re radiant, you\u2019re bright and alert, you\u2019re warm and affectionate, you look *beautiful*. You look beautiful for more than what a camera can capture. Our eyes see so much more than the physical.\n\n\n**General Hecticness**\n\nA lot of us thrive in routine, habit, structure. This disturbed can be extremely scary and stressful. \n\n- You can give yourself structure to the day by writing out what\u2019s going to happen, roughly. Things like:\n\n{wake up 8am, shower, wear x and x, finish wrapping presents, 10am drive to Mums. 11am-4pm Lunch at Mum\u2019s. 4pm-5pm Drive to Dads. 5pm-9pm Dinner with Dad and family. 9pm Drive home. 10pm cuddle with [pet/partner] and organise my gifts.}\n\n- Give yourself time outs whenever you need them. Go to the bathroom or sit outside for a few minutes and re-group. I carry essential oils to smell whenever I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed, find what works for you. \n\n- Hang around your favourite person. Could be your same-age cousin or your quite old grandpa. Could be your dad or mum or bf/gf or your aunts cat. Your little niece. Whoever you need it to be. \n\n\nI know some of these won\u2019t apply/won\u2019t help some people because we all do different things and have different familiars but I hope it helps someone, or just prompts someone to have a think about how to prepare themselves for the day and hopefully a bit of harm reduction too.\n\nFeel free to add anything!\n\nE: Formatting\n\nE2: I love you guys.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

It seems like the weight I've gained this time round is stubborn and refuses to go )': Also, it's not like I can fit back into my old clothes, so it makes me even more depressed. I *seem* to be doing everything right, and most importantly, I'm not binging anymore. But the changes are taking so long to come and I'm really afraid I will be stuck in this weight and ugly body (and mind) forever. I can't wait to go back to my weight pre-relapse, which was literally half a year ago. I'm so angry and ashamed that just within half a year of binging, my whole life has been turned upside down...\n\nIs anyone facing the same situation as me? I've considered going back to intermittent fasting (16:8), but that was the sole reason why I had my really bad relapse this time round. I underate for a long period of time, and although I managed to lose a lot of weight and seemingly felt \"happier\" in my new body, I didn't know that I was depriving and restricting my body so much. )\":\n\nI really don't know what to do now, I still feel major social anxiety when I'm out of the house, and I have lost all confidence in myself (when I didn't have much to begin with)...\n\nEDIT: I posted this same post on the loseit subreddit and I've gotten responses telling me to count my calories. Honestly, I've been there and counting calories only make me want to binge more. I realise that obsessing over calories and eating times (like IF) only cause things to go haywire /:", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

Basically, now at 21, I\u2019ve been in binge-restrict hell forever.\n\nRecently, I think I pinpointed the ~ultimate root~ of my problems with binging, which is a feeling that if I don\u2019t eat ALL THE FOOD RIGHT AWAY RIGHT THEN AND THERE, I won\u2019t know the next time I\u2019ll get to indulge again. I think it\u2019s due to a combo of my parents having had a habit of hiding food just from me when I was younger (and, in retrospect, NOT FAT), and my own chronic problem with severely restrictive short term diets.\n\nSince I kind of pieced that one together, I\u2019ve been working really hard to stop myself from binging, or even overeating, as much. Last night I realized I wasn\u2019t hungry in the middle of eating a cheeseburger with my family and literally threw it away???? And I caught myself eating my FAVORITE DESSERT OF ALL TIME THAT I ONLY GET ONCE A YEAR past the point of fullness, and was able to stop myself, wrap it up, and save the rest for later. I\u2019ve snapped out of some binges before they were totally FUBAR!!

I stopped counting calories and watching what I eat and have just been trying to listen to my body\u2019s hunger cues for almost a month now. I was trying to get out of this ed for good, and I haven\u2019t weighed myself in around a month as well. Lately, I\u2019ve been able to see without even needing to weigh myself that I have gained weight, so I headed over to the gym for the first time in a week or so. I don\u2019t have a scale at home but there is one at the gym and I couldn\u2019t help but check my weight to see how much I might\u2019ve gained. I started last month at 125 llbs on a bad day, 120 on a good one. I\u2019m 5\u20197\u201d, so I was on the lower end of a healthy bmi, and when I weighed myself today the number went up to 133 llbs. I feel disgusting and disgusted with myself for letting myself get so fat. Why is it that the moment I start to eat what I\u2019m ~supposed~ to eat(1500-2000 cal a day for a 19f) I gain so much weight? I\u2019ve never gained weight this quickly and easily before and now I feel like I need to starve again just to get back to where I was, and my jeans are getting tighter, I can barely squeeze into some of the clothes that used to easily fit me. I wanna talk to someone to get my head out of this negative self talk and body image so that I can still eat normally, but I feel like eating normally might not be worth getting fatter and feeling awful about myself.

I used to have a very good relationship with food, I ate relatively healthy and a variety of foods, I didn't worry nor think about food, I never binged and so I effortlessly maintained a BMI of 17-18..... I even welcomed the idea of weight gain even as I knew I was on the thinner side. \n\nI did try counting calories in the past but was always like 'meh this is stupid' and didn't even think of the number much....I thought 1,500 calories was low as hell lmao. I also would intermittent fast without thinking it just came naturally as I was not hungry until lunchtime. \n\nWell when I started purging last year I massively dropped weight and got down to a much lower BMI.... I barely ate anything and I was doing very intense cardio and heaps of walking daily. I looked great and everyone complimented by body and said I had a great body. \n\nFebruary hit ... started binging like 6-7 bowls of cereal before bed kind of thing and wasted all of my saved up money on binge food so I got no savings lmao. I did purge but like 1-2 weeks. Then I started counting and restricting between 1,000-1,200 calories but then would binge. So I had the binge/restrict cycle. Then I started trying to past and basically I was constantly binging and restricting. I could not concentrate in class as my brain only focused and researched food and calories and shit. I went up to a BMI of 19-20.... still on the lower end of healthy but as I was much smaller for most of my life this sudden and drastic change was awful mentally... I was also very swelled up too. \n\nNow I do not restrict or try to and I eat normal amounts but I still get sudden binges and binge urges and I still think of food 99% of the time even tho I am trying not to go to bad habits. I am still binging very badly for no reason and I cannot stop wtf do I do :( I want this ED gone but despite not restricting just simply obsessing over food is causing binges not restricting and I became addicted to the feeling of binging.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I consider myself to be 98% recovered - I can eat and I want to gain weight more than anything, it\u2019s just stopping the impulsive thoughts and some minor behaviours. In the beginning of my recovery and even during my ED, I could eat massive amounts of food and not feel full or bored or have my body reject it in any way. My cravings were always there and I always at least had an idea of what I wanted to eat. However, recently I\u2019ve noticed I just can\u2019t finish my meals or snacks. I have a huge appetite and I am constantly hungry but I don\u2019t crave anything. I also have a problem with actually cooking food - I literally just cannot bring myself to do it, the most I\u2019ll do is pasta or bunging something in the oven. It can be my favourite meal or favourite snacks, but I take a few bites and then my mouth gets bored and I can\u2019t even swallow. If I try to make myself eat, I gag. For example, I used to be able to devour a whole packet of bourbon biscuits in one sitting with no problem. Then go on and eat some more. Yesterday my calorie intake wasn\u2019t as high as I\u2019d like it to be so I went to eat a packet of bourbons before I went to bed, ate 3 and could not eat anymore. This is really frustrating because I want to gain weight so badly but eating is physically hard for me. What can I do?\n\nTDLR: After I take a few mouthfuls of anything, I become physically unable to chew anymore or swallow. If I try force myself I gag.

Out of all the mental illnesses I have, anorexia is the ONLY one that people literally do not even TRY to understand at all", "author": "TheShortGerman", "self_text": "I just don't get it. In addition to my eating disorder, I have been diagnosed with Bipolar Type 1, PTSD, anxiety, and struggle with addiction/alcoholism. Out of all those diagnoses, the only one that people literally don't even bother to try to understand is the anorexia. Most people are extremely empathetic about the PTSD and anxiety, and while bipolar is misunderstood sometimes, people don't make as many ignorant comments about it as they do my ED. And when I explain the brain chemistry behind the mental illness, they get it. \n\nBut I've got good friends of mine who I have told time after time about my struggles with ED over this relapse the last 4 months and they continually just don't get it. At all. Why is that? Why is it so difficult for people to empathize with EDs? My friends who don't have alcoholism somehow still manage not to say triggering stuff about that and can respect my boundaries, and they get that being an addict isn't a choice, but something I have to manage regardless. My friends who don't have anxiety are still capable of comforting me during a panic attack. My friends who don't have PTSD understand why seeing a man who assaulted me in public can cause me to spiral. My friends without bipolar may have never experienced mania or suicidal depression, but they believe me when I say I am miserable and in pain. Yet, when I confide in people about my ED, it's always the same sorts of things, over and over. \n\n\"Well you don't look bad, you still look healthy\"\n\n\"I mean, 800 calories a day isn't that little, just try eating a bit more between meals\"\n\n\"Purging is nasty\"\n\n\"oh yeah, I didn't eat like anything today either, I just wasn't hungry\"\n\nRANT INCOMING\n\n1. People do not understand the serious medical implications of struggling with an eating disorder, particularly when it comes to long term restriction and purging. You do not have to be 70 lbs to die of an eating disorder. \n2. Why do people need physical \"evidence\" of an eating disorder being bad before they give a shit? No one needed evidence when I relapsed into drinking, My grades were still perfect and I drank alone so people didn't see, but when I told people I was miserably drinking myself into a hole every night, they believed me. No one said some ignorant shit like \"well you're not drunk right now so clearly there's no problem.\" Or when I say I'm depressed and considering suicide, no one says \"well you don't cry 24/7 so you're fine.\" Why are the physical indicators so necessary for eating disorders to matter?\n\nGuys, I'm honestly so upset. Every person I tell about my eating disorder either gives the stupidest advice (try a protein shake, etc) or tries to force feed me or  compares their experience to that time they lost their appetite due to the flu or says I'm being stupid by starving myself. These are good friends of mine who are super understanding and kind and empathetic when it comes to my other mental illnesses. \n\nWhat is it about eating disorders that make them so much harder to understand or empathize? It upsets me because I feel like my friends aren't even trying. And if they are, I don't feel like eating disorders are so complex that you can't see that continuously making body comments (either positive or negative) or other rude/offensive reactions might be detrimental to me. It makes me want to isolate and never talk about it again and just starve myself to death alone in my house.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Where he could be himself.\n\nSo if you had a rough day today, just know you weren't alone. Your experiences and thoughts were unique to you, but you had brothers and sisters around the world who know how you felt. They felt it too. And they are thinking about you now. I'm one of the them.\n\nI've re-written my letter to Santa tonight, and hopefully he'll be able to deliver the last minute change. I honestly couldn't care for a material thing in the world right now. All I want for Christmas is... a box full of self-kindness. Let's hope I find that under the tree in the morning.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I lived with my parents at the time it started and she was going abroad, focusing on her studies, career, etc.\nSince I was in high school still, my parents were able to \u2018force\u2019 me to go into an inpatient treatment (not really force because the end decision was mine, but I felt I had no other choice).\nIn hindsight it was the best decision, as it got me far, but even now, after being discharged for 4 years, I\u2019m where I want to be. I know it\u2019s not my sister\u2019s fault, but I do find her eating disorder to be a huge trigger for me. During treatment they dismissed this as she wasn\u2019t diagnosed, so they thought it was something I \u2018made up\u2019 or led myself to believe.\nBut now there\u2019s really no denying her eating disorder. She has admitted it herself and has been going to therapists and healers on and off for the last two years or so. \nThis is of course a great improvement, but I can\u2019t help but feel triggered by her eating disorder. She is still controlling her food meticulously, exercising a lot and maintaining a very low weight/bodyfat %.\nJudging by my clothing I know I\u2019m not fat, but every time I see her I feel like I want/need to lose weight and relapse. I\u2019m having a hard time letting go of this when I feel like I\u2019m twice her size.\nPeople generally say to avoid triggers, but I love my sister and will not shut her out of my life.\n\n\nSorry this is such a long post, but what I\u2019m meaning to ask is: does anything have a similar experience and tips on how to deal with this? I really don\u2019t want to relapse and want to get fully recovered, but feel like this is holding me back so much.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

Already feeling like crap because it\u2019s late and I don\u2019t want to exercise too late. Then my cousin is talking about how she ate so much and was bloated. She says \u201cI need to go throw up, I should just become bulimic.\u201d As an anorexic with purge subtype, I wanted to die at that second. I just looked at her. Throwing up all the time is not fun. Is it still funny when you ate 200 calories and threw up because you were planning on fasting that day and you need to get rid of the extra calories and then punish yourself? Is it still funny when you weigh yourself multiple times a day? Is it still funny when you wish you were dead for eating a single cookie? Is it still funny when all you think about is food? Is it still funny when you fear falling down the stairs because your so dizzy? Why do people think it\u2019s acceptable to joke about eating disorders? Also earlier in the night, my family joked about how I\u2019m \u201c60 pounds\u201d. Like thanks, I\u2019m not but now my fucked up brain says I\u2019m a failure because I\u2019m not. Also, another cousin of mine joked about me not owning a gun making me not an American. I don\u2019t have a gun because I\u2019m mentally ill. If I had access to a gun, I\u2019d be dead. The chance of failing by shooting yourself in the dead is very low. But the chance of failing by other methods is higher and the fear of failing and making my life worse had held me back. Of course, maybe my cousin doesn\u2019t know I have 3 mental illnesses. I don\u2019t think anyone in my family knows. My parents know I have an eating disorder but that\u2019s pretty much it. It was still an insensitive comment. There\u2019s countless reasons people can choose not to have guns that have nothing to do with their stance on guns. I\u2019m not anti-gun. I believe in gun control but I am not anti-gun. I don\u2019t have a gun because I\u2019m mentally ill. That\u2019s it. I don\u2019t trust myself with a gun. I want to die. I hate my family. Besides the triggering shit they say on the regular, they are insanely toxic and rejected me when I came out. But they act like nothing ever happened and their behavior after I came out didn\u2019t deeply wound me. Yet I know the vast majority of my family would not attend my wedding if I ever even get married. My brothers, my step sister (maybe), my great aunt and uncle, and my cousin on my moms side. Out of the dozens of cousins I have and all my aunts and uncles, that\u2019s all that would attend. So I don\u2019t buy any of their fake \u201cI miss you\u201d\u2019s. You made the choice to not be an active part of my life when you told me I chose to be gay and didn\u2019t apologize for the way you hurt me when I told you how you hurt me. None of them seem to understand mental illness so I just sit and suffer in silence. This turned into a rant. I just don\u2019t really have anywhere else to vent.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I remember throwing up intentionally for the first time around the age of 7 or 8 just because I was uncomfortably full. It didn't really become a calorie control thing until around the 5th and 6th grade and even then it was very sporadic. I gained some weight after some trauma and going off of Ritalin around the time I was 13, and by the time I was in the eighth grade I was binging and purging all the time. I never got professional treatment for it because my parents didn't \"believe in mental illness\" and I continued binging and purging pretty heavily until I was around 17 and a half. I always thought I was \"recovered\" but looking back on it it was just addiction transfer. I felt a little better about myself after losing some weight due to lots of partying and never eating. The drugs filled the void the way binging and purging did but were so much better because it was fun. This probably sounds stupid. But anyways I recently got sober. I've gained some weight over the years, especially this year because of sobriety. It's hard to deal with sober, it's not like it's ripping me apart. Seeing my body change is rough but I can deal with it. I'm grateful for my sobriety and want to stick with it, but recently I feel like I've been binge eating so bad. It's not even like binge eating, to the point of being extremely uncomfortable, like pre purging binging. It's just always eating. I eat when I'm happy, I eat when I'm sad, I eat when I'm bored. I know I don't need it, it's a waste of money and food, it makes me feel bad. But in the moment it makes me feel good. I know it's just a replacement for drugs and booze and it's better that the former, but it still makes me feel shitty because I know I'm just using another unhealthy coping mechanism to avoid my problem. I don't know how to stop. Willpower? Therapy? I guess I just have to make a life I don't want to escape from, that's what everyone who's sober says, but like I love food. It's a social thing, I enjoy cooking, I enjoy trying new food, I enjoy rewarding myself with food, I enjoy watching movies and eating. I know it's a hedonistic pleasure thing, I've always been an overindulgent person with no moderation when it comes to anything. But I feel like I've never eaten this much besides during binge sessions pre purge. I don't know. I don't really know how I feel about it, I dont think it's like a life ruining problem but food is 100% my favorite part of everyday and I dont think that's healthy.

We were talking over snapchat about The Witcher and various other things, while sending funny snaps back and forth. He sent me a snap pic of a particular scene &gt;!(Where Yennefer goes through the brutal process of changing her body)!&lt; that exposed quite a lot of a woman and I commented back that I thought her body was great (without really thinking about it because I'm way too used to looking up thinspo and sent the snap way too fast to take it back).\n\nHe responded by saying, \"I like your body too.\" And he continued, \"I liked all of you. So cute.\"\n\nSo this is a me problem, but I really dislike being called cute, because it makes me feel like I'm going to be nothing more than cute to him and it feels less than in comparison to other words (pretty, beautiful, gorgeous, sexy, hot, etc.). I know it's in my head. It's just that I already have a terrible perception of myself as it is, and him using no other words besides cute feels like I'm just meh. And the fact that he used \"so cute\" to describe my entire body makes me want to puke, because it makes me feel like my body is just ok, but it's not any better than that. (The last time we saw each other, we came close to having sex, but didn't. I'm happy that didn't happen, cause I know that my thoughts would have been much worse than they are right now. Regardless, he still saw my entire naked body.) I'm also short and something he said before when we initially met was, \"Shorter than I thought, but it worked for you.\" I told him before I  met him in person that I was 5'2 when he asked, so I don't know why he expected I would be any taller. Which again bugs me that he calls me cute, based on my height.\n\nAnd to make things worse, we said a couple more sentences about that particular scene and the outcome of it &gt;!(Yennefer goes from being a hunchback with a crooked jaw to being completely beautiful). !&lt;\n\nHis response to that was, \"Yea she's gorgeous now.\"\n\nOh god, it triggered me so much. I know it's my fault that I sent that stupid snap back. But damn, now I'm comparing and my ED is kicking into overdrive. I'm feeling so inferior and I can see every single flaw on my body. I just want to starve myself so I can feel just a little bit of worth and control.\n\nThe fact that he used \"so cute\" to describe my body while describing the actress as \"gorgeous\" defines the stark contrast in my mind between me and her. How I need to improve my body because it's so meh, while she has become the unattainable goal that I will still try to achieve. I don't expect him to call me gorgeous...I just wish he didn't describe my body at all. If he called me anything else, I still wouldn't like that, because I wouldn't believe him anyway.\n\nSo now I don't want to be touched by anyone and I want to isolate myself so no one can see me, because my body perception is going out of control. I also want to fade out on him, because I feel too hideous and have too much fat on my body for him to see me. My fucking mind is telling me to go on an indefinite fast, to gain some control back.

As a young kid (i\u2019m sure like many people) Mcdonald\u2019s and junk food were like the biggest treat of my life. But for me  I would literally cry when I was unable to get junk food as a kid. I remember my older brother telling me at 11 years old that I was addicted to food but ofc i never took it seriously. \n\nWell, this obsession didn\u2019t stop there and as an adult after years of basing my life around food and dealing w abuse, mental illness, etc. I found myself literally gorging myself on junk food/ordering delivery 3-4 times a day. I literally never cook +  the depression plays a huge part in it since I self isolate constantly and never eat at the table.

I\u2019m stuck, and I truly don\u2019t know what to do, i didn\u2019t think it was serious until my mom was looking at me in shock with all the deliveries and the amount of food I consumed on the daily. \n\nI hope someone out there in a similar situation has advice that worked for them.

I\u2019ve gained 20lbs in the past year. \n\nWhen I came home for break last winter I\u2019d been at my lowest weight and was restricting below 500; my friends convinced me to tell my therapist, who sent me to a nutritionist on campus and pushed me to refeed. I let myself eat regularly over the summer, which I didn\u2019t spend at home, and kept it up into this past semester. And now I\u2019m relapsing hard and trying to lose weight again.\n\nThe first thing my dad said to me when I stepped into the house was, \u201cYou need to start losing weight. It\u2019s unhealthy to be this fat.\u201d (I\u2019m in normal BMI range for my height by a long shot.) My mom comments at least once every few hours about how much fatter I look and how, \u201cYou don\u2019t fit into your old pants, do you?\u201d While eating dinner on my first day back, they ordered Papa John\u2019s pizza &amp; wings and said, \u201cShe eats so well, no wonder she\u2019s gained so much weight.\u201d We\u2019d just spent the whole day moving into our new house.\n\nI spend my breaks working at my dad\u2019s sushi restaurant, which is mostly staffed by older Korean adults. Every. Single. Damn. Day. Someone assumes they have the right to make some fucking comment about how much weight I\u2019ve gained. Shit like, \u201cI guess you just gain more and more weight each time we see you?\u201d and \u201cLook at her, she\u2019s so chubby these days.\u201d \n\nYesterday while at work, I had a complete mental breakdown in public. I was trying not to cry behind the host stand. My dad came over to ask what was wrong and I just fucking broke down in front of him. I told him how every single time anybody sees me they make comments about how fat I am and how much it fucking hurts. I promised him through my tears and rage that I\u2019d stop eating for fucking good if that\u2019s what everyone wanted from me. One of the sushi chefs, who\u2019d commented just a few minutes prior, came over to apologize (I didn\u2019t respond). I was wiping tears away while giving takeout orders to UberEats drivers and showing customers to their seats. It was fucking humiliating.\n\nThis is all just to say, Asian (particularly Korean) culture regarding weight is so. Fucking. Toxic. Everyone thinks they have the right to say something that could be hurtful to anybody to me just because \u201cwe\u2019re friends\u201d and they don\u2019t give a fuck about mental illnesses. My family members have called me fat for as long as I can fucking remember, as I\u2019ve always been a chubby kid. They compare me to my younger sister, who is 5 years younger than me, hasn\u2019t fully gone through puberty yet, and was blessed with amazing genes. I\u2019ve fucking had enough. I\u2019ve never felt so motivated in my life to get as sick as I possibly can.

You didn\u2019t have to gild this, but thank you so much and thank you to everyone who\u2019s left a comment.

The whole process of making the dinner and then eventually all sitting down to eat. \n\nIn the more recent years where I've recognised my eating disorder I realise immediately the pressure of finishing my food is overwhelming and I'm suddenly not even slightly hungry. Previous years this will make me turn to old Mia, eating as much as I can get away with from my dinner and then going to the bathroom and getting rid. This would leave me with the most overwhelming shame. As a family we made this dinner, and for what?\n\nThis year, however, I've managed to eat not all of my dinner, but all of what I've ate has stayed. Its not something Ive thought about until an hour after sat with a baileys and I'm like oh yeah, I used to feel the need to do that and you know what I'm okay for it this year. Who knows I might stumble down the hill next year and slip but you know what that's fine, swings and roundabouts.\n\nI hope you're not having an overwhelming one, if it feels so, try to remember that people care for you and love you.

I don't know how many times I've begged everyone to hide sweets from me, but it seems like no one listens or really cares. I don't blame them--I know we are all busy with our own lives and there are better things to worry about than hiding some pastries or chocolate. \n\nHowever, whenever my family deliberately leaves sweets out in front of me or gives me chocolate as a gift, I will consume every last morsel of that food item, almost as if to show them how bad I am, or how bad my disorder is. Otherwise, it's like they don't take me seriously. This is very self-destructive behavior, and I know it's wrong. I have tried to tell my mother that I need professional help, and she promises to find a therapist for me, but I haven't gotten any closer to finding a professional. Should I try taking matters into my own hands in terms of finding a therapist?\n\nNo matter how many times I pull people aside and ask them to just keep their sweets out of sight from me, nobody listens. I don't know what's so hard about keeping sweets hidden in another room or just keeping them at work rather than always keeping them at home. It's even more frustrating that no one in the house reaches for sweets as much as me--in fact, most of the chocolate and bread goes untouched for days before I finally crack and devour everything. No one even gets to try what they buy. As a result, each time I feel like someone is not paying attention to my B.E.D, I will overindulge on the food they bring home, often to the point of vomiting. I am really ashamed that I do this, and I think it's highly manipulative of me to seek attention in this way. I don't know what to do. I live with my family, so I can't control what comes into or out of the house. Sadly, I don't think anyone will take me seriously unless I eventually pass out from a sugar rush or develop diabetes. It's a horrible thing to say, and I can't explain how guilty I feel. I just want them to listen to me.\n\nDoes anyone relate to this? Do you ever go overboard with self-destructive behaviors just to prove how \"bad\" you are?\n\nOn that note, today my mother gifted me a block of peppermint bark chocolate, despite me asking her many times in the past (and even this month) to keep gifts completely non-food-related. My grandmother also gave me a homemade loaf of bread. I ate the whole block of chocolate (3,000 cal) and the loaf of bread. I feel physically awful, and that's not even mentioning how bad I feel emotionally. I feel defeated. I can't do this on my own, and if I can't receive professional guidance, then I at least wish that my family would respect my wishes.

Whether I love them, barely met them, merely follow them on insta, I always get triggered when I see someone diet/lose weight and feel relieved if they indulge/gain weight. Even my friends and family. This is so hard to live with because I'm otherwise a helpful and well intentioned person, especially with my loved ones. What a horrible reaction to have, I feel fucking terrible. How can I stop feeling this way? I've tried journaling, mindfulness, actively telling myself all the right things...

But, to be allowed to go to the clinic, you have to have a BMI of at least 15, in my case that would be 39,5 kg. If you get lighter than that, you'd have to go to the stationary clinic or be admitted to the pediatric station in the hospital nearby to restore your weight, or, as I would put it, be force-fed while being treated like a piece of shit. This Monday J was weighed and was 39,7 kg, only 200g away from all. Now it's Wednesday and today morning I was 38.7. How the fuck? The only thing I ate was basically cake the last 2-3 days. And I still lost so much! J don't wanna go back into the hospital, but I just can't seem to gain, it's impossible. And I'm in so much pain right now because I ate a normal portioned breakfast. Everytime I eat J am in so much pain and so sick afterwards that I just can't anymore. I told the doctors at the station and the therapists at the clinic, but they won't take it serious. Nobody does. I just get accused all the time of relapsing and wanting to lose the 2 kg I gained at the station a while back. And yeah, I lost those 2 and am at a new LW. BUT I DO KOT WANT TO. As I was finally allowed to leave the station I was told by the Psychiatrist to eat intuitively and to throw away all the scales (food and bathroom). Well that I did, and look where it brought me. I'm just so afraid to go back there, those 2 weeks I had been there were the worst of my life. And it just seems so inevitable. I hate it.\nThanks for reading .

[Rant]", "author": "Xgx9", "self_text": "I'm starting to wonder whether I'm actually terrible at estimating/\"guestimating\" calories in different foods that I'm eating.\n\nJust a bit of background: my official diagnosis was anorexia binge-purge subtype, and my \"eating pattern\" was basically me not eating anything, and/or throwing up whatever (and I do mean whatever) I ate. At the peak of this, I was losing weight (and my health) rapidly.\n\nFast forward to today: I have been in recovery for 2 years, but unfortunately, largely due to depression, have overshot with weight gain, which now puts me in the overweight category. Needless to say, I find this new body extremely distressing, and am desperate to lose weight.\n\nSo this time I am attempting to lose weight the \"healthy way\", by restricting \"moderately\" (rather than severely), counting calories and all that. However, despite being at a significant caloric deficit (accordind to my calculations) I am not losing weight. So since I don't believe in \"starvation mode\", here goes my main theory as to why this is happening: I am actually rubbish at counting calories, esp. when it comes to foods I haven't prepared myself. \n\nThis whole situation with restriction and lack of weight loss is making my ED voice come back. In fact, I've already let myself down by purging a few times recently, as well as attempting to skip meals altogether (which is not easy to do as I live with my watchful parents). I'm becoming increasingly more self-hating and obsessive again. This is just so frustrating. Why can't I lose the weight like a normal person, just by doing the CICO, and without resorting to constant and torturous ED thoughts and behaviours?", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

It's never too late to recover and every one of us deserves the time, love, and attention it takes to get there.\n\nAbout a month ago, I saw someone reference [Brain Over Binge](https://www.amazon.com/Brain-over-Binge-Conventional-Recovered/dp/0984481702) deep in the comments on a post here. I looked it up and downloaded the book and I seriously feel like my ED has been turned on its head. I've been binge free since starting the book in the days after Thanksgiving, straight out of a binge cycle that had been going on for nearly 3 weeks at that point. I made it through Christmas easier than I ever expected, able to enjoy holiday foods without any guilt or incessant urges to cram every last thing into my mouth. \n\nSome background, if it helps. I'm a 27yo gay man, I have been concerned with my weight for as long as I can remember: I remember asking my mom for exercise equipment and weight loss pills as early as age 7 or so. I decided to stop eating for a few months in middle school (age 12) but eventually migrated to purging type bulimia, using both exercise and induced vomiting which lasted into my college years. I stopped vomiting at age 20 (went on vacation for a week and didn't have the opportunity to keep it up, and by the time I got home the habit was broken), but exercise purging remained. Over the last 7 years, I've been moving further away from purging type bulimia and more solidly into binge eating. I've tried so many things, but have always been frustrated by the feelings of loss of control around food.\n\nThat lack of control is exactly what Brain Over Binge challenges and what I feel has been the key to my sudden recovery (yes it's still early, but I feel so much different than in previous attempts). The author asserts that the urges to binge are nothing more than survival instincts from the older, animal part of your brain (lower brain), but that the higher brain (frontal lobe, where you as an individual reside) is actually the one in control of your actions. The book teaches you how to recognize the binge voice and filter it out. You don't have to fight, trick, resist, or struggle against it. Just let it say it's piece and know that you ultimately don't have to listen to it. \n\nI know it's hokey but learning to separate these voices and keep myself rooted in my conscious mind have been so immensely helpful.  As soon as I view my urges as junk mail to be filtered out rather than as an inherent need or moral failure, as soon as I am able to detach my emotions from these urges, they go away without a fight. I feel comfortable reintroducing triggers because I now know that I am the one in charge, not my ED. I still get urges occasionally, but they are so so much more manageable and they are getting less frequent all the time. \n\nI encourage anyone struggling to regain control to check this book out. I've heard there is also a podcast, but I havent tried it out. Don't give up hope, recovery is always possible! After 15 years of ED, I thought it would be with me forever, but I'm finally seeing that there is a way out. \n\nFeel free to ask me questions in comments or DM", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I\u2019ve never posted here before... been too nervous to do so. I have never been diagnosed with anorexia or seen a therapist, but I\u2019m aware I have a lot of habits associated with anorexia. \n\nI\u2019m 5\u20197\u201d and currently only just weigh 116lbs. Three months ago I weighed like 119lbs. In the past six months I\u2019ve lost around 10lbs total and I\u2019ve DECREASED my activity due to grad school. I used to run 3-5x a week or go to the gym, and felt good. Now I can barely walk up a flight of stairs and I\u2019m exhausted all the time. I want to go back to working out because it helps my brain and stress levels but I also know I physically don\u2019t have the strength to do so right now. My issue is... I get incredibly nauseous when I eat. Anything more than a few bites of food makes me feel sick and dizzy. Vegetables and fruits are better, but it\u2019s pretty consistent across all types of food. Anything with a lot of sugar makes me feel REALLY nauseous. I\u2019m barely eating 2 small meals a day now because I feel better when I don\u2019t eat. I\u2019ve had like 4 rounds of bloodwork done in the last 6 months, as well as seen 3 different doctors and according to everyone I\u2019ve seen I\u2019m in perfect health.

Or should I keep digging in the physical health possibilities?\n\nBackground information: \n\nI grew up with very controlling, judgmental parents who were obsessed with weight, health, etc, who regularly ridiculed people for gaining weight and essentially implied that doing so was grounds for being disowned. Now I\u2019ve always been extremely thin naturally- I was a picky eater as a kid and am very active, and have hovered right around \u201cunderweight\u201d my entire life.\n\nI have self-image issues, I hate every square inch of fat on me and also hate that I\u2019m kind of happy with how thin I am despite knowing it\u2019s not healthy. I don\u2019t necessarily care about scale numbers... but I don\u2019t like how I look when I gain any weight and that\u2019s something I know I struggle with.\n\n\nTL:Dr- I\u2019ve lost 10 pounds in 6 months without consciously trying to, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of underlying eating disorder issues or a possible health problem (all bloodwork is good so far) because I get nauseous and feel dizzy whenever I do try to eat. \n\nI just hate how exhausted I am and how awful I feel and how much weaker I am.

So also side rant: WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING HERE IF AM SUDDENLY SO ABLE TO EAT WITHOUT ANYONE FORCING ME (fear foods and \"enough\" while we're at it). /siderant\n\nOkay anyway, my gripe is with the nutrition advice given by dietitians when recovering, in- or out-patient. We all know that the standard nutrition guidelines in Australia and America, and I'm sure pretty much every other Westernised country, aren't ideal - especially when we know where nutrition and longevity science are going regarding things like [CRON](https://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?q=caloric+restriction+optimal+nutrition&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholart)/[wholefoods](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/processed-foods/)\u00a0(we all know about the [Blue Zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Zone))\u00a0and especially [bio-individuality](https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/diet/bioindividuality-the-new-and-simpler-health-philosophy/news-story/211195b03bed8ad6bbf214b8b78ca482)\u00a0(I realise most of these are pop-science links but I was too lazy to go find studies at the moment). Most of the guidelines are biased anyway - y'know the meat, dairy, grain and sugar industries, but that's a rant for another time.\n\nI also understand that it is important in recovery to challenge and overcome fears - we're talking junk-food here. But why, when we have all this information about optimum nutrition, do dietitians still prescribe diets to us that are based on guidelines that are clearly not designed for optimum health and well-being and instead are based off ill-informed government-prescribed food pyramids? I get what a \"balanced diet\" is (proteins, carbs and fats with adequate vitamin and mineral intake) and that as someone with a restrictive eating disorder it would do me good to allow myself to normalise all food (intuitive eating is something I'll complain about later\u00a0\ud83d\ude05). But processed food is not food, full stop. It's energy yes, but not food, not nourishing, not healthy. I know that this mindset of the pursuit of \"perfect health\" is also something I need to change, but the point of this rant is about nutrition in recovery.\u00a0\n\nNow on the topic of bio-individuality, I have only heard the mythology of the dietitian that works with the patient to tailor a meal plan. Do these exist? I'm sure all of you can relate to having your beliefs/likes/dislikes refuted as \"the eating disorder mentality.\" For example, my appreciation of \"simple and natural\" when it comes to diet and lifestyle is point-blank palmed off as restriction and obsession. I understand their caution, but it still doesn't warrant a meal plan comprised of overly processed dairy, grains and sugar that in no way can be considered conducive to physical or mental health.\n\nOkay I know I'm just angry that I'm in hospital eating \"bad\" food. I'm angry at myself for not being able to do it \"my way\" outside all these years, but still this is one part of eating disorder treatment that I really think needs to change.\n\n**TLDR; even though we need to challenge the eating disorder, why do dietitians give us unhealthy meal plans based off ill-informed western food pyramids?**\n\n\\*Exhales\\* Thanks for indulging me lovely people, I'd really appreciate your thoughts\u00a0\ud83d\ude4f", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I want to be healthy.\n\nI\u2019m underweight and struggle to keep any weight I do get on.\n\nI just want to be healthy. And look healthy. \n\nThanks guys", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

So what did I do instead as soon as they left the house? You guessed it, I fucking binged. On christmas cookies. We have like ten huge containers full of cookies that my aunt made (she always gets a bit carried away) just standing around and I've managed to resist eating them since saturday, but not today. I just went for it. I had so many I can't even remember. Probably over 30 or something slightly stale cookies, just straight out of the box, trying to be somewhat quiet because one of my other brothers is still at home. I haven't completely lost control like that for a while. Yeah I ate way to much the last few days but it was chrsitmas and I ate surrounded by family. Not like this today, shamefully stuffing my face. And what did I do afterwards? Something I promised myself I would absolutely not do anymore yet here we are. I made myself throw up. But I couldn't do it in the bathroom because it would have been too loud, our house has really thin walls, but I joyfully announced to my brother that I was going on a walk and proceeded to purge in the middle of the  forest close to our house in the freezing cold for like an hour and it didn't even really work. Now I am absolutely exhausted, cold and felling so fucking disgusting. Who spends their day like this? I could have seen my little niece, had some fun but no, this is apperently my life now. Tis can't be my normal. I seriously can't keep letting this happen.

Since the beginning of us dating, he has mentioned on and off how he used to be fitter and 40-50lbs lighter and wants to lose some of the weight he\u2019s gained. To add context, at his lowest weight he was extremely skinny for his height, and he\u2019s still relatively skinny now. As someone who works out on a very regular basis, I have always been supportive of being active and eating healthier. I keep on telling him he doesn\u2019t need to lose weight but that if he wants to be healthier, I\u2019m all for it.\n\nNow to add context, I use working out and staying active as a way to keep old disordered eating habits I have under control. It prevents me from wanting to starve myself, and I\u2019ve equipped myself with enough knowledge to know how achieve my own personal goals. Through knowledge and therapy, I have been in a relatively steady recovery for about 3 years. \n\nThe reason why I state this is because I\u2019m beginning to worry that even though he has only known me in my recovery, that I\u2019m influencing him negatively. He tried purging, and I had to talk him down from it. I\u2019ve been able to keep a steady, clear mind about this but he even told me he\u2019s never felt the need to do this and doesn\u2019t know why he felt that way. I\u2019m concerned about him. I don\u2019t know if this is related to a mental health issue he already struggles with (anxiety related) or if it\u2019s something else. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to bring it up with him or if I should at all. As someone who has struggled with pretty severe disordered eating habits, I know when people would point out the fact I wasn\u2019t eating, I would just find better ways to do it. \n\nIs this something I should talk to him about?

I sat down on the bench and cried, shook and hyperventilated a bit more. A very kind woman came over to me and asked me how I was doing and comforted me a bit and wished me a good day afterwards.

Easily 4,000+ calories a day. I am so bloated and I have already gained 3 lbs, but I know I will gain more in the coming days because my mind is constantly focused on food and I just cannot stop eating. \n\nI do know that I probably need to gain some weight, but these binges are just so distressing and especially the aftermath is so horrible - I feel not only physically uncomfortable but also psychologically terrible: depressed, lonely, guilty, frustrated and incapable of thinking clearly. Plus, there is the constant urge to purge via vomiting, which is becoming louder and louder as I gain weight. While most people would just dismiss a few days of eating too much as not that big of a deal, I believe only people with EDs can understand the deep feeling of depression and hopelessness that I am experiencing right now.\n\nMy mom and my friends try to comfort me by saying that it's only normal in my situation and it has happened multiple times in the past wherever I had a relapse and lost weight. But I am still panicking. I can (somewhat) accept weight gain but I'd like to have a more structured day instead of these wild binges. I need some calm and serenity instead of this constant feeling of anxiety, dread and impending doom, and most of all I just need to be sure that it WON'T last forever and that I will be fine, because I truly cannot believe it now. :'(", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

Being offered a free place to stay anytime. Being told that I can be a Korean actress multiple times by strangers and many more.\n\nI'm aware that most people don't get such preferential treatment. I enjoy being treated well across the board. I know it sounds stuck up. But I do and I can't lie.\n\nBut what happens when I gain and become heavier than what I'm comfortable with? Invisible.\nIgnored. Suddenly noone is as bothered with my preferences and opinions. \n\nBest friend told me I was getting *fatter* and I should eat less cos I looked disgusting. Plus he's gay so he's extra honest and sassy about it. \nPaying for my own meals (clarify that i support gender equality lol but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy it when ppl insist on paying). No extra toppings - boo.\n\n Likewise many more that I could go on and on but you get the gist - being treated more 'coldly', lesser people offering to help.

It's just harder for people to think that.\n\nInfact, most people with an ed started off with weight gain and feeling fat, whether it be an extra 3kg or 30kg they put on.

But I don\u2019t like that narrative. It doesn\u2019t sit right with me. My eating disorder has made me who I am. It\u2019s a part of me and always will be. While it may have stolen my life and my true self, it will always be a part of me. So maybe it *is* the eating disorder, but it\u2019s me too. I like to talk about my eating disorder as a demon in my head but it\u2019s not going away. So when I don\u2019t eat all day and then eat a small meal when I planned to fast for 48 hours so I purge and over exercise? That\u2019s me. It\u2019s my eating disorder but it\u2019s me. I can\u2019t snap my fingers and just stop listening to my eating disorder. Believe me, I\u2019ve tried. It doesn\u2019t work. I can fight this all I can. I can gain weight and get to a place where I\u2019m eating normal. But at the end of the day, I\u2019ll still have an eating disorder. I\u2019ll still have thoughts of purging and burning calories and eating nothing. I\u2019ve been told when you\u2019ve been at this recovery thing for long enough, the thoughts are quieter and less frequent. But they are still there. You can\u2019t separate me from the eating disorder. I once said to my dietitian \u201cI don\u2019t like that it\u2019s hard to measure jelly and it has a lot of sugar so that\u2019s why I don\u2019t eat it.\u201d And she said it\u2019s my eating disorder that doesn\u2019t like it. Ok fair but I\u2019m the one that acts on that. I am the one with the feeling, not my eating disorder. My eating disorder is not a person. It\u2019s not a demon even if it can be compared to one. It\u2019s a mental illness. It\u2019s a part of me. It can\u2019t have feelings because it\u2019s not a person or an animal. It causes my feelings. I can understand how seeing the eating disorder as your whole personality is bad and allows it to be stronger. But can I just acknowledge how terrible this makes me feel and how stupid my behaviors can be without someone saying it\u2019s my eating disorder? Sure if I didn\u2019t have an eating disorder I would do these things or feel these things but I do have one so I do. It\u2019s a part of me and I hate the narrative that I should separate the eating disorder from me. I can\u2019t.

At my PILs and I said no to dessert, as I\u2019ve decided to give keto style eating a go, as it sounds aligned to what makes me feel genuinely full. That was a great first step, as MIL is an indulger like I am. She lets me know there\u2019s a tin of  Cadbury roses should I change my mind, as she and I often enjoy sweet treats together so she knows me saying no isn\u2019t usual!\n\nThe night goes on and my husband is enjoying spending time with his brother and having a drink, so he doesn\u2019t want to go home yet. I\u2019m soon super tired and honestly, a little bored. Next minute, the roses tin has been cracked open and I\u2019ve got a stack of empty wrappers in front of me. \n\nI looked at the wrappers and for the first time in ages, I knew exactly why I wanted them. I was tired and needed rest. Had I have gone home at that moment and done my bed routine, I have no doubt I wouldn\u2019t have buckled and eaten any of my usual binge foods. \n\nThis lightening bolt moment that sounds really dumb and obvious in hindsight really stopped me from reaching for another chocolate, and also meant when I got home I didn\u2019t go hunting for a way to continue the binge. \n\nMoving forward, I know the way to curb my binge behaviours is to be more firm about my needs, especially those HALT emotions (hungry, angry, lonely, tired) and act on them.\n\nHappy holidays, my fellow peeps!

It's even worse when it's someone I know but I don't know well enough to express concern and expect them to listen.\n\nI was really happy to find this subreddit at first because I could finally help some people, or at least try to help them. I would go pour my heart out to a few people with the 'struggling' flair but I feel like I can't make myself to more than like three at a time. And then I take a break for like a week. It's somehow even worse to HAVE the opportunity to help someone, but then fail. Everyone I've given advice to has been super gracious but I can't help thinking that I could have done more. I could have said something better. With the right recipe of words I could have saved their life, but I didn't. I know that's mostly just in my head, but I can't help it. So I stop going on reddit to make myself feel better, then I feel guilty for not at least TRYING to help people who need help, I get back on, and end up feeling like crap again. I have to admit that reading about people's struggles is triggering some of the time, but most of the time it's just the shame that is the biggest problem for me.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? How can I move past this? And, of course, how can I better help someone who is struggling (on reddit and irl)? What can I say?

Some time ago, I moved out, my daily routine changed and I started loosing weight without even trying. I assumed it was because I stopped drinking sweet drinks and was busy most of the time. I lost some weight and was not overweight anymore, according to BMI.\nThis year, I am studying in a foreign country. As it is more expensive here, I developed a habit of eating only 2 meals per day and some snacks. Also some stress was added and because of that I was able to eat only one meal a day sometimes. \nAnother thing is, that cooking here is almost impossible for me. Options for what to eat are not that various. That sometimes makes me overeat, when I finally can eat something different and I only feel sick afterwards, which makes my mood drop and I feel bad, almost depressed.\nI lost 7 kilos in 4 months. I am still in the healthy weight range and I like that I lost more weight but I am worried I lost weight too quickly. I don\u2019t really worry about my weight that much, only that when I go back home, I will have to be careful to not gain all the weight back quickly.\nSome of my friends asked me if I am anorectic.

Here's my situation:\nI am currently dating a girl who I already know I love (even though it hasn't been too long).  I've never felt so strongly about a person in my life.  We both have type 1 diabetes, so I feel like I can connect with her on a deeper level that I haven't found with anyone else.  She also suffers from an eating disorder, so I want to know how to help her as best I can, so I thought I'd go to reddit of course!\nI'm not sure what she suffers from exactly, but she isn't bulimic, anorexic, and does not suffer from binge eating (those are the only three eating disorders that I know of), though I know eating disorders can come in many forms and at varying levels of severity.  Her issues seem to pop up at different times, especially the holidays.  I usually let her vent to me about it and just listen and comfort her, but I want to take it to the next step.  I don't want to simply help her cope with it, but also be able to actually help her overcome it.\nShe seems to feel anxious and guilty about eating at certain times.  She's extremely fit and loves working out and has a fantastic body, but she seems to have a skewed view of her own body.  Most of the time, she's very good at getting rid of her i-need-to-be-skinnier-right-now thoughts, and she feels most in control when going to the gym and working out.  Her anxiety and guilt pops up most when she eats out a lot or indulges in a lot of food, two things that happen a lot during holiday season. \nDo you guys have any tips for me?  I just want to be able to help her in any way I can, and I want to make sure I fully understand how to navigate the topic!  Again, excuse me if I said anything ignorant in this post, I don't mean to offend anyone.\nThanks so much!", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

Feelings are talked about a lot and everything is open to discuss. Recently we\u2019ve both been under a *lot* of stress due to the holiday season, and our respective ED have started to make an appearance in our daily habits, without either of us really realizing until the past couple of days.\n\nI have been battling anorexia for as long as I can remember. At some point in college I began intermittent fasting as well as intuitive eating, which I still revert to during times of stress or helplessness. I unintentionally reverted back to these habits during the holidays, and unfortunately have lost a noticeable amount of weight.\n\nMy boyfriend has battled bulimia for over a decade and still falls into the \u201cchew and spit\u201d routine occasionally. He was overweight as a child which has caused him to have severe body dysmorphia as an adult. He lost a lot of weight last year from changing his diet and habits, and he fears that he won\u2019t be able to keep it off. He\u2019s been binging a lot, and I\u2019ve caught him chewing and spitting today.\n\nWe\u2019ve talked about our respective disorders and linked behaviors, and we feel confident going into 2020 as a unit that we\u2019ll be able to stay on the right path, but I have fears for myself. A big part of why my habits are so dangerous is that I don\u2019t even realize that I haven\u2019t eaten for multiple days until someone points it out to me. I don\u2019t notice the weight falling off until my bones are jutting out of my skin, and at that point it\u2019s already gone too far. I genuinely don\u2019t know how to fix this without setting an alarm for each meal.\n\nMy boyfriend is awesome and checks on me regularly to make sure I\u2019ve been eating, which is extremely helpful, but *he shouldn\u2019t have to*. I also have started fearing that my unhealthy habits are pushing him closer to his own disorder-based habits because he\u2019s began chewing and spitting again. He has a poor self-image due to body dysmorphia, and I don\u2019t want him to start hurting himself because I\u2019m hurting myself.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

I used to chew and spit my food so I could taste it but not consume the calories. I would hide the bags of chewed up food in my desk. I wouldn\u2019t throw them away until they got full because it was \u201cwasteful\u201d. My room smelled terrible. I wasn\u2019t a slob. But because of chewed up food, my room smelled disgusting. I\u2019d take my dinner back into my room and I\u2019d chew and spit it to make my parents think I was eating. Then I\u2019d dump the milk they gave me down the toilet. Nasty, I know. My emotionally abusive dad was going through my stuff one day to see if I had something he was looking for. He found my bags of chewed up food. I panicked and lied and said some boys threw it at me at school. When my parents were about to go to the principal, I broke down and told them the truth. They acted like it was all for attention and I was fine. I told them a few months later I was starving myself still and suicidal and I wanted to see a doctor. My mom refused to take me because a normal doctor would just give me pills. I cried at a fast food restaurant once because I didn\u2019t want it for dinner. My mom said \u201cI wish you\u2019d just get over it.\u201d I just got better at hiding it. Since then, I\u2019ve starved myself on and off. When I was \u201coff\u201d, I convinced myself I wasn\u2019t sick anymore. I ate like twice a day. I still obsessed over what I ate and felt guilty every time I ate. Still exercised solely for burning calories. Still hated myself and thought I was too fat. I just wasn\u2019t actively starving and eating under x amount of calories a day (at one point I was eating less than 200 calories a day). I didn\u2019t get help for my ed until 4 months ago. Anyway, going back to high school. Shortly after my parents found out about my eating disorder, we were visiting friends. We\u2019d moved away a few years ago (11.5 years now). The daughter of these people, who was a year younger than me had sexually abused me as a child (don\u2019t want to go into detail). Her mom said she was in treatment for anorexia. My mom was so empathetic and concerned. She was glad she was in treatment. Yet she wouldn\u2019t get help for her own daughter? It felt like a jab to the heart. Like she was saying this girl who really hurt me for years growing up mattered but I didn\u2019t. My parents also found out a year earlier that I was self harming. All they did was get angry. To be honest, my parents caused a lot of damage to me and I resent them for it. How can anyone find out their teenager is cutting themselves and not get them help? Then how can they find out that same teenager has an eating disorder and not do anything? They\u2019ve always acted like my mental health issues was for attention and just a sinful choice. But with other people\u2019s children, they care? I don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m 23 and I am finally getting help no thanks to my parents. And guess what, I do have an eating disorder. And PTSD and depression. It wasn\u2019t just for attention or being a bratty teenager.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I'm also an adult.**\n\n\\-------------------\n\n**Short summon of sickness history**, ^(might have a saying in your estimated reply.) *\\[Feel free to skip if lazy lol\\]*\n\nSo, I've struggled with overeating/ under-eating my whole life. I started developing a restrictive ED back in my teens, and managed to get back on my feet with the help of a meal plan and threats from my at that time doc to inform parents and hospitalize me if I didn't. I wasn't too deep into it so it went pretty ok.\n\nNot gonna go into what happened because I probably have a irrational fear of someone finding out who this is lol. But something very dramatic happened in life, and I started binge in my late teens/ early adulthood. Got obese. Was obnoxious to my binge ED.\n\nAlmost a year ago now I relapsed heavily on my restrictive and purging ED. I have periods of up to weeks at a time where I B/P 2-4 times a day at an average, but its been up to 7. I have also vomited a bit blood at least one time.\n\nThen it shifts to restrictive/ fasting that lasts 1-2 weeks.\n\n**TW NUMBERS:**\n\n^(For reference, bit over a half year ago, my BMI was 31,2. Today it is 19,6. My mom tries to convince me that I'm underweight but, not rly according to my BMI. Yeah, she weights more, but she's taller, and have more mussel mass, she still has a smaller fat percentage. Anyways, I digress.) \n\n^(I've lost about 2-4 kg a month.) \n\n**Some other physical symptoms I have**, is hair loss, I can see I have acid damage on my tongue, teeth etc. This swings a bit but I have periods of days where I feel so heavy I can barely get out of bed, or change positions. Stomach pains comes and goes, dizziness and tunnel vision every time I stand up. Haven't feinted yet though. Easily agitated. Sometimes my heart rate drops to around 40, and I think my blood pressure might be low as well. Feeling cold frequently even when its 20 degrees in my home, and I'm wearing pj's, 2-3 pair of socks, 2 carpets and covers. I sometimes get a lot of death anxiety, feeling paranoid. Having struggles to go into the store, or even into my kitchen with the lights on. Having to weight myself 10-20 times a day. Lol, just writing this makes me understand its kind of bad. \n\nLast night, I tried to fight my B/P urges, and they just grew and grew until I couldn't anymore, ended up having to leave my home at 3 o'clock in the middle of the night to buy shit to B/P on, even though I was paranoid AF of getting mugged or assaulted or what's worse.\n\nBut I'm still not underweight, but I might be in 1-2 moths if it continues in this speed idk.\n\n\\------------------------------\n\n**My questions:**\n\n**^(So, I'm finally going to be evaluated for impatience over new years. And I'm nervous. I've been to multiple different facilities multiple times, for other reasons. And it hasn't rly helped me at all, and I haven't had a good experience.)**\n\n**^(This place isn't an ED only clinic, but they're much more specialized than anywhere else nearby. I also haven't been at this place before so, I suppose, I'm both hopeful and scared. The problem is that, they only take in one patient at a time with an ED. Which I understand, because its a competitive disorder, and I'm kinda happy they don't. So, my questions, I know people don't have a set answer, but getting estimated answer, or guesses even, might calm my nerves, because I feel like I have to know what I'm going into, this is also because I have so many other problems stacked on top of it, and I have earlier almost gotten sectioned because I handled the stay very badly, because of set other problems.)**\n\n**1: If you read my sickness history, the BMI stuff and the other physical symptoms, even though I'm not technically underweight, yet(?), when do you think I would be prioritized? If at all? Is my problems still big enough to get help, or get it within a set amount of time? I'm sure there's probably a lot of people that are sicker than me and need help more urgently. Like, I'm not even underweight, will they still take me seriously? I'm rly scared that they'll judge me because I'm not sick enough, or think I'm faking it. Sometimes I even ask myself that question, until I'm hanging over the toiled bowl again that is...** ^(I'm just so exhausted of this crap and I just want to get a life...)\n\n**2: If I were to get help. How long, on en estimate from minimum to maximum do you think I'd have to stay there? Again, this would probably be easier to answer if you're from my general area, and have read the post over.. How long do you think they would want to keep me there? And how long do you think it would take for me to at least get back on my feet so I can work more on it at home? I do want to cooperate as good as I can even though I find it difficult.** ^(I just feel so stuck in it at this point, it controls every aspect of my woke life, and I can't get out of it on my own..)", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

Food has been rather healthy and my portions have not been excessive, I ate till i was mildly full which was pretty much my eating habits Before ED kicked in.\n\nNow to my point. Eating normally for the last two weeks have made me realise that it is not normal for me anymore. ED has screwed me up so much that starvation has become my normal. What I eat on a daily basis now is extremely low and eating 1000 calories is overeating to me. Then of course i ruin all progress by chewing and spitting thousands of calories. I've gone from extremely underweight to normal BMI now. Without the opportunities to do this, i realised tgat eating three meals a day is abnormal, not weighting food and counting calories is abnormal, not starving is abnormal, not obsessing over food is abnormal for me. \n\nNow I am home and alone again and I am already restricting again. It just makes me feel incredibly  sad since I never thought I would become the person I am now. Whenever I saw something about ED I was always like \"whatever that will never be me\" but honestly eating a decent amount of oatmeal for breakfast for the first time in years, made me realise how dissapointed I am with myself. Furthermore, over-excersizing has destroyed my body and my knees, I can't even run anymore and I used to be athletic and love playing, dancing and moving around.\n\nI am making a 2020 resolution, hoping I can stop my ED habits and be the active and happy person I once was.  Currently I have low expectations but I really hope to become a person I can be proud of again.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I cannot thank you guys enough for the support I received on that post, knowing that I\u2019m not crazy for being upset by my mothers actions and not being weak for being affected is very comforting. It was so comforting, in fact, that I started forcing myself to eat regular meals again. My mom did not respond well to this. Any time I put food in my mouth she was standing over me and glowering at me in disappointment, like I just took a fat bong rip right in front of her and blew it in her face. Every time I didn\u2019t take a sip from my water jug (she wants me to use water to fill up space in my stomach), she\u2019d mentally take note of it and interrogate me about it later. It\u2019s been absolute hell. I\u2019ve started panicking about food, treating it like some sick, silver tongued devil whose trying to poison me. I\u2019ve started drinking so much water that when I hiccup it comes out of my stomach and pours out of my mouth. And I\u2019ve finally developed a habit that I\u2019d sworn on my life that I wouldn\u2019t pick up. I\u2019ve started purging. My mom feels like a torturous presence in my life but I\u2019m scared to be without her. Because without her control, \u201chow else will I know that I\u2019m getting fat!?\u201d. The idea of gaining weight now terrifies me, my mom constantly antagonizing me every time I eat has lead to me feeling like the food I eat is violating my body. Having a full stomach genuinely feels like my body is being violated by the most agonizing sensation I can imagine. Tonight finally made me realize what\u2019s going on. I went out with a friend to a pizza place (them wanting to go out and get food immediately set me on edge). I hadn\u2019t eaten all day so I got some garlic cheesy bread and told myself, \u201cI can\u2019t get any thinner, I\u2019ll need a feeding tube if I do... I\u2019m fine at this weight.\u201d. My mom knew we were going out to said pizza place, after I got home and went to brush my teeth she came in and folded her arms, \u201cDid you get something to eat while you were out?\u201d. I snapped, \u201cYES mom, I DID. That\u2019s none of your business.\u201d. She said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to get fat and depressed again. Your eating patterns are unhealthy (she means that my one meal a day is TOO MUCH, not too little.). I turned to her and said, \u201cYou\u2019re constantly projecting your dysmorphia onto me, it\u2019s really fucking upsetting and inappropriate.\u201d. She rolled her eyes and continued to stand firmly by her point, saying that I\u2019m \u201cfailing.\u201d, and \u201cletting myself go.\u201d. The final thing that killed me is when she reached out and tugged on one of my fattie spots and said, \u201cSee!? This wasn\u2019t here before.\u201d. She finally realized she won when I started crying and she left the bathroom. That feeling of \u201cviolation\u201d in my stomach hit me at full force and I couldn\u2019t stop myself. I purged until in came out clear. Me losing 70 pounds wasn\u2019t enough for her. I feel fucking disgusting and there\u2019s no winning; I\u2019ll feel disgusting for eating and I\u2019ll feel disgusting for throwing up. I\u2019m starting to hate myself. I\u2019ll inspect myself in the mirror for hours just to make sure I\u2019m not fat. I don\u2019t know what to do.

A lot has happened in the past 3 months with myself and my dad (personal matters) that have really taken a toll on my mental health. I had never seen my dad take mental health days until these past 3 months occurred and I wish there was more I could do to help him. \n\nOn top of all my personal issues, I got screwed over by my university for the 7th time once again delaying my graduation to where I have to take a whole extra year to get my bachelors. My eating was slowly starting to get better, but now none of us can afford health insurance so I currently can't see doctors or specialists. I do get free counseling on campus, but they don't specialize in eating disorders. I went from eating 1/2 a meal a day at home to consistently eating 1-2 meals a day on campus despite my hectic schedule. I know that's amazing especially since it's so hard to eat on campus and lugging everything to the kitchen downstairs where someone may or may not be using it is a huge challenge, so I tend not to cook on campus.\n\nI just don't know why when it comes to being home, my eating habits are worse. I have now gone from eating 2 meals a day consistently to eating 1 meal a day. I have binge-eating disorder and I have managed to only fill my dorm with snacks that I have that won't trigger my IBS and that I won't feel guilty snacking on because they are in some regard healthier than what I could be snacking on. \n\nI guess to top off the stress, I have no idea what I want to do with my life still or what I should be doing with it and I'm in my 8th out of 9th year of college right now. I feel as though I should have really honed what I want to do at this point so I could start applying to remote jobs (my skillset allows for me to work from home and not in an office space which I really don't like). Should I choose to move out within the year, getting a remote job would be ideal since I do have someone I could rent a house with and I won't have a car for a while due to paying off debt. \n\nI have spent the majority of my last few years just lost and depressed and anxious about everything. I don't know where to begin anymore or what questions to ask or even to get myself out of bed for that matter. Do I need to move out? Would it be more beneficial to my mental health to move out? The worst part about thinking about moving out is that I feel like I'm abandoning my family as I have a sibling with cerebral palsy. I kind of feel like I'd be walking out on them in a way. I love my family don't get my wrong, but my mother and I butt heads all the time and it's really frustrating and anxiety inducing for me.\n\nI feel like I'm just rambling at this point. For a TLDR: I'm not eating well when I should be at home and it was harder to eat on campus. On campus I managed to begin maintaining at least 2 meals a day instead of 1/2 or 1 meal a day. I have a lot of stressors and feel really lost and just don't know what to do anymore. I can go into more detail should people want it.", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

And he's also a \"fitness guru\" of sorts, so when I first started working out and trying to lose weight, I would talk to him about it and keep him updated, but I was keeping all the unhealthy stuff hidden. But then I started to suspect something was wrong, and that I was unhealthy. And even though I haven't felt ready to give it up yet, I've kept dropping hints to him and a couple others because I'm getting scared and stressed. But then there were a few really obvious ones (or what I thought were obvious) that he either ignored or totally supported. The one time I was actually trying to recover somewhat, but I was battling a bout of wanting to skip a meal. I knew I just needed reassurance from someone telling me it was okay to eat, so I snapped him and said \"tell me to eat.\" And he sent me back a blank picture. And I sarcastically said \"thanks that's helpful\" and he brushed it off. Later, I was sending him my calorie deficits as \"progress updates\" on my diet plan (which were way too many) and he kept congratulating me and telling me he was proud of me. Then I straight up sent him a picture of the measurement book I keep to track myself, and I had lost inches in days. And I thought that coupled with the fact that I even keep a measurement log would tip him off, but he continued to congratulate me. So I said \"I'm hungry all the time\" and he replied \"don't worry, eventually you won't be. You just can't fall back into old habits.\" And that gave me major anxiety because not only was he supporting me in something I was starting to realize was really unhealthy for me, but he used a trigger phrase \"fall back into old habits.\" Like eating normally. He knows I count the calories of a slice of toast in place of lunch, he knows I'm hungry, he knows I'm losing rapidly, and he encourages me and reminds me I can't go back to my healthy habits. Now I'm scared that if I actually tell him, he will be like \"so what?\" or if I start to get better that he'll notice me \"falling into old habits\" and shame me.\nCan anyone relate to this?

twelve years old and feeling conscious of my body, as i had been for the previous few years. i don\u2019t remember a lot of details, but i remember trying to restrict some of my foods. once, in class, we played a game where we all sat on our desks and tossed a ball to each other. the guy next to me, who i had a crush on, yelled \u201cwoah, don\u2019t break the table!\u201d when i got up onto it. i probably wasn\u2019t even overweight yet, just in the higher end of normal. \n\n2011 - in the summer before eighth grade my mom suggested i go on an 800 calorie diet, so i did. i also walked on the treadmill for two hours a day, listening to far east movement and avril lavigne and wondering what my life would be like if i was skinny and had a boyfriend. during the school year, i developed a crush on another boy i happened to sit next to, awkwardly gave him a deadmau5 themed birthday present, and spent the whole year pining while he lusted after a skinny, pretty white girl. i joined the jogging club and was at the lowest i ever was, which is not saying much since i was still like 140 and 5\u20194\u201d.\n\n2012 - high school starts, i eat my way into the 150s, and not much happens. a very alternative looking guy hits on me a grand total of twice throughout the school year while i\u2019m waiting for my mom to pick me up. he had a mohawk, combat boots, and grungy vibe. he was a senior so that was ultra creepy but my mind still fixated on him calling me beautiful. started trying to restrict but that didn\u2019t really go anywhere.\n\n2013 - asked out for the first time in my life by the biggest loser in our grade (which i\u2019m sorry daniel, you deserved better). told my friends about it and discovered he\u2019d asked all of them out one by one, and felt worse because i was just his last ditch effort. started exercising a lot, following youtube videos and becoming quite strong. didn\u2019t lose any weight.\n\n2014 - sitting in my last class on valentine\u2019s day feeling Absolutely miserable because all the skinny and pretty girls have been showered with attention all day. my teacher calls me out and asks why i look so sad. i have to deny being sad for like two minutes before she finally lets it go, by which point i truly feel like crying. restriction enters true EDNOS mode, meaning it starts getting extreme on either end. binging and low restricting cycles commence. \n\n2015 - EDNOS has now landed me in the 160s. i\u2019ve stopped working out and eat more than i restrict due to the heavy workload of being an all-AP student. get another crush, and feel another disappointment. eating disorder has now been acknowledged and i\u2019m posting on places like tumblr and mpa. my most depressed year. \n\n2016 - graduate high school in the high 160s. don\u2019t take any grad pictures and hide my dress underneath my gown. low restrict in the summer and actually get to 152, start college, and end the year in the 180s. \n\n2017 - struggle to find friends, struggle with food, live in isolation as i dont talk to my housemates. spend hilarious amounts of money eating out, then more hilarious amounts buying diet coke as i try to fast it off. pull off my longest fast of 5 days, which i\u2019m not sure counted given that i c/s\u2019d the entire time. go home afterwards and my aunt asks me if i lost 10 pounds, which was exactly how much i lost on the fast. negative thoughts get really dark, spend a lot of time crying and scribbling hateful things to myself on my thighs and stomach. have thoroughly accepted that i am not worthy of a boyfriend or love in general bc perceive myself as too ugly and fat. at least i get back to the 160s.\n\n2018 - i join clubs and make a lot of friends in a short amount of time, move into a better apartment with someone i actually know, and even throw a couple parties. i feel confident. i get asked out on dates, and even go on a few, but choose not to take them anywhere out of my own lack of interest (which feels empowering, given how desperate my history is). yoyo as usual between the 170s and 160s. travel for the first time in my life and feel awful for being fat for it. overall, though, life improves greatly. \n\n2019 - a guy i\u2019ve been friends with for a few months asks me out, and suddenly i\u2019m in a relationship for the first. time. ever. i have my first kiss at 20 years old, lose my virginity at 21. my body and face image inexplicably take a plunge, and i avoid photographs for most of the year even though i\u2019ve somehow managed to restrict back into the 150s for the first time since college began. tell my boy about my ED, and for the first time feel heard and validated. finally, finally know what true love is, and it feels fucking incredible. still go on mpa and reddit daily to wallow in the ED vibes, but shit feels so normalized at this point i can\u2019t really imagine life without this disorder. \n\n2020s and beyond - finally get to my goal weight, marry this boy, and have a stable job and income (i hope) :p\n\nsorry this was so long!! wow. i just started typing and it all got away from me. my ED is just as bad as it\u2019s always been, but my life has greatly improved regardless and i think that\u2019s important to see. i know we feel like we\u2019re all on pause until we get to our goal weight but things have moved regardless, and i feel such genuine happiness it\u2019s insane. EVEN while being overweight and hating how i look. i\u2019m interested in all of your stories, and how your ED has shaped the big parts of this decade for you.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Oh, you wanted more?\n\n**Intuitive eating is bullshit.** I feel like I'm constantly binge eating my food because I still can't tell what hunger is. I awake hungry in the morning, but then it goes away when I drink water. Is that real hunger, then? Should I eat? Or is it fake hunger, where my stomach is empty and my body thinks it needs food?\n\n**Fear foods exist for a reason.** Just eat food, bro! Yeah, okay, let me eat all the things that I want to eat: cookies, doughnuts, pancakes, brownies, cinnamon rolls, caramel corn, bread slathered with butter. Oh, wait, those are all low-satiety, high-calorie, hyperpalatable foods that will make you obese. I'm *already overweight* from trying the whole intuitive eating bullshit, eating fear foods is just going to make everything worse. When I eat my fear foods, I crave more of them. When I eat my standard Eating Disorder Approved diet, I am better able to control my cravings. This Christmas morning was a clusterfuck: I woke up and was like \"GONNA ENJOY THE HOLIDAYS\" which involved me packing down a sleeve of Graham crackers and lime curd before breakfast. It was amazing, and I ate more later, and I would've had more the next day, and the day after that, and the day thereafter were I to allow myself.\n\n**Eating sucks.** Food is my primary stressor. Every day it's on my mind. Have I eaten enough protein? Have I eaten enough fat? Have I eaten too many carbs? I had a potato earlier so can I have this apple? I would really like a damn sweet potato but I did eat some carrots earlier so I'd better not. Is today going to be yet another day of misery and mental hunger? Is today going to be the day where I've gained enough weight that my clothes don't fit? Is today going to be the day when I finally gain the mental fortitude to endure the hunger and start losing weight again? Is mental hunger *real* hunger, or is it just my gluttony wanting to eat more food? I'm pretty sure my brain is just like, \"Ah, eating is pleasurable, go eat some more, fatty!\" And of course I have no self-control anymore--I can't handle the mental or physical hunger despite years at being a Level 7 Intermittent Faster. Which leads me to my next point:\n\n**Recovery feels like an excuse to binge.** I want junk food right now. Just give me those delicious fear foods. My therapist would say, \"Go ahead and eat some!\" Yeah, let me just enjoy that fear food and ingest another 3,000 calories for funzies. I already cannot control my healthy food intake. Portion control is laughable. Yeah, let me just have a half a cookie. Mmm, delicious and satisfying! I can either buy some fear food and enjoy it to the fullest (and thus basically binge eat it), *or* I can have a small, unsatisfying portion of fear food and be left wanting more. I'd rather *not* eat the cookies, period. But hey, if I want a sleeve of Oreos, I can *have* a sleeve of Oreos! It's recovery and definitely not just an excuse to binge junk food.\n\n**Every day brings about more food stress.** I am conflicted on every front. On the one hand, my therapist tells me to eat my fear food and eat desserts. On the other hand, she tells me that binge eating is bad, and I should practice portion control. On the one hand, my husband pushes me to try my fear foods, but on the other hand, he wants to take a break from restaurants and food-oriented celebrations because of our holiday eating. On the one hand, I want to be a normal person, but on the other hand, I want to be a stick-thin person, and on the third hand, I want to be a strong, muscular person.\n\n**I AM SO WORN OUT FROM THIS BULLSHIT.**", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Then I couldn't stop eating and I gained forty pounds from my lowest weight (BMI 19.4) and absolutely hated myself. I lost ten pounds that I had gained from stress and I still hated myself. Then I told myself I wasn't trying hard enough, and if I wanted to be thin I could, so I relapsed. And I was so scared of eating anything other than my safe foods that I felt like I couldn't breathe after meals and I'd lay in bed and cry. I gained weight again and tried so hard to be okay with it, and just when I had begun to feel normal around food and accept myself, I lost my appetite for a whole month, lost the weight again, felt awful all the time, then binged for a month until I'm back at what I weighed the beginning of the summer. All I want right now is to relapse, to be tiny and skinny and empty. I tried asking for help SO MANY TIMES but no doctor thought I had a problem because I was never skinny enough. What a punch to the face. What a fucking joke. I have a fucking eating disorder and I was never even skinny enough at my worst to get help. I lost my period for two years. Every time I stood up I felt like I was going to faint and I saw spots in my vision. I stopped being able to sleep at night even though I was tired all the time. Half my hair fell out so I cut a ton of it off so nobody would notice. I couldn't get along with anybody and I was terrible to my family. I lied to my mom about how much I was eating and I'd bike thirty miles on an empty stomach. \n\nNow I'm at a \"healthy weight\" (BMI 24.5 but I lift weights and my family is naturally broad/muscular, my normal used to be 22.4) and I fucking hate my body and I hate food and I eat it anyways. I'm healthy on the outside and everyone says I look fine but on the inside I feel like my disorder is screaming full blast. I eat all my fear foods and I feel like a disgusting pig. I feel ugly. I confided in my boyfriend about my history with the disorder and now I'm horrified that I did that because none of my friends know. He told me it wouldn't push him away and I know he'd care about me if I gained thirty pounds or lost thirty but to me that means nothing because I hate myself. Nobody will help me because I don't look emaciated, so I have spent hundreds of hours on the internet looking for anything to do with recovery, ed's, weight loss, weight gain, body acceptance, diets, workouts, etc. and I'm sick of it. I have thrown so much of my life in trying to learn how to be okay because nobody will help. I just want to starve myself until I'm really bad this time so somebody will actually help me because thinking about food and my body all the time is destroying my life.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I\u2019ve sort of just been able to go through a day without being hungry for the most part, but I have a psychiatrist appointment next week so I need to eat so that there are no suspicions. But eating has become very difficult... I\u2019ll eat very small portions of food (never more than 200 or 300 cals at a time) and half way through I\u2019ll purge it all. I\u2019ll get super anxious and just... feel the need to get rid of it. But then, immediately after purging, I go back to eating what I have left of my food?  I just feel such relief when I purge. If I eat and DONT get the chance to do it I might just lose my mind. But I know it\u2019s really bad for me, and if I\u2019m gonna eat this way I might as well just make my portions even smaller or not eat at all right?", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Our final break up led me to go from 105lbs to 150lbs. November I went back to Raw Veganism and working out everyday.\n\n\nHe\u2019s dating a 50 year old woman as he is 27 years of age. It\u2019s a 23 year gap and he quoted \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look 50 at all and actively does Yoga.\u201d I never saw a picture of her and they wanted me to perhaps merge into their poly love I couldn\u2019t. I wanted someone to love just me only me.\n\n\nAnd I found that.\n\n I am extremely triggered so much I want to be better than this woman I\u2019ve never seen her as far as weight goes I\u2019ve obsessively been losing hard to get back to 105lbs and fasting every other day with exercising. Got into my size 3/4 pants and aiming for my 00 at 5\u20199 I\u2019ll be back to modeling it\u2019s been my dream to do it big time. \n\n\nBut I want to just love myself. However with any fat on my body it reminds me of the binging I did throughout processing our breakup and I hate it. I am down to less than 500 cals a day when I\u2019m NOT fasting and add workouts. I\u2019ve been 105lbs three times in my life in my 20\u2019s and this will be the fourth. Only thing is I\u2019m concerned my current SO will not be happy with my anorexic body he\u2019s a mountain man who was helping me embrace my new curves and is a avid believer in women having body hair and being naturally curvaceous.\n\n\nAs my waist breast and thighs grow smaller I hope he\u2019ll still think I\u2019m sexually attractive. But I know I can\u2019t stop till I get to even 103lbs I\u2019m plunging hard. I want to have my model stats skinny lean body and tall figure as quickly as possible it\u2019s already helped with my confidence that I\u2019m fitting into my 3/4 skinny jeans in NYE.  \n\nI lost 29 pounds between November into January I\u2019ve been meeting my weight goals obsessively. What scares me the most is I\u2019ve lost some of my back teeth because of my anorexia. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever stop...\nI\u2019m scared I\u2019ll never be-able to love myself unless I\u2019m between a size 00 0 or 2 no matter what age I may be.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}
