Whenever I see women discussing goal weights that would put them in the underweight BMI they get downvoted, accused of having an eating disorder, and told that they would look sickly and terrible when they're underweight. \n\nThis might be controversial, but I don't think there's anything inherently disordered or unnatural in aspiring to look like the body type that *society praises more than any other. \n\nIdk this opinion might separate me from healthy minded individuals and ED minded individuals, but I personally find 16-18 BMI bodies attractive and I feel like most of *society does as well. Most VS models that walk the runway have low 16 to mid 17 BMI (and that's if we're to believe their agents I wouldn't be surprised if they were lower). Despite this I've heard on many an occasion non-disordered people in my life praise VS Angels for being \"fit\" models that have muscle tone and aren't skin and bones like \"other models\". \n\nThis is even more extreme in SE Asia where kpop idols are held as the ideal body standard, and they're even tinier than most Western models.\n\n[This video is a great example of the point I'm trying to make.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEMv9QUIzE) In this video the girl states that her BMI is 17.5. If I saw this girl walking down the street I would probably clock her as underweight, but only because I have a neurotic obsession with calculating BMI and I look at thinspo all day. I'm pretty sure no one would raise eyebrows seeing this girl at the beach or call or anorexic/sickly. Hell some people might even say she's the ideal body type (and looking at her comments section that seems to be a popular opinion).\n\nEven on Reddit looking at a lot of GW posts and other NSFW subreddits you see women who are obviously underweight get hundreds of upvotes and called beautiful. \n\nI feel like the average person doesn't see underweight unless you look like death, but when people hear \"oh yeah I'm on a diet and my goal weight is (insert underweight BMI goal here)\" people flip out.\n\nI guess the point I'm trying to make is that it's hard to hear people preach about the dangers of wanting an underweight goal weight when at the same time those people don't (usually) make a peep when models/celebrities/your neighbor are underweight.\n\n*(Obviously each individual has their type but it's hard to deny that most  Hollywood celebrities and models that people hold up as beautiful are underweight or near underweight)", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I restricted myself and worked out, and i would barely binge. The binges back then did not affect me as I used to only eat at night.

Now the problem comes down to the fact that I started hanging out more with a couple of people who I'm assuming also have problems with BED.

I'm having episodes almost every day, and I wake up feeling terrible. I'm still fit, but it scares me to death the thought of becoming overweight again.

It feels gross, think Violet Beauregard from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when she had to be juiced.\n\n**Nausea/Vomiting** - this can be accompanied with heartburn and indigestion.\n\n**Coughing/Wheezing**\n\n**Anxiety** - some people have the misfortune of having a panic attack at the same time as a heart attack because, you know, one isn't cruel enough.\n\n**Shortness of breath**\n\nIf you think you're having a heart attack and if you're capable, call your emergency number immediately because time is of the essence. I got seen within minutes so they managed to prevent clotting.\n\nAlso, if you can, take an aspirin because they act as blood thinners and can prevent clots from occuring, which in turn prevents blockages and further damage. A comment on here rightly suggests chewing it as it will help the aspirin take effect quicker! You can't heal heart scars unfortunately so it's important to do what you can.

Trigger warning for the entire post because it's a sad update.\n\nI ended up waiting longer than I wanted to to address the situation because I wanted to wait for the RA applications for my college to finish since I didn't want this to influence my RD's decision, but I didn't end up getting the position anyways.\n\nFirst, I sent a text to my RA telling her that I planned to move rooms and that I'll be getting a note to give to the RD so that everything remains confidential. She encouraged me to just explain it to the RD to expedite the process. This is really hard for me because talking about my problems can be really triggering for me. \n\nIt ended up going horribly and now I'm relapsing faster than I was before haha. I hate myself for even trying. For most of the meeting, she tried to get me to agree to explain it to the RA so that she could mediate a meeting between my roommate and I. Ok. My roomie and I actually have great communication skills about everything, but this is not something I'm comfortable with anyone knowing. \n\nI kept breaking down and crying and eventually the RD agreed to move me in 2 days and gave an official notice to the new girl I'd be moving into a room with. Well, the new girl texted me and basically told me to go back to the RD and choose another room to move into. She was friendly about it as possible, but I just felt so dejected. I then had another meeting with the RD and she just told me how I should've stood my ground. But I don't want the stress of moving in to a room with someone so adamantly against it. Also, the RD told me that based on what I told her, she needs to talk to my roommate and do a wellness check kind of thing. Great. It felt like the majority of both our meetings, she kept inquiring about my roommate and it wasn't about me or how it was affecting me at all. Because I'm fat as hell and clearly I'm making it all up. She kept prodding to ask what's the real issue that's bothering me.\n\nShe also kept pushing to meet again in the future and talk more about being more open with my roommate. Fuck no. This already triggered me enough. Now I refuse to eat any time between 8am-5pm on weekdays out of fear that the RD would see me on campus. It's already clear that I wasn't taken seriously because I'm fat and I don't need to see her smug face when she gets to confirm with her own eyes that I'm fine when I'm not. Also, I'm so paranoid that she told my RA and that means I can't eat on campus at all because she's everywhere HAHA. No one takes me seriously. Maybe this is all a good thing since I would've stayed just as mentally bad forever and have killed myself, but maybe I can get skinny enough to be worth an intervention before I end my shit. Better hurry since finals are coming up and ya'll already know the suicidal thoughts come out with guns blazing.\n\nThere's only a little more than a month of school left, so I'm just gonna tolerate it. Before I left the RD's office in tears, she said \"I'll be thinking of you.\" I'm sure she will; there'll be a lot to think about when I'm gone in the future. Now I actually have something to prove. But right now, I'm just so upset with myself because I never reach out for help; even when I blacked out from just standing and my weight was less than what it was at age 12, I dealt with it. Well, the world just said fuck you for thinking you deserve any help. \n\nThanks if you read anything. Also, thank you to anyone who offered me advice. It helped guide me through a lot of the process, but I've been closed off for so long that opening up about this to a non-professional was just too much.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

A place near me has a lavender mocha (which clocks in at around 300 calories), but yet I was standing in front of you, most likely with a slack jaw and glazed over eyes, calculating calories, measuring macros, testing taste.

Like, next Tuesday soon. He's going to a three-month training program for his dream job seven states away, and when he passes the final test (he almost certainly will), he moves immediately to somewhere else. No clue where until the time actually comes, but he quite literally had three weeks' notice that he will be totally relocating his life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately, I have another year of undergrad, which means I have to stay in our city away from him. I'm terrified of our breaking up, and I'm terrified of our staying together. I'm scared that  having him ripped away from me will lead to a major major relapse. I don't know if I'm going to decide to go the starvation or the B/P route - both have their pros and cons. Starvation means I can control \\*something\\*, if not my relationship. B/P means I have some comfort and temporary happiness and relief, and yeah, I'm crying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also am (very very sadly) entirely sober, but the whole two weeks I've known, I've felt like I'm on some sort of substance. I literally feel like I'm vibrating and I think it's just the anxiety but I'm not into it. OR I feel floaty and like reality isn't actually happening to me - again, just a weird coping mechanism my brain is using because my entire home is being shattered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis sounds so fucking middle school and dramatic reading it back, but the tough part is that we know we have to break up eventually. I want kids and he doesn't; I want to live in a city and he doesn't; I can't see myself being okay with his family in my life forever, and he can't change that. It's just really fucking shitty that the time is now. I'm only 22. I could spend another two or three years postgrad loving him before I had to get serious about meeting someone to start a family with. He's my best friend and our relationship otherwise is wonderful and fun and romantic and so so happy. I can't justify over fourteen months of long distance AND moving to some podunk town in a flyover state only to break up a year later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is less ED related than I thought, but not really, even. I'm so scared from that side of things. I'm literally going to either starve myself down to fainting and nausea and forgetfulness, or I'm going to balloon up up up while eating the entire world. THAT is literally the second most horrifying thing about this. Will I do OMAD with fucking Progresso soup, or will I order two Domino's pizzas a night and tear my esophagus again? I just want to hug him. I would stop all of this food nonsense for the chance to have him stay.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I just feel lost and not sure where to go from here  . \n\nI have struggled with disordered eating for years. When I was younger I grew up with a mother who was bulimic and would constantly restrict what I ate and would compare our bodies. I would sneak food a night or when she wasn't around and binge eat, just to throw it up after. I would starve during school because I didnt have money for lunch, which would have me racing home again before my mom got home to eat til my stomach hurt and  again would purge.  My weight was around 120 during this time (I am 5'6)\n\nWhen I moved out on my own I was free to eat whatever I wanted. I also got I to a relationship and  blew up in weight to around 180 and had comments said about me, to my face and behind my back. \nMy boyfriend and I broke up, and I was miserable with my weight. I didnt want anyone to be with me as a cow which me to start restricting my food fasting for 6-10 days at a time, binging and purging then restarting the cycle. I dropped down pretty quickly to 110.\n\nThen I had a major life change which threw off my routine again. During this time I had gone to the dentist and learned I had to have 15+ cavities and fixing of my teeth from the damage purging had caused to them this triggered something in me to stop throwing up my food for the last 2 years. \nOn occasion I would work out but I would just constantly over eat whenever I had the chance and am now up to my heaviest weight at close to 200 lbs.  I feel disgusting. My face is swollen my body feels alien to me and someone I thought was a friend I had sex a while ago told a mutual friend it was gross because I was so fat and that why he \"likes to stick to skinny chicks\". I feel devastated in the confirmation that I am as disgusting as I feel. And again I feel the pull to go back to restricting and almost purged after eating with a friend today. I have a gym membership but have so much anxiety to go and I just feel lost.  I know this is long winded but I dont feel I have anyone close to talk to on this subject so it might as well be internet strangers who may in some form have dealt  with this and have any advice. \n\nAgain I am sorry if I have put this in the wrong place and I am sorry for all the long text I just need to get this off my chest and need help.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

Even though I would be considered slim/average by my friends as a short Asian girl, my whole family has always made toxic comments regarding my body. My mum and brother have a BMI of around 16 because they just don't feel hungry between meals so they don't snack in between AT ALL. Because they eat quite a lot during lunch and dinner, they manage to maintain their weights/reach their TDEE everyday. But they believe its purely genetic haha. My sister is also skinny but she actually diets and is super conscious of her figure. \n\nI was always very skinny as a kid, but I've had IBS since young and the main symptom apart from the occasional diarrhoea and stomach cramps, is bloating. I used to always look pregnant all day because I was constantly eating (although my stomach is flat in the morning) and my family would make fun of me for this, calling me fat. And I truly believed I was fat because I wasn't aware of my bloating and change in stomach size throughout the day. Jokes on them, as I gained weight during puberty, I actually became fat LOL. My sister always projects her own body image fears/insecurities onto me (ever since I was 11/12) and always calls me fat and points out my areas of insecurities (which I became self-conscious of because of her), mainly my stomach. \n\nI've gotten down from 56.5kg from May last year to 53kg currently through watching my portions and counting calories. However, I have definitely developed an unhealthy relationship with food. The main reason I snack is genuinely just because I like food and I'm so used to snacking, even if I'm not hungry, I crave something sweet or yummy. I stopped eating breakfast, and my lunch at school is always a sandwich (250 cal). When school ends I feel good and skinny. And then I reach home... I always tell myself that I'm not going to eat anything until dinner but I NEVER succeed. The first thing I do is enter the kitchen and look for something to eat. I have always done this ever since primary school and I used to just eat whatever I wanted whenever I wanted. And then I got fat. Now, I always count the calories and satisfaction level of every possible food option as I walk around the kitchen. I ALWAYS feel so so so guilty after snacking. It starts off small (&lt;50 cal) then I actually feel hungry and eat until anywhere between 200 to 700 calories. After I finish eating, I mentally scold myself that if I didn't eat that I would have been closer to my GW of 45kg and that I'm self sabotaging myself. And I feel like crying. I feel like I've binged but I'm not sure if it counts because I never eat &gt;1000 calories in one sitting and I still feel consciously in control over everything I choose to eat. Just the immense guilt and shame that follows and thinking THIS IS WHY I AM HOW I AM. I can't bring myself to purge and I'm too lazy to exercise. I always go above my daily calorie goal of 800, up to 1500, which is my maintenance but it feels like I've failed terribly.\n\nI've lost less than 2kg in the 6 months I've been trying because I always end up eating maintenance or more. Every morning I weigh myself and for the past month it has been constantly fluctuating according to my unhealthy eating days (between 53 to 54 kg). I always feel so worthless when it increases although its mostly water weight, I'm still not losing any fat, and I hate it. I can't stop thinking about how much weight I could've lost if I just stopped snacking completely from the start and ate between 800-1000 calories everyday through self-control and discipline :(( For a long time, I did really well to not eat anything after 8pm but this past week I have constantly been having snacks at 10-11pm :( I look forward to the mornings when my tummy is flat and I look AND feel skinny. I'm also always body checking myself in the mirror every time I go to the bathroom to pee or after eating LOL. \n\nAnyway I'm not sure what I wanted to say but it feels good to let this all out :) I've never talked to ANYONE about this before, not even my friends (definitely not my family). I just want a healthy relationship with food again with no guilt and feeling of failure every time I eat. I want to stop mentally calculating the calories of every single thing I eat. I WANT TO BE SKINNY BUT EAT WHAT I WANT. ", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I get no sleep. desperate for help....\n********\nI\u2019ve made posts about my ED before but I\u2019ll try to give a comprehensice summary:   \n* history of being overweight (PCOS/insulin resistance) but began losing through low carb and 1200 cal diet. lost 15 -20 lbs over 1 year (down to ~22 BMI). b/p occasionally but not often.  \n* suddenly began c/s and dropped daily intake to 400 - 700 cals per day. ate at maintenance 1 - 2x per week. this lasted about 3 months. lost ~9 lbs and got to a BMI of 19.5.  \n*during December, ate closer to 700 - 900. B/p\u2019d followed by fasts maybe 5 days that month. weekly cals even w binges never went above my calculated maintenance. I gained back ~3 lbs but my body looked almost the same.   \n* started weight lifting and increased my cals to ~1000. had sudden intense stress in my personal life. b/p followed by fast for another 5 days in January. altogether my weekly cals still averaged at or under what should have been my maintenance. within this month I rapidly put on weight placing me back at ~22 BMI \u2014 except the fat distribution has been completely different (all around my gut. also in my face, back, and upper thighs). I looked a lot slimmer at this weight last year.   \n* visited my specialists, psych, and a dietitian but thyroid levels were ok. I figured my metabolism adapted so tried to reverse diet slowly. completely stopped purging. transitioned to natural foods. I went from ~600 cals to ~1100 - 1200 now over about 7 weeks.   \n* during this time I avoided the scale. I developed gastroparesis and I\u2019m constantly bloated (like third trimester belly) and have poor regularity. I look in the mirror when the bloating is down and I see that I\u2019m fatter.    \n* after a BM yesterday I decided to weigh myself and found that I\u2019ve gained another 5 lbs this month, taking me back to where I was exactly a year ago. none of my fat has redistributed so even the clothes I wore at this weight before don\u2019t fit. I\u2019m so angry at myself, so deeply uncomfortable and pained every time I feel my body.

Unfortunately, it wasn't that simple. I think some people just have to change a few habits, I had to change my entire life.But now a few weeks later, I've lost ten pounds and I spent 21 hours in a car alone with a jar of peanut butter and it's still there, so I'm deeming myself cured. I'm going to list everything I did to provide inspiration and ideas so you can find your own cure, because that's the trick. Everyone is different and there is no magic diet or cure, you have to do what works for you.\n\n1. I gave up fasting. I do 12 hours daily, but I don't really count this since I'm sleeping most of that time. Anything longer sends me into crazy mode.\n2. I don't count calories. I have a general idea of how much to eat when I look at the label, but I was already too obsessed with food.\n3. I made exercise a priority. This was tough, as I hated the gym, crowds, and have performance anxiety and issues with my appearance. I watched YouTube videos on how to use every piece of equipment. I told myself 'just do an hour, then you can leave'. I kept pushing myself until one day, I actually enjoyed it. There's something about pushing myself to my limit that really improved my willpower in everyday life.\n4. I don't food shop hungry. This is such a big one.\n5. Here comes the extreme steps: I quit living alone and moved in with a roommate. This person wouldn't judge me if I did binge, but I just can't do it in front of other people so this has helped tremendously over hours and hours alone with a nearby kitchen.\n6. I quit my job. I worked from 6pm - 6am and this schedule ruined my workout schedule, my eating habits, my sleeping habits, everything. I blame this as the catalyst that took me from occasional binger to addict. And it didn't go away once I quit, either...\n7. ...I got rid of all food in the house. Not forever, just temporarily. I didn't want to be tempted, I didn't want to see it, I was an addict who couldn't be around the drug. I went food shopping for exactly what I needed for that day, everyday. It was unsustainable and I knew it, but luckily once I fixed my habits this didn't have to be the case anymore.\n8. I accepted the fact I had an oral fixation and psychological disposition for addiction. I sucked my thumb for too many years as a child, I had a lip piercing, I love to pinch my lip, eat, grind my teeth while I'm asleep... mom has issues with food, and I've had relatives die from addiction. It's not a death sentence, it's just something to be aware of, accept, and realize you're going to struggle a bit more than the neurotypical person. I've been diagnosed with ADHD, depression, bipolar...\n9. Now the actual diet stuff! I cut back on carbs severely. I didn't cut them out, but I'd go out of my way not to eat something I knew was high in carbs (cereal, rice, etc). I listen to body -- when you cut back, it's actually kind of accurate when your body says 'I need a pancake'. My body lets me know when it needs carbs, instead of saying to myself 'hey, the food pyramid says I should be shoving this shit down my throat regardless of how sedentary I am.'\n10. I eat enough. If I notice I've only had 2 meals that day, I have a third. So I guess listen to yourself, but know what habits send you over the edge, lol. If I've had 3 meals, I don't have a fourth.\n11. Fat, protein and veggies for breakfast. Holy crap, diet wise I can't emphasize this enough as making the biggest difference. I threw out the notion that I should be eating empty carb cereal and fruit for breakfast, and go for stuff with kale, lots of oil, eggs, etc. It sets me up for low hunger and success the rest of the day; if I eat a stereotypical breakfast, like breakfast buffet at a hotel, I tend to get sleepy and crave sugar which is a crap way to start off everyday.\n12. Oh, one more thing! Zero eating out. Now I can, but most of that stuff is extremely high in calories.\n13. I keep thinking of things to add. I never once beat myself up. I did mess up, for sure, especially at first. I didn't beat this in a day, or a week, or two weeks. I was realistic. I learned from what sent me over the edge, instead of using it as ammunition against myself.\n14. Also, be aware of advertising or social media. I had to unfollow a friend who kept posting dessert recipes; I never realized this was working on my subconscious. Same with cooking shows. \n\nPhew, I think that's everything! I hope this helps or inspires others. I don't really have the joy of recovery because I know this is probably something that will continue to tempt me during the low spots in life, but I just wanted to show that it is possible, though not easy.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

My dad works in a shop that sells chocolate and once in a few weeks he would bring home heaps of rejected samples from the shop. Then, my family would have a bit of them as dessert after dinner every night. \n\nBut of course, being a kid, i would sneakily consume a few handfuls of chocolate as snacks throughout the day. The peak of my childhood addiction was when my dad bought me a bucket of Maltesers for my birthday and i finished them all... in a single day... Needless to say, i was overweight for my whole childhood up until around 17 years old.\n\nFast forward until when i started university, i spiralled into an anorexic lifestyle due to being too busy. My schedule consisted of classes from 8am to 5pm, then dance practice from 6pm to 9/10pm. There were breaks in between but i was too caught up with homework to have time to eat, and by the time i am actually free, i was too tired so i just slept.\n\nBeing a socially anxious person made it harder for me to force myself to go out once i am in my room. i remember the times i used to just lie down on the floor after dance practice or during weekends, waiting the hunger out and go to sleep, all the while knowing that this is wrong. But i went through it anyway for 1.5 years and i lost a lot of weight, going from overweight to almost underweight. \n\nOf course, all this while the one thing that my parents would bring me when they visit me in uni is chocolate, and that was the only thing i ate every day. When my resources run out, i\u2019d just wait in hunger for a few days until i actually have time between classes to eat an actual full meal in the cafeteria.\n\nAfter that, i transferred overseas to another uni to complete my bachelors\u2019 degree. i was super stressed out at that time (i still am very stressed now) and i would buy and consume chocolate several times a week as my comfort food, and i never really gotten out of that habit ever since. \n\nFor clarification, i still do maintain remnants of my previous anorexic lifestyle (involuntarily) but it has become less extreme... as in i would have the appetite to eat one full meal at the end of each day. It isn\u2019t much but it\u2019s better than not eating for several days. \n\nCurrently, as i don\u2019t partake in any more dance practice, i compensate it with moderate cardio for around an hour a day. But the impacts have been reflected onto my eating habits. Even though i already made a habit to eat healthier, i would still heavily binge on chocolate and desserts after that, even if i\u2019m stuffed from the meal. The amount of chocolate has been exponentially increasing because of extreme academic stress and burnout as well. This habit has been creeping up on me and i\u2019m gaining a lot of the weight back recently, especially since after i started working out a few months ago.\n\ni know that the weight gain might be due to me just suddenly going from basically starving to eating a meal a day, but there was a period of time when i wasn\u2019t working out and eating a meal a day with relatively lesser chocolate consumption and my weight and physical appearance didn\u2019t change much, compared to now where i am working out but consuming way more chocolate.\n\nAnd as a cherry on top, my family has a history of diabetes and high blood pressure. Granddad had amputated his legs due to diabetes and passed away from a heart attack. Uncle also has diabetes and dad is physically fit but has borderline really high blood glucose level. So i am really under pressure to stop my chocolate addiction or else i would actually get diabetes.\n\ni\u2019m sorry that this is really long, and it seems like i blame my addiction on a lot of things except my own self lol, there\u2019s probably a lot of grammatical errors too as English is not my first language, but i hope that someone/anyone would offer some advice. thank you for spending your time reading this ramble ^^ i appreciate it!!\n\nAlso i can provide more details about this but i doubt anyone would actually ask for them\n\nTl;dr\nWhole life up until now heavily revolves around chocolate, been consuming it at really unhealthy levels recently, need advice to curb addiction.", "subreddit": "FoodAddiction"}

I've also flirted with the idea of purging but I reached out for help and y'all talked me down. I think I need help again.\n\nI got down to 99lbs when I was at my worst. I used to be fat (BMI 34) with big boobs, so I was looking a bit baggy even at 5'1\", but I didn't care. When I started \"recovery\" (read: eating whatever I wanted because obviously that's what recovery is, right?), I gained about 7-10lbs and was admittedly looking a lot better. I still don't care that my husband thought I was a little too skinny at that weight; that's honestly when I feel I looked my best. I stopped weighing a while ago because I didn't want to be triggered, but now I am truly terrified to know how much I've gained (my guess is about 20lbs, but again, I have no idea). My clothes are starting to feel tight. I hate the way my stomach looks. There are some specific items I can't wear anymore because they look and feel way too snug, including my favorite pair of jeans (which, to be fair, I couldn't wear at 99lbs either). The point is, I'm unhappy and want to fit back into my clothes. I don't feel like that's too much to ask.\n\nBut I don't know how to lose weight without starving. I have completely forgotten.\n\nI feel totally powerless over food. I want to start dieting this month with my husband (who has also gained weight), but it's like I don't yet hate my body *enough* to say no to high-cal/low-nutrient food??

It was two-three pounds from my lowest weight, nothing special? No, the shining goal was 79. See, that would mean that I was firmly out of the 80s. Being in the 80s was safe. Even with a week of binging, if I was 79 pounds, I was unlikely to hit the 90-pound barrier.\n\nWell, fast forward about three weeks. There\u2019s basically been continuous binging. I weighed myself in the middle of my binge today, and I was 109.3. That was high enough to stop it but low enough to save me from a complete nuclear meltdown. And I know tomorrow, if I manage to stay away from food and do productive treatment-recommended activities like journaling and, I don\u2019t know, looking at pictures of sun bears, I\u2019ll probably be around 108 by my appointment tomorrow. 112.5.

But I think it\u2019s something important to think about. Please read the whole thing before passing judgement. \n\nSo I\u2019ve had a bad day. Week. Month. Year. Whatever. So I decided to binge for lunch. I ordered a Mac and cheese and the lady gave me a medium instead of the small with a big smile on her face. I immediately started cursing this woman in my head. How dare she?! But now later on I\u2019m reflecting on it a bit more. She was doing something nice for me, she tried to brighten my day with something that a healthier person would have enjoyed. I called this woman, internally, all sorts of vile names even though she was only trying to be kind. And I knew this Mac and cheese would end up in the toilet anyway. I tried to justify my anger at her by saying that she didn\u2019t know if I had a health concern, but really, even if I did there\u2019s no real harm a medium Mac and cheese can do that a small wouldn\u2019t have. \n\nNow I\u2019m thinking on other times I\u2019ve done this. Friends and family I\u2019ve put down for repeatedly inviting me out to dinner when all they wanted to do was spend time with me. The bartender who gave me an extra lime because he thought I was cute. The girl in the office that left candy on my desk because she saw me crying earlier. \n\nAll of these people were only trying to be sweet to me but my disorder demonized them because of my own unhealthy thoughts and coping mechanisms. I think this is an important distinction to make. We don\u2019t want the world to become as bitter and disillusioned as we have. I know I want everyone to be a little nicer to each other, and if this is how people show it, maybe I\u2019m the one who is wrong. I need to rethink some things and address that these are my issues to work through. I need to be mad at my disorder for making me feel this way instead of innocent people who are only trying to brighten my day. \n\nAll that being said, there is a gray area. That guy who gave you regular coke instead of diet is an asshole. He doesn\u2019t know if your diabetic. The girl that gave you a dirty look for politely refusing a free sample is a bitch, she turned her politeness into rudeness. The server at chipotle who ruined your burrito with a heaping mass of extra guacamole and sour cream is doing a disservice to the burrito eating community because no one wants a soggy wet burrito with 8 mouthfuls of mush. \n\nBut in some situations I think we as disordered individuals need to take a step back from the situation and evaluate why certain things make us feel the way that they do. Is our anger and frustration justified? Or is our disorder just unhappy with the situation? \n\nI know I\u2019m guilty of letting my eating disorder turning me into a cold bitter person at times.

The post was talking about stopping focusing on numbers like weight, calories, bmi, that they were inaccurate anyways, etc. In this sub, the responses were overwhelmingly and enthusiastically agreeing with OP. In the BED sub, results were more mixed with people pointing out that said numbers do have relevance and being conscious of them isn\u2019t bad for everyone. \n\nThis just kind of made me think, because it reminds me of my experiences in the ED treatment world. Thinking about weight or calories was a complete no-no and would ruin your life. Weight doesn\u2019t even matter, unless you\u2019re underweight and then you\u2019re going to die. BMI is bullshit and calories are made up. Set point is 100% unquestioned and intuitive eating is the gold standard, unless it leads you to not eat enough and then it\u2019s bad. Overeating is only caused by restricting. \n\nWhereas what I was seeing in the \u201creal world\u201d was the opposite. This left me very confused and untrusting. What I was being told was real and was the only way to recover wasn\u2019t matching up with my experiences and prior knowledge.

I'm on the waitlist for two ED programs (one is intensive and one is less so)- and this assessment is for the program that is more intensive (outpatient: 5 days/week, 8 hours/day, though depending on the assessment, I may have to do some inpatient).  The program is publicly funded so I'm expecting to have to wait weeks, maybe a month or two before I can actually get into the program post assessment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEver since I got the call, I've been feeling more pressure (more than the already insane amount of pressure I put on myself) to lose weight.

Some days I don't eat anything but a small fruit cup and some water.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was reading online about the program and they said that even people with a BMI of 14 (severely underweight) still had to wait like 4 months for treatment.  I'm on the low end of a healthy BMI, but I severely restrict until I feel faint, so I eat a tiny bit to feel better then go back to restricting again. Such a vicious cycle. How the hell am I going to be taken seriously when I'm not underweight?

I never have a scale in my home because I know myself and my obsessive behavior, and for the last few years I was cycling with putting on a little weight, eating healthy and being relatively okay with how I looked, losing the healthy eating habits, put the weight back on, repeat. I was at the part of the cycle where I put the weight back on and I did the thing. I got on a scale. I work in a hospital so we have some laying around. I wasn\u2019t overweight but I REALLY didn\u2019t like that number, and being at the end of my weight cycling, I really wanted to be at a certain number on the scale and stay there. A coworker recommended using MFP, because that\u2019s how he\u2019s dropped 30 lbs. I was hesitant because the last time I was using MFP, I hit my lowest weight during adulthood, and I was severely under, but struggling to actually see how emaciated I was in the mirror. I finally downloaded it, telling myself I would only weigh myself once a week, I would hit my calorie goals, be healthy about it, and then move to maintenance. Lol, right? I\u2019ve stuck to only weighing myself once.. or twice.. a week. But I\u2019ve fallen back into old pattens. I was hitting my 1200 for awhile, but a couple bad binge days have TrIgGeReD me. The deep depression and feeling of failure, regardless of the scale still moving steadily downward, put me in the ED mindset all over again. I\u2019m now preplanning my days severely under my calorie goals, replacing meals and snacks with cucumbers, celery, carefully portioned and controlled dipping sauce, as well as 0 calorie drinks. I\u2019m obsessive about my reflection and the small amount of body fat on my stomach. I hit my weight loss goal, I\u2019m not happy about myself still. I don\u2019t have any intention to go underweight again, but I\u2019m striving for another 5 lbs. at the rate that I\u2019m going, I\u2019ll have attained that in a short few weeks, if less. My question is, if I hit that goal weight and want to stop, how do I even transition to maintenance from a severe deficit? How am I going to go from eating under 1000 calories a day to between 1400-1500? I\u2019ve already redeveloped food phobias, though bread had stuck with me all throughout recovery, but the list has since multiplied.

(advice please)", "author": "shiny_sylveon9", "self_text": "Idk if this needs a TW \n\nHi, so this is just me asking for some advice. About 18 months ago I had been hospitalised, not for ED reasons but for other mental health issues. Whilst I was in hospital I developed some disordered eating habits, which I had previously but had never severely impacted my life. Ex: I used to restrict but not excessively, count calories constantly, etc. However in the hospital environment this got worse. I started fasting for extended periods of time and purging whenever I ate, and the staff weren\u2019t aware of this. \n\nEventually it got to the point where they had to monitor me as I was borderline underweight. However, they never offered me chance to talk about the issues I was having in therapy and they would change the subject to my other mental health issues if I tried to talk about it. I feel as if this is a problem faced by a lot of men/boys that struggle with body image and eating. \n\nI eventually got them to listen to me and they put me on a meal plan and gave me support at meal times (which did help). However, I was never diagnosed with an eating disorder and therefore if I refused treatment there was nothing they could do. This caused me to refuse meals/support a lot and despite this they continued with my discharge plan (because my other mental health issues were no longer seen as a problem). I was underweight at this point. \n\nAfter I was discharged I struggled for a bit, and the fostering placement I was discharged to were really unsupportive and claimed I was attention-seeking and make horrible comments about my body/and invalidated my gender on purpose (I\u2019m trans). \n\nI was put back in hospital (for other reasons again) and was there for 2 months whilst they found a better placement for me. There I recovered a little bit by talking to the other patients who were really supportive and would encourage me to eat and distract me from purging afterwards. The staff still didn\u2019t intervene because it was never on my medical record and I was significantly better than in my first hospital. \n\nI got discharged to my current placement, an independent living shared house. I\u2019m doing a lot better here with continued support from the friends I made in hospital. However, some habits have started up again, excessive calorie counting, restricting, purging occasionally, having to exercise for a certain amount of time per day, restricting certain food groups not for moral reasons. I\u2019m telling myself that this is just because I want to get healthier. But every time I look in the mirror at my healthy weight body I feel disgusting and long for being underweight again. \n\nI want to talk to my therapist about this because I\u2019m scared I\u2019m heading for a relapse, but I can\u2019t relapse if I never had an ED in the first place? What should I do? Should I ignore what\u2019s going on and carry on regardless or should I try to get help? I\u2019m just scared of no one taking me seriously because now I\u2019m in the middle of the healthy weight range and there\u2019s no previous mention of an ED so I\u2019d look like an attention seeker. \n\nTLDR: can I have a relapse if I was never diagnosed with an ED in the first place and should I ask for help?", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I\u2019ve been trying to gain weight because it makes me feel really insecure to be so skinny. \n\nSo my issue isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t want to eat, I do, I want to gain weight at this stage in my recovery, but I physically can\u2019t keep anything down! It\u2019s non stop all the time, totally psychosomatic. So far I\u2019ve tried calorie protein shakes that are designed to help put on weight but I can barely finish one. I also try having lots of little snacks during the day instead of meals. Lots of fatty food too. I even try pretending (I know it\u2019s stupid but it works sometimes) that I\u2019m starving in the wilderness and this plate of toast is the first meal I\u2019ve seen in weeks and basically just try to trick myself into thinking I\u2019m hungry. \n\nAfter I eat I always have to sit still and lean back and distract myself so I don\u2019t think about the food I\u2019ve just eaten. Otherwise the nausea stays. \n\nReally what I\u2019m asking is does anyone have any little tricks to help me deal with the nausea? Any hacks that people in similar situations have found over the years? I would just love to gain some weight and keep it on. \n\nTDLR : In recovery. Want to gain weight.

Long time lurker, first time poster (with a new handle to match.)\n\nSo...wee bit of history. Was anorexic from ages 15-22, gained a stupid amount of weight (like 100+ lbs) but was pretty much in recovery from ED behaviors, decided to get weight loss surgery, lost 100+ lbs (and over 40 lbs more than they said I would) because I started engaging in ED behaviors again once I got close to \"goal weight\" because I decided I wasn't skinny enough (we all know how that goes!)\n\nSo go back into restriction + purging at least 1x/day of the small amounts I can eat + the dreaded C/S binges. (My smaller stomach can't accommodate a real binge, plus I was actually never able to make myself vomit until I had my surgery, since it's more regurgitation now.) Continue losing weight.\n\nAnyway...the C/S routine was getting hella expensive. Like I spent $150 on Cheesecake Factory delivery so I could C/S the whole thing while watching MasterChef reruns (aren't EDs fun??) So I was finally like fuck it, I'm not doing this anymore. So I stocked up on safe foods and told myself as of April 1 I would stop C/S. \n\nThen last night happens - I had an edible and of course it made me hungry AF. So I basically B/P the stuff in my kitchen (which thankfully was mostly safe-ish foods like rice cakes, skinny pop, etc.) But because of my small stomach capacity, I basically had to purge like 6 times and it was pretty gross.\n\nAnyway...feeling pretty disappointed in myself and definitely don't want to start B/P. I think the big takeaway from this is \"don't have an edible that makes you hungry\" (duh) but I'm realizing that the binging behavior, in the form of C/S or B/P, is not something that I'm going to be able to quit cold turkey.

{"post_id": "b91mfd", "created_utc": 1554315727, "title": "A Cautionary Tale for anyone considering Intermittent Fasting as a path to recovery", "author": "ObviousCurrent4", "self_text": "Obvious disclaimer that this is my own personal experience. However I think it is representative and relative to the group of redditors on this sub.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been caught up in eating disorders for about 16 years now, and with Binge Eating Disorder specifically for the past 7 or so years. During these 7 years I have followed a pattern of binging, followed by restrictive eating patterns cyclically.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have seen Intermittent Fasting (IF) put out as a potential solution/ path to overcoming Binge Eating for a while. There are also many stories on Reddit specifically about people finding great success (at least short term) with IF. I do not wish to discredit anyone's experiences, but I believe that most of these stories are coming from people who habitually overeat, but NOT those with Binge Eating Disorder. Those of you on here are likely to be all too familiar with the difference between the two.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA while ago I decided to give IF a try, because most of my binging happens at night. If I could just eat at night, I would be less likely to have a full-on binge, I reasoned. Another powerful motivator for me to try IF was that for me (and for a lot of us I imagine) one of the \"signals\" to my brain that it was time for a binge was merely the feeling of fullness. That feeling when you're to the end of a meal, comfortably full, but all of a sudden you unhinge from reality and feel the compulsion to eat more. Eat anything and everything. If I wasn't eating at all during the day, I wouldn't experience this issue. So for about a month and a half I fasted until about 5pm, and then had dinner. And I was over-the-moon. Over the course of that time I lost all of the weight I had been hanging onto, getting to my \"goal\" weight in the process. I stopped having cravings, even forgetting there were cookies in the house (an insane thing to have happen, as I'm sure many of you understand) and just generally felt amazing. Sure, I got hungry during the day, but it was nothing too terrible. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, here is where the problem lay. Where at first I was eating a hearty generous dinner, I started to think, somewhat out of the blue, that I was eating too much still. So I started weighing my food and doing a gross caloric estimate. Then a few nights later I was much more exact, calculating out my calories exactly. By the end of the week I found myself trying to eat only 600 calories a night, then lower, and.... well I am sure you can guess what happened next.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne night post small dinner, I remembered the cookies. And I had one. And then another. Then another. Then the next day I found myself compulsively eating a few spoonfuls of Almond Butter, and more, and more... And then I started full on Binging. I haven't had a prolonged binge in a while, but this was one of my worst. Almost a month solid of eating all day long, trying to get back on my IF pattern and failing miserably.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short, I believe IF is dangerous to those of us in a habitual pattern of binging and restricting. Without the process even crossing my mind, I started severely restricting. A restriction can and will happen as compulsively as a binge, and I believe by doing IF I started my mind in this process. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo those who want to try it still- beware of these patterns. For many of us who are deep within the binge-restrict cycle, a prolonged period of restriction will only kick off a prolonged binge, as happened to me. While I applaud those of you who find success with IF, I just wanted to share my story since it appears to be gaining in popularity and touted as a great solution to binge eating. As I mentioned previously, I believe it could be helpful for those who are not habituated to binging and restricting, but dangerous to those who fall into that category.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I didn't eat for a bit over 36 hours before lunch today. I ate dinner too, but felt totally guilty after doing so, and almost thought I was going to throw up (thankfully I'm emetophobic so I don't think bulimia is going to catch up yet...).   \nI've lost roughly 8kg in the past month-ish... I really want to look underweight. I can't get that body shape out of the front of my mind.

I am 23 and 4\u201d11. I have always had discomfort with my body, because I am a lot curvier than a lot of my family. My older sister used to call me a fat pig and some of the neighborhood kids would make fun of me etc.  This along with some family issues led me to develop bulimia with purging through exercise and vomiting.  I still struggled in college but tbh I haven\u2019t excessively purged or exercised in six months and my ED has gotten a lot better since graduating. However, I still feel very uncomfortable in my body, like how tight my jeans are around my thighs and like my stomach poking out. Many people say I look very fit, but it\u2019s hard for me to see it.  I\u2019m about 117 right now and wanted to get down to my high school weight of 110. \n\nWhile I do still want to lose weight, I\u2019m also just so sick of this being an issue. I know that my health is fine and that I am fit.  I am sad knowing that I have wasted so much of my life worrying about weight and calories when I could have been doing life fulfilling things like learning Spanish, planning trips, reading\u2014just anything else really. \n\nSo, instead of waiting to lose the \u201clast seven pounds\u201d (which is never enough as I know first hand), I want to really try and move on from this issue. I have been listening to a lot of health at every size podcasts, like Food Psyche by Christie Harrison.  It\u2019s been really helpful to hear her interview people who have gone on the same journey. I also recently started listening to the book \u201cThe Fuck It Diet\u201d. For those who don\u2019t know, it\u2019s basically a book on how to stop dieting and living life and enjoying food and accepting your body. \n\nSo far I like it.  As I dive more into intuitive eating and letting go of disordered eating/dieting, I do find that i think about food less and am less stressed out in general about it.  For example, i had a large bowl of pasta yesterday, which I haven\u2019t done in years. And today I had a burrito (which has given me some anxiety) but with the actual eating part I am doing okay. \n\nThe one thing I am having trouble though is accepting my body size and type.  It\u2019s hard for me to not feel like I am huge and just feel super uncomfortable in my body. I don\u2019t like how my thighs touch and like how my stomach pokes out somewhat.  It\u2019s kind of like a constant low to mid level source of anxiety that compiles everyday. \n\nI guess I was just wondering if anyone else is having this kind of problem? It\u2019s just also kinda distressing cuz I\u2019m not restricting and over exercising anymore to compensate, so I feel bloated and that adds to my physical/mental discomfort.  I am wondering if anyone has had this kind of discomfort and has gotten over it, how did you do so?\n\nThanks, sorry the post is so long.

Nope. I\u2019m super good at this being fucked up thing. I mean I had my first panic attack at age three, so it\u2019s been quite a few years on this train wreck. Well, I shouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve never had stable mental health for 48 hours. I had about half of sixth grade where I was mostly okay. Most of my childhood anxiety had subsided and the eating disorder was just getting started but wasn\u2019t too bad yet. The funny thing is, I always knew it would end in a giant wreck from the time I was really little. I remember feeling so lonely and misunderstood because I didn\u2019t know what was wrong with me, but somehow I knew that one day, I\u2019d hit my breaking point. Well, I\u2019ve hit it over and over again. Most people would pin those breaking points on the five times I\u2019ve been hospitalized for my eating disorder and self-harm. And yeah, those were lows in my life, but the hardest things I\u2019ve gone through, no one has seen. I remember being in elementary school and sobbing because I thought I\u2019d have to kill myself before I reached adulthood out of the sheer misery I was in. I remember the hours and hours I spent in the bathroom getting sick as a child because I was so anxious. I remember my first attempt at self-harm; I was seven. I remember brushing my teeth with my brother\u2019s toothbrush when he had strep throat so that I would get sick too and get out of a situation that was scaring me so much I couldn\u2019t sleep; points for creativity? \n\nBut, people didn\u2019t see any of that. I didn\u2019t even talk about it until a couple years ago. Most people say my life was the most difficult between my eighth grade year and my freshman year of college. And, yeah, it was really hard then, but the only reason other people say that is because my illness was visible then. I went from being a really skinny kid to a skeletal one, I accumulated some scars on my arms and legs, I started sleeping all the time, I began isolating, and I didn\u2019t care about anything anymore. It was a really difficult time, but so was the time before that. Since I wasn\u2019t actively hurting myself or making my body sick until then, no one thought it was worth addressing. Had it been addressed in the many years before my very visible unraveling, maybe the unraveling wouldn\u2019t have been so severe. Our society has a problem of waiting to address mental health problems until they have such detrimental effects that it is hard to come back from them. There is some focus placed on teen mental health, although there could definitely be more. But, I think the area that needs the most improvement is children's\u2019 mental health. So many issues arise from our childhood, it shapes us into who we are for better or worse. It is always assumed that kids are fine, that they\u2019re happy and carefree. But, what if they\u2019re not and they don\u2019t have the capacity to express that yet?

I am 23 and 4\u201d11. I have always had discomfort with my body, because I am a lot curvier than a lot of my family. My older sister used to call me a fat pig and some of the neighborhood kids would make fun of me etc.  This along with some family issues led me to develop bulimia with purging through exercise and vomiting.  I still struggled in college but tbh I haven\u2019t excessively purged or exercised in six months and my ED has gotten a lot better since graduating. However, I still feel very uncomfortable in my body, like how tight my jeans are around my thighs and like my stomach poking out. Many people say I look very fit, but it\u2019s hard for me to see it.  I\u2019m about 117 right now and wanted to get down to my high school weight of 110. \n\nWhile I do still want to lose weight, I\u2019m also just so sick of this being an issue. I know that my health is fine and that I am fit.  I am sad knowing that I have wasted so much of my life worrying about weight and calories when I could have been doing life fulfilling things like learning Spanish, planning trips, reading\u2014just anything else really. \n\nSo, instead of waiting to lose the \u201clast seven pounds\u201d (which is never enough as I know first hand), I want to really try and move on from this issue. I have been listening to a lot of health at every size podcasts, like Food Psyche by Christie Harrison.  It\u2019s been really helpful to hear her interview people who have gone on the same journey. I also recently started listening to the book \u201cThe Fuck It Diet\u201d. For those who don\u2019t know, it\u2019s basically a book on how to stop dieting and living life and enjoying food and accepting your body. \n\nSo far I like it.  As I dive more into intuitive eating and letting go of disordered eating/dieting, I do find that i think about food less and am less stressed out in general about it.  For example, i had a large bowl of pasta yesterday, which I haven\u2019t done in years. And today I had a burrito (which has given me some anxiety) but with the actual eating part I am doing okay. \n\nThe one thing I am having trouble though is accepting my body size and type.  It\u2019s hard for me to not feel like I am huge and just feel super uncomfortable in my body. I don\u2019t like how my thighs touch and like how my stomach pokes out somewhat.  It\u2019s kind of like a constant low to mid level source of anxiety that compiles everyday. \n\nI guess I was just wondering if anyone else is having this kind of problem? It\u2019s just also kinda distressing cuz I\u2019m not restricting and over exercising anymore to compensate, so I feel bloated and that adds to my physical/mental discomfort.  I am wondering if anyone has had this kind of discomfort and has gotten over it, how did you do so?\n\nThanks, sorry the post is so long. I don\u2019t have anyone to talk about this with irl (i go to therapy for ocd but that\u2019s not a place I talk about my ed with)", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I did all the things I never imagined I would've done. Sparing you the details, but I was not me at all.\n\nWhat sucks is that I know all it took was a mental switch.

She doesn't see it as a big deal, and I don't think she wants to do anything to change the behaviors right now, even though it's starting to affect her health. I've offered to go with her to talk to her GP, or to take her to the specialized group therapy the university we attend offers. I've told her about lots of resources, but she sort of nods and says \"Maybe.\" She's struggled with suicide attempts, cutting, and now binging and purging, but doesn't want professional help. Instead, she wants me to come over all the time when she feels anxious because having someone there is \"the only thing that fixes it.\" We go out to eat a lot because she says she doesn't purge after restaurants. It's a lot of pressure when she makes me feel like I'm the only one keeping her from these dangerous habits. All of this would be hard for any partner, but I'm a recovering anorexic, something I talked about struggling with early on in our relationship--before she started purging. Although I'm technically in a healthy weight range, I'm on the heavier side of that and am really struggling with my body image right now. I can't tell her about it, though, because she says she tends to pick up other people's coping mechanisms. The pressure has made me feel out of control and is sending me spiraling--binging and restricting. She's moving away in August after graduation, and I think she wants to continue a relationship long distance but I'm not sure I can, so this is relatively short term. In the meantime, though, what is the best way to support and love someone who doesn't want to get better while also keeping yourself healthy?", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

She definitely doesn't have an ED but I think she wants to lose weight, so there are days where she'll eat pretty little (e.g. saving half of a normal sized salad that she got for lunch to eat for dinner), and it's super triggering when I see her sometimes skips meals or doesn't eat. She also sleeps a LOT (like more than me at night and then like every time I come back to the room in the afternoon she's just napping like wtf) and that just reminds me of how more sleeping time means less eating time lmao. Or she'll comment about how she's cold or dizzy or hungry (but then doesn't eat), or how she's so full after eating, or how she eats too much. Idk these things all remind me of coping mechanisms that I use or have heard of while restricting.

You might ask, is it possible for someone to enjoy a restaurant so much that they eat there 426 times? Well, you haven\u2019t tried the Pine Cone Caf\u00e9 and experienced its extraordinary ambiance. It is a place that keeps you coming back for more. The food is exquisite and the staff are there to meet your every need. It\u2019s so fancy that the meals are served covered dish and everyone\u2019s dish is slightly different to meet their particular palate. \n\nAt least, that\u2019s what I tell people. In truth, the Pine Cone Caf\u00e9 is the room where we have to eat. The food is mediocre, and it\u2019s super awkward in there because some grown-ass person is usually crying. It\u2019s kind of dismal. It\u2019s the room where people face their toughest demons, which might sound like an exaggeration, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a difficult place. So, what do you do when there\u2019s something mildly traumatizing in your life that makes you question your existence? You put it on the internet. That\u2019s kind of the point of the whole internet thing. I wrote a Yelp review to add to those made by my predecessors for the Pine Cone Caf\u00e9 so that people show up at the eating disorder nuthouse thinking it\u2019s an actual restaurant. I made a menu as well that is also on Yelp. And, it\u2019s great, random people show up and try to eat at the Pine Cone Caf\u00e9. They ignore the sign out front and the lettering on the building that clearly say it\u2019s eating disorder rehab and march right in, trying to find the restaurant. The lady at the front desk has to turn them away and say that there isn\u2019t actually a restaurant open to the public. At that point, people get very confused. Two businessmen came in their suits and ties to dine with us, and were genuinely disappointed when they learned they couldn\u2019t eat there. But, not my problem. I just write the reviews. I was actually quite honest in my review from several weeks back, I just inflated a few of the perks of the Caf\u00e9: \n\n*Wow. What a unique dining experience. I have eaten here 6 times per day for the past 5 weeks; it's just that compulsory. The menu here is different every day, but repeats itself every 3 weeks to allow for a perfect balance of variety and familiarity. As for the food, it is the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me. Options vary from the world famous Asian-inspired soba noodle salad to Colorado's finest carrot ginger soup. For the less adventurous eater, the Pine Cone Caf\u00e9 offers grilled cheese with cheese made from the tears of past customers and panko-encrusted chicken tenders with a sweet and savory honey mustard sauce. However, you can only order each of these delicacies once every 3 weeks. But, not to worry, if you don't enjoy the explosive flavors, the staff will offer you a liquid replacement for your food that comes in strawberry, chocolate, or vanilla. The magic liquid is stored in a special wine cellar in mahogany boxes. They will provide you with encouragement until you complete it. In fact, they are so insistent that you get adequate nutrition that you have to fill out an official form should you not complete the liquid food.* \n\n*While the food is incredible, what really sets this place apart is its distinct culture. The intimate caf\u00e9 usually seats just 4 tables of 6. The waitstaff sit with you whilst you dine and encourage games to be played at the table. If you choose to immerse yourself in this sensory experience, be aware that it is considered rude here at the Pine Cone Caf\u00e9 to put your napkin in your lap. Should you make the grave mistake of putting your napkin in your lap, or even worse, putting your hands below the table, you shall receive a stern glare from a staff member and, in the most extreme cases, chastising from fellow diners.* \n\n*Don't worry, your dining experience doesn't end with the meal. The party continues into the night! Following dinner, you are invited to the resort's second floor which boasts private state rooms and a spa. The spa specializes in the ancient art of Japanese urinary analysis. Spa attendants analyze a silver cup of your urine each day to ensure adequate hydration. Should your urine not pass the test, you will be given a special ruby-encrusted goblet full of water at the next meal.* \n\n*Overall, I give this place an 11/10 which is why I have no intention of leaving anytime soon and even brought many of my favorite things from home to keep in my private state room.*\n\nSo, now, for the rest of my life, whenever I see a pine cone, I\u2019m going to have the weirdest flashbacks. I\u2019ll be 35 years old and making one of those pine cone bird feeders with my kid, and all I\u2019ll be able to think about is someone dropping a single blueberry at snack and getting it replaced. You drop one little blueberry and have to get a new one because we don\u2019t restrict at the Pine Cone Caf\u00e9. Or, I\u2019ll be walking down the street and step on a pine cone and the crunch will bring me right back to the millions of bags of pita chips I had to eat in the caf\u00e9.

Other people being overweight is often mentioned in a negative tone if she's talking about a bad experience at work for example, although she avoids doing it when my little sister is around.\n\nMaybe it has something to do with both of us being self-conscious and worrying about what others think more than people usually do.

But dude FUCK treatment and therapy. Things had already been kinda tense there with my team due to them constantly giving me ultimatums to either eat more or be dropped down to OP (never understood why they suggested this over stepping up but whatever they hardly make sense at all ever). \n\nThree weeks ago, after a successful two weeks, I was surprisingly given a new, unrelated ultimatum to get admitted to substance abuse treatment or be forced to leave the program altogether. This was absolute bullshit; I am an adult, living in a state where marijuana use is legal, and smoking pretty small amounts to help sleep. I tried to fight it, and my therapist even promised to \"go to bat\" for me, but the same answer stood.\n\nOn top of all that mess, a person in the program outed themself as a rapist. This alone is mindbogglingly triggering and caused immense distress. But the response from staff (or lack thereof, really) was SO pathetically and horrifyingly awful. Staff and founders firmly stood by so many disgusting statements, such as: \"Don't get mad at us, we're people, too\", \"people who abuse others deserve the same care as people who were abused\", \"this is a beneficial life lesson in how to handle conflict\", \"it's not like it happened recently or on property\", \"this is not a dangerous situation at all\", and \"well staff got you a wrap and ice so it's not a big deal\" (that last one was specifically spoken to me in response to me saying \"I literally self-harmed in this group because I'm fucking terrified to be in the room with them\" when staff said the thing about the situation not being that bad or dangerous). There were THREE process groups about this shit, and nothing was done expect staff showing support and sympathy to this person, and even a couple clients showing support and love as well as telling staff their decision to keep that person \"was so cool\".\n\nEverything just came crashing down so fast in just two weeks. My last team meeting last week is when I finally told them that \"so long as a rapist is in the building, I will not come here and support this business\". To me, this shit is just wildly inappropriate and irresponsible. Trained professionals in the therapy field should not act like this; they should know that EDs stem from trauma, so many people in program have been assaulted and raped, and that knowingly putting a rapist in a room with rape survivors is detrimental to everyone's recovery. They have the power to refer this person out, but they choose to take pity on them instead. In a workplace environment, this would get someone fired. Just absolutely unbelievable. \n\nI'm so pessimistic about treatment now. It just feels like such bullshit to know a center can so blatantly go against its own values of creating a therapeutic space. Knowing a rapist could be in the same program as me again makes my skin crawl and blood boil. This also makes me feel so pissed about my own rapes, and just reminds me how easy it is for rapists to get away with abhorrent behavior and even be praised by others while they invalidate the victim's pain. Please don't let my negative experience in HLC deter yourself from seeking it out, but I will say that it's smart to prepare yourself for potential danger, even in program. Rapists are everywhere, even in eating disorder treatment centers, and not all of them will do what this person did and out themselves. Please keep yourselves safe, you deserve safety. \n\nEDIT: A lil spelling error ", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

Every time I eat, I feel like I emerge hungrier (or at least with more desire to eat) than before.\n\nThis is bugging me since *nothing else changed in my routine*. I was already eating at around or above maintenance for *months* before this happened, and it was so sudden, so I'm not sure what could be causing it :/ I think someone suggested to me that my body could be \"rebelling\" since I'm underweight (TW: exact stats in the spoiler tag, which I include in case it's relevant&gt;!5', 74 lbs!&lt;) but I'm not sure if that happens?\n\nIt's also sort of baffling me since I've never struggled with binge eating? Fortunately I haven't been eating more than usual despite the hunger/appetite change, so I'm not exactly worried about gaining, just worried about physical feeling.\n\nTbh I actually have suicidal urges because of this. I feel like I'm dreading eating since it doesn't satisfy me at all and makes me hungrier. Before this I looked forward to eating my planned/measured food every day and now I feel like a huge source of happiness has just been gone. I feel really silly writing that this leads me to suicidal urges but it makes me feel like there's no point to live anymore.\n\nI'm really scared this just will become permanent, that eating will always make me hungrier and that nothing would ever really satisfy me.\n\nUmm, any thoughts/advice?", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I have favourite spoons and will refuse to eat with any other cutlery.\n\nI have to have plenty of water, I will eat a few tiny spoonfuls of food, swig of water, rinse and repeat. My poor fianc\u00e9 often has to get me a few more pint refills during a meal.\n\nI eat as slowly as I possibly can. It takes me around an hour or more to finish a microwave meal, about half an hour to finish a yogurt etc. This means my food is always stone cold about half way through. \n\nI always need to go to the toilet before a meal just on the off chance I might feel the need to go during eating, I don\u2019t want my meals times to be disturbed.\n\nI will not talk to anyone whilst eating or be able to pay attention to anything, all my focus is on my food.\n\nThe light has to be on whilst I eat, I want to be able to see my food. \n\nMy food has to be absolutely perfect. If my food isn\u2019t what I think of as perfect I get very stressed and angry, often on the verge of tears. \n\nIf my food requires mixing (curries with rice, salads with dressing etc) I will mix it for a good 5 minutes before beginning to eat. \n\nI keep food in my mouth for as long as possible, I chew it to the point of disintegration. I\u2019m pretty sure my food probably disappears before I swallow it hahaha. \n\nI have to scrape off every last bit of food. If I have to lick the plate, I will. I pick up tiny crumbs from pizzas. \n\nI constantly clear my nose even though I know full well it isn\u2019t blocked at all, it stresses me out thinking I might not be getting the full taste of my food. \n\nI eat bits of food separately that are intended to be eaten together. In a salad I will eat the leaves, then the onions, then the peppers, then the chicken and corn. If I have a burger I eat little bits of the patty and bread separately. \n\nFinally, I have to eat as late as I possibly can. This is a relatively new one and I\u2019m not sure why. \n\nI\u2019m sure there are others I\u2019m forgetting, if I remember more I will edit them in hahaha, I feel like a freak and often feel my family look at me strangely so I thought I would share this with people who might relate with me. \n", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I'll also comment the parts I like and disliked because I don't have enough room. A few spoilers, but it's been out since 2015 so idc.\n\nThe opening theme to the show is pretty interesting and I think a lot of us could relate to it..it's an animated fat girl climbing up an impossibly tall mountain that's made of sweets and junk food. She's climbing up tirelessly, and starts getting thinner and thinner. When she's halfway up, men start following her now that she's thin, but she's not at the top yet. She's getting closer and closer to the summit, and her hair falls out and her face becomes gaunt. She collapses right before she reaches the summit, never having finally reached it. It pans out to show her, almost zombie-like, almost \"winning\" the game of thinness but not quite. The message is clear: there are no winners in having an ED. \nIt reminded me of a lot of Ana's here who talk about it never being thin enough. \n\n\n\nTl;dr: I liked the show for promoting body positivity and not waiting to live life until you're at your GW. I didn't like how there wasn't any mention of health besides intuitive eating (no gaining strength or nutrients, just telling a BED sufferer permission to binge on cupcakes and hamburgers). \n\nIf you read it or watched the show, let me know what you thought :)", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

My whole life has basically been having weight loss in the back of my mind; I\u2019m right now the heaviest I\u2019ve ever been, which for my height is normal weight on the very brink of overweight, at least BMI-wise. Starting in August, I tried to go on a relatively calorie-restricted diet, and while I thought it was going okay I always felt guilty for going over the calorie numbers (and ended up not losing any weight for months).\n\nA few months ago, something just snapped in my brain and I couldn\u2019t handle the restriction anymore. This triggered a descent into what I\u2019d probably term bulimia if it had been going on longer: binges/purges occurring anywhere from once every few days to several times a day. I can\u2019t focus on school, I can\u2019t function in normal spaces, the thought of being around food gives me anxiety even though I love cooking/groceries/feeding people.\n\nMy college\u2019s counseling is notoriously terrible, and a wonderful doctor at a nearby college has been talking to me about her intuitive eating self-help book for free. I can\u2019t thank her enough, she took the time to go over all the principles with me and answers my questions. I\u2019m so embarrassed to go back and see her because I\u2019ve failed so hard in the two weeks since I was supposed to start trying not restricting/bingeing/purging. I don\u2019t know wtf my hunger and fullness signals are and at this point it\u2019s too late to ask. The whole \u201ctake away restriction\u201d thing has been so nice in the sense of I haven\u2019t had to wake up most mornings telling myself it\u2019s a fasting day and then failing (which is really depressing and hard), but I know I\u2019ve gained a few pounds over these weeks and honestly my anxiety over that is insane - I\u2019ve tried hiding my scale, but not knowing stresses me, and sometimes i\u2019ve even woken up from the anxiety several times throughout the night to weigh myself. It doesn\u2019t help that summer\u2019s upon us, and while i somehow have a bathing suit I like, I\u2019m terrified of getting too big for my clothes and shopping for new styles I like is just a really depressing experience.\n\nI\u2019m graduating soon, traveling, and then living at home and then abroad, so it\u2019s stressful knowing I\u2019ll never actually talk to someone long-term about this.

Obviously, being a minor, I got my ass sent straight through the Maudsley treatment, and to give them credit, it worked. I was sneaky and afraid and scared, and that was honestly the only way for me to get myself out of that situation. However, I did get better, it has worked for me and now I'm at my goal weight. \n\nThats the thing. I'm doing amazingly, I've gotten better at trying to eat intuitively, when I'm hungry, only when I'm hungry. I don't feel trapped by the disorder anymore. It's liberating, I feel like I aged so much more than I did just trying to survive in the state I was in.

I never thought I would be elated by the knowledge that I am currently bleeding out of my lady bits, but eating disorders leave us in strange places right?\n\nHowever, my parents have decided that I am 'reverting to my old ways'. Usually I'm not hungry at dinner time, because I snack all afternoon, so I'm restricting. I didn't bother to leave obviously dirty plates when I ate a meal without them yesterday, so I must have been lying and didn't eat it. I know it comes from a place of love, but every time I do something to try and leave this disorder behind, they think I'm taking a step backwards, and treat me accordingly. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm going to tell my therapist about my cycle coming back, but I can't bring myself to tell my parents yet. It feels so cruel that I've worked so hard and come so far but to them, I'm still being an uncooperative, disordered brat. I wanted to celebrate, but now I'm just resigned. The less I focus on my eating habits, the more my parents fixate on them. I can't pretend I didn't get satisfaction from being as skinny as I was, but I can say with vigor I will never go back. I want to be able to run and jump and be comfortable and strong in my body. To anyone who's struggling, I can't speak for everyone, but for me, recovery was worth every ounce of fear and struggle.\n\nI'm sorry this was pretty long and not directly about eating disorders, but I really needed to get this out to someone. I hope you guys could at least understand the frustration of not being trusted. I know its all coming from a good place, but they're starting to hurt rather than help, and I'm stuck. I'll be ok, but I was hurt by some of the stuff they said and just needed to get it all out. I have some good mates, who haven't really been involved with my illness but who support me, so I'm ok. I'm aware there's not much I can do until I move out in a year or so, but I just needed a quick rant.\n\nHope you have a good week and overcome something scary &lt;3, I've always been a lurker but hearing the frank truth from you all has given me the strength to keep going too.

I was thirteen and had no concept of my weight or my body-image. It was only about control. It started with not eating the bread at school lunch, then the side dishes, then the entree, until I was only drinking the small carton of milk each day. The attention and concern from teachers only reinforced my restriction because at least someone was finally caring about my needs. I'd come home from school, giddy with starvation, and compulsively do my crunches or re-tally my calories. The routine and order was comforting to my anxious mind. It was never even about weight, only the control I had over this one aspect of my life.  \n\n\nWhen she died, I lost myself. How could a girl go through her most stressful years without her mother? Now it was finally about the weight. Restriction was my slow suicide. The compulsion of calculating my daily calorie intake became as routine as breathing. My brain was overflowing with numbers. I'd step on the scale to see if I had won or lost the day, with every pound lost, a wave of excitement washed over me. Another victorious day. 10 pounds lost, 20 pounds lost, 30 pounds lost. No matter how low the number, I was always displeased with the reflection in the mirror. The breaking hair, purple nails, lack of a menstrual cycle, and protruding hip bones were all encouragers to keep going, until there was nothing left of me. The challenge of seeing how low my pulse could get was just another reminder of my desire to disappear. What was the point of recovery if I just wanted to die?  \n\n\nEventually, anorexia became bulimia which then became orthorexia. I could binge to the point of pain and cleanse my body within seconds. I could exercise for hours, knowing my calories were slowly melting away. My eating disorder shifted and contorted to appear as recovery over the years.

It's familiar, reliable, and comforting. But the easy choice is most often not the right choice. I have to recover. I have to live. If not for me, then for my future self. My future children.

I don't quite know what's up with this, i feel like there are not that many posts of people further along the road from recovery, still struggling with a a now new set of challenges and difficulties. I  remember being at the midst of my first full blown anorexia/bulimia episodes (they were two separate moments of my life), and going on frantically looking for answers due to how much anxiety everything gave me. However as time went on, i already knew everything there was to know. i feel like I've gone through every type of recovery there is to be done. i'm 20 now and my eating disorder started to become a big problem when i was 14 (although it was there before).\n\nI've done Minnie Maud, I've had a nutritionist carefully guide my every step, I've been an inpatient and an outpatient, i tried replacing my disordered behaviors with other activities, the list goes on. I came to a point that last time i was in the hospital just simply complied with all of their rules and i was out in a month. I've learned to eat without really caring much, i don't carefully weigh anything, i can pass months on end without counting any of my food. Yet for some reason the voice is still there lingering in a much quieter way. i Know that as a so called \"recovered\" person, i should be setting an example, or at least i feel i should show only the best parts of being recovered, because i don't want anyone to think its not worth it. it is, it soooo is. However, it's a long and hard journey that doesn't end when the doctor thinks you no longer need their assistance, or when the psychiatrist takes you off the meds.\n\nthe most painful part of me is over now, but i'm now facing the more lonely part. where i no longer feel i can openly talk about my weekly struggles without feeling like i'm being a nuisance for not just \"being over it\". i don't like always thinking on the same fears, especially not when i know the answer to them, but i still do. no i will not lose my worth if i gain 5 more kilos, at one moment i want to gain those 5 kilos, it' fill up my skin and make me \"thicc\", but then when i do get there i want to go back down and  i want to be slim, so when i lose those 5 kilos again i don't like it because if feel like i have no shape and my extra skin is too noticeable. i keep gaining and losing the same 5 kilos over and over again. i start going to the gym and i lift weights because that's all the rage these days. that's how you get those insta curves (my brain doesn't even take into account everyone in there is fully facetuned, even tho i know exactly how fake they are i still want to look like them)\n\ni can track my calories on an app and not think much about it, i do it without obsessing about it, but  then start noticing that i don't eat enough, it's actually quite hard for me to eat enough. i'm at a normal weight but i know it's not enough. The food i have at home is so boring tho, and i have no patience to cook, i stopped cooking out of fear and frustration. I have arbitrary rules in my head on what's acceptable and what isn't. i still have periodic moments when i have disordered behaviors, for like a week or so and then i get them under control... But's it's not a relapse right.... i'm not like  was before, wishing i was nothing but skin and bone, idolizing the shape of a corpse. At least now i WANT to gain weight, and i  WANT to have a body that in the eyes of the mainstream is \"healthy\".\n\nwell 1. it's not. and 2. what if im suffering anyway because of it. maybe all i want is to fee like my ass is good enough for my boyfriend to look at, even tho he tells me every day that he loves my body just the way that it is. i don't feel perfect. i am still looking for perfect. i already know it doesn't exist and i should just enjoy life as it is and i have days when i don't give a damn and that's what i do. But then i have almost as many moments when i don't feel that way, when i don't know what my body looks like, when i don't know what i want my body to look like, when i doubt my every step and i don't know if there ever will be an end to it.\n\ncuz that's all i want. i just want it gone, and i refuse to believe that it won't be gone one day. i haven't gone this far for nothing. to not be able to genuinely not give a sh\\*t what i look like.\n\nTL;DL : i'm basically recovered, aside for a small behavior here and there, but i feel like everyone expects me to be fine and over my disorder, when in reality it is still here in one way or another and i still doubt myself and struggle with little things that then contribute to my frustration. but  don't feel like i can talk about it with anyone i know", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

It's evident now that I'm turning to food as a type of numbing agent- sort of how weed actually makes me feel too.\n\nIs this something I can work towards myself or do I need to get professional help? I feel like people won't take me seriously (mainly my family) if I go to the and say I have an eating disorders mainly because I am a male and it's not prevalent around us.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

We have been close for over 8 years. She's always been a bit thinner than her identical twin, but now her twin weighs is at a healthy weight and she is significantly underweight.\n\nI don't know how to support her because she lives 400 miles away from me. This week we were both in our hometown and I got to see her twice. She said that she was good, talks about how she's excited to go see her nutritionist/ED specialist...but it's all lies. She purged last night when I was hanging out with her after eating two bites of pizza (although she doesn't know we know that). She's getting to a really scary place and I'm concerned that she isn't seeing professionals with the frequency needed to improve, is lying to the professionals, doesn't actually have any interest in getting better, and/or is lying about going to the professional appointments at all.\n\nIt all feels really hopeless and we just want to see her improve.\n\nMore Info...\n\nShe was first diagnosed with an eating disorder in May of last year, but she didn't tell any of us about it until 4 months ago. Apparently in May she weighed significantly less than her twin. She was making some progress and got up to a bit less with nutritional shakes and seeing a nutritionist, but she has regressed significantly (past the original underweight).\n\nHer mother (who she has an estranged relationship with) also had an eating disorder. Her twin suspects that she talks to their mom on the phone more than she admits and that their mother is actually giving her strategies for weight loss.\n\nShe has been diagnosed as bipolar and is being watched under suspicion of schizophrenia as well. She claims to be taking her bipolar medication.\n\nHer mother is bipolar, but also a terrible person. She sees herself as a reflection of her mom in some ways. There is this element of self-fulfilling prophecy where she subconsciously may think she is doomed to be just like her mother, who she resents.\n\nHer twin lives 400 miles away as well. Our other friend (we were kind of a foursome in high school) lives 20 minutes away and also wants to support her.\n\nHer father does not understand the severity of the issue and has made comments like \"just eat something\". He is willing to help finance treatments in small ways, but I don't think he has an interest in paying a lot. She isn't in a personal financial situation to pay for long term treatment. Both her twin and our other friend's mom (a mental health professional) have tried to talk to him about the situation, but he has not been receptive.\n\nShe has a lot of relationship and academic problems that are big stressors in her life, but they are too complex to explain here fully (e.g. she lives with her ex girlfriend and has been in undergrad for 4 years with 5 years remaining).\n\nShe openly admits to eating about 2 pieces of toast a day, no longer having hunger pains, purging the toast, using appetite suppressants, and laxatives. But she will tell you this in such an apathetic and nonchalant way. It's really chilling.\n\nShe over exercises despite the orders of her ED specialist.\n\nTL;DR: How do I support a friend with an eating disorder when I live 400 miles away?\n\nUpdate Since I Originally Wrote This:\n\nShe has been hospitalized because her small intestine collapsed. Hopefully this will be a wakeup call for her father, but perhaps not.\n\nI have been watching a lot of videos from a girl on YouTube named Rebecca. They have really helped me to understand the kind of internal turmoil that is actually associated with these disorders. I want to share the videos with my friend (they are primarily about recovery, but she is honest on the days that she struggles), but am concerned that it will trigger her further or something. Let me know what you think about sharing some recovery content with her.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

As much as I love Canada's free health care, my city has only two ED treatment programs based around group therapy and they both have very long wait lists (about 6-12 months). \n\nMy friends and family all know about my disorder, as I have been fairly open about it since I relapsed a year and a half ago. They have expressed that if I ever need support, not to hesitate in contacting them, even if it is just to call someone while I eat dinner to make sure it happens. I am incredibly grateful for this, but I simultaneously do not want to burden the people I love with the constant anorexic thoughts. I'm sick and tired of these thoughts, so I can only imagine how annoying it might get for someone who doesn't even understand what it is like to live with this. \n\nThis fear of burdening people has also been combined with the fact that I feel like asking for help, or celebrating little victories (like eating a normal portion of dessert) is asking for attention, especially because I don't necessarily present as \"sick\". I can act normal around food with my friends (like, I can drink a beer, or eat some chips, etc. like they do, and one of my friends who doesn't know and I are always talking about restaurants we want to try) and because I can do that, I feel like a fraud when I ask for help. Even though I know it isn't normal to plan your whole day's intake around one beer. But they don't see that, they just see me drinking one like everyone else. I feel like I have to prove to them that I am sick in order to deserve talking about recovery, and asking for help with it. Which in a way ties in with feeling like I need to get sicker to recover. \n\nI guess what I am trying to say is: I feel really alone in recovery. And I wish I had a few people to talk to that understood all the little intricacies and mindgames of an ED. People who understand the little victories and want to celebrate their own, too.

Before I moved down south I was 98 pounds. I wouldn't eat for days at a time. I'd keep cocaine and cigarettes around to curb my appetite. I'd reward myself for not eating if I chose to drink alcohol as those could be my calories. I was obsessed with going to the gym. My heart was broken and I honestly believed if I could just be a little thinner I'd be pretty enough to win back the guy who broke my heart. I was a musician (not especially successful or anything but locally known) and there was a lot of emphasis I placed on looking a certain way. I ended up leaving that whole scene and moving across the country because deep down I knew I was unhealthy and that a complete change of scenery was called for. I couldn't get better in that place with those people around me.\n\nAfter I relocated I made a conscious effort to stop counting my calories. I still went to the gym but only a few times a week. I ate lots of delicious foods. I gained 20 pounds in a year. So I was about 120 lbs. At that point I thought I should probably start to \"diet\" again, but my concept of dieting is so extreme it's all or nothing. I don't know why but it's like I can't be normal with food. It's not possible for me to pay a healthy amount of attention to what I'm eating without wanting to maximize weight loss results to an unhealthy degree. At any rate at about 120 lbs I became pregnant.. so I just gave up the concept of a diet altogether. I'm now 128 lbs entering my 3rd month of pregnancy.. and I already feel huge. I feel worse too because my sister is 128 lbs and shes 7 months pregnant! I'm horrified that I'm fat right now and only getting bigger but I 100% know I can't diet right now. I'm doing my best to eat healthy. My boyfriend says I look great, but I seriously feel like a blimp. I've gained 8 lbs in 2 months and I just feel awful.\n\nI tend to have cycles where I'm super skinny or slightly overweight. I'm short so 130 lbs is considered overweight for my height. I'm only just realizing that I have an unhealthy approach to thinking about food and that I have body issues and possibly body dysmorphia. I don't know what I can do about it as I don't think it's possible for me to see someone who's not fat in the mirror.  Even at 98 lbs I felt fat and would've pushed myself harder .. but something clicked about my life and I decided I needed to go in the opposite direction. \n\nThis is a long rambling post that probably has no point. I'd just like to thank anyone who has read this and if anyone has any advice how to not obsess about how fat they look I'd really appreciate it. I know being pregnant I'm only going to get fatter.. and I'm terrified I'm gaining too much weight because I'm not able to keep a food diary without going to an extreme. I want to be healthy for my baby. I fear eventually relapsing after my pregnancy is over because how fat I will become will motivate me to be skinnier than ever. I don't want to fall into that trap but realistically I'm going to have to diet and I'm just scared of losing control again. \n\nRant over.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I break out into a rash across my face and random hives but I can never pinpoint it to one food - and I've convinced myself that it must be something I'm eating and if I can only figure out the right combination of good foods vs. bad foods, my skin will clear up and I'll feel better.\n\nI obsess constantly about the foods I'm eating and check my mirror before and after I eat to see if I get a reaction.

I started to recover properly last March, after a lot of hospital visits and a really strong jealousy of other people my age and their lives. In June, I met my boyfriend, and he kept me going in a way no one else has before. He got me to eat pizza hut for the first time in years, and to get takeaways, and made me feel really good about my body. I maintained a weight on the lower side of healthy as I would still have plenty bad days and tried to count my calories a lot, but he helped me challenge fears I'd never been bothered to challenge in past recovery attempts. I started my first full-time job, we moved in together, and my life finally started seeming normal.\n\nI had to move out a few months ago: I quit my job, couldn't find a new one, we were struggling financially and I missed my friends and family. Since I moved back in with my mum, things have been going really poorly. This is the house and environment my ED thrives in. I have a new job I'm starting this week, I'm looking into apprenticeships and learning to drive, but all I can think about is how much weight I can lose now my mum thinks I'm fine again and isn't as watchful. My boyfriend visited this weekend after 6 weeks apart (we're long-distance), and told me I was noticeably smaller and he was really concerned. I'm tired of throwing my life away on this bullshit, but every time I panic about being an adult and living a real life I fall back into this safety net where things at least make sense. I hate it so much. I bought some really nice clothes this year and all of them just hang off me now, but my old clothes from before I recovered are way too small still, and it's a battle of trying to push myself to be healthier versus wanting to desperately fit into clothes I bought as a teenager that I don't actually like anymore just because they have a smaller number on them. I know if I continue this I'll end up losing my job and throwing away this apprenticeship course and hurting my mum and boyfriend, but I don't know how to stop myself.\n\nThere aren't any ED services in my area. I largely self-recovered after discharging myself from an inpatient ward, which left behind a lot of old habits and is probably why I'm so prone to struggling. I feel like I'm doomed to live in this cycle because of that.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I am in need of advice/encouragement because it really scares me and I need help to overcome that. Thanks. If you\u2019re continuing below, enjoy the rant :)\n\nI need advice, encouragement, anecdotes, or anything that you think might help. I am just about paralyzed with fear. For context, I have struggled with depression for about 8-9 years now and have dealt with, among other things, bulimia and BED. I was at risk of developing anorexia my freshman year of high school as a result of being bullied extensively for my weight and a number of other things in middle school and by 9th grade I absolutely hated myself, especially my weight, and began to have a strong desire to stop eating. Thankfully, once I started doing so my parents and close friends noticed that something was up and made sure I ate. Even though I was initially resistant, I eventually gave in. I\u2019m really grateful for them for making sure it didn\u2019t get bad for me then. However, that desire to restrict never really dissipated and after trying a bunch of very restrictive diets, I ended up doing a very strict ketogenic diet my junior year of high school. Throughout that year I lost an unhealthy amount of weight and, of course, felt no better about my body image. But that summer, I went on a vacation and figured, \u201ceh, it\u2019s vacation, I can ditch the diet for a bit,\u201d and then it hit me. I would eat until way beyond full and because I felt so ashamed of myself and scared of putting any weight on I would compensate: I would run a mile for every donut I ate until my knees and chest were aching, I\u2019d fast for days, I\u2019d go through multiple bottles of miralax a week, and at it\u2019s worst I began making myself vomit. And that brings us to here, the spring semester of my sophomore year of university. I\u2019ve stopped the purging and compensation but I still have the binges and all the crippling shame that they bring. During all this, way back in my senior year, I started dating a girl at my school. Apparently some people find me attractive, I certainly don\u2019t think I am. I liked her a lot, loved her in fact, but for some reason I couldn\u2019t tell her about any of this: my depression, my social anxiety, the hatred I feel toward myself, and especially NOT my eating disorder. I think I mentioned the depression once looking back but there is no way in hell I would\u2019ve even considered uttering the words \u201ceating disorder\u201d to her. I started smoking weed and all that did was make the binges even worse, and the compensation even more harsh. As I got worse emotionally, all I did was try harder and harder to make sure everything seemed alright. I went to college while she was in her senior year of high school and we decided to keep dating. I started drinking, a lot, to the point where I almost cheated on her a few times. At least that\u2019s what people told me; I don\u2019t remember. Over the summer I still didn\u2019t see her much because I had a job and she went away for the whole summer with her family. Being at work didn\u2019t make it much better, but it did keep me from bingeing all day. Finally, at the beginning of august she came home. I was super excited. We were going to go see one of my best friends in concert with his band and then go see the Rocky Horror Picture show with a group of peers. Everything was going well until we got to the house to pregame the show and a girl who I knew since my freshman year poured an unknown amount of tequila in my mouth. I then finished the box. I don\u2019t remember anything but snippets of her crying, me trying to jump off the roof, and crying myself to sleep on the pool deck after urinating myself for lack of will to move to go to the bathroom. I cheated on her. She was there. We broke up soon after that. I wasn\u2019t present the whole week and was on the cusp of suicide. I saw a therapist and then a psychiatrist and am now on antidepressants, two of them in fact. I\u2019ve stopped the purging and compensation as I mentioned earlier. And, like I also mentioned earlier, I still have the binges and have for a few months. But I have a girlfriend now. That\u2019s what I\u2019m terrified about. I have been much better about communicating with her. I\u2019ve told her about my depression, my anxiety\u2014hell, she\u2019s even seen me have a panic attack. But I still can\u2019t bring my self to say those goddamn five words. I have binge eating disorder. Once those come out of my mouth and go into her ears this whole rant follows without hardship. But those words. Those fucking words. That\u2019s what I need the advice, the encouragement, the quite literally anything for. I need to tell her and I want to. I love her.

Eating less than 1000 a day..", "author": "CodingIsKillingMe", "self_text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI would like to share a short story about myself and the issues I am currently facing.   \nWhen I was a kid my parents divorced (I was about 6) and there was a lot of drama revolving around that event. My mother wasn't mentally stable and would yell at me or blame me for things that were out of my control every time she had to talk with my father (at that time they had to) or I mentioned him, she would freak out on me. I do not know what happened then, but I am assuming it was a result of all the stress, but I would close myself online on browser games for all day lone and just eat junk- waffles mainly. The food seemed to help me cope I suppose. so I just kept on eating.  When I got to my early teens I was  very overweight - 91 kg (I am female) and you know, kids would bully me and all that, but it was okay, up until my own family started doing the same. \"You're fat\", \"Your ass is too big\", \"Start wearing make up so at least you look prettier\" ( I was gifted an actual make up course voucher for my birthday) and all that jazz. Obviously all that think broke my mentality.  I had to change something so started a diet (90 day diet) and doing some sort of sport. I got down to 77. But since I had to weight everything and calculate calories everyday during the diet, that kinda stuck to me. Currently I can't eat without counting and if I eat more than a 1000 I feel guilty, scared and angry at myself for being such a pig. I am afraid that I might go back to \"normal again\". Currently I got to 72, I barely want to eat, I barely eat a 1000 calories a day and I don't know how to cope with it. I am aware it is unhealthy and potentially dangerous for my body in long term, but I can't just break myself to eat more. It is just all the guilt and anxiety that comes back from back in my teen years. Lately I also noticed that if I don't feel hunger then I get sad and when my stomach actually hurts, I feel good, because I know that I haven't eaten that much or at all that day.

This sub is so amazing and filled with remarkable people, so I figure if there's anywhere I can turn for help this is the place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA bit of background: I am a 23 year old male, 6'2\", and anywhere from 144-165 lbs depending on how my month has been going. I've been really struggling with disordered eating and AN since 2014, and I've been vegan for almost 3 years now which really helped me cope with eating more to aid in recovery, and now I'm really in love with the philosophy of veganism and not just the diet (which is a really great small victory for me to celebrate!!) so I'm not worried about that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I first started to experiment with cutting meals as a sophomore in college, I began to love the way it would attract the attention of those around me. As horrible as it sounds, I started to hope that people were talking about me behind my back about how concerned they were for me. It had nothing to do with body image or nutrition (I've always been a skinny guy and had never, up to this point, given any thought to the relationship between my food intake and my body). I should mention that I am an actor and was enrolled in a pretty cutthroat theatre program at the time, which meant that there were all sorts of dieting fads and restrictive behaviors permeating the student body around me, and so it didn't take long for that toxic desire to look a certain way took hold of me too. I mean, if you want to be an actor, you have to have a six pack and perfect jawline, right? The only place for fat men in acting is as the comedic relief of a script--or so the industry had taught us to believe. This image of success combined with my newfound reliance on using food as a means of getting attention built the foundation of my disordered habits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut then Springtime came and I started dating the girl of my dreams. Things got better, in a way. At first, it was an obsession with the gym and actually eating MORE, because I had a friend who truly had the most perfect male physique I have ever seen in person and he would take me to the gym with him and out to dinner after (I was still eating meat then). I wanted to be his protege! Impress my girlfriend! It actually became a healthy obsession and I was up to about 170 lbs with great muscular composition. As I began to look more full-bodied and toned, I had less of a desire to skip meals and cause concern in my friends and family. Summer break started and my GF and I worked separate jobs at theatres several states away from each other, so our relationship was long distance. I continued to workout, but because I no longer had a weight room like I did at my school, I began to do more cardio and body weight exercises. I would run every morning for miles, then go on extremely rigorous hikes several times a week and focus on core workouts when I was at home. This, of course, led to me losing some of my muscle mass and becoming a lankier, skinny, toned guy again. I liked this new me. Instead of being bulky like Thor, I could just be toned like all my favorite rock climbers and hikers! I was still enjoying foods like pizza, cookie dough, chips and salsa, and other fun snacks that now terrify me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI came back to school and almost instantly my girlfriend broke up with me out of the blue. I later found out she was seeing another guy at her summer job. I couldn't be anywhere near her because it would make me so sad to be reminded of how great she was. Problem was, we were a part of the same friend group that did everything together, including eating meals at the dining halls. And so, I stopped going out. I became a complete hermit and would avoid joining that friend group for any activities because it would trigger thoughts of the best friend I had lost in her. I began to go to a daily meditation club during my lunchtimes instead of eating, and I would start every day with a 2-3 mile run and then go swim at least 1000m at the gym. Plus I would bike to every class. I would have an apple in the morning (after my run and swim) and then nothing until dinner, which was usually just some rice, a salad, and some fruit. I started to gain the attention and worry of my friends again. I hated myself for the concern I was giving them, but I couldn't stop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I became addicted to the physical sensation of waking up feeling completely empty. I loved feeling my stomach growl for 10 seconds at a time as I was running, or the bit of light-headedness I would get as I climbed out of the pool after my laps. It was like a high. Unlike any other feeling I've experienced. I became vegan because a friend wanted me to do it with him, but it wasn't really a change for me at all since I was basically just eating fruits and grains anyway. I got to to 140 lbs (30 lb drop) before I stopped weighing myself, so who knows just how low I got. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt never felt like it had anything to do with eating disorders, though. I still loved food. I was just depressed and didn't want to be around people, and I *no longer thought anything of my hunger*. But then one day I was confronted with the reality that I was subconsciously avoiding food and weight gain. It was the day of the Super Bowl, and I went home to watch with family. We, of course, ate so much food--chips, dips, cake, fried foods, etc.--and I remember mid-way through the night becoming absolutely overwhelmed with guilt and shame. *How could I eat this much? My stomach is going to burst through my fragile ribcage!* I vowed that I wouldn't eat the next day to make up for it. I had never done something like this (no eating for a day) on purpose before, but this time I felt like I needed to get my body back in line. I ended up going on a water fast for 4 days. Still exercising daily, attending class, etc, but not consuming a single morsel of substance. I even stopped using toothpaste.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lost my libido entirely, and still today feel very little physical attraction or arousal for anyone or anything. I just no longer care enough to go on dates, can't deal with the pressure of eating with somebody who is more focused on me than the food they're putting into their mouths while I feel more and more disgusting with every bite, and I have no physical desires strong enough to lure me into hookups like apparently everyone around me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted nothing more than to lose so much weight that eventually the wind would blow and carry me away like a tumbleweed. That goal still lives in the dark recesses of my mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, a few weeks after my first water fast, one of my professors was supposed to meet me outside of class. I was extremely lightheaded that day and blacking out every time I stood up (as had become typical for me), and I accidentally missed the appointment. I went to his office that afternoon to apologize and explain myself, and I realized it was the first time I really spoke out loud about any of it. And I realized how ashamed and embarrassed it made me feel. He convinced me to talk to my family and eat more diligently, but he still said \"It's a good thing we caught this early, otherwise it could have developed into a real eating disorder.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't note the significance of that at the time, and I went forward with my determined plan to recover. I told my mom and best friend that I was struggling with eating enough and needed their help to recover, and they had similar reactions to my professor. They believed that my under eating was just a result of the stress of school and that I had fortunately caught this in the nick of time. Nobody would label what I was going through as an eating disorder. NOBODY. Still, I thought nothing of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started to recover by becoming active in the kitchen; if I developed a relationship with the food that I was cooking, I was less likely to see it as a number (calories) and instead see it as something I was proud of creating and could take delight in eating and sharing with those around me. Hooray! All recovered, right?? No, of course not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then (3 or 4 years), I have had so many relapses and serious troubles when it comes to eating. And I always find some excuse to justify it, like not having enough money to eat more than one meal a day (which has actually been true in several instances), being too busy, being vegan, working too hard, or even my hiking of the Appalachian Trail last spring (which was another huge blow to my relationship with food, but that's another story entirely). My weight has fluctuated between the same 30 pound range, and I spend about a quarter of the year obsessed with growing muscle and the other 3/4 obsessed with cardio and becoming scrawny again. But even now I hesitate to say that I have an eating disorder. And I don't dare bring it up to anyone again out of fear that they'll just dismiss it as the byproduct of one of the aforementioned factors again. Is there anybody who can call me on my bullshit and just tell me that I have a problem and need help??? Or are they all right and I'm just labeling perfectly human behaviors as an eating disorder??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so lost. Especially in the acting community, behaviors like skipping meals and avoiding many types of food just seem so commonplace that nobody even bothers talking about them or showing worry for you when you exhibit these behaviors. It's like a competition! And on top of that, every time the subject of eating disorders comes up in the news, in conversation, in reading, etc., it's always viewed as an exclusively female problem. I am a very comfortably effeminate man, don't get me wrong. And I seriously empathize with and understand how much harder society's expectations can pressure a woman into this myriad of disorders. But there are a lot of people around me who would simply not take me seriously if I claimed myself to have an ED, strictly because they don't believe that men can suffer from those.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then there's the public perception of what an ED looks like. Most people seem to believe that it isn't an eating disorder until that individual is an absolutely emaciated form of skin and bones who is forcibly admitted to an in-patient care center and fed mush through a tube. That's why I can't open up to the people in my life: because they've *seen worse.* My case simply isn't strong enough.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I guess what I need to know is how can I go about recovering and feeling like I deserve to be seeking help? At what point can I justify the need for outside assistance? Or are my loved ones right in saying that we caught this early and that I can just keep toughing it out?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hate hating myself. I hate causing concern in those around me. But most of all, I hate that I crave the concern and hatred and feelings of physical emptiness when I lay down in bed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR I finally believe that I have an ED, but I don't think anybody will believe me. What do I do?", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I knew it was over once I got up from the table after  clearing my plate, I just started ravaging the kitchen for anything else I could shove into my stupid mouth.

I will try to make this short lol. \n\nI have always been chubby. Even as a little kid. For as long as I could remember my family life revolved around food, cookouts, any type of event there was a whole bunch of food. My grandfather would always yell at us and make us feel bad if we didn\u2019t eat what was on our plate. So you bet I always ate my plate clean. I lost my dad when I was 10 (about to be 25 now) and it just crushed my whole world so I turned to food. Since then I\u2019ve gained so much weight. I got married, and he turned out to be an abusive, lying, cheating, and controlling person. So of course I ate.. and ate and it made me feel secure. \n\nI finally got the courage to leave. And after gaining probably 75 pounds from emotional eating I decided I wanted to lose weight so I did Herbalife and lost 50 pounds. I was feeling great!!

Since then, I\u2019ve gained back about 45 pounds and my food addiction is worse than ever.  Today I put on a pair of jeans that fit last month and they wouldn\u2019t button. I was devastated.

I also want to say that, as someone who has experienced it, the feeling of overcoming this is absolutely worth the struggle. The renewed confidence and comfort in body and - more importantly - mind can allow you to approach challenges previously unthinkable. \n\nDespite this positivity however I do remind you that this battle is not fought and won like the battle with say, disease. Rather it is a continued balance of order and chaos, bearing greater resemblance to the struggle of a 'now clean, once alcoholic'. I make no bones about it that, at any time, if your buttons are pushed the right way and your mindset is not on point; there remains potential for old demons to rear their ugly head.\n\nFor me, curing binge eating comprised of 2 steps. The first, gaining control over my external environment (to the greatest degree possible). What external actions play into binge eating for you? for me it was over-exercise and over use of pornography/masturbation. The combination of these two meant that I had huge fluctuations in hormone/energy levels throughout the week as well as a reduced ability to delay gratification. Exercise in particular (though of course great for cardiovascular, joint, muscular and often mental health) can have the unintended effect of hormonal swings in the body. This spurring things like, more regular pornography use, spurring more hormonal highs and lows, spurring a crazy desire to eat. After 4 years of running this cycle on a weekly (sometimes daily) basis; the decision to moderate exercise, and a mindful move to use things like pornography minimally, greatly levelled out my hormonal balance.\n\nManaging these external stressors halted binge eating, however, one must remember that it is a vacuum that must be filled. The second element is the management of the internal, your mindset. For me, a re-orientation toward learning and focus on self-care and self-love aided me. I viewed myself as a custodian of the body, not its owner. As a thoughtful young man I had a responsibility to care for myself so that I could care for others ('put on your own oxygen mask before assisting others'). He who was sufficient why, can suffer any how. I had a why, I had mantra's I would recite multiples times everyday. Yeah if a passerby was in my head they might think I was a little crazy; but I'll tell you what, I felt a lot more crazy when I was downing 5000 calories with no idea why. I think everyone who binge eats hates them self in some way, I certainly did and to some extent still do. Hate is easy, the challenge is to find what you love about yourself, what's worth protecting, what would the world miss if you can't be you because of this horrible disorder. I viewed my mind and body as partners, who wanted to build a life together, a marriage of sorts. In marriage you have to be compassionate, you have to want the best for your partner, you have allow the other to make you better than you would be alone. \n\nThe best thing about this is the more tuned in the two get, the easier it is. To the point that, when you look back over the past 6 months or year when you haven't felt any need to binge, you realise that it is something so distant from you that you no longer recognise it. You will never get out of this pit through hating yourself, you have to view yourself as someone you are responsible for helping. I know it seems hopeless right now, you're probably stumbling about in the dark like I was for years. Yet when you first get traction and develop a clear image and pattern of success, you have a north star. If life eventually beats you down and you fall into old patterns, you can always look up and find your way back to order. This distinction alone (between complete darkness and and a darkness punctuated by a guiding light) is life changing in and of itself. I believe you can find it, but the question that really matters is, do you?\n\n(I hope this helps some people and if anyone has specific questions don't hesitate to send me a message, if my knowledge or experience can help in any way that would be awesome)\n\n(I should also add, I am still managing this disorder into my larger life. I gained control and mastery in one domain, however having recently returned to training 5-6 times per week, I see that this poses a whole new challenge, but with the presence of a north star, a pattern that I know works for me, I am positive I can bring these things into my life and still find balance)", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

Nevertheless, I am experiencing CRAZY hunger. I have slept terribly for several days in a row because I wake up in the middle of night with hunger pangs and images of food crowding my head. I go to bed hungry and wake up hungry. I am hungry after lunch and after dinner. And it's not like I am limiting my calories - I am eating a healthy number of calories each day, with a fair intake of proteins, carbs, fats and fibers. Yet right now I am sitting here at my desk, crying in shame after having binged on a literal pound of cereals because after dinner the hunger was just unbearable and after days and days and days of resisting it I just couldn't tolerate it anymore.\n\nAnd I am still thinking about food - in fact I am already daydreaming about what I will eat tomorrow.\n\nThe ED developed during a period of my life where things were going down the drain, but in the last couple of months it was all going so much better and I had managed to stick to 3 meals a day and maintain my weight. Yet lately the hunger has become crazy and the urges to binge have grown stronger and stronger. I now feel horribly bloated and fat and I believe the n-th relapse is around the corner. I can't stand it and don't know what to do. I am so scared that recently to combat the hunger I have been eating loads of veggies and drinking liters after liters of water and zero calorie sodas, to the point of experiencing very bad water intoxication and nearly having to go to the hospital.\n\nI am horribly scared, I feel like my worst ED fears are becoming finally true and this time I am actually becoming fat.

Very short and not enough time bc insurance is a b\\*tch. After I left I promptly got a job with Walgreens. Past work experiences are what triggered my ed in the first place so that was even more of a challenge being in a recovery center for too short of a time and then working soon after. Anyways, recently in the past month or so I have become afraid of gaining weight again. I now weigh 185 lbs which is not underweight for somebody who is 6'3\" but if I let this go any longer it will get lower and lower. I got to 190 after I got out but so far have lost 5 lbs in the past 2 weeks or so. I have been restricting to like 400-500 calories a day and whenever I do eat I bing and purge. I have a normal meal about every other day and when I do I almost always attempt to purge that as well. I restrict so hard throughout the day that it causes me to be so hungry and then that triggers the b/p episodes. Before this I would just restrict and occasionally purge but not binge. I do believe this time my ed is worse than it was before. My therapist has urged me to go back to the clinic again. I have just become so numb to it that there is only a small part of me that cares and wants to get help again. That part of me wants to get help because I really do see a future for myself. I now have a boyfriend who I really love and care about. He loves me and cares about me too. He has been so supportive of me through my ed struggle. I do feel guilty sometimes though for how much I worry him, even though he tells me not to feel guilty for it. My depression is almost unnoticeable because of medication and therapy. I have started my new job that has great management unlike my last job at CVS. (My manager was a pathological lying b\\*tch.) It does still stress me out though because customer service can be really mentally draining. I am going to be starting school soon to get my associates. During that time I will be figuring out what I want to do as a career which will definitely be in the medical field because that's what I've always wanted. That stresses me out too because I've never done college before so it's a new experience for me. I also don't quite know the exact career path I want to follow and that puts a lot of pressure on me. So there are things that are stressing me out currently and I believe that is what triggered this relapse. Specifically work, school and body issues. Anyways I'm working on getting back into the clinic but I can only do IOP this time because of work.

I literally fell asleep in group quite often.\n\n- They\u2019re not very trans accepting. I was identifying as some kinda woman while I was there, but now I know I\u2019m transmasc and things have changed. There was a trans guy there when I was there, and since it was a \u201cfemale only\u201d program they constantly misgendered him. God forbid I was a trans woman, I doubt they\u2019d even let me in.\n\n- My insurance didn\u2019t cover it completely and it was *fucking expensive.*\n\n- They kicked me out of outpatient because they couldn\u2019t (or wouldn\u2019t) deal with my cutting and suicidal ideation.\n\n- The girls, especially the young ones, were so catty and competitive. They low key compared meal plans, weights, and body sizes, and sometimes fed off each other to restrict and get sicker. It felt like a real life proana board sometimes.\n\n- There was such a focus on restriction in particular and girls with bulimia or BED got pushed to the side. Only in private was I able to discuss my own binging and purging. Even though I was one of the skeletal anorexic girls, I felt ashamed, like I didn\u2019t fit in and couldn\u2019t discuss my b/p even though binging, with or without purging, was and is a big component in my eating disorder.\n\n- Having to wait in long lines to take my stupid medication three times a day. \n\n- All the psychiatrists I met were idiots. Especially the one in outpatient.\n\n- The absolute misery surrounding me. Starting out in trays, around girls half finishing their meals, refusing supplements, getting away with hiding food and using food rituals. People breaking down crying at meals, especially on dessert days. Otherwise, the dining room was silent other than the sound of silverware clinking. It was oppressive. \n\n- The sickest girl there. She was thinner than everyone else. She got tubed because she was *losing* weight. She hid her food in her mouth and spit it out in the trash can. When she wasn\u2019t refusing to put it in her mouth at all. She\u2019d been there for months, and they eventually sent her to inpatient. And I\u2019m not proud of this, but I was so rude to her because I *hated* myself for not being that sick. To be fair, she low key bragged about it too. \n\n- They put *ridiculous* restrictions on what we were allowed to read. They always rejected the books my mom brought me. I\u2019ve been in the psych ward seven fucking times, I tried to fucking kill myself and they let me read whatever I wanted. It was an absolute crock of shit. \n\n- This is petty but I had to wake up at 3 am every morning to get weighed. I hated it.\n\n- But finally - it\u2019s way too much emotional work for me to handle right now. I danced around my trauma with my therapist. There were days they put a binge food in front of me and *I* was the one breaking down sobbing. I was dragged down by the struggles of the people around me even on the days I personally was thriving. There was the time in group where we had to watch a clip of Man vs. Food. And I was tired, I hated myself every day. Right now I\u2019m really struggling. I\u2019m cutting every day. I\u2019m not strong right now. I\u2019m not in the same headspace that I was when I made the decision to go to res.\n\nI KNOW a *huge* part of the reason I don\u2019t want help is stubbornness and a ridiculous feeling that I don\u2019t deserve help. Or even that I don\u2019t want to lose my \u201cprogress,\u201d or the amount of weight I\u2019ve lost. But there are plenty of legitimate reasons that I hide behind too.\n\nI went to a diner with my grandmother today. I ate a half pound burger and fries. She said, \u201cSo I guess that means your eating is on track now?\u201d I told her yes, and she told me she loved me and that it made her so happy, even though I admitted that I continue to have an on-again off-again relationship with my eating disorder.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t tell her was that I had planned this meal in advance, and plan to starve for a long time to \u201cmake up for it.\u201d I\u2019ll probably fast for at least a day. It\u2019d break her heart if I told her the truth.\n\nYet, I don\u2019t want to do the whole recovery thing again. For all the reasons listed above (and tbh all the annoying hokey bullshit it comes with).\n\nThere\u2019s really no satisfying conclusion to this story, no neat way to wrap up this post.

Eating is a daily issue for me but I'm confused on where I fit on the spectrum of eating disorders. Although mentally, the issues are consistent, physically my habits happen in phases/cycles. And by this I mean, I've had body dysmorphia since I was probably 13. My disordered eating started though when I was about 16. I'm 27 now. When I was 16 i was diagnosed with a minor learning disability and started taking medication for it. The medication suppressed my appetite completely. Prior, I had tried to restrict food but I never had the strength to commit. Having no appetite made me feel euphoric. I was on a high. I was losing weight rapidly and didn't want it to end. I never felt like it was enough. So I would go back to my doctor and pretend I needed a higher dose of the meds for my learning disability when in reality I just wanted to keep losing weight. This went on for three years. After three years I stopped taking the medication because I wasn't in school anymore. My appetite returned, I gained all my weight back and went through a deep depression about it. I would try restricting again on my own, but it didn't work out. That's when I started purging. I guess I would say I binge eat, on a smaller scale because I do feel as though I lose control when I'm eating. And have always felt that way. So I would start purging to rid myself of that guilt. Anyway, this leads me to where I am today. Since then, I cycle through phases where I will purge for a month or two and then stop for a few months and then the cycle happens again. I feel guilty allowing myself to believe this could be an eating disorder because it's not physically persistent. In a way, I don't want to take away from people who deal with the physical behaviours daily. I just feel lost. Anyone else relate to this? I guess I'm just looking for validation/clarity.\n\nTL;DR : been battling issues w food for several years but the physical behaviours of an eating disorder aren't consistent and happen in phases. Confused on where I stand on the spectrum on ED's.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I have  been bullied by my peers, or my relatives would talk shit about my  appearance behind my back etc etc. Three years ago, I started caring  about what I eat and lost a shit ton of weight. \n\nCurrently, my BMI is healthy but I feel like it\u2019s not enough because I  still have big thighs, big arms, big belly. For the past two years or  so, I\u2019ve not lost any weight. But I admit the way I maintain my weight  or even lose some is not healthy. \n\nFor example, I will try different diets- keto, eating clean or  intermittent fasting. None of them lasted because I kept binging. The  period for my diet is a few days and binge days a few days as well.  During these binge episodes, I go to the kitchen at midnight and eat  whatever I wanted because I don\u2019t want my family to find out and be  angry at my unhealthy eating habits. I would stash the food packaging  underneath the trash so its not visible.  Also, once I start binging I  just feel so out of control and I keep reaching for food. At that moment  it seems like my only comfort is the eating of food, not the food and  the taste itself. Because afterwards, when I look at other girls  beautiful figures, I start feeling guilty and self conscious once again.  This endless cycle goes on and on that I\u2019m so tired of it. I still  haven\u2019t lost any weight.\n\nI do not purge, but when I diet I count my calories. I restrict what I  eat. I also go to the gym and workout but not excessively because I\u2019m  still pretty weak. Usually, at the beginning of the diet, I would feel  very good and healthy- but afterwards just miserable because I just want  to have snacks. After I allow myself a cookie, the binge episode will  begin again.\n\nI do pretty well with school, I have a loving family and good  friends- my only problem with life is my body. I really want to lose my  fat mass and gain some muscle but nothing has worked out for me. I have  too low of a willpower. Also, I\u2019m aware that I\u2019m at stake of having an  eating disorder, but sometimes I feel like Im not which is why I\u2019m here  asking for help. I\u2019m also afraid that going to therapy sessions would be  costly as my tuition fees are already a burden for my parents. So  should I seek for professional help for my unhealthy relationship with  food?", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

That was a lunch consisting of a 400 calorie bowl of cereal, after which I planned to have soup or some small for dinner. But of course somehow my hands found themselves on the pizza app and suddenly there's a knock at the door and the devil is presenting me with a medium stuffed crust pizza, chicken strips, doughballs, and cookies. In fifteen minutes all that remained were three slices of pizza.\n\nAs always, I vow to do better tomorrow. 'i will have this last binge, and tomorrow, no excuses. I will restrict or at least stick to 1200. Absolutely.'\n\nAnd I do ok. I don't eat all day. And suddenly it's late and my partner is home later than usual because of a meeting and we're both too tired to cook and suddenly I'm eating a medium kebab, cheesy chips, scampi, and onion rings.\n\nAnd today I'm wearing some trousers (more like leggings but they're not a sheer material, they're classed as 'office wear'). My belly rolls over the top because, whilst they're high waisted, the waist stops just short of where I like it, so it allows room for my muffin top. I'm hyper aware of how, when I sit down, my legs look like two fucking hams crammed in to trousers. \n\nLast summer for one glorious moment I got to under 9 stone, but I fell back in to old eating habits. I got complacent and I'm now back up to 10 stone and it won't shift because I can't stop with the 'just one more binge won't hurt' cycle. I feel amazing the day after a 1200 calorie OMAD. But today I feel like I'm back at my starting weight, which was 14 stone (200lbs). \n\nHow do I stop the self loathing? The panic? What if I'm like this forever? When I started weight loss I sometimes didn't even struggle with a 900 calorie day, sometimes 700.

I'll try to keep this brief and straight to the point. I've been struggling with orthorexia for 6 years now, and in the last few months it's been especially bad. So bad that I've ended up with a BMI of 17.2. I've never been underweight before, and honestly I've never wanted to be. \n\nI used to be perfectly happy with maintaining a BMI between 18.5 and 19, but following a health scare (everything is fine now) I started restricting my caloric intake. Chronometer has been my best friend, basically I've been playing a game of \"how can I hit most of my essential nutrients targets with the least amount of food?\".\n\nRight now I'm trying really hard to recover. In the last couple of weeks I've been in a much better place mentally, and I've managed not to lose anymore weight. I don't think I'll be ready to try and get back to a healthy weight anytime soon, but I'll be happy if I can at least maintain for a while.\n\nThere is one thing that is worrying me a lot though: I haven't had a period in almost two months. The last time I had one it was two weeks late and very short and light. I'm afraid that my weight loss has fucked up my hormones. I don't want to hurt myself. I want my body to be healthy. I'm trying not to panic, I'm telling myself that there may be other factors at play, but I'm really terrified. \n\nSo, to everyone that has lost their period as a consequence of being underweight: when did that happen? How low was your BMI at that point? What did you do to make it come back?\n\nIt's weird, nobody likes to bleed from their vagina, but I really want my period to be regular again.\n\nIf you've had the patience to read all of this crap, thank you.

If I bring this topic up, its not a safe space. I don't feel exactly comfortable explaining how im feeling to anyone. \n\nThis overwhelming dread and desire to be the stereotypical man makes you want to stay inside all day and watch Netflix feeling sad about yourself.

I am more stressed than ever. Some of it was just luck, some of it was down to people just not thinking things through. Either way, as usual I've ended up mopping it all up.\n\nSo today I gave up. I ate sourdough toast with honey, I ate several bowls of rice and chorizo, I ate a too-big portion of bean chilli with too much cheddar on the top. I ate oatcakes and pate and butter and cheese and cherry shortbread and kitkats and chocolate. Then I ate some more.\n\nI feel sick and totally disgusted and heartbroken. I'd have to estimate today's intake at somewhere north of 5000 calories. I feel like I'm in mourning for my lost week (how melodramatic is that!) and I feel resentful that I've ended up nursing others and doing fetching and carrying on my precious week off. I know binging has only made it worse. I don't have any coping mechanisms other than this maladaptive behaviour.\n\nAt least I managed to stay off the wine so won't be hungover in the morning. There's a positive there at least.\n\nI don't think I can ever beat this right now. Tonight was the worst in a long long time. But I don't think it's going to be the last. I feel broken.

Maybe it was the stress, the hypoglycemia, or the fatigue from not sleeping, but I just lost it. I stepped away from the counter and  started sobbing- I couldn't stop, something broke inside me.

I did a six mile run on Sunday, and did four miles on Monday &amp; Wednesday.  I strength train Tues, Thurs, and Sat for a hour and a fifteen minutes.  And I basically rest one day a week.  I have been doing SO well in fact... I skipped dinner last night and breakfast this morning so I could pig out with a friend today at PF Chang\u2019s after work.  Everything was fine.   \n\nThen I broke.  \n\nI was fine at first.  I had the lettuce wraps, the pork dumplings fried(4), the egg rolls, and 2 spoon fulls of my friends shrimp fried rice.  GREAT!  I had just about the calories for that.  \n\nThen I got the banana egg rolls dessert.  And it all went downhill after that.  \n\nI felt myself shifting into binge mode.  I stopped and got 5 full size cow tail candies on the way home.  Ate those.   Wasn\u2019t enough.  \n\nThen I made a batch of about 30 cinnamon-sugar fried tortilla chips.  *I\u2019m COOKING at this point.  After I JUST stuffed myself at the restaurant.  How psychotic it\u2019s that??!!!  Smh*   So at this point, I truly believe psychology is either numbing the actual stretching of my stomach, or possibly if in binge mode, I literally just may have more stomach space.  Who knows.  Idk.  It could be a medical phenomenon.   \n\nSo, I\u2019m STUFFED at this point.  I FEEL it.  But, what do I do??  Well, I\u2019m currently in bed with a 20-piece nugget that I DROVE to McDonald\u2019s to get.  DROVE!!!   That is PSYCHOTIC!!!!!!!!!\n\nSo this is how I know when I\u2019m bingeing I\u2019m not in my right mind and binge eating is all in the mind...\n\nAs I\u2019m eating the nuggets dipping them in sauce, I\u2019m practically crying, begging... pleading with my mind like ...please binge... come on... be over soon.  Because at this point I literally feel like I have no control over my body and my arms are just moving.  It\u2019s crazy.  I feel like my body, my stomach, and my mind are three separate entities.   This is the first time I\u2019ve ever felt so disconnected.  I feel like I\u2019m having an actual psychotic episode.  I hear my brain screaming, \u201cWhat are you doing you\u2019re ruining everything!!!!!\u201d   But I can\u2019t stop.  Usually I\u2019m totally submersed in my binges, but I think coming off a long run of some seriously psychically active days, I\u2019m able to see a little clearer.  During this binge I felt so disjointed.  It was so weird.  That\u2019s when it hit me like omg, binges are located in the brain!  They have NOTHING to do with my actual hands and mouth.  It was pretty profound (for me at least) to be in a moment recognizing I had no control over my body.   \n\n(A little background about me, food has always been a struggle.  My highest weight was about 7 years ago when I weighed around 280.  I\u2019m about 200 lbs now and my goal weight is 165.  So you can see this has been a jouuurrnnneyyy.  But it\u2019s picking up steam!!!  I\u2019m seeing differently and it\u2019s so exciting!!!  I\u2019m trying to BEAT THIS!!!!!)\n\nI just wanted to share my journey entry of sorts in case anyone might be thinking bingeing is primarily because we like the taste of FOOD.  Bingeing is psychological.  You have to get inside your MIND.  Feel yourself switching into that binge mode and begin to recognize what the shift feels like.   It\u2019s almost like a mood disorder.   Learn to recognize your shifts so you can corner those feelings like, \u201ca-ha!  It\u2019s you again!  I\u2019m in a binge mode!\u201d So you can isolate that incident, reprimanded yourself, and use that as encouragement to push on!!!  That\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do!!!

It seems to break the illusion of escape and distancing from oneself that fosters binge eating. To watch yourself binge eating is confronting.

I'm working with my therapist on my binge eating, and the other day at my psychiatrist appointment I mentioned that I struggle with binge eating, and she decided to switch me from concerta to vyvanse. There are 2 things I'm worried about. 1, I already tried vyvanse for 3 months in high school and it didn't help much with my ADHD so I switched back to concerta. I told my psychiatrist this and she said to try it anyway, but I'm really worried that it won't work, and that I'll fail my classes. 2, I'm really not sure about using an appetite suppressant to treat my binge eating. I'm afraid that it'll trigger my past restriction habits and just make everything worse. Luckily I have to wait a week for the pharmacy to fill it so I will get a chance to talk to my therapist about this before I start taking it, but I just wanted to see what you guys think.

While I no longer suffer from a full blown eating disorder, anorexia and bulimia controlled my life from ages 12-17.5 so I thought this would be fitting as my first post. I\u2019m 19 now just FYI. I figured this sort of thing wouldn\u2019t be allowed on the main ED sub so I\u2019ll have a go at this one. TLDR at bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Backstory**\n\nI will try to keep the backstory as concise as possible. I\u2019ll start off by saying that I did not hit puberty until I was almost 16, which happens to be around the time this incident takes place (I believe it was a few months after turning 16). From ages 12-15 I was mostly anorexic, but things never got \u201cbad\u201d enough for any intervention because every few months I would binge and purge for a few weeks and gain some of the weight back. Since I still had the body of a 10 year old, I was consistently very skinny, even with reasonable weight gain. This all changed halfway through age 15.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I hit puberty it felt like my life was over. I had it in my head that I would eventually get my period, but nothing else would happen to my body other than maybe getting taller. Funnily enough, I never did get taller. It was if a switch had flipped and the dull aching hunger that I had grown to thrive off of was completely yanked from underneath me only to be replaced with an inescapable and primal urge to eat 3 meals a day. *Like a crazy person*, I thought at the time. I somehow began to eat relatively normally for about five months and by 16 I felt unrecognizable to my previous self. Looking back I really wasn\u2019t, I just happened to be a normal weight and wore a bra size that wasn\u2019t AA. I began restricting again but soon realized that my body was still developing and this hunger wasn\u2019t going away anytime soon so I instead focused my efforts on purging anything that entered my body. It worked, to a degree, as I was maintaining my normal weight, but I couldn't for the life of me get back to my pre-pubescent, Twiggy-esque physique. So I just tried harder. By the time this incident took place I was purging anywhere from 2 to 5 separate times a day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The** ***Incident***\n\nWhat I've decided to call \"the incident\" occurred late one evening in the spring/summer of my sophomore year in HS. After eating a considerable amount of spaghetti for dinner, I run upstairs to take care of it like usual. By considerable amount of spaghetti, I mean bowls and bowls of it. I honestly don\u2019t know why no one in my family said something because this was not normal behavior and they had previously commented on my eating \"habits\" for much less. Like clockwork, I go upstairs, turn the shower on, put my hair in a bun and prepare to empty myself of whatever it is I don't want to feel. In a moment I can only describe now as transcendent, my mind completely leaves my physical body as I purge. I had felt disconnected from myself during purges on occasion, but never to the point where I essentially blacked out. I don\u2019t know how long I was throwing up and I definitely didn\u2019t know how MUCH I was throwing up because when I finally came to, the toilet bowl was almost filled to the brim with noodles, tomato sauce, and anything else I had eaten in the last week that managed to evade earlier purges. My next move makes the cut for one of my more serious lapses in judgement. I undress, flush the ridiculously full toilet, and get in the running shower to wash off any remaining filth. I\u2019m still in a bit of a weird state so instead of getting back out so I can double flush/purge more, I stay in the shower for 10 more minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe sheer panic that washed over me when I yanked open the shower curtain that night is something I\u2019ll likely never forget. The entire floor of my tiny bathroom is flooded and not just toilet water flooded. I'm talking disgusting, vomit chunk, spaghetti noodle, marinara sauce water flooded. As I look at the door I can see water running into the other section of my bathroom. My heart immediately drops as I realize this could easily be game over and my \"little secret\u201d will now be public knowledge to my whole family. I pray the damage isn\u2019t too humiliating as I make my way into the sink room (?)  connected to my bathroom. Unfortunately, this room is pretty flooded too. Not as bad as the first, but the entire tile floor is soaked and a trail of water is continuing out to the middle of the hallway. Never thought I would say this, but I have never been more grateful for having severe asthma as a child to the point where we couldn\u2019t have any carpeted floors in our house because that situation definitely would have been too much to handle on my own. Anyways, my panic level goes up to about 1 million when I remember that it's 8pm and everyone in the house is very much awake and my sister is just down the hall in her room. I knew I had to do something *FAST* because I had already been in the shower for close to 30 minutes and eventually someone was gonna come upstairs and tell me to get out, but I also couldn\u2019t turn the shower off now because then my sister might come out and try to use the bathroom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy first course of action is to clean the hall as it had the least damage and from what I had gathered when I first saw the toilet, fixing the plumbing situation was going to be a much longer endeavor. I grab as many towels as I can to clean up the mess and also one to wear so if someone comes upstairs and sees me cleaning up spaghetti vomit water from the hallway floor, at least I won't be butt ass naked too. First, I put towels underneath the two doors to stop any more water from getting out. Then I clean up the water from the hallway and collect any and all food remains. Easy enough. I move back into the sink room which is generally the same deal as the hall except longer. Panic level rises yet again when I realize the shower has been on hot water this whole time and the steam from this particular shower would sometimes set off the smoke detector placed right outside the bathroom. Finally, I make my way to the bathroom where shit hit the fan and at this point I'm just waiting for someone to catch me. That doesn\u2019t stop me from hoping for the best and doing damage control though. I put the towel back under the door, drench a few towels while soaking up the ridiculous amount of water on the floor and go to address the toilet. Whatever food that didn\u2019t make its way onto my floor had formed to create a full block in the flush hole. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s called but the place where the water flushes down was almost inaccessible. I know what I have to do, but I'm so unfazed by my own self-inflicted chaos at this point that I don\u2019t even blink. I stick my hand in the toilet and start grabbing as much food as I can. I know I can\u2019t put it in the shower because it would clog the drain so I start making piles of vomit on my bathroom floor. I keep grabbing handfuls and making piles until I get to the point where I have to stick my hand and half of my forearm into the toilet hole and pull fucking noodle clumps out from there. God, just typing this sentence out makes me cringe. I was completely unfazed by the vomit but having to stick my arm that far down a toilet was unsettling, to say the least. Once I unclog the toilet, I realize I have to get rid of these piles fast enough so I can get out of this whole thing without being caught but not so fast that I flush too much at once and the toilet overflows again. I don\u2019t remember how many flushes it took but I eventually got rid of all evidence and turned the shower off with no outside interference. To this day I don\u2019t know how no one in my family noticed the insane number of times I flushed or the fact that these flushes occurred after being \"in the shower\" for close to 45 minutes but I\u2019m incredibly grateful because if I were a parent and caught my child in the situation I was in on this night, I would enforce immediate psychiatric help. Getting caught could have possibly sped up my recovery, who knows, but I can list about a thousand scenarios off the top of my head which involve my ED being exposed that I would prefer to this gigantic mess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight after this happened I was kind of in a state of shock. Obviously it wasn\u2019t the worst thing in the world and probably wouldn't be considered that crazy by some, but it really put things in perspective for me. In the moment I was only concerned about getting caught, not about how utterly ridiculous it is for a 16 year old, or anyone for that matter, to find themselves in this sort of situation. It really made me self evaluate and later helped serve as one of my motivations for getting better, so, as embarrassing as this whole thing was and still is, I am definitely grateful for it in a way. I also think this was my first big and impactful wake up call where I realized and fully accepted that the stuff I was doing wasn't normal and it wasn't something I could pass off as a bad habit. At the time I was so ashamed and embarrassed by the fact that I was capable of something like this, I mean, who DOES this shit. I felt disgusting and like I was completely crazy, but more than anything I just felt ashamed. Ashamed that my life had come like this and ashamed that I couldn't just eat normally and be skinny and happy like my friends. I think outsiders are able to see eating disorders at face value as destructive food related behavior, but I don't think many people realize the lengths to which an eating disorder can take a person in pursuit of continuing and hiding their destructive behavior. The shame associated with reaching these lengths as they go further and further is honestly indescribable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnly two people in my personal life know this story as of now, my sister and my best friend, both of whom I trust deeply with personal, yet ridiculous shit like this. They were both understandably shocked when I shared this story but I\u2019m at a point in my life where I can genuinely laugh at it now. It wasn\u2019t funny then and I guess it still isn\u2019t funny because it is objectively pretty messed up but I don\u2019t really care. I can acknowledge the severity of my disease while also laughing at this crazy byproduct of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;** Had anorexia. Hit puberty. Had bulimia. Ate a shit ton of spaghetti one night, went to purge, had an out of body experience mid-purge, flush toilet FILLED with puke and get in shower only to get out and find 3 rooms flooded with spaghetti vomit water. Cleaned that shit up then had to stick half of my arm down the toilet to get clogged food chunks out. Made piles of vomit on my floor to flush in \u201csections\u201d as to not repeat the situation. Made me take a long hard look at myself and my actions. Eventually recovered (for the most part). Can laugh at story now\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*EDIT*: After re-reading this to check for errors I thought to myself, 'What on earth did you do with those nasty ass towels.' I honestly can't remember, but I'm assuming I washed the gross shit out of them myself in my shower and then let them dry in my room and slowly brought them down throughout the next week or so to the washing machine in my parents bathroom. No way I brought like 10 vomit-stench towels downstairs like it was no big deal.\n\n*EDIT 2*: I also want to mention something regarding the shower and it running for so long. This is one of my biggest regrets in regards to my eating disorder. So many are dying of thirst and I was able to just flippantly waste gallons of water on numerous occasions just because I didn't want to get caught doing something destructive. I hope anyone in the midst of an ED is able to realize this and adjust behavior accordingly. Please be safe and don't waste water. Feels like a weird note to end on but it's pretty relevant so I'm standing by it. Also feel free to PM or something if you don't want to share publicly.\n\n*EDIT 3*: Before anyone asks. Did not have a plunger in this bathroom and definitely did not have time to search the house for one while a third of my upstairs was drenched in my watered down vomit", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

I just need to get some stuff out so sorry if this ends up being a wall of text. I'm lately just realizing I have a problem. \n\nFirst of all, 2 years ago after I finished my degree at a university in a city, I moved back home to a smaller town. In the past two years, I've advanced at my job, got a great boyfriend, adopted a cat &amp; bought a house. So things should be great. But I still find myself struggling. My boyfriend works a lot of night shifts, so I am often home alone in the evenings where all hell often breaks loose. Mostly out of boredom, I end up smoking weed and that leads to binging. I likely have a bit of a dependence on weed as well but that's something else I am trying to come to terms with. \n\nAlso my boyfriend loves to cook and is great at it. Great because he uses delicious ingredients, no diet food around here. So lots of leftovers for me. I often find myself planning what I am going to eat and how to eat the most in the most efficient way. Ugh. Since I finished school I don't have a lot to keep me busy at home, I do like to read but haven't been doing that a lot. So since I have nothing to keep me busy, I eat! And now I know I have gained weight, I actually look back at old photos and like the way I look, now I try to avoid photos. So I am sad and have no self esteem over that, and it turns into me eating! \n\nI am trying to take control over this and take responsibility before I let it get too far, so just posting here instead of lurking feels like a little bit of progress, better than nothing I suppose. I also have subscribed to Brain over Binge podcast.  If anyone has any comments or suggestions about anything I would be appreciative.

I've [23F] been struggling with eating habits and body dysmorphia for a while now. Growing up I was really overweight and suffered a lot of bullying and had always indulged in unhealthy habits like watching models all day and looking up shows about people struggling with ED's. However, because I was still overweight I didn't consider I had any issue. As years passed by I started to lose the weight and became normal, but I was always self conscious about my weight and wouldn't go to the beach, always asked my family if I looked fat from this angle or that angle and thought it was unfair that I was never gonna have a lean stomach and hated my stretch marks and all of that, but I was eating. I still measured and weighed myself, but I was eating. Last year I noticed I was putting weight back on again, and I was terrified, I had been going on diets and workout regimes on and off and always yo-yo dieting and going through restricting and binging phases. But last year I thought I was doing everything right, I was counting calories, I was obsessed I knew the calories in a single grape and in every food by heart, but I thought I was doing fine. And one day I woke up and I didn't eat, and I didn't eat the next day too, and the next one. My family started noticing and I opened up about it, I was in a very dark place, the first thing I ate was half a Starbucks bagel after 3 days and I cried for 1 hour because I didn't want to eat it but I didn't want to die or be sick. I went to a therapist who told me \"you don't have an ED because you're not skinny enough\" and that made me lose more weight. During this time I lost 12 kgs. I started eating again sort of normally after a week, but I know I still don't eat enough. I know I'm not okay still, I still skip meals, I still spit and chew, I still feel terrible if I get even slightly bloated. I still wanna lose more weight. My weight is perfectly normal in theory, it's a healthy weight, but I still don't see it. But I don't know how to get help because people don't classify me as anorexic because I'm not underweight and they don't classify me as bulimic because I don't purge, and without knowing which box to put me in, they don't help me. I still binge and over exercise, but everyone tells me I'm not skinny enough to have an issue and I honestly start to believe it. I'm just a little lost and I'd really appreciate it if any of you could help.

I think it's kind of a vent thing as well so it's probably going to get quite extensive, I'm sorry about that. \n\nTo explain a little, I don't even know if I have an ED myself but I'm quite sure I have big emotional issues tied to my body and food intake. I live with my roomate and her partner, and she has AN and he has pretty bad disordered eating. They know I have issues too (like depression and overall selfdestructive tendencies to say it shortly lmao), but the problem is I feel so uncomfortable and secretive because I don't want to trigger her accidentaly by not eating together or eating smaller portions (while I don't even have the same need as her at all) etc. So I would force myself to eat big ass mf plates because they eat huge meals mainly because they eat once a day, and I love eating with them and being with them but it makes me dread this time so much when I have my meal plan in my head for the day and then I feel so bad saying I don't want to eat what they cooked, or that when I'll say that, I'll accidentaly trigger my roomate into eating less than what she would've ate. And a lot of the time, they eat dinner way after me, so I feel bad saying I REALLY already ate and sometimes I feel obligated to eat again, or I feel hungry for hours waiting for them and feel disgusting because it makes me overeeat. And in the end I trigger myself, and I feel gross. I know the issue here is myself but I don't know what to do. Beacause I struggle with it too, and I don't know how many calories they put in their meals and it makes me want to cry that I'm in such a dilemma all the time. So like when I cook for myself I always do the portion I'm going to eat, but they always make huge portions and I can never resist because I'm not an intuitive eater at all I have a very hard time controlling my food intake when I'm not counting calories, and it becomes a mess when I'm counting calories because I become super obssessive and I can't not know what they cook and it's all a mess and \n\nIt was quite okay for a few months because for depression recovery reasons I stopped monitoring everything as much as I could but know I'm falling back into my obsessive habits again and I don't know how to balance this out. Of course I need to recover from my illnesses etc, but the point is, even if I had a healthy meal plan I probably would feel extremely guilty while following it because of this. I can't even.\n\nLike for example they'd be like \"yeay let's make a pizza together\". I feel gross about it so I want out but if I say so I'm afraid she'll feel gross about it when she's trying her best to eat normally. So I end up spending days on how to counter it or having an excuse to eat something else . And when I legit can't eat something I sometime still eat it (like a plate of carbs just before bed make me kinda sick while it's ok during daytime digestion-related thing idek y) and feel physically (and mentally) awfull. \n\nHonestly this is a huge mess I don't know if you could really understand everything ugh\n\nAm I the only one behaving like this?

I\u2019m a bit uncomfortable posting because my struggle with eating disorders isn\u2019t as \u201cbad\u201d as it used to be but I\u2019m looking for advice about whether or not it is worth me continuing to get treatment (which is expensive as I pay out of my own pocket, and no one aside from my bfriend and sister know I go to). \n\nI\u2019ve struggled with eating disorders since I was in middle school. I primarily had anorexia and BED, and started getting treatment when my parents forced me to get treatment at age 18 because they were worried about me dying (I\u2019m 22 now).  Thankfully treatment went great in the sense that I gained to a healthy weight, which took a very long time. I\u2019ve been a healthy weight for about a year and a half now I think. \n\nIn the past two years I believe I\u2019ve been in what is called \u201cquasi-recovery\u201d but I\u2019m not sure. I feel as if I don\u2019t know what is normal now, even though I eat anywhere between 2,200-3,000 calories a day. My problem is that I struggle with constant guilt surrounding my eating habits since I am at a healthy weight and I have a tendency to eat a lot of sugary and junk foods. \u201cNormal\u201d to me and my family has always been diets, giving up sugar, giving up bread, drinking only smoothies for breakfast, etc. I struggle with the urge to restrict certain foods everyday, because I feel like I am eating too much junk (which I know I am much more than normal people). \n\nSo this is where I\u2019ve been confused. I am a healthy weight (on the low end of healthy), and I don\u2019t restrict foods, and eat more than enough constantly. I treat myself to sweets almost everyday. I just feel like I have no control anymore, and it\u2019s been awful living at home and having to listen to conversations that trigger my orthorexia. If I am not restricting, should I still get help? \n\nI\u2019m honestly mostly worried about gaining more weight than I need to which I know is stupid, but I know that is probably the inevitable outcome of all my eating of unhealthy foods. Should I try to handle this alone, eat healthier, and just fight the thoughts or seek professional help again? I am finding I just have no idea of what balance and maintenance looks like because I\u2019ve had an eating disorder for as long as I can remember. Now that I\u2019m a healthy weight I don\u2019t know how to maintain it without restriction. \n\nThanks everyone.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I don't believe I have an eating disorder but my boyfriend has been yelling at me lately, telling me that I'm anorexic. Other people in my life have also made comments about telling me to eat or trying to get me to eat more.\n\nTo be fair, I was underweight last year but I gained weight back. Last year I was extremely depressed - it was an extremely hard year for me. I stopped taking my thyroid medication and I just slept. I was very underweight, but I don't didn't think I looked that thin. I lost my period and a lot of hair. I gained weight but am still in the underweight BMI range right now, which I feel looks like too much but I was told by my thyroid specialist that I needed to gain weight once I went back on my medication.\n\nI take my medication every day now, so I'm not sick anymore. But I honestly don't eat much just because I feel like I have no time. Plus, I don't get hungry. I try to eat when I'm hungry. I have dinner, and I usually eat a banana, a protein bar or two, and a yogourt cup at work when I have time. I just started this new job and the girl I'm replacing never took breaks so I don't have much time to eat so I try to eat quickly at my desk. I'm a very slow eater, so it's hard for me to do this.\n\nI also have trouble sleeping, so I wake up too late to eat a real meal before work, and when I get home I eat something quick for dinner and sleep because I am so tired. Sometimes I fall asleep when I get home and wake up around midnight so I make food then and go back to sleep if I can. I don't talk to people much anymore either because I'm afraid of them. I think they won't like me, or that I'll get too close to them and then they'll attack me later when they're tired of me. Or I feel like a burden. So I don't eat socially very often, but I do occasionally. Sometimes with coworkers or friends from my hobbies.\n\nAnyway, I'm not trying to lose weight. I just don't have time to eat or I'm too tired to eat. But I don't know. Maybe my behaviour isn't normal - I'm not sure anymore. But I don't want to be yelled at anymore.

It\u2019s not like vaping is an everyday thing for me; I go through phases with it. Sometimes, you just need a little help from a friendly little substance in getting through the tough stuff. Like Thanksgiving. OH MY FUCKING GOSH: Thanksgiving. A holiday completely devoted to food. I love my extended family, but I can\u2019t really be around them on Thanksgiving without sucking down some nicotine every once and a while and doubling up on anxiety meds. Everyone loves to talk, after I have repeatedly asked them not to, about the calories in the pie, how they\u2019re not going to eat anything until dinner to \u201csave up,\u201d the latest diet fad they\u2019re trying, how they\u2019re being so naughty by eating the stuffing, how they recently lost weight but are about to gain it back just by looking at the food because it\u2019s so fattening, or how much discipline they are exercising by not eating. It\u2019s a holiday where it\u2019s acceptable to restrict all day and then binge. That\u2019s what I used to do too. So, every Thanksgiving, I\u2019m terrified that I\u2019ll lose control of myself in the kitchen and have this giant binge. I\u2019m pretty irritable on Thanksgiving, to the point where I\u2019m not really sure if some of my family likes me. But, if they wanted me to be more hospitable, they could, as I have repeatedly asked them, not talk about the damn food so much and keep their diets to themselves. I can\u2019t really put too much blame on my family though because they really are good people and it\u2019s a societal problem. Our society puts so much emphasis on weight loss and having the perfect body when it doesn\u2019t fucking matter. Who cares if you lose five pounds? It\u2019s not like being thinner makes you a better person. Do you want to be 85 years old and look back on your life and say, \u201cwow, I was skinny,\u201d or do you want to look back and say, \u201cwow, I did something important with my life.\u201d I\u2019m working towards the latter, and I\u2019m not there yet.

You have quite the set of legs on you, dear.\u201d\n\nI chuckled nervously and my husband proudly informed her, \u201cYeah, those are the legs of someone who works out 5 days a week.\u201d\n\nThe lady then implied my husband was a hoodlum who should take care of me and not take me to a discount store (which lol??? also the implication that HE takes care of ME and should because I have appealing legs???) Still my husband thought the interaction was hilarious and kept talking about my legs after. I was starting to think maybe my legs are decent even though I think my thighs are just too wide.\n\nWhen I got home, I tried on four pairs of leggings.

I binged on apples recently (12 or so? i lost count) because I reasoned it would at least be \u201chealthier\u201d carbs than processed sugars but I still wanted to purge. And then the fibre afterwards absolutely killed my gut, so much pain and bloating like I was 6 months pregnant.\n\nSo whenever I contemplate bingeing on fruits and veg as a healthy option I think of that experience and I know I find it harder to purge them than processed stuff like cake or biscuits anyway, so I relapse to my usual b/p\u2019s.\n\n\nSometimes if I drink water in one go (not even a lot of water! Like 300mL- it\u2019s terrible but I drink maybe only 500mL pure water each day) then I get nauseous and full and want to purge even that.\n\nWhen I do eat (healthy normal portions with my family), I\u2019ve also been struggling with intense nausea and feeling like there\u2019s so much food in me that I can almost feel it at the back of my throat.\n\n Ironically, my purges have decreased because my gag reflex is dying on me, but the binges are strong as ever, the urge to purge is still there and the nausea is unbearable. \n\nAt this point I feel like I\u2019m falling into BED and not even close to recovery.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

{"post_id": "bda1vg", "created_utc": 1555290304, "title": "Update: I made an appointment", "author": "yaboifreud", "self_text": "[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckeatingdisorders/comments/7v38vh/i_made_an_appointment/)\n\nI posted this over a year ago and /u/Idunnoking asked for an update on that post. I know this is incredibly late but I think it's about time to make an update anyway. A lot has happened in a year. \n\nSo it started with going to my university's health center. I started seeing their physician, dietitian, and a counselor. Things were okay for a while, I was able to make a little bit of headway in my physical recovery but my mental recovery was a different story of course. I loved my counselor despite her not being totally versed in ED's, and she recommended I start going to the university's \"eating and body awareness\" group, so I did. And it was a goddamn mess. \n\nI may have talked about it before but that group was so poorly facilitated and it wasn't long before it devolved into a bunch of girls sitting in a circle bragging about how sick they are/were, even using specific numbers like weight and calories despite the only rule of the group being that you couldn't do so. I stayed in that group till the end though and convinced myself it was my fault for getting triggered and I really wasn't \"sick enough\" to have an eating disorder (spoiler: that was a load of bullshit).\n\nSo I went home for summer, had to stop seeing my counselor, and as expected for a person with zero professional support I relapsed and carried that all the way into the following school year and never made a follow up with anyone I had been seeing until after winter break. I had to see a new counselor and she was helpful on occasion but she ultimately did so much more harm than good for me at that time. She was not well versed in ED's and as kind of a raw nerve in that point of my recovery, she often triggered me so badly with the things she would say. Things were worse than they had ever been and I knew I would need to either get actual, professional, eating disorder treatment or risk getting worse. So I went in for an assessment at a treatment center in my city on a friday and they were adamant about admitting me to php that coming monday. \n\nI, of course, did not think I needed it at all and tried to convince everyone to let me step down to iop ASAP because in my mind I was not ill, mentally or physically, even though I was using behaviors every single day, isolating myself into oblivion, failing my classes, horribly depressed, and orthostatic with painful raynaud's (suddenly cut off circulation and numbness of the hands and feet from the cold) happening every single time I took my coats off indoors or went outside, even in 65\u00ba weather. So I did php for 3 months. That was 6.5 hours a day for 6-7 days a week, each day including two group therapy sessions, 2 meals, and 1 snack. I saw my therapist twice a week and my dietician once a week.  I just stepped down to iop last week and it's significantly less support but I'm managing the transition.  \n\nThings have gotten way better but I'm so far from recovered. I've been struggling especially hard since stepping down. Still, I'm trying really fucking hard to keep my head above water. I know I've made an insane amount of progress though so I'm trying to stay positive and appreciate what's going well for me. Like the fact that I've been in school this entire time! I seriously don't know how I managed at times but I'm so proud of how well I've been doing academically with all of this going on.\n\nSo that's the update I guess. I've been busy and being in treatment is very hard but I've been growing so much from it.\n\nIf anyone in/considering recovery wants to talk or has any questions about treatment at the outpatient, php, or iop level, let me know. I'm an open book and willing to share about any part of this whole experience: talking to parents about it, dealing with weight gain, what we do in treatment, finding motivation, all of it. \n\nIf you've read this far, you're a trooper. I'm so grateful for this community. I really don't know if I would have even decided to recover in the first place if I hadn't found it, you are all amazing.

I was always a normal U.S. 4 after puberty but my best friend was naturally tiny. She looked like a fairy and I was always so jealous of her. Once we started high school we'd attract a lot of the same guys but they always wanted something more serious with her and I was more of a booty call. I finally lost it when we did something crazy in high school (have a threesome with a senior when we were 15 but hey it was high school) and he stopped kissing me about 15 minutes in and looked at my best friend and spent the next hour moaning about how \"tiny\" perfect\" skinny\" she was. I felt and was invisible he even laughed when he left the room and said, \"Oh I forgot you were even here, to begin with\". After my first boyfriend dumped me in the most heart-shattering way possible because I cheated on him that's when I \"decided\" to lose \"some weight\". At first, I decided I wanted to look like my favorite actress (Effy from skins) well it was perfect in my eyes because we were both 5'6 and I'd only have to lose 10 lbs to look like her. Except ten wasn't enough so I started purging everything I ate and lived off diet coke. I was working out five hours a day, but I finally felt confident. People started saying how skinny I looked and they wished they had my body. I had to leave school at 17 and discovered the dark world of drugs....a new form of control they made me feel happy and I was losing weight without trying. But cocaine and other drugs that suppressed my appetite weren't enough to fill the void inside and I turned to heroin. By 18 I was living with my boyfriend and his wealthy family but I had to give up purging my boyfriend wasn't a fan (no shit) but i stayed thin since i spent every penny i owned on heroin to prevent withdrawals. I got clean when I was 19.5 (from opiates) and I was still underweight but confident with my body to some extent. A few months later an old friend showed me how addictive I.V. coke was and within months I could fit into toddlers clothes....I was finally actually pleased with myself but my twisted mind was only worried about how people no longer said I looked great they said they were concerned, that I had \"such a beautiful figure I could be on sports illustrated but now I looked sickly\" I was no longer able to support my unhealthy habits and with college I didn't have enough time to workout 5 hours a day. I didn't gain too much weight, but every time someone said I looked healthy I wanted to cry. A year ago my boyfriend turned 21 and began drinking heavily and I started having surgery drinks every night too. Now its become a ritual where I have to have a drink before bed otherwise \"I can't sleep\". It's almost as if 8 months of drinking has just now started showing up. I'm losing my mind, I don't know how to make this weight gain stop! I've tried healthy options but I'm at a loss. I haven't been going out to see friends and yesterday something with a guy I'm fwb who I haven't seen in 2 years. The last time he saw me i was 5'6 112 lbs now im 5'6 121 lbs I know it doesn't seem drastic but i kept talking about how I fat I was the entire 24 hours we spent together. I'm so upset because I feel like I ruined another relationship due to my ED. The worst part was the fact that in the past we were both just as skinny (he's lank and 5'11 and has also been much narrower than me i have wide hips but that was an issue before last night. While we were intimate i couldn't stop thinking about how this guy is skinnier than ME and how he was able to be attracted to me and couldn't just tell me to leave since he's a nice guy. I also felt like because our proportions were off the sex was bad and to make matters worse he declined a fourth round which made me feel like it was definitely my weight not that he just pulled an all-nighter so i obsessed about my weight more and even made up a lie that i had gone to theER that week and it was fluids from an IV that's why I looked \"puffy\" he said I looked gorgeous as usual but I couldnt leave it at that I had to say things like \"ugh i wish i looked better for you after all this time\" or draw attention to problem areas and i think I really annoyed him when I kept saying \"I'm not gonna see you again until i lose this water weight.\" I just want to feel comfortable in my own skin and stop drinking since its not healthy sugars to begin with! Thanks for letting me share\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. when i was on top during sex i told him i was afraid id crush him and he just said he recently lost a bunch of weight for from being sick thats why he was so skinny and that i was hurting him ....his reply kinda hurt any ideas why?", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

During  these years I received many kind of professional help which was mainly useless. After years of therapy and daily practicing all kind of coping techniques I still felt constantly hungry and had very strong and debilitating urges to binge/throw up.\n\nThen, couple of months ago, I've been prescribed with ADHD (I have ADHD too) medication (methylphenidate).

The bulling and eventual abuse that happened in 5th grade and the following 6-8th grades were nothing less of traumatic and when my weight spiked by nearly 200 pounds. I'll spare the details of my middle school years for it goes into NSFW territory and don't wanna trigger people who had a history of abuse be it mental, physical, sexual, etc.   \nMy high school years was when my eating was really warped into a strict diet of eating 500 calories and below and trying to exercise or not give a fuck, eating all I can and just binge.

I am an 18 year old female, and I've had a bad relationship with food for a long time. It always came in waves- some months I'd be able to eat fine, then I can't stand food for a few weeks. Because it was so inconsistent, I didn't think it was a disorder. After all, I was under the impression that I was just being picky and could eat if I forced myself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lost 10kg in a year. I've never been one concerned with my body image- I was fine being a little chubby and now I'm fine being a little small. I don't count calories, I'm not obsessed with my weight and don't hate my body. But this past week has worried me. I haven't eaten a real meal in 8 days. Every time I eat something, I throw it up. And if  I don't throw it up naturally, I make myself throw up because I feel so uncomfortable with the food in my stomach, it hurts and makes it feel all groggy and murky. I had a cold the past week too, so I chalked it up to me just losing my appetite because I'm sick. But then I realized how little I've eaten this past week- I've eaten almost nothing. And I can't make myself eat either. My mom is worried for me and says I'm becoming anorexic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't want to ruin myself. So I want to know what to do. Do I force myself to eat? Do I find appetite-inducing medication? I'm going to try and find a doctor. What doctor do I go to? A dietician? A therapist/psychiatrist?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't believe this is because of stress, but it might be. My finals are coming up in a month and at this rate, I will fail. I have no energy and no nutrients in me. I'm finding it hard to concentrate, hard to move and hard to breathe. This could also be because I'm anemic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have any advice, please feel free to share. I thought that coming to a subreddit of people who may have suffered or are suffering of an eating disorder will help. I don't want this to escalate further, and I want to get whatever help I need. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

Not ideal IMO. Lots of people in the threads have either changed their username or simply stopped using the app which means there\u2019s a lot of trial and error for little pay off.\n\nMy idea is to make a little web app and companion bot for Peach. Once you add the bot, your Peach username will be added to the list. \n\nThis method has several advantages. Firstly, it\u2019s all centralized so we wouldn\u2019t have our lists spread across ten different threads you have to dig through. Secondly, by adding the bot as a friend the webpage can stay up to date even if you change your @username because Peach uses special constant identifiers which can be stored internally. Third, and probably most useful, is that it would let me address the issue of dead and abandoned accounts so that you don\u2019t need to send 20 friend requests before finding people that actually use the app. I was thinking I could solve this by having the bot continuously count up the number of posts made in the last week and then push the accounts with greatest number of recent posts to the top of the list. \n\nIn terms of privacy, I was planning on making pretty much everything opt-in and configurable through the Peach chat feature. By default, the webpage will only show your @username and the number of posts made in the last week. If you want to include your display name, bio, or profile picture you\u2019d need to send a chat message and ask the bot to turn it on or off. Additionally, if you want to link your reddit account and have your Peach username in your flair on this sub you would also be able to configure that through chat. Finally, if you\u2019d like to remove yourself you\u2019d be able to do so by sending the bot a message telling it to piss of.\n\nThat\u2019s the basic plan, anyways. **If anyone has any thoughts or concerns (privacy, features, or just general laments) PLEASE let me know!** This site is meant to help this community and if it doesn\u2019t do that it\u2019s sort of pointless so all feedback is appreciated!!", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

On a more philosophical level, it suggests that women who face injustice have much to teach about faith and resistance, trauma and coping, creativity and despair.\" \n\n**On bulimia and incarceration:** \"...many incarcerated women are bulimic. Other prison activists have also noted the widespread use of laxatives among women in prison. Prison policy supports the development of eating problems. Healthy food is rarely available; the meals are high in fat and starch, which makes it difficult not to gain weight. Because of severe restrictions on freedom of movement, the act of eating takes on an importance that makes incarcerated women vulnerable to bingeing.\"\n\n**On traditional forms of treatment:** \"The biomedical model offers important scientific research about possible physiological causes of eating problems and the physiological dangers of purging and starvation. However, this model adopts medical treatment strategies that may disempower and traumatize women, and it ignores many historical and cultural factors that influence women's eating patterns.\" \n\n**On sex-segregated work and barriers to economic independence:** \"In this context, eating problems signal women's many hungers -- for recognition, achievement, and encouragement. It is no surprise that appetites and food take on metaphorical significance  in a society in which women typically are responsible for food preparation and yet are taught to deny themselves ample appetites; girls are taught that the barriers they face are their own fault and therefore require individual solutions; and female socialization means caring for others, often at one's own expense.\"\n\n**On the word \"disorder\":** \"Feminists have also spearheaded research on the connections between eating problems and sexual abuse. In doing so, they have laid the foundation for understanding other traumatic origins of many eating problems. Portraying them as individual 'disorders' rather than responses to physical and psychological distress is part of a historical tendency to mislabel the results of social injustices as individual pathologies.\"\n\n**On sexist understandings of EDs:** \"One blatant example of sexism is the notion that women's foremost worries are about their appearance -- a belittling stereotype that masks women's worries about paying the bills, keeping their children off the streets and in school, and building loving and egalitarian relationships. By highlighting the emphasis on slenderness, the dominant imagery about eating problems falls into the same trap of assuming that difficulties about eating reflect women's 'obsession' with appearance. This misnaming fails to account for the often creative and ingenious ways that girls and women cope with multiple hardships, quite frequently with no one's help but their own.\" \n\n\"By questioning the prominence of the culture-of-thinness model, I do not want to suggest that women avoid talking about their desires to be thin. Issues of appearance are essential currency for women's access to power in this country, and thinness is a critical component. While fat men are vulnerable to ridicule and discrimination, the standards are clearly gendered: being a fat woman is a far graver 'mistake'...\"\n\n**On the taboo:** \"It is hard to imagine what the world might be like if people were able to talk about trauma and the ways they cope with it with the same ease as they talk about dissatisfaction with their weight and appearance...Certain violations of the social contract are too terrible to utter aloud: this is the meaning of the word unspeakable. For a staggering number of women, atrocities done to them are rendered unspeakable. In place of this uttered language are symbolic representations of their traumas--often manifested in unwanted eating patterns and supreme dissatisfaction with appetites and bodies.\"\n\n**On EDs and working-class women:** \"Class stratification also shapes body consciousness. Poverty, for example, can significantly alter a woman's relationship to her body. Being denied a chance to own a car, a house, or even furniture can make a poor women feel as if her body is all she has left.\" \n\n\"The depiction of middle-class women as vain and obsessive is intimately linked to the assumption that working class women are the opposite: one step away from being hungry, ugly, and therefore not susceptible to eating problems. The dichotomy drawn between working-class and middle-class women reflects the biased notion that middle-class people create symbolic, abstract relationships through their actions and thought while working-class people relate to the world in literal, concrete ways. Within this framework, middle- and upper-class women's eating patterns are imbued with all kinds of symbolic significance -- as a way of rebelling against parents, striving for perfection, and responding to conflicting gender expectations. The logic that working-class women are exempt from eating problems, by contrast, strips away any possible symbolic significance or emotional sustenance that food might have or give in their lives. Recognizing that women may develop eating problems to cope with poverty challenges the notion that eating problems are class bound and confirms that both middle- and working-class women are quite capable of creating sophisticated and symbolic relations with food that go far beyond a biological need for calories.\" \n\n**On body consciousness:** \"Women's ways of using food are emblematic of a rupturing of women's embodiment, of their ability to see themselves as grounded in and connected to their bodies. When I first began to ask women about their relationships to their bodies, I asked them to tell me about their body images, but I soon realized a basic conceptual problem in my question. By inquiring about their body 'image' I was taking for granted that they imagined themselves as having bodies, an assumption that many women quickly dispelled.\"\n\n\"Unlike the term 'image,' which has a psychological, individual connotation, the etymology of 'consciouness' links an awareness of one's social standing directly to social conditions. Consciousness, as Karl Marx used the term, links individual people's social realities, opportunities, and perspectives to class. In a similar way, one's body consciousness is linked to one's race, gender, and sexuality. This connection more accurately captures women's complicated relationship to their bodies than is conveyed in the term 'image.'\"\n\n\"But body consciousness occurs at the imaginative and symbolic level as well. In the face of debilitating stereotypes and injustices, women do struggle to claim their bodies as their own. The struggle requires being able to see one's own image of one's body, rather than the images projected onto it. Consciousness both takes into account oppressive perceptions of the body and rejects what is debilitating about them.\"", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I'm 34 now, just for the record. English isn't my first language so please bear with me.\n\nI got sick when I was around 17-18 years old. Went into treatment (both OP/IP) in my early twenties after trying to please the people who loves me. I didn't really recover but I wasn't actively sick. The self harm took a different form and the eating disorder took the back seat for a while, since I was too busy being a drug/alcohol addict. I got clean when I was 24 and have been since. But after about a year after getting clean the ED showed its ugly face again. I relapsed and seeked out treatment on my own (with the support from loved ones). After treatment I also went to another therapist to really get to the bottom of all of my underlying issues (sexual abuse/rape/etc). I did recover, I'm at a healthy weight and I exercise regularly in a non-compensatory way. So I did recover, but can you ever really recover?\n\nI've had a couple of bad things happen in my life and it seems like, every time some shit happens, I just naturally stop eating. It's like food becomes excessive. And I'm fully aware of it. I start to lose weight and once I start to lose weight, things get weird. The eating disorder is triggered and I have to struggle again with eating normally.\n\nSo in December my mom was diagnosed with cancer. We have a very close bond and I love her beyond words. She had a massive stroke about 10 years back and is still disabled from this. I just feel like her getting cancer is the most unfair thing in the world. I know life's unfair, yada yada, but still. And as icing on the cake, a couple of months later my grandmother passed away.\n\nAnd now I've lost about 9 kilos since the end of December. And the eating disorder is SCREAMING at me from the top of its lungs to just slide back in to its comforting arms.\n\nI know it's all about control for me. It has always been. Feeling like I'm in control of something when everything else feels out of control. And usually I try to fight it. Remind myself that the ED will lead to a loss of control in the long run. And the loss of everything that matters to me - relationships, weightlifting, work, living a full life and enjoying everything it has to offer. \n\nBut this time something is different. I kind of want to go back. I kind of want to be sick again. I've been actively trying to lose more weight. And it's so very stressful, just trying to keep this a secret from my boyfriend and family and friends. I'm still at a healthy weight. I could even lose a bit more without it being anything harmful. But I know my thoughts and behaviours are bad. And I don't feel like I can talk to anyone about it, because if I do, the secret is out and I will have to change my behaviour and get back on the recovery wagon.\n\nI just feel so lost in all of this.

What is more worrying is that there seems to be a lack of awareness about the damaging effect dieting can have on someone with BED. I\u2019ve spoken before about how difficult it was for me to stop dieting, so I\u2019m in no way trivialising how difficult it is to do. It\u2019s hard. But I\u2019m really sad to read the same thing over and over. \u201cI was dieting for x weeks and doing well and lost weight and now I\u2019m uncontrollably binging, depressed and need help to stop\u201d if you suffer from BED the ONLY thing dieting will do is push you into a binge cycle. It seems obvious to me now but I remember that wasn\u2019t always the case and the thought of stopping dieting scared the hell out of me. But when I stopped that behaviour, ate at maintenance and took healthy exercise my weight dropped, stabilised to a healthy point and has stuck that way for 2 years. The longest it has ever been like that. There is no way my relationship with food is miraculously fixed. I regularly overeat probably once a week. But I\u2019m in control and plan what I eat and it\u2019s comparatively easy to eat pretty much normally the rest of the time with no psychological or physical effects. The problem is always there and I\u2019m aware it wouldn\u2019t take much to push me back to the old ways, but I know 100% dieting would do it rapidly and I\u2019d fall hard. My advice if you really think you need to lose weight through consistent restriction is to be extremely careful (in reality you will probably lose more weight in a sustainable way by eating at maintenance and the positive effect that will have on binge frequency). If you can\u2019t let dieting go, at least try to manage how you restrict. Only restrict 200cals below your maintenance and only do it for 6 week intervals maximum (even that is pushing it). Then reassess your maintenance needs, eat at maintenance for 6 weeks and then see how you feel. If you really want more risk of self punishment by weighing yourself (personally I\u2019m never setting foot on a scale again) then only do it once a week, at the same time when you first wake up and after you\u2019ve used the bathroom. \n\nPlease stop punishing your bodies by restricting calories. It will only ever end up making you feel terrible.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I mean like awesome for her to keep at healthy levels, but like she lost weight in a healthy way over a healthy time period while regularly consulting with her doctors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis just seems really different than restricting to &lt;500 calories a day, weighting yourself multiple times a day and not being able to come to terms with the fact that the number on the scale is moving down but you're still a horrible blubbery flab monster. But like that might just be me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut that im a gate keeping asshole. What do you think the threshold for having anorexia is? What would you consider the minimum standard for disordered eating?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited to remove link.\n\nSecond edit:     Because no one has answered the question but the justification keeps coming up\n\n. If anorexia is a mental condition that has to do with mental state rather than physical or behavioral. Can over weight and obese people be considered anorexic if they have the mental state of it without the behaviors or physical attributes?  \n\nIf yes, do you think being more inclusive to those that are suffering but are unable to clearly identify with the group due to weight stigma should receive the same level of treatment as those suffering who happen to have the 'typical' side effects? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat ways would you prioritize patient care to a group of 10 people where only 5 can get treatment due to available financing while being mindful of the fact that mental suffering is still mental suffering with the same disorder between all of them . you have 3 patients in BMI 14-16 range that don't want treatment. You have 3 patients in BMI 22 -24range that want to kill themselves. you have 3 patients with BMI 32-35 who are desperate for treatment because of serious impacts on their life.  you have 1 patient who is BMI 18 and is displaying signs of self abuse but is insistent they are getting better.\n\n5 get in who is it? All patients admitted receive the same schedule, meals, activity choices.\n\nBonus round. The same clinic wanting to support progressive and inclusive plans of care will no longer use BMI as a measurement or point of admission. You are given 10 potential patients. 4 want to do the bare minimum for treatment and be done.  3 want nothing to do with the place as it makes their disorder worse being around so many other people with the same issues. 3 want to do treatment because of personal gains for successful completion. 3 are indifferent and do not thing the program will stop them from killing themselves.  Pick 5 for who gets treatment \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote the 2 above examples are exaggerated and satirical. But exchange anorexia patients with PTSD soldiers who are now competing for resources with suburban women who had a bad experience at the grocery store or get stressed over social parties. Exchange it for immigrant families who are coming into the country from a war torn country with immigrant families who are moving here from the UK and have assimilated or have easier times assimilating.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I got on the scale this morning after two days of binging which I know I shouldn't have done because a., I have an eating disorder, and b., my weight has fluctuated up to 16 pounds over the course of a week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut uh...I got on the scale, saw that I was .2 pounds from that target weight that I said \"that's funny, yeah not happening keep dreaming\" way-back-when, and was okay with it. Then I got dressed. And it was okay. I didn't panic. It was fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have class in seven minutes and I can't leave my bed. I took my Vyvanse, a bronkaid, and drank something with 300 mg of caffeine, and I can't leave my bed. I don't want to leave my room. I was so focused on getting better but I just want to be left alone with my eating disorder. I want to be left alone with my eating disorder and I want it to kill me. I've been pushing everyone away, slowly. Not the \"I wonder what's wrong with u/Drichthy, we should check on her,\" oh no, I'm making sure they see me as a crap person. I'm hurting everyone now so I don't have to hurt anyone later. I'm going back to that girl who laughed in her mother's face when she worried she would die because of how sick she was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI look healthy now. I feel healthy. I post motivational things on my Instagram account, I followed everyone I could find from my old treatment center, I really thought I could fake it until I somehow got better. But I just can't. Coming to school was supposed to replace the eating disorder. Instead, I  adjusted my schedule to accommodate my eating disorder.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI spent more time weighing my food and performing caloric calculations than I did on any of my mathematics homework.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have my parents and my therapist convinced that I'm doing just *fantastic,* I'm not even being sent to a treatment center this summer as they originally planned. I tell them how much I adore having my curves back, how much more energy I have, how much happier I feel. But I don't. I realize when I was 86 pounds that I was slowly on my way out. My toes were turning purple. Everything just hurt. And it was nice. I didn't have the mental capacity to care about anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I've set everything up so that if this does kill me, my parents won't see it as me giving up. It'll just be a shame that I wasn't strong enough to fight this. I tried. But just couldn't. That's the image I'll let them have and that'll help them cope.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI used to be a person with a personality. I was articulate and I went to class and I took AP classes, and oh gosh, I loved animals. I love animals still, but it's just that. I don't do anything with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI briefly \"dated\" someone, or rather, we were friends, and I suggested we try and make things a bit more official. I remember him telling me that he'd like me to stop making \"shelf life\" jokes. I thought that was odd, I couldn't really understand what the issue was. But of course it makes sense, who the hell wants to hear someone they care about not-so-jokingly make comments about how they aren't going to last very long?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe got invested and I couldn't keep toying with him knowing I'll probably never get better. And I keep on telling him to stop worrying, to stop caring, and he just won't. So I'm just acting as though I'm cold, bitter, and I never really felt any emotional investment. I thought that would make him stop caring. He told me he didn't want to start something with someone who was just going to slowly kill themselves and I understood that. Then apparently I had him convinced that I would change. But I'm not. I won't, and I can't. So I ended things...and he was upset by it. Because he liked me. And he cared.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's a girl in my dorm who's lovely, but has the reputation of being a bit annoying. The more time you spend with her, the more you realize she's a good person, and just sometimes needs someone to listen to her. But a lot of people dislike her. He told me \"if you weren't a good person, you wouldn't be friends with her.\" You know how I replied? I said I'm not friends with her, I can't stand her. I only spend time with her because I pity her and feel some cosmic obligation to spend time with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd she used to send me texts quite often and call, and I did the same. I haven't heard from her in a while so I'm guessing a little birdie repeated what I said. I suppose that's for the best. I don't want anyone to have anything to miss. Everyone cared so much and was so kind to me, but it just isn't working.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm going to a family session today, and I'm going to lie about how I went to all my classes today, how happy I am, how I definitely do not need to go to a treatment center. How much I love having my figure back. How much better I've been coping with the binge-eating episodes. How I don't have a note buried in my backpack in case I drop dead from a heart attack due to all the medications I keep mixing together.

My definition of that simply means you feel like you have one foot placed in a binge free life and the other in your reoccurring old habits you're working hard on releasing*. \n\nI noticed for me the more time and energy I used towards all things binge eating; research, reading subs, YouTube, podcasts etc, the harder it was to detach myself from thinking about binge eating and food I'm general. The more I kept it \"alive\" the more space it took up in my mental RAM. By researching and learning about binge eating the goal was to reduce the space it took in my world but instead J unknowingly was the architect of my own frustration. The allure to keep learning was in efforts to find the \"new insight\" that'll change everything and make sense of all of binge eating but a new insight would come and I would eventually self sabotage over and over. So many moments I've thought \"I've finally found the realization that'll stop me from binge eating\". It'll blow my mind and I'll go without binging until I ultimately would slip up. \n\nI'm drifting off topic somewhat but my main point is simply to forget becoming a philosopher of binge eating and nutrition and take action. You don't need to know every single detail to not engage in the habit. It can be a hindrance and worst it makes you feel like you're doing something righteous but in the background you're really just getting stimulating by new binge eating information and creating another wicked habit you need to break. The mind loves your dopamine spikes in whatever way possible. \n\nThis isn't to say if you stop consuming binge eating content you'll stop binge eating/overeating. You probably won't as you already know it's a gradual process which starts with the frequency of binging/overeating being ever more infrequent. Or maybe this thinking never completely goes away, who actually knows. But instead of desiring perfection and an end goal, these days I'm choosing to live in the present. The past doesn't exist and neither does the future, all we have is right now. One thing consuming less content will do is drastically reduce the real estate binge eating has in your mind. That is the goal after all. If you're not constantly thinking about disordered eating/thinking what's stopping you from behaving normally around food when you have peace of mind? \n\nFor me personally I notice when I'm overthinking about eating I'm in the red zone. It's not a good place to be in. My goal is for my eating experience to be effortless, sensible and spontaneous not quadratic equations. I know inately &amp; surface level mentally what a decent meal looks like to satisfy my needs in any one particular moment, I shouldn't have to dwell, ponder and mediate on that decision making process for a lengthy amount of time. Eating is eating. Thinking is thinking. Don't merge the two together the same way you don't overthink drinking water or bathing for that matter. It's a habit to cultivate but like you've shown your supreme ability to master habits (binge eating), you can master the right habit's. Repetition deepens the impression..\n\nThis was inspired by I post I read here talking about whether or not this community is helpful to them. I think it can be both helpful and harmful. Just be mindful enough to know when it's being detrimental. \n\nAnother thing is I feel most quasi-recovery folk are here to help spread the gospel of what worked for them. I know this because I do this occasionally but! Again it can lead to a trap if you live in that space. It will begin to dominate your thoughts then have the adverse effect on you and your journey. I never wanted to be a disciple of binge eating, that's not what I started this journey for. I started to this journey to rebalance my relationship with food and my mind. That remains the number 1 priority so sometimes it will take me sacrificing helping others over me helping myself but I know this community is very efficient and I take comfort in knowing no one spoon fed me the things I've come to know. I wanted to know what a healthy mindset around food was bad enough.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I thought you guys would be my best resource for advice or info about this. TW if you do not want to read general mentions of weight/restriction/etc- I make several references for background info, but I will make sure not to include any numbers other than units of time.\n\nI am looking to \u2018donate\u2019 plasma soon, both because it will really help people who are seriously sick and also because it pays a LOT for very little time and effort and can be done frequently. However, I\u2019m concerned about whether I\u2019ll be okay if I do or if I\u2019m going to have some insurmountable health issues because of it. \n\nAfter being totally weight restored for many months, I have (unfortunately) recently returned to high restricting and my weight has been lessening over the past month+ (if relevant for background info, I have also been vegan for ~1.5 months, and I started taking b complex and iron as of this week). Currently, I am still considered to be in the \u2018*normal*\u2019 weight range for my height, not underweight. I am also well above the minimum weight required by the plasma center to donate.\n\nI read while researching that donating plasma burns calories- even though it\u2019s less than those burned donating *blood*- so should I be eating at least a certain amount on donation days to compensate so that I don\u2019t pass out? Will I be able to properly regenerate plasma if I\u2019m still heavily restricting or will I get really ill? Etc. Have any of you donated plasma during low weight/restriction or know anything about it in the context of an anorexic\u2019s situation from a doctor\u2019s standpoint?

To compensate I would attempt to fast completely the next day and if successful on the first day continue for a second day, all while going on the treadmill at max inclination for 2-4 hours a day to try to compensate for all the calories in addition to 1-2 hours of weightlifting. I never purged but I sure did try several times but the combination of physical and mental pain it caused from trying always made me come to tears before anything came up, which in some ways at the time made me even more sad because I knew I\u2019d gain more weight from whatever everything being kept down. On top of that I am celiac and at some points I would purposefully have items with gluten in it because I felt like it might make me throw up (never really did) and hoped the pain it caused to my stomach might make me want to eat less. All while knowing I was damaging my body even more than if I just binged on gluten free foods. \n\nOver time I stopped eating foods with gluten, then stopped attempting to purge, then stopped trying to kill myself at the gym, and while I did binge 4 times in the past week and a half, they were only ~1800-2800 calories.\n\nSo I\u2019m proud of myself for at least stopping some of the harmful things I\u2019d do to myself and being able to lower the amount I eat on binges :).

With this comes many fun little celebrations that include food. I restrict my calories to 300-800/ day and I usually don\u2019t eat until 8pm or later. I made it through a lunch for my bridal shower okay, although I was afraid to eat early on in the day. I have a bachelorette party coming up that will include my friends bringing over lunch, a sushi dinner, and lots of beer. I\u2019ve got night-before plans that includes take out and drinks. I\u2019ve got a reception at a brewery with a taco buffet and a day after brunch with my in-laws. Then the really scary part comes in. After my wedding day I\u2019m going on a TWO WEEK honeymoon where I will have to eat out 2-3 times a day. Every day! And if I\u2019m too obvious about cutting calories I\u2019m going to be fighting with my new husband days into our marriage!!\n\nI\u2019m so scared guys. I\u2019m excited about all this, I really am.

I\u2019m scared of causing a scene by trying to avoid food. I\u2019m scared of weight gain and gastroperisis and not fitting into my swimsuit on my trip. I\u2019m scared that two weeks will ignite a binge cycle I can\u2019t get past.

I used to dance, and it was terrible being a fat ballerina. Every competition I entered i was painfully aware of how much bigger i was than all the other dancers and every judge, dance teacher, entitled dance mom, and dancer acknowledged my weight in one way or another. I practically lived in the same black hoodie and sweatpants in my early teens (about 12-14yo) and always hated the way my body looked. The first time i saw the stretch marks on my thighs i sobbed and thought that no one would ever find this attractive. At 16 my best friend died, my other half, my soulmate. This made it so hard to even consider eating anything due to guilt of thinking i should have died and not her, so i lived on iced coffee and baby carrots for about two years (16-17yo). When junior prom came around, i thought that it would be a great idea to buy a gorgeous ball gown online, but was terribly mistaken when i tried it on and it couldn\u2019t zip all the way. I went on a \u201cdiet\u201d and lost about 10 pounds in a week or so. I still remember eating a head of lettuce like an apple one day after school because i was so hungry and defeated. When o would go out with my parents for dinner, i would always eat a lot and excuse myself to the bathroom to make myself sick. I finally realized i had a problem when i had the perfect method to make myself sick, and realized i had to gain control. Fast forward a couple years, and it seemed to get pushed to the back of my mind because of depression and anxiety and all that really fun mental shit that makes you want to die almost every day, but even if my ED wasn\u2019t always on my mind, i knew it was still there and i had to fight it. Recently i\u2019ve been dating the love of my life, and honestly plan on marrying him some day. I live at his house with his mom and step dad (type person? i honestly don\u2019t know how to describe him he\u2019s an asshole but they\u2019ve been together for 10 years so common law i guess?). My BF is terribly skinny, all 5 of his siblings are. He wants to gain weight and muscle so we started going to the gym more and trying to eat healthy but it isn\u2019t the healthiest thing for me and tonight i finally realized this when i ate a slice of pizza at work and felt so guilty I stayed on the elliptical for 70 minutes and burned more calories than i\u2019ve even taken in today. I don\u2019t know, i\u2019m trying to get more control and fight this ED and i don\u2019t even know how to classify my ED if it\u2019s bulimia or anorexia or what but all i know is i\u2019m struggling.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

Below is a list of things I've lost because of it and chronic  issues I have as a result:\n\nInsomnia (I either don't sleep at all without meds, sleep 3 hours and then can't sleep any more, or have nightmares. I've had this for *11* years).\n\nSevere trust issues (Most people don't understand ed's, especially your closest friends and family, but it becomes your world, so when something inevitably happens as a result of your ed, they won't understand, you will be hurt and trust in anyone will die).\n\nDamaged teeth, oesophagus (purging for 17 years means my teeth are awful, they crack and break easily and I've had a few removed due to the constant stomach acid rinsing over them plus my throat is scarred from all the vomiting).\n\nLoneliness (Fear of people finding out meant that I chose to live alone for over a decade and when my 'friends' saw the dark side of my ed, they turned on me, so now I'm alone a lot because I don't trust anyone).\n\nObsession (I don't have OCD but I do obsess about everything as a result of my need for control stemming  from my ed).\n\nNarcissism (I used to be a people person. I absolutely love kids, but planning life around an ed all the time means you think about yourself more than anyone else, it makes you selfish).\n\nDepression and anxiety (go hand in hand with ed's after all when you feel like your life is controlled by ed's and you feel like everything will fall apart if you don't throw up that binge, it's easy for D&amp;A to take over).\n\nSelf hate (I thought I'd love myself more with it, I thought it would help me lose weight and be who I wanted to be but I hate myself more than anyone ever could, I feel like a bad person all the time and all I see in the mirror is the monster I was trying to escape from. I have very little hope in anyone loving and starting a family with me because I can't stand myself, how could anyone else?).\n\nPoverty (I have a pretty good income yet I easily spend \u00a3100-200 a week on food that ends up in the toilet meaning I save nothing and am poorer than I have any right to be).\n\nIf I knew as a child, contemplating that first vomit, that  this would be my life as a nearly 31 year old, I'd have run screaming from the monster under the bed instead of making friends with it.\n\nIf only I could see that the sheep was really a fox.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

A significant amount over the 6 months between just before Christmas &amp; now. I'm okay with it. The world didn't end, I didn't balloon, I bought new clothes. In fact, I recommend drawstring elasticated waist jeans. They look like regular jeans but the waist is stretchy &amp; adjustable so the jeans \"grow with you\". Amazingly \"not growing out\" of my jeans has changed my panic into being okay with the weight gain. I can justify that I still fit my clothes. A small victory but helpful to me nonetheless.\n\nI have stopped purging. I don't binge as much. I actually crave salad/leafy greens a lot more - I assume for the iron as I am iron deficient/anaemic. My food choices seem to have naturally balanced. I eat a variety of pretty much everything.\n\nI no longer count calories or weigh myself or my food. I am going purely off of how I feel. Bloating is still ever present but appears to be subsiding somewhat &amp; my new budding breasts aren't bothering me anywhere near as much as they were.. I am yet to wear a bra though. That still frightens me.\n\nMy bum has more padding. This is an excellent thing &amp; my way to rationalise it &amp; calm myself about it is - I can now sit on our wood floor &amp; play with my daughter without my trusty donut pillow! I can just sit down where ever we happen to be &amp; play. We have been getting to the local park as the weather has been pleasant &amp; I had the energy to spin her on the roubdabout, push her on the swing, help her up the steps of the slide.\n\nMy 3 year old put it better than I ever could, the other day she looked at me while we were eating dinner. I finally had a larger portion than she did. \"Mummy, you're eating! You happy now. I happy too\". It just about brought tears. The fact that she didn't think I was happy, that she knew all along however I tried to hide it. She feeds me now, she likes to share her snacks &amp; instead of freaking out it hasn't been weighed &amp; inputted into a daily total I can now eat her puff or her chocolate raisin or date or raspberry or *anything* &amp; can share off of my own plate too. It doesn't matter anymore. She is so much more important than any calorie.\n\nThis is life &amp; I feel I am finally living it. I don't know what exactly changed. Maybe it was feeling I've missed out on my daughter's babyhood &amp; young childhood by being stuck in my own misery. But she didn't deserve that &amp; nor did I. I am no longer distant Mummy. I am engaged with our play, I take part, I even made a Mum friend from her nursery! \n\nSure, some days I'm wobbly &amp; I still can't look down in the shower much...but the trade off is worse. I can be very thin &amp; \"confident\" in my self control...or I can throw that out the window, think of my body as a vehicle for who I am, disregard it, &amp; live the life I want to live.\n\nHappy Easter everyone. There is an Easter egg with my name on it in the cupboard in my kitchen. After lunch I'm going to have some. It doesn't matter how much, just as much as I fancy. I'm not going to pre portion it for weeks to come, I'm not going to weigh it. For the first time in maybe 16 years I'm just going to crack it open &amp; eat it as I please. Wishing all who celebrate a lovely day, a strong day, a happy day :)\n\nAs my daughter in her 3 years of wisdom says - You're eating, you're happy now.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

You can hit all the criteria. Except, critically, the feeling. The state of feeling thin. Of feeling what you associate thinness with: the opposite of fatness.  It is the opposite of being fat, and so it has to feel like the opposite of feeling fat. \n\nTo feel fat does not necessitate an overweight body. To feel thin does not necessitate a normal or underweight one. There are values assigned to these concepts. What should be natural, mechanical, unthinking - the state of just simply being, is shot through with ingrained threads of vice and virtue. Is is not enough to be something, you must also exhibit and embody the concepts associated with it. Convincing yourself that you\u2019ve managed to do so is probably the hardest part. \n\nIt\u2019s the pursuit of an impossible feeling. An internal satiation achieved through external deprivation. Contradictory. Hypocritical. The embodiment of a feeling we can\u2019t even put to words beyond the devastatingly insufficient \u2018thin\u2019 or \u2018fat.\u2019\n\nAnnnnnnnd I\u2019m not gonna read back over uh,,,,, whatever the hell this is. I\u2019m tired, but when am I not tired? Why is being alive this exhausting? \n\nThis post is brought to you by: Me, a person who had a really fun day but ate things that don\u2019t feel safe including but not limited to a mini jam donut, a chicken burger, and half one of those Lindt gold chocolate rabbits. It\u2019s not even that much. I don\u2019t feel overfull. I just don\u2019t like myself.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I have done so by avoiding triggering foods and closely monitoring what I do consume.\n\nYesterday was terrifying for me. I always binge at family functions because there's so many delicious options. However, I knew if I brought my own food and ONLY ate that (no \"little tastes\" of anything else) I would be ok. \n\nIt worked, but unfortunately, I looked like a weirdo for bringing my own food and really hurt the feelings of my aunt who made me a special pesto pasta salad. I really did want to have some of the salad, but I knew I wouldn't stop at just some salad. I would eat and eat and eat until I was sick. \n\nI tried to explain in person the best I could but just fumbled with my words. I sent this message to her this morning and hope it makes her feel better. I feel awful but I knew I had to stay strong to stay binge-free. \n\n\"Hi Aunt _____. I wanted to say thank you so much for thinking of me when you made the salad. It sounded so good.\n\nI've been fighting with binge eating disorder for many months now and like an alcoholic with alcohol, have had to cut out many foods that triggered binges.\n\nFor a long time I was eating up to 10,000 calories a day getting so sick that I would sometimes use suppositories to clear out my system so I could eat more. I had no control. \n\nFor over a month now, I have been binge-free but it has come at a cost. I can't eat many things for fear of losing control, and I have to weigh out what I do eat to the gram. I know it won't always be like this, but for now, I'm just going through the motions to make it through. \n\nYesterday was hard. I was around all these delicious foods but I knew if I ate anything outside of what I brought, I wouldn't stop. At the last family event, I packed in as much food as I could and went on a week-long binge after. It was horrible. I was so scared of going yesterday for fear that would happen again that I almost didn't go. \n\nI was so heart warmed that you went out of your way to make me a special salad and absolutely hate that I couldn't enjoy it. Thank you for thinking of me and I'm sorry that happened. I hope I can beat this beast for good soon and be back to eating like a normal human.\"", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

Not ideal IMO. Lots of people in the threads have either changed their username or simply stopped using the app which means there\u2019s a lot of trial and error for little pay off.\n\nThis little web app I wrote should really help with this. The site, linked above, is an *opt-in* list of Peach users on this subreddit. The list is updated every 15 minutes and is sorted by how active each user is (currently by the number of posts they made in the last seven days) so the people who use Peach the most will be at the top. Each user has an \"add\" button below their name which will automatically launch the Peach app if you have it installed and add them as a friend.\n\nIf you would like to add yourself to the list, you may do so by adding @R_EDA as a friend on Peach. The bot will accept your request within 60 seconds and you should receive a message through Peach Chat as well as a link to the configuration portal for your Peach account. Through this portal you can configure the optional additional information you share on the list such as a display name, bio, and profile picture. Additionally, if you want to add your Peach username to your subreddit flair (like I have), you will also find a special token/pre-filled flair request form you can use to link your Reddit account. Finally, if you wish to remove yourself from the list, you may do so by unchecking \"Show profile in registry\" option on the configuration portal.\n\n**If you have any questions, feedback, suggestions, or just have trouble making this work, please let me know.

My dad would get angry about my weight, but then he'd make me eat adult-size portions at every meal. My mother would guilt trip me if I ever asked for junk food/dessert/etc. at the store or at restaurants, but then she'd spoil me by bringing home snacks and goodies as an expression of love.\n\nI was really confused about that in particular. I was constantly offered junk food, food as love/a reward, etc., but if I ever dared to ask for it, I was naughty? It taught me at an early age that if \"bad\" foods ever came into the house, I had to hoard them and eat them as quickly as possible. And when I got to high school and started being able to afford my own food, you can bet that it was ALL junk food I was too embarrassed to ask my parents for. It taught me artificial scarcity, and now that I understand more about the concept of food insecurity, it makes so much sense. If I'd just been allowed the occasional treat when I asked for it, instead of having to scavenge and hide everything I ate, I probably wouldn't have such a compulsion to binge.\n\nCan anyone else relate to this feeling?

{"post_id": "bg4x38", "created_utc": 1555954587, "title": "Diet Culture is the Worst", "author": "clarelandis", "self_text": "Disclaimer: specific eating disorder behavior mentioned\n\nThere was one weight loss magazine in the waiting room that made me belly laugh. It was clearly targeted toward postmenopausal women. It blamed the weight gain that often happens over 40 on \u201cdefective bile in 80% of women.\u201d Sure, it is your bile and not the major physiological changes happening as a result of menopause that\u2019s making you gain weight. The cover also claimed (yes, I got all of this without ever opening the magazine) that there is a candle scent that can increase hair volume by 30%. Great idea to suggest putting hair near an open flame. But, the thing that really got me was a bubble that said, \u201close 8 pounds in 7 days!\u201d It obviously wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d seen something like that on the cover of a magazine, but it was the first time seeing it and realizing how seriously dangerous it is to promote rapid weight loss. For starters, I don\u2019t think weight should be a topic for magazines. Weight loss or gain should be a conversation between an individual and their doctor or dietitian, not a topic weighed in on by the rest of the world.\n\nThe main thing that stood out to me about the danger was that I have lost 8 pounds in 7 days and it almost killed me. It was in January and through a combination of over exercising and severely restrictive eating that I managed to lose weight that quickly. After those 7 days, I ended up in the hospital for a week on an IV drip and had a tube up my nose. I remember the first night I was there, my blood sugar got low to the point my organs were going to start failing if I didn\u2019t get it up. My dad and the nurse both started yelling at me to drink some juice and I refused, I couldn\u2019t do it. After lots of tears, I got the juice down and was still so disoriented that when my mom said something about nurses coming in during the night, I was genuinely surprised and had no idea they had been there. The next day the doctor came in and told me that if I didn\u2019t start eating, I would likely go into congestive heart failure. It scared me, but not enough. I would still unplug my feeding tube pump from the wall and then plug it back in because I had figured out that it would stop working after it had been unplugged just for a second, then I pretended to have no idea why it wasn\u2019t working. I was so fixated on the weight loss that I didn\u2019t care about anything else. I didn\u2019t care if I lived, I just wanted to be skinnier. \n\nSo, that magazine really pissed me off. It\u2019s encouraging women to abuse their bodies. Insanely fast weight loss isn\u2019t good for anyone. If you do need to lose weight for health reasons, there\u2019s a safe, gradual way to do it (which can be talked through with an MD or an RD, not with some magazine) and it sure as hell isn\u2019t a crash diet that will make you drop 8 pounds in 7 days. Sadly, this problem is not isolated to a single magazine, it\u2019s our society. We encourage women and men to pursue body shapes that are so unnatural they could literally die. And for what? What is so much better about being a size 0 woman or a man with exactly 7% body fat? It doesn\u2019t make you a better person. Someone who is a size 0 doesn\u2019t accomplish more than someone who is a size 6; in fact, they probably accomplish less because they spend so much time trying to shrink themselves. I would know, making yourself tiny is just a huge time and money pit. Why do we worry about being small? There\u2019s no point. Granted, I\u2019ll be the first to admit I still fall into this trap. In all of my values and beliefs about a meaningful life, being small isn\u2019t a single one of them, yet I still do stupid shit to try and shrink myself. I\u2019ve been out of treatment for less than two weeks and have already skipped a few meals. I promised myself this time would be different, that I would really do it this time, and it still can be; it would just be a lot easier if society didn\u2019t place our worth on a jeans size and tell us to lose weight until we die.\n\n[https://thiscrazybeautifullife.home.blog/posts/](https://thiscrazybeautifullife.home.blog/posts/)", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

They know they can\u2019t directly criticise my size and tell me to lose weight because the last time something like that happened (I overheard them talking about how big I had gotten) I didn\u2019t speak to them for seven weeks despite living with them at the time. \n\nThey have both passed comment on what I\u2019m eating - \u2018you\u2019re making THAT for dinner\u2019 \u2018oh I won\u2019t eat that meal with you I\u2019m not eating carbs\u2019.

I said right back \u2018I have a friend coming over tomorrow and we\u2019re ordering a pizza and I won\u2019t be criminalised for it\u2019 and he backed down.

He\u2019s type II and his favourite line is to condemn us by shouting that we\u2019re all going to get diabetes if ANYTHING sugary is in sight, or for example if I\u2019m baking to unwind (which I used to when I was in school). He gets so combative out of nowhere. \n\nThey both make these indirect comments - yesterday both of them had a big worked up conversation while I was there about how it\u2019s so terrible to be overweight, it affects everything health wise, that their weight gain is absolutely horrifying and terrible and that they\u2019re being so serious about their health, weight around your middle is so bad. It just felt very pointed and indirect and the whole self-flagulating aspect about their own weight and bodies is what fucked up my own body image as a child. \n\nI\u2019m just dreading that a moment will come where one of them, especially my dad will bring it up more directly. My mom has already asked if I\u2019m still going to the gym (I joined last year). Especially when it comes to the end of the vacation I\u2019m dreading a passing comment or a suggestion that exercise is important or something. \n\nI\u2018ve found it too hard so far to bring up my BED and food issues to my therapist (only seeing him three weeks so far). He\u2019s very interested in parenting in particular and sees that I have a lot of issues about needing to be the perfect child and fearing judgment, failure etc from my parents. I know my anxiety about them seeing me as a failure for getting fat is linked to all of this but I\u2019m so embarrassed to bring it up to him.

I plan to go to the doctor in 4 months if I can't manage to recover my period on my own. I've added nut butters and meat to my diet. I'm going to try adding a lot of carbs to my diet next week, maybe I eat too much protein... I'm feeling really sad and heavily stressed about this, I'd like to hear some stories of you ladies getting your periods back to give me some hope and motivation. I don't want to have no periods for life, I'm very scared of osteoporosis and bone related complications. While I don't want kids anytime soon, the thought of infertility is also depressing. Funny to say this, but I miss my period and I really want it back, so jealous of girls who have it. :'(", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

To start with, I'm 20F and have generalized anxiety and minor depression (seeing a therapist for them). In the past I've had problems with disordered eating including bingeing, and occasionally becoming obsessive about food intake (not restricting, just tracking obsessively).\n\nRecently, I've started exercising more frequently and snacking less. Nothing too serious. However, for the past week-ish, I've noticed that it's not just that I'm eating less but I feel like I can't eat more. My partner has told me that I don't eat enough and I think they're probably right but I just...don't want to? Other things that make me think it might be an ED are that weight loss is tied to body image for me and I tend to associate \"feeling good\" with times that my collarbones are more visible, when I can feel my ribs, less fat to pinch, etc. However, I'm usually like that when I eat a lot too so I don't know if it's related.  \nIt's only been about a week and usually when I've gone through periods like this, they end within a few days. I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or if it's actually ED related. I\u2019m mostly hesitant to say it\u2019s an ED since I actually do eat.

It probably matters in some sort of sociology-context that I am a nurse and work in a heavily woman-dominated clinic, having transitioned from trauma/burn ICU which had a pretty solid mix of men and women in it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe had a unit meeting yesterday and our manager brought bagels. There were probably 16 people in the room? I\u2019d spent a disconcerting amount of brain space the night before mulling over whether I\u2019d eat a bagel at the meeting the next day. So we all sit down and one of my chronically-dieting coworkers is like \u201cdammit! I\u2019m going to be bad and have a bagel.

You\u2019re obviously eating something. But I just ignored her and reminded myself that the only thing I can control is my own thoughts and actions and I really am working on being less reactively judgmental, myself, I swear.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

{"post_id": "bghy50", "created_utc": 1556034527, "title": "Recovery is possible.", "author": "jd_2300", "self_text": "Not sure if this belongs here or not but I wanted to share this with people struggling, either in their recovery or those who haven\u2019t yet started recovery and are in the depths of ED. Really sorry if I\u2019m breaking any rules yikes\n\nIn the summer of 2017 I was diagnosed with [eating disorder]. Prior to this diagnosis I had been struggling with an eating disorder for about 3 years. I\u2019m not going to go into detail, but I was very, very ill. In 2017 I was hospitalized following a suicide attempt, and based on my behavior in the psych ward I was referred to an eating disorder program. During the intake for that program they discovered that I was basically dying. The muscle of my heart was being steadily eaten away and they told me if I didn\u2019t seek treatment I would likely pass away quite soon. I was convinced they were lying and that I was perfectly alright. I wasn\u2019t drastically underweight or anything like that. \nSince spending several months in an IOP program, I have had many relapses. In fact I was absolutely DETERMINED to relapse and to be drastically underweight. I did not want to recover, at all. I would scream and cry and throw tantrums pretty much every day when I was forced to eat. I even nearly acted out plans to run away from home, simply because I didn\u2019t want to eat.\n\nHowever, by the time a year had passed of this forced \u2018recovery\u2019, I started seeing a change in myself. The urges to relapse were lessening, and I found myself actively fighting the disordered thoughts. Put simply, my life was better without ED. I had energy, I was lively, I felt physically well instead of always feeling lethargic and sick. \n\nFast forward another year and.. I don\u2019t even want to relapse anymore. Anorexia turned me into a monster. I was selfish and cruel. I put my eating disorder above everybody and everything, I did absolutely anything to satisfy ED. That meant ignoring my family and friends, isolating myself from everyone, and constant lies. Without ED dictating my every thought and action, I am so much closer to my family. And the joy that my family brings me is FAR better than any \u2018happiness\u2019 anorexia could have EVER provided. I am so thankful and happy to have finally chosen to recover. People say it all the time but it\u2019s SO TRUE. Life without an eating disorder is 100x better than \u2018life\u2019 with an active eating disorder. \n\nI know so well the lures and pretty lies that ED uses. But I swear they\u2019re all just lies. What I really want to convey is that there is no such thing as \u2018not sick enough\u2019. Because I would likely have never survived to be \u2018sick enough\u2019, my heart would have stopped beating before I ever reached a \u2018dangerously\u2019 low BMI. If you are struggling, you are sick enough. If you are using any behaviors, you are in danger. Your weight and BMI have NOTHING to do with how ill you are. Eating disorders are deadly and they do not discriminate based on your size.\n\nI hope the biggest takeaway from this post is that RECOVERY IS POSSIBLE. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever recover, I didn\u2019t even have any desire to. But here I am, after two years of hard work, and I think I can say I am fully recovered. I no longer have any fears or irrational thoughts about food, and for the most part my body image is okay. I am fully weight restored and you know what? I\u2019m glad for that. I have a butt again lol.\n\nPlease don\u2019t give up on yourself in recovery. It takes a helluva lot of work and time, but I swear it\u2019s possible. Please, if you\u2019re a minor tell your caregivers or a trusted adult what you are going through. If you\u2019re an adult please tell your doctor. The first step is the hardest, but it is SO WORTH IT. I can\u2019t stress how much better life is on the other side.\n\nGood luck to you all and you can always message me if you need a chat or a friend.", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

I really hope someone else can relate to this shitshow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI go to a competitive girls' school where you're considered fat if you have a BMI over 18. 16.00 is the perfect number. The popular girls are the thinnest, BMI's usually in the 15s. Some 14s, some 16s. Depends on bone structure. People compare ribs, thighs, kneecaps, wrists, collarbones, hipbones at recess. Even if you have 20 inch hips, a thigh gap is expected. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirls look at thinspo in class. Meanspo/bonespo is, understandably, more private. Everyone's instagram is skinny legs and ribcage and artsy bodychecks. Nobody, and I mean \\*nobody\\* eats lunch. The perfect girls don't eat before eight. I once got called a glutton because I eat breakfast every day. If you're dieting you can't eat over 500 calories. Normally people say they stay under 1000. Diet coke and black coffee are life. Also ciggies if you're super badass.  Gonna pass out? Have a bite of an apple -\\_-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPurging: everyone does it; nobody talks about it. The pipes in the bathrooms are fucked. Also it's not uncommon to go outside and see someone running around the school every lunch for an hour. The sani bins stay empty.  Everyone knows someone who went to the hospital after ODing on lax. There's also clumps of hair, like, everywhere.  White girls either get fake tans or rock the so-pale-you-can-see-my-veins look. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy is everyone so disordered? Perfectionism. I've seen people have mental breakdowns and self harm in the toilets because of a B (not denying I haven't). Most people study 8 hours a day on weekdays, 10-16 on weekends. Nobody gets over 5 hours of sleep. Also private school boys like em skinny.

WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK, DUDE?!?\n\nNow that that's out of my system, here's my story:\n\nLast night two friends and I were raiding my closet for dresses for a party next weekend. Let's call one of the friends Taylor, and I'll note right off the bat that they use singular they/them pronouns (to avoid confusion for those of you that aren't used to it grammatically). \n\nAnyway, Taylor KNOWS I have a history with EDs. They also deal with body dysmorphia. Like, ok, cool, that's all fine and dandy; obviously it sucks, but it's no skin off my back that other people can have problems too. HOWEVER, Taylor is constantly complaining about it and making excessive comments about their own body and proportions in front of just about anyone that range from crazy positive to super-self deprecating in a matter of minutes. Taylor was already bugging me last night doing this, flopping on whether they are the same size as me every few seconds. Like again, I get it, I've been there, but you don't need to bring my body into it and put me in a place where I have no fucking clue how to respond appropriately when you disagree with every supportive counterpoint to your self-deprecation I try to make, only to turn around and try to assert my points back at me when I concede. \n\nA few highlights to outline the night include that Taylor started out positive, making comments about how after a month of exercising they were seeing abs come in (which, btw, was not the case - I can say from experience that it's extra skin from losing weight). When they were trying on dresses, they couldn't stop talking about how they are afraid of tape measures so they can't buy clothes that fit well (like, I get the tape measure thing, but let's be real, sizing charts mean nothing anyway, and whether a piece is flattering or not depends a ton on the style, not \\*just\\* the size. I even get dysmorphia getting in the way of getting flattering clothing, but not knowing your dimensions can't be the only reason), and kept making comments that their proportions are \"whack.\" \n\nFinally, they said something along the lines of telling me that I looked better than them in every one of the dresses we tried on THAT I OWN AND BOUGHT FOR MY BODY, BTW, SO YEAH, THEY'RE GONNA LOOK BETTER ON ME and after all their proportion comments I couldn't think of anything else to say and just said something along the lines of \"Yeah I have an hourglass figure so I buy dresses well suited for that\" and they come back with \"I have an hourglass figure too. My measurements are XX-XX-XX,\" and then shit really hit the fan. They fucking WENT OFF on me saying things like \"I know you have body image issues too, but you're \\~skinny\\~ so you don't actually know what it's like. You don't know what it's like to be the biggest person in the room, to actually have a reason to feel huge and to have dysmorphia,\" for a few solid minutes.\n\nLike, first of all, I lost 30 fucking pounds before I met Taylor and was around the same size if not bigger than them before that. Also, I have actually dealt with the real-world consequences of a constant cycle of binging, purging, and restricting, which I have a very strong feeling they never have because if they did, they would make sure I and all the people around them knew it as they do with every tiny problem they have (my favorite example was when they had trouble sleeping for three nights and would not stop talking about their \"crippling insomnia\"). But really most importantly, just because I am smaller than them does not mean that my issues can't be as valid as theirs, and HOW DARE they make any comparative comments about my body like that, let alone saying I don't get to have mental health issues surrounding my body because I'm \"skinny.\"\n\nThank you for letting me vent. \n\nTLDR; Was trying on dresses with friends, one of them was complaining about their body image issues and comparing themself to me all night, and at the end went off on me about how I don't know what body dysmorphia is like because I'm \"skinny.\"", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

They only ruled out a few possibilities so far. I got a referral to a center that focuses more on these issues. Needless to say I am absolutely terrified.\n\nIs there anything I should be prepared for when I'm being tested or when I get treatment for whatever it is I have. How do I hide all this from my caregivers (who I know will just say I'm looking for attention and am vaccine injured or something even though its visibly affecting my physical health). What is the average cost of medicines, if any are even prescribed? I have so many questions and not enough answers \n\nBTW for context: I'm a 17 year old girl so while I can go to appointments by myself its for the most part recommended to have a trusted individual like a friend or parent come with, I guess for moral support or something. I also have aspergers and scoliosis and did ballet for 8 years (had to quit cos my scoliosis had deteriorated rip) in case that's going to have any impact on anything idk", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Always told me stuff like \"hey maybe you should try losing a few pounds\", \"girls won't like you if you're fat\", etc., although she never expressed the importance of proper nutrition or offered to help. I took matters into my own hands when I started starving myself. She of course noticed and accused me of being anorexic, which I denied, denied, denied, and threatened to take me to a psychiatrist.\n\nShe tells me I'm not fat, doesn't make me feel better but whatever. At the same time though she constantly points out the negative aspects of my body. She tells me my acne's gross, and that I need muscle, and that I need to stop biting my nails. And that \"girls won't want to go out with me if I look like that\". These things, especially the muscles comment, do not fucking help with my body image at all.

{"post_id": "bgrzyy", "created_utc": 1556093255, "title": "Seeking Advice", "author": "emmajane2018", "self_text": "I recently met the girl of my dreams on Bumble. Funny, I didn't even know I wanted to be with a girl. Sure I'd had relationships with women in the past but, for the last 4 years I've been exclusively dating men. Out of no where I sort of thought, \"hey maybe it would be cool if I went on a date with a girl\". So I changed the settings on my Bumble to seeking \"everyone\". I wasn't really expecting much. Over the coming weeks I barely participated in the swipe game. Here and there when I got bored I swiped a few people. I ended up matching with about 5 girls total. Of which only one started a conversation with me. Boy am I glad she did. We hit it off. Talking everyday for a couple of weeks until with both decided it was definitely time to take things into the real world. She asked me what my ideal date would be. I said, \"probably dinner followed by a nice walk, so we can actually get some conversation in\". Thinking back every time I brought up the idea of dinner for a date she would simply change the subject. At that stage I didn't think much of it. So I ended up agreeing to just go out for a drink with her. As it would turn out she was moving house that week. So the night came around and she said she was exhausted. I said, \"not to worry, I know how hard moving is. If you wanna just come around to my place and have a drink after work I'd be down with that too\". So it was all set she was coming to my place on Saturday night.   \nSaturday night rolls around. She arrives at my house. Wow! she was stunning. A totally banging rockabilly beauty. She had this confident masculine energy and easy going nature about her that was just everything I was looking for in a sexy feminine body. She was perfect for me. We decided to go to the bottle shop for drinks because I had nothing at home. She walked out with vodka lime and sodas. I joked with her that those were my usual go to drink because they had the lowest calories. She laughed. So we go back to my place and later on that night after a few drinks with me she reveals that she has this eating disorder. I'm like shit, that's serious. As a trans woman myself I know all about body issues so I know this is serious. I asked her which one. She reveals, anorexia. She then goes on to explain that she's in the middle of a relapse. Shes about 3 weeks in. At this point I guess she expected me to have some sort of reaction, but honestly all it makes me want to do is help her. \n\nWe've been hanging out now for 2 weeks and all shes eating is half a falafel wrap each day. On the days she goes to work she has a sugar free mother as well. The last few days she hasn't even really wanted to eat the wrap. I've had to sort of try to encourage her. I know that when I do this I'm walking a fine line between helping her and pushing her away. I really care about her and all I want to do is help. I feel like there's something really special about her and I don't wanna lose her. She's lost a lot of weight since I met her and I'm pretty sure that soon her mum and dad are going to hospitalize her. Either way I'm gonna hang around and support her through it. I guess I just wanted to reach out to people with more experience then I have and ask is there anything that I can do to stop this thing from progressing? Any attempt to get her to add calories in even the most minor way is met with total aversion and I don't wanna push to hard because I'm scared I'll lose her. I'm also scared she's going to feint and have a car crash because her blood sugar must be so low. She never has any energy at all.   \n\n\nI'm really sorry if anything I've said on this post was insensitive or offended anyone. I am a total newb when it comes to ED's.

My starting weight was 227 and I'm down to 191, for a total weight loss of 36 lbs so far. I have struggled with food and overeating throughout my life, since I was 10. I have attempted dieting and food restriction, which I could only manage for a short amount of time before I crack and binge again. In 2009-2010 I became severely depressed, and ballooned up from 175 (I think) to 215 lbs. I remember at the point in my life I felt completely out of control over my food. I would go to buy binge food and it would feel like something was forcing me to go buy it, like if I didn't do it something horrible happened. I was possessed by some food demon. It settled down in the summer, at least enough that I wasn't gaining weight anymore, but I was still very much overeating nearly every day.  \n  \nIn 2012 I managed to get down to 170 lbs, mostly through eating very little during the day (I'm kind of a nighttime warrior so to speak), but I got complacent with my food and my weight kept creeping up. In 2013 I was diagnosed with gallstones at the age of 24 and had my gallbladder removed. I have digestive issues related to this that unhealthy eating (i.e. eating high-fat foods) exacerbates. In 2014 I got blood test results showing my TSH was elevated. I went into total freakout mode, ate a very restrictive diet for 1 month, lost 10 lbs, then went back to overeating. My TSH has been normal now for a long time now so I don't know what was happening there. I get up to over 200 lbs again. In 2016 I started attending OA meetings, got a sponsor, worked the program, then quit after completing step 1 because I read a bunch of stuff online about how AA (and by extension all 12 step programs) are cults and it scared me away. I still go to meetings sometimes. Also in 2016 I weighed in at my heaviest weight of 231. I couldn't believe I had gotten so big.\n\nSo about my actual food. Before I started losing weight, I was overeating basically every day. I would eat out a lot, eat large portions for meals, eat whole bags of chips or 4-packs of cupcakes, or eating cookies, donuts, french fries, pizza, etc. I also have a history of binge eating and emotional eating. I would get a craving for a food and it would feel almost impossible to resist. I felt little to no motivation to eat well because the bad foods tasted better and made me feel warm inside. \n\nThis year I have committed to eating better and exercising more and so far it has paid off. Part of my dietary changes have involved avoiding foods that I overeat: foods like chips, french fries, ice cream, chocolate candy, crackers, baked goods, etc. I have managed to stay away from most of these; I have eaten corn chips 4 times this year but I was able to go back to eating normally after then.  \n  \nBut I'm concerned that the way I'm eating now will ultimately set me up for failure. I have not gone in 100% on eating healthy; I still incorporate some junk food-y items, but they're in smaller packages, or they're \"healthier\" or whatever. I still consume most of my calories after 5-6 pm. The times I have eaten more in the morning or afternoon, I feel like I can't eat as much at night and sometimes I feel like I'll go crazy if I don't eat more. I will go on walks to burn more calories so I can eat more and maintain my caloric deficit of 1000 calories a day. Or sometimes I do go over my calories. So far this hasn't ruined me. I've been motivated to lose weight and have been successful so far. But I can't help but feel like soon I'll fall and won't be able to get back up because it has happened so many times. I'm afraid if I cut out all unhealthy processed foods and go 100% clean or whole-food-plant-based I will binge. I tried to stop buying junky snack foods but I gave in yesterday because I had calories to spend, and I spent it on slightly less unhealthy versions of junk foods I used to eat instead of fruit and nuts like I had originally planned. I still have the food crazies in me, I am just not sure if it's binge eating, or overeating, or food addiction.  \n  \nTL;DR: I have struggled with overeating and binge eating for most of my life and it got me up to 231 lbs. I have felt powerless over food and my cravings for most of that time too. This year I have managed to lose 36 lbs through healthier diet and exercise, but I still engage in similar eating patterns that I did when I was not watching my food (eating mostly at night, saving my calories for dinner and evening snacks), and still overeating while maintaining my calorie deficit. I am afraid if I don't get this under control I will fail and go back to eating whatever whenever, which I don't want to happen. I want to eat like a normal person. I want to be at peace with food and be a healthy weight, but if that means only eating 1200 calories a day of chicken and vegetables for the rest of my life, then I would rather die.\n\nSorry this is so rambly. It would take hours to edit this to make it more coherent and honestly I can't wait to reach out any longer. I am afraid I will lose control again and I won't be able to come back from it.\n\nEDIT: If you have any questions because I didn't provide enough info or what I said makes no sense please ask because I don't understand this either.", "subreddit": "FoodAddiction"}

{"post_id": "bgzjfk", "created_utc": 1556137530, "title": "Am I developing BED after anorexia?", "author": "regina-george-", "self_text": " This might be a long post.\n\n\nI was diagnosed and went into IOP treatment for anorexia when I was sixteen and a sophomore in high school, and continued going to therapy and doctors appointments at that same treatment center for about a year after that. Once I was about a senior, my mom decided I could stop going to therapy because she felt like I had improved. She was still prepping my meals and whatnot, and monitored my weight and what I was eating pretty closely. My mental state was pretty terrible, I felt extremely uncomfortable with the weight gain.\n\n\nI gradually think I lost a few pounds naturally here and there as I entered my freshman year of college, as my mom and I had started going on hour long walks again, (we used to do this during the eating disorder but stopped once I entered treatment) and I wasn't eating as strictly as I had been. I was on the lower end of a healthy weight for my height, and the weight loss wasn't really intentional. \n\n\nI got my first boyfriend my freshman year of college, and he ended up cheating on me in the summer. I kind of spiraled, and lost a bit more weight. I am now a sophomore in college and I at some points this year I have been at or near the same weight I was when I went into treatment the first time. \n\n\nHowever, I went through January deciding I wanted to just gain a few pounds and not have such a rigid schedule with food- I was tired of food controlling my life, so I decided to try and eat a bit more. I'm not sure if extreme hunger is a real phenomenon, but that entire month was sort of spent overeating (possibly binging?) and my mom took notice and confronted me. She thought I needed to see a therapist.\n\n\nI don't necessarily feel out of control when I'm eating, but I feel like I need to make the most of the times I slip up because I'm not going to let myself eat that food again very often. Most of the time I also feel hungry. I know the solution to this would just be to work on intuitive eating and fixing my relationship with food, but I have a routine of foods I like to eat.\n\nSo I've been seeing my therapist, and I went back to watching my food intake for the last three months because I want to get back to a lower weight and I feel embarrassed about my mom catching me eating so much. I haven't brought up the eating disorder issues with the therapist even though I know I should, because I'm afraid of change. Right now I feel like I can go back to the anorexia whenever I want and I don't want that control taken away.\n\n\nThe past week I feel like I've started to overeat again, and I don't know why. I'm afraid I'm developing binge eating disorder. Could that be it, or is my body just craving the things I have been restricting from it for three years? Ever since I stopped going to the treatment center I have eaten pretty clean, I still avoid a lot of foods like cookies, candy, ice cream, etc. I tend to eat the same things every day and I never let myself have treats.\n\n\nI don't know what to do. I feel like food controls my entire life, and it's all I think about every day. I just turned twenty one, and I feel like I'm still caught up with issues other girls my age have gotten over because I'm still obsessed with being skinny, and I only like myself when I'm a certain weight.\n\n\nI know the logical answer would be to open up to my therapist and get help, but I just want to keep the illusion of the control of choices I have. I know anorexia is controlling me though.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I'm more than halfway through my 2nd pregnancy and even though the scale is still a huge fear of mine (I refuse to look at the numbers) and only have my doctor tell me if I'm on track or not. I have never felt more in control of my weight. My children are my reason for full recovery, they need their mama and I will always be there for them. They are my life now, not this disease and this disease will never control me again because I have so much more in my life than this disease.

I hated these comments because I hate people who feel so entitled to comment on my body. Some people are naturally skinny. Others calorie restrict to get that body. These comments are projecting so much self-hatred it makes me both sad and frustrated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was talking to my friend about how I'm becoming obsessed with achieving a very specific body type at the moment. He's overweight and restricts calories. 2019 has been a tremendously healing year for me, despite my mental battle with possibly spiraling back into an eating disorder again. My god, this is the first year possibly in my life that I have had amazing daily bowel movements. Especially because I hated going to the bathroom for years. Anyways, he told me he thinks it's completely unhealthy that I'm eating so much. I've been tracking calories again out of curiosity. I eat on average 2500 calories intuitively. I exercise an hour everyday on top of walking 3-4 miles on hills because of school. I have worked so fucking hard to leave my eating disorder behind me and embrace weight/muscle gain and to hear this makes me wanna lose my shit. Now I feel like I'm slowly restricting myself again, becoming obsessed with counting calories and how I can eat less, burn more, etc. because I feel like I'm eating too much. I'm gaining too much, this isn't healthy even though my BMI is finally 19 and not in the underweight range. I feel like there is nothing wrong with being medically considered unweight or \"healthy\" weight as long as you feel good mentally and physically.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really dislike people who do not have a grasp of the role genetics/biodiversity plays in metabolism. Yeh that comment personally sucked for me but I think if people are saying stuff like this to me, I cannot imagine what they tell themselves or other overweight people. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomeone could be my exact same height, eat the exact same as me, do the exact same exercises and we'd still end up with completely different bodies because genetics does play a large role. Some people are naturally size 00 with 23 inch waists and twig arms without exercise and eating all junk food. Others are size 4/6 naturally. Some people gain weight more easily than others. If I've learned anything from recovery, it's that all bodies are good bodies. Our bodies keep us alive, all our bodies do is heal us. I wish people could have a grasp that each body is unique and to embrace all the different types of bodies that exist in the world. It might sound cliche, but my god it's true!

So all in all only about **20ish calories per cup**!!! Usually I brew at least 8 or 10 oz of coffee at a time so I have a cup and a half to two. I may be lying to myself but it actually tastes quite good. Also, I don't measure meticulously (recovery!!!! lol) so this may not be super accurate.\n\nTip: try adding a little bit of salt to the grounds before you brew. Helps balance out the bitterness (though that's prob getting lost in all the sweetness anyway lol!).

I also wanted to remind anyone that might think they are failing because they aren't having the perfect run that you are not! I used to regard my binges in this way and things are far better since I've put those thoughts into perspective. As a 0 or 100 (with no in between) type of person, even if I had a good run for weeks and then I spiralled back into a binge, I was a failure. If anyone thinks like this out there please first reflect on where you have come from. There are waaaay more wins than this idea of \"I'm only a success once the bingeing completely stops\". If your binges are declining in frequency or severity, that is HUGE progress! If you are trying to better understand your binges (eg. becoming mindful of your mental states around binges and teasing out patterns in your behaviour) that is awesome. If you are trying to implement strategies that tackle your binge eating and promote good habits that is fucking fab! Not every strategy has to work either, some ideas that seemed good on paper may not pan out, but if you're trying you ARE making progress, and getting ever closer to the right strategies by eliminating the ones that are unhelpful! For some, the very act of reaching out for help (be it on Reddit, opening up for the first time to friends/family, or seeking therapy) is a huge step. Humans are social creatures, we like to feel like we are not lonely in our plight. Plus two (or more) brains tackling a problem is always better than one. There is no shame in reaching out &lt;3 \n\nAnyways sorry for the long and corny post lol, but if even one person changes how they treat themselves after are after a slip up then I am so chuffed.

However, the people in our lives by my baseless assumption, carry judgement on the very subject on our age, gender, and how much they want to fuck us in the face. \n\nI met a man in the army who told me that his girlfriend throws up her lunch and dinner all the time. He's quite caring and concerns about her which is really sweet. He also glorifies how skinny she is, which is sour, considering her work out schedule is getting plowed by him twice a week and not much else, while his is a four times a day gym routine that includes creatine and fried chicken. \n\nWe look as good as we feel, and when we're down about things that don't matter, like a number on a scale or a list, we feel lessened and then if practiced enough, we learn to hate ourselves through these actions. \n\nI am very sure that undoing it is simple. Much like quitting smoking, there has to be the breaking of habitual thought processes and activities. Feeling guilty for having lunch? Fuck that. Go walk your dog for an hour and if you don't have a dog, get one. \n\nWanting to starve to compensate for something you don't really need? Fuck that. Remember that though it may seem true that we have to make ourselves a certain way to appeal to others, what really stands in the long run is a proper relationship with ourselves. \n\nDon't forget that, Richard.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

{"post_id": "bhjsbn", "created_utc": 1556265735, "title": "Mantras/mindsets that have been helping me immensely as of late, and some other things that have been helping me get through my days.", "author": "pm-me-ur-dinner", "self_text": "There are a few things i have been sort of meditating on lately that really put me in perspective and put me *in* my body/mind in the current moment. \n\n1. *Self compassion*. Compassion. What exactly is compassion? Think about how you would treat a loved one. Imagine one of your closest relatives crying from pain, and suffering. Meditate on how that makes you feel. Now reflect similarly towards yourself. Think about how often you suffer, and how helpless you feel with nowhere to turn for help. Be gentle with yourself. There are plenty of wonderful articles on the internet on Self Compassion and i greatly encourage you to explore.\n\n\n2. Reminding myself, and repeating to myself, that *I am worthy.* It might feel cheesy at first, or just straight out wrong, but the more uncomfortable it makes you feel, the more you must repeat it. Of course in the beginning i thought i felt worthy. Sure. Of course im worthy. But the more i repeated this affirmation, the deeper i got. I eventually dug down into the dark pit of self-pity self neglect (where all that excess food goes!). And boy, did i feel it. This is where the self compassion really helps and comes into play. You have to tell yourself and make yourself believe that you ARE WORTHY of happiness, good health, and a satisfying life. You are worthy of LOVE, especially love coming from SELF. You are WORTHY. *You are worthy!* When you start to actually believe it, remind yourself how worthy you are when you\u2019re about to binge. You might make a change of plans.\n\n\n3. *I am enough. I have everything I need and more.* People go weeks without eating. Whether for spiritual reasons, or simply because they dont have access to food. This is where I count my blessings. I list (mentally, or sometimes on paper) all the things I am grateful for. A warm bed, with blankets and pillows. A roof over my head. Clean water to drink. Food to nourish my body. A loving family. Internet and technology. These are all LUXURIES, and the list goes on. We are living in abundance!! Express your gratitude and think about how lucky you are to even have access to all this food.\n\n\nSome other things that help:\n\n-Nightly tea routine. \n\nFind an herbal tea that you really like. Be it a flavored herbal tea, or a simple natural variety. Add honey, milk, whatever. Spruce it up to your liking. Take it to bed with you and make this a routine. I have found that having tea to look forward too will help me stop me mid binge, especially before i reach for another sweet bite. I remember, \u201coo, you know what? I dont need this because i am going to have my tea tonight and it is going to be oh so satisfying!\u201d Not to mention, it also settles the stomach, soothes the mind, and refreshes the palate! I personally enjoy a cup of Kava with a spoon of honey, or a plain cup of chamomile lavender.\n\n\n- Eating a HUGE salad before a binge. \n\nSalads can easily rack up in calories, but i have found that if i try and binge after a salad, i consume way less in general overall if i have the salad first. I mean, we have to atleast get our veggies in first if we\u2019re planning on indulging! Theyre also really easy and quick to toss together so theres no time to munch on other things as you would if you were waiting for something to cook.  Not to mention, they are crazy satisfying, nourishing, and you dont feel as bad eating chocolate afterwards :)\n\n\n- Supplementing things you might need! \n\nChromium can help sugar cravings. Epa/Dha/omega3s can help your mood (which helps me immensely!). Magnesium can help those chocolate cravings. A cup of Emergen-C can seriously instantly boost your mood and wellbeing, while at the same time hitting that sweet tooth.\n\n\n\nI know this was an article and a HALF within itself... but i see you guys struggling and i just want you to know that\n\nYou are seen. \n\nYou are heard. \n\nYou are understood. \n\nAnd i HOPE that you might find just one thing from this that helps you even in the slightest bit.\n\nBecause you are worth it. You deserve a happy life. Find that compassion that lies deep within yourself. That love. Nurture the broken child within you.\n\nIts okay if no one even reads this because i am expressing my love and compassion to you guys! Im at least getting out there for anyone to stumble upon :)", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

{"post_id": "bhuzlf", "created_utc": 1556335149, "title": "Thank you guys. I joined this sub just a couple of weeks ago, and I'm already doing so much better.", "author": "paperairplanerace", "self_text": "**TL;DR you're all amazing and lovely people and I appreciate you.**\n\n\\--\n\nI didn't really know BED was a thing until JordanShrinks' recent in-depth video about it, and I did some research and joined this sub right away. Learning about that label/behavior pattern has really helped me to get a handle on methods and tools to help myself stop waffling, and find some semblance of consistency with food. I was moving through stages of a few days of controlled but excessively restricted eating, then a few days of loss of control and binges, then\u00a0a few days of anxious/inattentive/guilty anorexia, and just repeating that. I'd totally lost track of what intuitive eating is. But the different frameworks I've been able to adopt since visiting this community have really helped me with breaking that cycle!\n\nRight away after subbing here, I was recommended the Recovery Record app, which I installed and immediately fell in love with. I uninstalled the app I'd been using to track foods/calories/macros, and the app I'd been using to track intermittent fasting times (fasting has treated me phenomenally for years, but lately I've been going through some physical changes and it just isn't seeming like a fit for me anymore). I deleted all the calorie/macro calculations that were part of my notes of recipes I've been making lately. I had never previously considered the relationship of my OCD issues and the way anxiety affects them, in relation to diet, but the connection is obvious now in retrospect. I used RR a lot in the first several days, but have found myself spending less time and not logging in it consistently, because I'm having more and more healthy normal days without intrusive food thoughts and where there's nothing to really examine!\n\nAfter joining here and hearing from you guys, it hit me like a truck that the times in my life when I've felt healthiest and lost weight/kept it off most effectively were the times when I was just eating intuitively and getting/cooking whatever I wanted, with a loose \"get enough protein and fiber, let them take up enough space that there's not much room for sugars or pointless starches, eat lots of produce, and eat as much as I want so that I don't feel tired/shitty when working out\" principle, and little else in the way of guidelines. Those time periods also have been the times in my life when I was most food-secure, and I've been in and out of serious poverty including recently, so I realized I'm still influenced by those anxieties. Calorie restriction has always fucked me up and made me plateau/lose muscle/gain fat when I did it involuntarily because of poverty, so I don't know why I thought it would be any better if I did it in a controlled way now by trying to diet. My body likes burning fat if I keep sugar intake barely low at all, and I've never had to be super strict with carbs to stay in ketosis, which is good because I need to stay in that general range of food-styles to treat some nerve issues, so I do need to pay some attention or my sensory and nerve problems get significant. But when I try too hard to do it on purpose, I go all control-freak and enter my weird anorexia/binge cycle.\n\nI had never before attempted intuitive eating on *purpose*, but that's what I'm doing now. You guys, I already feel SO much better. I get hungry at the same times every day, which is helping me sleep at more consistent times (I have of late, but wherefore I know not, had hella worse issues with sleep than ever before, but that's starting to migrate back to normal). Also, I'm starting to notice being hungry at a normal level of hunger-feeling,\u00a0rather than feeling nauseated for hours before realizing it's been a day or two since I ate. I'm using a few mindfulness tricks that people here recommended as well, and they're really helping me with the act of observing when I'm starting to feel hungry and starting to feel full. I'm also craving healthier foods, and having fewer and fewer cravings for the foods that are usually involved in binges (chocolate in particular). A couple of times, I've been like \"I want a treat thing\" and wondered if it would trigger me into a binge, but I've been like \"Nah I deserve this treat thing\" and had the treat thing and then NOT binged or even had thoughts of bingeing AT ALL. Previously, I thought I could let myself have token treats but it always turned into a crash straight into a binge, but now that I've just sort of embraced my food-desires and am trying not to deny myself things constantly, I'm starting to feel a lot more normal about enjoying treats too, instead of having the weird impulse to obsessively overdose on treats because every time has the \"Okay but now I'll never do this again\" hanging over it.\n\nIt's like discovering a skillset I sorta always had, but never recognized before, so I didn't know how to implement it here or that it existed to implement here at all. I didn't even recognize the nature of the problem, but having that clarified made all the dots finally connect. You guys seriously helped me out, so directly and immediately and so effectively, the second I realized what I needed help with. I've only had a couple of binge moments in the last couple of weeks, and they weren't even that bad, just had that sense of \"I'd rather not be doing this but I can't stop myself\" otherwise they wouldn't really count, but they didn't last long or result in secondary impulsive poor decisions -- and most importantly, I didn't let myself bother feeling horrible about it afterward and slipping back into a cycle of anxious anorexia. Something about breaking up that particular chain in the reaction has really helped me with changing the nature of the cycle overall. There's something really powerful and helpful about just stepping back and observing those moments/impulses, and letting them pass by, like a meditation exercise, and it helps me get back to a steady level after those irregularities instead of getting thrown all out of whack.\n\nSo yeah, I just wanted to share this somewhere with people who I knew would understand how big these subtle shifts really are. Thank you all so much for being here, and for being so welcoming, and so forthcoming with information!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts to share about poverty experiences and the emotional way we react to a sense of scarcity, or the habits we form out of having to have that sense of scarcity for so long? I realized last year that I have a weirdly inflated emotional response to the sense of wasting anything that's pleasant, to the point where I would feel bummed/frustrated if I spent a while listening to a mediocre song on the radio and then switched only to land on the last few seconds of a favorite one. I have access to streaming music, why the hell trip on it? Because it felt like a weird waste. It's the same part of my brain that insists on \"crackheading\" (insensitive term, I know, but it's the most descriptive verb for the act) every last drop of food out of a container. I think that thought process is, for me, directly connected to experience with scarcity/deprivation, and also connects directly to my binge/anorexia cycles. Does that make any sense? Am I just stating the obvious and everyone who's more literate in the psychology of the subject already knows this?", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I practice intuitive eating everyday and I'll be honest when I say that while the concept is simple, the execution it isn't easy. There's a huge learning curve and it's very confusing after years of following rigid food rules. \n\n\n\nBut it is so *so* worth it. \n\n\n\nToday I didn't have breakfast. Not because I was restricting, not because I felt guilty over what I ate the day before. I just did not have the time and wasn't hungry until I left the house. \n\n\nI ate tacos with my mom for lunch. I ordered exactly what I wanted, I didn't pick apart the meat from the tortillas because of 'empty calories', and I got a horchata regardless and in spite of the voice in my head that screams at me for sugary liquid calorie consumption. I didn't have the sides even though in the early stages of recovery I would have, because all food felt new and fleeting then. My body was afraid that I would start restricting again at any minute so it wanted *everything* to store up and keep itself functioning and safe. I don't feel that sense of desperate urgency anymore, I eat what seems appealing or fits the situation and I move on. \n\n\n\nWhat's a better way to cool down on a hot day than tacos and horchata? This lunch was able to fuel a day full of walking around town and shopping with my mom. We had an amazing time. I wasn't fixated on what I ate or how much, I was present and able to enjoy myself and be pleasant company. We took selfies and I only thought for a minute about how big my face has gotten, my attention quickly turned to something else that felt more important than my appearance. \n\n\n\nFor dinner hours and hours later, I had a luxurious salad. It took a long time for me to be physically hungry again after my lunch, and that was okay. It had all of the extras that were forbidden to me back in the day; meat, cheese, y'know, anything that wasn't a low cal high volume vegetable. I didn't eat a salad to 'make up' for the fact that I ate out for lunch, it happened to be what my family was having and I wanted some! There was also a side of pita and grilled chicken which I had some of as well, leaving some of the pita because I was full. \n\n\n\nFor dessert, I was craving ice cream. I got triggered by a family friend and his talk of calories earlier after dinner. It made me want to restrict and not have dessert because the numbers were starting to trickle into my decisions. \nIn the past, I would have. Hell, in the past, real ice cream was only a fantasy. I convinced myself I didn't care for it, I developed a lactose intolerance because I avoided any and all dairy. \n\n\nBut I'm nowhere near that head space anymore.\n\n\nSo I marched to the freezer and made myself a bowl of brownie moose track ice cream. I chose a normal sized bowl, not a miniature one. I know that I can be trusted to portion out my food, and I know I'll stop eating when I feel done. \n\n\n\nThis obviously isn't how I eat all of the time. That's an awesome part of intuitive eating. I never want to go back to the time where I ate the same boring things at the same exact time every. single. day. \n\n\nI'm not free from my disorder.  I struggle everyday. Recovery is the one of the hardest things I've ever attempted, it's like a great accomplishment that no one really understands. Days like this show me how much progress I've made, how I've gained so many more important things that make the weight gain seem absolutely trivial, and how ridiculous the notion of relapse is. \n\n\n\nI deserve this. We all do.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I don\u2019t mean maintenance (god forbid) but a \u201cnormal\u201d amount that someone my size is told they \u201cshould\u201d eat to lose weight. An amount that I don\u2019t even need to lie to my family and friends about! Instead of eating under 1000cal and working out every day, I now eat just under 1300 a day (still workout pretty much every day). I\u2019ve never tried to eat more in response to binging before (despite being told it would help break the cycle). I\u2019ve always tried to make up for it by restricting. Well, to literally no one\u2019s surprise but my own, it\u2019s working. I haven\u2019t felt bingey since I started eating more, I can workout harder and have been able to restart weight lifting which I\u2019d had to stop when high restricting because my body just refused. I\u2019m far less miserable and losing more weight consistently than I would be if I was bouncing between binging and then restricting to make up for it. \n\nIs this recovery? Probably not, I\u2019m still obsessive and crazy and hate my body so so much....but it feels a whole hell of a lot better than binge/restrict hell! \n\nCheers, dolls!

This dress fit me perfectly and in my head I looked so good.\n\nThen you had to say this when I came into the bank:\n\n\u201cOh you look so cute, what a good time of year to be pregnant and wear cute little dresses.\u201d\n\nWat? Did I hear you right, maybe not...\n\nBut then.  Your dumb ass doubled down.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably exhausted though and disagree.  Being pregnant is hard work.\u201d\n\nI glared.

I may have been constipated (it happens when you don\u2019t eat much) and maybe that dress wasn\u2019t as flattering as I thought.  (I guess there\u2019s a reason mother got rid of it), but you sure didn\u2019t say that to the 300 lb woman behind me, did you?  You wouldn\u2019t have dared.\n\nYou not only ruined my day but you ruined the lunch I was going to eat with my husband right after.  There was lots of \u201cwhat\u2019s the matter babe\u201d?.

I had a plan, I felt safe. \n\nBut my bf at the last minute says 'let's get mcdonalds before the cinema, I don't want breakfast at home'. So I'm like ok this is a good opportunity to try and challenge my ED brain, but all I can think internally is how I'm panicking about not following my plan. And then we're in McDonald's so I pick a chicken big tasty to satisfy my craving and its the lowest cal burger I want. I only want a burger that's it. But my bf says I'll only get the nhs discount if I buy a meal so I'm like okay I can stretch to a couple of fries. Then I show the cashier my nhs badge and he's like oh you can get a free chicken mayo burger so I say OK, even though my ED brain is screaming no.\n\nAnd we sit down and I'm almost crying and my heart is pounding, but I'm chanting to myself 'eating because I'm hungry, eating because I'm hungry' and even though my bf offers to eat my free burger, I tell my him I'm gonna eat everything to prove myself nothing will happen and I won't gain any weight.\n\nSo the food comes, and I eat most of my chicken big tasty, half the free chicken Mayo and all the fries.\nAnd I'm just too full and feel like I'm gonna die but craving something sweet. So we buy a bag of maltesers and share them in the cinema.\n\nAnd now I'm home and all I wish I could do is throw up everything and go to the gym and burn it all off and never eat again. I feel so shit. I wish I'd never listened to him, I wish I'd just gone to the cinema hungry.\n\n I just don't know what to do.

I\u2019m obsessing about being over by a tiny amount.

I\u2019ve always had a contrary relationship with the stuff, worrying about eating too much and getting fat way younger I should\u2019ve. I was never really fat though, and I knew that, but the mirror didn\u2019t tell me that. For a while when I was around 13 I started binging and purging, gaining weight at 14 as I took a year off sport then losing it again when I picked sports up come age 15. \n\nI used to be obsessed with the idea of having a BMI of 18 despite having muscle. That was mostly during the depths of my self harm problems. I never got to that weight because it was unrealistic especially with me being short, I couldn\u2019t have ever stuck with 1k cal a day &amp; I didn\u2019t have enough control over my diet, as my Mum still fed me. I tried purging but it really didn\u2019t agree with me.\n\nSo I\u2019m 19 now and pick everything I eat. My weight does matter in my sport. I need to be under 60kg ideally, and I\u2019m 55kg. Realistically I know that means the odd binge won\u2019t hurt since it takes around 7000 calories to put on a kg I\u2019m now branching out into other sports I\u2019m gaining muscle and working out more and more. Some weeks I easily spend 10 hours or more working out. But in January I nearly weighed 60kg after I ate a lot around Christmas so I got really upset and started counting calories and macros. \n\nI\u2019m justifying counting them with needing to for sports but it\u2019s really becoming a problem. As soon as I eat something or plan to eat something I log it. Sometimes I\u2019ll go over my calories especially if I\u2019m eating around friends or my boyfriend and then I\u2019ll tell myself all of these awful things about myself and want to purge. I feel fat and overweight even though I know I\u2019m slim and toned, with a healthy BMI of 22. This week I\u2019m 1000 calories over so far (because I ate 2 Easter eggs on days when I didn\u2019t exercise) and I feel absolutely awful. I\u2019ve even bought myself a sports smart watch to help me work out exactly what I\u2019m burning during sessions, even though I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s wrong. I was on 1200 kcal a day back in February but now I\u2019m on 1500 if I\u2019m not exercising and 2000 if I\u2019m exercising. Which is technically loads. But it\u2019s healthy? I dunno it\u2019s messing with my head even though my body needs food. \n\nThese are only starting symptoms of an ED I know, and I\u2019ve got it under control, but fighting it is so horrible. My heart goes out to you guys who suffer every day. I know I\u2019m not that bad compared to others and it\u2019s so exhausting. Thanks for reading anyway.

I\u2019ve never been fully weight restored and have lost countless opportunities due to my illness, and I\u2019m beginning to be absolutely exhausted. I\u2019m sick of it, I\u2019m not willing to lose any more opportunities, and quite frankly I can\u2019t afford to live like this anymore. I want to go to grad school in two years and I know I\u2019m going to have to be \u201cwell\u201d to do so. I\u2019m right on the threshold of being medically unstable (and have been for years) and don\u2019t foresee myself restoring my weight alone. I'm currently seeing a therapist, a psych and recently have begun seeing a dietician.\n\nRecently my GP referred me to an inpatient program 8 hours away from home. Last week I had an intake appointment for said program but upon meeting with a social worker who is part of their \u201cteam\u201d, I\u2019ve begun to relapse more intensely. She started by asking for my weight and about \u201cmy concerns\u201d. Of course, I downplayed my symptoms because a) my ED doesn\u2019t want me admitting myself to this program and b) I genuinely have a hard time \u201cseeing\u201d how bad things really are. Based on the weight I told her, she used HER PHONE to calculate what BMI I\u2019d have to attain while admitted and told me this weight within THE FIRST 5 MINS of our meeting. This alone is a deterrent for me, and I began to cry. Then she proceeded to tell me I was ineligible for the inpatient program because \u201conly really sick people get a bed\u201d. She said that I would have to stay in a hotel room during the 8-12 weeks of OUTPATIENT treatment, something I cannot financially afford nor do I think that would that be safe. I get into a really terrible headspace during periods of weight restoration, and I genuinely do not think it would be safe for me to stay in a hotel room ALONE after spending the day partaking in their outpatient/day program. I tried to explain this to her, to which she said \u201cinpatient beds are for those with medical needs, not financial needs\u201d. This was too much, I broke down and didn\u2019t say much for the remainder of the meeting. She kept me for 45 mins and remember, I travelled 8 hours for this appointment.\n\nDespite all this, I did attend another intake appointment for the same program when I turned 18 (2.5 years ago). This appointment went over much better as I met with a psychiatrist as opposed to a social worker. At this time, my weight was slightly higher than it is now and I had not yet developed my substance abuse disorder. This woman highly recommended I drop out of uni to partake in their inpatient program, which I declined simply because it wasn't convenient at the time.\n\nSo basically: I had been counting on this appointment for the help I needed and now that this is what I\u2019ve been met with, I\u2019m spiralling. My therapist, GP and dietician are great, but I don\u2019t foresee myself ever getting weight restored alone. Amongst all this, my substance use is also escalating. I keep telling myself that things have been worse, but I\u2019m also reminding myself that they\u2019ve been better. All in all, has anyone else had similar experiences with ED treatment? Did you still manage to recover despite being met with such attitudes? And if so, how did you do it?\n\nFinally: please be gentle, I\u2019m in a really fragile state right now. I\u2019ve never made a post like this but I guess I\u2019m desperate for answers from people who have shared this experience. Please don\u2019t respond with weight/numbers or anything that could be potentially triggering.

Even when I don't look, I'm always subconsciously gripping at my body, checking for fat.\n\nHow do I feel comfortable in a body where I want to be healthy, but my mind is against me? I always feel like, if I look fat to myself, I don't deserve to relax or do my hobbies.\n\nI want to recover, eat food and be well. I want to see the skinny girl everyone else sees - and have that spark my desire to get better, not just from my families begging. But all I see is someone overweight, I'll automatically jump to the conclusion they're lying. TW body desc: &gt;!My ribs, hips, spine, shoulderblades... all stick out, it hurts.

I'm not saying it's not a good thing or not necessary. \n\nWhat I don't like are the people who take it out of context and promote BED and shame those who try to control it.

I've been so unhappy for such a long time and after years I'm finally getting the hang of it. What I hate are the people who tell me \"you don't need to lose weight to be beautiful\", \"you should be comfortable in your own skin\" or my favorite \"you are allowed to be human\". Alright cool thanks for the inspiration Samantha, let me fucking put that on a poster so you can hang it next to your \"eat pray love\" one. The reason I was fat at one point was because I ate a family of four pantry in one self hating binge. It's even worse when you're accused if being fatphobic. \n\nI bring this up because I've recently started to lose weight just from getting my BED in check. I've been getting messages on social media saying I shouldn't hate myself and I'm fatphobic for wanting to be smaller and wanting to control my intake.

She also is aware that lots of people don't have access to therapists or psychologists so she shares a lot of tips and analogies as well.\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCey1WBhNthBx0vDy-pHe9uw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCey1WBhNthBx0vDy-pHe9uw) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome videos that really resonated with me:\n\nRelapse denial -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTlUj-JzS7k&amp;t=](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTlUj-JzS7k&amp;t=) \n\nLetting go and gaining weight -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtZbaqNiPPk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtZbaqNiPPk) \n\n10 things -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcdPx1OVis8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcdPx1OVis8) \n\n\"Not ill enough\"   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DvzGIKpWv4&amp;t=](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DvzGIKpWv4&amp;t=)", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I don\u2019t have a doctor so I never went for advice) and my binges have been pretty bad.\n\nRecently I thought I could see the light at the end of the tunnel, I was feeling better, almost no pain which meant I could go back to the hiit workouts with a few modifications, and then I was in an accident, the injuries I sustained aren\u2019t life threatening but it will take months before I can tolerate even a little exercise. Minimum I can\u2019t do anything for 6 weeks. \n\nThis has made my binging even more frequent, and I\u2019d say they\u2019re almost out of control.

But my guess is that now it's warmer and I'm no longer hiding under baggy sweaters, my weight loss I more obvious. \n\nAnyway, people have been making off handed comments about my weight every now and again, but no one has actually been straight with me about it. Well, one of my friends texted me telling me she had a conversation with some other grad students and apparently the whole department has been talking about my weight and they're worried for me and she basically asked if I was ok. I guess I just don't see why it's such a big deal to everyone. I'm not that small, there are easily others who have to be close to my BMI. But apparently I'm the one who gets singled out?\n\nI'm not upset with my friend for being forward, I know she's typically not a confrontational person so it probably took some strength on her end to actually say anything. I basically skated around the topic, telling her I know I've lost too much and I am trying to strike a healthy balance with weight and diet. \n\nBut here I am, Sunday night and the thought of going in tomorrow and seeing everyone KNOWING that they're talking about me freaks me tf out. I can't sleep because I don't want tomorrow to come. I feel sick, I don't want to talk to people. I'm terrified another person will ask me what's up or I'll be ambushed.

My task for this week is to try to eat a meal before 10am everyday, since my normal pattern is to carry my \u201cbreakfast\u201d around with me all day in an attempt to delay eating for as long as possible, and then only eating it if I really have to. What I think she\u2019s imagining is that I will experience a huge peak in distress while eating my meal and then less distress at other times. Therefore, she wants me to record how distressed I feel immediately before, during, and after eating this meal, I guess to demonstrate that the distress will go down over time. While that may be others\u2019 experience and that\u2019s completely valid, it\u2019s not mine, and I\u2019ve tried to explain this to her but she\u2019s not getting it. For me, the problem is more an overall feeling of constant distress knowing that I have to do this task, rather than feeling extremely distressed during the actual meals. Meaning that I feel pretty horrible all day knowing that I have to eat this meal, but I don\u2019t feel MORE horrible while I\u2019m eating the meal. So this week I\u2019ve had a huge increase in planning and checking behaviors, obsessing over food matters, guilt and shame, and ruminative thoughts overall, but I wouldn\u2019t say that these feelings peak at mealtimes. I don\u2019t feel like the exposure sheet is really measuring what we intend it to measure, because my distress level doesn\u2019t increase significantly with the physical act of eating. \n\nI\u2019m starting to feel like I don\u2019t have a real eating disorder since it seems like I would be more triggered by the actual act of eating if I did. If you can relate, can you suggest a better way to measure progression and improvement with this kind of task that isn\u2019t based on rating distress at mealtimes and instead measures over a broader period of time? Insight from anyone who\u2019s ED is highly related to OCPD/coping through control/perfectionism would be especially appreciated.

Which I realize sounds awful. And I know that any no illness is better than any other. But like when people are dealing with anorexia or any other eating disorder the person is actually treated like a sick person. I also know that pathologizing any behavior can make any person feel trapped, but damn sometimes I wish when I try to reach out about my binge eating that the response wouldnt just be \"make better choices\" or \"eat less.\" That people could understand that the fight to not eat like as much food as you can at once can be just as much as a mental struggle as it can be to make yourself eat if you're anorexic. Sorry again, because I know saying I wish I had someone else's mental illness makes me sound awful.

Along with this I\u2019m growing taller and look lanky and just overall hate it, I wanted to change it.\n\nSo around half a year ago I started recalling calories, just to see how much I was getting then after a month cracked down. I aimed for a number easy to get except family makes it difficult. Then I went more and more lower, gradually at first and wanted to go lower but when I tried it was close to impossible with family meals.\n\nI\u2019ve seen lots of things about EDs and part of me just thinks I\u2019m doing it for attention, that I\u2019m purposely doing this just to have an ED. I had the same thing with my depression, I started out just always thinking it\u2019s not real and I\u2019m only doing it so I know I have depression, like a status which sounds really bad because it is and that\u2019s what I thought. That\u2019s how I feel now. I feel I\u2019m just pushing it to have that title almost which sounds so horrible because it\u2019s not something to parade about and why I just feel shit about it. I don\u2019t want to fall into it but at the same time I\u2019m not trying any weight loss diets or techniques because i start it and then have no energy to complete it or the mindset.\n\nI\u2019ve attempted to throw up when I went too high and have a few times but not good at it, it further makes me think as well I\u2019m just pushing myself to have that idea I have an ED and I feel even more shit about it. Yet I\u2019ll look in the mirror and just see my stomach or if I sit down my thighs are huge, arms big and just overall look bad.\n\nI know this posts a mess and it sounds like I\u2019m one of those people that fake it for attention but right now I know my depression is real and how it started out thinking it wasn\u2019t so now I\u2019m worried that\u2019s what\u2019s gonna happen now.

I've been getting worse with my depression, I got my period and my only friend cancelled an outing I'd been looking forward to for a year. She also doesn't live in the same town anymore, and I feel pretty alone. I had to quit school, too. Everything is really hard right now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I'm sad and have no one else to go/talk to, I tend to gravitate towards my mom and follow her around like a lost puppy. My mom gets uncomfortable and kinda frustrated when I'm sad around her, so she naturally tends to avoid me at those times. My relationship with her is becoming more and more strained. My mom has BPD and had been manic for a while, but then she needed surgery for carpal tunnel, now she can't drive and there's a lot she's not allowed to do for a while. It really sucks for her, because she always has to keep herself super busy. She's had a rough week too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother thing is that she's hard of hearing. I'm very sensitive, and I'll irrationally feel ignored/neglected when she pretends she hears what I said and gives a bullshit answer, or when she doesn't hear intonation. She told me this morning she hates it when I 'make faces' when I disagree with her. I roll my eyes sometimes and I will try to stop doing that, but I feel a bit frustrated because there's a lot I disagree on with my mom, but when talking to her I always need to use the same voice and way of talking so she understands me. I feel like I can't easily vocalize annoyance/disagreement. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnywho, this morning I woke up in a shitty way and I'm on my period, so I wasn't feeling well. I was in the kitchen making tea when my mom said she'll be right back, she's going to the neighbor to ask if she can drive her this afternoon and do grocery shopping. After she left I thought of something I needed from the store, so I waited around, emptied the dish washer, washed new dishes because the machine sucks, cleaned up some more and made myself another cup of tea. My mom came back after more than 30 minutes, and I felt a bit frustrated because she said she'd be right back and she always pulls this shit. I didn't get the chance to ask her about the store yet, because she yeeted to the other side of the house for another 10 minutes. I was being all mopey and whatever so we got mad at each other and I started crying, which she can't stand. So she put on her fake tone of voice and literally said she'll 'ignore her own feelings and do whatever to make me happy, OK?', ya know.. IDK, I just never get anything genuine from her, just this kind of messed up sarcasm/self pity (I'm 10000% self pitying too, tbf). Like, I told her that I feel like I don't have anybody atm, that I feel fking lonely, while my mom rushes through the living room doing some fake tidying up and giving distant disingenuous answers. Then her client knocked on the front door and my crying ass had to quickly go to the other side of the house so she could invite him in. And then they left and she was gone again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFUCK, I am literally so frustrated at myself for being such a baby. I have myself to blame for losing all but one friend, it's not my mom's fault that I'm so lonely. It's so fucking sad, jesus. Anyone else have the biggest trouble communicating with their parents?

I started foregoing meals every so often, until my stomach would cringe and curl and digest itself. I came to like something about that pain in my gut that reminded me of Kyle. A familiar guilty pleasure I had experienced with my relapse the same time. Very quickly my lack of eating turned into not eating at all for days at a time sometimes I would be so fatigued from lack of energy and no sustenance that I would collapse on the floor drained of energy and white as a ghost. I'm not sure how or why it happened, but eating turned into a coping mechanism for me. The pain that my body felt accurately reflected what I was going through emotionally. I have been struggling with this problem for over a year now, and what I have noticed is, my eating habits have been permanently changed. Now, the only way my body can even accept food, is by binge eating for sometimes three days in a row, gorging myself until I'm sick. and then my appetite goes away for another week sometimes two or three weeks. I have never talked about this before, or even really looked at it as a disorder, but since the suicide I have lost a noticeable amount of weight, my behavior has changed, my routines have changed, my healthy lifestyle has gone to s***. I have lost ton of weight, I get sick when I do eat, and i get sick when I dont eat. I have no energy anymore except apparently when I'm trying to sleep... my anxiety is always on full alert putting me in a Perpetual state of shakey paranoia. My depression is getting worse I'm self-sabotaging myself, including self harm. isolating crying all the time, and on three occasions this year, I fainted, due to what I think was a lack of food and water. I found this wonderful place a few hours ago on the internet, I have read some of everyone's stories, I have soaked in some of the advice, and mentally noted some of the pitfalls some of you have faced. If anyone has any insight as to what is going on with me, that would be fantastic.

I'm a very athletic person, with a huge sweet tooth. I'm typically very good with my diet but have always suffered from Binge Eating Disorder. I had it under control for a long time, but recently made a large move back home with my parents where it has taken control again.\n\nA bit about my stats; I'm 24F, 5'3\". Before moving in with my parents again I was sitting at about 118-120lbs and 16% body fat.\n\nSince moving in January I have gone up to 130lbs and 19% BF. My binge eating seems to centre around happiness. If my life isn't in a good place I have no appetite, when I'm happy I just want to eat! I will literally eat perfectly all day from breakfast and while at work, then go home and find a good movie and eat four chocolate bars and two bags of gummy candy, once i start eating sweets I can't stop myself.\n\nI'm having difficulty controlling my BED and thought fasting may help. If I can't control my eating at home, I won't eat!\n\nMy plan would be an 16:8, starting eating at 7:00am (Post Workout meal) with my last meal ending around 3:00pm.\n\nHas anyone else tried to control something like this via fasting and how has it worked out?\n\nTL;DR Suffering from BED has caused weight gain and I'm curious if IF would help control it", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I've struggled with AN for 6 years now and I'm trying to make the decision whether to admit myself (or not) to IP treatment. The thing is, it feels impossible to see how \"bad\" things supposedly are. My parents and therapist are constantly telling me how thin they think I am, but I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s because it\u2019s true, if it\u2019s out of panic or if it\u2019s out of genuine concern. How do I overcome it to make the treatment decisions I need?\n\nBasically I\u2019ve come here to figure out whether their concerns are warranted. I\u2019ve just been scrolling through all these weight loss forums (ugh) and tbh, I was expecting to see people way thinner than me (aka with a lower BMI) but I was surprised to see that not a lot of posts came up. Now, I can't tell if it's because I'm at a concerningly low weight or if its because such posts either get banned/deleted or just simply don't exist. I know my BMI (16.5) is fairly low (I\u2019m 5 foot 9/F20) but I guess I\u2019ve been caught up in the \u201cugh i\u2019m so fat\u201d mindset for so long that I\u2019ve maybe lost sight of reality.\n\nLike I said, I'm here because I\u2019m currently considering going into IP treatment for AN. My intake appointment went really badly (the social worker I met told me \u201conly really sick people get beds in IP\u201d and \u201cbeds are for people with medical needs, not financial needs\u201d) but my own GP, therapist and psych all agree that I would benefit from IP treatment. Coincidentally, I got a call from said SW this morning and she said that she consulted with the program\u2019s medical team and they now agree that I belong in IP. I know I need to do this, but the fact that they\u2019re brandishing these really high weights in my face is a major deterrent, especially considering I don\u2019t really see anything wrong with my current weight and I would be mortified to ever be seen at the weight they say I \"need\" to be at. How concerned should I be about my weight/health, and any suggestions as to what I can do to escape this mindset to make the recovery choices I need to make to get my life back?", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}
