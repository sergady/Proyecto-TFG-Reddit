How has it progressed and changed over the years? How has it impacted your life overall? Can you envision a future where you are healthy and happy, or do you think this is pretty much how it will always be? And do you feel like you are far behind people your age who have not had an ED/mental health issues?\n\n\nI\u2019m fast approaching 31 and all of these things are on my mind, and I guess I\u2019m just wondering how my experience and situation compares to other ED people my age.\n\nLet\u2019s see if I can keep my own story short and to the point-ish (lol nope. Knowing me this will be a novel. I\u2019m getting it all out for my own sake more than anything else, so feel free to skip over  the following word vomit. But please answer for yourself if you feel comfortable sharing. I really could use some perspective here.)\n\n\n\n\n\nI became anorexic at age 17. I was pretty much a perfect candidate for an ED (abusive/unstable family life, perfectionist, star student, obsessive, anxious, long history of self destructive/self injurious behaviour, etc), but I think what fully triggered it was just all the uncertainty over my future\u2014 being a senior in high school and having people ask me every single day without fail what college I planned to go to and what I was going to major in. I had vague ideas of what I wanted to do, none of which were good enough for my father, who told me that I had the choice to become either a doctor or a lawyer (while I am smart enough to have been able to go to law or med school in theory, I lack the stomach/backbone for those particular careers). So my teachers would ask what I was going to do and my answer was always \u201cI\u2019m going to law school...I guess.\u201d (Spoiler alert: I never made it to law school. I barely even graduated with my BA after six years because I went batshit fucking crazy.) To top it all off, my closest friends screwed me over terribly (all orchestrated by one girl in the bunch who I am fairly certain was a sociopath, in hindsight).\n\nSo I was feeling pretty scared and lost and alone. I took a nutrition course and finally learned about how weight gain/loss works, calories, micro and macro nutrients, etc. I was taught how to calculate my BMR/TDEE and BMI. I was quite intrigued by the notion that if I restricted my intake to x amount per day, I would lose y amount per week. I was naturally underweight to begin with, but I still wanted to test it out for two reasons: first, my abusive mother is morbidly obese and I wanted to prove to myself that if I ever did start gaining weight, I\u2019d be able to control myself enough to not end up like her. And second, with my life and future being so full of chaos and uncertainty, I was desperate for something concrete to hold onto. I wanted the formula to work so that I could prove to myself that at least there\u2019s something in the world that is constant, and that makes sense to me.\n\nI wasn\u2019t trying to \u201ccatch\u201d an ED. It never even crossed my mind. It was just supposed to be an experiment. I wanted to lose two pounds\u2014that\u2019s all, nothing major, just enough to see for myself that the formulas I had learned were correct, and that there are indeed a few things in life that are certain and predictable.\n\nWell, I lost the two pounds. It felt like some semblance of order had been restored to my world. Finally something had actually gone to plan. It was comforting, and I found myself unwilling/unable to stop. So...I didn\u2019t stop. And the rest is history.\n\nFreshman year of college I decided to seek help. I was still young, still had some hope in a future for myself. I got myself into treatment without any help from my parents\u2014in fact, I never even told them I was in treatment. As far as they were concerned, I was just being a stupid petulant child on a diet, there was no problem, I just needed to stop the bullshit because \u201cit\u2019s not fair to them!!!!!\u201d My treatment team all wanted me IP, but that wasn\u2019t an option because of my parents. Eventually I stopped seeing my dietician and physician, but continued with therapy for around seven years (again, with no help or involvement from my parents).\n\nI was purely a restricting anorexic until 19 or 20, when I started to b/p. Throughout the entirety of my ED restricting has been my main issue, but I went through b/p phases of varying intensity until I was around 24 (haven\u2019t purged at all since then, hooray for small victories I guess). \n\nWhen I was 25, certain circumstances in my life began to improve. Not a lot, but enough that I felt like life was finally giving me a break, and as such I felt obligated to at least make an attempt to be a Real Live Girl. By 26, my ED was pretty much in remission. Sometimes if something set me off, I\u2019d restrict for a few days or weeks, but eventually I\u2019d snap out of it.\n\nED behaviours started ramping up again more regularly over the last couple of years, and I\u2019d say I fully relapsed back inDecember of last year (age 30). And now here I am, back on my bullshit.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed some differences between my ED now vs my ED the first time around. The main difference is that (at least for now) I don\u2019t have any fear foods or safe foods. Before, I was deathly afraid of fat\u2014 I would not allow myself more than 10g of fat per day under any circumstances unless I was purging. Now, idgaf. I have a general calorie goal I try to stay under, but it doesn\u2019t matter at all to me where those calories come from. Salad and rice and lean proteins? Great. Chocolate and ice cream and chips? No problem, as long as i don\u2019t exceed x amount of calories. I think there was an element of orthorexia when I was first anorexic, but not so much anymore. (Although now when I am heavily restricting, I pretty much only eat rice, eggs, and veg. But that\u2019s more out of a lack of desire/effort than fear or crazy rules.)\n\nI also don\u2019t freak out so much if I go over. I mean, I do. I get pissed at myself and berate myself and all that good stuff, but it doesn\u2019t feel like the end of the world like it used to. I fucked up today (and yesterday, and the day before)? Well of course I did, I\u2019m a fat fucking failure loser piece of shit who deserves to die, but hey, I can and will do better tomorrow. Take a fucking Xanax and go to sleep, it\u2019s fine.\n\nI used to plan out my \u201cmeals\u201d meticulously and if anything happened to fuck up my plans, I\u2019d have an absolute meltdown. Now? Boss puts food on my desk and tells me to eat it, I eat it. It wasn\u2019t part of my plan, but I\u2019m flexible, I can adjust accordingly. Boss wants me to go with her to get ice cream because she\u2019s pissed off at everyone else in the office and ready to kill someone? Ehhhh I really am trying to cut out sugar and dairy completely, but I can live with one scoop. I just won\u2019t eat the snacks I brought with me. I\u2019ll make it work.\n\nIn some ways this is a good thing, because I can at least pretend to be normal, and it\u2019s much easier to cover up the fact that I\u2019m relapsing (no one expects an anorexic to sit down and eat pizza or ice cream without kicking up a fuss). People see me eat shitty food and they just assume my weight loss is unintentional, a fluke. I don\u2019t have to listen to anyone\u2019s shit this way.\n\nOn the other hand, I really miss the structure of my old system. I miss having rules, knowing the rules, sticking to the rules and feeling comforted and accomplished by doing so. My ED is meant to help me cope with the chaos, but at the moment my ED is in a state of chaos itself. There are no rules and that makes me uneasy. I want to make rules, but that\u2019s not how this works. My ED makes the rules and I follow them, at least that\u2019s how it used to go. But that\u2019s not happening now, and I can\u2019t figure out why. It\u2019s fucking frustrating.\n\nAs far as how it\u2019s affected my life/my growth as a person...lololol. I\u2019m 31 years old but I am an absolute child. I\u2019m more mature than my peers in certain ways (interests, hobbies, values, and I get along much better with people who are a few decades older than me) but functionally, career-wise, and relationship-wise, not so much. \n\nI am 100% financially dependent on my parents (I suppose it bodes well for me that while they could never be bothered to actually parent me, their idea of being good parents has essentially always been to just throw money my way in exchange for not having to actually deal with me). I\u2019ve only ever had a couple of jobs, making barely above minimum wage (I am a hard worker and capable of much more, but being fucked in the head has severely limited my options). I can technically drive, but refuse to do so unless absolutely necessary. I go weeks without getting my mail or paying my bills. I don\u2019t know what to do when something in my house breaks. I don\u2019t know what to do when most anything goes wrong, really. I can\u2019t figure out how to handle normal, everyday things that are just part of being an adult. So I end up either calling my parents and listening to them bitch about how useless I am, or call my boss and cry until she feels sorry enough for me to help me with whatever the problem is. It\u2019s pathetic. I have absolutely no clue how to interact with people beyond a superficial level, and it\u2019s near impossible for me to develop/maintain relationships of any kind. Granted, most of this is probably due more to my anxiety than ED, but at the end of the day it\u2019s all connected in one way or another.\n\nI just feel like...idk. I am an outcast for sure compared to \u201cnormal people\u201d, but I also feel like an outcast even within the ED community. Like I am literally the only person who cannot keep my shit together at all. I see so many people (here and in other ED settings) who are sick, but still somehow manage to be at least moderately successful, have friends, a relationship, kids. Meanwhile, I\u2019m a total basket case who needs hand holding to do even the most basic shit. I guess I\u2019m just wondering if anyone can relate to that? (And I\u2019m also genuinely curious about the long term progression and effects of EDs, as that\u2019s not something you hear much about.)", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

This is still considered eating..?\n\nI'm not sure.. but maybe this whole thing is getting worse. I recently started to look up thinspo, i didn't knew it was a thing before. Most of the websites block these kind of things but i found out there is a really toxic side of Twitter with a lot of ed accounts. And now i can't stop looking at that, keep looking up pro ana &amp; thinspo related things..", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

TW. \nWhen I started losing weight I was 350. 5\u20198\u201d. I\u2019m ftm. This was around 2 1/2-3 years ago, right after high school. All the way up to this time I was a chronic binge eater/emotional eater, however I didn\u2019t realize that was my problem. I was just fat and I have been my whole life and was tired of it. Started looking into losing weight, and learned about calories. I counted my calories one day and it was WAY above what an average person should eat and freaked me the fuck out so I stopped doing that. So then I went vegetarian. Told everyone it was for the animals but really just wanted an excuse to say no to food. I gained weight, so I went vegan. More excuses to eat less. I lost weight but got stuck. So I started counting again and never stopped. I also became obsessed with diet culture. Instagram and YouTube weight loss bloggers became my life. I tried every diet, even gave up veganism after a year and did keto (but gave up because I was pescatarian and couldn\u2019t really keep up with it). I ended up finding MPA and ED tumblr by searching for weight loss tips. My dumb ass thought \u201coh yeah! It would be a great idea to not eat for three-five days! I\u2019m fat enough to survive!\u201d I started out \u201chealthy\u201d fasting and taking all of the precautions. ended up in fast/binge/restrict cycles. I didn\u2019t realize what I was doing until the fasting turned to purging and lax and feeling like death all the time. Told myself I need to fix myself and stop doing all of this. But I can\u2019t stop thinking about losing weight anymore. I wish I could be how I used to be, try a diet for a week and just forget about it or give up. Instead I\u2019m stuck with everlasting food guilt, an awful body with tons of loose skin from losing weight too fast &amp; in an unhealthy way, and yo-yoing. I\u2019m in the 160s now and have been for months. And I can\u2019t explain the turmoil and frustration I\u2019m in now that it\u2019s so hard to lose weight. I feel like my body and metabolism is ruined for the rest of my life. My attempts at \u201crecovery\u201d just gave me an excuse to binge and pick at foods 24/7 that I wouldn\u2019t eat before. And I just kept back into either fasting or purging. Trying to just exercise to make up for what I eat and I use my Fitbit to keep myself on track but it can be hard when ur so depressed.. I\u2019m tired of feeling like shit, and even more tired of always being so fat. I don\u2019t even think I have an ED because I feel like I eat too much and don\u2019t purge or fast or do anything long or right enough to lose weight. I feel completely out of control of myself.

Last spring, I decided I wanted to lose a little weight for a wedding I was attending. \n\nOut came good ol\u2019 My Fitness Pal, and by tracking my calories, I was able to lose the weight I wanted. When I did, I had never felt better about myself. I was more confident and proud of myself for what I had accomplished. I kept tracking calories and weighing myself, which lead to me saying, \u201cI want to lose just a few more pounds.\u201d\n\nEnter the restricting and binging cycle. At first I would just feel guilty eating a few extra treats, but it slowly turned into binges. I was at my worst last fall, eating so much in secret at night until I felt so sick I couldn\u2019t sleep. The guilt the next day was tremendous. \n\nAs school started up, I probably told myself a 10000 times, \u201cOK. diet starts tomorrow and i\u2019ll track calories again.\u201d I wanted to lose the weight I had gained from the binges the same way I lost it in the first place. Because when I lost it I found it all relatively unproblematic. But I honestly hate tracking calories. It makes me food obsessive, and I get mad feeling like I have to restrict so much. So then comes another binge. \n\nAround Christmas, I said \u201cscrew it\u201d and just ate whatever the hell I wanted but told myself I wouldn\u2019t binge because I could eat whatever I wanted. This put me at my heaviest weight. \n\nI used to love working out; my days didn\u2019t feel right if I didn\u2019t in the morning. But since that Christmas, I haven\u2019t wanted to exercise at all. I ended up dealing with the whole gym anxiety thing where you think you look so fat and everyone knows it. \n\nI just want a healthy relationship with food. Sometimes I feel so dumb because who the heck doesn\u2019t know how to just eat. The problem is, I still want to lose this weight i\u2019ve gained in the past year.

No matter what I tried, I couldn't get it back in its place, and after waiting three and half hours my face was cramping so bad I couldn't take it and I couldn't speak and even swallowing was tough, so I went to the ER where a dentist managed to put it back in its place. \n\nAfterwards we discussed the measures I should take to avoid this happening in the future, and she told me that repetitive movement from too much chewing could cause this, or at the very least worsen the condition if you have a predisposition to it, and told me to ditch gum and chewy candy altogether (side note: she also told me that I should avoid taking large bites and cut my food in small pieces.

I've had an eating disorder for about 3 years now, starting off with bulimia which then developed into BED, which I have to this day.\n\nThe disordered eating for me started as a way of trying to control my body - the dysphoria was uncontrollable, maybe I could super-control my weight and feel good about myself that way instead? - and then lead to just escaping it through food. If I felt bad about my body, I could just blame being fat instead of having to think about the dysphoric body issues. But obviously that's not sustainable, and it quickly ended up making me feel much worse overall (as I'm sure plenty of you will understand). \n\nOver the last 2-3 months in particular, it reaaally got out of control because I had my A level exams, which are qualifications in the UK that determine whether or not you go to university. This extra stress on top of my depression and dysphoria just fed the BED. \n\nAnd here I am. 12kg (27lbs) heavier than I was 3 months ago, 7kg (16lbs) overweight and a sweet 19kg (40lbs) away from my goal weight. What started off as just needing to lose like 3-4lbs has turned into being very overweight and much further from my goal.\n\nI am dieting and exercising regularly, and I'm hoping that this \"journal\" thing will help me to deal with the emotions that drive me to bingeing, so I start properly losing the weight instead of exercising and then bingeing all those burned calories back.

I can tell he's struggling.\n\n\nOn the first day of the gym, he weighed himself with the fancy gym scale and found out his BMI is 26; you could tell he was upset by this. Since then he's focused more on what he's eating. He told me the other day that he feels bad when he eats because he feels he's fat and he hates his body. Before he eats anything that would be considered unhealthy he always goes up to me and asks if I'll judge him for it (I always say no). He goes to the gym and tells me he's \"burnt off his snacks for the day\" and so he feels better.\n\n\nHe gets upset when we go to the gym and he hasn't lost any weight, and I think he's comparing himself to me (which, when I'm 5'4 and he's 6'3, isn't reasonable). He looks at the amount I lose each week and I feel that he gets upset that he isn't losing anything or isn't losing as quickly as he wants to.\n\n\nI had a talk with him a couple of weeks ago where I expressed my concern over his self consciousness with his weight. He told me worrying things like how he's felt out of control while eating something and felt like he's eaten \"too much\", so when he goes to the gym he burns the calories he feels guilty for until he feels better. I explained to him that that could be a form of bulimia and just because he isn't throwing up that doesn't mean he isn't purging.\n\n\nThen earlier on today I discovered he downloaded MFP again when he said he probably wouldn't do. When I asked him why he downloaded it he said \"I guess I'm becoming more obsessed\". To me that sounds like a cry for help. I feel like he's slowly slipping into a hole and I'm not sure what to do next, especially because I'm struggling with issues myself. Telling him to stop or insisting that what he's doing is really bad would be hypocritical, and I know it wouldn't do anything anyway.\n\n\nI'm not even sure I should be worried.

It's a horrendous cycle with an underlying issue that I simply cannot identifiy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have always been able to eat upwards of 3k calories a day. I am 6'4\" and 280lbs. Yesterday I went downtown to watch a magic show and I just wore shorts and birkenstocks and the only clean blue vneck I had. As I sat on the metro and looked at my side reflection whilst sweating my nuts off in the window, I saw something I didn't recognize. I saw myself. I saw the true disconnect between the image of who I was last April and who Funk33 is 5 days before his 30th birthday. I made a joke with my roommate of how, \"I am the walrus, coo coo coochoo\", however I truly felt that inside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is a bit on the heavier side, and I've always directed my faults and failings with my own weight by trying to help her correct her bad habits. Of course she will take it as an attack and dismiss my claims. I don't blame her. Who I am I to tell her what to do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am rambling and I understand if this has no coherence like a good post, but I need to get this out in a community that understands. I have felt stupid in the last few months. Complete brain fog, libido all over the place (to the chagrin of my wife), constantly snacking and eating, lacking awareness of my daily habits. Allowing my ADD to run rampant and let me not focus on anything at all, until I hyperfocus and spend a shit tonne of money on a hobby then ignore it for a month before I look at it again because all I do is sleep eat, eat, eat, watch youtube videos and think of how muscular and fit I was 6 years prior to where I am now because facebook reminded me.  \n\n\nLast year I lost 50lbs. I was getting skinny again. Started a new office job, found a lovely woman, and then drank and ate. I was living with my grandma eating 1200 calories a day, trying to look perfect. I have no patience for the long grind. I need the results now. Now it appears I don't give a flying fuck. I had a sausage mcmuffin and hashbrown this morning as I dropped my wife off to her work. Then drank half the mcdonalds coffee and came home and made another coffee. Then I passed out. Woke up and ate two smokies on toasted bread buttered with boursin cheese. Took out the garbage, and then came back and devoured an entire can of pringles. Jerked it twice then painted models for about two hours, then chilled out and just another smokie (uncooked of course), two more pieces of toast with shredded cheese on it, then I made some ramen and just finished eating this and realised what a problem I have.  \n\n\nI feel myself slowly giving up, believe the fact that I have forgone my bulimia for binge eating without the puking as a success. I still have an issue. I've gained 70lbs within 15 months. I became the very person I've mocked before. I think I'm better because I used to be fit and I know what it's like. I think I'm better and more intelligent than the vast majority of people in existence. I have so much ego and get frustrated whenever people point that out. I respect boundaries until it doesn't serve me. I allow my anxiety to flair and use it to be an introvert and not really put myself out there and form relationships so I can have strong friendships. I don't allow myself to really feel anything, and I just consume as an emotion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI need to achieve normalcy with food, because while life can be weird, I need a sense of control and I want to be healthy for the remainder of my life so I can live past my 40's and 50's.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading, I have not blown up like that in quite a long time. No throwaway either because hiding is what brought me here in the first place.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

But in summer 2018 I began to gain... a lot more weight than I wanted.  So in November I started working out.  I didn't weigh myself; but in April I had to go to the doctors and saw that I gained weight :( I had a huge break down. I tried working out even harder and eating healthier, though tried not to exceed 1200 calories (which had worked previously in 2013 when I was 200lbs and lost 80).  I measured and weighed myself about a week ago... i gained even more weight, and only lost weight in my hips (0.7inches); everything else got slightly bigger. To make matters worse... a bridesmaid dress I had ordered in no longer fit me... and when I took it into a tailor she said \"Oh Wow\" which of course made me feel like shit. \n\nI tried going to a weightloss center, and they said they couldn't help me due to only being \"slightly\" overweight... they just told me to do the stuff I've already been doing.

Coupled with (undiagnosed) anxiety and depression, it\u2019s the only thing I feel like I have full \u201ccontrol\u201d over. Restricting and losing weight makes me feel like I\u2019m productive and accomplished in something, even if it could ultimately hurt me. I\u2019m 5\u20195 1/2 and I weighed about 138-140 lbs last winter (January 2019) and now I\u2019m down to 110 lbs. So I\u2019ve lost ~30 lbs in the past 5-6 months. Some people have expressed concern over my sudden weight loss, while others have praised it. To the ones who are worried, I try to shrug it off and say I\u2019m just eating healthier and exercising more, and that generally works to stop the questions for a while.  \n\nProblem is my goal weight keeps getting lower. At first I just wanted to get back to my pre-child weight (128 lbs) which I felt fairly confident and thin at before; then when I reached that I wanted to hit 120, then 114, then 110 and now my brain is telling me I need to lose another 5 lbs as a buffer \u201cjust in case\u201d. When does it stop?? I feel my newer clothes getting baggier already; I know logically I\u2019m pretty thin, and I sometimes \u201csee\u201d it for a split second in the mirror but then I suddenly see all my gross flaws and it\u2019s like I get bigger the longer I stare at myself.\n\nI almost convinced myself to tell my husband about my disordered eating (he works so much that I really don\u2019t think he notices my weird eating habits), but I\u2019m getting the feeling he likes me being this thin.

I don\u2019t really want to talk to him about it anymore and I\u2019ve lost all motivation to do so.\n\nUgh, I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m trying to accomplish here.

The past week has been pretty bad. My treatment team is not. Helping. \n\nTw: talking about purging, voicing eating disorder thoughts, idk\n\nARFID is the real bitch this time, and my therapist doesn\u2019t know shit about how to treat it. It\u2019s really bad; I\u2019ve been skipping lots of meals and snacks. I purged twice, which had nothing to do with weight or calories. After an ARFID-challenging-meal, the food scares me so much that it just being IN my body makes me panic, and I want it OUT. Before this, I hadn\u2019t purged in almost two months. \n\nIt\u2019s frustrating. It\u2019s frustrating that my throwing up is framed as bulimia, when the throwing up is mostly due to ARFID and a sensitive stomach, and I don\u2019t binge. The center\u2019s therapist does not understand that overeating/binging is incredibly rare for me. She\u2019s led a few groups about overeating, compulsive eating, and binging, which where super triggering for me, and she didn\u2019t really listen or understand when I talked about it. Binge eating is a serious problem and I don\u2019t mean to be insensitive, but god, right now, I would love to be able to overeat. I\u2019m so fucking hungry 24/7 and I can\u2019t eat enough thanks to motherfucking ARFID. Being full is such a luxury to me. \n\nFor me, ARFID triggers anorexia, and it\u2019s a vicious cycle. \n\nARFID: I don\u2019t want to eat. I\u2019m going to eat minimally and/or skip meals. \n\nAnorexia: Oh, perfect! You know what we\u2019ve learned? If you go a long time without eating, you lose your appetite. \n\nARFID: Wow, then I wouldn\u2019t even have to worry about food. \n\nARFID: I can\u2019t eat anything else, but I could eat ice cream \n\nAnorexia: ha ha ha slow down there buddy do you know about the calories in ice cream? \n\nMe: what if I had an ensure for the nutrients and ice cream because I like it??\n\nARFID: you\u2019re a failure, you\u2019re so abnormal, you can\u2019t even have normal meals, you\u2019ll always be left out when other people are eating\n\nAnorexia: uhhhh but it\u2019d be SO EASY to just NOT eat anything and THE CALORIES (and if you\u2019re gonna be weird and left out you could at least be skinny!)\n\nMe: :( \n\nSo yeah. I haven\u2019t ate much. I\u2019m hungry as fuck. I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m hopeless. ARFID hasn\u2019t gotten any better since I started treatment. In fact, it\u2019s gotten harder to deal with. Before I just didn\u2019t eat, so I didn\u2019t have to deal with it. It\u2019s scary. I know that this combination of ARFID and anorexia can make me lose weight and become malnourished and just lose control of my life really really quickly.

Why is no one calling out the fact that a 116 lb girl fasted for 5 days? Like shouldn\u2019t someone say \u201chey maybe don\u2019t post this because it\u2019s unhealthy\u201d? I get that people on this sub might do similar lengths of fasting at lower weights like her, but at least we aren\u2019t trying to hide the fact that it\u2019s probably not the healthiest thing to do. We can acknowledge that it maybe be effective for immediate results but it definitely is not healthy for all weights. The difference is that THAT SUB preaches how healthy they are for just drinking salt water for 30 days and losing weight. Okay so it works to quickly lower weight when people are obese and overweight, but why are they okay with it when it goes into her being underweight? \n\nAND THE WORST PART IS that they\u2019re all like \u201cwell she doesn\u2019t look underweight\u201d HOLY FUCKING TRIGGER. I HATE THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BMI OF LIKE 2 FOR PEOPLE TO ACCEPT YOU HAVE AN EATING DISORDER. Not saying that she does, but I think you guys get what I\u2019m saying? Idk it just really triggered me.\n\nBut hey, maybe I\u2019m just jealous because I\u2019m the same age and same height as her and I once weighed 108 at the worst point of my ED, when my hair was falling out, I was freezing all the fucking time, I couldn\u2019t sit in chairs in class without my butt hurting really badly, and someone I barely knew told me I had gotten \u201cfreakishly skinny\u201d. But apparently none of that matters because being 5\u20195 and 108 doesn\u2019t even look underweight. So maybe I was just being a weak bitch when I weighed that much and I didn\u2019t have the mental strength to maintain that weight or even lower it. \n\nSince that point in my life, I\u2019ve developed BED, getting to 140 lbs at one point. Now, I run every day, weigh/track all my food, and made it down to 120 lbs. But it took me a fucking year and a half to break the cycle of daily binges. And I don\u2019t even feel completely stable, I could lose control at any moment. I still binge a few times a week. I went to the ER twice, went through countless therapists, and missed so much school because I couldn\u2019t handle my eating normally. It\u2019s been so hard and I know that I\u2019ll never be able to make it back down to 108. So maybe that\u2019s why that post bothered me. But obviously it triggered the fuck out of me and I needed to rant.\n\nTLDR: i\u2019m *mildly* annoyed. apparently having disordered eating habits is normal and healthy if you look hot!!", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

It started off rough, depression^(TM) was acting up a lot, but it didn't last too long and I was able to deal with it. I've also worked out twice today (once cardio, once strength), and my legs feel like freakin noodles lol but I'm proud of myself for finishing the workouts. \n\nOne thing I HAVE found is that when I exercise, I should NOT add those burned calories to my intake or that leads to a binge 99% of the time. I'm on 1200kcal (I am a short human.) and in the past if I burned, say, 400 calories exercising, then I'd put my intake up to 1600. But I stopped doing that and am sticking to just 1200, which in my experience is helping to calm the urges.\n\nLast night was difficult as I couldn't sleep, even after taking 2 sleeping pills I was lying awake for hours and the urge to binge was *strong*. I'm happy to say I was able to resist that urge! (maybe partly coz I was too damn tired to move, hahaha. But a win is a win) I know it's not going to be easy in the future and that there will be times where the urge will be WAY worse, but I'm still glad I didn't relapse.\n\nI am going out with mates later and part of me is excited, but another part of me is REALLY not looking forward to it because there will be pizza. Pizza is honestly one of my biggest weaknesses. I'm going to try to be as strict as possible and limit myself to 4-5 slices, so as to avoid overeating. I hope I can stick to that, because otherwise this could go south reaaal fast. I'll let you know how it went tomorrow :)", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

Often there are other reasons besides just the desire to look a certain way. And yes even when people with an ED hit their goal weight they will probably keep going because at that point it\u2019s a compulsion. but seriously..... if you think eating disorders can't be motivated by the desire to look a certain way / that they don't often start out like that (even though it may quickly become about control or be fed by anxiety and other issues) you are just so ignorant and clearly just read the Wikipedia article for anorexia nervosa and now think you are an expert. \n\nIt almost feels like a way to take the blame off of society. Girls aren\u2019t starving themselves because being underweight is now seen as the standard, they\u2019re starving themselves because they have no control at home! There\u2019s nothing we as a society can do about those crazy anorexics because they\u2019re just doing it for other reasons! They just want control! \n\nLike....how can you not see the damage that you\u2019re all doing. There\u2019s a reason that ED rates have gone up so much in recent years with the advent of Instagram and shit, and as beauty standards have shifted and we are surrounded by pictures of women who are underweight who we have no hope of looking like, and then have men calling healthy women fat and underweight women sexy and healthy. \n\nBut no it\u2019s just about control and we don\u2019t even care about our bodies or what we look like. So I guess you have no blood on your hands and continue to pretend like you care about people who are sick and that you think eating disorders are just so tragic and horrible while continuing to push more and more people down this path by exploiting their desire to fit in and be seen as acceptable.\n\nEDIT: I wasn't trying to say that it's all about vanity and wanting to look good because I know it's not either, but that is a big reason why it starts for many people and I am just sick of seeing extreme dieting and being underweight and tips to be skinny and blah blah blah promoted everywhere, even to young people and then have people wonder why ED rates are so high. This post was a direct response to a comment that I saw where someone was saying that fasting to get a certain look / to achieve a certain weight goal (in this case it was underweight) doesn't / can't lead to anorexia because \"anorexia is only about control and not about looking thin\" on a thread that was full of people congratulating an underweight girl because \"she looks healthy\" so I was just feeling really angry. I guess my post did sort of go to the other extreme and I apologize for that, for me it's the main motivation of my eating disorder and so I did sort of oversimplify it just because of my experience and because I had such a vehement reaction to the other dude being so ignorant about it", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Also, sorry for the long post.\n\nI'm worried I might have an ED. I've read articles from various sources explaining what they are and what the symptoms and 'criteria' for a particular diagnosis are...some things fit me, but honestly, most don't. I don't fit the stereotypes about people with EDs either. But I struggle with food so much sometimes, I can't help but think something must be wrong.\n\nI'm very prone to anxiety and have frequent highly depressive episodes, that have been known to veer into dangerous territories. So maybe my experiences are just further symptoms of that. When I get into these depressive periods of my life, I start to have these issues. I lose my appetite and have to force myself to eat. I'll eat the same few types of things for days, and then suddenly want to avoid those things for weeks. I stare in the mirror and think about how if I just waited, skipped a few meals until I was so hungry I had to eat, and even then ate as little as possible, maybe I'd lose weight. I've been told by several people recently that I've lost weight. I find myself looking at my body and thinking 'fat', reaching for snacks and either turning away with thoughts of how I'm heavy enough already or I guilt myself while I eat them, thinking that I'm a selfish pig. I feel good when I go without eating successfully, and feel secretly proud when I manage to 'forget' about eating for days. I can remember several times when I've pretended to friends that I'd just been so distracted and un-hungry as a reason for why I'd missed many meals to, knowing I was looking for validation I was doing a good thing. Other days though, I can't seem to eat enough to make the hunger go away.\n\nDoes this sound to you like symptoms of a potential ED? And if so - which one?

I decided I was going to walk to the vape shop and to the grocery. 4 miles, 2 bottles of Kombucha, and a fair amount of gin last night later let me just say oof. I stayed under my calorie goal just barely. I ate way too many carbs and no Soylent. So guess who woke up today shaky and feeling like crap? If you guessed me, well I'd offer a cookie but let's be real here. \n\nTake away so far, more Soylent and less cheating via pasta.

He has health (high blood pressure) issues that are somewhat related to his weight (he's on the heavier side, though not obese). He _needs_ to lose weight. And he knows and aknowledges it.

They even poke his stomach... \n\nI know this isn't about me and I shouldn't care, but it's extremely triggering to me that they treat him like that. It reminds me of my ED brain and of people at school telling me to stop existing because I was too fat. How do I deal with this? Should I bring up my ED to my in-laws?

Like just tell me \"yo eating while distracted is disconnecting you from your body and you won't recover as fast if at all\". Boom. This book is blunt but kind.\n\n\nI also REALLY recommend this book if you don't/can't get to a therapist. It is DEEP. It asks questions about the darkest part of this disorder and I'm loving it. I just go a page at a time. If I feel like doing 5 pages, great. If i need to marinate on a topic for 5 days before I move on, great. \n\n\nI am currently stunned by the statement that I need to eat adequately to stop the binge cycle. I've heard it from my shrink and my nutritionist but for some reason they way it's stated in the book it hit me like a ton of bricks. This happened because it has a question where you list and remember the details of all your diets and then asks \"do you eat from the hunger to come?\". Um why yes I do. The only time I had peace from this disorder AND lost weight was on WW 8 years ago. I preplanned my food and ate every 3 hours in a balanced manner and never deprived myself of a thing. I pre portioned candy for every single night, built in partying and ate out constantly. I have to feed myself adequately. \n\n\nFWIW I answer the questions in another notebook, I hate writing in my books.

It really started when I kept noticing at track meets and cross country meets that all the other girls were skinnier and looked so athletic. I have strong muscles and I'm a decent athlete but I still feel the same way. I do NOT want an eating disorder and the thought of having one develop scares me, but I also feel so much panic when I think about food. I either eat very healthily or not at all or I eat mass amounts of carbs. Help?", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I know that with the \"calorie in calorie out\" model of metabolism (which isn't accurate) it might seem that a few hundred or thousand calories extra will be detrimental, but the body adjusts sooo many different factors (your hunger level and cravings, how much it absorbs, how rapidly it will pass food through your digestive tract, your unconscious activity level / motivation to move, hormonal levels across multiple hormonal axes, whether it is willing to use energy towards \"extras\" like hair and skin or having a period) that literally... there is no point in trying to count. Eat less, either by intentionally skipping a meal or just because you accidentally were on the run? Your body will just hold on to more. If you overeat, you'll just be slightly less hungry for your next meal.

I lost over 20 pounds in a year a no one noticed. No one gives a shit, and when they do it's only to make jokes about how skinny I am, or how I don't eat because I am on a \"diet\".\nEveryone in my family is ow. \nI was called a skeleton, an ASPIRING MODEL, yeah because if someone starves themselves is because they want to be a model, of fucking course. \nAt the moment I really want to do this on my own until I am 18, but I don't know if I can go on for other 4/5 months. \n\nSo, sorry for the rant, how did you tell your parents about your ED if they didn't notice on their own?", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Just whenever I had just a liiiittle too much to eat, just when I couldn't stand the feeling of being full.

Like... I enjoy and want people to be comfortable and healthy in their bodies no matter the type of body because everyone is beautiful... And then I find myself purging a big mac bc I just cannot let myself gain weight. I am overweight tho, 75kg. So I'm in a sort of limbo where I want to lose 25kg more and also want to love my chub and accept myself how I am. Is it just me? Sorry if this breaks a rule or something!!!

She has been struggling and dieting since i can remember. She had been extreme dieting lat year and lost a bunch of weight(good for her, i love that she's happy) but i can't ignore the fact that a) it was an extremely unhealthy way. a crazy caloric deficit that absolutely no dietician would allow b) she wants to maintain an underweight state. She is terrified of gaining and panics every time she notices a slight change in weight or eats something \"unhealthy'. And ofc it passed down to me. Living with her has been so extremely triggering i don't know how long i can handle it. I try keeping my cool but it's really hard. Trying to calm her down that a handful of prunes won't make her gain weight while i haven't eaten anything in 53 hours? constantly trying to convince her that water weight is nothing serious while secretly taking laxatives myself? l think i'm going crazy. I have tried encouraging her to eat, lying(ik, ik) about caloric amounts in foods just so i can get her to eat. But the most fucked up thing by far is the fact that we both know the other one is skipping meals, or eating too little, and are just ignoring it. I can not eat for a day, and she wouldn't even notice because she does the same too. it's so toxic and unhealthy but i can't do anything about it. How can i tell her anything while i'm literally doing twice worse than her? Every time she has mentioned the word 'anorexia' in a conversation it just sent chills down my spine.

It's supposed to be a healthier way to fast and not cause muscle wasting like water fasting does.  I also take supplements so I get electrolytes. I'm not sure how healthy it really is, there's so much conflicting advice and pseudoscience around nutrition but it's making me lose weight quickly which is all I really care about. \n\nAll i get in fasting forums is encouragement, but when I tell people in real life they are usually quite shocked.

I was a student. a stay at home mom. my ex husband was my rock. I felt taken care of.

And I won't have those truly disgusting sugar alcohol farts tonight and tomorrow.\n\n**I didn't think I would ever be able to eat ice cream like a normal person.** I thought that even if I controlled my binging, I'd still have urges to eat full pints of ice cream, and I thought I'd spend the rest of my life just trying to fight intense desires to eat. I'm so proud of how far I've come.\n\nA brief synopsis of how I stopped binging, if anyone is interested:\n\n* I stopped counting calories **and** I stopped weighing myself **and I stopped worrying about my weight at all, even if I thought I was gaining,** The goal now was to stop binging, not to lose weight. You will keep binging if you don't give your body enough food.\n* I listened to my body (not to a calorie counter, not to the time of day, and not to other people around me) to decide when I was hungry and when I was full. I ate when I was hungry, whenever I was hungry. At first, I couldn't even tell when I was hungry and when I was full, but my hunger signals slowly returned.\n* I ate what I wanted to eat, even if it was too much food or it wasn't healthy food. **I didn't beat myself up** about anything relating to food: eating too much, eating something \"bad,\" eating out, feeling bloated or fat, not exercising as much as I thought I should, etc.\n* I re-introduced foods I had stopped eating in my restriction or things I only ate during a binge, like real butter (salted Kerrygold is an absolute tongue orgasm on toast), full-fat cheese, pizza, and **actual fucking PB&amp;amp;J sandwiches with normal bread, normal jelly, and normal peanut butter.**\n* I didn't give up, even when recovery wasn't feeling good, like when I was gaining weight and wanting so badly to restrict to counteract it. I moved past binges. A binge doesn't equal a failure; stopping binge eating doesn't happen overnight or even in a week or two. Commit for the long haul to feed your body what it needs, no restriction.\n\nOne thing they don't tell you about recovery: I poop so much, you guys. I poop every day, sometimes twice a day! It's such a joy, tbh. And it's normal poop, not massive gross binge logs or tiny restriction deer nuggets. I love it.\n\nEDIT: another thing I did when I started my recovery was I STOPPED LOOKING AT 1200isplenty because it\u2019s hella NOT plenty for me and was encouraging me to restrict and then binge. I stopped reading most of the eating disorder subs, actually.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I have an internship at a dream company making video games as a concept artist, I have a boyfriend who is going to propose to me next year, a family that is the most supportive and loving anyone could ever ask for, sibling who I'm very close to and he looks up to me as a role model, friends that love me unconditionally (and friends that have been with me for more than a decade), I own a successful art business where I get to freelance my own art and sell to the masses, graduating next year from a college that is in the top three in the world for game design as a top student, I get to travel somewhere new in the world almost every year thanks to the people in my life, awesome connections with people all over the world who keep in contact with me..... And I feel like I'm living a lie sometimes. \n\nTo everyone else I'm a model student, daughter, entrepreneur, whatever. But I hide behind a history of depression, suicidal behaviors, anorexia, orthorexia, binging and purging, self harm, insomnia, ect. I feel like my 'bad self' is something precious and secret to me though. In my head I'm like \"I'm pretty much all anyone can ask for on the outside, I need to keep just one thing for myself\" and that 'one thing' is my ED right now. The further I fall into my ED the more I need to strive for excellence and success in my outer life. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I love my career and the people around me. I wouldnt ask for any other life. But I need my ED for some reason. \n\nLike, I have such a strict military like discipline on myself that feeds into my personal ED life and outer social/professional life. And it's a miracle that I haven't broken yet. For example, I won't let myself faint in public even if I'm on day 3 of fasting, I won't allow myself to skip more than 2 days without going to the gym or exercising, I won't let anything I deem 'unsafe' to pass my lips, I was vegetarian for years because I had decided one day I decided meat was unhealthy, I fast once a week without fail. \n\nI'm scared sometimes that because I walk such a thin line that one day I will collapse and my ED will become all consuming to the point I give up my other life. \n\nIDK, is anyone else super high functioning? I don't know why I posted this, I guess I just read a lot of posts about people struggling with their life outside of their ED and I feel bad because it must be so difficult to deal with that on top of a debilitating disorder. Meanwhile I'm here all 'successful' and shit and actively ruining my 'perfect' life by refusing to let go of my ED. Just wanted to know if there are others like me. \n\nThanks for reading if you got to the end.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I'm overweight, I have depression and anxiety, I have high blood pressure, and I have type 2 diabetes which creates more problems like nerve pain/damage, kidney damage, and slow healing wounds. I used to weigh over 500 lbs and I lost 100 of those lbs and have been hovering at the same weight for 9 years. I always fluctuate about 10 lbs over or below, but my weight has been the same. I've virtually given up all sweets, regular soft drinks, and skip on desserts. I do occasionally still drink diet soda or La Croix. I do have vegetables and fruit in my diet. I don't think my problem is the kind of foods I eat. It's how much I eat. I don't just eat some cantaloupe slices when I'm craving sweets, I'll eat the whole cantaloupe. I don't eat a serving of vegetable/chicken stirfry, I'll eat the whole wok. And if I treat myself to pizza, I can't just have 1 slice, I'll have the whole thing. I just have this hunger that doesn't stop, even when I'm physically full. I'm seemingly incapable of leaving leftovers or preparing meals ahead of time. I eat till there's nothing left to eat. And sometimes I'll go out of my way to buy more food if I'm still hungry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy whole life I've been this way. My mother said that as a baby I went through formula like crazy (I was a c-section birth and I couldn't breastfeed) and I slowly gained weight since toddlerhood. I went through some old medical records and I was 20 lbs overweight at the age of 3. I was never a skinny kid. Every year I seemed to gain 20 lbs until I hit 500 in my early 20s. I am 30 now. I'm already feeling the damage from my eating habits. I already went through what felt like 3 or 4 wake up calls. Sometimes I fix things around. 2 years ago, I lost feeling in my feet. I got scared and changed my diet for 3 months. I lowered my A1C and lost 20 lbs. The feeling in my feet returned. My doctors said that the nerve damage might have been minimal so if I keep eating healthier, I could get all nerve function back. But then I went through some relationship crap. And I started eating the same way again and got back to where I was. The numbness returned. And at that point I just learned to live with numb feet. Last December, I had a life threatening infection that was complicated from high blood sugar from diabetes. I was hospitalized for 3 days and was in pain. I changed things only slightly. There were weeks where I did good and other weeks where I didn't do so well. It's a constant and daily struggle. And here I am, 6 months later, full and feeling like crap after an eating binge. And I still want to eat more.", "subreddit": "FoodAddiction"}

{"post_id": "caf37w", "created_utc": 1562551438, "title": "random non-food-related things that helped me recover", "author": "PizzaIsASuperfood", "self_text": "- Having a house plant was really helpful. The process of reading and learning about how plants too need nutrition and certain sunlight, soil requirements... somehow got me feeling more compassionate towards myself and my basic nutrient needs. \n\n- Also, did you know that trees store energy? They do! Even if it's not visible in the form of leaves and stuff, they store energy to get through the winter. Trees (and other plants) also won't germinate or grow if they don't sense that the environment is right-- not enough water, warmth, sun -- even if they have the energy storage. The plant needs to be reassured that the environment has the necessary ingredients, and consistently so. This kind of helped me think about all the internal repairs that my body had to do -- even if I had already gotten my period back and felt fine, I had little bouts of increased hunger at night and it was helpful for me to think about it as my body still trying to build up its internal energy reserves, and that my body was also trying to \"see\" if it could get whatever food it wanted, any time it wanted.\n\n- I've written this before, but getting rid of my step counter on my phone (which had been installed automatically on newer iPhones... but [there is a way to disable it](https://www.idownloadblog.com/2016/05/18/how-to-stop-iphone-tracking-steps-fitness-activity/)) was super helpful and now I never even think about the number of steps I am taking per day. I used to walk everywhere and check my steps every .... 2000 steps or so. It was annoying. I was never present; I never enjoyed or really took my surroundings in when chained to the step counter. The only time I use a step counter is sometimes when I'm on vacation or a hike and get curious about how far I'll walk in a day. \n\n- Reading and watching videos about what elderly people regret: such as this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AThycGCakk\n\n- Other sobering statistics, like [the average woman spends 17 years of her life on a diet](https://www.medicaldaily.com/average-woman-spends-17-years-her-life-diets-242601), coupled with [this chart of your life in weeks](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html). \n\n- The thought that, ... if I was worrying that it was \"too late\" for me to recover, the fact is, I am always going to be younger than somebody else. I am always young enough to be somebody's \"younger sister,\" seen as somebody who still has all the time in the world to rebound and change and grow. \n\n- I kept a document/email thread of little quotes/snippets of scientific information/etc about the recovery process. Things like data on the time it took for hormones to get back into sync after an eating disorder, anecdotes from people who had been through the process... it helped me get through some times that I had doubts about the process. I referred to it whenever I felt I wanted that extra support. \n\n- Not exactly related, but investing in your sleep is always a good idea and can be helpful in the recovery process: black-out curtains, a good eye mask, figuring out a good sleep/nighttime routine, keeping your sleeping space clean and clutter-free, a dim light bulb to read rather than reading on screens, audiobooks or relaxing music instead of reading on screens, etc.\n\n- I have some amazing friends who have some of the mentally healthiest eating habits. (This sounds creepy, but I don't mean it in a creepy way lol). Observing them for a little while and initially trying to channel their zest in eating a good, generous meal was helpful. I remember hanging out with one of my friends late at night when I was still early on in recovery, and she offered me some dinner, and I declined, because it was later than my normal meal time. She said, \"yeah, it is late, and I'm not super hungry, but I try to make myself eat regular meals.\" That really stuck with me, and throughout my recovery I have reflected on the body's desire for predictability, regular daily rhythms, and how, especially in recovery, predictability can take not only the form of eating at a certain time, as popularized by the intermittent fasting folks, but actually in eating something at all to show your body that there are predictable sources of energy in the environment. \n\n- I kept a vlog (really just a series of videos on my phone - I don't post them anywhere) of my thoughts, reflections, progress. I would make a video about once a month. It was like doing therapy for myself. I used it as a time to be honest about things I was still struggling with and what I hoped to achieve in the coming weeks, like hanging out with a friend, or feeling more comfortable with looking at myself in a mirror, etc.\n\n- Some reflections I did make: [\"Once I'm finally attractive, I'll be a happier, calmer person\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckeatingdisorders/comments/c15gjr/once_im_finally_attractive_ill_be_a_happier/)\n\n- When I first started recovery, I felt like I needed to write down a list of all the things that I did that were really dragging me down. I had a sense of what sorts of things I did when things were most severe, and things I was able to do when my behaviors were less severe... I ranked them all and it kind of helped me get a sense of how to at least start moving things towards the \"less severe\" end of behaviors. Now I have a list of shit I used to do when I was disordered (like buy all these teas from grocery stores, eat an abnormal amount of carrots and hummus, cut cakes into ridiculously thin slices) and it's more just something that I laugh at and use to remind myself of how far I've come. \n\n- I made a pie chart of things I spent thinking about and also charted that through recovery. Before, I would spend easily 80 or 90% of my day thinking about food, grocery shopping, saving money. Later on I estimated I spent about 20% of my day about when my overshoot would dissipate. Since then, things have evolved to thinking more about the latest book I am reading, or when I am going to hang out with friends, or how to get more sleep. Kind of nice to have it out there on a pie chart-- a concrete indicator of how much life the disordered eating is sucking away.\n\n- Early in recovery, tupperware was helpful because it allowed me to eat a full meal. Especially when I struggled with inhaling all these snack-y foods in my kitchen right when I got home instead of practicing how to sit down and eat a full meal... having tupperware and ready-made meals in my fridge was a good bridge. Now, 1+ year into recovery, I don't have such extreme hunger so I can wait without any issue or urges to snack, and I can cook myself a meal if I need to, so there's less of a need to depend on the tupperware. But I remember the tupperware being an important bridge towards getting to where I am now.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I am 27. I started my transition when I was 25 and weighed like 350 pounds. Growing up I struggled with my weight a lot, and though I went up and down, I never really successfully lost weight and due to some bingey periods I was steadily going up in weight. Before my transition, I was deeply depressed, my social life revolved around drinking, and when it was bad I would eat so much. I would eat a huge takeout meal for lunch, then a whole frozen pizza in the evening, and often more than that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut when I started HRT, I felt like I was invested in my body and my appearance for the first time, and felt like I really had a shot at a life where I could happy with the way I was perceived, and so I started to successfully lose weight for the first time. I lost 100 pounds in the first 9-ish months of my transition. I am finally at a place where I can accept that the way that I did this was not healthy for me physically or emotionally, even though it hurts me to say that because the time that I was losing so much weight so quickly (and, because of the HRT, finally starting to feel okay about my body) was also the happiest I've ever been and the most satisfied with life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring that time, I was basically doing an extremely low-carb thing. I would not eat before 6 p.m., no matter what. At 6 (usually when I would get home from work or class) I would eat a very small meal and a spoonful of peanut butter. Then, a few hours later, I would have another spoonful and a serving of almonds. I did that for almost a year. I would drink unhealthy amounts of coffee to sustain myself during the day. I would get really bad headaches towards the early evening but I would just try to shrug them off. I didn't drink often but on the few times I did, I would get very drunk very easily.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remember one night last july, I had a long day at work and then a professional drinks thing after. I didn't eat anything all day but had a bunch of wine at drinks. I finally got off the subway around 7:30 having eaten nothing that day and quite drunk. I was exhausted. I remember just looking at the direction of my apartment and then looking at the direction of this park nearby, and for some reason I just went to the park and cried for like 45 minutes instead of going home to eat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started to develop a kind of guilt around breaking my own rules. Like a day just felt cheap or spoiled if I ate early or if I ate more than I was supposed to. This was so powerful! Like, even just the thought of it was enough to keep me in line. Again, in retrospect, this was so unhealthy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe whole year I was terrified that the whole thing might collapse and I would go back to my bingey ways. Well, eventually that did happen and that's where I am now. After about a year of successful weight loss, this past January I started to slip up and started binging here and there. For awhile my weight basically stayed steady but then it started to go up a little bit. By now, 7 months later, I have gained back a little bit of the weight that I had lost but not very much. So I still have a lot of weight to lose, but my progress from that year isn't gone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now, I feel stuck in this period where I will be eating like I was, severely restricting, and then a week or so will go by and I'll slip up and binge. That's what's been going on for a little while now. And I'm just so bummed about it because it felt like I had such a good thing going and now it's derailed. But maybe I shouldn't want to go back to that because it was a deeply unhealthy place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm just so tired of not having access to a healthy, reliable, long-term relationship with food. Its like I have two modes and they're just fighting each other constantly. If I manage to get back on that train of weight loss, what does the endgame even look like? If I ever get to a place where I'm happy with my weight, do I get a chance to start over and have a normal relationship with food?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also acknowledge that the other half of this is, how do I stop caring about how other people are perceiving me and my body in the world? What part of my obsessiveness over all of this is just gender stuff and what part is just weight stuff? is there a meaningful difference? do I just need to learn to stop caring?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthis was so long. i am so sorry. if you read any of it, I am grateful.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

This winter/spring everything spiraled downwards and my binges were totally out of control, I binged almost everyday from February till May, when I dieted, I religiously restricted calories cutting out bread from my diet totally, I used to count calories on MFP but then stopped on February, I thought I'd give myself a break and then come back to the dieting/counting game strong, I didn't. Everyday it got worse, when everybody in the house was asleep I would go to the store and buy 5k+ kcal worth of sweets and pastries the stuff I always cut whenever I dieted, I've lost weight multiple times before this way but regained it all back + more, from Feb to May my weight has gone up from 74 kg to 91 kg, 5'4\" 23 yo female, I knew cutting foods I loved like that would never work and the restrict/binge cycle would never end, so starting May, I started CICO, I was busy with exams so I didn't have enough time anyways to overeat, my only remaining bit of discipline only appears on exams time!, I ate whatever I wanted, usually healthy but would go for an icecream out with friends every now and then, something I hadn't done during the past two years, overall calories averaged at 1300, by the end of May I was down to 84 kg, I decided to take a break during June where I'd maintain on an 1800 kcal, everything went great as planned, but then exactly a week ago, I binged again.

I finally broke my fear, I have been going running everyday ever since that binge, I no longer cut any food from my diet, I treat my sweet tooth everyday and I'm finally enjoying eating sandwiches again!

Before this I was like rail thin. I got fat through my mother's cooking (extremely heavy use of oil because my step father liked it - I thought the food was gross and so was he). Once I moved back to my father's I changed my diet and started exercising and the pounds flew off. But I was still fat. Years went by and the pounds were slowly coming off. I was eating healthy, but my calories were too high. I remember I became friends with someone who had a very similar frame as me, but he was extremely lean and I was absolutely in love with his physique, and jealous too. Girls found him really attractive (used me to get close to him), and it shattered my self esteem. Everything I could do, he could do better. I felt inadequate.\n\nSo I upped my game. I started studying harder in school, exercising harder, and being more mindful. I sprinted every single day (I got an Achilles' tendon injury after going every single day for 6 months straight). Here's the thing though. Whenever I am truly passionate about something, I get fixated with failure of all things. But oh no binging hasn't began yet. I still didn't know how to properly lose weight. \n\nIt wasn't until I got sick with food poisoning from eating salmon (and mindlessly working on a kinesiology project) that I learned the golden rule: less calories = weight loss. I felt like I discovered the holy grail. Then I graduated. Here comes a summer of fads. But here's the thing, I didn't buy a food scale. I WAS EATING AT MAINTENANCE THE ENTIRE TIME - keto, intermittent fasting! So I started counting calories on keto and pounds came off. I hated my university, I hated being alone, and I hated my body - but I felt like I still wouldn't be successful. \n\nSo in comes binging. Every Friday going from university to my hometown - it seemed inevitable. I would either be tempted by something on the way back, or it would be once I hit my calories and dehydration settled in. I would be knees deep into muffins, cookies, or any other junk at my father's house. This cycle repeated on and on until the holidays came. \n\nFinally when they did, I binged for three days in a row. The final day I was at my mother's house. I remember the feeling - I felt like the same fat kid, helplessly becoming unhealthy. Flashbacks were playing in my head, and I felt oh so sick.\n\nBut there was something new that awoke in me. There was a feeling of calmness, and confidence - something I hadn't felt in months. All I had felt was despair, and self-loathing. I was determined to count every single calorie and make my way down the scale. I remember at my sister's New Year's Eve party, I just didn't feel like eating myself sick like everyone else did. So I helped myself to one or two cookies, I think I passed on the cheesecake, too.\n\nNow, back to university. I wanted to drop out. But I couldn't. What ended up dropping was the number on the scale. I lowered my calories from 2000 to 1800. I also instead of not sprinting every Friday, it was every other Friday. Also, that day I used intermittent fasting and would indulge lightly on whatever I craved during the week. The pounds came off so quickly. I was so preoccupied with school. Before I knew it, I was at 139lbs (approx. I didn't weigh myself). I cried. I maintained, but when summer came, I went up a little bit because of how bored I was.\n\nI experienced my first out of control binge session in late July. I felt weak and light headed and just went for food. I couldn't stop. I ballooned to the 160s. It was all in my abdomen too. The second I could move to my new place at the new school, I did it. When I did, the binging all stopped, and I was happy again - preoccupied with school once more, just like before. I was back in the 140s. Then I read about PSMF. So I thought, \"Why not try it?\" I did. I went for two weeks and lost 5lbs. My biggest regret was not stopping here. \n\nBut I didn't. I kept trying. But the second Friday hit, I was wasting $60 on food. My weight was stable up until November. Then, my father would come up every Tuesday and Saturday and I ate everything in sight - frustrated with how I couldn't stick with it.\n\nRinse repeat to June, where I tried using ephedrine. Killed my binging habit. But yo yo dieting was the new thing. After another session, I maintained for another 6 months. Chopped up my card, binged once every week. Still looked good though. Even though I was at my smallest, I felt huge on the inside - I needed to be hidden. In my extra smalls and a 28 inch waist, I needed to suck in my cheeks and I couldn't be seen in photos. ...If it weren't for the binging, I would've been a skeleton. 600 calories of tuna is not enough for a 5'10 man at 137lbs. Regardless of how much I convinced myself of this. I always compared myself to a decaying plant. My hands were extremely cold, my feet even colder. My nails had a slightly blue tint to them. As much as I wanted to be covered, I couldn't wear a jacket because my metabolic rate would go lower. I saw myself as nothing more than a grade on paper, and as handsome or hideous. \n\nThis moment I remember vividly. There was a hole in the plan I created. Just because I didn't physically have a card on me, didn't mean I couldn't spend money. My father let me use his card to buy Subway online. I ran there, got a dozen cookies, and two footlongs. It wasn't enough. I repeated this a couple of hours later. The  I finished the day with 4 Starbucks drinks. When I took care of this, then Apple pay was the problem. I must've spent a thousand dollars in less than a week and I couldn't stop it. Now I was in the 150s. I called my sister hysterically crying. The day after, binge. It wouldn't stop until I didn't recognize myself. I changed my diet back to what it was before because I somehow recovered from restriction instantly. Still... it wasn't enough because I was still a failure deep down. Binging every single week until my very first psychotic episode.\n\nI went out in a -32 degree Celsius, delusional and essentially drugged by all the food. I wanted to go back to my father's and was too out of it to realize I could use an Uber. Luckily for me I didn't go with the original plan, which was to walk over 100kms. My hands were frost bitten, my feet were bloodied, and my internal temperature was alarmingly low. I thought I was hallucinating on the subway, and I told someone. They contacted authorities, and I was eventually placed into a psychiatric hospital.\n\nI recapped the events to a psychiatrist who made remarks like, \"You're so thin. How do you take in that much?!\" \"Why would your father buy you 5 burgers at once and not question you?\"\nI was diagnosed with binge eating disorder on the spot. \n\nNow for treatment. That place was a joke. The second psychiatrist didn't even ask about my binging behaviours. He told me it was normal for people at my age. So I left, and my sister found me hysterically crying again on the streets. So she took me back and they then offered crisis care.\n\nNew psychiatrist, refused any medication until I mentioned I was using ephedrine again (she gave me prozac). My therapist essentially checked in with me to make sure I wasn't killing myself. Then I was placed with my school's counselling. Screw this woman. She dismissed my binging as \"my body not being at it's set point\" and ignoring all mental aspects. Meanwhile the setpoint is mostly dictated by eating habits, and fat cells not being filled - but I was already past the point that my body was used to being at a low weight. She ended up leaving the school (I forget why). Rather than transferring me over to another counsellor, I don't have a therapist any more. I just visit the school's medical centre hoping I can get vyvanse or wellbutrin to help me with impulsive aspects (but I'm on lexapro - hate it. Makes me binge and see it as having no consequence). \n\nLuckily for me now I understand what is healthy and what isn't. But I kind of miss being at 15% body fat. I looked good, and aside from being extremely cold (the second time around), I felt good too. I know I can get there in a healthy way. I do however use fridge locks, transaction limits, a fitness coach with emphasis on mind work. I cycle ephedrine, and I'm quitting lexapro today.\n\nWish me the best. I start my new job next week.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I never thought I'd be posting on this subreddit, but oh well. It would've fitted on r/DecidingToBeBetter, but I felt like it was better to post here as it is more relevant. :) It'll be a long post, so get a diet coke!\n\nI won't get into a long ramble of my boohoo ed story-  In TLDR; I've experienced disordered eating nearly my entire life, and I've been suffering from severe bulimia for around three years. I've been on every spectrum of the ED, from AN-R to Orthorexia.\n\nWell, it was a moment of epiphany I guess. I get these alot, but I wanted to document this one. It was something that I really wanted to articulate in words. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy eating disorder promised me happiness, success and fulfilment. An solid identity of a successful, gorgeous female with a charming, attractive physical appearance.\n\nLong story short, it brought me none. It brought me further into a spiral of depression, anxiety attacks, social anxiety and self harm behaviours. \n\nFor three years of my life, I had hunched over on the toilet on a daily basis, scraping the back of my throat for the shame I\u2019ve consumed. The constant avoidance of mirrors due to self-loathing. The constant harming, cutting and self-induced pain I\u2019ve inflicted on myself because I\u2019ve hated myself for so long. The blisters on the bottom of my feet, the vomit on my fitbit. The sweet lie of \"one last time\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn all honesty, I never, ever knew something like this would ever happen to me. I never knew I would be so deep into a self destructive behaviour- I was always obsessed with self improvement and finding an identity. I'm guessing that my eating disorder gave me a fake sense of self improvement, and an identity- of a Bulimic/Anorexic/Binger/WhatevertheFUCKI'mdoing. I was numb all the time. I was so so tired and devoid of life. I was constantly looking at food pictures and nothing I did was remotely productive. I soon lost all my hobbies and the only thing that consumed my time was food shopping.\n\nThe fucking stereotypical thing is, I wanted recovery. I tried every day to recover- trying to eat, trying to repress binge urges, relearn my hunger; I always caved to the ED behaviours and beat myself up more and more, my self-esteem plummeting to the abyss. I was so desperate for change, but since I wasn't able to even stop a binge/purge session, I spiraled down more and more into self-hatred and sabotage. (Being at a high weight most of the time was also pretty invalidating and I felt like an utter failure)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nB/Ping is so tiring. You guys know it well- the process, the mindset and the utter feeling of shame and disgust towards yourself. It's extremely exhausting and numbing. Yet we do it either habitually or compulsively. I was so so tired of it, I just wanted it to end. Yet I continued.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd one day, my stomach nearly ruptured. It was after an normal binge. Everything was the same. However, that day specifically- I could not physically purge. my body forbade me to. I spent fucking seven hours trying to gag myself, crying, punching, and drinking anything to try so hard to just. purge purge purge. Then, in the end; I drunk bleach. I vomitted all over the floor, and the only fucking thought that comes to my mind that second? Lets go weigh myself so I can see if I lost weight. Its finally fucking out! Yay I won't gain tomorrow.\n\nWhat the literal fuck. I cleaned up my shit and bit the bullet, and stepped into the shower. In a hazy daze, nearly fainting, I came back to my senses. What the fuck was I doing? What the actual fuck? You almost killed yourself and you only care about weight. \n\nIt was extremely compuslive, and my stomach was at the brink of rupturing. If I wasn't as young, and healthy as I was, it would've fucking ruptured. And I knew deep inside, if it happened again, I would die. I would actually die.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHoly fuck. I started panicking. I've been suicidal and gave attempts, but they were half-hearted. I still had a will to live. I just wanted to change, not live this life. I didn't want to die. But this disorder has taken so much control over me to the point that I would kill myself rather than weigh a few kgs higher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had my moment of epiphany right there. Honestly, this wasn't the first time that I had realisation of 'holy shit i need to stop', but this time was definitely different. I was repulsed by my behaviours. Usually, the cleaning of vomit doesn't phase me. But it repulsed me, once I thought about it. the odor of vomit started making me nauseous. I realise I needed change. I wanted myself back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurrently, I am in therapy and talking to a psychiatrist. She is amazing. I have refrained from alot of b/ping, and binge urges are nearly nonexistent now. However, I am now leaning towards AN-R, which is quite bad as its going from a behaivor and jumping to another. I am trying my best to relearn my hunger cues, eat 3 meals and 3 snacks (aka plentiful) and god, I feel so so much better than when I was bulimic. I regret every moment of the three years I've had with the disorder, and god. It was so so painful. Looking back, I was so miserable. It was the worst years in my entire life. I'm glad to say I will never go back to those behaviours. Even if sometimes I slip up, or sob and breakdown of wanting to b/p- I will never go back. Because I am happy and content without bping- its a detrimental spiral that led me to nothing but numbness and fatigue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I am struggling with restriction and eating so little now. I have no idea how my stomach has shrunken so fast; but now whenever I eat something, I feel so painfully full (but mentally hungry). I'm also showing orthorexic tendencies. It's another fight with another ED, I guess. Bulimic to AN-R, huh thats a weird change. I'm severely underweight now since I've been trapped in the allure of restriction, but I know I need to fight this too. I know I'll be able to recover, and beat the shit out of the ED that has ruined my life. I have ambitions. I have big, big dreams of helping people and improving their lives. I have dreams of studying. I want my education and I want to get knowledge. I want to live, and breathe without thinking *about how many calories was that?* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am going to be better, stronger. I'm only 17- I have so much I want to do and I want to achieve. I am tired of the constant brain fog I am in. I want to eat. I am hungry. I am ravenous to live life.\n\nEvery day with a win against my ED thoughts  is a victory. Going back to behaviours only reinforce the thoughts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSmall Steps.\n\nThank you for reading this, kind stranger. I could write something self deprecating here, but I'm really trying not to beat myself up anymore. I really wish we could all get through this. I hope every day is a better day for you. :)", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Or so I thought. \n\nRecently I\u2019ve started to put on a bit more weight (I\u2019m finally at the lower cusp of healthy weight for my height and age) and I\u2019ve started to get some really crippling dysphoria about my body.

The fasting eventually stopped and the binging became way more frequent (daily or more frequently) which caused me to gain 25 pounds back in 2 months. I also developed the habits of laxative abuse and overexercising. After my therapist finding out the extent of everything and strongly suggesting outpatient treatment, (which I should probably do but can't fit in when I'm working 12 hour days) I've been trying to do things differently and not make changes that are based on deprivation or motivated by shame and self loathing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know it sounds sooooo counterintuitive but I've noticed over the past couple weeks that by keeping everything I usually crave stocked in my apartment, the binge urges I usually get just haven't been happening. This was sort of inspired by that book The Fuck It Diet. Knowing everything is available to me if I want it removes that binge high I get when I go out and buy things to eat. The foods I enjoy are no longer on this pedestal I've been putting them on. It's really weird and I feel like there's still something wrong with having 12 different kinds of snacks in my cupboard but if it keeps me from binging I guess I'm fine with it.

It all started as most eating disorders do in middle school. Sixth grade to be exact.

It bothered me for a majority of the year until spring started and I decided I would start biking. I would bike for 1-2 hours a day and think of her words.

That summer I moved to a new town about 30 minutes away and my ed went away until December of that year when I stopped eating lunch and people commented even told the nurse but I persisted but didn\u2019t lose. That June I downloaded LoseIt! And became a regular on MPA. Then for the first time that August I lost 10 pounds. Over my 8th grade year I got myself down to 107 pounds (my highest was 138) then maintained around 110-114 on a binge restrict where I have been since.

My weight would always fluctuate between healthy and obese. Sometimes I would be good for a few months, and I would believe that I was 'cured'. But it would always come back. I never told anyone, never sought any help, I assumed I could beat it on my own, and nobody had to know. It's why i never had an official diagnosis.\n\nI'm now 29, and recently got into a relationship with an amazing man. I realised that my problems with eating were interfering, making me insecure, making me hide parts of myself. I am constantly thinking about food, about losing weight (at a healthy weight currently, but still a bmi of 23), it's messing me up.\nI realised that at the very least, I am bulimic.\n\nI told my boyfriend about it, it was embarrasing and painful, but I wanted to tell him because he needs to know what he is up against. Slowly I've been telling him about how I feel, my thoughts and when I purge. It is probably one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.\n\nRecently I had a setback, I binged and purged, and burst a bunch of bloodvessels and my throat bled too. I realised how bad I am, and that if I want to continue my relationship with my boyfriend, I need to live, I need to be healthy and I need to change my relationship with myself, and with food.\n\nI do want to get professional help, but I can't afford it right now, not at all. My boyfriend has been amazing, he's my rock. He supports me everyday, listens to me, and never judges. But he is not equipped to help me fix myself. I want to know if any of you have been in a similar situation. If you have any advice for him, and how to deal with me. Or for me, how I can help myself. Because I don't want this anymore. I don't want food and weight to control everything I do. I want to love and live and be happy and confident in who I am.\n\nSo, do any of you have supportive spouses? What do they do that helps you? Any advice on changing your mindset, breaking through the habits? Can you ever really truly recover, or will it always be a struggle?", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I'll go on a run or exercise to burn off extra calories. Even if I only eat 600 calories that day. Some weeks I'll eat 500 calories in food and drink the other 500 in beer. Other times I'll binge on food so I'm \"making up\" for the days I lost. Only recently have I started to make myself puke when I eat now. I don't try to eat sugar or carbs either. I feel horrible all the time mentally.  A part of me wants to go back to that time I was living with my Dad cause I thought I was prettier and healthier. It's so weird. Some days I feel fine and eat a normal amount and the next day I'll punish myself for eating like a normal person...\nThanks for any input.

In that I've reached a point where my goals have changed for the first time, I'm not desperate to reach a really low weight and hit the underweight category. I want to reach a reasonable healthy weight, maintain, lower my body fat percentage and be fit and strong. I've gone from obese to a normal weight already and in the past two months just...let go of wanting to be Super Skinny, I just want strength and fitness. I know the chances of me looking in the mirror and being satisfied is basically nil so my focus has shifted on other things - progress in the activity I've taken up, progress in the gym with strength training.\n\nBut I'm still engaging in disordered behaviours. I still rely on the numbers of the scale to tell me I'm okay. I'm still restricting calories, higher than some here but lower than deemed acceptable, I still get a kick out of seeing emerging collarbones and hints of ribcage, I still have a really warped idea of what I'd need to eat to maintain, I still abuse laxatives,  and I'm still purging. It's just now I'm also doing regular exercise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recognise it's dumb and these behaviours are going to get in the way of my goal but I'm also still stupidly unwilling to change. Mentally I'm probably the closest I've ever been to potentially recovering because I'm not so set of this idea of being incredibly thin and I'm not as wrapped up in the aesthetic side of things but at the same time I'm as unwilling as ever to let go of the scraps of disordered behaviour I have. In brief moments of clarity I'm even a bit concerned I may be deluding myself that my eating habits are perfectly fine and healthy and I'm totally right that eating barely half of my BMR is the only way to lose weight and if I want to maintain all I have to do is match my BMR - totally ignoring the activity I do. \n\nIdk. I think I'm just ranting a bit. I've had this messed up relationship with food and my body for too long. It's too ingrained.

Just to clarify, I don't have any beef with her personally . She's probably a great person. I just have a problem with how she labels her channel and makes some videos. \n\nFirst off, her top 2 videos are her anorexia story and what she ate every day as an anorexic. In the anorexia story video, she goes into extreme detail when she probably should not. Her \"what I ate in a day during anorexia\" video is obviously a terrible idea for a recovery channel. \n\nShe has made numerous detailed videos telling what she ate every day and what time, how much she exercised, how she hid her ED from her family, fainting, and much more . All of these videos are basically just her straight out telling what she did, so they're basically indirect 'tip' videos. She also made a video that's literally just a slideshow of her body checks from when she was underweight and another showing videos of when she was underweight. \n\nShe rarely makes any actually helpful recovery videos, and when she does, they never get any views. The most triggering videos are her most popular which shows that her viewerbase is mostly made up of people with EDs who are looking to get triggered, not to recover. \n\nFinally, she just recently returned after a long break of not posting videos and confessed that she relapsed. Even though she seemingly just recovered again, she's already making videos on relapse as if she's an expert on it. \n\nI don't think that Anastasia is secretly trying to be a pro ana channel or anything. You can tell she has good intentions, but she wants to tell the world about every little thing that she did during anorexia. It could be a *look how disordered I was* kind of thing- I don't know. I think that she should either stop making videos or stop making triggering ones", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I'm also aware that people can be fit and have cellulite! It's just sooo new for me). For the first time in about 4 years, things don't fit me anymore and I have a different reaction every damn time I try someone on that's too small. About two months ago, a top I wore at the same time a year ago no longer fit me. I was stoked because my muscles and boobs were back! About two weeks ago, a pair of pants didn't fit me. I laughed it off and threw them away. I was honest-to-god proud that I actually have a butt and hips now. Today, I put on a pair of shorts (my favorite pair) to go to the store and this new butt that I have, that most days I'm super excited about, said NOPE. It made me feel awful and like I've failed despite KNOWING that I'm consciously doing things in the gym to grow my glutes and legs back to their pre-anorexia size and strength (I'm an avid weightlifter and cyclist); despite KNOWING that I'm healthier; that I have a sex drive again; that I have energy again; that I look and feel womanly and feminine again; despite knowing that even at my THINNEST one of the areas in question was still a \"problem\" area (albeit not as \"problematic\") simply because that's where my body stores fat and *more* fat in that area means that I am healthy and thriving and that's a good thing. I just can't shake feeling disappointed in myself and like I've \"let myself go.\" \n\nI don't think I'd be having such a hard time with this if I wasn't going to Italy on Friday for ten days. A year+ ago, I would have severely restricted leading up to a trip. I would have worked out 2-3x a day. I haven't done that this time around. I keep saying I'm going to try to at least eat a tiny bit less, but then I get hungry and I eat (mind-blowing, I know), but... when those damn shorts didn't fit, I immediately felt like a weak, undisciplined subpar human being for not being \"stronger\" and for not having the \"willpower\" to lose a certain amount of weight/restrict my intake prior to Italy. Now, I feel like I can't enjoy myself on my trip because I'll just come home \"even bigger.\" \n\nI plan on trying to enjoy myself and I know that this is just Ana talking, but some days just suck and I'm scared of how I'll react when I get home knowing that I will likely gain a little when I'm there. On one hand, this trip is a HUGE accomplishment for me because I accepted the invitation -- I said yes. When I was asked to go on a similar trip with my father last year, I declined because I wouldn't be able to track my intake. My life back then was a series of \"No's\" scattered between bland meals and forced workouts. On the other hand, while it sounds silly, I'm genuinely scared. I'm very anxious and confused and I don't understand how people can just go somewhere and not think about what a particular food will or will not do to their bodies. I thought I kicked this and this trip has shown me that I still have a lot of work to do.\n\nIf anyone has any mantras or words of wisdom or coping strategies that they have in place when they go on vacation (or when they get back from vacation...I'm really worried about that whole ordeal), I'm all ears.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

My whole life I have been slightly chubby, but I always loved food and just didn't care unless I was around girls who got more attention/were thinner. In high school, I got my first serious boyfriend, and I started gaining more weight- he had a brother who was really hurtful and started calling me fat multiple times. Along with this, my mother got diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and subsequent to that, I pretty much started over exercising and under eating. I lost a lot of weight very fast, and became very skinny- but once people started making comments about it, such as \"it looks like you're about to vanish\" juxtaposed with feeling proud and \"beautiful\", I didn't know what to think. I finally checked the scale and saw that I was below what I idealistically wanted to be, so I gained and maintained a good body weight for a few years after. My mental state is horrible now, I had developed agoraphobia around  2 years ago due to feeling \"ugly\" and, as a result, gained weight from binge chewing/spitting. When I started to realize how I felt about my body, I started not eating as much and gradually working out excessively again. I also binge and purge now, and at first, I was good at \"fasting\" for days while working out- and I got really skinny again- people started to make fun of my weight and make comments about me being in a concentration camp, etc. I kind of liked it. I liked looking skinny. I've been binge eating for days now and I hate it. I really just want to be very thin and maintain it, even if it means working out every day and eating extremely healthy. But, I'm scared ot food- and than I give into the urges of over eating... I usually chew and spit out probably 10k cals and then vomit it up, then I proceed to work out. It is making me super exhausted and depressed. I just wish I knew why I was sabotaging myself. I know that, at this point, I can have the body I want but what if the body I want is so skinny that it personally alienates me from people, and that gives me a sense of power over my physical vessel? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope everyone reading this and going through this gets better. It's a pain in the ass, but at the end of the day, being healthy is literally the obvious choice", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}
{"post_id": "cbd4of", "created_utc": 1562740258, "title": "My binge- and compulsive-eating have resurfaced worse than ever, and because of my previous success in losing weight, no one believes me and I have nowhere else to turn for help.", "author": "Telvanna", "self_text": "This is a tad long, so please bear with me.\n\nContext: In the past, I weighted around 210lbs, largely gained through my binge-eating and compulsive over-eating.  Even beyond the big binges, I was prone to stress-eating and eating out of boredom (and just emotional eating in general).  Over the past two years I got ahold of it and managed to lose 90lbs, a necessity due to health problems and the fact that my joints were breaking down (I have a small frame that could not physically support the weight) and I had a pretty good schedule going on while working through my graduate degree.  However, once I finished that degree I moved back home and started applying to the next step (law school--my applications were successful), and from there everything just started to.  Spiral.\n\nLately, it's just been out of control.  In the past during a binge my typical intake would often include an entire lasagna tray with an extra bag of cheese on top, plus a bag of chips, chocolate (like mini eggs), etc, but now it's literally whatever I can get my hands on as fast as possible.  I feel completely out of control and what's worse is these binges are making me physically ill--and I *still* won't stop eating!  I'll feel like shit and then get up and go secretly eat *more food*, literally whatever I can see.  I'm terrified of regaining the weight I lost (for various health reasons--including a heart condition I was born with--it would be disastrous if I put the weight back on, so it's not just for The Aesthetics, though I'll admit those are nice), and I've tried bringing it up with friends and family, but I get the same dismissive responses from everyone, because they think that because I'm now small that if anything I \"must be anorexic--we don't want you getting *too* skinny, dear, so be careful.\"  Once I even got snapped at to \"shut up and stop thinking about it.\"  Every time I try to bring it up I get told something similar.  \"Oh you're skinny enough\" \"oh I wouldn't worry about it\" \"you're small, you can't think like that\" \"it's fine, you're skinny\" \"this is unhealthy, I don't want you becoming anorexic\" etc.  Note that they *never* say anything like this to my youngest sister, who is my same height (I'm 5'6\") and ten pounds lighter than I am (I'm sitting at 124lbs after gaining 4lbs this week due to bingeing).  No one tells her she's too skinny, or dismiss her concerns, even though she eats way less than me too.  It's just me, because my family and friends are so used to my being obese and my old eating habits that they can't reconcile the two.  I'm so frustrated because I'm trying to reach out and get help for my emotional and binge-eating but every time I try I'm either dismissed or people get legitimately angry at me, and it's clear they don't believe that overeating it my problem.\n\nI know part of their reluctance to believe me stems from the fact that they're still not used to me being this small, but I'm getting desperate.  Even my family doctor isn't listening to me when I tell her that *undereating isn't my problem,* because she's used to me being obese*.*  It's constantly fighting the urge not to binge 2000+ calories in one sitting that's the problem!  It's the secret eating and the frantic blackout binges.  I've tried using apps, I've tried writing things down, I've tried slowing down my eating, etc.  Food is constantly on my mind.  I crave anything and everything, and will eat anything and everything, even foods I don't like.  Every time I eat a meal, I scarf it down like I'm trying to win a race, and I continue eating even after I'm already full.  My obesity majorly messed with my hunger cues so I have a hard time telling when I'm truly hungry/full, but even when I know I am I'll continue to eat.  I desperately want my relationship with food to be healthy again, but it seems to be getting worse, not better, and obviously as the stress mounts so too does the urge to binge or, failing that, still frantically and emotionally snack, and I've been giving into it more often than not.  The past week especially has been really bad, and I've spent every night feeling ill and bloated as a result (and just to clarify: no, I'm not bulimic; I physically can't make myself throw up).  Not only that but the guilt and shame is eating me alive and it's really taking a toll on my mental health, which I've been trying really hard to fix.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice?  Anything that worked for them?  I feel like I'm screaming into the void for help and no one is taking me seriously, or even listening to me.  I don't want this to be my life, but at this point I literally have nowhere else to turn.  I just want to stop thinking about food 24/7.  I want to regain control of my life.  I can't start law school this fall already out of control like this.  I know how it will end if I do.  Help?", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I was applying to law schools, grad schools, taking the LSAT and GRE, and doing a thesis. I ended up losing some weight without trying and realized that if I ate less my symptoms would be less severe. I've been on really shaky ground since then, with periods of near-relapse every few months. I've had multiple tests and seen multiple GI doctors and recently got a diagnosis of IBS. I also had to defer a year for law school, which I now think was a mistake, since being in school is what has kept me from relapsing completely in the past. I'm now in my pre-recovery weight range (still technically normal/slightly above normal, but far below my set point and what is normal for my body). now that I've graduated and am not in school I have zero motivation to even try and rein in the restriction, especially since restricting keeps my GI symptoms in check. but I also think I'm just using the IBS as an excuse and could probably manage without restricting. \n\njust wondering if people have had similar experiences with chronic illnesses causing relapses.

He saw that happen and basically forced me to start eating again because he was worried about me etc. I\u2019ve gained about a stone since then and I just feel fucking horrible. \n\nWe\u2019ve been together for about 2 and a half years and our sex life has been non-existent for a couple of months now, but lacking for maybe 4-6 months. It\u2019s partially due to stress I think, but largely due to my body image issues. Like, I just cringe at the thought of the areas I\u2019m self-conscious about being touched. He says he feels rejected and unloved by me because there\u2019s very little physical intimacy at all right now.\n\nAnyway, he\u2019s asked what would solve the issue and after several discussions I\u2019ve just been like, you know fucking what? Starving myself would solve the issue. That\u2019s about it. \n\nSo he\u2019s basically said that he doesn\u2019t approve, but if I genuinely think that it would make things better between us physically, then he\u2019ll turn a blind eye. He specified that he\u2019d prefer me to eat at least 800 calories per day, but I think the implication is he wouldn\u2019t stop me from going lower. \n\nI\u2019m kind of conflicted now because it\u2019s like, that IS what I want to do, and not having to actively hide it is perfect, but it just feels fucking shit that he saw what my relapse put me through and he\u2019s just willing for that to happen again if it means we get to have sex? He says it\u2019s about the physical intimacy between us specifically rather than sex in general (at one point I offered to let him sleep w other people because I\u2019ve never needed to be monogamous and he turned that down) but it still makes me feel really weird. I just feel like if I thought there was something vital that was missing from the relationship that he had to starve himself in order for us to get back, then I\u2019d sooner break up with him than threaten his health or wellbeing. \n\nDunno if I\u2019m just venting or if wanting people\u2019s thoughts but like.

There was only 1 slice of pizza left in the box &amp; one croissant left and I ate the rest of the no bake cookies. \n\nThing is, I tried convincing myself not to eat EVERY SINGLE THING I ate.

I told my grandma about it &amp; it was fine. \n\nBut now since there wasn\u2019t really anything in the house she got upset and was asking who ate it and I honestly felt too ashamed to admit it (and I don\u2019t want her to think I\u2019m a pig, even though I am) ... \n\nShe doesn\u2019t like my sister.

I knew I shouldn\u2019t have done that but I did it anyways. I\u2019ve cried several times since then &amp; she keeps pointing it out and rubbing it in and I feel so bad. Knowing her, she\u2019s probably not going to stop talking about this for the next 3 months.\n\nShe also ran to the grocery store and I requested Diet Coke &amp; almondmilk and she got the wrong kind of almondmilk (silk instead of blue diamond &amp; its 60 cals instead of 30) it\u2019s OKAY but when I told her it was the wrong brand she started telling me \u201cyou\u2019re just going to have to eat what I do! I can\u2019t afford this expensive shit.\u201d which I mean is fair, I guess. It just makes me feel so upset. I can\u2019t bring myself to drink the almondmilk. I wish I could but the thought fucking terrifies me\n\nNot only this, but she never acknowledges when I starve myself outside of this. The doctor literally advised her to put me in inpatient because I told my counselor and she just ignores it. It\u2019s been over a year of me starving &amp; binging &amp; starving &amp; binging yet she HAS NEVER ONCE ACKNOWLEDGED IT. She\u2019s always just focusing on how much I eat. I.e. I ate at a restaurant ! I must be fine and totally not have an eating disorder.\n\nFuck, man. I just feel like garbage right now.

Kefir - It's like an arab yogurt, super low in calories and helped me a lot (bit expensive where I live, so I can't buy it all the time).\n3. Castor Oil - Natural oil that have a mild laxative effect. The taste is horrendous and you have to eat a little snack right after or brush your teeth twice.\n4. Erva-de-bicho (hydropiper) - Don't actually know how to translate this word, but you can Google it to see if there's a similar product in your area.

Like yes I know about how it can hurt someone and I 100% emphasize and am not trying to undermine anyone\u2019s journey towards self love\n\nBut people try to constantly compare the two, and it\u2019s like I know dang well that people who get upset at skinny shaming, and get called out by other saying that skinny has always been the standard, are the ones who use the argument \u201cbut thick is the standard now!!!!\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s true!! Thicker bodies r starting to be idealized in society too!! But there\u2019s a very big difference between being thick and being fat (not saying that thick people don\u2019t get shamed too) \n\nThick is having fat in all the right places: ur butt ur boobs, all the right places!! Being fat is having fat EVERYWHERE from ur stomach to your thighs!!! having love handles, having double chins!!! \n\nso to me when skinny people talk about being shamed and it being just as bad as fat shaming, I wanna ask them: okay, if you think it\u2019s just as bad (or worse), would you rather be fat or skinny??? not THICK, just fat. what would you rather be??? (And it would have No Influence on so-called \u201chealth\u201d but that\u2019s a whole other rant) \n\nI am pretty darn sure they are aware of society\u2019s standards enough to wanna choose being skinny. And not fat. When they say they get shamed, I believe them, but as someone who has been both fat and skinny, I know that I much rather prefer being skinny or at least skinnIER???? Ppl treated me so much better, doctors appointments were about ACTUAL SICKNESS BESIDES MY WEIGHT (and it was definitely not affecting my health, I was an athlete, if anything I had more health issues when I was thinner bc of the restricting) \n\nso tldr; I understand body shaming of any kind is bad, but it is sometimes frustrating when skinny/thin people believe that skinny shaming is AS BAD AS fat shaming", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

It\u2019s as if you\u2019re transported to some sort of euphoria whilst binging - typically why most bulimics binge on high-sugar and high-fat food. Once these pathways are formed (coupled with the emotional \u2018high\u2019), it\u2019s extremely hard to break them and certainly won\u2019t be accomplished within the first few attempts at recovery. We have huge self-loathing, disgust, shame, a desire to change but it's incredibly hard to break free.     \n&gt;  \n&gt;I know you don't mean harm, but tour advice for me to stop eating, focus on my shame or do disordered eating practices like eating in front of a mirror is offensive and harmful to me.     \n&gt;  \n&gt;If I were to alter your words to your situation, it would be like me saying, \"What I would like to understand is why, if you think you were skinny, and maybe you were skinny, why you would gag and not want to eat?  Are you not shamed enough for being skinny and never been on a date?  I would think you would HATE being skinny at that point. Why can't you focus on that? (I say that as meekly as possible). I really want to understand the psychology of hating what you are doing to yourself, but no real effort to eat more and not be skinny.  I really think you should close your eyes and eat more delicious food!  I sympathize with you, but I do not get it and have a really hard time feeling empathy, when my brain says \"that's crazy.\"\"", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

But then I started getting into fitness and nutrition and then started to feel the need to lose weight and tone up.\n\nI worked out 4-6 days a week since february. I took baby steps because I started from scratch, I had been sedentary for years. I gained 10lbs within 3 months of attending college and to my surprise I kept it on. I looked \u201chealthier\u201d which was an insult to me since I was so used to being called skinny. I knew I was gaining muscle though because besides visibly seeing it, I felt my strength. I developed stamina and endurance. I ate healthier with and without counting calories (this was before I became consistent within the last 2 months).\n\nLast month I was feeling discouraged that after months of working out and having a calorie restriction plan for \u201ccutting\u201d long term, I felt like I wasn\u2019t making progress. I thought I looked fat. I was so sad and started restricting fairly heavy. I used my anorexia as a coping mechanism for emotional problems instead of confronting them head on.\n\nLast weekend my parents picked me up from college and while staying at a hotel I saw my body in the mirror and was surprised to see abs. Visible abs. I wasn\u2019t super skinny, but I was toned in all the right places. All the places I had hoped for before my fitness journey. Before the anorexia too. Even though my body isn\u2019t my thinspo, it still looks great! I\u2019m a 26in waist right now but I started at 28in.\n\nI still have aesthetic goals I want to work towards but I love my body right now. I love my newfound strength and curves (even if it comes in thicker thighs). I want to redevelop a healthier mindset to weight loss and aesthetic goals. I have hard limits for what I\u2019m willing to do to achieve these \u201cgoals\u201d &amp; wtf these goals even add to my life. These next 2 weeks I\u2019m dedicating to maintenance. I didn\u2019t track calories a single day so far. I tried... but it\u2019s not realistic to estimate fucking everything I have been eating lately. That\u2019s another thing I don\u2019t want to count calories for the rest of my life. Sure I might do CICO for another year but after that I want something that is mentally and physically sustainable long-term.\n\nI\u2019m just relieved that I like my body and feel connected to it once again. Maybe this is temporary but nonetheless still eye-opening. I was so scared I could never love myself unless I had a 23in waist and certain bmi but I am no longer defining my worth based on arbitrary numbers. I\u2019m defining my progress in terms of health in those ways either. And maybe this is fucked up, but I\u2019m grateful for the lessons my anorexic tendencies have taught me. Coming from an obese family who had bad knowledge on nutrition I\u2019m glad I know about CICO because now I know that for my body I do want to eat a certain number of calories for sufficient nutrients but not overeat (I\u2019ve also struggled with emotional overeating). I also know that 1-2 hours of activity is great for the body. This isn\u2019t mind blowing information but I feel like I have autonomy over my health for once. And I know EDs are how we get control in our lives but I\u2019m just feeling grateful for a lot right now.

I'm 14, and obviously new to this forum.\n\nNot totally sure how to start this, but I'll give it a go. So, about a year back, I was living with my mom, her abusive boyfriend, and my little sister. Their fights were triggered by small things, and it was tough and scary to be around. I felt lost, useless, and like i had no place. As some do, I went to food as a comfort. I would eat when I felt bored, tired, any time of the day, you name it. While doing this... I gained almost 10 pounds that year. Suddenly a weight of 136. Suddenly I realized and felt disgusted with myself. No later did I begin eating extremely healthy and exercising everyday. All was well, I was NOT in a calorie deficit, and I dropped the weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr so I thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApparently my mother didn't believe I looked any different. She told me I was chubby, out of shape and could loose an extra few numbers. It pained me to hear, and would stare at my body in the mirror for hours on end, picking at the little fat on my stomach and covering myself with my own hair. Through this, they continued to fight. Mostly verbal, but sometimes in a physically way. I remember the police being called a few nights. And the last night they were, my uncle showed up. It seemed I forgot he worked with our city PD. I was crying terribly this time. Because not only did my mom's boyfriend hit her, but he hit me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was sent to live with my uncle and aunt. This is currently where I live.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter living there a long while, it seemed I almost forgot about my weight and the whole situation. I was finally happy, even though I missed my sister horribly, I was able to visit her for lunch and such. My aunt would compliment me everyday, tell me I was beautiful and talk to me about whatever I wanted. One day in the kitchen I remembered over-hearing her talk to my uncle about a diet called 'keto' she was soon to be going on. It immediately made my heart race. I pinched myself, told my thoughts no, but like you must think, I researched. Andddd.... long story short, I ate like the diet told me to for three long months. I dropped 16 pounds. (126)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClean eating turned to calorie counting and health turned careless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I go weeks eating in a calorie deficit (300-900 cals) and then go binge for a day or two. I feel gross, though maintain a steady weight (120) and frequently despise it. My aunt had figured out what I was doing and gave me a lecture like its in my 'god-given power' to change this and eat normal. But when I do, I vomit all of it up. I feel scared of gaining, losing, *dying,* and most of all hurting my family and friends. I don't want to stand up and be dizzy any more.

{"post_id": "cbsrb2", "created_utc": 1562829848, "title": "Little Rant + Day To Day Update Thread", "author": "96Nathan96", "self_text": "Hey guys,\n\nI just finished a little binge (actually, a big binge). I don't really feel sad or anything because I have a plan (my fridge is fully locked, and I put the keys in my heavy duty timed safe. My card has transaction limits and I never have one anyways - I'm going to give my IDs to my older sister so I can't ever go to the bank. If I want to indulge, I'm only doing it if she buys it for me (she's really supportive of me. She helps me strengthen my mind and better my life so that I can ditch the binging + she supports me on my bodybuilding dream).\n\nBinging today honestly was really tasty, and it was nice to not deal with hunger at all. But sabotage doesn't really taste all that nice. I'm not particularly disappointed in myself. I'm just going to let myself live life. Yeah I'm going to drop like 20-30lbs (and look super slim again) because I deserve it and well... why not? I'll still be at a healthy weight (actually healthier). \n\nI've been reflecting on how much of a dummy my old therapist was. To give you a bit of background on me, I am well-versed in human physiology and nutrition. I can essentially tell you how to lose weight and/or build muscle. What I can't tell you is how to hang in there when it gets tough and truly love yourself enough to break detrimental habits. I found it really funny how my old therapist had the audacity to give me nutritional advice, saying that \"I'm eating below my setpoint.\" I posted earlier about this idiot and how she compared a sustainable diet on someone with some excess fat to the Minnesota starvation experiment. I found it especially funny when she asked me about my parents (my mother is a former binger, had had several heart attacks, type-2 diabetes still morbidly obese - doesn't believe she deserves happiness in any way. My father came from a third world country and treats food as if it is extremely scarce, he believes everything is a struggle, and that happiness is too difficult to accomplish. He has alarmingly high blood pressure, and abnormally high stress levels). She said that my body should gravitate towards being similar to theirs (aka being obese and getting destroyed extremely quickly due to LIFESTYLE FACTORS).\n\n...Woman, I didn't eat rotten vegetables from a garbage can due to dangerously low body fat levels and a forced extremely low caloric diet. I ordered a large pizza, garlic bread,  had two packs of ice cream sandwiches as an appetizer, and downed it with cheesecake because I was bored and because I sometimes don't believe I'm strong enough to break detrimental habits. Your clients \"don't like\" the idea of a set point because your idea that the \"human body has a specific weight it wants to he at\" isn't quite true. Yes there are physiological factors (our bodies are literally not quite yet physiologically designed 100% for all of our food options), but the set point is mostly  caused by psychological habits. Change them, you change your weight. I have a fitness coach who is helping holding me accountable and is helping me adopt the mindset I struggle to regain, that me living a healthy, fit lifestyle is a possible reality that I am capable of creating. He's had my back more than my therapist did, and I find I've been really moved by his podcasts (he interviews people who were similar to me, but ended up becoming successful).\n\nI'm really happy that I can full on delay binges using physical methods of distancing myself away from them. It's a great bandaid approach, and I'm not ashamed to say that I like the bandaid approach, especially because 1) I'm still learning how to heal myself, which is way easier when there are little to no relapses 2) I don't have a therapist - I'm glad she's leaving the country, as I would probably give her a drink contaminated by spit and drop her sorry self and 3) ...I like saving money. \n\nI'm unhappy about how I often feel like I'm not powerful enough to make the right decisions when I go to a grocery store - and that my father essentially just enables me if I do decide to binge eat. Since I seem to be so good at sabotaging, I utilized my skills and sabotaged my next binge, which would've been the next time my father came to buy me groceries - my friend is going to monitor me while I pick them out. I'm also unhappy that I often treat myself with a victim like mentality even though... I'm the perpetrator! At the end of the day, it is still me who chooses to shovel down an entire cheesecake. I'm taking responsibility for the damage I've done. I caused a problem, and I'm going to fix it. Yeah, I am going to lose weight, but that's going to be a side thing. I'm sick of living life counting binge days vs non binge days, forcing myself on boring walks, and feeling like a slave to a body fat percentage. I'm going to do what worked for me - I'm going to live life, and let the weight loss just come to me.\n\nSomething about wishing it were this time last year just doesn't do it for me anymore. Something about stuffing myself and causing damage just doesn't make me feel alive anymore.\n\nI'm going to update this post on the daily. I'll tell you what I did. Who knows? I may just end up going a long time. My immediate cosmetic vision is to look and feel confident enough to cosplay as Majima from Yakuza. Another vision of mine is to be able to partake in family get togethers and not overindulge, just like what I used to do. To have that \"Yeah I'll binge tomorrow... I just don't feel like it today.\" Lately for the physical I'm learning to treat hunger, exhaustion, and dehydration as \"no biggie\". Tomorrow I'm forcing myself to face whatever boredom comes my way. Lately for the mental I am learning that I don't need to feel unworthy and ashamed (like my father + therapist made me feel) of wanting to live a healthy, active lifestyle.\n\nTomorrow is my final final boring day. I plan on playing Final Fantasy X-2, getting myself better acquainted with Hamasaki Ayumi's music, and yeah. After that, my full time job starts. That with volunteering = happy, busy me= morphing into my healthy, true self that loves himself.\n\nSee you then.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

This mentality got me through working full time through my bachelor's degree, pulling 100 hour weeks, and basically my whole career. It is, honestly, the person I see myself as.

I've been dealing with an eating disorder for a few years, which causes me to have periods where I starve myself and purge everything I eat, but I've been in recovery and have been getting better at combating my ED voice. I'm currently studying abroad over the summer and dealing with the recurrence of ED thoughts and actions. I live in a host house with a cohort of three other people. I don't have control over my meals or really my schedule, which is hard to deal with. Before this trip, I saw a therapist and hung out with a few friends who knew about my disorder. But, on this trip, I've subconsciously let ED thoughts take over, in response to some unintentionally hurtful comments about weight and exercise. I've realized just today that I justify my food intake by the number of calories I burn or steps I take in a day. Today, I purged for the first time in a month in the middle of a run, in response to other students making comments about my (slower) running pace and doing badly at the beginning of the run. The lack of control, my anger about it, and feelings of inadequacy are compiling, and I feel about to spiral. I know it's for such a stupid reason. I'm in a country where malnutrition is a huge issue, so I would feel like a brat for talking to someone about it. I'm also chubbier than the other students, so I feel like people would not take me seriously.

I don't feel comfortable talking to anyone I know at the moment and I also don't want to go to like a doctor or therapist yet, I just want to let it all out to people who have been through it and get some advice.\n\nSo, a few years ago I got really sick and and during this time I lost a lot of weight. I have never been overweight or \u201cfat\u201d, but I\u2019ve always had belly fat, I was self conscious about certain parts of my body (wouldn't think too much of it I would just hide them), my face was chubbier, etc. With the illness, I lost so much I was borderline underweight. My condition is pretty stable right now and with time I have been able to gain little by little. While the weight loss was something that just happened out of my control and not something I was trying to do, I did like that I had lost some weight. For the first time since I was a child I really liked how I looked. I was happy, I could finally wear clothes I wouldn\u2019t have ever worn before. I look back at pictures from before I got sick and I am terrified of going back to looking how I did. That's my fear.\n\nFor a while now I have been measuring different parts of my body and weighing myself multiple times a day because I don\u2019t want to gain. An ounce of a difference makes me feel super ashamed. My weight is fine right now but I have naturally gained some fat back and maybe a few pounds more than I would have personally liked. I\u2019m still \u201cskinny\u201d but now when I look in the mirror or back at pictures from a few months ago I\u2019m not as thin as I was. I also don't want to go back to extreme because it was a \"sick thin\" look I had at the peak of my illness, but I\u2019m scared to go back to how I was before it.\n\nI feel like with all of this my metabolism has taken a toll. I\u2019ve tried different things like exercise, intermittent fasting or eating low calories. Right now I\u2019m eating the recommended calories to lose 1/2 lb per week but I\u2019m not. I can be eating healthy and clean, and even below what is recommended (!!), and the numbers on the scale barely move. Then I\u2019ll have a day where I eat extra or I\u2019m out and about and I eat a box of cookies or something and suddenly I\u2019m bloated and extremely guilty. This happened about 2 weeks ago, I gained about 1.5 lbs from it and I haven\u2019t been able to shed it still. I see other people around me who eat whatever they want, unhealthy junk/fast food and they don\u2019t gain anything at all (maybe a few ounces but they lose it back within a day or two). Their weight is steady but me, I eat a restricted diet and if I go over by even 1 calorie one day I gain. \n\nI feel like all I have been thinking about is planning my meals, counting calories and macros, and planning my days around my meals. Sometimes I feel like eating a certain food but I don\u2019t because it\u2019s x amount of calories or carbs. Then one day maybe I do give in, and then I eat more than I should, gain, and feel super guilty. It\u2019s like a never ending cycle and I\u2019m getting so tired. I keep telling my self that if I could get to a certain weight and maintain it I\u2019ll be happy, but slowly my weight is coming up, and a little bit of fat is coming back too. Sometimes I am able to snap my self out of it, but sometimes I can\u2019t help feeling bad about everything. Sometimes I\u2019m hungry but I'll hold it for hours because I feel like it hasn\u2019t been enough time since my last meal, or I\u2019ll weight myself before eating and it\u2019ll be up, so I feel guilty about eating and don't.\n\nI just want to be able to enjoy eating normally and guilt-free. Before I used to eat without thinking about it and I used to eat what I actually felt like eating and wanted and I always weighed the same. I just want to get to a point where I can maintain where I am now and not gain but be able to enjoy life and food without having to think about it all constantly. Like for example, I was invited to an event that I\u2019m really excited and really want to go, but even so I\u2019m already trying to plan how much I\u2019ll eat even though I just want to enjoy the day, but I know I will feel like I went overboard and guilty afterwards no matter what. I don\u2019t want to feel like this anymore. Right now I\u2019m craving something but I\u2019m trying so, so hard not to give in. I just want to eat but I don\u2019t want to gain. And I feel like this even if it is something healthy! If it\u2019s over a certain amount of calories even if it\u2019s a special day or a healthy meal, I will feel hesitant, guilty, and do everything I can to avoid eating it or getting to a place where I will be tempted. My BMI right now is like 20.4, but I feel like I would be more content if it were in the 19's. I still feel pretty ok about my body and of course I'm nowhere near how I was before I got sick (my BMI back then was probably in the 23 to lower 24 range), my fear is just watching the numbers on the scale slowly (or worse, quickly) creep up and looking chubbier all while still being super restricted and hungry and everything. I also see how some people with ED on youtube have to eat a bunch of calories to recover but I'm scared because I'm not underweight, so if I had to do this I will definitely gain a bunch and be super close to how I was before. I just don't know what to do and would really appreciate some advice.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I guess it stems from two things--so many memories of my mom being cruel and condescending because I was a chubby kid, and the knowledge of how much I changed when I started to hyper-focus on my body.  I suppose my experience with body issues has been being bullied or being my own bully, and I'm anxious that my boyfriend will go down one of those two routes.\n\nWow, sorry to ramble.  I'm a mess right now.  I just wonder...how can I better?  How can I support my boyfriend in his health journey *and* keep my sanity?  How can I separate my historical issues from the present?\n\nTL;DR My boyfriend wants to get in shape and gain weight for health reasons.

I\u2019ve never posted here before and I\u2019d like to talk a little about my life so here goes\n\nI\u2019m a 20 y/o female and I\u2019ve struggled with disordered eating for about 10 years now. I\u2019m 5\u20193\u201d and moderately overweight. I wasn\u2019t raised learning how to make healthy, balanced choices.  I was fed bagels, sugary cereal. mac and cheese, and pizza for the majority of my childhood. That\u2019s not an exaggeration. It wasn\u2019t a matter of being picky, that\u2019s just what was easiest for my parents. I\u2019m not trying to push blame but I feel like that\u2019s how everything got started. By the time I learned what types of food and how much of it were appropriate to maintain a healthy lifestyle, I was already addicted to food. \n\nI\u2019m an impulsive and emotional eater and I can\u2019t help but think about it for an absurd amount of time each day. Nobody in my life understands how much anxiety I get having to walk through the dining hall at college. Or why \u201cwhat do you want for dinner?\u201d is such a difficult question for me to answer. I want to have a healthy relationship with food. Despite my efforts I\u2019m at an all time low right now and i\u2019m not sure where to turn or how to help myself. I\u2019ve mentioned therapy to my parents and they ignored me (they don\u2019t like acknowledging stressful things) and I\u2019m not even sure if that\u2019s even the path I need/want. \n\nOn top of this, I was diagnosed a type 1 diabetic about 2 years ago, which entails having to know exactly how many carbohydrates I eat at each meal in order to correctly give myself insulin via injection. I can\u2019t eat without having to first consider that, which furthers my disordered habits. \n\nI\u2019m home for the summer and it\u2019s been very difficult to not overeat, especially having no food in the kitchen and a family who needs help as well. While away at school, I have more urges to under-eat but still usually overeat and this stressful cycle really affects my day to day life. I\u2019ve talked about needing some support and possibly eating healthier with my family but they don\u2019t see this as a big deal, or they\u2019re too anxious about other things to consider how I feel. I know i\u2019m old enough to make decisions on my own but what I need right now is to figure out my next steps because i\u2019m at a loss. \n\nThere\u2019s so much more I could say but I think that\u2019s an alright summary.

I thought I wouldn't need inpatient because I'm medically stable and all my labs are normal and I'm not suicidal, but the doctors are concerned about potential refeeding syndrome.\n\nOn top of all of this, I'm only 18 and have no support from my parents. They are abusive and don't believe in mental health issues (southeast Asian culture). I'm currently a college student and I had to medically withdraw from summer school to pursue treatment. My parents still have no idea I even have anorexia, let alone that I've withdrawn from school and that I'm going inpatient.\n\nI feel so lost right now. I'm super scared.

Not sure what is wrong specifically, I'll find that out at physio. All I know is that it's painful, and my doctor said to dial my running right back. He said I have to wait until it stops hurting to try and run at all, then only run a mile at a time, barely faster than walking pace, and I have to build it back up from there whilst having the physio to strengthen everything.\n\nIt's not that I don't want to eat without exercising, or that I am afraid to gain weight if I eat when not being able to run as much or anything like that. It's that I am absolutely crushed and saddened that I can't run. Running was my *thing*. It was keeping me *well*, I was able to be more at peace with my weight gain and current body weight/size/shape, by seeing my running improve and enjoying my hobby way more than ever. It made me feel I was getting my life back, that I was more than just dieting and a body shape. It was making me happy, for all the right reasons. It was helping me. I actually gained more weight after starting to run again because my appetite increased and I made sure I ate more when it did. Running was my happy place.\n\nAnd now I can't do it, at least for possibly a long while, and that hurts mentally/emotionally... and I want the hurt the stop. To focus on something else so I don't have to focus on the fact I can't enjoy running and numb myself to how much that's upsetting me. \n\nOther activity/exercise wont help how I feel emotionally... because again, it's not about the calorie burn, or increasing fitness, or anything like that. It was about how running specifically made me feel emotionally/mentally... it helped me so much. Other forms of exercise don't give me the same good feeling, at all. \n\nAnd so I am sitting here and I just want to stop eating. Just to have something else 'important' to fill my day up. And I dunno if I can fight this one, this time. I have won so many battles in my recovery so far, but this one is too big. \n\nI revived my World of Warcraft account to try and distract myself get 'get into' something else I used to enjoy a lot (video games general), but it made my old clunking laptop way overheat, it's unplayable lol.

You can be diagnosed with Bulimia if you restrict and over exercise not have never puked. At the same time, you can be diagnosed with just anorexia even if you exercise, throw up every meal, and restrict.

Huh, wha, where am I?\" and a nurse said that the surgery was successful and I said \"Thank God!\" I was really woozy and disoriented, honestly felt like I was just extremely high and then I noticed my mouth was dry and I looked around for the nurse and I looked her in the eye and said \"Where did all my saliva go?!\" and she laughed and said she'd get me some water. I just kept whining about having no saliva and they thought it was kinda funny (it was)\n\nThe doctor came in to discuss how the surgery went and ended up telling me my gallbladder was extremely infected and it was very lucky I came in when I did.

When viewed on desktop, the flair is red and makes the post link greyed out, so it's easier to avoid if necessary.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We encourage you to flair your posts manually, but we also have a TW automod. It scans for \"TW:\", \"trigger warning\" or \"content warning\" in either the post title or body. It then flairs the post as \"TW\" and marks it as a spoiler. (Thanks to the brilliant u/TotallyNotARadar)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We are working to incorporate a \"view all content MINUS \\[TW flair\\]\" link in the sidebar- will update this post if successful.\n\n# Rule 2. No thinspo.\n\n**Your role: do NOT name/link thinspo celebrities or media.**\n\n&gt;We are expanding the \"no thinspo\" rule to include NO naming/linking thinspo celebrities or media. You may freely discuss these in other platforms or subreddits, but r/EDAnonymous is not the place to do so, for the survival of our sub.\n\n# Rule 4. Strictly no subreddit drama.\n\n**Your role: do NOT mentioning (explicitly or implicitly), complain about or brigade other subs**\n\n&gt;Other EDA members most likely have seen or agree with your stance on fasting / calorie restriction / body image subreddits- but please don't let our sub be a subreddit drama echo chamber as this behaviour may endanger our sub. We don't want to fall under the banhammer.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is particularly with regards to subreddits like r/fasting, r/omad, r/1200isplenty, r/fatlogic etc.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Do NOT talk about other subreddits unless you endorse the sub as a good resource.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Do NOT try to skirt this rule by saying things like \"from a sub that encourages abstinence from food \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\" or \"rhymes with bwelve zundred his slenty\". You may be temp banned.\n\n# Fun stuff: new sidebar widgets, discord, design our sub\n\n**Your role: check em out!**\n\n* I've added new sidebar widgets which are viewable on desktop.\n\n&gt;\\~ \"sort by flair\" box for easy navigation  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\~ \"related communities\" box with subreddits categorised under \"other ED\", \"recovery\" and \"other mental health\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Our[ discord](https://discord.gg/yVvG5pK) is still open with games organised by u/Bleare :)\n* If you'd like to help create a custom icon and header for our sub, [message the mod team here!](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/EDAnonymous) (credit will be given as due in the sidebar/wiki!)", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I made a little program which spiders Peach and tries to pull the bio for every user on the network. Didn't work too well (so many errors) but I did get a lot of data. No hacking or invasive stuff was done to collect data since all bios are already public. Also, if you're concerned, while I am storing this data for future stats work I am holding it without any usernames attached to it so it isn't personally identifiable. Finally, since this is just publicly available data though, the quality and accuracy is really also questionable (which I'll get into later).\n\n\nTime for some analysis! \n\n(Un?)fortunately, most people on Peach (32.5k) have their bios empty and so I couldn't perform any analysis at all. I filtered these people out. Next I searched through the data set for bios including any of a varied set of disordered terms (\"MPA\", \"EDAnon\", \"ProED\", \"cw:\", \"gw:\", and so on). In total, I found 2.5k matching accounts which are likely operated by people suffering from some form of an eating disorder and are public about it. This is of course greatly eclipsed by the 32.6k likely non-disordered accounts. Based on the accounts I was able to make valid guesses about (35k), we can guess that Peach is at least 4% and at most ~7% ED related accounts. \n\nI do, however, suspect that this is a fairly poor estimate because it relies on keyword matching and people putting terms in their bios. Just scrolling through my list, quite a few of who frequently post ED related stuff were not counted because their bios did not include any disordered terms. It's completely reasonable, of course, not to include ED terms in your bio because there is (citation needed) a possibility of living a normal life beyond a disorder. \n\nSo, final data table:\n\nCategory | Count\n--------|-----\nED | 2,577\nNON-ED | 32,590\nUNCLASSIFIABLE | 32,547\nTOTAL ACCOUNTS | 67,714\n\n\nAnyways, not a data scientist or anything so legit have no idea what I'm doing.

{"post_id": "ccvwc6", "created_utc": 1563059674, "title": "Down over 150 lb, but binging again", "author": "Aromatic_Jellyfish", "self_text": "\nAfter a life of unhealthy eating, early last year I started eating much more mindfully and carefully. I had a much improved lifestyle -- I have been a ton more active, having much better sleep habits, etc. I had left a high-stress, not-encouraging-of-good-choices-catered-lunch-provided job and moved to a new city; this juncture provided a chance to reboot my lifestyle, which I did with surprising success.\n\nI made it the better part of the year before any real slip-ups. There were a few indulgent days, as life can bring, but even those were good overall, not binges. Still, I could tell the monster was alive inside me. In the past several months, I had a couple binges. Overall, even those days weren't so bad calorically, when I polished off smores supplies after a party or even downed a bunch of sweets after dropping a friend at the airport. A common trigger was entertaining out-of-town guests--balancing eating around them when they had more indulgent 'vacation' needs seemed more dealable than just the overall stress that entertaining was giving me.\n\nThe last couple months, I could feel the binging behavior creep back, though I aimed it at things like sugar-free drinks and jello and gum, which didn't actually interfere with my weight goals. I could feel my self-control no longer be as strong as its high watermark, certainly when it came to things like sub-portions, where I used to be able to eat part of a container of yogurt as a snack or half of a large sub I ordered. I was more prone to eat more 'volume' meals, where I had large amounts of vegetables. I had basically eliminated visually small meals, as I was seeking more and more the need to stuff things down my gullet.\n\nI was dreading the last couple weeks in a way, for how they would interfere with my diet and exercise routines. I had a week of vacation visiting various friends and a week of working at a different office of my company. It was a huge effort to stick to my dietary needs and not completely fall off my exercise routine (which suffered some) during the personal trip, but it was actually the latter part where I fell off the wagon entirely.\n\nThis last week\n\n**Sunday** Traveled to the city where I would be working with a personal friend. We went to a good local place for lunch. What I ordered was heavier than I expected. I ate every bit of it, even the parts I shouldn't have that I wasn't extracting joy from. Responsible dinner. After my friend left, I tried to work out some, but it was a short workout. I grabbed some candy/yogurt/gum for the week from the office (where I was using the gym) that were normally just the sort of thing I have had around. I bought a couple protein bars. I ended up eating both protein bars, a bad-tasting minibar protein bar, and all the aforementioned snacks.\n\n**Monday** Responsible lunch. Gym was shockingly busy, I felt uncomfortable; light workout. Couple reasonable snacks (fruit). Responsible dinner with friends -- I wish I could have had a somewhat more indulgent dinner, but I wasn't in the mood to enjoy it. Went around town after friends left, binged 8 protein bars.\n\n**Tuesday -- very shameful day** Snacked on fruit earlier than usual, usually skip breakfast, but if I feel like something some fruit or a hard-boiled egg are normal. Typical salad for lunch, with some fruit. After breaking with my lunch partner, snuck more salad and fruit. I started eating chocolate trail mix in the afternoon. I returned to different snack kitchens to take more and more and more. Cups and cups of trail mix. Then I ate a bowl of cocoa crispies (organic knockoff) closer to dinner. Then I tried to eat a salad. I was so full I could hardly swallow. I knew I shouldn't be eating, I was meeting a friend for dinner. I was in such pain. I couldn't eat with my friend. I considered inducing vomitting just to try to release the pressure; if this did not align with such unhealthy behavior patterns, I might have. I was so ashamed that my binging made my meeting with my friend odd. By the end of our visit, I was tempted to eat more trail mix.\n\n**Wednesday** Extra-big salad for lunch, constant snacking on healthy stuff veg/fruit/lean-meat. Fancy dinner, was ordered family style, overate in a way that would be fine to as part of a balanced lifestyle, though a bit more mindfulness would be nice. Wandered the town in search of protein bars, ate 4 bars and a pint of ice cream.\n\n**Thursday** Massive binge day. Ate 4 peanut butter cups, half a PB&amp;J, 2.5x granola bars, an apple, and a mixed fruit cup as breakfast. Intended to pack two salads from the salad bar for airport/plane eating for lunch/dinner. I had already binged cookies, rolls, cakes, etc. before leaving for the airport. I took a slice of pizza (which was bad and I didn't eat all of, though one bite should have been enough) and a personal quiche (which was so-so and I only took a few bites of). I even had a few bites of the trail mix from Tuesday. So many sweets, I felt sick. I was eating my salad as I was packing it. I ate one salad and the fruit cup I took before getting on my plane. I ate the rest way early on the flight. I ordered a snack box and accepted the trail mix on the flight. I had terrible gas the whole time and felt so bad for the person next to me. I tried to tell myself that I was home and it was all over, but at home I ate over half a box of cereal.\n\n**Friday** Back to work. I made my typical salad at the salad bar, but bigger than I should have. Resisted team donut day. Ate some strawberries as an afternoon snack. No workout, which was unusual, but did some errands and made a reasonable dinner. I sat there, noticing the satiety. Was I back on track? I binged on cereal (&gt;1200 kcal of cereal alone) and yogurt and peanut butter and yogurt and fruit and cheese until I felt awful.\n\n**Today** I'm over 6000 calories and still going. I feel bad. The reading on the scale has spiked over 20 lbs from last week. I'm out of control.\n\nI had been afraid this day would come. I look forward to conquering it, and knowing I have that power, but it's frustrating to be confronted with my weakness and illness.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I dont know who she thinks she's fooling...She eats so little. She spends a long ass time cutting up food into tiny pieces and then chewing it for a really long time. She prepares elaborate foods for the family and eats a quarter plate of leftovers. She orders things at restaurants without cheese and oil for no reason (i.e. no intolerance/allergy and she used to really enjoy these foods). She force feeds me and my sister and barely takes any food for herself. I'm like, come on, i know exactly what you're doing because I used to do that too (still do sometimes). And it honestly breaks my heart but she won't listen to anyone and seems totally convinced that her weight loss has nothing to do with her dietary habits.

I enjoy being active - rock climbing, weight lifting, and I am training for a half marathon. \n\nMy concern is I spend a lot of time thinking and stressing over losing weight. I still don't feel small or skinny, even though logically I know I have to be since I am close to being underweight. I want to lose a few more pounds and maintain at the lowest end of healthy. I do not desire to be extremely thin. \n\nI count calories, and weigh everything I eat to the gram. I have a very slow deficit set as my goal, but I have not been getting close to meeting my goal lately as I am eating less and less. It's this horrible cycle because as I eat less, I see faster results with my weight loss so it encourages me to eat even less the next day.  am starting to feel run down and exhausted, which has never happened before. I know I am not eating enough, especially with the amount of exercise I do. Of note, I have an IUD so I never have a period which is normal. \n\nI am becoming very uncomfortable because every day at work someone is making a comment about me \"withering away,\" asking if my weight loss is intentional, or just saying they are concerned with my weight. I am a quiet person and I don't like attention, so this has been very challenging for me. I am a medical provider, so I know the diagnostic criteria for eating disorders, but I do not neatly fit into any one of them. I'm not sure if I am just a weight conscious athlete who needs to force myself to step away from calorie counting/daily weighing myself/focusing on weight loss, or if I actual do have a problem that needs to be addressed with a counselor. I feel like I could stop if necessary, but I have a strong desire not to. \n\nThanks.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

Some info first:\n\nI started my REAL recovery in April. I say real bc in the the past I thought restriction was recovery. The difference this time was that I let go of the hatred for my body and weight because I was fed up with this cycle of constant weight gain and weight loss on repeat. OF COURSE I would rather weigh less but not more than I want to concur this demon and actually love myself.\n\nIt\u2019s worked out pretty well all things considered. I haven\u2019t been able to do cardio because I was recovering from an injury and know from surgery so that\u2019s been a bit of an obstacle but I\u2019ve only binged twice since April! I have had some days where I overeat by a lot but I\u2019m happy to say I haven\u2019t eaten to the point where I\u2019m in pain, I haven\u2019t purged, I haven\u2019t fallen into that mind space where I\u2019m obsessing over food, and I haven\u2019t restricted myself to compensate for the days I overate (I\u2019m extra proud of that one) . All huge accomplishments for me. \n\nMy thought process through this has been to avoid anything that\u2019ll get me in the binge/restrict cycle again which is why I don\u2019t punish myself or diet at all. Most days that works out great, I eat like a \u201cnormal\u201d person.\n\nSo here\u2019s my thing - my surgeon is letting me begin to do moderate exercise. I feel comfortable enough in my body but I have some extra weight that I would like to start working off. Typically I have an athletic figure (even when I\u2019m pretty overweight) because I\u2019m very muscular but I have been out of shape for months now from lack of exercise and my current shape is kinda stopping me from doing things I want to do. I feel genuinely okay because I know this isn\u2019t forever but the way my body looks is affecting what plans I agree to and how comfortable I am in public/seeing old friends/meeting new people. \n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about potentially starting a safe/reasonable diet but I\u2019m nervous that it will trigger my old behaviors. I\u2019ve never dieted safely but I also never had this mindset. I really would like to keep improving myself in all ways, mentally and physically. It would be devastating for me to fall back into old patterns.\n\nHas anyone here had success with ACTUAL healthy diets? Could you share your experience?

I found out I weighed 152lbs, not 143lbs, and completely spiraled. I bounced between 138lbs and 147lbs for months before I stopped weighing myself. I know I likely weighed less at one point but I don\u2019t know. I dropped out of school in February to focus on \u201crecovery.\u201d I give it quotation marks because even though I genuinely wanted to end my life I feel like it still wasn\u2019t \u201cbad enough\u201d to have to \u201crecover\u201d from.\nWhen I came home I started going on hikes to distract myself and try to find some comfort in the simplicity of nature. Things were going better, I was eating normally for the first time in months. A couple of weeks ago I decided to weigh myself and found out I\u2019d lost 10 pounds since coming home and fallen just below my (initial) GW 135lbs genuinely on accident. I never expected it. It triggered the fuck out of me. I talked to my therapist and she made it worse. I won\u2019t be going back to see her.\nNow I\u2019ve lost more weight, absolutely intentionally. I weighed 127lbs when I went to the doctor. 16 pounds lighter than I did when I went 5 months ago. I\u2019m 5\u20199, so technically still at a normal BMI, which I fucking hate. My doctor told me she\u2019s worried about my weight and she doesn\u2019t want me to lose any more. That was last week.\n\nNow, for the past few days, I\u2019ve been eating much more than I feel I should (but of course it\u2019s a normal amount). I was able to emotionally distance myself but I\u2019m feeling it get worse and taking hold. My legs *feel* fat, fatter than they\u2019ve felt in months despite being the thinnest they\u2019ve been since I was 14. It\u2019s getting more and more difficult to say no to myself when I want to go throw up the food I\u2019ve just eaten. I\u2019m 5\u20199 and I want to weigh 115 pounds. I know that when I do I will set the bar lower. I already know that unless I\u2019m able to get a hold of my disorder I will die trying to compete with my 5\u20194 grandmother\u2019s 25year old depression weight of 80 pounds.\n\nBut it feels so distant from me. It doesn\u2019t seem that that could ever be real. But I\u2019m almost underweight. My doctor told me it was very near to becoming a serious physical health concern. But it\u2019s literally almost impossible to believe. And I\u2019m going to keep losing weight.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

But I also eat.. very good.\n\nI've been interested in health and nutrition for years. I've been through phases of eating very badly because of my financial and personal situation, but it was more a laziness thing. The last few years I've hovered between eating extremely consciously and health-oriented (Intermittend Fasting, meal preps, designing meals based on nutritional values and making them in bulk, etc) and eating terribly (ordering fast food several times a week, overeating, eating an entire weeks worth of evening meal preps in one or two days).\n\nI also know part of it is poor discipline and mentality. If I get a shit day or get mentally weaker or 'down' I'll cave and eat shitty again. I'm definitely an emotional eater (or an emotional excuse maker). \n\nI worry because I should be saving several 100 dollars worth after expenses every month, and I easily spend half of that on fast food alone.

Obviously it gets to a point where it can't anymore, but during recovery it's trying to repair and also protect itself from going through anything like that again.

Well, more like I decided to go through my wardrobe and since our sizes are weirdly similar (we've both got wide hips despite difference in height, and similar waist size) I often give my clothes to her. She gets something new to wear, I get rid off stuff I don't wear anymore without throwing away good quality clothes, all is well.

Aaaand she suddenly decided to say that she was \"so visibly underweight!\". My friend is 174 cm tall and weighs about 55 kgs. And she loses weight easily, often without actively trying to. She has a thigh gap, thin ankles, narrow shoulders, long fingers, collarbones - the works. It's one thing to know this and another to hear your mother say this. God. All I want is for people to call me underweight. Me. I know she didn't mean it as a praise of any sort, rather she voiced her concern and worry about my friend's health, but still. It hurt. And then, when I dug a pair of tight white pants out of the depths of my wardrobe, they persuaded me to try them on and I spent the whole evening feeling like crap because a) I barely pulled them on when I used to button them easily and it just confirmed my weight gain and b) they proceeded to say how 'curvy' I was and started asking why wasn't I wearing pants like this more often since I have such a nice figure, meaning ass and boobs. Nevermind that I hate being \"thicc\" and all I want is this boyish, thin, flat-chested silhouette that I'll probably never have.

{"post_id": "cdhnkq", "created_utc": 1563198331, "title": "Request: Losing appetite / getting nauseous when eating in public", "author": "EDPostRequests", "self_text": " In early 2017 (I was a 17 year old male then), I felt like I started to  develop some sort of eating disorder whereby I would completely lose my  appetite when eating in public. In the past, I used to enjoy nice food  in public, used to have no issues eating with friends etc. But since  early 2017, I cant finish a proper meal in public around strangers, I  would feel full after a few mouthful of food. In worse cases, I would  have the urge of throwing up though this only happened once or twice.  Even just having a meal with close friends I would have no appetite too,  and this caused me to somewhat distance away from my friends and even  sometimes rejected when they asked me to hang out because I was scared  of feeling nauseous worrying about the meal. However when i'm at home  eating alone or with my family I have absolutely no issues and can have a  feast with no appetite problems. I suspect this \"disorder\" came about because during this period I was  extremely extremely anxious as I was about to enter military. There was a  lot of uncertainty that I had about the military and I was literally so  worried about everything regarding it, how it would be, how will I be  able manage the toughness, will I have an extremely hard time there etc.  This anxiety made me so sick to the point where I would feel nauseous  almost every day before I went to school, I even remembered on one  occasion I went to school feeling so sick that I had to go to the toilet  to throw up before going to class. Also just to add, during this late  2016/2017 period I was trying to get my own weight up, so was trying  really hard in getting in more calories than my usual intake, so this  didn't help too as you could imagine, trying to force more food in while  feeling nauseous frequently from the anxiety. Fast forward to now, with the anxiety that was caused by the uncertainty  no longer lingering around, I am feeling much better as a person. Never  felt nauseous in a long long time, feeling more motivated as a person.  But 1 problem still persists, I still lose my appetite eating in public,  or rather eating around strangers/friends. This has led me to hang out  with friends very infrequently because I was afraid that when we are  going to have a meal I'm gonna feel all nauseous. This is a hurdle I  desperately need and want to get past as I want to lead a normal life  again, being able to hang out with friends, have fun, have meals with  them happily and with no worries at all, or literally even just have a  meal in a school canteen without any appetite loss or nauseousness. To  put it in another way, I actually think that right now I have no issues  eating in public but then the thought of me feeling nauseous/losing  appetite while eating in the past has caused me to fear that it would  happen everytime I eat in public, therefore the feeling comes back  again. If you get what I mean? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre there anyone out there who experienced something similar or know of  someone who has? Would appreciate if anyone can advice some sort of ways  to help me fully overcome this issue. Would also much prefer not going  to see a psychologists as I have tried it once and it didn't change  anything for me.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

I know that's ridiculous. If anywhere I would carry more weight in my stomach. I've checked repeatedly though and nothing has actually changed. At least not to an extent I could notice.

Single parent, two jobs, skirting the poverty line, lots of fast food. Some bad shit happened and I started emotional eating, turned into binge eating, nearly got to 300lbs. Went off to college, started developing healthier habits, wasn't under the stress I was living at home so the weight started coming off. Got addicted to the positive comments about my weight loss. So I started losing weight intentionally and spiraled out of control to restrictive behaviours and food aversion and the whole shebang. 100+ lbs down to a good, healthy weight, where I am now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not even sure I want to lose more weight. I'm at a high \"normal\" BMI but I lift weights and have a large frame and I'm curious how much of my weight is just loose skin at this point, and I'm tall so I know objectively I probably look fine, now. I'm trying to do better. I'd been doing better. I haven't weighed myself in two weeks. Trying not to count calories. Making sure I ate enough. I've been doing OMAD religiously because my binge urges strike when I start snacking and my restriction urges strike when I feel that I can \"skip meals\" so instead I have one unskippable meal a day and I eat until I'm full, and that takes my mind off food for 23 hours. It was working wonders. If I had to guess I was averaging about 1300/cals a day and I was feeling really good. I wasn't feeling guilty about anything.  And I feels like I lost all of that yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom asked if I wanted to go shopping. I love shopping with my mom, we never got to do this when I was a teenager because I cried in every dressing room and we could only afford it right before school and at the thrift stores we went to I bought the same mens hoodies and flannels year after year. I went three years in HS wearing literally the same three black hoodies and sweat pants. So now that I'm financially independent and my mom's working a good honest salary job I love going shopping. I can fit into smalls and mediums! WOMENS smalls and mediums. From wearing mens XLs. We shop &amp; get Red Robin (my fave fucking restaurant I haven't let myself eat in months) and I get my usual + split an extra basket of fries with my mom. And no guilt! Cute clothes + family time I missed out on as a teen + no food guilt! I'm on a roll!!  I got into baking when I was in high school and got really good at making bread. My mom asked if I'd help her bake some loaves for a potluck she was having at work. No problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe get back to her house. It's a shitty duplex with no central A/C and the appliances only work half the time but it's nicer than some of the places we crashed when I was a kid. The only place besides my own apartment that feels like home. My brother just graduated college and is living with her right now as he's job hunting. My brother is... difficult to say the least, and he has his own food struggles. Played college football so they would have to gorge or starve to meet their weight targets, and he's lost more weight (too fast) than I have and he's strictly keto and makes sure to comment on EVERYTHING my mom or I eats in front of him. She had excitedly bought some milk and ice cream from the local dairy she wanted me to try. We made some tea and ate some ice cream and my brother had to give us a lecture on how dirty the milk probably was and how much sugar was in the ice cream and my mom started getting upset but didn't let on. Whatever. I clear the table to make bread and wash the surface good and flour it for kneading and my brother stands over me the whole time and moans about the mess I'm making (as if he does any share of the cleaning). Whatever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI let the bread rise, drink some more tea, and my brother leaves us alone.   I go to use the bathroom and when I stand up my mom asks if I've lost more weight. I honestly don't know if I have, I'm trying not to weigh myself right now. I don't know why but the comment makes me feel queasy. My mom doesn't know about my disordered eating, she just thinks I just decided to have a \\*\\~weight loss journey\\~\\* and thinks since I'm vegetarian and active I'm the picture of health. She keeps telling me I've lost too much weight but honestly my brother and I are the only people in our extended families that aren't very overweight or obese so her vision is a little skewed I think. By the numbers I'm perfectly fine, it's just been a big change for her to see.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we go to put the loaves in her oven isn't working. The whole house smells like gas and it's a million degrees in the kitchen. She doesn't have a knife sharp enough to slice the tops pretty and the loaves end up falling. I'm getting stressed because I'm sweating, and I've eaten too much, and the kitchen is a mess, and my brother is circling and squawking like a vulture, and the oven's not working, and it's getting dark outside, and my mom's talked me up to her coworkers as a master baker, and now we don't know if we'll even be able to make bread. Her oven kicks on in the last minute and it doesn't stay a stable temperature but for all intents and purposes it works. Four ugly, slightly dense baguettes, but we slice up some and it tastes really good. My mom makes some garlic butter and I end up eating 1/3 loaf from stress alone, and clean up the kitchen. My mom wraps me up half a loaf to take home and I try show her a youtube video but her TV keep short circuting and cutting off and my brother keeps loudly saying it's cringey and my mom can't hear it and it's so overwhelming I just cut it off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was excited to give the bread to my roommates because that's usually what I do when I bake something (so I don't eat all of it by myself), and I love sharing, but when I get there no one's home. So I grab a slice because it's really that good. And then another slice. And then I just tear the rest of it apart and eat it super fast. And then I get back into my car and go to the gas station and grab a Coke zero and a pint of ice cream. I leave my wallet on the counter and don't realize till I get home. Go all the way back immediately, get it from the clerk, I'm crying, get home, inhale the half-melted ice cream. I'm sobbing because my stomach hurts because I just crammed too much in there too fast. I try to purge, get disgusted w myself for trying to purge since I've only ever purged twice and go to lie down and cry in my room.  I'm so anxious bc I don't have access to a gym for all of July, and I totaled up my calories for the day and it was just about 4500 (yikes!!!!!!) and I'm super bloated and I'm probably going to fast for the next few days but I shouldn't care! It was just one \"bad\" eating day out if probably 20 or so!! I've probably lost weight in the two weeks I haven't been weighing myself or counting calories! But my body looks gross, and I'm all loose skin, and I wish I was underweight, and I know recovery isn't linear but it feels like I've slid all the way back to rock bottom and I learned I miss people saying that I look like I've lost weight again and I just.

He was in and out of hospitals a ton.\n\nUltimately, in high school, we had a huge falling out because his eating disorder was triggering my generalized anxiety, depression, and death anxiety.\n\nBut more recently (in the last 2 years) we have begun hanging out again.\n\nI've missed him a ton. Getting him back in my life was a huge gift.\n\nBut I've hung out with him dozens of times now since moving back to the area where we both used to live. . . And it's been nearly 2 years and I've never seen him eat anything. Ever.\n\nI've seen him consume water. And I've seen him consume zero sugar variety of Coke. (I never did care for sodas due to how unhealthy they seem, and his exclusive consumption of it has made me almost vomit when smelling it, recently, simply because of how much I loathe the existence of soft drinks.)\n\nHe has more than one Therapist, but I have no idea how much he talks about this problem. . . If he talks about it at all with them.\n\nSo much of the resources out there are aimed at teens and women. He is in his mid twenties now and is trans, but identifies as male. So these resources really alienate me a bit. Nothing feels built to help this situation.\n\nI am terrified that doing nothing will lose me my best friend to deterioration of physical health. I am terrified that doing something will lose me any time I might have if I just keep my mouth shut.\n\nI don't want to lose my best friend. And I feel like both options end up with the same result, albeit in differing ways and timelines.\n\nWhen I first started seeing him again. . . I was able to brush my feelings aside. But lately we've been looking forward to certain games together and his poor health has been triggering my death anxiety and causing me to have issues again, just like when we were teens.\n\nI don't know what to do.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

I've had a bad relationship with food for a while now but it really developed into actual disordered behaviors a little over a year ago. I've always been overweight (was obese even, in elementary school, which the gym teachers so sweetly pointed out in a slip they had us bring home to our parents. Thanks!) I still am overweight according to my BMI and I believe it, though I also know that I have quite a bit of muscle, so I'm not sure how that factors into everything. Definitely doesn't help my brain feel any better lmao! What is logic? I have never heard of her.\n\nAnyways, while I started to restrict and overexercise last summer, it was starting college that really propelled me into it. It was a perfect situation. I was unsupervised, busy, could nap instead of eating, say I was \"too busy studying\", and always walking to class etc. I noticeably lost weight, which seemed to pleasantly surprise my family.\n\nThen come Spring semester, I felt like I had no control over myself and was just bingeing constantly. I have a meal plan while at school, 2 meals a day, but I would get the most high cal options and my school serves you the portions and they're MASSIVE, not just to eating disordered eyes but to anyone. They're just ridiculously large and I guess I was raised not to waste food so even though they're enormous and nobody should be expected to finish them, I always eat as much of them as I can because I guess I feel bad about just..throwing food in the trash, especially because my mom is paying for it. Like my brain just cannot even comprehend that I can...throw food away, even when I'm absolutely miserable while I'm eating it and feel sick. To me, this was not imagined at all, and I was genuinely overreating every day and gaining tons of weight. I still believe I literally was. I didn't count calories every day, but when I did, it was often in about the 2,200-2,300 range!\n\nMy family's scale broke, so I haven't been able to weigh myself and I've been going based on vision and pictures alone which...is a horrible idea when you have BDD, so I never know what I look like. But people have continuously commented on my weight loss. I didn't understand this. I thought to myself \"What are they talking about? I've gained it all back and then some?\" I thought they were referring to the weight loss from my first semester still, and I always found it just incredibly strange that they would mention it when I've gotten so much bigger since then. \n\nI even had my brother's grandma see me after a while and say \"You've lost a ton of weight!\" (In front of a whole room full of people I didn't know) And even go as far as to say out loud \"Hey, you're not one of those anorexics, are you?\" Which was obviously a deeply uncomfortable moment for me lol. My mom and I talked about it when we got home later (She isn't aware I have any issues. I am hesitant to call it an eating disorder because I just feel so much like I'm faking it or not suffering as much or not small enough or something and I'm definitely not losing any weight at the moment...well to my knowledge. She just won't get a new scale dammit! lmfao) and she basically said that she was frustrated that she said that to me because she's \"already explained it to her! I told her what I tell everybody, that it was through making better food choices and walking on campus,\" Which made me think like...Wait, everybody? How many people have been asking you about this? At the time I'm still convinced I'm at a higher weight than before I even started.\n\nThen I went to my sister's house. Her gf commented as soon as I came in that I was \"so tiny!\" and \"you can really see it in your face!\" I stayed the night in the guest room and it turns out she has a scale in there, and it's possible it's broken, but I didn't want to ask and draw attention to myself. I get on it anyways and it says I'm at the lowest weight I've been at since like 7th grade. I'm extremely confused. To see if it's busted I wait until the next morning after a BM when I haven't eaten a ton of food and had a ton of liquid and I'm just in Prime Weighing Condition, and it says a weight that's 3 lbs lighter, which after consuming all that food and liquid the day before etc I thought was a pretty reasonable difference? It wasn't a digital one, if that means anything. Those good old triggering ones that physically move the numbers with the weight of you stepping on it. \n\nSo it still might be broken, and I'm inclined to believe it is, but at the same time it would explain why people have continuously commented on my weight loss. Maybe I haven't gained it all back and that was just in my imagination. But I'm also deeply confused if that's the case because I don't understand how I couldn't have gained all that weight back while bingeing at school? Is that my imagination too? It's just so confusing. Either way, (TW NUMBERS) if that scale is correct, I've lost about 22-24 lbs in a year. I don't know if I have a point to this. I just feel very confused and don't know what to believe even now. \n\nTLDR: I don't know how much I weigh because my scale is broken. I thought I gained a ton of weight from bingeing but people kept commenting on my weight loss, and then I weighed myself on a potentially broken scale and it said I had reached a new LW but I don't understand how that could be possible. Just confused in general and venting.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I also somehow got a UTI this week which meant that not only was I running to the bathroom EVERY FIVE SECONDS to pee, my antibiotics now made my anus a literal portal to hell.

I look way bigger, the number is just fueling my disordered behavior to the max because for some godforsaken reason I have to have very specific numbers. It's a weird form of perfectionism that's just weird enough to be \"unusual\" and not \"a disorder\".

I've been shunned and laughed it in support groups in the past for bringing it up. But here's a link if you want more info.\n\nhttps://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/diabulimia-5\n\nAnyways, in a nut shell... diabulimia is an ED that specifically effects people with type one diabetes. We skip taking insulin, and cause our blood sugar to become so high that our bodies literally begin eating its self. The weight loss is extremely rapid. It's miserable, and extremely life threatening. It causes massive amounts of damage in every way possible. \n\nSo I was diagnosed with type one diabetes when I was 12. At the time, I was about 5'6 and weighed 90 lbs. No one knew I was sick but everyone seemed so proud that I had lost so much weight (I was a fat kid growing up and got bullied.) despite being underweight and frail. I was super sick and thin. After rehabilitation, I shot up to 130. \n\nAround age 14, I started getting really chunky and began getting bullied again. It hurt to go back to that. That's when it hit me, that I could lose the weight the same way I lost it before. So I started restricting insulin. Then insulin restriction turned into food restriction. Food restriction turned into binging and purging. I was excessively exercising. Before we knew it, i was 5'10 and weighed 90 lbs. \n\nA year or two passed and I was admitted to an inpatient hospital for a few months. I got to a healthy weight and recovered...for a while. \n\nI entered my first serious relationship, got on birth control, got my diabetes under tight control and gained tons of weight. I ended up obese. 250 lbs. A few years pass and we split. Then I ended up in another relationship. An extremely abusive one. I relapsed and fell back down to 140. I ended up pregnant, and didn't know it. By the time I found out it was too late and I lost the baby. I blamed my self and vowed to become healthy again. \n\nSince then I have been struggling with my weight. It fluctuates a lot, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't give in to old behaviors. Lately it's been pretty bad. I'm trying to take care of my diabetes while eating healthy and trying to be healthy as possible but everytime I eat, I still get terrible anxiety about taking insulin. The thoughts never go away. So I guess I'm really posting this to see if anyone else here had had to live with diabulimia. \n\nI've been on so many life threatening situations because of this shit. So many times in the ICU. Everytime life gets hard, I feel like I need control. Everytime i am ashamed of anything at all, I direct my focus to my weight. It could be because of work or my relationship, but I will make the real problem my weight. \n\nI'm sorry I made this so long. I needed to rant and get some stuff of my chest.

I was really eager to just go \"all in\", improve my metabolism and get my period back, knowing full well that I would gain weight and feel bloated for a while. I promised myself not to exercise heavily for at least two weeks and just let my body heal. The bloating has been pretty intense (I've looked three-months pregnant for the past week) but I've just been constantly reminding myself that I want to become healthy again.

Senior year of high school I decided I\u2019m gonna change my lifestyle and eat healthier. I ate a lot of really great nutrient dense food, and ended up losing weight because of it. Keep in mind I was an athlete and committed to go to college for a sport. All was great until I realized I was eating a lot of carbs and \u201ccarbs were bad\u201d. I spiraled. No carbs, no sugar, etc. at my lowest I was 119. Starting point probably 165, all in maybe 6 months. I became obsessive that summer and into my freshman year of college. My teammates were worried. I would eat an apple for breakfast, deli turkey for lunch, and veggies for dinner. I was oblivious because my performance was not being hurt. Lots happened that year but I ended up turning all those issues into binge eating. \n\nI struggled and still do with binge eating, but now I\u2019m back to 165lbs. My body composition is much more muscular and toned than 4 years ago since I\u2019ve transitioned from college athletics to strictly lifting. \n\nMy diet has never been the same since my senior year of high school. I KNOW how to eat properly to fuel my body and that I need to eat 2,000+ calories a day, but my brain never LET me. I would always sit around 1,300-1,500cal. It doesn\u2019t help that my mother is half my size and doesn\u2019t eat carbs- she\u2019s the root of all this anyways. \n\nStarting this week I am literally forcing myself to actually eat snacks (something I didn\u2019t do in 4 years), actually eat lunch WITH CARBS!, and bigger dinners. I firmly believe this will control my hunger and essentially curb my feelings to binge. I\u2019m so ready to just release all this body negativity I have and food stigma with carbs and be able to eat freely and nutritiously. I\u2019m on day one and it\u2019s been hard. I had an apple as a snack before lunch and my brain just kept telling me \u201cI don\u2019t need this\u201d. I had quinoa and chicken for lunch, my brain kept telling me \u201cthis will make you fat, you never have carbs for lunch.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m trying to fight these thoughts because deep down I know they\u2019re all wrong and eating like this will help me so much more mentally and physically. It\u2019s been 4 years binging and I could never escape from it but this post is starting my mind, body, and soul reformation.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

(TW)", "author": "XxLittleMissMaddie", "self_text": "I've been struggling with an eating disorder since I was 16. I'm 22 now. I assumed I was just going to extreme diet until I got skinny and then I would stop. Well fast forward and my eating disorder is more present than ever. \n\nWhen I was 11, I started to think I was fat. My mother would always say \"You're more broad and your sisters are more narrow.\" Ever since that day, I've always looked at my shoulders and thought they were too big. Although my mom said this, looking back at photos I've always been smaller than my sisters. Although that comment stuck with me, it didn't cause me to diet or anything. It just made me look at myself differently. The ED all started when the guy I lost my virginity to told me that I could lose some weight right after we were intimate. I was an extremely muscular girl, but everyone loved my body. I had a really big butt from working out and I was just super fit. I used to be so confident before that. Once he realized it hurt me, him and his friends began to bully me about my weight. If I wore crop tops, his friends would say \"Are you pregnant? You look pregnant.\" And they would always joke around and call me fat. At this point, I started to restrict. I was destined to lose weight. Around this time, I believe I was probably 110/115 pounds. I found the pro ana community on Tumblr and my obsession with thinspos started. I found tips and tricks on how to lose weight. I started drinking a lot of coffee and tea and eating a lot less food. Someone in class looked at my food journal and put me on blast about the fact that eating 300 cal per day is horrible. My coach yelled at me for posting a thinspo on twitter and saying #bodygoals. Eventually, I dropped out of my sport. This helped me lose all the muscle I had fast. My restricting eventually caused me to get into the 90's range. No matter how much weight I lost, I still looked in the mirror and saw someone huge staring back at me. Once I moved away from home, I lost more weight. My first two years of college, I mainly hardcore restricted, but once my junior year of college came around I begin to binge/purge. My family eventually realized I had an eating disorder due to weight loss and huge dental bills. Now that everything is in the open, my family wants me to get help, but I feel like I'm too fat to get help. At the moment, I weigh 104 lbs because I've been binge eating like freakin crazy. My doctor said \"I don't raise any red flags, but she's referring me to a mental health provider just so I don't slip through the cracks\" and I think she says that because Im not skinny enough. Which only motivates me more to lose weight. My mom wants me to attend an inpatient program, but Im too fat for that too. Overall, it sucks to be 22 years old with an eating disorder and feeling like Im too fat to get help. I'll never ever be skinny enough.

Since university though my eating is absolutely terrible. During the day I am fine and I can easily eat normal, healthy meals. When I am out eating with people I am fine, for example yesterday I was out for a meal and it was a really nice meal but I was full so only ate half, then I had a chocolate dessert (chocolate is what my binges consist of 99% of the time) and, again, I only ate half because I was full so I only ate until I was satisfied which felt easy and natural. Now, if I had eaten that exact meal at home (on my own, in front of Netflix) I would have eaten the whole thing and I would have started feeling sick. I would have known I was full and didn't want anymore but I would have eaten every last bite.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLiterally every evening I binge eat. I get anxious if I don't have my stash of junk food. I literally get butterflies during the day when I'm out and I remember I have stuff stashed in my room I can binge on when I get home. I have tried every tactic going - calorie counting, intermittent fasting, eating mindfully, trying to eat so much chocolate that I am permanently put off it (will never happen), brushing my teeth early in the evening, going out for a walk instead, etc. The thing is I am so unmotivated to do it, there is a part of me that wants to lose weight and be more healthy but it is very weak compared to the part of me that knows food is my therapy and my comfort. I thought a lot of it was boredom or depression as at university my life was quite solitary (sitting in my room writing essays). But now I am busy working most days spending lots of time around people and am a lot happier I still binge eat to almost calm myself down? So even if I have a good day the binge is to calm me down/soothe myself?

I was utterly confused because neither of my parents work in Boston and there is never a reason to go there other than the amazing health care. \n\nI got home and was greeted by grandmother who tried to give me some excuse about my sister breaking her leg and that\u2019s why she went to the ER. So I went. \n\nThe ER was oddly quiet as my mother sat there on the hospital bed next to my sister, who was 12 years old at the time, looking completely defeated. My sister, who we will call \u201cS\u201d for the sake of simplicity, was hidden under the baggy layers of her dark, oversized clothing. \n\nThe nurse offered a sympathetic smile as she walked in.\n\n\u201cHello S\u201d the Nurse spoke, \u201cwe are going to bring in the doctor soon to check you out okay?\u201d \n\nI was really confused because my sisters physical condition was fine, or so I thought. I soon found out that she tried to kill herself and performed self harm. I was indifferent. Which was weird. I never had a reaction it\u2019s almost as if I was in shock but not shocked. I had no train of thought for the first time in my life. \n\nThis is where we got lucky.\n\nS immediately got into one of the treatment centers for suicide prevention at Boston children\u2019s hospital which is a miracle because there is a very small amount of rooms available in the facility and a lot of people need them. \n\nEach day I would come home from school, go into Boston during the visiting hours and then drive back home which got me home at about 10-11 each night. It was terrible seeing S like that, so deranged and confused, struggling to find herself in a sea of self-hatred. \n\nShe tried to kill herself multiple times in the facility and even attempted to run into traffic (which she learned from her roommate) when we were allowed to take her out of the facility and explore Boston with her.\n\nFinally the day came, where she was released from residential treatment (meaning she lived at the facility) into day treatment. This means that she would do treatment like school everyday and would get to come home at night and sleep there. \n\nThis is where she found out eating disorders existed. She stopped the suicide after about a year and then started to embrace the eating disorders. This meant that she could no longer receive treatment from the facility that we were in with her because they strictly dealt with suicide. \n\nWe went to another treatment facility and checked her in for anorexia and bulimia (which she learned from online). This place fucked up massively. They gave S the binder of poets that were for my mother and gave my mother the binder of poets that were for S. So S learned where the medicine was stored, what the meal plans were, and most importantly how to get kicked out. \n\nYou can get kicked out of that specific place through hurting yourself and doing self harm. (Most self harm/suicide places refuse to deal with eating disorders and eating disorder places refuse to deal with suicide). \n\nSo my parents went to see her the next night where she proceeded to throw herself on the ground and throw fits claiming that the facility was abusing her and referring to my mother as, \u201cmommy! Mommy!\u201d While screaming to, \u201cget me out!!!!\u201d In a very toddler tone. \n\nI went to see her the next night. \n\nThis night she tried to break her own finger and then bashed her own head into a dresser. This was our breaking point and we pulled her out of the facility because they were not feeding her. \n\nWe then tried another facility, and another, and another, all the while she was missing school and getting terrible grades. My family is at a point now where the insurance company is trying to get her into the next best facility because she had not made any progress over the past two years. (This is because she refuses and does not want to change). This facility is 23 hours away.. and my family is breaking apart. \n\nI can\u2019t even explain the hardships that my parents face and the abuse that they put up with on a daily basis. The family of a person with an eating disorder is affected more than you would think, and to see S continue this way for so long is awful to put it lightly. \n\nI want to hear from other siblings, I want to know what has worked for you and your sibling and what hasn\u2019t. We have tried everything and S is one of the worst cases in America. I know that she will not change until she wants to change, but how does one make that happen?

It's weird but I swear I look thinner with a thick sweater draping off of me than I do looking at my bare arm. Maybe's it's all the loose fabric hanging down that shows just how much room I'm not taking up in the sleeves. I don't really know. I feel like my arms look almost average to me except when I wear a sweater. Then they look super thin. I noticed the same thing with my legs just now. I'm sitting with my feet up and a blanket covering my legs. I have been especially dysmorphic about my legs since gaining weight. I really can't tell how much of that weight went to my thighs and my calves. I feel like they're huge now, but I also know that's probably not true. Well, my blanket was loosely draped over my legs and I had my knees up a bit so it loosely formed around my shins. I decided to tuck the blanket in so it wouldn't be loose and I noticed that my legs absolutely do still look thin like they did when I was underweight. Maybe slightly bigger, but not by much. Now that I think about it, I even have the same phenomenon occur with my waist. If I wear a form-fitted shirt or I pull on my shirt so it's tight I look a lot thinner than I do if I wear a crop top or have no shirt on. Does anyone else notice this happens to them as well?

It\u2019s gotten to the point where I refuse to eat anything that I haven\u2019t tracked as part of a meal because I knew if I start eating I just won\u2019t stop. It\u2019s just goes into the endless pit.\n\nBUT.\n\nI\u2019ve found a trick and it\u2019s been working incredibly for me.\n\nI need to preface this that saying that THIS MAY NOT WORK FOR EVERYONE and it may in fact be triggering depending on the nature of your condition so proceed with caution.\n\nI\u2019ve found that watching people binge eat on the Internet, specifically youtubers like Anonymous Brahette, helps me control my binge.\n\nWhen we binge, we really don\u2019t taste what we\u2019re eating. It\u2019s more the satisfaction of all that junk and shoving it in to our mouths for a moment before moving on to more and more. \n\nWith these, it\u2019s almost pornographic getting to watch someone eating the stuff I know I can eat and in the quantity I want to\u2014 it\u2019s vicarious eating. \n\nBut on top of that, I noticed I\u2019d start to comment in my head like \n\u201comg yes dig into another bite of that,\u201d \n\u201cJesus that looks amazing\u201d but also I started to think \n\u201chuh, I would have spent more calories on this instead of that,\u201d \n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t eat that for my binge I\u2019d eat this instead.\u201d\n\nWatching her, I would just imagine how each thing tasted, and in doing so, I felt like I was getting some satisfaction out of it. Plus, for BED they often tell you to try to slow down and focus on the taste of what you\u2019re eating so you appreciate it and don\u2019t feel as desperate for it.\n\nAnd guys, it\u2019s working for me. I snacked yesterday. I felt in control because I felt like, watching her, I\u2019d already had my guilty binge and o felt satiated, I just wanted a bit of oatmeal and I was able to CONTROL how much I wanted!\n\nI hope this helps\n\nI don\u2019t know", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I\u2019m very nervous for this appointment. I haven\u2019t seen my doctor since I had been overweight and I am now bordering underweight for my height. I\u2019m painfully aware that I\u2019ll have to share my ED struggles with my doctor as I\u2019m significantly lighter.\n\nI guess my questions are, for those of you recovering from an ED and are on birth control, how is it? Is this safe for me? Will I even be allowed to do this? (I\u2019m also very scared of birth control making me gain weight).\n\nMy other pressing question is, how do I tell my doctor about these things without feeling so humiliated? I\u2019m highly embarrassed by my condition. I know I should be going to therapy as I\u2019m still very much struggling, yet I\u2019m scared my doctor will tell me I\u2019m not suffering from an ED because I\u2019ve been doing decently on my own. I know I could easily spiral again. How do you get past these fears? Thank you.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

But now it's to late. \nMy healthy brain tells me to stop right now, before it gets even worse, my disorder tells me to keep going because I don't want to look feminine (I struggle with gender identity so my female sex characteristic are a huge triggering factor for me and probably even the initial reason for this stupid disorder). \nI hate my curves, I hate that people perceive me as female, but I don't want to transition. I have decided against it so I'm looking for other ways to cope, I'm not binding my chest anymore instead my brain is telling me to lose enough weight to not have a feminine chest anymore. I know that is stupid. I know it's not going to work. I hate myself for even thinking that, but I just can't eat. I feel so guilt for today, before I'm going to sleep (it's 11:50 pm here) I'm probably instinctively going to do sit ups. Or jumping jacks. \n\nHow the hell to I get out of this. I'm so desperate. I feel so lost. What alternative is there. I really really just want to fall asleep and never wake up again.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Looking forward to getting dressed tomorrow, Jesus, anyways here you go:\n\nI have been a bulimic, a dieter, a runner, binge eater, or some fun combo since I was about 16. Now I'm 22 and still letting this garbage control my life. A couple of months I gave up obsessively running to try and stay fit to instead track calories and hallelujah it worked, reached the weight I had dreamt about for years, I started losing weight quickly, 2-3 lbs each week. Probably would have been faster but like every 5-6 days I'd binge eat a little, fast it off or lower my calories the next day like nothing happened, worked like a charm. Boom, down 20 lbs. But tired and anxious and stressed and fearful of gaining weight. And it wasn't enough, why couldn't I lose maybe 10 more? Then I'd reach happiness for sure. Binging came a little more often. And I ate a little more each time. I started binging at social events that should of been fun but instead I was just focused on how much food I could stuff in my face and how much I hated myself. Fasting got harder. Weight started coming back...before I know I can't track calories for more than like 3 days and weight keeps on coming on.\n\nSo this is probably the same old same old for lots of people in this sub, very familiar story. I realized that fuck, yep I have an eating disorder, I've always had one (I guess I never really ditched bulimia like I thought I did) andI need help. So 3 weeks ago I started I looking into intuitive eating and online therapy and podcasts for binge eating and they are say the same thing: stop restricting yourself, stop calorie counting and just \"feel for your hunger\" and you won't want to binge. Welp I ditched MyFitnessPal, threw away the scale, and it just feels like instead of being anxious about limiting my food I'm anxious about the weight that I am definitely gaining and anxious about not being able to judge when to stop eating or \"oh shit if I don't eat this am I restricting\". And guess motherfuckin what, I just binged again. Hard. And I was not restricting my food, I wasn't calorie counting, I was just goddamn tired of trying so hard to \"listen to my body\". And I like the idea of accepting myself as I am and but that would be cool...if my body was stable. I physically feel myself getting chubbier, clothes are not fitting as well, I'm getting more and more uncomfortable in my body, and this healthy relationship with food I keep hearing about is nowhere in sight. I've looked up body indifference and I don't want the solution to be to just not care how I look, I don't think I can do that nor is it reasonable to just stop caring. I feel like I've lost complete control and even though I was miserable dieting at least the one thing I had was that I had the high of occasionally feeling thin and hot. Now I just have the same anxiety, and still can't stop binging and I really just want to start counting again so I know what the hell doing to my body at least because it's about as reliable as Amazon customer service. \n\nSo in summary, what the fuck guys. Any advice on what am I supposed to do cause online therapy telling me to practice mindfulness and \"live in the now\" is not helping super a lot.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I don't know how to stop bingeing.", "author": "SenMahogany", "self_text": "I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and I believe I have autism but I don't have an official diagnosis. I have typed this so many times on so many different forums it's not even funny but I have always, always struggled with making friends. Since my earliest memory. I've always been socially awkward and have had trouble with eye contact and saying the right things and overthinking and so on. I also suffer from panic attacks. Throughout my life I have been bullied but especially in high school and at certain jobs post high school. I have also never been able to befriend a co worker. No matter how hard I try people either ignore me or treat me like crap. I have never been able to find my \"tribe.\" So I don't have any friends; just a few acquaintances. I've also suffered from physical. emotional, and sexual abuse. My parents were physically and emotionally abusive. I'm not comfortable going into the details of my sexual abuse except it was never dealt with. I told a family member and my family is still close with this person. So food has always been there for me. When I was sad, lonely, depressed, anxious etc. food was always there. I didn't have a sweet 16 or go to prom or anything but I did celebrate by buying myself snacks. When I would come home from school and all the shittiness I had to deal with I would snack. The bullying, the sadness I would snack to make myself feel better. To deal with the abuse; snack. Dealing with racism or just having a shitty day; snack. Having to drop out of college and be a failure; snack. Now I binge constantly. I will gorge myself on boxes of brownies, cookies, chips, in one day. I'm overweight for the first time in my life and now I feel even more like crap so I binge more to make myself feel better and it's a vicious cycle. I am disgusted by my body even more. I don't know how to break it. I don't have anyone to talk to besides my therapist and I only see them once a month and well reddit posts. I don't have a support system. I am considered a burden to my family. Food or better yet snacks pumped full of sugar have been the only constant thing there for me in my life. If anyone can relate and/or has any advice it would be very appreciated.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I refused to eat anything for week and obviously my parents noticed, so they sent me to a therapist. She told me at one point if it stayed like this I wouldn\u2019t be able to go to college this year because it wouldn\u2019t be safe or healthy for me, which was true. I\u2019ve had ups and downs since then but for most of the spring I didn\u2019t throw up or restrict at all. In the back of my mind, though, whenever I wanna use ED behaviors I\u2019ve just reminded myself I can when I\u2019m in college and there\u2019s nobody to stop me. \n\nIn early June, I started making myself throw up again, not a ton at first, but its gotten worse and more common. Same with restricting. A few nights ago I got drunk and had a breakdown, telling my parents I knew I would start restricting again if I went to college, and how I felt like I needed to go to a local residential program, which I have nearly been sent to a couple of times before. They were mad but mostly just worried so they contacted the program and I've sent in my paperwork (this is more like an application, though, just sending in the paperwork isn't a commitment to going). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday though, I feel like maybe I should just go to college and try to do a day program for the remainder of the summer instead of residential, or just do my normal weekly therapy. Because, if I do the residential program it will seep over into my college year starting enough that I won't be able to attend this semester. I'm a complete perfectionist especially when it comes to school. I've worked hard throughout high school so that I could get into a good college, which I did. I don't wanna have to miss a semester because I base all my self worth off of my academic performance and I'm very driven and getting a good education and being successful after that is very, very important to me, its by far my top priority, above my health. I know that that isn't a good thing but its still true. If I don't go to college and fall a year behind and graduate later than everyone in my high school class I'll feel like a complete failure, plus even though I have a job I'll feel like a lazy idiot when everyone else starts school this fall if I don't go to school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents, boyfriend, and all my close friends are very worried about my mental health when I go to college, and think that I should take a gap year to get my mental health in check, especially because the thought of starting college has been a big trigger for my eating disorder (for example I stopped eating for a week straight after I submitted college applications, and I started using behaviors again in June right after high school graduation). But, ultimately my parents have said they'll let me do whatever I think is best, because I know more about how I'm feeling and how my eating disorder works than they do. I know that they and everyone else around me will continue to be very supportive regardless of what option I choose, thats not a problem,  I just don't know what to do. I genuinely don't know what level of care I need or what I'll be able to handle at college. If anybody has any advice or similar experiences please let me know.

I'm so thankful for this resource and for those who come to share their experience as a way to help others navigate the thorniness of EDs.\n\nI\u2019m here today to ask what others have done when they change something about their lifestyle that affects how well they can or can\u2019t restrict. For context, I\u2019m a 25m with about \\~10 years of restriction/binge type disorder under my belt, generally fluctuating near the lower end of \u201cnormal\u201d BMI but now at the cusp of underweight. \n\nRecently I stopped smoking weed habitually. I had been smoking every day; now I might indulge if someone offers it to me, but I\u2019m not smoking at home. When I was smoking a lot, I would usually restrict heavily through the day and then end up getting high at night and bingeing (not *really*, but eating enough to compensate for the calories I\u2019d restricted earlier in the day). Now that I\u2019m not smoking so much, I\u2019m so much better at not eating. \n\nIdeally I\u2019d have a healthy relationship with food and be able to enforce some kind of regular diet on myself. That\u2019s clearly not going to happen in the short term. So I\u2019m curious what kind of things people have done to themselves to induce that kind of ravenousness that one associates with weed\u2014or at least strategies to try to be getting calories in themselves over the course of the day so that that nighttime binge isn\u2019t as necessary. \n\nI think that my natural hunger response is dormant, and I find it really hard to pressure myself to eat when I\u2019m not hungry. So as much as I\u2019d love to just be mindfully snacking through the day, I\u2019d really rather be eating out of hunger rather than a need for sustenance. \n\nAnywayyy, thoughts? x", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I was diagnosed at age 15 and I'm 26 now. I've been in therapy almost the entire time because my parents live close to me and I'm also just close to my family in general. I also have been inpatient twice, though I wasn't fully committed to it either time (partially because I'm still very adamant that the goal weight they set for me is way too high and partially because I was somewhat coerced into it by my parents).  Anyway, I'm finally seeing a therapist that I really like and trust that was trained through the program at the hospital where I was inpatient and she knows my psychiatrist I see at the hospital very well. She's very understanding and is much more willing to meet me where I am, whereas some of the therapists I have seen in the past  have been very punitive and berated me if I lost any weight at all when I saw them or admitted that I had acted on my eating disorder. My current therapist is much more holistic. She and I agreed upon a contract because I have been seeing her since January and my weight has not increased (It did go up a little, but I lost it all when she was away for two weeks on her honeymoon.) She recommended a higher level of care about two months ago, but I refused. Thus the contract. She did agree to see me twice a week, though, in lieu of going inpatient.  In the contract, I have to gain a certain amount of weight in four weeks (though that number is not set in stone and she says if she legitimately sees me trying, (i.e. increase my intake and decrease exercise, she would not stop seeing me solely based on my weight.), vary my food choices, exercise only four times a week for 30 minutes (I was exercising A LOT more than that previously, so even going down to that is tough), and deal with my emotions and thoughts by using coping skills. If I can't manage to do those things, she said that she will recommend a higher level of care and she cannot see me on an outpatient basis anymore.  I really like her and for some reason I have been a bit more motivated since I have been working with her, so I really don't want to stop seeing her (especially because she is like the 7th therapist I have seen so far and by far my favorite). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I don't know if I have a clear question. **How does everyone deal with moderating exercise during recovery?** I am so freaked out that I'm going to gain so much weight even if I take a day off of exercise, so having to take three days off during a week is so hard to conceive of, especially because I'm also eating a lot more than I was when I was restricting. The crazy thing is I have been eating a lot more for about two weeks and exercising at least a little bit less and I haven't gained a pound yet. Yet I still fear that this trend won't continue and I will start rapidly gaining weight. **Also, how do you reconcile gaining weight when you are not that underweight?** I have about 9-10 pounds to gain before I am not considered underweight anymore, but that seems so insignificant compared to how little I weighed at my lowest weight when I was first diagnosed. **Finally, how do you deal with increasing your intake while living alone?** It's so easy to lie and say I ate something/didn't exercise, but I know that is only going to strengthen my eating disorder and I will never gain weight if I do that.  This is the first time I've really been in recovery and actually put forth some effort without my parents having a say in what I eat (as was the case basically through college). So basically I'm looking for any **recovery tips or things that made recovery easier for someone that initially went through treatment with a lot of supervision from family, but eventually you lived on your own and had to choose it for yourself.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR I have had my eating disorder for 11 years (diagnosed at age 15, now I'm 26). I'm finally trying to commit to recovery and I love my therapist. What are some recovery tips that made it easier for someone that initially had a lot of family support (making meals, having supervision) but now has to decide what choices to make on their own?

I definitely got sassy, but never rude. I asked him if he had a mom, sister, or aunt and how he would feel if a man talked to them like this.

I know this sounds insane, but this eating disorder voice keeps trying to derail me without me even realizing.   \n\n\nI've tried to tell different members of my family, to reach out for help, but... Even the family members that care the most just do not understand. I got tears in my eyes trying to tell my Grandad, who raised me, and he replied after a moment's thought \"Well, people with REAL eating disorders produce cortisol, which...\"... It was a science fact that didn't really help me, LOL. I lost hope at him underlining 'people with REAL eating disorders'. My older brother, who cares so much for me, patronized me with 'awwww, that's not good', like I was a little girl who was showing him a splinter in my finger.   \n\n\nThe dear, dear friend to me... He wants me to talk to him about these things, but I can't do it - I can't go back to him and say 'I've fucked up again, I'm straight back at square one'.   \n\n\nI had one experience during my recovery, where I had eaten liberally that day (not overboard, just liberally)... And I was sitting there with a strange feeling in my stomach. I was sort of confused-smiling; this is weird, but nice! This is really weird, though... I didn't even recognize my stomach being full.   \n\n\nTo conclude all of this, I'm just... tired of having to stay one step ahead of my own brain. That's the most perfect way I could put it. I don't know how to get myself back onto that kick ass road to recovery that I was on. I'm back at square one, but it feels worse. Please advise me, please someone tell me how to be mentally healthy again instead of this stupid, obsessive thinking.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Recovery is possible and by no means do I want to discourage anyone from trying to get better! This is a long rant about my personal recovery fuck up that I needed to get off my chest and my views are hugely distorted by my mental health issues, so if you proceed, please keep that in mind!\n\n\n\n\nFucking lol. What can I say except congratulations, me, you played yourself.\nIt sounds awful, but I wish I never told anyone and never tried to \"get better\". In hindsight, maybe it would have been better to just go on and die. \n\n\nWell, what happened instead is that I decided to seek help, told my parents and got into therapy and whatnot. I got to a healthy weight and started eating regularly. It was miserable, but I pushed through it, because I thought I would finally be able to live a semi-normal life again. Joke was on me tho (and also everyone else), haha. Brain decided it was time to prank itself and literally everyone else around and instead of gradually improving my eating habits, I developed BED. Just lol. Honestly I don't know whether this is tragic or just plain funny. \nBut guess I should have expected it, because of course I manage to fuck up every single attempt at happiness I make. Every. Single. One.\n\n\nSo yeah, now I'm not only miserable but also actually medically fat. Therapists and psychiatrists don't know what to do with me anymore, so I think they just gave up, lol. At least I can stand up without fainting now, amirite? Huge success! Might develop diabetes later, but who cares about that. Enjoy the moment!\n\n\nIt's horrible, but I think a lot about how I was better off starving myself. Sure, it was equally miserable, but at least others didn't treat me like shit just for existing. The difference in how people treated me at low/average weight is fucking devastating. At least I could live my life without being called a fatty or landwhale by people I haven't harmed in any way. People didn't talk behind my back about how fat I got and pretend to vomit. At least everyone would leave me alone. It's honestly all I want now. I don't talk to anyone. I barely go outside. I hide under tons of clothing in summer and just keep my eyes on the sidewalk. I don't care about being \"happy\" or \"healthy\" anymore, I just want to disappear. I really wish I could blame this on something else than myself, but this is my fault entirely for not having any damn self control. I fucked my whole life up even more when trying to get better. I don't try anything anymore. It's meaningless. It just gets worse every time I try. \n\n\nI just endure everything and hide myself at home so no one has to look at me. I scroll through my old pictures, crying, because I used to look so pretty and yet I couldn't see it at the time. I eat and eat and eat in order to make the emptiness disappear, but it never does. Then I cut and burn and scratch my skin, because I resent it and it resents me. Sometimes I spend hours trying to make myself vomit, thinking about how... subhuman I am in the eyes of everyone. Sometimes I spice it up with some pathetic half assed suicide attempts, why not lol. \n\n\nSo yeah, haha. Pranked myself real good here. Imagine spending years struggling to break free and it's all for literally nothing. I can't fathom my stupidity back then. I should have just died. \n\nI can only blame myself and I would do anything to get better or at least go back, but I don't know how and neither does anyone else. I can say I honestly tried. I can say I struggled as much as I could. I used all of my resources. But maybe some people are just meant to be failures. Ugly, stupid, jaded, bitter, worthless meat shells with a disease-ridden brain. \nAnd even if I had any purpose besides being a depressed mess, I'm not able to see it or act on it anyway, because all I can think about is my appearance, so I might as well be called a complete waste of air. \n\n\nOof.

I wasn\u2019t in the best place leading up to winter and around November I started losing weight.  I live in northeast and winters can be pretty brutal up here. I also work at a busy restaurant in a ski town where we are very short staffed. I am one of two busers that work there, and my coworker/buser is very lazy and would show up intoxicated most shifts and would generally do very little, leaving me to bus almost the whole restaurant on my own. I had already started to lose weight around November and by the time mid January arrived I had gotten really skinny. Around this time business really started to pick up as we entered busy season. I was stretched so thin at work that all shift I'd pretty much have to run around and do damage control. So on top of my eating disorder I was dealing with a lot of stress from work. And all my coworkers noticed. However, none of them thought I had an eating disorder and all of them thought I had a coke problem. They talked about it a lot behind my back. I have Bipolar, which I had been off my meds for, and paired with my lack of eating, had greatly thrown off my mood. My coworkers noticed this as well and wrongly attributed this to cocaine. It progressively got worse until mid march where business slowly down and I moved into a new apartment. I was less stressed out and I began eating more. My coworkers then started to show me more support and would often ask about how I was doing with the new apartment. That was nice to receive but it still hurt a lot to have everyone think I was addicted to coke when I was struggling with anorexia. People judged me, lost respect for me, and spread rumors about me. I don\u2019t like playing the victim card but I honestly feel a little betrayed and thought my coworkers would have had more respect for me than that. What gets me is that those two things are very different and if someone would have reached out to me they might have discovered what was up, but instead of reaching out to me they all just talked about it behind my back.

For example, I used to eat multiple Pink Lady apples per day, and used eating them as an eating disordered behavior for sure. Now, my stomach turns at the thought of eating them. The individual flavor is fine, if I take a bite, but I feel sick to my stomach if I eat more than that, like I'm going to get diarrhea or a sick stomach.

{"post_id": "cez7in", "created_utc": 1563488615, "title": "Recovery questions", "author": "thomel02", "self_text": " Sorry this turned out so long...\n\nSo I have had anorexia (restricting subtype) combined with over-exercise for about 11 years now. I was diagnosed at age 15 and I'm 26 now. I've been in therapy almost the entire time because my parents live close to me and I'm also just close to my family in general. I also have been inpatient twice, though I wasn't fully committed to it either time (partially because I'm still very adamant that the goal weight they set for me is way too high and partially because I was somewhat coerced into it by my parents). Anyway, I'm finally seeing a therapist that I really like and trust that was trained through the program at the hospital where I was inpatient and she knows my psychiatrist I see at the hospital very well. She's very understanding and is much more willing to meet me where I am, whereas some of the therapists I have seen in the past have been very punitive and berated me if I lost any weight at all when I saw them or admitted that I had acted on my eating disorder. My current therapist is much more holistic. She and I agreed upon a contract because I have been seeing her since January and my weight has not increased (It did go up a little, but I lost it all when she was away for two weeks on her honeymoon.) She recommended a higher level of care about two months ago, but I refused. Thus the contract. She did agree to see me twice a week, though, in lieu of going inpatient. In the contract, I have to gain a certain amount of weight in four weeks (though that number is not set in stone and she says if she legitimately sees me trying, (i.e. increase my intake and decrease exercise, she would not stop seeing me solely based on my weight.), vary my food choices, exercise only four times a week for 30 minutes (I was exercising A LOT more than that previously, so even going down to that is tough), and deal with my emotions and thoughts by using coping skills. If I can't manage to do those things, she said that she will recommend a higher level of care and she cannot see me on an outpatient basis anymore. I really like her and for some reason I have been a bit more motivated since I have been working with her, so I really don't want to stop seeing her (especially because she is like the 7th therapist I have seen so far and by far my favorite).\n\nAnyway, I don't know if I have a clear question. **How does everyone deal with moderating exercise during recovery?** I am so freaked out that I'm going to gain so much weight even if I take a day off of exercise, so having to take three days off during a week is so hard to conceive of, especially because I'm also eating a lot more than I was when I was restricting. The crazy thing is I have been eating a lot more for about two weeks and exercising at least a little bit less and I haven't gained a pound yet. Yet I still fear that this trend won't continue and I will start rapidly gaining weight. **Also, how do you reconcile gaining weight when you are not that underweight?** I have about 9-10 pounds to gain before I am not considered underweight anymore, but that seems so insignificant compared to how little I weighed at my lowest weight when I was first diagnosed. **Finally, how do you deal with increasing your intake while living alone?** It's so easy to lie and say I ate something/didn't exercise, but I know that is only going to strengthen my eating disorder and I will never gain weight if I do that. This is the first time I've really been in recovery and actually put forth some effort without my parents having a say in what I eat (as was the case basically through college). So basically I'm looking for any **recovery tips or things that made recovery easier for someone that initially went through treatment with a lot of supervision from family, but eventually you lived on your own and had to choose it for yourself.**\n\nTL;DR I have had my eating disorder for 11 years (diagnosed at age 15, now I'm 26). I'm finally trying to commit to recovery and I love my therapist. What are some recovery tips that made it easier for someone that initially had a lot of family support (making meals, having supervision) but now has to decide what choices to make on their own? Especially with regards to exercise, how do you go without exercise and not have a complete panic attack?", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I don\u2019t know what to think of this.  its unfair to say that its her parents fault, right? i dont know. maybe it is both facts that she\u2019s not happy with herself and her family that makes her want to ruin her body.\n\nmy friend says that deep down she doesnt want to get better. she says \u201canorexia keeps me in check\u201d im not exactly sure what that means, but   what i get is that she wants to be sure that she is staying fit, and she thinks being anorexic is the only way she can do that. i just know that her saying it keeps her in check is absolute bullshit.\n\nshe also says that once she reaches the weight she wants to be at, she\u2019ll stop trying to lose weight and diet. im not so sure.  how is she going to stop calorie counting? obsessing over her weight and weighing herself every single morning? and doesn\u2019t anorexia distort your way of seeing yourself?... so, logically, she\u2019d never get better with the way she is seeing herself! my goodness, and she says she\u2019s got it under control and that she\u2019s fine. \n\n she\u2019s going to be on food therapy soon, i dont know for how long, but she isnt going to like it and i dont think it will fix much about being anorexic other than keeping her body alive. she says she doesnt need to go to the hospital, although she recently got meds, but i dont think she\u2019s taking them regularly.\n\ni guess im just trying to understand anorexia more and im asking for advice on how to respond to what she tells me. thank u for reading all this if you did.  i really really do appreciate it. tell me what i should do or about your experiences", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

So I pre logged and prepped my 800 cals worth of food that i was allowed. Work wasn't going well and my anxiety was high enough for me to take one of the hydroxizine I'm prescribed. I get really sleepy and kind of fog eat when I take them. I slipped and ate some saltines, then some orange slices, and finally a snack sized can of pringles that we sell to guests (200 cals). I then said fuck it, I'll get a burger and just throw the day away. \nEnded up eating three medium sized chicken tenders and 8 fries with honey mustard in the dark car on my ride home, sharing the fries with my boyfriend. Even with this \"binge,\" i still would have been within my large calorie limit (1300) but I felt like such a disgusting blimp that I almost panicked. \nThis is how I'm learning, though. Like I can be okay eating 1300 calories throughout the day if it's the RIGHT FOOD. If it's the wrong food, I don't care if it was just a bite, I feel the need to get rid of it. So we get home and I beeline for the bathroom, lock the door, and proceed to very noisily get it back up. It choked me the whole time because I wasn't originally planning to purge and therefore didn't have any water, and who would want to purge all that fried and breaded stuff?\n It took a long time, but I couldn't give up. I'd stop and look at what I got out, take a deep breath and put my fingers back. I feel like i was teaching myself a lesson. I'm so scared of the damage purging can do, which is why i wasn't any good at it in the beginning and never made it part of my routine. Tonight, though, i justified it well enough that I'm willing to do it again. I had to do it and I felt so powerful and in control afterwards. No normal girl would do that to herself. I looked at myself in the mirror and told myself good job. I'd rather deal with a sore throat tomorrow than the guilt and disgust I felt after eating. \nAfter I purged, my boyfriend asked if I was throwing up in there and if it was on purpose. I barely even lied, just said it didn't sit well and I felt better now. I have a work friend who knows I restrict and have disordered behavior, but knows better than to stop me. Instead he's there with whatever I need when I've gone too far. (He is very experienced in fitness and nutrition and a bit of emergency health care. He's already saved me from passing out once.) I don't lie to him about anything, but I might lie to him about this. Me purging is one of his biggest worries and I just let it come true. He will ask again if I'm doing it and I don't know what to say. \nSorry, my first post is a long one but I haven't purged in such a long time and I felt good about it and had to unpack that a little.

I've binged more or less every day which led me to so much nausea, bloatedness and shame that I've had to cancel plans and avoid going out or had to sleep away the physical pain that comes with it. \n\nI've even avoided writing about it in my diary since Ive felt too ashamed to admit it to myself.

It makes me feel kind of alone; like what I'm feeling isn't real, i guess.\n\nMy problem is that a while back I used to believe that being over 95 pounds would be the end of the world for me. There were outside influences like celebrities and past experiences that I'm guessing caused me to think that, which led me to count every single calorie, obsess over being skinny and flat out try to eat the least amount of food possible. When I reached 105 pounds (inevitably), I had a complete breakdown: tears and all. It felt like I will never be beautiful again, and I started eating even less. I did find a person who I looked up to, who, not so gently, explained to me why my goal of being under 100 pounds is \"literally idiotic\" and made me realize that this was not the way to go. That's when I started seeing how truly horrible my body looked. I had no curves, no cushion anywhere, I could literally wrap my hand around my ankles and wrists. I began to hate myself again, but for a different reason. And so, I began eating and gaining weight and my figure was changing into what I now wanted it to look like... Only it stopped before I was satisfied. I'm still underweight, and I still do not look good to myself. I can't even look at myself in the mirror without hating my skinny legs and arms and just wanting to not be in my body for once.

{"post_id": "cffrd8", "created_utc": 1563584052, "title": "Hard Year Vent", "author": "Haunting_Bird", "self_text": "I grew up with overweight parents who constantly had disordered eating habits. Their weights fluctuated often and all they focused on was food, dieting, exercising, etc., and they dragged me along for all of that as a child. I feel as if I've always associated being overweight and eating unhealthy foods with body image and guilt. They've now both had surgery to lose weight, yet still talk about it incessantly. I feel like I was bred to have an ed (and it worked). I remember the first time someone called me fat was in kindergarten. My pediatrician once kept me for three hours in 5th grade to degrade me about dieting and weight, despite being within the normal weight range and being healthy. I spiraled out of control in 9th grade and lost so much weight that my hair drastically thinned out. My weight fluctuated a lot in high school, but I've never felt good about myself. My first semester of college was really hard. I stopped eating completely with the exception of some fruit and coffee. I self harmed a lot. My second semester, I was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia. I lost maybe 22 kg and still thought I looked disgusting (being bald and being in so much physical and emotional pain didn't help). As painful as treatment was, I enjoyed not eating and I was devastated when they gave me a feeding tube. After chemo, I was put on steroids and I gained 30kg. It's been 6 months and I can't get the weight off at all. I weigh more than I've ever weighed, I look really funny because my hair is growing in and it's a peculiar length, and the chemo made me go through menopause at 18 and gain weight in my stomach.\n\nI like a lot of aspects of myself, but I feel so hopeless because of my body. I'm supposed to start school again in the fall (I had to drop out because I was so sick), and I'm embarrassed to back because of how I look and feel. I hate putting on tight clothes and feeling the skin on my body. A lot of my \"friends\" dropped me when I was sick because I had to live in the hospital. I'm scared and excited to starve myself when I go back to school. I only feel confident when I'm starving, even if I'm emotionally distressed, because it's the only thing I can control. I can't eat without feeling sad and guilty. I can't look in the mirror or take photos with friends without feeling disgusted. I've never talked to anyone about this. I can't talk to my parents about it because they've already been through so much and I don't want them to feel like it's their fault that I behave this way. I can't talk to my doctors about it because they'll put me in the hospital (my physical health after cancer is pretty delicate). I feel awkward talking to my therapist about it. I tried to mention it once, but I lost confidence. I feel invalidated because I'm overweight. I'm sad because I can't fit into a lot of my fashionable clothes anymore, and I look bad in what I can fit into. I feel really hopeless and this is me just screeching into the void I guess.

Gaining weight, and now facing obesity-related issues, bullying, harassment from my family about my weight, etc, I became ashamed of my compulsive eating, and my long binges. I started getting \"better\" (aka not gaining weight as fast, and making better nutritional choices), but then on April 1st of 2015, my sister committed suicide. \n\nAll control threw itself out of the window. Since then, I have gained 80 pounds, meaning about 26 per year, over double what it was. I now eat until I throw up (Not voluntary throwing up, it happens because of the amount I'm eating.) This makes my acid reflux go crazy, and I have thrown up blood before from the acid messing with the lining of my throat. I eat and feel satisfied and happy, and then hate myself. \nI have 7 stash spots in my room that I eat from, and don't tell anyone about. I'm considered morbidly obese, and I am miserable. \nI can't stand food, I hate my relationship with food and my relationship with my body, but it's almost the same as a drug addiction. I just...can't get myself to stop. I feel so alone in this and just need someone to care or maybe help me figure out what the first step I should take would be? I'm scared and don't want it to get worse, I want to recover, I want to be better, and be healthy. \n\nThanks if any of you read this. It's 2AM so a lot was rambly and not well organized, but I'm hoping someone will understand. Thank you \u2665\ufe0f", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

However, the video itself just felt very underwhelming. I wish Shane asked better questions/told less insensitive jokes.I can\u2019t help but feel as if many points of her Ed and recovery were glossed over/not talked about in detail. I get that\u2019s it\u2019s a private thing and the video had good intentions but it just felt incomplete. She still seemed in denial of her ED and she only stayed in treatment for like a month. Also, why were their locks not eh door that she didn\u2019t know how to open and a metal bar that Shane needed to lift for her to open the door in her own home? Another thing I wanted to point out was the situation with her mother is weirdly unsettling. Watching her old videos and I always found her mom and their relationship sort of off. There were a few speculations that her mother had been abusing her and That she suffered from Munchausen by proxy. Like how did her mother never intervene and take her to the doctor for years until the intervention. Surely she knew something was wrong. Like your daughter is clearly sick. I also heard that she even called the cops on Eugenia\u2019s friends for kidnapping when she found out her daughter was being taken to the hospital. The whole situation is weird. How did she live such a lonely, sheltered life even with her family?. I also heard that she was bullied in school, which also could have been a reason for her disorder. Overall though, I feel like the situation isn\u2019t as simple as its made seem and something deeper is definitely going on. I can\u2019t help but think that the fact that she has to go through with her recovery and problems all under the public eye will be incredibly difficult for her.

We are in our first year of college and are living together now but her bulimia has never been so bad. I have tried talking to her parents about it to get her help but they are the most delusional people ever and are almost in denial over her ED. Our friendship has turned very toxic over the past couple of years, she is manipulative, attention seeking and so untrustworthy and she is losing a lot of friends. I am finding it really hard to feel sorry for her anymore because of the nasty person she is. Over the semester break she claimed to have gotten better but upon returning to college after spending a week back in our home town but she is obviously lying. It is really affecting my own mental health now to the point where I was diagnosed with depression last year and I feel so helpless, talking to her is impossible and I don't want to be responsible for the life long consequences she is going to have to face or even if she were to die and I feel like living with her is just condoning these behaviours. My next plan of action is to tell her parents again that nothing has improved and that I can no longer live with her, in hopes that they will bring her home and put her in full time help. I also want out of the friendship because of the huge impact this has had on my mental health, I am a completely different person to who I used to be. I know having an eating disorder is not her fault, but after 3 years of trying to help and having it refused and being walked all over I can't do this anymore. I am just after some reassurance that telling her parents to bring her home is the right thing to do and any other suggestions are welcome too.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I feel as if I don\u2019t deserve love or any sort of physical attention. two years ago I began throwing up after every intake of calories and also restricted myself heavily (an iced coffee for breakfast, a flapjack at school which I threw up, and a small dinner. and copious amounts of Diet Coke). so I lost a bunch of weight. I never told my therapist at the time as I was so ashamed of my behaviour. at the time my best friend had been admitted to hospital for anorexia and i confided in my therapist with all of my worries and guilt concerning the amount of mental weight I was put under due to being her one venting system. I felt disgusting that I would self inflict disordered behaviours when she was so sick. however doing all of this gave me something to focus on when, for what felt like years at this point, my life was otherwise falling apart .\n\nat the time I was studying for my a levels and isolated from friends that I used to be close with. I started to study at home alone as my mother was at work and my father still ill enough I felt as if I was second hand caring for him but stayed in my room most of the time, unsupervised.\n\nlong story short, I lost a fuck ton of weight. I hate to mention numbers as I know they\u2019re triggering but I got to 45 kg which is the lowest weight I\u2019ve ever been since the age of  9/12 (always been a bit chubby). and no one noticed. I opened up to my mum a few months ago about how much I had been struggling and she (who has also struggled with EDs in the past) told me she knew I had been thin but pushed any concerns to the back of her mind. but friends and teachers didn\u2019t notice. \n\nI\u2019m now at uni and back at a healthy weight but these disordered thoughts are more prevalent than ever. I\u2019m on the waiting list for therapy but I\u2019m at 52-56 kg (I\u2019m 5\u2019 3\u201d and have yet to get scales since coming to uni so i weigh myself every few months at home) and I know they won\u2019t be worried or take my thoughts seriously if I arrive at an above healthy weight. people tell me they think I\u2019m tiny when I confide in them and that I don\u2019t need to lose weight but I feel as if it\u2019s taking over my life. I feel so ashamed I gained weight when I\u2019d spent so long restricting and manage to get to 45. I feel as if my whole life is on hold until I lose weight yet I can\u2019t stop myself from eating, or the guilty thoughts after. I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m posting on here. I suppose I just feel helpless.\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever going to be sick enough. I\u2019m never going to warrant people worrying over me or people hoping I\u2019m okay. No one ever notices how much I\u2019m struggling and I feel as if that will only happen if I lose loads of weight but it just feels like a losing battle because I never can. or at least not keep it off. I sometimes think I\u2019m going to live the rest of my life comparing myself and never feeling worthy enough.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

You get to log the times you ate which is displayed on the side of the path, and the amount of time between each meal.\n\nYou then have the option to answer questions about the food you ate (eg. Why did you eat it, did it taste nice, where did you eat it, how hungry were you before and after, etc).\n\nYou can also customise the questions to suit you and what you want, for instance I have \"did you purge it?\" and \"does it contain any animal products?\" (I'm trying to cut down on the amount of animal products I eat). \n\nThe answers to the questions are shown in a weekly summary on simple pie charts  and it makes you more mindful of what you eat, without the focus being on calories or macros too much.\n\nFor now I'm using it as well as MFP but I'm only using that to meal plan and quickly calculate my macros to put onto ate.\n\nEdit: FTTZ-MQR3 is my code if you want to add me on it!", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Yesterday I shared a post on here relaying my experience with a particular kind of elimination diet and the success I had had in basically putting my decades-long binge-eating into remission.  I am not a therapist of any kind and my intention was not to give advice, but merely make people aware of the way of eating I have benefited from.  I believe that in a number of cases binge eating is - at least in part - caused by a carbohydrate addiction (although in not all cases).  I respect people who disagree with me because everyone has a different experience of their ED, and this is a very complex disorder.\n\nMany people were upset and initially I was annoyed because I felt I was being attacked for merely trying to share helpful information.  While I do not agree with the aggression that was initially directed at me, I've had the chance to sleep on it and I just wanted to say that I am sorry for coming on the forum with my post.  My intention was not to upset anyone, and I think I misunderstood or misinterpreted the purpose of this forum (as a safe space/support group).  I also understand that what I was saying is unconventional and that there are a lot of snake oil salesmen out there.  While I still do believe that my experience has been life-changing, the internet is a contextless environment where I do not know who will be reading my posts, where they are coming from, and what state of mind they are in.  I deleted the original post, although the thread naturally still remains.  My intentions were good as I know the intense struggle of this disorder, but they were not well-focussed.  Having said all that, once again I am sorry.\n\nI hope everyone has a nice day.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I know I'm on a verge of a relapse, but I'm gonna try not to!!!\n\nI got high off of cough syrup a total of 3 times. I'm warning all of y'all not to do it, I literally felt like I was gonna die. You don't even feel high high, you just feel dizzy and almost puke on the bed (I mean I wouldn't have mind but still). Like if you wanna get high, just do weed, or drink tea that works too. \n\nAnd lastly, I have a strange addiction to peanut butter.\n\nMaybe I'll make another update and a month or so!", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

At 13, a graham cracker would break my spirit. At 29, I ballroom dance with my eating disorder with fortitude and grace, leading and always a step ahead.\n\nI hate to admit this, but hey, you\u2019re the internet. I\u2019m a licensed and registered dietitian. Also a certified personal trainer. I made that decision when I was \u201cbetter\u201d and I wanted to help others. I\u2019ve always enjoyed biology and sports, so I thought it was a good idea. (*Laughs in hindsight*)\n\nIn case you don\u2019t know, dietitians do more than weight loss and counseling. I actually manage a food service operation: food biology and sanitation, menu spreads, training food staff, cooking procedures, ensuring compliance with state/federal regulations, and then clinical nutrition (think: I monitor your electrolytes for your kidney disease).\n\nI\u2019m a manager. I walk around and help my employees daily; anywhere from 14,000-29,000 steps per day. I\u2019m the Go-To person for food questions. Cooking? Cleaning? Taste? Appearance? Combination? Caloric value? Protein value? Me, me, me. I decide which color plate the dinner is served on. I decide if so-so and can have that texture for their particular diet. I decide everything in relation to food. I\u2019m in control. The physician speaks to me when she has questions regarding nutrition. The nurse practitioner asks me for the latest research regarding nutrition. The patient asks me how to incorporate more fiber into his diet.\n\nI can no longer categorize myself as an anorectic due to DSMV guidelines; my BMI is in normal range. Orthorexic? I can taste the potassium sorbate preservative in the prunes at work and it makes my skin crawl. It has to be real, whole, food.\n\n* I work out early in the morning, before work, daily: What a great athlete and dietitian! Makes sense.\n* My body fat is in the teens: Makes sense! She\u2019s a dietitian!\n* I eat healthy and I\u2019m applauded: What a great dietitian! What an example!\n* I\u2019m analytical about food: She\u2019s a great manager, really pays attention to detail. That\u2019s why she has that job.\n* I eat cake in pre-portioned/ already calculated in my head/ pre-determined amounts/fits my limit: She\u2019s real! She eats cake without care!\n\nI have been dropping weight. As my body fat percentage drops downward, my concentration has increased. I feel sharp as a tack. I have a cup of coffee on my empty stomach and I feel invincible. A little Patrick Bateman. I multi-task, I finish what I start, I always follow-through, and I do it all with a big smile. I\u2019m always on time, I\u2019ll always go the extra mile. And best of all, I\u2019m NOT a doormat. I\u2019m actually a pretty confident, straight-forward, logical, and ethical person. (less Patrick Bateman)\n\nI calculated everything: I can still eat my cake, my ice cream, and other crap. A graham cracker is okay, I\u2019ve budgeted for mistakes. I\u2019m like a robot. And it feels quite stale to say that out loud. But what is the alternative? My messy, stupid, emotions? No, thank you.\n\nI\u2019ve done this so many times. I\u2019m 29, for fucks sake. My emotions don\u2019t get me anywhere. I\u2019m done with my emotions.\n\nI\u2019m zoning out my boyfriend. Why isn\u2019t he accomplishing everything like me? I\u2019m too concentrated on my To Do list that is literally never-ending. But if I\u2019m not doing the To Do list, who is?! I have to! I have to set the alarms! Check the cabinets for our stock of foods. Water the plants. Grocery shop! Cook! Clean! Arrange the pillows on the couch! Get up at 6am to diligently work on my mobility. Laundry twice a week. Cut my own hair once a month. I count our money down to the quarters; it all counts. I have to prune all our plants. I have to call my grandma weekly! I have to dust because I can\u2019t stand it. I have to smile at everyone at work with precision\u2014enough to let them know I\u2019m friendly but not too much to let them think I\u2019m brainless. Dishes can\u2019t sit in the sink. I can\u2019t sit anywhere. I have to move!\n\nI\u2019m not even sad. This is life. And when I fall off the wagon, which I know I will, it\u2019s okay too. Get up and dust yourself off. I think that\u2019s the strangest fact of all this: I am not even fazed anymore.\n\nMy eating disorder is no longer only food. My eating disorder is 18 years old, mature and aged. It has spread into every facet of my life, spread out like lightning bolts. I can see my eating disorder so clearly. I feel like I\u2019m floating above my own body, watching everything unfold.\n\nWhat came first- the chicken or the egg? What came first- my eating disorder or my personality? Who am I?\n\nI've calculated for these feelings too. It's okay to question. But the only thing to do is keep moving. I can't sit in these questions.", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

I stated that I'm literally afraid of eating Mexican or Indian ect because of how many calories it is and her response 'oh it's ok I don't like eating it either, it's so greasy and they use too much oil and butter anyways'. I tell her that even though I'm eating candy while 'dieting' it's only okay and 'safe' because I know exactly how many calories it is and she replies 'well that's why you aren't losing weight! If you're on a diet you have to eat clean whole foods! Rice is very healthy eat some rice! Just eat homecooked food, and you will lose weight'. Even though I literally just explained that the concept of NOT knowing what's in my food is what scares me, therefore the delicious food mom makes with unknown amounts of oil, meats, seasonings, veggies, would be terrifying to me as opposed to a gummy strip that I know is exactly 37.6 calories per strip. My dad said that as long as I don't eat after 6pm and skip breakfast I wont gain weight like it's normal to just fast for 18 hours everyday. I just... I thought that my attitude towards food was abnormal, and part of disordered thinking, but hearing my mom and dad unfazed by anything and just say 'its okay' to all of my issues is so invalidating and now I'm wondering if I even have a disorder in the first place.

But after a few particularly bad binge cycles I decided to take advice and eat \u201cnormally\u201d with a schedule. I started out with a bit of fruit once in my office, then I\u2019d eat at night and that was that. Recently I\u2019ve been opting to bring light sandwich as well (with that 35 cal per slice bread of aldi that TOTALLY derailed my perception of regular bread servings). So I\u2019m eating about 200-300 calories before 6:00 PM which is pretty usual and not at all indulgent? Right?\n\nEveryone has this complaint but coworkers are always inviting me to lunch and I keep refusing or at least going and only buying coffee or something\u2014but for the sake of recovery I\u2019ve gone with more and more. Still not eating with them but at least I\u2019m participating. Except I binged and purged HARD at the office potluck and I felt absolutely awful the next day. Which is when they invited me to and Indian food buffet\u2014which is my dream situation because (1) I love Indian food and (2) buffets are where you can go to town with minimal judgement right? I knew I\u2019d feel even worse if I went, and I\u2019m sure my throat would\u2019ve felt even more raw with spices, and honestly I was barely dealing with the commentary on my nine plates of food the day prior.\n\nSo I said I couldn\u2019t go, and I didn\u2019t even have a financial excuse because it was paid for by our boss. I had to explain how I felt sick yadda yadda, but how I still felt okay to go to work etc. My coworker who\u2019s in the same office space as me then commented something along the lines of \u201cmakes sense you can\u2019t go since you always bring a lot of food.\u201d I hadn\u2019t brought lunch that day, but holy shit did that throw me off. A lot of food? Does he think I\u2019m a pig? Why did he use that tone? Why comment at all? \n\nI was just trying to make a good personal choice ya know?! Avoid an u healthy environment. And then he unknowingly shamed me for eating a handful of cherries with a ham and cheese sandwich once in a while. While they were gone for lunch I heated up some broccoli and then I worked out like crazy when I was off and tried reassuring myself it\u2019s a normal meal and that it\u2019s okay to eat in the day. Idk it just really stuck with me. Doesn\u2019t help he allegedly doesn\u2019t usually take lunch and works out everyday.

He just knows that I have issues with controlling my eating.

I don't want to be one of those boring fuckers who are \"in recovery\" forever and whose life is a \"constant battle\" against their disorder. It's not me. The real me doesn't give two fucks about calories, weight decimals and all that shit. The real me just want to eat a sandwich for lunch and get on with his day.\n\nYet I can't. Last time I've tried to recover I worked with a therapist and a dietitian. The therapist focused on my non-existent family issues, my common and irrelevant insecurities and my body image which has been badly compromised by my ED - I was not that much heavier than now but I was so much better proportioned, while now I just look like a lifeless potato with no muscle. The dietitian focused on getting me to my before-ED previous \"natural\" weight, only to be puzzled when I was still hungry as fuck - not being able to sleep kind of hungry - and prescribed me an appetite suppressant. No seriously. How on Earth can you even begin the process of thinking to prescribe appetite suppressants to someone with a restrictive ED. It's like prescribing cocaine to a heroine addict.\n\nSo I inevitably relapsed, and now I'm here, desperate for a change that never comes. I know how a normal person eats, I perfectly remember how I used to eat; it's just that it would never ever satisfy me now. I am never satisfied by normal meals. Nothing fully satisfies me. I feel like my choices are either letting my hunger loose and become infinitely obese as a result, or restricting forever and constantly being the weirdo who embarasses himself by pretending he doesn't like that food and is into healthy/diet stuff. I can feel the others watching and silently sighing whenever I prepare my meals, and I can feel myself being ashamed yet unable to behave differently.\n\nI am not like that. I've never been like that. I don't want to be like that. But I guess I am actually like that, and I will just be like that forever.\n\nI hate that this happened to me. It's just awful and sometimes I don't think I am strong enough to sustain it for much longer.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Like, it's not weird for me to occasionally be the tallest person in the room. and if im wearing heels? forget about it. i could slam dunk on these dudes. shirts versus skins bitch see u on the court. \nregardless, I hate my height (like...a lot. its a serious deep insecurity that ive grappled with for a long time) but it's chill, i'm learbing to come to terms with my string bean built body.\n\nThat being said? I prefer a guy taller than me. im ready for a fuckin tall king so i can finally feel like the Tiny Ballernina Skinny Queen that the 13 yr old edgelord in me so desperatley wants to be. And like if im standing next to a really tall guy, i'll feel normal sized as opposed to the BEAST that i feel like half the time. \n\n THAT BEING SAID AGAIN,  tinder for me has become this dance of figuring out how to find out a guys' heigh without flat out asking (which, btw, i became REALLY good at....like i was on some fbi shit lol.), because i think if, in response, someone flat asked me how much i weighed i can't even imagine the restricting cycle that that would push me into lmao. because even if he's saying it in a \"witty haha internet joke\" way, ofc i'd interpret it as \"how much do you weigh bc your pics make you look like a PIG. oink oink lardass.\" it got to the point where scrolling they r/tinder and seeing those posts became triggering for me.\n\nIt eventually became such a big source of anxiety in dating - like i would match w someone and we'd get to talking and he might be really cool! but realistically im not looking to date a guy shorter than me! being w short/small guys in a romantic context make me feel fucking HUGE. like christ. so i DONT WANNA DO IT.

Fr, only full fledged bozo the clown mfs say shit like 'i'd only date a girl under __ lbs' bc everyone with hlf a brain knows that weight looks differenlt on different people. they're just asking to offend and hurt the other person.  \n\nit just seems especially fucked considering the statistics on ed's, and how prevelant body issues are, that dudes are jumping on this trend for internet clout with no regard for how deeply it might effect the person they're asking. imagine triggering someones eating disorder for internet points.......that's clown shit, sir. \n\nlike ok u might be bummed that a girl isnt interested in short dudes, but that weight comment would probably stick with me so long and fw my self esteem in a way that's so deeply unhealthy when, alternatively,  it would cost 0 dollars and 0 cents to just shut the fuck up.\n\n(eventually, the anxiety and worrying just wasnt worth it and the dudes i was meeting were all duds so i just deleted the app, but this was something that really really bothered me during my time on it.)", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Try to silence the voice in your head that tries to convince you it was 100 calories instead of 50. Hide the stock cube wrap in the bin to prevent your mom from seeing it.\n\nh 12.00: be hungry and miserable. \n\nh 12.30: eat another 3 cherries and promise yourself it's the last time you binge.\n\nh 12.40: go to the nearest store and buy a new Diet Coke because you finished the last one. Bring your own bag to prevent your mom from seeing you with the grocery bags. Also finish this new bottle. Be super nervous because you had too much caffeine.\n\nh 13.00: it's lunch time! You are \"in recovery\" so you are having lunch, and your mom is in front of you so you have to eat something marginally decent, but you can't go over a certain caloric amount. Be torn and anxious for the whole time. Eat something that you don't like and doesn't satisfy you one bit. Drink some other Diet Coke and maybe one cherry as a \"nice post-lunch treat\" because people in recovery do enjoy treats don't they.\n\nh 14.00: convince yourself that lunch filled you and you're actually not going to eat anything until dinner.\n\nh 15.00: go to the grocery shop to buy some other Coke. Walk there so that you can keep yourself busy for the longest time possible and also burn those nasty cherry calories. But exercise doesn't count, so add 200 calories to account for those you didn't burn exercising.\n\nh 16.00: fidget like crazy and watch ED recovery videos to \"motivate yourself\".\n\nh 17.00: time for a snack! Salad with a quarter of a raw bell pepper and half a spoonful of balsamic vinegar. Immediately be angry with yourself because you let yourself go.\n\nh 18.00: eat some cherries because you're so hungry. You eat around 10 cherries. Weigh the remaining cherries to get an idea of how many calories were in the ones you ate. 10 large cherries weigh around 80-100 g, so it's like 40-50 calories. Better round them up to 200 to be extra safe. You never know with fruit do you. Why the fuck doesn't everyone put calories on fruit, can SOMEONE think of ED sufferers for once???\n\nh. 19.30: dinner time. So this weird combination has 300 calories. This other one is slightly less weird and you like it more but it has 350 calories and would put you 50 calories above your calorie limit. But what if you eat the first combination and then get hungry later? Better choose the second one and just remove the extra 50 calories by \"accidentally\" dropping them on the floor. Avoid your mom sideglances.\n\nh 20.30: drink your last liter of Diet Coke for the day. \"Oh mom don't worry caffeine actually helps me to sleep!\", yeah right lol.\n\nh 22.00: mentally count all the calories you ingested during the day. Add 200 to account for all those extra hidden calories (like what if they labelled the Diet Coke wrong and it was actually regular Coke?) and the obvious underestimation. Plan how many calories you have to eat for the rest of the week to stay within your budget. \n\nh 2.30 AM: be hungry and miserable but the caffeine keeps you awake and you gotta stay up until late so that you can also wake up later and skip breakfast easier the next day.\n\nh 3.00 AM: go to bed while dreaming of all the foods you'll be able to eat once you'll be \"done restricting\".", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I was a fairly healthy 165lbs when I got married, a little overweight going by BMI calculators, but I was a gym junkie and would work out between 7 and 10 times a week so I am confident in saying that I carried a little more muscle than the average person. I was in a really good place. \n\nThen I moved to the USA. Very little is in walking distance from me, I share a car so can\u2019t always get to the gym after work, and I live in a household that understands NOTHING about nutrition. I am a vegetarian, and once it was someone else\u2019s turn to make dinner so they presented me with a large plate of mashed potatoes as everything else was meat based. I don\u2019t mind making my own food, but don\u2019t always have the opportunity (9 people in the house makes accessing the kitchen a challenge sometimes).\n\nWithin 2 years I gained 47lbs. \n\nLate last year I started making exercise a priority again and was starting to feel a little more positive, but then early this year I had a trip to the optician which resulted in an emergency MRI (no brain tumor, thankfully), and a diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri. This is something that affects mainly overweight women of childbearing age. So, me. \n\nAlmost every visit to a doctor since then has included lecture about my weight. The ophthalmologist was very disappointed in me last time, and did the whole \u2018I can\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t work with me\u2019 thing, because I had gained a whole 1.5lbs since my previous visit. Given that I had lost 6lbs the visit before that, and I had been back from a 2 week vacation for three days, and had just started my period, I had thought I was doing fine - pretty much maintaining if I was accounting for period bloat. \n\nWell, that was the last day that I didn\u2019t freak out about everything I was eating and log every last calorie. I\u2019m down 10lbs in the past 3 months and trying desperately to maintain a healthy rate of weight loss, but now I get to enjoy mild panic attacks when the family goes out to eat. Meals made from scratch are a problem unless I weigh every ingredient first. I still eat crap, but then cry about it in the toilets afterwards, and ended up throwing up most of an ice cream sundae in the shower at the weekend.\n\nI was prescribed a medication a couple of months ago that made me crazy. As in, it was scaring the people around me, so at the advice of a pharmacist I stopped taking it. Now another medication has been suggested which has an almost identical list of side effects and my initial reaction was \u2018hell no\u2019, but then I noticed that it could cause weight loss and my attitude completely changed. My wife has said a very firm No on that one though, unless I actually develop symptoms that it could help with. Of course now part of me wants to start declaring that I\u2019m getting headaches just so that I can try that stuff. \n\nI\u2019m about to head to the gym on my lunch break now, so that no one can find me for our traditional taco Tuesday. The menus at our usual Mexican place don\u2019t have any nutritional information and dishes vary enough from week to week that I have to calculate it again every single time. \n\nI know where all of this is leading. I\u2019ve lived through it before, and the logical part of my brain is horrified, but the rest of me is absolutely convinced that it can\u2019t possibly be a problem as I am still overweight and my doctors don\u2019t think I am doing enough about it.", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

I've come to realize that I'm getting very complacent with my ED again. Not starving myself, but not challenging myself either. Not losing weight, but not restoring, yadda yadda. Complacency always backslides into relapse for me and I'm feeling the first signs of that (increased anxiety around food and body disatisfaction, exercising more, engaging in more fasting behaviours, being very crusty cause I'm hangry, etc). \nHow do you guys move from quasi into full recovery? I'm tempted to just go \"all in\" and try out the homeodynamic method, but I'm afraid that by increasing my calories, I'll \"poke the hunger dragon\" so to speak and it'll just rev up like crazy. I'm already recognizing that I haven't been feeling full or satisfied by my meals (been eating the same safe foods for ages), but I'm scared to eat to that satisfaction because what if that satisfaction doesnt come? But, on the flip side, I really want to eat and enjoy burgers, sandwiches, thai food etc with the rest of my friends. \nAlso, wanted to add that I'm starting group therapy again soon, and am going on vacation in 5 days to visit my dad and gma, where I'll have the access to loooooots of fresh local fruit, and to my gmas fabulous cooking, as well as time to get creative in the kitchen again.\n\nTl;dr: getting complacent in recovery and starting to relapse.

Earlier today, I went to a doctor for a general physical and mental check-up, and I have been referred for diagnoses that I didn't forsee. I'm not talking about diagnosis with BED as I already have that. \n\nI got referred for assessment for ADHD and Tourette's. The Tourette's I was reasonably sure I had, but the ADHD was COMPLETELY out of the blue. And... like, it would explain... so much. I feel weird. Obviously at this point it's not certain, but the doctor went through the symptoms and gave me some reading stuff for it and I relate to 90% of it.\n\nWhy is this significant? \n\nBecause 80% of people with ADHD get *addicted* to something. \n\nAnd that would explain not only how quickly and easily I fell into BED and self-harm addiction, but also why I need to avoid alcohol because every time I've had it (even one can of cider), I've spent the next month or so craving alcohol and know I would very easily get addicted if I gave in to that craving.\n\nObviously it's not the only factor in my BED and I'm not going to sit here and say \"Yes, I have BED because of my ADHD and there's nothing I can do about it because I have ADHD\". But if I DO have ADHD then it would certainly be a contributing factor to the addiction, and it may mean I need to take some extra steps in order to break the cycle, I'm not yet sure.\n\nAgain, this is a referral for assessment, not yet a diagnosis. I will definitely update you on what happens and whether or not I have it. But it makes a lot of sense (not just in terms of BED, in terms of like *everything*) and would definitely explain a lot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways. On to today. It has been hot as hell. There is ANOTHER heatwave coming through Europe right now after the last one and it is ***killing*** me. I grew up in a cold Northern place on the edge of the North Sea, I am **not** used to heat. I like cold and snow and rain, not that stupid big yellow ball in the sky, haha.  \nOn the bright side, the heat does help curb cravings as you're just too damn hot and tired to eat, hahaha.\n\nI am not looking forward to Thursday, though, as that's predicted to be the hottest day with no clouds or wind to cool us down \ud83d\ude13\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05.\n\nNot sure what to do with my exercise routine given the heat.

I began resource hoarding and binge eating. We would work 12 hour days and eat rationed meals. I constantly would think about food while preforming the monotonous tasks at hand. I began to control my binge habits by working hard on dinner for my coworkers. 10 hours a day I would think about creating recipes with the limited ingredients we were provided. Serving the meal, I found satisfaction in my crew enjoying my unique recipes. I found satisfaction in knowing all the details of my \"off the cuff\" recipes.. knowing every ingredient of the meal.. and just watching my coworkers eat it. \n\nIn a twisted scenario, I discovered my talent as a chef. Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. Food is my enemy, and I know it so intimately. \n\nI am currently the Head Gardener for an organic produce farm, the Manager of the local farmers market, founder for a local food co-op, and I am the Head Chef/Kitchen manager of a farm restaurant. Everything I am today is because of my twisted relationship with food. All this thought is falling on me today. I can't bear the thought that my passions are illegitimate, that is just my sick brain.  I can't help but understand my love for gardening as a long term way to control the food I am eating. From seed to stomach. I know all of it. I control it. I can't help but understand my love of sharing food and hosting dinner parties as a manipulation of the satisfaction center in my brain, to allow myself to starve. I can't see my passions without seeing the hate and fear and sickness. Do I truly care about spreading the good word of local foods and changing our food system or am I just concerned that processed foods will make me overweight?\n\nDoes anyone else find their career/passion in direct correlation with their ED?", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Was hospitalized and tubed for 2 months back then. From that point, I had significant periods of recovery (a couple months or years at a time) before relapsing. Relapses never got near as bad as the ED initially was; it would always be caught before things got completely out of control. Long story short, I have a history with ED shit. I have been at a healthy weight for a while now, the past few years. My sister is 18 and has never had ED problems as far as I know. She was always a healthy weight, exercised occasionally (reluctantly) and ate whatever she was in the mood for whenever she wanted. She was instrumental sometimes in my recovery, keeping me from purging or overexercising, talking to me about it. We have always been very close. We are on vacation together now (have been for the past week) and the first thing I noticed after not having seen her for half a year is that she has lost 15 to 20 pounds since I last saw her. It shocked me. I have been observing her habits over the past week and am disturbed by my findings. She exercises vigorously for at least an hour every morning (mostly cardio) and does not eat her first bite of food of the day until noon or 1 p.m. She\u2019s mostly vegan, rejecting animal products with a certain disgust. She has become rigidly dogmatic about cooking and diet and food preparation. She cooks dinner every night: all vegetables. Food is always the topic of conversation, mostly things she\u2019s \u201cin the mood for\u201d but won\u2019t eat. Like bagels, muffins. She whines every day after a meager dinner that leaves me still hungry about being too full and \u201cbloated\u201d. She\u2019s restricting. Her routine is inflexible. She is obsessing. I\u2019m officially worried about her. And I\u2019m also finding myself subconsciously competing with her. I\u2019m immersing myself in her ED schedule. My ED thoughts are flaring back up: I have to run faster and farther than her every morning, I have to eat less. If I don\u2019t exercise when she does, I\u2019m fat. If I eat when she doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m fat. She\u2019s always been the sane sister, and the fact that she clearly isn\u2019t right now is really bad. Now we\u2019re both spiraling. I feel like I owe her help. She once helped me \u2014 in this situation I might be able to do that for her?? I\u2019m just lost. I miss her full personality. I miss her soundness of mind. Now I see an anxious, gaunt young woman. And I want to be like her, in control. But I know that\u2019s not ok. So I guess I want ED to leave us both alone. I wonder why we are both afflicted.

This is a long post but I am desperate.\n\n\nIn the past, I've lost a bunch of weight and I started to eat healthy. I looked really good, and people were always giving me positive feedback. Some ppl suggested I should try modeling.\n\n\nHowever, my family didn't react well to this. They were calling me a bag of bones. One time, my sister did somthing hurtful to me and I went to my parents crying, and they were just laughing at me, telling me that I am a skeleton instead of addressing the problem.\n\n\nThey started to tear me apart, always telling me how horrible my body is, how ugly i am, how my legs look like two parenthesis. I was trying a pair of jeans on, and while I was in the changing room, I allowed my mother to take a look to see how they fit me. She blatantly told me that nothing fits me and she called my father. Both of them started to laugh at my body. I told them to get out, and they were like \"oh really?\" and they kept laughing. They eventually left, but I will never forget this image for the rest of my life.\n\n\nIn the end, I gave in, and I started to eat more and more. I was sick of being called \"disgusting\". I'm at a normal weight now, right in the middle of a healthy BMI, and I feel as if my parents are trying to make me fat. They're always buying me food, always asking me if I ate. They did not use to do this. They never did this. It doesn't even make sense because I'm basically chubby now.\n\nYesterday, I went to a restaurant with my dad, and I ate at Taco Bell. After finishing, on our way home, he literally asked me 5 times if I was hungry. I told him \"no\" each time, and he said \"you should eat now. what if you get hungry later\". This is not a random occurence, and it has happened before. He knows I never enjoyed juice. He bought me 3 different bottles of juice and he kept asking me \"All this JUICE IS FOR you. Do you want juice? Do you want it? Come on, at least drink just a little bit, to taste it\"\n\n\nThey always buy me sweets, always always always always, and when I deny eating them they keep asking me \"Why you dont want to eat them?? They re good! Are you sure u dont want to eat them???\" until I give in. \n\n\nOne night, I woke up with sour cherry pie and apple pie by my bedside, when I deliberately told them the day before that I did not want to eat any. They were bought from a bakery near my house. \n\n\nThe thing is that they're not eating anything from the food they're giving me. Only I get to eat the pie, the chocolate, the cake.\n\n\nWhen I finally eat, they laugh at me and they tell me \"Wow! You really ate everything?!? Haha! You really are a big eater. You'll eat my ears too one day. Biggie-eater.\" Those comments make me wanna stab my stomach and never eat again.\n\n\nThey're both overweight, not obese, and they did not use to act like this.  I feel as if they're trying to make me fat on purpose. I feel stuck. Are they really trying to make me fat or am I overreacting? I feel as if I can't trust my own family. Don't even try suggesting to communicate with them: if I tell them that something about them upsets me, they act as if it is my fault and I am a bad daughter.\n\n\nWhat should I do?

I usually ate around 1200 kcal per day and then ended up binging every few days, so I was a bad restricter.\n\nSo I upped my calories and hoped, that eating around 1500 kcal per day will make me want to binge less, and so far, that has worked for me. I weighed myself on Tuesday morning to see if eating more calories would make me gain weight or if I could maintain it. I weighed 53,3 kg and wanted to either lose a tiny bit more weight or to maintain it. So I began having a little exercise daily (I have uni holidays so I don't really leave the house too much) and rode my bike for 30 minutes a day or went for a walk or went swimming.\n\nI weighed myself today again to see if my calories are fine the way they are, but the scale said I know weigh 53,7 kg.\n\nNow, my brain knows that this has to be waterweight.

I just wish I could stop caring about the numbers on the scale, because I **feel great** but I have been obsessed with my weight since forever.\n\nI just push my doubts aside and keep eating my 1500 kcal and then I will weigh myself again in a few days and if the number keeps going up, only *then* will I change anything in my diet again.

Sorry.\n\nI feel I should start with a little bit of background. I was diagnosed with AN last year after years of a weird-ass relationship with food and my body mass. I never viewed it as bad enough to actually address it, so I let it carry on until I didn't really have a choice.\n\nI would gain and lose the same weight and then at some point I stopped gaining it back. There wasn't much method to it, but I was restricting and losing weight and was pretty okay about it. I wasn't underweight at that point, but I was losing enough for people to notice. People that knew how weird my actual eating was were worried, others thought it was a good thing.\n\nIt got worse around the end of 2017. On reflection, I shouldn't be surprised that there was/is a negative correlation between food-related bullshit and my mood and mental health. Anyway, I was admitted to hospital in March last year because of (apparently not) unrelated mental health stuff. I'd hope that nobody particularly thrives in a psychiatric ward, but it's safe to say I did far from that. I found it very difficult and was a little (a lot) overwhelmed with the situation and environment I was in. I was a pretty far way out of my comfort zone and, for some reason, part of that translated into not being able to enter the dining room. That meant I didn't eat any of the meals. My mum would bring in 'Picnics' every couple of days but my blood sugar got very low and they had to monitor it a lot and they prescribed supplements and threatened to take me to General and said I might have to be transferred to somewhere specialised which, at the time, sounded completely fucking ridiculous.\n\nLong story short - stayed for a couple of weeks. Got discharged. 'We'll have to refer you to the eating disorder team'. Didn't. Job done, flown straight under that radar - nice one redditaccountforthat.\n\nI\u2019m not really sure what happened after. I got stuck in a cycle of restricting and binging and I gained some weight back.\n\nA couple of months later, my MH nurse made an observation that I displayed a lot of autistic traits. I was encouraged to seek an assessment, and somewhat reluctantly did, with the hope that we could rule it out as a reason why I found it so hard to exist on this weird mostly spherical ball of shit. Another long story short, turns out I\u2019m autistic \u2013 which goes some way to explain the difficulties I\u2019ve had. I found the diagnostic process quite difficult. Lots of talking and questions and weird activities that make no sense. It was hard, but receiving a diagnosis affected me far more than it should have.\n\nI was led to believe that finding out if I was autistic would be a good thing, that maybe it would lead to a little bit of self-discovery and a little bit of an explanation to many things in my life. Instead, it overwhelmed me. I\u2019m closer to acceptance than I was before, but it really knocked my sense of self. Confirming it felt like confirming all the thoughts I\u2019ve had about not truly belonging here. If I was autistic, surely that meant I would never and could never belong here. It was a lot, and my mental health and ED behaviours took over from there. \n\nLast winter, things got worse again. They were worse than the year before and apparently justified an urgent referral to the eating disorder team. With denial being what it is, I again thought that was completely fucking ridiculous.\n\nI was under the high-risk team for a bit, and trying really hard to do what they asked of me, but the weight kept coming off. I was burning more than I eating and I just couldn\u2019t stop losing. It was just disappearing. Early on they said they didn\u2019t want to put a label on it, and I was thankful for that \u2013 I\u2019d had enough labeling for one year, but next thing I know I\u2019m told that I have anorexia.\n\nMy weight got lower and I was told that if I didn\u2019t agree to day treatment, that a bed would be found for me whether I agreed or not. I didn\u2019t fancy being in a hospital or being sectioned, so I agreed.\n\nI went to day treatment. I weight restored. I left as soon as I was healthy enough to do so. I discharged myself from the service.\n\nI was told I would have to visit my GP regularly for weigh-ins and blood tests. I did not do that, because I\u2019m a fucking idiot.\n\nFor a while, I kept up the meal plan I was supposed to. I realised that there was no longer anybody to really stop me if I didn\u2019t follow it, so I started to go back to my old eating habits. I wouldn\u2019t eat all day; I\u2019d have dinner and then I would often end up (probably subjectively) binging at night.\n\nMy weight stayed mostly the same. I\u2019d have good and bad weeks. I never really addressed the thought process, so being in my weight restored body is really hard. \n\nEvery day, I would say \u2018today\u2019s the day, I need to start losing this weight\u2019 and I would restrict and most of the time end up ruining it by eating too much.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I stopped ruining it. I successfully restricted, and so it was easier to do the next day, and then the next. The rules about timing and exercise and numbers all came back and now I\u2019m here, with an empty stomach and a friction burn on the base of my spine.\n\nI\u2019m not really sure what relapse looks like, but I think this might be it, and I think I\u2019m glad. As disgusting and fucking ridiculous as it is, I\u2019m glad and I can\u2019t explain why. Being unwell was exhausting and so fucking time consuming, but part of me misses having my head filled with numbers and rules rather than thoughts about my existence. Part of me misses not being able to feel anything. I felt so bad physically that I didn\u2019t get a chance to think about how I felt mentally. I know that I wasn\u2019t in control, but the false sense of it felt better than feeling like I do now \u2013 not knowing what the fuck is going on.\n\nIn treatment, people spoke a lot about the person you were before the disorder. I wasn\u2019t really a person. Well, I was a shit one. I didn\u2019t lose my friends because of the eating disorder; I didn\u2019t really have any to start with. I didn\u2019t stop going out, because I didn\u2019t start going out in the first place. I didn\u2019t lose anything other than the feelings and the thoughts that told me I shouldn\u2019t be here. My eating disorder has been a distraction from that, and a really unhelpfully effective one. \n\nIt\u2019s shit, and it was fucking killing me but I figured if it was anorexia that killed me, my family would have something to blame other than themselves. I always struggled to separate it from my self because I always thought that a disorder couldn\u2019t make conscious decisions \u2013 only I could. I couldn\u2019t understand why people were encouraged to see it as a whole other person, but I was glad they did, because maybe that meant I wasn\u2019t responsible \u2013 even though I know full well that I was and that I am.\n\nI did this. I let it happen and I\u2019m so fucking angry that I did because now I look back and think that it\u2019s the only way I can exist and I know how fucking stupid that is. I know that it only leads to bad things. \n\nI keep thinking that if I just lose the weight and just stop this time, it\u2019ll be fine. Losing weight was the simple part, I just never learned how to stop and I\u2019m scared that I won\u2019t be able to stop.\n\nI\u2019m supposed to be going to uni in a few months. I\u2019m 2 years late but I\u2019m supposed to move away and be responsible for myself. I\u2019m supposed to be responsible for food and I\u2019m scared that I\u2019ll lose control again. I\u2019m scared that I won\u2019t be able to stop, but I\u2019m too scared to tell anyone. I don\u2019t want them to worry or care or do anything. I just want to lose the weight and then maintain. I have to fix it, but I know that that\u2019s exactly what I said last time and that\u2019s exactly what didn\u2019t happen.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know how to stop this. I don\u2019t want to stop. I want to keep moving and restricting and counting and checking and I feel so stupid for it. I don\u2019t know what kind of person that makes me, but I\u2019m not sure I want to find out and fuckity fuck fuck what kind of twisted fucking person wants this? Why do I want this? How do I stop wanting to go back to how things were before treatment? Why do I want that? What the fuck is wrong with me?\n\nI have to fix it and I know how I\u2019m just scared to commit in case I can\u2019t stop. I have to stop, just not right now. Not yet. Fuck. I just feel so fucking confused and conflicted and scared and angry and I know how to stop that but I just, I have to go to uni. I can\u2019t get bad again. I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to.\n\nI just feel stuck I guess, between two bad things. \n\nI don\u2019t know.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

This clinic treats every disorder regardless of weight, BMI and clinical conditions, with an urgency towards heavily underweight and/or malnourished people of course, but no one is left behind. So, the clinic is good and I'm actually willing to get help, but my parents aren't supportive (they are, in fact, my biggest trigger), and this centre is pretty expensive.

Went from binge eating, to bulimia, to anorexia and so on) for as long as I can remember. About half a year ago I moved out of my parents' house and I recently started working with a bike (I deliver food), so as a result of these things I'm currently just shy of underweight but still have fat on me. I'd say I'd been so worried about not having enough food that my eating disorder simply had no place to be.\n\nRecently though, it's making a comeback. I have a boyfriend, we've been together for a year and a half. He half-lives with me. When I knew him, he was thin but also very muscular. He got chubby since he's been with me (I cook as a way of expressing love), and I've noticed he's insecure about it. I've tried being supportive (without making comments on his weight) by making healthier meals and working out with him. This has triggered old habits back. Plus, he's gotten into the habit of pointing out when I gain a bit of weight, which I've told him I don't like. \n\nHe doesn't know I'm still ill. I told him I used to have an eating disorder, but lied and said I was over it and looking to be healthier now. I believe he thinks he's helping me when he points out I've gained weight (he's not rude about it -- just too matter-of-factly). Really, all he's doing is making me miserable and triggering an awful relapse. I feel awful and can't stand eating again. \n\nMy question is, I've told him before I don't like comments about my weight. I believe I might need to be clearer, to tell him I don't like it because I'm still ill and it sends me back into a relapse. Is this okay? Or is he being unnecessarily cruel? I don't know if it's something I can excuse. How can I tell if it's worth keeping this relationship up? And how do I talk to him about still being ill?\n\nI love him and for the most part, I'm happy with him. But this is destroying my confidence in him and myself. It doesn't happen often at all and he isn't too rude about it, but it still feels dismissive. After telling him I'm ill and asking for support in recovery (I will do this tomorrow), how do I know if it's worth it after that? At what point should I realize he's not respecting this? Should I cut him some slack or am I right in being so upset?\n\nThank you for reading.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

I force myself to wait as long as I can (without dropping my blood sugar really far or until I can't stand the hunger anymore) between meals. It rarely goes beyond 24 hours, but I do what I can. When I do eat, I force myself to eat less than I normally do and try to pick out healthy foods only.

I stash snacks in my room so I don't have to eat in front of them.

I have been in an out of treatment for the past 3 years and it has basically been a constant relapse/treatment cycle. I recently left treatment (3 months ago) and I have lost all of the weight I had gained in treatment and then some; I am now severely underweight - objectively, although it does not feel that I am there is some rational part of my brain screaming \"you are very sick.\" I know that I need to go back to the hospital and it is inevitable that I will; however, I am not yet ready (I am working on this). I do not B/P or take any sort of dietetics/laxatives/etc... I do not work out aside from a 20-ish minute walk to and from work and my job is not strenuous. I have read that hand swelling can be caused by an increase in calories (which is not the case), as well as laxative/diuretic withdrawal (which is also not the case).\n\nIn the meantime, my main concern right now is water retention and what my body is trying to tell me (other than the obvious \"have a fuckin' calorie\" stuff). I have never had this before and it has become concerning insofar as my fingers are numb and my feet are as well. They are so swollen and I don't know if it is just a salt/dehydration thing or if it is a more serious situation that needs immediate medical attention. They have been swollen for about a week now, but today they have gotten much worse and I am feeling very weak; I am having a hard time moving around and lifting things like my phone, my muscles kind of burn/just give out? If that makes sense.\n\nI hope this has not been triggering for anyone and I apologize if it has come across that way.\n\nTLDR; my hands are swollen and numb and I have been restricting.

This is the fourth time treatment has changed the conditions surrounding my admission, none of which has been written down, and even my care team here is angry. I've been following their instructions by attending AA meetings and reducing my alcohol intake, but now all my efforts appear to have been for nothing. I find it hard enough to even admit I want/need recovery, and now to have to fight for my right to treatment feels like absolute bullshit. The thought of going to rehab freaks me out, and it doesn't help that my mom thinks I don't belong there. Should I start looking at alternative treatment options? Has anyone experienced a similar situation, preferably in Canada? Any tips/resources for dealing with a concurrent disorder such as AN and alcoholism?", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

The therapist said, if you are a normal, healthy human, you eat when you're hungry and you stop when you're full. Guess, it didn't work out, sure thing, because of my BES.\n\nBut now, do you think I have a chance right now? To get away the blockades that terminates my goals? Or do you think it's dangerous?

She also asks me how it tastes, what I'm thinking while eating it, and things that come up related to my eating disorder. It feels really awkward initially, but it's encouraging that my therapist will basically eat anything I choose without having to change her day or other food around to accommodate it (like I normally would).\n\n  I have done one food exposure with her already, which I found helpful. It certainly wasn't easy, but it was comforting to have her eat something normal with me and she let me pick what I wanted too.

I feel like I get stuck in a rut with my snacks and I can't come up with ideas for new things to eat.

I've never liked heat; I grew up in a cold, Northern town along the North Sea. Cold winds, rain all-year round, snow on the cliffs in winter.\n\nSo heat and me are not exactly friends. And right now Europe is going through a huge damn HEATWAVE. Today the temperature was around 36^(o)C (96-97F) and it's set to get even hotter tomorrow, possibly going into the 40s (104F and higher). Depending on where you live this may not sound much, but keep in mind that I'm used to summer temperatures of 17-20C (about 65F).\n\nOn the one hand, the heat does help with cravings as it drastically reduces my general appetite. On the other hand, my exercise routine is totally screwed; it's much harder to get any exercise done in this heat, which makes me feel worse because I feel like I'm not accomplishing as much in terms of my workouts. (Which rationally I know is dumb, but this isn't Rational Me speaking).\n\nOn top of that my family is talking about having a BBQ soon...which is going to be difficult to stick to a calorie limit with, given that generally one burger alone is about 3/4 of my daily calorie allowance. I'm thinking of getting vegetarian burgers to try and combat this.\n\nAlso, I said earlier this week that because I binged on Sunday, I'd wait till Tuesday before weighing in so that the binge didn't affect it. However, it is now Wednesday and I am not weighing in this week. Not because I'm not working to lose weight; because I'm on my ... \\*cough\\* time of the month \\*cough\\* , which always causes me to gain a few pounds. I know that if I weighed myself now, it would not be accurate and it would just make me feel bad because it would LOOK like I'd gained weight.\n\nSo there probably won't be another weigh-in till next Monday.

I started running on a whim to deal with the stress and really loved it. It wasn\u2019t excessive at all, and I kept running regularly (3-4 times per week) for the next several years. Even up to last year, I think I still had a healthy relationship with running, even as I was able to build up my mileage. I was running about 20 miles per week last year, sometimes more, and it was all good. \n\nUntil I got laid off, and found myself with more time to exercise, even when I started a new part time job a few weeks later.

I just wanna be able to run injury free but also restrict. Currently eating 800 to 1000 calories a day, but curious if anyone has been able to keep running/exercising at a fairly high level while low restricting? \n\nMy calorie levels feel so high to me esp when I see other posters eating way less but I feel like I need some fuel to be able to run. \ud83d\ude14", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I have visited my GP and I have been lying to her about my weight. I don't trust her and find her very confrontational so was always worried when I dropped a little weight. I have been going every two weeks to get weighed but I am struggling and things are getting worse than ever. She has given me the option of a referral but not given me any more information about what that really entails and I am stressing out over it. All I know is that it is a psychiatry appointment.\n\nI was curious as to others experiences with the NHS and what this referral means and options? Not sure where to go from here and I don't feel I can trust my family or anyone else with this.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

Im not a certified anything. I have not fully recovered yet from BED. I use to binge everyday. Now its every other day or less than that. And my binges have gotten smaller. Much smaller. I use to eat to the point where i couldnt move. Now its just slightly past fullness. And im not binging on absolute junk food anymore. It use to be tater tots and ice cream and that kind of stuff. Now the worst ive binged on lately has been medjool dates and peanut butter and bread. To me thats an improvement and im proud of myself. Im still working on it. Here are things that have worked for me:\n- get out of the house. Not like get out and go to a restaurant. Go somewhere where theres no food. \n- driving. This kind of goes with the last tip but go for a drive. I know this can be costly but for me its therapeutic. I blast my favorite songs and sing along. It clears my mind, makes me happy, and takes my mind off food. \n- meticulous foods. Lately ive been eating cherries which forces me to eat slower or else ill choke. This could probably work with seeds seeds with shells. Also lettuce wraps. Ill make some rice and beans and lay out some lettuce and ill put it together. It makes me eat slower and pay more attention to my food.  Also no processed foods. Make it from scratch. While making it you have more time to think if you really want to eat that much. \n- sparkling water/essence water. I was watching weight management psychology with glenn mackintosh on youtube and he mentioned it. It gives sort of the sensation of eating or at least something more than drinking water. When i want to eat but not hungry i drink it. If im watching tv and want to eat because im bored ill drink it. I also recommend his videos. He has some really good videos on BED. \n- the thought \u201ci want to eat this but im not hungry\u201d. This has helped me a lot. Ill pick up a bag if chips and its become an automatic thought at this point. Its taken me a few weeks for it to become an automatic thought anytime i pick up food. I now always ask myself \u201cam i actually hungry though?\u201d  Intuitive eating. Really concentrate on your stomach. When you want to binge remember the feeling of how much it hurt to stuff yourself with food the last time you binged. Or how it made you feel. It took me a lot of time to make this a habit\n \nHope this helps :)", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

It was a rocky start and we called it FWB. He was really hesitant at first to say anything more than friends (maybe once I told him I liked him and it turned into \u201cI think I\u2019m giving you the wrong impression\u201d) because our relationship ended REALLY badly. Basically the break up happened on his terms early last year because we were really codependent, depressed, and used substances to cope. He eventually dipped and it caused me to spiral and then a later in the year sucide attempt and then a later BP2 diagnosis while in inpatient. Basically I was a mess. One of the lowest times of my life but I don\u2019t put the blame on him. We\u2019ve reconciled and said our sorrys for what we did to each other.\n\nFast forward to March and we were at a mutual friend\u2019s house (both of us drinking but we hadn\u2019t spoken since he saw me around the time of the attempt) and I could tell he wanted to talk to me by his mannerisms. I eventually leave and go home and I get a text from him asking if I\u2019m up and long story short he tells me that of course he wanted to talk to me because \u201cit\u2019s you. It\u2019s always been you!\u201d He was drunk so it was stupid but it\u2019s been in my head since. That\u2019s how we slowly started hanging out again. In the beginning he would flake or just make lame excuses as to why he couldn\u2019t hang out last min. My friend said he was probably still afraid from how the break up went but idk. This slowly stopped and we started regularly hanging out a lot.\n\nIt\u2019s been 4 months now and in the beginning we said mostly sex and we are friends. Even though that first night we talked I told him that I have feelings for him. So during these past months he knows how I feel.\n\nBut now we are basically a couple with out saying it. About 2 months ago he said he isn\u2019t ready for a relationship or even liking anyone like that?? But like I said he sleeps over multiple nights a week, we go on dates, watch movies, I *try* to plan to make meals together. and he has been there through my other ED bs. Other little things like kissing me when he randomly wakes up at night, or most recently calling me babe or baby. I know that\u2019s small but just the way we talk feels different He was really weird about holding hands but now we do that more. He was also weird about kissing in front of my friends because he thought they hated him for the break up but I\u2019ve been trying to explain that they are just protective and most of them are over it but still care about my wellbeing like most friends would. \n\n\nSoooo the point of this whole thing is that I wanna ask him what the hell are we doing without freaking him out. I\u2019m \u201cok\u201d with not being formal gf/bf but it would be nice to have a straight answer when people ask if we are together or not. Most importantly I wanna know if he has any feelings or truely sees me as just 100% as a friend. I\u2019m just really scared he will say that he\u2019s giving me the wrong impression and that things should change and I don\u2019t want that to happen because it\u2019s perfect right now I feel so happy with him I just want to know how he\u2019s feeling. \n\nI really like this guy basically never stopped and I\u2019m confused and don\u2019t wanna fuck it up :-/\n\nI could also be an idiot and reading into a dumb pet name as a sign that a guy has feelings for you. I just would like to think after all this time and stuff we\u2019ve been through together and we are back here now there has to be something left?", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Lots of progress on my self hate but also lots of emotional eating. Hello nearing my previous HW. I've been hoping/fearing a restrictive relapse for a while. It's been status quo but I've both hoping to get better and to get worse in only the romantic restrictive way of my choice (can I get an amen?) \n\nWith this occupying way to much of my headspace, I ended up drunkenly confessing aaaaaaall my sins to my best-friend-cum-older-sister bestie. This was a terrible idea. Not only is she completely out of her depth when it comes to mental illness, she's also the type to aggressively hound you into doing things the \"right way\" aka professional channels. While she 100% means well I'm not in the financial or mental place for therapy (and my self insured brethren know how hard finding an ED therapy or nutritional specialist that takes insurance is). I'm very worried that her pushiness will wreck my until-now best friendship ever. \n\nAND THEN I had to confess to my husband about my done-fucked-up mistake. And while on one hand he's a magical unicorn that understands and supports me and only wants me to be healthy, he also deals with his own dysfunctional relationship with food, and his own complicated feelings about being at a healthy weight for the first time ever. So these conversations have a 50% chance of turning into a trigger each other fest. \n\nLuckily this time it did not become trigger fest and he suggested that if she gets to pushy to just lie. He doesn't really care about anything else as long as I'm honest with him. \n\nBut still it's been a rollercoaster week and I still haven't successfully restricted. I'm not sure if I'm looking for advice or screaming into the void. \n\nCan I get an amen?\n\n(I'm going to bed after typing this up you lovely individuals of all sorts, so I'll reply on the morning and you are all beautiful/handsome creatures.

Then this week I see her post a 'finally reached my GW' and she looks super skinny and I found myself bitterly browsing her pictures every day and I decided it was healthier for my mind to just not see them at all.\n\n2. Today, for the first time in my life, I decided to wear a dress without hiding my legs with tights or leggings. I have always hated my legs. I am pale, I don't tan well, I don't want to use a sunbed and fake tan just looks fake on me. My legs are also flabby. But my country is in the middle of a heatwave, and my legs would be hidden under the desk at work anyway. They're also a little veiny and there's a bump or two (I will always remember my mum pointing the bump out and saying, that looks like a varicose vein. Only really obese people get those!).

Dr. Cynthia Bulik, a clynical psychologist at UNC who has co-authored the study, has discussed the findings in a recent podcast with ED-recovery advocate Tabitha Farrar: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA7ZrzKxbFs\n\nThe study is particularly relevant for me. I have never really bought into the view of EDs - and especially Anorexia - as strategies to cope with feelings of worthlessness, or media-influenced \"women diseases\" caused by the desire to get skinny, or ways to get attention from unloving parents, or whatever other ready-made stuff psychoanalists have used over the decades to make sense of it. I have always believed that there must be something more \"biological\" in all of that, and research seems to be going in that direction.

For those that didn\u2019t, yesterday I denied mental hunger for hours and then when I tried to eat, I panicked. Didn\u2019t eat and ended up crying because of this ridiculous fear of food/weight gain. Today I was determined to not let my ED win. \n\nI had unmeasured cereal for bfast along with protein shake in coffee at 7 am. That kept me full until 10:20 am when I started to get hungry. I normally don\u2019t eat lunch until 11 am so I was angry. Went to the food court at my uni and saw a place that has liege waffles with Nutella. Texted BF. He told me to get it. Instantly started panicking. Then realized I didn\u2019t have my card on me, it was in my car. He told to to walk to my car, get card, and then go back and get waffle. It took some courage (and I\u2019m no Gryffindor), but I decided I would do it.\n\nWhen I go to the food court and ordered, I got my order slip. It was number 11. I am obsessed more or less with the number 11. I took a pic and sent it to my BF with no words. He realized what I was showing him and texted \u201c#11 meant to be.\u201d Seeing 11 weirdly gave me courage.\n\nThen I get my waffle handed to me in a box. I walk over to a table by the window. This place is notorious for writing little sayings on their boxes. Like, \u201cDream Big\u201d or \u201cMake Today Count.\u201d When I sat down I saw what mine said, \u201cKeep Calm.\u201d I wanted to start crying and tbh I\u2019m tearing up writing this. I sent that picture to my BF too. And then I took a bite and it was glorious! Almost as good as what I had in Belgium. I ate the entire thing. And I wasn\u2019t panicky at all while eating. I\u2019m a little scared right now. But nothing I can\u2019t handle. Small steps friends. We can do this, but we have to actually try and actually DO things, not just think about doing them.\n\nAlso, my BF is amazing and this entire story wouldn\u2019t have even happened if he didn\u2019t encourage me to get the waffle.

Anyway, another thing that causes these panic attacks is because after over 20 years my parents really don't understand (though they try, I am sure) anything pertaining to my mental health. They rush me through the trips. As I sit and read everything on the labels and need to look at everything I can even if I have a list, or I am in binge mode, and need to plan the most perfect binge, my parents rush me. They do their shopping so fast and I WISH I could do this, but it takes at least 3 hours to make it through the stores we go to combined. It really causes me to go into huge fits of panic the moment my mind is disrupted from how I need to do my thing.\n\nThis is just a post to look back on, and say, even if there were only 20 items I had on my list and it took 2.5 hours to make it through, I did not panic and I am home and safe and feeling better.

I have always believed that there must be something more \"biological\" in all of that, and research seems to be going in that direction.

I just started therapy with a new therapist (I\u2019ve only been to 2 sessions so far), and I honestly did not expect to focus too much on my issues with food/body image. However, due to family history, she asked a few specific, probing questions about my relationship to food and body image, and I felt compelled to answer honestly (trying to get my shit together and be a well-adjusted adult, here). Those answers had her saying \u201ceating disorder\u201d already, and she had me write out a detailed history of my relationship to food and my body/body image for homework.\n\nIt was difficult to write, but I got through it - I guess I\u2019ve always *known* I had an eating disorder, so it wasn\u2019t necessarily hard to admit those things to myself. The reading it out loud in the next session, though... oh boy. Because I\u2019ve never been underweight, I\u2019ve been able to make it till now without ever having to talk about that stuff. No one\u2019s really ever taken too much notice and asked. So we kicked things off with a nice little tearful anxiety attack. After that, due to my therapist checking in with my anxiety and asking clarifying questions and reassuring me, etc., I was only able to get through about 1/4 of the written history. Even still, my therapist was using the terms \u201ceating disorder\u201d and \u201csevere body dysmorphia\u201d by the end of the session. There\u2019s many more daunting sessions ahead of me working through the rest of the history, and then tackling out the ED and dysmorphia themselves. (Luckily, she specializes in EDs as well as the other things I actually came to therapy for initially.)\n\nSince starting therapy, and since that last session in particular, I have been feeling so raw, so sad, and so emotionally... beat-up. Like I\u2019ve been hit by a truck. It\u2019s not great. Actually hearing from a professional that this is a serious issue is a lot to process, even if I guess I always knew it was. I\u2019ve been devolving more and more into disordered eating since we started to address this - \u201cforgetting\u201d to eat, scheduling my days so packed that I can say I just don\u2019t have time to eat, \u201cenjoying\u201d my hunger, not having an appetite, and feeling the urge to purge when I do finally eat to a normal/\u201ccomfortable\u201d level of fullness (although I am trying really, really hard not to go back down that road). I know if I were to analyze this, it\u2019s my ED digging its nails and desperately trying keep control as my therapist and I prepare to metaphorically yank it out &amp; get my own control back. I also think it\u2019s possible simply thinking about/writing about/talking about my past (more trapped by the ED) self is triggering my current self. But I *have* to talk about triggering things in order to heal!\n\nHas anyone else experienced this with therapy? How can I stay safe while actively working to get healthy with my therapist? It\u2019s all so new to actually talk about this that as fearful as I am digging up the past with her, I\u2019m a million times more afraid of talking about the present. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to tell her how triggered and \u201cbad\u201d I\u2019m feeling just yet. I\u2019m afraid my ED is going to fully take over throughout this process and prevent me from healing... and I\u2019m afraid of the part of me that wants that more than I want to heal.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

So many feels omg", "author": "Reapermanee", "self_text": "Cannot believe I'm even saying this or that this is reality, but today marks my one year anniversary of entering residential treatment/taking treatment seriously. The following post I wrote today after seeing my FB memory of telling people I was getting help, and I wanted to share it here as well. Note that I've made some slight edits to it for this Reddit post (left out resources since this sub already has several and referring to old friends I have on my FB) but everything else is included (: \n\n\"A year ago today, I went to residential treatment for my anorexia nervosa. This day brings so many emotions to mind. Sadness that the disorder got so out of hand. Anger that I'd wasted years of my life to it because all I could think about were calories and my weight. Most of all, though, I feel proud. For months, I fought going to get the help I truly needed. There was a lot of downplaying just how bad it was; I didn't post too many pictures of myself mid-2017 to mid-2018 so nobody could see my body breaking down, my dad was just about the only person I confided in about some problems but I still tried to say \"but it's totally cool, I'm totally fine\", and I stopped talking to all of my friends because I thought that if the disorder killed me it wouldn't affect anyone negatively &amp; nobody would care - in fact, they'd celebrate it. \n\nBut I was literally committing slow suicide, and it was painful. My body hurt and bruised even at the slightest bump against something. There wasn't any energy in me to do anything but smoke weed and sleep on my couch all day. My heart and vitals started to get affected. Some days, I barely had enough energy to lift my eyelids or get off the couch. Every day, there was a voice of reason inside of me that would scream at me to stop, but I was so obsessed that I kept pushing it out and listening to the ED voice. \n\nAlthough I was pissed and scared when I was driving to rehab, I do not regret committing to going and working the program. If it weren't for my treatment team, I'm not sure I'd even be here right now. So much of my success I owe to them - though I know I've also put in hard work myself. Learning to cook and eat again was difficult, it physically and mentally pained me to keep going, but it was necessary. During the couse of my month in res &amp; my several months of PHP/IOP, I realized just how much I've been playing Russian Roulette with my life, and that I was sick and tired of trying to starve myself to death every other year. \n\nEvery day, I am faced with another challenge, and the cruel voice is still there, but I am doing so much better at not giving into it. Some days eating really hurts my stomach and makes me cry and scream, but other days meal and snack time is something I almost look forward to. It's been ~5-6 years since I truly took sincere enjoyment in eating, and two years since I've allowed myself to have a proper meal and snack. \n\nI didn't realize how much I missed enjoying eating. I didn't realize how much energy my body had been missing until I started eating. Living with a body and brain that aren't starved has given me some mental clarity and I can now give my full attention to people I'm talking to/I can keep a conversation going. Today, I'm in a bathing suit, which is something I haven't worn in years. Although I'm nervous to go out in public, I am doing it, and that's what truly matters. \n\nI'm glad to still be alive with everyone \ud83d\udc9e Living my life is so much more enriching than striving for death.

I\u2019m 24, and finally decided to go to my doctor for help losing weight this past December. She prescribed my phentermine and I\u2019ve been on it since, while taking some breaks here and there. I\u2019ve lost about 70 pounds and would like to lose about 40 more. \n\nNow I\u2019m scared I\u2019ve gotten myself into an unhealthy cycle of binging and fasting. When I binge, it\u2019s literally anything I can get my hands on. The amount of food I consume during my binged have decreased, however it still feels like the same uncontrollable feeling. Immediately after I get an urge to make up for it. So I fast for however long I can last until my next binge. My fasting days consist of a crap ton of caffeine and protein shakes, typically two a day mixed with espresso. When I\u2019m not eating solid food, I\u2019m able to see my weight loss. I feel skinny, and I get obsessed with that feeling because I\u2019ve never been able to achieve it any other way. Any kind of compliment I receive on my weight loss or how I look just adds fuel to my desire to not eat. I start to fear food. I get uncomfortable around it, and I struggle so much while preparing food for my family. I\u2019m scared that taking even a single bite of something will result in a binge. The minute I eat any kind of solid food in any amount, that feeling goes away completely and my reflection goes back in time six months to the body I had before. I feel fat again. I feel disgusted with myself again. And I binge again. This cycle has been repeating itself for months. My last binge escalated to the point of taking a laxative immediately after to attempt to lessen the damage I had done. Part of me is worried that I\u2019ve developed an eating disorder of some sort, and part of me argues that I\u2019m just a fatass and even if I have, it\u2019s not like it could hurt anything. Part of me wants to seek out a therapist to talk to, and part of me is terrified that if I do that I\u2019ll have to stop taking the phentermine and I\u2019ll undo all of my progress and gain it all back. I\u2019ve tried so hard to wrap my head around all of this myself, because I\u2019m scared to tell anyone, but I just can\u2019t comprehend it all. How do I begin to figure out what this is, besides going to a therapist? Every time I\u2019ve wanted to talk to someone about it, I convince myself that I\u2019m just being over dramatic and that it will come off as attention seeking. But it\u2019s only escalating and it seems like it\u2019s starting to affect everything I think and do. My entire days are spent with obsessive thoughts about either how badly I want to binge, or fighting off hunger and convincing myself every minute of the day to not give in and eat. I\u2019m so exhausted mentally.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

For me it was the same, but add being unbelievably horny into the mix, and I felt like there was no way I could get out of it. I couldn't stop myself - imagine if the sexiest thing you can imagine is ordering 6 burgers from a fast food place and eating every single one of them in one go, and you had my nightmare. I didn't want it, I fucking HATED it, but as soon as I got turned on every single diet plan went out the window as I sought out release.\n\nSo this eventually ends up with me gaining 150 pounds on top of my original 120lb starting weight. I was fucking miserable. I was self harming every day and when i wasn't doing that i was intentionally putting myself into danger. I just didn't give a single fuck about life. I kept filling that void with food and I'd keep losing control because I'd get turned on by how much I was eating. I'm not ashamed to admit I spent a lot of nights sobbing about feeling so stupid, so animalistic, so unable to control myself. \n\nSo that's really what hit me one day, is the control aspect. I definitely had an eating disorder before, but it switched gears. I threw out every single bit of food I had in my apartment. Every single bit. I went out and only bought food I didn't associate with weight gain or fatness. Unhealthy food had become a turn on so my idea was to be \"celibate\". I didn't get any sexual thrill from eating a bowl of broccoli like I did a cheeseburger but I was finally taking control of my life. \n\nBut now it's just spiraled out of control and I've lost all the weight I gained and then some. My skin is saggy, I feel exhausted all the time, my teeth are loose, I have almost a bald spot in my hair, and now I can't stop losing weight because I feel like if I gain weight, I'll get turned on by it and it'll turn into a cycle I won't be able to stop again. Either way, fat or skinny, I'm dying but at least now I'm closer to how my body used to be. At least im not fat anymore. \n\nI am simultaneously petrified and excited by gaining weight/being fat even though I KNOW how much I hated it, my animal brain is just fucked up and wants what it wants. So here I am, living basically the most joyless sexually unfulfilling life I've ever lead. But I don't want to live like I did, and I don't know how to find a medium.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Instantly I had phone out, googling her weight in kilograms, checking against her \"worst\" her stats to make sure I was thinner.\n\nI know this stuff might help provide shock value to the majority of readers but anorexia is a numbers game to a lot of people.

I apologize for even having the write this as I feel terrible. \n\nI have struggled on and off for close to 8 years with my eating tendencies. I have highs and lows.

We have been together for almost 3 years. Now I hid it from him for a very long time but my last relapse was the worst it ever was. He helped me through it. He was patient, he was supportive, anything I could ask for and truly it helped me be okay with helping myself and become okay with a few pounds. Now I am not the heaviest I have been but I am still struggling. I have hid it from him, however he knows I am extremely uncomfortable with my body as I am very open about those sort of things especially when it comes to going to the beach or even something as small as getting changed with him in the room, this might be tmi but i have avoided sex and all types of it for a little bit now so I think he knows something is up with me. Like I said, he is patient and supportive. \n\nI also said I haven\u2019t told him I\u2019m on my way downhill. I have been trying to just keep a grip on it not wanting to worry him or anyone else. Unfortunately he has stopped eating unless I am with him. I don\u2019t have the time to be with him 24/7 due to family activities, work, and just trying to spread my time evenly between taking care of myself, him, and my family. He says he isn\u2019t hungry, he says he doesn\u2019t feel good. He comments on his weight a lot, forgets to eat. He does a lot of the things I used to do. Such as not eating unless he was around to remind me (as I used the excuse I \u201cforgot\u201d a lot). I used to count calories consistently and I think that maybe rubbed off on him. I comment on my weight a lot whether I was having a high or low. \n\nI am afraid that maybe I gave him the tools he needed to not eat, in a completely unhealthy way (I\u2019m not sure if this is the correct wording). I am afraid he is using everything I did and like my title says, I\u2019m afraid I gave him my tendencies.

We are open with one another and I ask him if he ate that day, as I always have and as of late he tells me no. He will eat something like ramen and call it a day and I\u2019m very worried. \n\nThe other night he said something that makes me worry even more. He said he \u201cfinally understands it\u201d and I just am looking for advice mostly. Please no one make me feel worse about this, I want him to be open with me. I want him to be okay, but I don\u2019t know if I will be okay with myself if I did this to him. \n\nI am so sorry for having to even ask for advice, I apologize for the length.

I\u2019m 24, and finally decided to go to my doctor for help losing weight this past December. She prescribed my phentermine and I\u2019ve been on it since, while taking some breaks here and there. I\u2019ve lost a lot of weight and would like to lose more to reach my target. \n\nNow I\u2019m scared I\u2019ve gotten myself into an unhealthy cycle of binging and fasting. When I binge, it\u2019s literally anything I can get my hands on. The amount of food I consume during my binged have decreased, however it still feels like the same uncontrollable feeling. Immediately after I get an urge to make up for it. So I fast for however long I can last until my next binge. My fasting days consist of a crap ton of caffeine and protein shakes, typically two a day mixed with espresso. When I\u2019m not eating solid food, I\u2019m able to see my weight loss. I feel skinny, and I get obsessed with that feeling because I\u2019ve never been able to achieve it any other way. Any kind of compliment I receive on my weight loss or how I look just adds fuel to my desire to not eat. I start to fear food. I get uncomfortable around it, and I struggle so much while preparing food for my family. I\u2019m scared that taking even a single bite of something will result in a binge. The minute I eat any kind of solid food in any amount, that feeling goes away completely and my reflection goes back in time six months to the body I had before. I feel fat again. I feel disgusted with myself again. And I binge again. This cycle has been repeating itself for months. My last binge escalated to the point of taking a laxative immediately after to attempt to lessen the damage I had done. Part of me is worried that I\u2019ve developed an eating disorder of some sort, and part of me argues that I\u2019m just a fatass and even if I have, it\u2019s not like it could hurt anything. Part of me wants to seek out a therapist to talk to, and part of me is terrified that if I do that I\u2019ll have to stop taking the phentermine and I\u2019ll undo all of my progress and gain it all back. I\u2019ve tried so hard to wrap my head around all of this myself, because I\u2019m scared to tell anyone, but I just can\u2019t comprehend it all. How do I begin to figure out what this is, besides going to a therapist? Every time I\u2019ve wanted to talk to someone about it, I convince myself that I\u2019m just being over dramatic and that it will come off as attention seeking. But it\u2019s only escalating and it seems like it\u2019s starting to affect everything I think and do. My entire days are spent with obsessive thoughts about either how badly I want to binge, or fighting off hunger and convincing myself every minute of the day to not give in and eat.

Before these time I had been obese, I was about xxx kilograms with 169-170cm of height (Sorry for using metric scale, but I don't really know anything about lbs etc.). I started to be starving myself for almost eight months. I lost a lot, I weighed 68 kilograms. And there bulimia started. I was binging and starving for the next six months. After these six months I decided to eat normally (as normal as somebody after anorexia and bulmia Can eat) and to be going at the gym. I gained almost 10kg in the period of two, three days and my weight was still increasing, slowly but it was. I was terrified and after one month I decided to stop it and to eat much less. I don't know how much I was currently eating, but my contact with the food was better, besides the fact that I was hungry all the time. In june (this year) I went to a dietician, I told her everything and we assumed that reverse-diet will be the best idea for me, because Im still afraid of gaining weight and I want to maintain my actual weight. I started at the point of 1500 calories and then I lost some kilograms. I weighed xx kilograms and then I jumped into 1600 calories. I was supposed to eat 1800, for the last two weeks, but I went to a summer vacations with my parents and I was not able to count everything. As I assume, I ate something about 1400 calories per day, which was a very big regress for me. I had two hunger attacks during our trip, when I ate something about 4000-5000 calories. Yesterday I came home and stepped on my weight. Now I weigh xx kilograms, with 171cm of height. I don't know what to do. Should I start it again? From the range of 1500? Or just jump into 1800cal, which I was supposed to eat? My dietitian is on a vacation right now and everything I Can count on is this group. I also wanted to ask about going at the gym, during reverse-diet. My body looks bad, I do not look healthy. And I know what my 66 kilograms of weight are just fat, I think that I got rid of the most muscle mass of my body. Now Im skinny fat with loose skin. Do you think that going at the gym will protect me from getting fat cells, and increase the muscle mass?

Well, my brother is here, but he mostly just makes something for himself and makes extra so I can have some. When my brother doesn't make anything though I can easily get by on a small portion of whatever leftovers are in the fridge and a peanut butter sandwich. My dad came home tonight though and my brother didn't want to eat any of the huge Tupperware container full of leftover pasta from last night and my dad already had dinner on the way home, so he took us out for fast food. As much as I want to restrict I decided to be responsible and not pretend I wasn't hungry. My brother got Burger King and I'm not familiar with the menu and couldn't read the menu boards to check calories, so I decided to just go to the Taco Bell on the other side of the parking lot. I figured I could just get a couple beef burritos and that shouldn't put me over maintenance. Anyway, when we get to the Taco Bell my dad pointed out the posters for this new thing they have called a double quesarito. He said they're really good and the poster said only 845 calories (*which I'm hoping meant for the box meal and not just the quesarito, but looking back I'm not so sure*), so I figured I may as well try it. *This thing is huge.* I don't know a human being is supposed to eat this and then also eat a regular taco, a fries supreme, and cinnamon twists on top of it. I had the taco and then could barely manage half the quesarito.

She's smart, funny, compassionate - every bit the woman I fell in love with.  That's the way I've always seen her.  We've been married for five years this coming October.  I haven't always been the best mate to her, but I've learned, and I've adapted, and I've done everything I know to do to try and make up for my inadequacies in the past and to be the best support she could ever have.\n\nMy wife has always struggled with her weight.  When I say \"struggled,\" I'm saying that the idea of it has dominated her every core, her identity, since I think when she was a little girl.  Ever since she was tiny, family and friends would call her fat and ridicule her.  She got on diet pills at like 9 and was pretty much cutting and purging as a way of life.  There was some sexual assault at various points as well, and she also has been diagnosed with bi-polar, though she's off her medication now and that part seems to be more or less the same afterwards.\n\nAnyway.\n\nWhen we got married, I thought everything was okay.  I didn't know that she was constantly throwing up half of the food we'd eat, and cutting almost every day to handle stress.  I used to joke around with her weight, not intending any harm or malice, and not realizing how much it was hurting her until much later.  We eventually moved up north, and life threw us some curves - homelessness, two kids, serial unemployment, the works.\n\nFast forward to now, anyway.  She got on keto after our daughter was born and she went from about 230 to 130 now and still dropping every day.  She fasts, she restricts her diet (I think she's down to under 500cal every day, less if she doesn't \"remember\"), and if she has more than that, she feels \"bloated\" and usually throws it up or is in hysterical anxiety for the rest of the day.\n\nShe is drained.  She has no energy to function.  She's an anxious mess 90% of the day.  She's started having panic attacks again.  She has trouble breathing, she says, when life gets even remotely stressful, as life does.  She is touchy, angry, defensive.  Nothing I do helps; in fact, often by existing it seems like I make things worse.  She often says that she wishes she were dead and that she hates having the kids and that she just wants to go off alone and never come back or never wake up.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what to do.  I know she loves our children deeply, and she expresses that.  And she loves me, too.  But when the stress takes over - which it usually does, and she's liable to go from okay to fiercely angry and annoyed at the drop of a hat - then she'll get more and more angry, cry, shriek, mutter, and rebel against everything that's said to her.\n\nI'm at a loss.  How do I handle this?  I'm watching my wife waste away, and she has stated she has no intention of changing anything, and that if she dies, then that's \"fine, whatever.\"  I can't get help - no one will take her until she's in a life-threatening condition, but she's deteriorating pretty rapidly and her moods and energy and spirit are just disintegrating.  I don't want to lose her, I don't want her to lose the kids, and I don't know how to help her.  I feel useless here.\n\nI guess if anyone has anything helpful to say, I'm all ears.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

Noone else notices this or knows that I weigh 1lb more than I did yesterday! There are people enjoying their outfits without thinking about it!\" \n\nAnd I somehow felt better about myself. I was also wearing shorts and a crop top and went to another store without thinking: \"Omg, do I look fat? Do I look huge? Is my cellulite visible?\"\n\nI wanted to buy vegetables and fruit and within this paradise, surrounded by bananas, salad and melons there was a young couple. Boyfriend around 6'2'' or 6'3'', looking like a male model and his girlfriend almost 6', super long legs, thick long blonde wavy hair, sunglasses on top of her head, little makeup and drop dead gorgeous. Her face was SO symmetrical, she had the perfect hour glass figure.\n\nI was standing next to her while staring at the variety of fruit and instantly felt like a huge failure. I'm just 5'1'', I felt (and still feel) like a dwarf, an ugly disproportionate dwarf. I can't even describe how I really felt. It was horrible. Like I'm completely  worthless.   \nI changed aisles but they followed me for like 15minutes, until I saw them at the checkout. So I went back to the fruit and then? Two guys, mid-20s, muscular, clearly hitting the gym like every other day or daily - staring at me. Yeah dude, I know I'm ugly and short and not as toned as you are, so stop staring. I looked away, grabbed my blueberries and went into another aisle for my zero sugar icetea... guess who's looking for some soda and beer? Yep, the dudes. I couldn't even concentrate enough to find my zero calorie version of icetea because I felt so horrible, so I just grabbed a random Monster zero..  \nI even had to stand behind them at the checkout, and one of them was always turning around and looking down at me. I was internally waiting for some harsh comment but gladly - no comment made. \n\n  \nWhy do I feel like this? Why do I constantly feel judged for things I can't do anything about?

I am an aspiring model and because of this there\u2019s a lot of pressure to be a certain size. Modeling is the love of my life, it\u2019s all I ever want to do. I want to be good at my job and be a sample size and I believe there\u2019s a healthy way to lose weight and be fit but I unfortunately fell victim to those fad diets that are advertised all over the internet and it caused me to have a binge eating disorder. This happened around five months ago, I had been trying to lose weight doing really well, working out and eating healthy during the week and then having a relaxed weekend but it was a very slow process. I saw this ad that promised I could lose a lot more weight than I was losing and a lot faster and I took the bait and started the fad diet and I would see such wonderful results each time I gave it a go but it was never sustainable. I would blame myself for failing and I would tell myself that I lacked will power and that\u2019s why I\u2019m unable to sustain the diet and I would gather up as much discipline as I could, get back on the diet and do it consistently for a week but by the weekend I would undo all my efforts because I would binge eat anything and everything. I just never managed to maintain my results because of this. It started a cycle, every week I would try and fail and each time I would fail I would literally stuff my entire face with insane amounts of food. Whatever was there in the fridge or whatever that was cooked, I would eat huge amounts of it. I would get so full that I would have to lie down and rest because it was so uncomfortable. This has been happening since March of this year. Recently on my brothers birthday I stuffed myself so much I got acid reflux, my mum had to stay up with me because I could not sleep, I was in so much pain. I had to take medicine for this. \nIt was only recently that I realized that I have a problem. That the dieting I had been doing had really wreaked havoc on me mentally and on my relationship with food in general. I had a chat with my brother about it because he is so understanding but because he isn\u2019t a professional he didn\u2019t know how to help me. He encouraged me to join reddit and post about my disorder because the community here is so helpful since there are a lot of people who have been through what I am going through (or worse) and have come out on the other side. So my question is, how do I start to heal my relationship with food. What tips worked for anyone who had B.E.D ? What should I do ? What should I not do ? Any help , any thing I should read or watch that\u2019ll help? All help is welcome xx", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

The severe bingeing tied with the loneliness and isolation it brought. And now after struggling for so long I\u2019m left feeling purpose. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve harmed myself so much that I just don\u2019t want to be here anymore. And If I\u2019m here I\u2019m just wanting to eat all day. At this point with BED, I literally eat all day. Like 30,000 calories worth. I miss when I cared and I actually wanted to fight this. I wish I could just go back and time and stop this addiction that lead me down this depressive path from happening because honestly my life could have gone very differently these past few years. I just graduated this past May and I have literally no good memories of high school. I started homeschooling sophomore and junior year after attempting at going to school and giving it up due to my constant bingeing and depression. Then my Senior year I was planning to go to a therapeutic boarding school and truly giving a last chance at life, but then my school district declined giving me any financial support and it was too costly for my family (they just wanted to get me graduated so they didn\u2019t have to pay for nothing lol). And most of my schooling was done from home because my school wasn\u2019t willing to give me any classes at the school (I started the year thinking boarding school was gonna happen, but by the time I realized it wasn\u2019t it might have been too late for them to get me off of online schooling idk). My entire high school life minus my freshman year (though that year was still rough for other reasons) was literally just me eating and crying and wanting to die. I don\u2019t even understand how much stomach has never burst with me doing nothing all day but eating for so long, but I guess humans are different and my stomach did get used to this binge eating. I also am covered in scars and severe swelling from cutting myself all the time.\n\nI\u2019ve been in Orlando for the past week and haven\u2019t binged.

I just don\u2019t know where else to go, and I don\u2019t know how.\n\nI know posting this on here likely is pointless, but sometimes I just like posting my problems onto the internet for strangers to read so lol \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

Would like some support.", "author": "cocoakobra", "self_text": "edit: god sorry I type so much lmao I just rly like going into detail\n\nThe last couple days I've been struggling quite a bit with purging urges. I have anorexia and my typical ED behavior is restriction/exercise, but when i start to feel overwhelmed/trapped by my body and that feeling doesn't dissipate for quite some time, I get purging urges. I know if I ignore them long enough they will go away, but sometimes the desperation to make them just stop in the moment gets the better of me. As many of you probably know, purging urges feel violent and pervasive.\n\nYesterday I slipped up really fucking badly and purged my breakfast while over at my boyfriend's house. I'm so, so worried it seems to him like I'm headed into a hard relapse or that, I don't know, it affected him in *any other negative way* to've caught me purging. I care about him deeply and I know he cares about me and is well aware that I'm in recovery from an eating disorder, I know he has confidence in my ability to recover. I don't want my ED to be anywhere near a major piece of who I am to him. I don't want to hurt him because of my ED. I want him to see that I take my ED seriously too and I want to make it very clear I don't want a slip up like that to happen again.\n\nFuck it, I'd do anything to make sure it didn't happen again. Gotta go drink the blood of a goat to atone for my ED sins? Sure! Fucking whatever, I just hate this disorder!\n\nI don't know. I trust him that everything is okay, he forgives me and life will go on, but my ED always sticks me with this horrible sense of self-loathing and sort of \"impending doom\" feeling. I always get in my head that doing what my eating disorder wants puts me one step closer to ruining my life and being alone. Basically, I reflexively equate \"I slipped up and did an ED behavior\" to \"I deserve to be hurt or to have something taken from me as a consequence.\"\n\nSo far, what I've done to atone for my slip up was eat dinner with him (and a dessert afterward) and keep it down, and then distract myself and just to fun things with him. He was very forgiving and trusting and words can't rly convey how grateful I am. He sees a lot in me and that means a lot, I want to prove it to him (and myself!) that I really am more than my disorder. Later in the evening, however, my purging was brought up again(no foul on his part) and I ended up getting mad at myself about it all over again and sobbing, and I think I'm still stuck in that loop of worry because I went to bed kind of upset.\n\nIs this just one of those situations that'll simply take time to mend? (Like, will it just take him seeing repeated actions of me caring about my recovery to fix this) What should I do? And any other support or feedback is welcome. I'm also open to conversations that are constructively critical of my behavior. I just want to be better than this.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

{"post_id": "cin8rh", "created_utc": 1564263079, "title": "What recovery looks like to me.", "author": "SevereTell", "self_text": "**Background:** I started my BED journey about 7 years ago when I was at the lowest point of my life. I was in a very emotionally abusive situation at work where I was constantly mocked and humiliated publicly. I felt extremely worthless and my closest friends would not empathize with me, leaving me very socially isolated. This threw me into a severe depression which I strongly feel trigged my BED.\n\n**My relationship with food before:** I turned to food and the binges just got more and more frequent. I would leave work so upset and exhausted, and all I could think about was stopping at a drive-thru for fast food. I'd eat it in the car in shame and get rid of the evidence before my family saw. I'd buy cartons of ice-cream and bags of chips (always gotta hit the salty sweet, you know?) at the store and wait til everyone fell asleep to binge. In social gatherings, I'd always be the first one done with my plate and the first one up for seconds and thirds. I'd stack my plate so high and afterward think \"why did I even get this? I don't like it\" and eat it anyway. I could barely hold conversations if there was dessert nearby, it was more exciting and interesting than the living breathing people in my company. I would lie to get out of social events just so I could hit up a few stores, stock up on supplies, and have an extensively planned binge. Eating was seriously the highlight of my life. I'd try something random like veganism or intermittent fasting or keto or paleo thinking, praying that it would be a quick fix, a one-decision solution, and I'd always cave after max 2 days. My self control was nonexistent, my confidence was shot. It was terrible. This went on and on for YEARS. I gained a ton of weight, to the point where I didn't even recognize myself in the mirror. I really messed up my gut and my skin, and I struggle with the consequences to this day.\n\n**My relationship with food now:** I still love salty-sweet. I still love dessert. I still love FOOD. But food is no longer the only thing I love. I wake up in the morning and I have breakfast. I make sure I fuel myself in the mornings. I don't feel nervous starting the day eating. I eat again at lunch time, then a snack a few hours later when I'm feeling munchy, then at dinner. Sometimes I have a snack at other times in the day, but only if I want to. I eat way more fruits and vegetables now, and purposely try to get veggies and probiotics in every day to help my leftover gut issues that my BED caused. I eat with other people when I can, because food is nice but company is better. I can eat a dessert after a meal, but I don't need or obsess over it. I can also eat part of a dessert, feel satisfied, and put the rest away or give it to someone else. I eat home-cooked food wayyyy more than I eat out, which is huge for me. I've learned that not every meal has to be the most delicious thing in the world, and it's okay to eat something kind of bland as long as it fills and fuels you. There will always be another delicious meal or treat on the horizon. A lackluster meal won't send me into a frenzy for satisfaction. Lastly, SOMETIMES I BINGE! Yes, you heard me! Sometimes I go to the store and plan all the junk I'm gonna stuff in my face - I'll get chips and candy and eat them alone mindlessly while watching a really good show. I can't control myself around popcorn, at all, I will eat the whole bag every time. Ice cream never fills me up, I can eat a ton of ice cream still. Sometimes I eat wayyyyy too much pizza in one sitting because cheese is amazing. I don't feel guilty. I don't worry about calories. I enjoy the food. And I move on with my life. I don't do it often, maybe once every two weeks or so? But I'm not sure because I barely keep track. And that's perfectly fine with me. As long as I'm hydrating and getting my veggies, I'm comfortable with this.\n\n**What helped:** Food is still really good, but so is life. My depression lifted, not magically but through a shit load of work on my part. I cut out some really toxic people and put more energy into the relationships that lift me up. I left my previous work situation and found one where I feel respected and valued. I use social media intentionally and my feed is filled with self-love, body-acceptance, bodies of all sizes, empowered women, and feel-good posts. I discovered a love of hiking, have started being more active, and really appreciate my body for letting me move and do the things I love. I watch a lot of self-improvement stuff on youtube and I purposely try to speak kinder to myself in my head. The more kindness and love I gave myself, the less I obsessed over food. The more I focused on being kind to my body instead of fighting it, the less it fought back. The weight started to come off, slowly over several years, but it still came off. I can't overemphasize that this was a slow, slow process with so many ups and downs, but the time was going to pass anyway, right? I look in the mirror and I recognize myself again. I'm happy with who I am and how I look and I'm proud of myself for getting to this place.\n\n**My advice:** THE BINGE IS A SYMPTOM, I REPEAT, THE BINGE IS A SYMPTOM! You're binging for a reason, and fad diets, restriction, self-hate, etc. are part of that reason. Being cruel to yourself is not going to stop your binges. Your binges come from a source of negativity, and only positivity can fight that. I know it's cheesy. I know it's not what you want to hear. I know it's not quick or exciting or easy, but it is very real and very possible to stop.\n\nWish you guys all the strength and love. Hope this helps someone!", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

Throughout my entire youth I turned to massive amounts of food for comfort and around 15- I started purging as often as possible. It's hard to classify myself as a bulimic, due to the inconsistency of the my disorder. I spent so many years denying it as an issue I couldn't control. Hell, not eating for three days was a form of control in my delusions. Binging and purging was another way I felt control.

I was at a music festival, working on a 14 person crew and we had scheduled meals. At that point, it would've been easier to classify me as a chubby anorexic.

{"post_id": "cizyqc", "created_utc": 1564341136, "title": "How My Orthorexia Nervosa Started", "author": "M3gaC00l", "self_text": "Hi guys,\n\nI'm a (mostly) recovered individual who had orthorexia nervosa, with an intense fixation on sugar-free foods aside from fruits, and a refusal to eat anything that had trans fats in them. I dunno, I had a lot of weird requirements for food, and most days my meals would consist of one organic and crunchy peanut butter sandwich with a banana as well as a single package of Uncle Ben's instant rice. Unless my mom cut up some vegetables for me, that was pretty much all I would eat. \n\nI would run 5km every day as well as 10km every 4 days, and I did a half marathon ( 21.1km) once every month. I still drank a ton of water, and usually I would eat a protein bar and a banana before each run, but I would fairly often go on a fully empty stomach, which resulted in me throwing up some real nasty-lookin bile sometimes. This, combined with my restrictive eating, resulted in me, before its onset being a 6'0\", 160lbs, 15yo male, dropping to 113lbs over the course of half a year, and developing stress fractures down my tibia that caused severe pain in my shins and prevented me from further exercise.\n\nBut while that's all fine and dandy, what I really wanted to share with you guys was how the disorder started.\n\nSo, I was taking full advantage of that summer because it was the first bit of time off I'd had from sports for a long, long time, and I wanted a bit of a break before heading into the new soccer season. I played in one of the highest youth leagues in my area, so being fit was a must if you wanted to play.\n\nBut summer-me didn't really care about that. I binged on the anime *Steins;Gate*, found a new obsession with Dr. Pepper, and drank like 5 cans of that every single day. This continued for a few months, until one time I was watching another anime, *Charlotte,* which honestly kind of sucked and I wouldn't recommend watching it lol. There was this one scene where this character named Takajou or whatever takes his shirt off while swimming, and the dude is like anime-ripped. The main character made a comment about his muscles, and I was like oh frogs what about me. \n\nThat was that. I looked down at my stomach, which honestly was still skinny thinking back on it now. I then looked over to my Dr. Pepper empty can mountain, lined up in three long rows across my nightstand. The next day, my orthorexia started in full-force seemingly out of nowhere for my family, and my long struggle with the disorder began. My trigger was literally some lame anime I was watching while drinking soda.\n\nBut yeah, being a weeb can have its consequences. I still struggle with eating foods that are \"unhealthy,\" and I still can't eat sweets or anything with trans fats in it. But aside from that, I meet my nutritional needs and now at the age of 18 I am back to 150lbs, and am gaining muscle thanks the the boxing gym that I joined last month! \ud83d\ude04 I don't know why I'm sharing this, but I just found myself thinking about the long journey my stupid disorder has taken me on. I wish you guys all the best with your disorders and in your lives in general, and I would love to hear any stories you guys have. Don't give up... even being on this subreddit means you're striving towards beating this damn thing, and that's something you should be very proud of.\n\nTL;DR: anime was a mistake.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I'm 18 and have been going to psychology for years (not related to ED), and last year started therapy again for depression. My psychologist immediately noticed from the start that my issues with eating were not normal, and said it could end up becoming an eating disorder, ofcourse I didn't believe that and thought I was completely fine.   \n\n\nThen just a month later, I got my first ever binge, it was such a horrible feeling and I would actually cry whilst eating, she saw that whilst visiting me. Now it's been a year later, I still binge every single day, my mental state is worse, I've told her multiple times that my body disgusts me, I will binge, and then when I try to exercise to lose weight, I stop eating entirely. I managed to stop myself before, from binging too much, but 2 months ago I realised my clothes stopped fitting and my mom told me to weigh myself, and I gained 6 kgs in 2 weeks. Without noticing that I was binging, and then I wanted to starve again.   \n\n\nMy life is being controlled by my weight and my black and white mindset with food, however my psychologist, the person who warned ME that I was going on the wrong path, still after a YEAR of binging and seeing me go insane, doesn't take this seriously and just tells me to exercise and lose weight.   \n\n\nI'm currently doing a diet where you only eat 8 hours a day, which I broke many times cause of binging, but I have no idea what to do at this point. I wanted help from a dietician, but my psychologist told my doctor who wanted to send me to one that I'm ''totally fine'' and that I don't need it?! Yet, don't help me in anyway, and IGNORE the fact that exercise is a literal trigger for me, I've tried it multiple times but I can't handle it. I have no idea what to do, my entire family knows I have an issue and that it's bad, but ofcourse they can't help me other then trying to not trigger me and supporting me.   \n\n\nI've managed to slow down the binging a little, but its getting harder for me to do this because I don't see any weight loss or results, and now that college is gonna start in a month my head is telling me to just starve myself and over-exercise, or binge and give up like always. I never expected to actually end up with binging, and I don't know what to do, it's really tiring and even when you KNOW you have a problem, it's so hard to stop it... I'd love to know if anyone has experienced something similar or if anyone has any tips that might help?

I even went to my parents to ask for help, my mother basically told me that people with eating disorders don\u2019t look like I do. So I convinced myself it was all in my head, that my eating habits were perfectly normal and my outlook on weight and life was too.\n\nRecently, after years of hating my weight and intermittently working out and fasting, I relapsed and began purging again. I looked for this sub as a sort of support mechanism, a kind of group therapy I guess, and reading other people\u2019s stories made me realise how fucked my own is. \n\nI used to think that eating an entire share pack of sugar jellies, a large pizza etc in one sitting was normal, and then fasting the next few days to \u201cmake up for it\u201d was perfectly benign.

For the record, I do not have an eating disorder, but I am seeing what I believe to be a sign of body dysmorphia. So, I used to be a bit overweight, but now that I've lost that I see no difference? It's very confusing and frustrating. I've been trying to get in shape through healthy means such as exercise. However, I don't SEEM to be loosing weight. I sometimes look in the morror convinced that I've gained weight only to weigh myself and realize that isn't the case. According to my BMI I'm perfectly healthy but according to my mind I need to loose a lot more. I was wondering if this is something anyone can relate to, and something I should be wary of?", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

I wish I was the fat i thought I was when I weighed 105.  I started not eating for over 8 hours and okayed it in my head as \"intermittent fasting\". I told myself this was better then going back to drugs, but to be honest im starting to lose that battle of staying clean(still clean though)-all to drop the weight and numb out. I tell myself I cant have a disorder because I cant control giving into cravings but its ok because I balance it out with not eating. I cry myself to sleep saying if I could just drop the weight, i could find someone that could see me for who I am trapped in a body I don't belong in. I had a roommate say to me, \"I know better then to leave food out, or else you'll eat it.\" that line plays in my head several times a day. I tell myself this all isnt healthy-but im still overweight so I cant have a problem. I can have a problem when Im back to a size 0. My social anxiety of people who knew me when I was thin seeing me now is so high I dont leave my house. I am embarrassed by every aspect of myself i'd rather stay home. Whenever I eat in front of people, i feel like theyre staring, and judging. With food i feel in control and out of control at the same time.\n\nI'd say im looking for advice, but im not even quite sure because I dont know how my life became like this-or if i even want to get help. My best friend says she can get me into a center, I told her let me drop the weight and then we can talk about it. Can anyone relate to this? I just feel alone, stupid, and overwhelmed.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I have absolutely ZERO bulimic thoughts. No binging no purging nothing. I have ate perfectly the last 4 days and ate PLENTY.\n\nIs this still a form of eating disorder?

Well your just swapping one addiction for the other? But i am trying to outweigh the pro's and con's.

A bit over 2 years ago I really cracked down on my unhealthy habits and took great care of myself and got a lot of positive feedback, unfortunately this lead to some severe binge/restriction/BDD/social isolation that has been tormenting for the past 2 years.\n\nNow for the past few months I've been out with friends far more than ever before, and I've been learning to restrict less and been in therapy, however I feel the binges have gotten worse now that I have stopped restricting and I've been putting on weight at a fairly fast rate, around 10lbs of scale weight in the past month(149-160) and sometimes the eating just feels out of control, I stay active and still exercise daily, but no healthy exercise practice can make up for binging and it feels like it's getting progressively worse. Especially these past 2 days where it's just been a sugar dump(hard to talk myself into a ice cream sandwich breakfast being moderation) and that can't be healthy. Is this normal when you come out of restriction, because I just feel like a fat turd who has no discipline and is just emotionally eating. I'm trying to focus on regulating my eating, but it seems like my brain either wants to eat 24/7 or not at all and at this rate I'm just going to be a different kind of unhealthy. The only thing keeping me sane is my friend who's been assisting me with exercise and teaching me to focus a lot more on a mindset of health over looking a certain way, but I feel like I'll never be able to properly cut back again after this in a healthy manner, I know weight fluctuates but it feels so embarrassing that I hardly want to go out and see friends.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

Her friends seem quite triggering and she seems hurt a lot of the time.\n\nI never saw these red flags until now. I have a feeling she will be able to tell I have an ED if she does as well.

I'm worried about her tho, she's a nice girl but she is not just underweight, she is severely underweight. And her friends are always telling her they can see her facial bones cus she's so boney and skinny which even if it's true she looks a bit uncomfortable when they say it. \n\nIdk maybe I'm overthinking it but there are only a few other skinny girls but they don't compare to how skinny this girl is and only 1 of them showed disordered eating habits after her friend told me about how she has troubles with her family at home and doesn't eat(she is also unhealthily underweight and she doesn't eat at all and has 0 energy and is always dazed. I can kind of relate to her actually since I also have family issues and I am always dazed and tired).", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

A mix of parents using food as a distraction/treat then progressed to the diet culture in high school, then finally It became an engrained habit. I\u2019ve yoyo\u2019d in weight +/- 50 pounds for as long as I can remember. I\u2019d find a new diet plan, be excited to get it started, as I felt once I reached my dream weight, I\u2019d finally be able to start living. \n\nI\u2019d lose weight. Then pretty much immediately revert back to binging and dramatically gain back all the weight and more again. Then the cycle would repeat with then next fad diet. Weight watchers, slimming world, a nutritionalist,  personal trainer, slim fast, diet chef, 5:2 diet etc.. Everyday a preoccupation/obsession with food and my body shape.  I didn\u2019t know I had BED, I presumed I was just weak willed and that the next diet would \u2018cure\u2019 me. \n\nI started therapy as an adult when I was around 23yrs old. I had 4 different therapists - none of which recognised the signs of BED. I was text book in describing my symptoms but I had no idea BED even existed - it seemed they weren\u2019t quite aware either.\n\nIt reached a climax for me one Monday night, after a typical binge, after my Sunday night standard promise for that Monday to be different. I sat in bed and just thought I can\u2019t live like this any longer. I must stress I\u2019ve never had depression or any other mental health condition (apart from BED). In that moment I didn\u2019t feel suicidal but I felt that \u2018what was the point\u2019. It scared me. I looked for an specialist eating disorder therapist and I found one. \n\nThe journey with her has been tough and long (over 8 months). But I can finally say I\u2019m in recovery and I will never put myself on a diet again. The biggest and most rewarding thing for me now, is the mindset change I\u2019ve managed to adopt. It\u2019s more powerful than any weight loss I\u2019ve experienced. I\u2019m free of that negative cycle. \n\nA few things that helped me, in no particular order:\n\n1. I deleted my social media. I stopped subconsciously comparing myself to others all the time and couldn\u2019t see the unrealistic bodies on the sites. \n2. I stopped body checking habits. Every morning I used to check my stomach size. My therapist asked me what I was looking for and if I expected a daily change. I couldn\u2019t really answered so I stopped.\n3. I weighed myself once a week, every week. I didn\u2019t avoid the scales but I also didn\u2019t use them to \u2018double check\u2019 my progress daily. \n4. I promised myself never to diet again. Never to restrict. To accept somedays I\u2019ll over eat, some days I won\u2019t. I try to chose healthier options but I don\u2019t think negatively if I eat a doughnut. \n5. I told close friends and family that I had BED, I owned this disorder - it didn\u2019t own me.\n6. I (like many in here) read Brain over binge. Which for a few weeks afterwards I felt \u2018cured\u2019 but started to revert a little. It helped to read again at times. Also the chimp paradox. \n7. I stopped calling myself fat. Fat isn\u2019t a feeling, you can\u2019t be fat anymore than you can be muscle. Plus I stopped other negative self talk.\n8. I did the things I wanted to do. Things that previously I let my body hold me back. You know the talk \u2018 when I lose weight I\u2019ll do ...\u2019  part of which includes getting my dream job!\n9. I plan better in regards to food. I prepare meals or my mindset if I know I\u2019ll be somewhere challenging.\n10. I exercised for fun not for weight loss. Once the focus changed, I became happier.\n\nSome days have been easy. Some hard. I\u2019m okay with that. The easier days are becoming more frequent. For health reasons I\u2019d like to lose some weight, however this is happening slowly and naturally as my eating becomes more \u2018normal\u2019. I\u2019m in no rush!\n\nI hope that this helps some of you. There is hope out there, it is possible to live a life without BED.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I really hate missing out on my exercise just because I really enjoy the time I take to just forget everything and focus on improving my fitness - binging usually effects it because of the daze I\u2019m in afterwards.\n\nIs there anything you guys could suggest to help me overcome this slump and get me back on track?

I love ice cream so much, I can't stop eating until the whole tub is empty. The issue is, Ben &amp; Jerry's for example can have around 1400 kcal per tub, and that is huuuuuuge.\n\nToday I had another craving for ice cream, but I didn't grab my usual Ben &amp; Jerry's, instead I saw something stand next to it that caught my attention. It says it only has 340 kcal per tub. I thought I read that wrong, or that it was just a bait, but no. The entire thing has 340 kcal and is high in protein. It is by far not as sweet as usual ice cream, and I have to admit it tastes a little bit like flavored protein powder, but not in a bad way. I enjoyed the taste and the high protein content actually made me full after half way through, so I didn't even feel the need to eat the entire thing in one go.\n\nI don't want to advertise this ice cream instead of trying to treat binge eating disorder, of course being free of binge eating is the final goal and it is important to work towards it. However, I also know from my own experience that that will take a long long time, and setbacks will occur. So I feel like if I binge, I'd rather binge on something tasty, but also low in calories, that satisfies my binge and doesn't make me go crazy about my weight.\n\nSo if you can find this ice cream brand at a store nearby (there are more different flavors with a little more or less calories than this), I can really recommend you to try it out!

{"post_id": "cjrce4", "created_utc": 1564491175, "title": "Rant About Intuitive Eating In BN Recovery", "author": "StupidGarbageFire", "self_text": "I\u2019m in the very beginning stages of yet another attempt at recovery from BN. This is the first time I\u2019m actually working with a treatment team. I\u2019ve had a handful of CBT therapy appointments already and I\u2019m waiting on return calls for scheduling my psychiatric evaluation and dietician consultation.\n\nMy therapist mentioned in one of our first sessions that the end goal is to get to a place of intuitive eating. I\u2019ve heard this term most frequently in regard to the whole HAES/fat acceptance movement.\n\nThis terrifies the holy fuck out of me. I\u2019m perfectly willing to work with a treatment team, stop purging by means of vomiting, laxatives, or excessive exercise, eat regularly/enough/follow a meal plan instead of fasting/harshly restricting...but I absolutely refuse to stop trying to lose weight in some way.\n\nI am objectively overweight with a high body fat percentage. I\u2019m 5\u201910 and 165 lbs. This technically puts me in the \u201chealthy\u201d weight range, but after 15 years of disordered eating and repetitive rapid weight-loss/weight-gain, I have very little muscle mass and my body fat distribution is just fucked. You know, the typical \u201close it from your boobs, gain it in your belly\u201d type of fucked. This isn\u2019t some kind of body dysmorphia, believe you me when I say that I genuinely need to lose some excess fat.\n\nApparently the first step to intuitively eating is to \u201cReject Diet Mentality\u201d. I\u2019m supposed to give up on my goals of not having my stomach literally hang over the top of my jeans (absolutely not) and stop believing that diets will help you lose weight (but, they do, they have, I\u2019ve lost weight before). This just feels like giving up, \u201cWhelp, I guess I\u2019m fat, but it\u2019s hopeless, so whatever, I\u2019ll just keep getting fatter.\u201d What about all the people who successfully lose weight and keep it off? My problem is not with dieting, my problem is with binge eating, let\u2019s address that issue without fucking up my weight loss!\n\nThen I\u2019m supposed to \u201cHonor My Hunger\u201d. But I don\u2019t get hungry. I crave food because it tastes good and eating is pleasurable. It lights up areas in my brain that I can\u2019t light up with drugs and alcohol anymore. I don\u2019t ever experience a physical hunger sensation, not even on multi-day fasts, not during my cycle, not on medications, not after working out. I don\u2019t remember a time in my life where I felt legitimately hungry. It\u2019s like I\u2019m only eating to fucking masturbate if that makes sense. I just want to make myself feel good. \n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on \u201cMake Peace With Food\u201d and \u201cChallenge The Food Police\u201d. Some foods are just objectively better choices than other foods. If you tell me that no food is off-limits, I have unconditional permission to eat, no food is \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d, and then offer me some broccoli or a Cadbury cream egg, I\u2019m going to eat the chocolate 1,000 times out of 1,000. Why is it wrong of me to place restrictions on junk foods with no nutritional value? Isn\u2019t it obvious to anyone and everyone that the broccoli is a good food choice and the chocolate is a bad food choice? \n\n\u201cRespect Your Fullness\u201d. Yeah. Okay. I don\u2019t remember ever feeling \u201cfull\u201d or \u201csatisfied\u201d with less than 10,000 calories per day or physical pain. What the fuck is \u201ccomfortably full\u201d, especially in terms that a person who wasn\u2019t hungry in the first place can understand?\n\nThis turned into a huge whining rant. I\u2019m just so frustrated with this entire concept. I genuinely don\u2019t see the point in recovering from BN if I\u2019m just going to get even fatter. I would rather accept a shorter lifespan from the health consequences of having an eating disorder. I feel like I\u2019m just wasting everyone's time and energy because I don\u2019t believe the end goal is something I want or is even achievable.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I have been seeing my therapist since January and I haven't gained any weight yet. I've gained a few pounds, but was never able to keep the weight on. I have had anorexia for 11 years and I've been in therapy for the majority of that time and I've also been inpatient twice.\n\nI have about 10 pounds to gain to not be underweight and I just feel like I can't go through inpatient again at this point. I was in a mentally dark place both times I was inpatient and I was crying nonstop. Plus, the rate of weight gain is so quick in the inpatient program I would return to (it's in one of the best hospitals in the U.S.) and I remember having a mental breakdown over how quickly I was putting on weight each morning before I got weighed. In addition, the goal weight they have set for me means that I have to gain almost 17 pounds, which is so inconceivable for me right now. I don't really want to gain weight, but I know that I have to and I'm trying to trust my therapist because I really like her and I know she has my best interests in mind.\n\n**Anyway, for anyone that managed to gain weight on an outpatient basis, how did you do it and handle the anxiety and stress that came along with it?** I am able to see my weight when my therapist weighs me and seeing the number go up (even though I know it has to) makes me scared to keep eating so much. I honestly am eating more than I ever have on my own (I'm 26) and I have never been this motivated to keep trying. I'm currently eating 3 meals and 3 snacks a day and my metabolism has always been really high, so putting on weight is impossible (I was put on 4,000 calories both times due to inadequate weight gain when I was inpatient, which wasn't that common).

Tldr at end. \n\nI've been in \"recovery\" or so I told myself for the last five years, but I never truly recovered anything but the weight, which I've been desperate to lose, particularly the last two years, using my tried and true methods of undereating and obsessing about working off every calorie I even look at. About a year and a half ago, I started experiencing hemiplegic migraines every. Single. Time. I. Restricted. To save you the Google search, hemiplegic migraine is a fancy way of saying migraines that mimic stroke. I lose the ability to speak, my left side goes numb, I experience paralysis of my left arm and sometimes foot, my coordination goes to shit, it lasts for hours, always in the evening if I restricted that morning or evening before. It sends everyone around me into a panic. Migraines are a bit of a mystery still, but treatment is centered on finding your trigger, or a change in your body or surroundings that sets off a migraine response in your head. \nI've had to leave two jobs because of my inability to finish a shift and I have medical bills to pay from trying so long to figure out what was wrong with me and having to do every test under the sun. I refused to acknowledge that it happened only when I was restricting or fasting.  I'm working with an awesome neurologist, but who is now also going to regularly check my weight during my appointments to hold me accountable. It's a simple equation, right? I don't undereat, I don't have a migraine.\n My body has literally made me choose between trying to achieve a body that was skinny \"enough\" or a body that could function after 2pm. And you know what? Choosing a body that functions was and still is the hardest choice I've had to make and I have to consciously remake that choice everyday. I'm trying to stay positive, but I'm so frustrated. I keep relapsing regardless. \nI've never been able to fully choose recovery, not for myself, anyway  But what I've come to  hate more than anything, even myself and my fat, is what my migraines and health issues have done to the people around me, my boyfriend, brother, parents, friends. It makes them distraught. If I ever did have an actual stroke (runs in the family), how would I know it was different from a regular migraine? I can do this for them. And if I do this for them for long enough, really work at this, maybe eventually Ill get to a place where I'll actually choose recovery for me? That's what I'm telling myself. \nMy rant is over, has anyone else dealt with repurcussions they never even knew were possible?\n\nTldr: my body has rebelled against my constant relapses back into restricting/fasting by developing migraines that mimic strokes.

It normalizes binge eating junk food. It's not a meal out, it's not a sampling of unhealthy foods, it's pure junk. Almost all of them start with donuts for whatever reason. The rest of the day is spend eating garbage. There's no real activities present EXCEPT for eating the junk food! The people involved wander from restaurant to restaurant and store to store, seeking out junk food for that dopamine rush.\n\n2. It creates a false expectation of how you can eat. A lot of the people who do these \"cheat days\" and \"food challenges\" are in decent shape and attractive. They make a career out of their fitness and their eating. I gained about 10 shameful pounds of fat last year under the assumption that I too could dedicate one day to junk food and keep the weight off. Bad news bears: IT DOESN'T WORK. 10,000 calories is 10,000 calories whether it's portioned out over seven days or one.\n\n3. It promotes a disordered relationship with food. Even though I put on a lot of weight, I was still heavily restricting throughout the week to counteract the excessive caloric load on the cheat day. (I was doing \"slow carb\" at the time, as popularized by Tim Ferriss.) It wasn't fun. It was miserable. Aside from being bloated, puffy, and hating my appearance for six days, it wasn't healthy. I'd be starving and miserable by the end of the week, and I'd become psychologically dependent on the cheat day. Then, of course, after the cheat day, I'd hate myself the rest of the week for how bloated I looked. Rinse 'n' repeat.\n\n4. The people don't even eat GOOD junk food. Going to IHOP for pancakes?

I have been through hospital recovery before, relapsed, then forced myself to gain some weight on my own because I actually wanted to work out and get healthier. I relapsed again, and currently im beginning to accept that I don't have any other option but to try again. I know all the typical recovery symptoms (bloat, water retention, midsection gain first) but here is where I worry:\n\nI am taking it slow, and decided I need to get my weight up to at least 100lb (5 more than I am right now)  since I've read that a period starts around that weight. I know any weight I gain will go to my middle to protect the organs, then spread out over time. My fear is that since Im only around 5lb away from this first goal, im worried it isn't a significant enough gain for my body to redistribute. I worry that it will stay there and I'll be stuck with it. \n\nHas anyone else been in this situation or gone through something similar? How did it work for you?", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

However there is still one glaring issue that she can't get over and I'm not sure how to help. She knows her setpoint from before she lost a lot of weight and is certain that she will reach that setpoint again or even higher than it. She says that she used to be \"fat\" and knows that she will again be \"fat\" and there's nothing she can do about it because \"set points never go down\". She's a biomed major and is incredibly thorough with her scientific research in this area.\n\nShe also believes that there is a prominent anti-fat stigma in the world and that people who are overweight are treated worse than thin people. Her therapist says this isn't true and that her weight won't affect how others treat her but my girlfriend doesn't believe her. To be fair I've read some of the studies and just based on how people are portrayed in movies, magazines, porn, etc. it's not wrong that there is a fat-stigma. I don't think it's Pro-ED to suggest this, much like it isn't racist to suggest that black people are less privileged than white people.\n\nSo my girlfriend is trying to recover with the knowledge that she will be overweight when she's fully recovered, and is aware of the unfortunate truth that our culture is not especially kind to fat people. She thinks that she's leading herself into hell, basically. And I don't know what to say to her.

It\u2019s been every day this week, and tomorrow I\u2019ve got a conference where I\u2019m expected to eat the catered food and sit with my team. I know the easy answer is to \u201csuck it up and eat it.\u201d But I\u2019ve been working so incredibly hard to lose that weight I gained while I was with family (even if I haven\u2019t lost anything yet) and honestly would feel absolutely ashamed if I gave myself the additional calories.\n\nThose in similar situations, what do you do to get out of eating with coworkers? It\u2019s hard to sit there and watch them eat because I AM hungry, and since a good portion of the meetings are off site at restaurants, it\u2019s kind of hard to be the only one not eating, but I\u2019m mentally not ready to eat lunch everyday without feeling symptoms of guilt.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Sami and Aleen are joined by Jessie Jolles, comedian and Betches video creator. They start out with Jessie\u2019s childhood story about struggling with food, including the pressure to diet from her parents, the food diary she started in 8th grade, and the letters she wrote to her younger self. At 17:45 she shares her experience with severe eating disorders until the age of 24. She talks about joining a sorority and the way bulimia became normalized in her life. At 37:00 they discuss going to therapy and learning not to purge. At 51:20 they dive into an email Jessie\u2019s mom recently sent and discuss the way she was able to respond this time around. Why do our parents fail to recognize how the pressure they put on us actually makes things worse? They close out the show with a conversation about how fear controls our decisions, both on and off the scale. \u00a0 The first ever Diet Starts Tomorrow LIVE Show is this week!

In order to go to formal, we needed to get enough 'Merit Points', and one of the easiest one and high value points was to go do 'Healthy' activities with your sisters. I remember running on the treadmill with my sisters and barely catching up on the conversations about a party I never went to because I was so out of breath. There wasn't many asians in the sorority - there was a small Japanese girl who's ribs poked through any thing she wore, the Chinese girl who's legs were as wide as her iPhone. Everyone else was white and pale and athletic. I still don't know I even made it through recruitment. And it was toxic. I remember just eating a 1/4 cup of cottage cheese and a pickle and a saltine cracker after 3 days of not eating. I remember throwing up in a small waste bin and it smelled like acid for a week in my room. \n\nWhen I moved to San Francisco, I volunteered at the Asian Art Museum as an educator. There was this small, fragile Chinese woman, who lived alone in Russian Hill, and she would go on and on about the Asian art of flower arrangements and her recent trips to Shanghai, all while she sneaked bites of pork buns that she stuffed in a old leather crossbody bag. In an effort to relate to me, she even told me about her oldest son, who went to MIT, who studied engineering like I did in undergrad. One day she asked, what are you? And I said I was Asian. She didn't believe me. 'You're so tall, all my Filipino friends don't even go past 5'2\"!\" \n\nI met someone in the city. He was a former swimmer and Chinese. I only kept seeing him because he said he never dated Asian girls, because they were boring. And for some reason I felt validated, despite him knowing I was Filipino-American, and he probably didn't even know about Pia or Heart or Kelsey. I slept with him for about two months. It made me feel better than the Taiwanese guy, a former Tennis player with a track record of Korean girls. He never kissed me and I went down on him once for the inconvenience. \n\nNow, I live in Miami, where I am the only Asian woman for miles, and I used to hate it. I miss boba accessibility especially. However, my ED is only intensifying the longer I stay here. No one cares about where you went to school or what you studied, its all who\u2019s your personal trainer and do you know a good plastic surgeon? I thought being the only asian, no else to be compared to, who be so peaceful, but I feel so isolated and nervous to go out. I\u2019ve connected with other Asian guys here and they all tell me the same thing \u201cIf you\u2019re so lonely being the only asian, why don\u2019t you travel and go to asia?\u201d Well if I was a size 0 and I had iPhone thighs then maybe I would go but I can\u2019t, and the more I think about how I wish I could just be excepted as Asian but also fit the cultural sizing standard, is so isolating.

{"post_id": "ckaqmv", "created_utc": 1564590463, "title": "Not even sure if this is ED-related, but it might be I guess", "author": "livipup", "self_text": "I've been sick for at least a year and I don't see a doctor for a diagnosis until September, so I have no idea what's wrong. It could be something caused by my anorexia or it could be completely unrelated. I really don't know what's wrong. Whatever it is I had the worst experience with it this morning. \n\nI felt totally fine when I woke up, but I had to use the bathroom which was normal. While using the bathroom I started experiencing extreme abdominal pain, sweating, and weakness. I was in so much pain I was trembling and I thought I might throw up. I called my dad and asked him to take me to the hospital, but he said we should try the clinic first because they'll be faster. I got in to see the doctor at the clinic right away which was nice, but I explained how I was feeling and how I've never been in so much pain before and he just took my temperature (normal), felt my belly a bit, then told me there's nothing he could do and that I should go the hospital if the pain gets worse. I was already in the worst pain I've been in, but all he recommended is that I treat this the same way I do when I have mild symptoms. Mild symptoms are usually just loss of appetite from upset stomach and lethargy. I was trembling from the pain and could barely hold on to anything.\n\nThe sweating stopped a while ago and the weakness isn't so bad at this point, but I still feel sick even after taking some Gravol. I was looking up my symptoms and according to the Internet if you have intense abdominal pain and cold sweats you should go to the hospital, but this doctor didn't seem concerned at all. I've done research in the past and a bit more today on what might be wrong with me, but nothing seems entirely likely. I was just reading about something called dumping syndrome where food exits your stomach quicker than it should. All of the symptoms they listed except diarrhea were the ones I experienced today, though the article said symptoms are usually present immediately after eating or between 1-3 hours later and I haven't eaten anything since dinner last night. Another condition I looked into was gastroparesis which is sort of the opposite of dumping syndrome. In this case food sits in the stomach for too long before being released. I don't think this is the case because in the past I've had trouble gaining weight and it seems that my body isn't digesting food correctly. I would say dumping syndrome was more likely, though I don't think either diagnosis explains what's wrong with me. A common cause for gastroparesis is nerve damage in the stomach and I have read that eating disorders can cause nerve damage, but I don't know if that's only if you purge or if restricting alone can cause it. I have a friend who said that gastroparesis seems to perfectly explain what's wrong with her, but our symptoms are a lot different. She also doesn't have a diagnosis, but said she would talk to her doctor about it. A doctor at a clinic once told me that my symptoms sound like IBS and according to my research I do have a significant likelihood of developing IBS because my mom has it, it's more common in girls, and I do take estrogen, but I don't experience most of the symptoms. My symptoms are wildly different from my mom's. The only thing we have in common is that we both feel better when we take this ginger and turmeric tea she buys. I only feel better about half the time when I drink it though. It's good for nausea and indigestion, but if I'm in pain it doesn't help.\n\nI really wish I could just fast-forward to some time after my appointment when I have a diagnosis and my doctor and I have figured out a treatment plan that works for me so I can start feeling healthy again. If all I have to look forward to is my symptoms getting worse over time like this no matter how hard I try to treat myself better I don't know how I'm supposed to get through this. I already figured out how to avoid getting sick for weeks at a time, but even for as awful as my symptoms were back then I never experienced anything like this. I have experienced these symptoms a few times over the past couple months, but never this bad. I've never been in so much pain or felt so weak that I thought I needed to go to the hospital before. I just want this to be over.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Big time.  I just need to get it off of my chest, and I figured that people in this group may understand, relate, and empathize. \n\nI am so tired of this eating disorder.  And yes, BED IS an eating disorder.  It is an eating disorder that makes you gain weight, be judged, feel ashamed, and be discriminated against.  God, I am SO OVER those with other eating disorders talking about how \"skinny shaming\" is just as bad as \"fat shaming\".  How many people would opt for being \"skinny shamed\"  over \"fat shamed\"? How many people would chose BED over another ED that keeps you thin if they absolutely HAD to chose? Yeah, I thought so.  And yes, I have had the other EDs at well, and the experience with living with these EDs over BED  was very different. Fatinspo is a thing online. Unlike \"thinspo\" which is supposed to be a goal, \"fatinspo\" is supposed to create repulsion. I am NOT saying that my life was awesome when I had my other eating disorders throughout my life.   It wasn't.  But I also wasn't judged, I didn't completely isolate myself from the world, and I wasn't repulsed by my own body in the ways that I am now.  \n\nI am also just SO OVER therapy.  Are there ANY good therapists out there?  This is a more than half serious question.  I saw the same therapist for SEVEN YEARS and just got worse.  Mostly, she just nodded her head when I talked/cried/whatever and took my money.  I just saw another therapist yesterday and told her about my long history (decades!) of having eating disorders.  I was covering my body because I felt so disgusting and she said, \"Well, you aren't even that obese, but if you do become morbidly obese you can always get gastric bypass.  Right now you don't qualify for that, however.\"  NOT helpful. Not going back.\n\nI have tried 12 step programs, inpatient, out patient, nutritionists.  I am worse than ever.  I spend my days hating myself, wanting to die, isolating and I feel completely alone. I hate God/the Universe/whatever for \"giving me\" BED and living life as a fat person and what comes with that stigma.\n\nI didn't go to work today..  I feel so hopeless.  And sad.  Because this eating disorder has completely taken my life away from me, and I honestly don't know how to get it back...\n\nThanks for reading my rant.

How sad and even more lifeless I'll be. How food will become something I'm extremely afraid of. I've never had a good relationship with food but now is definitely when it's at its worst.\n\nIt makes me wanna shake myself and say 'wtf are you doing to yourself! Wake tf up! You're fucking up your body, your life, your mind!' and makes me want to find a solution. To recover.\n\nBut then I remember that I'm fat, that I'm sad, that I have no friends irl, that I have nothing going for me right now in life, so much so that I need my ED to feel both alive and numb at the same time. To feel euphoric but not feel anything else. To feel some sort of accomplishment in my sad, pathetic life.\n\nThen after thinking about all of that, I tell myself I'll get better when my life gets better. That when I'm skinny enough I'll fix it all then. That later it'll be easier to get better. That my health will be fine bc I'm fine rn. Idk... Recovery is always in the back of my mind, but I'm 100% sure that I'm not ready for it right now at all and won't be for another year or two.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

It didn't have any cliches like in starving in suburbia (the demonic rituals and the cringy coach) or weird cringy moments like in to the bone (like her getting bottle fed, or having an epiphany suddenly that she needs to recover which imo isn't how people usually accept that they need help or get help, and the cringy dude oh my goodness).\n\nI love Troian as well. Her acting was pretty good.

I\u2019ve had hip problems my whole life, so I expected them to flare up, but my knees have been continually more painful. The bonier they physically get the more they hurt, and even pressing them against something solid like the underside of a desk can be so painful I cry. I was incredibly active while I was losing weight, but I\u2019ve since gotten sicker in other departments so I can\u2019t keep the physical activity going.

Even if it\u2019s just one scoop, I\u2019ve realised that the hit of protein is enough to make me reconsider a binge! I still have meals obviously but I found a protein shake in between is a really low calorie way of satisfying a hunger pang! Plus I got a salted caramel flavour, so coupled with milk it\u2019s enough to hit any sweet spot! Hope this might help anyone!
