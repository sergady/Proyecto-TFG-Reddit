I don't know who to talk to about this. Mods please remove my post if it's not the right place for it.\n\nBackstory:\nSo a year or two ago I watched 'To the Bone'on Netflix. I thought the movie really romanticized eating disorders and was sort of disappointed that so many of my friends loved it.\n\nA particular friend really loved it. Long story short I found her secret tumblr. With a lot of proED stuff on it, thinspo, safe food lists, and some posts and photos (which helped me identify that it was her) and some notes she had written about herself that made me want to cry. The way she sees herself is shocking to me, but I understand we are all our own worst enemy.\n\nShe's always struggled with her weight and wants easy fixes. Pills, creams, 3 day detoxes etc. I lost weight when we were in high school together, and I think she was upset that everyone in our group out-grew our baby-fat, except for her. She probably always felt like the chubby girl, she would often make \"jokes\" about not eating. But I wasn't concerned because she's very flippant and doesn't stick to one thing for too long.\n\nRecently I had a breast reduction, and it was a really hard choice for me to make, I'd been sitting on it for half of my life, and I made the plunge. 4 months after my surgery, she tells me she's going to get one too because I seem so much more confident. I was very bitter about it because as I said she is very flippant and makes decisions without proper planning etc, but in the end I became a supporter. Her surgery went really well and she looks great, but I feel it may have triggered some other insecurities. After my surgery I had to learn how my new body looks, it makes your stomach look bigger, etc. I'm sure she's facing that same struggle now.\n\nBack to the blog. She got pregnant, and had a wonderful baby boy, her posts stopped right after she announced she was pregnant. I wasn't worried anymore. I thought maybe it was temporary. \n\nBut I still check her tumblr to be sure she is safe. Anyways, I haven't checked in 4 months or so, and there are a ton of new posts. Nothing written by her, but a lot of thinspos and safe lists, and a lot of body dysmorphia jokes and memes.\n\nI don't know if/how I should confront her. I'm the only person who knows about this. My fear is if I confront her, she will just make another account. I thought about telling her husband, but the breach of trust seems wrong? \n\nWe also live 3,000 miles away from eachother, so I can't have a sit-down with her, I also don't know if it's serious, or if it's her wanting to be someone with an affliction.\n\nAny advice would be very helpful, as I know it is a sensitive situation. I also know that there may be nothing I can do, and I'm prepared to be there for her no matter what.\n\nThank you.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all for your kind words and advice. I've decided to wait it out. I know that bringing it up to her will cause her extreme distress. (Which is something I hadn't thought of until done of you mentioned it, so thank you.) If I see more increasingly disturbing posts, combined with \"I lost 5 pounds going vegan!\" I will say something. She's always claimed to lose weight, but I have never seen actual results from her. So, if I see that she is changing physically, or her posts become more personal and alarming I will make the time to have a conversation.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

Last week, I had a \"planned binge\" at a sushi buffet, eating until I could barely walk and my stomach hurt. I thought nothing of it since I felt like I was in control, but yesterday, I suddenly went nuts after lunch and ate more than the rest of yesterday's calories in dates on salty rice cakes. It was a salt and sugar massacre. \n\nAfter that date/rice cake binge, I felt energetic and mentally focused for the rest of the day, even though I didn't eat anything else after it (after 12). My exercise went great too. Was it a long sugar rush or did I finally eat the right amount of calories for my TDEE? The total was 1850. I've been aiming for 1500-1600 recently and rounding them up a lot to be safe, because I can't believe I don't count as sedentary in TDEE calculators, since I sit most of the day even though I run and go for walks every day. (I did have an energy drink, which I don't usually do, so that might have affected my mood too.)\n\nI'm worried the binge was a sign of some nutritional deficiency or too low a weight and a beginning of a big problem. I also realized I've become so bored of the food I let myself eat that I get constant cravings for binging. So I'm going to try again to get better and stabilize my weight before binging becomes a habit.\n\nI've been eating mainly salads and fruits (basically raw vegetarian without ethical reasons \ud83d\ude05), so I reworked my self-made meal plan to include a carb source and a protein source every day like brown rice and chicken, and more protein sources for my salads, like egg or tuna. I replaced random anxiety-inducing snacks with a small evening porridge time that is unlikely to trigger binges. I came up with a very diverse 7-day menu and actually had fun planning it.\n\nThis is day 1. I still feel fine, since I get to follow quite strict rules and I'm not tackling major fear foods, but with this plan, I should get better nutrition and more calories with minimal guilt. I guess I'm posting this for accountability's sake.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I'm looking for some advice from people who isolated themselves hardcore during periods of their disorder.  \nMy cousin recovered from anorexia that was quite severe about 7 years ago, she never got formal therapy because she's uncomfortable telling a stranger about her life and I haven't been able to change her opinion on therapy even in times of health. She lives over 2000 miles from me so I'm not able to see her in person.  \n\n\nRecently she graduated college and took her first job doing tech work.  All the info I have is coming from her sibling, but her job started off good, but apparently they are just awful and abusive and only 5 out of her training class of 20 have stayed.  She originally was spending a ton of time with her work friends, but now she does not see any of them. Her sibling says that she comes home after work and immediately locks herself in her room and refuses to talk to anyone in her family. She stopped replying to my texts, snapchats, and messages about 3 months ago.   \n\n\nI don't know for sure, but I'm assuming her eating disorder is back in full force. She is stubborn and truly has never failed at anything(Straight A's through college, perfect attendance, ton's of honors). I think having this miserable job and losing her social life pushed her down the rabbit hole, but I know she won't quit this job on her own accord.  \n\n\n**My question is, what would be the best way to reach someone who is just completely isolating? Have you ever isolated yourself from everyone around you? How did they reach you?**   \n\n\nMy current plan is to reach out daily with a message that basically says \"Hello, I love you, I'm here for you in any way that I can be and if you ever want to talk, I'm available\"... I've also considered putting together a care package with resources(list of therapists in the area, ED recovery books that helped me, notes of advice and encouragement, and a hand written letter).

The hunger wouldn't stop even though I snacked a few times after eating the soup. \n\nI \\*think\\* my body sensed that this was a lighter lunch (I usually have huge salads with a good amount of carbs/fats/proteins, pasta, sandwich, etc) and it went \"*Hell no! We are not doing this restriction BS. Give me food ASAP*!\" I had not experienced extreme hunger like this in a good while.

I\u2019ve recently been very on track with my eating and i\u2019ve been doing very good but these last 2 days i\u2019ve fallen completely apart. So while i usually would\u2019ve been able to say no to a cookie, i simply \u201chad\u201d to have it today even though it wasn\u2019t even that good. And since then i\u2019ve felt so depressed and guilty and it\u2019s ruined my entire mood.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

Only a full family. Ever since my dad died she has only had myself and her. She has a PLETHORA of health issues and barely eats anything. I can cook, but don't often as it makes me feel gross or I end up making dinner for us, and she doesn't eat. (Or i cook like her and make enough for a family of 3 or 4)\n\nI have an issue(s) of eating nothing until I feel like passing out, bored eating, stress eating, binge eating, depressed/emotional eating, purging after eating, all of the eating issues. I used to and sometimes still do, view food as a reward when I do certain things. Other times I use food as what it is, just to keep me from passing out and staying somewhat alive. Other times I just want to puke thinking about food.\n\n99% of the time, nothing sounds good food wise and I feel sick thinking about eating. When I can eat, often times its unhealthy because of my stomach issues and eating healthy makes my stomach/bowel issues flare up. \n\nAnyway, this brings me to the issue my mom and I have. Example, tonight..she made fried chicken, homemade mashed potatoes and Brussel sprouts. The chicken pieces are HUGE(breasts) and i grabbed one, a bunch of sprouts and a fair amount of potatoes. I ate very little chicken , all of my potatoes and sprouts and shes giving me hell for not eating all of my food. Bare in minde these split chicken breasts are THE SIZE OF MY HEAD AT LEAST. I felt sick and full right when I started eating and about to vomit like 5 min before i stopped.\n\nI told her, i need to stop eating when im full and she interrupted me mid sentence saying \"i know what youre about to say, you always say it\" and im upset and feel like i want to throw up everything and hurt myself (selfharm via the standard method y'all may be familiar with)\n\nI straight up told her earlier, my health issues, mostly my weight, are stressing me out. I have an EMG on the 15th and i already know what they're gonna say. She says if it ends up involving surgery they wont operate cause im too fat. I cant lose weight. Ive tried. Every fucking way i can think of and it always comes back and then some. Also, you cant exercise like you want to when youre in too much pain to even walk.\n\nI told her i legitimately will just kill myself if this continues because I cant handle it anymore. She tells me to shut the fuck up and i retort with she doesnt understand. She says she does she used to be 230lbs. Im like WHOOP DEE FUCKING DOO! IM OVER 300LBS AND 5FT 4.5IN IM GONNA DIE! Add that plus mental illness being untreated because i cant find something affordable and I have a full time job, no you DONT fucking understand and you're making it SO MUCH WORSE.\n\n\nAnyway, thats a long winded summary of whats happening and rn i just wanna throw up. Im so sick to my stomach.\n\nThanks for reading?", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

I'm new here.\n\nBetween 13/14 and 22 years old I struggled with SH. The worst years were 17 to 20, where I was hospitalized multiple times and on lots of meds. I've been cut free since 2013, and even when I've thought of doing it I've not. Go me!\n\nHowever, I don't think it's any coincidence that about six months after stopping with SH I discovered alcohol at 23. I'm not an alcoholic by any stretch, but I definitely drink more than is recommended.\n\nI also started self soothing with food, and began baking as a major hobby. Whenever I feel crap I eat a sweet. It definitely stopped me from SH, buuuut since 2015 I've gained 20 pounds. (Some of that is muscle from training to black belt in martial arts, but a lot of it is excess fat). Now I'm stuck in an endless loop of eating junk and feeling guilty. I can't even look at myself in the mirror anymore because  I feel disgusted by myself.\n\nIt's dawned on me my therapy never tackled the underlying symptoms of my SH, just the symptoms. I obviously still have the emotional issues, but I've just swapped SH with disordered eating. Sometimes I imagine just slicing off all the fat rolls and putting them in the bin.\n\nI would seek therapy, but public healthcare in my country is horrific, and I can't afford private health care: a counsellor is \u20ac100 an hour, and they don't normally specialize in this stuff.\n\nHas anyone else had the same experience?", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

What started as depriving myself of calories to lose a little bit of weight for an upcoming holiday eventually turned in to dealing with Anorexia Nervosa.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWithin the following three years and a lot of counselling and cognitive behaviour therapy later, I gained back an acceptable amount of weight and landed within the healthy BMI range.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was two years ago now.

I have lived this way for two and a half years now, and need/would appreciate all of the advice I can get.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe way I control my weight is not through calorie intake and calorie counting, but by the mass of the food I consume.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past 25 months, I have been limiting myself to a small total weight of food and drink per day. So every day, my total total intake of physical weight of food and drink combined equals that weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor instance, I weigh X lbs on a morning on an empty stomach, naked and after using the toilet. At the end of the day, after eating and drinking, I weigh X lbs plus the weight of the food I allowed myself under the same conditions (naked and after using the bathroom). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe calorie total does not matter to me.

What matters is that I do not surpress the limit of physical food weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this makes sense up to now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is because when my body starves during the night the through my sleep cycle, those eight hours are spent actually physically breaking down and digesting the added weight of food/drink I have put in to my body, as well as absorbing the calories.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I have noticed is that if I consume \\*more\\* than X lbs of food and drink per day, my body will still only weigh X pounds less the following morning after sleeping (and therefore starving) during the night.\n\nThis would make no difference if the food and drink were calorie dense or deficient. What matters is the physical mass, poundage and volume of what I'm consuming and not the calories it contains.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis concept is crazy I know, and I've never heard of anyone else living a life of disordered eating this way. I have tried to explain my ways of eating to a close family friend, my mother and my therapist, but they simply cannot comprehend where I am coming from despite years of me living this way. It's driving me insane and I am desperate for help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just want to eat a normal diet and ultimately live a normal life. That is all I want. It's all I desperately long for. I want it so bad, a life that does not revolve around weighing myself up to 10 times throughout one given day to make sure I'm no more than X lbs heavier in mass due to the food and drink I have consumed. It's driving me insane to live this way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease, if anyone has any advice I would appreciate it. I'm scared to explain myself to the doctor, as I know what I'm trying to explain sounds beyond crazy and against the actual science of weight gain (which is otherwise totally dependent upon calories in vs calories out).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy weight was once balanced no matter the volume of food and drink consumed and was maintained by my calorie intake. I do not understand why this has changed with me, even despite undergoing Anorexia.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

My question is, what can I be doing in the time that I'm waiting for an appointment? I also am struggling in terms of deciding what, when and how much to eat and have been told that eating too much too soon could actually be bad for me.

If I don't see the purpose in going higher in level of care then it won't be as helpful. I feel like my choices are all out nothing right now- I either let the therapists choose what's best for me or I lose my therapists.\n\n\n\nSo I'm dipping my toes in recovery. I'm not quite there, but I want to know more about the process. \n\nI finally told my (on campus)  therapist about my b/p, I went to a doctor, I went to the dentist, I booked an appointment with a dietitian. I decided to try and join the ED group therapy on campus and I hit a snag. \n\nApparently to join the group you have to do an intake appointment. Ok, so I went. To be in the group you need to have a therapist and dietitian. Ok, that's fine. \n\nThe therapy leader conducts the intake appointment, I'm pretty honest with my responses. At the end she asks if my therapist knew how serious my behaviors were. Basically she didn't like my combination of restricting/ purging/exercising/weight. She said that she wasn't sure 1x a week therapy is enough, even if I added group. \n\nThen the group therapy leader wants me to sign a release for communication as part of the treatment team. She basically said that she'd tell my therapist that she thinks I need a higher level of care. Since my therapist is fairly young and inexperienced with EDs, I'm afraid she'll defer to the more experienced one. \n\nI decided to not sign and talk to my therapist about it first. \n\nI just want to try the least invasive level of care first. I want to give it a try. I get that it might not work, but without trying I'm not convinced it's worth diving in deeper. I'm also still adjusting to the concept of therapy, I'm shy and when I'm overwhelmed I shut down. I'm afraid that without smaller steps into seeing what treatment/ recovery looks like, I'll be too overwhelmed to participate at a meaningful level. Lastly, I'm not in a financial situation that would make it easy to seek higher care. Its not worth the sacrifice if I don't think it's needed. \n\nBut then again, I understand that I may need a higher level of care. Since the leader is more experienced with people with EDs, she will be a good resource for referrals if I choose to do more. So I don't want to close that door either.  \n\nI'm just afraid that if I sign the release, then they recommend me to a higher level of care. I'm not ready, so I don't want to. I'm either forced into it or lose my therapist.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I don\u2019t know why this was a thing - he never gave me any reason to feel that he would judge me for eating but I\u2019m still so scared that he will judge me for eating. \n\nMy last relationship was with a trans guy who was into chubby chicks, and was bigger than myself, so I never felt inadequate - I always felt like I was higher than his \u201cstandard\u201d. Like I never had to compare myself to some elusive ideal. \n\nWith the guy I\u2019m dating now I was paranoid that he would think my body is disgusting, or that he\u2019d be used to the thin, flawless bodies in porn, and even now after almost 9 months together, and countless compliments, countless sweet nothings and no reason to believe that he isn\u2019t attracted to me I\u2019m terrified. For the longest time we\u2019d eat the meals we didn\u2019t prepare together separately, at different times and in different rooms because I was too embarrassed to eat in front of him if he wasn\u2019t eating. It made me anxious and insecure. He\u2019d eat breakfast before me anyway because I never talked to him about this. My fault. \n\nAnd with the discovery of my obsessive eating habits, he learned cooking with me or for me was too much. Now it\u2019s something we do less and less. We don\u2019t eat takeaway foods together, or snacks together - it\u2019s like he\u2019s learned eating \u201cnot safe\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d foods is a \u201chim\u201d thing, something I can\u2019t do without it ending in tears so he doesn\u2019t bother. But I want to. My body isn\u2019t good enough for me to allow myself that, my body isn\u2019t perfect or \u201cnormal\u201d so I can\u2019t eat like I\u2019m as such, but I want to. I want to be a normal girl with my normal boyfriend and I want us to enjoy normal food together. I hold all this importance in food, all these ideals - eating together is something people enjoy. But we can\u2019t because my brain is wrong and my body is wrong. And God forbid we plan ahead to eat anything I deem \u201cunsafe\u201d because if something goes wrong it will end badly. We can\u2019t even have snacks in the pantry because I\u2019ll *want* them and he won\u2019t and it will just make me feel guilty and angry. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten really bad, too, to the point where I\u2019m afraid of food. I can\u2019t eat without him putting food in front of me. I can\u2019t eat unless he wants me to. I\u2019m scared that if I do eat without him and he asks (because, sometimes he does) I\u2019ll have to tell him that I did - it makes me feel like I\u2019ve done something wrong, somehow. And I really fucking can\u2019t eat in front of him if he isn\u2019t eating, still. I\u2019m scared of eating something without him and him catching me in the act. Why does food make me feel so guilty? Why? Why am I like this? \n\nI just need to know it\u2019s okay. I just want to eat with you. I want to feel like I\u2019m not doing something wrong. I want to share meals with you because if I don\u2019t, if I eat on my own everything just feels bad and wrong and gross. I want to eat normally and I want to eat all the junk food I\u2019m always craving with you. \n\nI wanted to eat those fries last night but you didn\u2019t fucking ask if I wanted any, you didn\u2019t even ask if I was eating dinner and I just wanted to sit down and eat fast food with you like a normal couple, because you want me to be normal too, right? But instead I drank my diet energy drink and exercised alone in the other room while you ate and I was so tired and hungry and mad at you because, I guess, when my eating is somebody else\u2019s responsibility it\u2019s so much easier for me to cope with it. I always need to follow your cues. I guess you were pacified by me telling you I ate some fruit and a peanut butter sandwich yesterday while you slept and I know you didn\u2019t think about it again but I was so hungry, so hungry, so hungry and I felt guilty for not just being happy I could get away with only eating so little. \n\nAnd did you know that If we ate junk food together it would be more okay? I can\u2019t eat that bag of potato chips by myself because it\u2019s gross but if we ate it together everything would be fine and I would feel normal and that\u2019s all I want. \n\nI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m like this. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m doing this to you. When will you ask about my breakfast? I don\u2019t know what to eat, and I\u2019m scared to, and you won\u2019t think about it again because you already ate too much without me and I just wish we could eat together I\u2019m so scared I don\u2019t know what to eat and I don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m doing something wrong but I\u2019m so sick of not even being able to stand up properly I\u2019m so hungry and you won\u2019t even notice. If you weren\u2019t here, if I didn\u2019t have to get up each day and be a functional human being, I would just lay down and rot like I used to when I didn\u2019t have to care about anything.

But about 2 months ago I found out I weighed about 180 pounds. Sure I\u2019m used to being the short and chubby kid everywhere I went but actually knowing how much I weighed hit different. I started eating less which most people thought was normal so I went with it. But I started thinking about how much weight I could lose if I didn\u2019t eat at all so I tried that but didn\u2019t even last the day \ud83d\ude05. So I started purging right after eating.

I\u2019ve tried actually eating without even thinking about purging but I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t keep my food down anymore. I can\u2019t eat as much as I used to be able to, which could be a good thing because I used to eat A LOT. Like whole pizzas by myself. But now I can barely eat 2 slices without wanting to puke.

I tell myself it\u2019s fine but it feels like there\u2019s someone making fun of me. Calling me a bunch of names and judging me. But no one really is right? The logical part of me is telling myself that everything is fine and I just need to eat more healthy things and lose the weight in a healthy way. But I can\u2019t eat. Well I can technically. But I know I\u2019ll end up purging so I don\u2019t want to because it\u2019ll be a waste of food. \u201cThere are starving children in Africa\u201d I tell myself that when I eat but I still purge.

I started having nightmares, my grades dropped, since it was a new school I had no friends, and I never got to say bye to my grandma. I started cutting.

I've been getting better and have been off meds for about 6 months (with doctors\"permission\" since the period after my last symptoms was long enough). \n\nOne of the worst ways my depression affected me was that I couldn't eat. It wasn't a weight thing at all. I just got sick from the tought of food and everything tasted like shit.

I hope this isn't the wrong place for this discussion. Sorry of it is.\n\nOkay, going on. During the year that I was sick, I lost almost 15kg. I was already fit before but lost soooo much muscle and fat during my illness. I was constantly tired and cold and miserable since the lack of fuel in my body made me dizzy. I also had a love-hate relationship with my body and how it looked.\n\nI've now gained weight since getting better, around 10kg, mostly fat since I haven't had the time to get my muscle mass back. I love the way I'm looking now and just want to get more fit and gain some buff arms :D. \n\nI'm 164cm and weigh 61kg, my fat % is around 25. That's perfect for me. I just want maybe 2-5kg more in muscle.\n\nBut still. Having been so skinny before and now some of the clothes I bought then don't fit me... I feel insecure about my weight gain. And the worst part is, I don't know how to tell people about this. I have a pretty new relationship (7 months) and I've told about my depression, but haven't gotten into the details too much.  Especially this whole ED part of it is a very touchy subject for me. \n\nNow during our relationship I've gained around 6kg of the whole weight. He has noticed it. He makes small comments meaning well. Examples: 'we should eat a bit healthier' or 'would you like to start swimming at the pool house now that you can't at the beach anymore?' (I love swimming and I'm guessing this is more a suggestion for me to continue my favorite hobby during the winter too). \n\nQuestion 2: he has obviously noticed my weight gain and I don't know how to tell him that it's a good thing and that I wasn't happy with how I looked when we met and am happier now.. I'm scared that he isn't attracted to the curvier me and wants the skinny me back.\n\nTLDR: I was too skinny before I met my bf and have gained weight. I don't know how to tell him about this being a good and healthy thing for me since I'm very ashamed of my illness.\n\nThanks for reading and please I'd like some advice and to hear what you think.", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

A lot of stressful things have happened lately, and between about may and June I lost over 20 lbs without even trying just bc of stress, I wasn't intentionally not eating or anything. After that I sort of stabilized, but I started drinking, a lot, which has been going on since. \n\nOn Monday something snapped and I just decided to stop eating. Full disclosure, I was super hungover, depressed, feeling shit, and my brain was like \"I'm gonna kill myself by not eating.\" I still wanna die but I don't wanna starve to death and I don't wanna kill myself. The problem is, I haven't been able to start eating again... I've been drinking a lot of alcohol and coffee, and yesterday I nibbled on some cheese and veggies and had a piece of toast, and today I had 3 chicken nuggets and like half a small order of fries, but I feel like I can't keep it down.

All was good. \n\nThe other victory was that on my day home alone, I didn't binge. I do really well sticking to my CICO plan when I'm around other people. It's always been secret eating when I'm alone. On a day off before I would eat anything and everything and would go to the store or to fast food for more.

I have not had symptoms for four months! \n* My sex drive is returning and sex doesn't hurt anymore. \n* My hair, nails, and skin are all stronger, much less brittle. My nails used to break and peel all of the time.\n* I don't pee as frequently anymore (pelvic floor dysfunction). \n* I actually have real periods now with a stronger flow. And I now experience menstrual cramps and breast tenderness LOL!\n* I don't get as cold as I used to. I remember one time I felt like I was freezing and it turned out to be 88F outside. Now I can manage in the 60s!\n* Holy shit! Totally forgot. Went to the dentist yesterday and I have no cavities and healthy gums! I used to be at heavy risk for gingivitis and would always get a cavity or two, in spite of proper brushing and flossing.\n* My metabolism shot back up! Wow, and I forgot to mention that I totally hear my hunger signals now :D\n\n\nVery grateful to be in this community with such strong support :) Thank you!", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

The weight comes hanging on my shoulders, tugging at my wrists and fingertips, dense around my throat and hard in my lungs as I finish a bag of tortilla chips big enough to serve 13 in under 5 minutes.

I'm sure if I didn't have this food obsession then I would be able to lose the weight I want. Men find me attractive, people think I have a nice body. But when I look in the mirror, I don't even know what I see. I spend my nights googling my BMI and measurements. I am constantly zooming in and comparing photos of my past self and photos I see online.

I don't eat until 1pm most days. Do hardcore, bootcamp-style exercise at 12, and try to eat a small lunch and a medium-sized dinner. No carbs other than veggies and moderate fruit. No sugar. Usually, at least once or twice a week I binge in secret. Literally. I'll wait until my boyfriend is out of the room to sneak food.

I started off the meeting by lying about how much I really weigh. (I weigh more than I look- which is another thing that fucks me up). Anyway, I was pretty honest from that point on. She started by telling me how I need to eat in the morning and snack so that I'm not stockpiling my calories and tempted to binge. She said to have a small piece of protein in the morning and eat healthy snacks. I nodded and smiled, knowing deep down there was no way I was going to listen to her. Not a chance. If I eat in the morning, then I spend more of my day thinking about food.\n\nDoes this mean that I really don't want to get better?

They have been struggeling for a long time with anorexia and bulimia. A couple of weeks ago they asked me why I dont throw up after I binge because while they understand my disorder that is the one thing they never understood about binge eaters. I said that I think that in those moments I dont believe myself to deserve to get rid of the food/calories again after a binge (we know purging doesn't actually do that, but its the concept that counts). They said that in their five years of ED therapy they learned that while there is always a negative motivator (punishment, you dont deserve this, etc) there is always also a positive motivator (binging itself might be a 'food fills your emptiness' kind of thing). So my question is, why do we not purge? Why is it that we actually keep the food down? \nLike what is it that we/our brain is gaining with that?\n\nps. Im not, not at all trying to say bulimia would be the answer here, it is simply a different side of the same problem, I'm just trying to understand myself and my disorder better.\n\npps. purging is an example im using, but i also am not restricting or doing tons of sports after a binge because i dont feel i deserve to \"make up\" for the binge.\n\nppps. again please dont take this in a way that would be me saying guys we should all just throw up or become obsessed with running, you cant just replace one eating disorder with another, im just confused by my own psyche and wondering if anyone has got this figured out", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I didn\u2019t grow up around dieting and my parent never pressured me about my weight at all. I was not a particularly fat or skinny teen/young adult I gained weight during college but nothing significant.  In terms of BMI I was about 10lbs overweight by the time I turned 23 and I decided I wanted to do something about it. Once I was on my own I ate out a lot and lived a mainly sedentary lifestyle my main goals were work out-I signed up for a 5k with 3 months to train  ( I couldn\u2019t even run a mile at this time) and decided to cook way more often and try to incorporate healthier foods in to my diet. Looking back this was a great healthy approach to losing weight no calorie counting and no good or bad foods. This worked very well/ I was noticeably thinner in 3 months time- now this is where things took a turn for the worst. \n\nI was addicted to the results and I needed more and quicker.  I became obsessed with eating \u201chealthy\u201d I started cutting out more foods and associated sugar and fat as \u201cbad\u201d and  I made every effort to avoid eating \u201cbad\u201d foods. At first it wasn\u2019t that difficult- I dropped more weight. 30lb lose in 7 months was pretty good and I guess I had reached my goal weight, but then my goal changed-gain muscle bc I was now too skinny. By this point I was basically scared of  refined carbs &amp; \u201cbad\u201d fats and eating out or drinking alcohol. I stared calorie/macro counting which became obsessive  and addicting. It controlled my life and eventually led to disordered relationship with food. I stared having binges and uncontrollable cravings for \u201cbad\u201d foods. I was going out of my way to binge eat foods I never even thought about before dieting. The more I tried to control the binges the worse they got. I got to the point where my goal was no longer to gain muscle but to not gain weight from binges.  I would sometimes go 2-3 weeks in a cal deficient and lose a few lbs then binge every other day for a week and gain another few lbs. This pattern went on for almost a year. I felt desperate to stop the binges but I was also desperate to be in control of my weight. Gaining weight felt like throwing away all the hard work I put in to losing 30lbs. \n\nFinally!!!! A month ago I read Carolyn Dooner\u201ds The F*ck it Diet! She basically states that in order to stop the binge/restrict cycle you have to allow all foods and stop dieting completely. Learning to neutralize good will heal the unhealthy relationship that some dieters have. The tough part for most people is accepting the fact that weight gain will happen and once food is normalized and binges go away you MIGHT lose weight or you might not but trusting your body and its hanger cues and set point weight is what is going to truly heal you! \n\nSo now one month and I already feel so much calmer about food! No calorie counting, no food scales, no foods are off limits! It\u2019s absolutely freeing! As soon as I decided I was going to do this I was SO ANXIOUS to go to the store and stock up on all the foods I told myself I couldn\u2019t eat. I stocked up on all the goodies and the first two weeks I ate ice cream every single night.  It\u2019s since reduced to only a few nights a week without really trying. My anxiety around food is already ten fold less. I bought so many snacks the first few weeks several of which are still in my pantry not fully eaten because my desire for those snack has lessened so much. Don\u2019t get me wrong I\u2019m not eating as healthy but I\u2019ve still eat fruits and veggies daily. I don\u2019t crave sugar the same way I did 6 weeks ago! I have had a few overeating moments but I have had no major binges. I don\u2019t have the craving to eat until I feel sick. I\u2019ve feel no shame about my eating and It\u2019s a freeing feeling. I continue to work out 5-6 days a week because i truly enjoy it. I have not weighed myself but I know for a fact I\u2019ve gained lbs in the past month ( not surprising ) and it honestly makes me feel self conscious but I\u2019m working on not letting this affect me and I\u2019m really trying to not judge my weight fluctuations in the next few months because I know this journey isn\u2019t about my weight but about fixing my relationship with food. I honestly do not think I could gain back the full 30lbs even on the F*uck it diet since I\u2019m very active and luckily I\u2019ve developed a passion for cooking at home over the last two years. I enjoy fruits and veggies but also pizza and ice cream! I\u2019m slowly learning what the balance should look like.  I feel this going in a very positive direction and I think my weight will level off at exactly what it need to be over time!", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I\u2019ve lost 28 pounds since July and am feeling healthier. Basically, in case you aren\u2019t familiar with the drug, it\u2019s an opioid receptor antagonists which blocks the reward you would get from things like binge eating, alcohol, Berlin\u2019s, etc.\n\nThis all sounds great, right? WRONG!!!!\n\nThe first couple weeks were nice. Then I began to lose interest in so many things. I stopped getting the mood boost from exercise, I stopped caring about gaming, I stopped going on bike rides, I stopped practicing my musical instrument (which pays the bills), and I even lost interest in my wife sexually. I guess that\u2019s what happens when you have a drug shutting down the pleasure center of your brain.\n\nSo anyway, I felt like a zombie.

Unfortunately, i started binging and purging (at least twice a day) thousands of calories since I started college in August.

I can\u2019t focus and bombed all of my midterms. And then today at work I felt super sick the whole time and then 7 hours into my shift when I was trying to replace the ice in the smoothie machine I accidentally cracked the menu screens with the ice barrel and broke them. I started crying and then my coworker said to just ignore it and act like nothing happened. I didn\u2019t know what to do and I was already super disoriented and I just went along with it and tried to stop crying. I was already planning on quitting because my boss was scheduling me for 20+ hours a week and I can\u2019t do that because I\u2019m fucking lazy and tired and incompetent. No one else seemed to notice so I just finished my shift. And then when my mom called me to ask how I was I just broke down and told her what happened and she and my dad started yelling at me about how I was horrible and needed to go back to work and tell them what happened and that I can\u2019t quit and I told them I couldn\u2019t.

I was \u201cskinny\u201d to begin with. My metabolism is fast.  It\u2019s just my body frame. whatever. Growing up my parents and siblings and friends would tease me about it. For a long while I really I loved it. Who doesn\u2019t want to be skinny? Who doesn\u2019t want to constantly have your friends tell you how great your body is? Relatives always commented on my weight when they\u2019d visit. Friends always told me they wished they could look like me. My mom would make comments to my sister about how she should eat less so she could look like me. Skinny became synonymous with good. Skinny became synonymous with beautiful. Skinny became my identity. I\u2019ve been skinny my whole life. That\u2019s the biggest consistency. I hung on to it. I used to love it. It fed my self esteem. Until it became my self esteem. \n\nSomewhere along the line my body changed and I gained some weight, healthily. Truthfully I think I just started getting a \u201cwoman\u2019s body\u201d. But I felt this pressure from everyone around me to maintain this identity of being stick thin.  When I was stressed, when I was alone, when I was sad, when I was angry, when I was hurt, when I felt worthless, I just focused on being skinny. I\u2019d focus on restricting to make myself skinnier. Because in my mind that meant better, that was more beautiful. I\u2019d starve myself for days. I\u2019d restrict. I\u2019d exercise until I became sick. I\u2019d throw away my lunches at school and spend lunch hour in the library so it wouldn\u2019t be as obvious that I wasn\u2019t eating. I\u2019d make excuses for having \u201ctoo much homework\u201d to eat dinner with the family and I\u2019d just \u201ccome down and make a plate later\u201d.  I\u2019d show up to practice an hour earlier just to run so I could burn extra calories. In college it got worse, when I didn\u2019t have to hide from anyone, and I could be as aggressive as I wanted. And the seemingly positive comments about my weight only fueled it. Most girls around me gaining the freshman 15, and I only got skinnier. \n\nThe older I\u2019ve gotten, the healthier I\u2019ve tried to be. I\u2019ve tried to better my relationship with my body, with food, with exercise. I\u2019ve gained weight. I\u2019ve gained 8 pounds over the last 6 years. I try to tell myself I look good with a little meat on my bones and fuller tits and ass but deep down I hate it, because it\u2019s not my identity.

He didn\u2019t seem too happy about this. We back-and-forthed a bit; he mentioned how difficult he\u2019d probably find it to notice I\u2019d gotten bad if I wasn\u2019t emaciated. Goal: set. \n\nLater, he was doing some gardening outside with our housemate. They disappeared around the side of the house for a little while, and when they came back I caught the tail end of a conversation. \u201c...yeah, I think I\u2019ve been ignoring some things.\u201d from my boyfriend. \n\nLater that evening dinner was a bit of an ordeal - at my prompting he was doing something not vegan for himself and my housemate. (\u201cI would be happy with just instant noodles for dinner, as long as you eat something.\u201d He had said. \u201cYou should make Mac and cheese for yourself and *housemate* if you\u2019d like, I promise I\u2019ll eat something with you guys.\u201d) I was going to put some fries and vegan nuggets in the oven but I struggled with preparing it. A couple beers in and I was a little more blatant with my disordered eating than I normally would have been. \n\nThat night, he initiated A Talk\u2122. This was honestly something I hadn\u2019t been expecting - he\u2019d barely discussed any of this with me, and as much as I knew it really spoiled his mood when I\u2019d go on self-hating tangents and such it was hard to realise just how much he picked up on. Honestly, the concern in his voice was heartbreaking on its own. \n\n\u201cWhat can I do for you? What\u2019s something small each day that you could set as a goal to make eating easier?\u201d \nHe talked at length about how my body wasn\u2019t getting enough food, and how obviously it was making it hard for me to function both physically and mentally - especially surprising because he\u2019d always seemed so dismissive of my brain fog and exhaustion. \nHe called me out on \u201cjokingly\u201d asking him and my housemate earlier that evening if I was \u201callowed\u201d to eat. \n\nHe continued to list some other behaviours I thought had gone right over his head, as well as point out that I had been particularly lethargic lately, less interested in things I once enjoyed. He made some allusions to depression. \n\n\u201cWhen you get to your goal of being underweight, I don\u2019t think it will be enough. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be happy with your body. It won\u2019t end, and you\u2019ll keep moving the goalposts.\u201d Called. The fuck. Out. I was shocked.\n\nI was drowsy, sleepy, and a fair bit tipsy, and I was having trouble with the conversation. Certainly not something I could follow too well at the time, nor take seriously. \nBut, I was taken aback. I couldn\u2019t get over how much he\u2019d noticed. How much more observant and intuitive he was than I\u2019d thought; and my heart was breaking. I think he was having trouble with the conversation. It seemed to hurt him to say these things aloud. \n\nI can\u2019t help but think - I\u2019m not subtle. This is my fault he\u2019s hurting, and now that he\u2019s actually brought all these up there\u2019s no way to leave it floating in the air anymore. If I keep getting worse, he *will* know. I resent myself for it, in part; I\u2019m not bad enough for that kind of concern or attention. I need to get worse before I deserve it.\n\nAnd I really don\u2019t know how to feel. It\u2019s crazy.

I get it wrong sometimes, but without numbers to obsess over it\u2019s easier for me to refocus.  \n\nI also wait until I\u2019m well and truly hungry before I eat my first meal of the day.  That usually means having something small in the morning and then waiting until after work for my real meals.  This isn\u2019t on a specific timeline; some days I eat earlier than others.  I just find that larger meals are more satisfying and I don\u2019t like going to sleep hungry.  \n\nWhen I do eat, I have whatever I feel like within reason.

Now I am seeing light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n1:  \u2018 this next food item is not going to satisfy me. It is part of a never ending impulse\u2019\nThis was a huge (but seemingly obvious) revelation to me. It took the fire out of me mid binge. Food was no longer a tool but a sensation. That isn\u2019t to say I stopped eating right there and then, but it made me stop sooner.\n\n2: \u2018 Am I feeling stomach hunger or head hunger?\u2019\nLocate where in your body you\u2019re hungry to differentiate how you feel. Eating too little as a meal will make this harder to do\n\n3: The 30 minute rule \nOn the way home from school I would get so excited at the idea of eating that my head would buzz. I would supplement my desire to binge with a detailed plan of what I would eat and how. I was so sure that I wouldn\u2019t binge when I got through the door that it took me by surprise.\nBy timing 30 minutes as soon as I got in, I would do something FUN with the knowledge I was still allowed to eat, just not yet. \nI would get jittery and impatient, but it gave me time to reflect on my current state and took out my urgency to eat.\n\n4: Time your meals \nI ate everything at lightening fast speed anyway. Depending on the size of my meal I would set a timer on my phone and pace myself so it lasted the duration set. It gives your brain time to process how much you are eating and simple made me feel like a normal person\n\n5: Write down all your feelings and track your progress\nBinging triggers your reward centre, but so does proof of progress. \nI made and printed out a few copies of a table which detailed whether I had completed the 30 minute rule successfully, whether I binged etc. \nSoon you will notice patterns.\n\nYou\u2019re not going crazy. You are not gluttonous nor weak. Binge eating is a very real disorder and is triggered by the disruption of a very primal impulse. But you can work together with your body to figure out the best route out of this mess. \n\nForgive yourself for fucking up. Because you will. Time and time again. Maybe for months or years to come if you\u2019ve had this problem for long enough. But make sure that everyday you\u2019re recovering more ground. Perhaps you throw half a Ben and Jerry\u2019s away instead of \u2018might as well\u2019 finishing it.\n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s waaayy more that could be added to this, but these are just some tips that were very helpful for me.

If I attend something like a buffet, or go to a restaurant without a calorie count, I end up overeating past fullness.\nI don\u2019t want to say I binge, but I have found myself standing over a homemade cheesecake in the kitchen, unable to stop myself from having more because it tastes so good. I\u2019ve never purged, but on one particularly bad day where I had no idea of the calorie count of the pasta I was eating, I would chew it and then I would spit it out into the bin because I so didn\u2019t want to be consuming hundreds of excess calories against my own will.\n\nI\u2019m technically underweight by BMI, at 53kg (I believe around 117lbs) and 175cm (approximately 5\u20199), but I don\u2019t look it at all. I don\u2019t even look that thin\u2014my shoulders are quite broad, and my thighs aren\u2019t remotely small.\n\nI want to stop counting, but reading certain weight loss subreddits have made me certain that I\u2019ll gain all my weight back (and then some) and end up right where I started, at a weight at which I wasn\u2019t comfortable at. Whenever I stop counting, I feel terrible because I always have a really hard time sticking to my goals even when I\u2019m counting\u2014I\u2019ll set myself a limit of 1200 and eat 1700 sometimes because it\u2019s so impossible for me to restrict. So people\u2019s advice that I should \u00ab\u00a0just get back to counting tomorrow, let today go!\u00a0\u00bb doesn\u2019t work for me! I eat a surplus of hundreds of calories and when I count, my deficit for one day ends up being not nearly enough to lose the fat I\u2019ve inevitably gained.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve shared quite a lot now, but basically\u2014I\u2019m 16 years old, and I\u2019ve had my period since I was about 11? This is the first stretch of my life in which I\u2019ve missed it, and if I don\u2019t get it this October, it will have been 6 months since I last had it.\n\nI don\u2019t want to gain any weight, even knowing that might be the only way to get my period back. Though I wish my legs and stomach and shoulders were thinner, I\u2019m much more comfortable than I used to be with wearing clothes that I actually like. I used to cover myself with hoodies and refuse to wear T-shirts, but I actually wear things I like now. I don\u2019t want to lose that, and I don\u2019t want to gain a single gram. I just joined a college to do my A levels, and everyone there is thin, thinner than me but I can tell that\u2019s down to being toned. I don\u2019t feel that they\u2019re underweight; they look like they exercise a lot, whereas I can\u2019t bring myself to exercise knowing how slow the results show and how foolish I look attempting to lift weights with no previous experience.\n\nI feel like if I get up to a healthy weight, I\u2019ll hate myself more than I already do. I\u2019m always comparing myself to other people, getting jealous of my friends who are 50kg even when I know they\u2019re about ten centimetres shorter than I am. I want to be petite and cute, but I\u2019ll never be petite so I\u2019ll settle for thin.\n\nI do want kids in the future, so despite my ridiculous rant, I know I need my period back. I\u2019ve seen the doctor about the issue, and I\u2019ve had a couple blood tests\u2014they\u2019ve concluded that I\u2019ve lost my period due to stress and weight loss.\nThe logical solution would be to gain some weight, but I really, really don\u2019t want to. The highest I\u2019ll go up to willingly is 54kg, and that\u2019s still underweight for my height.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m fucking struggling, and I wish I could go back to pre-February 2019. I mean, I hated my body, but I didn\u2019t count a single calorie, and I was FINE with that. I miss being happy to go out with friends to a place without nutritional information rather than cancelling my plans because I\u2019d rather eat a Tesco\u2019s 400 calorie sandwich than log 1000 calories \u00ab\u00a0just in case\u00a0\u00bb and starve myself for the majority of the day.\n\nI haven\u2019t been diagnosed with an ED, so I\u2019m honestly not sure whether I have one. I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have anorexia because I can\u2019t bring myself to restrict for long periods of time. For the most part, I eat like a normal person, but with a shit ton of junk food and with a lower calorie limit.\nI want to be normal again, but I don\u2019t want to undo all my progress and hate my body again.

We were starving but couldn\u2019t afford any food. \n\nIt\u2019s been 7 months now and we are doing great with money and live in a wonderful apartment but the both of us are clinging on to old habits.\n\nWe only eat once a day, and if we try to eat more we can\u2019t and feel sick. We feel hungry all day but have no desire or motivation to eat. \n\nMy boyfriend works late hours so what we\u2019ll do is wait till he gets home which is around 5pm and that will be our first meal of the day, we used to at least order huge meals so we could take in our days worth of food in one sitting but recently We can\u2019t even finish our one meal. I don\u2019t think either of us have finished a dinner in at least a month now. \n\nLast week my friend brought up that she was concerned for our well being and that we looked skinny and that we are basically starving ourselves.we never really even thought about us having an issue and I still don\u2019t think we have an eating disorder but I\u2019d like to hear peoples opinion.\n\nSo basically, we aren\u2019t eating until late hours of the day/night and when we are eating we are either shoving it down our throats or picking at it.

She was the thinnest and the sickest, the only girl who got tubed. I never quite got into the recovery mindset while I was there, and while I was getting \u201chealthier\u201d all I could think about when I saw her was how I wanted to be that skinny. I was underweight when I got there but felt like it wasn\u2019t \u201cenough.\u201d\n\nAnd I\u2019m feeling guilty because the way I acted towards her was so toxic. She was such a kind girl who cared a lot about the people around her, and was well loved by everyone there. She tried to be friends with me. She would ask if I needed anything when I was visibly upset. And while thankfully I was never outright mean, I shut her out, because I was a jealous bitch.\n\nThat was in July and August of 2018. I never graduated from ED outpatient, rather got discharged because they felt they weren\u2019t equipped to handle my other mental illness symptoms.

They were just a whisper at first. There were small things, like body checking in the mirror or by circling my fingers around my wrist, and casually checking food labels again, but I haven\u2019t used any symptoms.\n\nBut apparently I haven\u2019t learned anything from my mistakes, because her death has set off those voices again.

I ate side dishes and drank a lot of iced tea as well. Even some white rice. And then after that, I ate a macadamia cookie from the school cafeteria. After 2~3 hours, after class, we went to the Korean store and ate Korean spaghetti ramen. Then, around 10 pm, I got home and ate some KFC chicken tenders(? I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s available in other countries). I thought I would gain a lot of weight, but when I checked the next day, my weight didn\u2019t bulge at all. I was so confused because I didn\u2019t exercise or anything at all. \n\nAnother time, I ate breakfast. For lunch, I had 2 pineapple pizzas from the school festival. Then, I got tempted by cookies, so I bought 12 and ate like 6~8 and a small glass of milk that came with the cookies. Then, for dinner, my friend made me eat chicken wings with her, I think ate about 4 wings. I don\u2019t remember if I ate anything else but I was so full that night. When I weighed myself, I didn\u2019t gain weight at all.\n\nIs there an explanation for this? Why sometimes, I don\u2019t gain weight no matter what I eat, but some days I gain despite not eating much? Sometimes this happens during/after my period. For some reason, I could eat fast food for lunch and dinner and manage to still lose weight/maintain. It\u2019s weird. It\u2019s like some days my body wants me to eat a lot but some days it\u2019s telling me that I\u2019m a fat monster. Does this happen to anyone else too?", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I've had this shit brewing in my mind for the past few weeks, and this post has been sitting in my drafts and I really want to get it out but for some reason it never comes out right. But I guess it\u2019ll never be \"right\" so I might as well just post it \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nI just started my 3rd year of university, and honestly I've been feeling super nostalgic about high school. I guess back-to-school season always gets me feeling like this, but it's hit especially hard this semester since I guess you could say I'm going through a bit of a relapse. My ed was definitely at its peak in high school, so comparing myself now to then is super triggering.\n\nAt the same time, I can't say I ever recovered. I just gained weight, but my mental state is still \\*very\\* much in a restrictive mindset. Like, yeah, I go through the motions and eat \"enough\" but I never reached that point of being able to casually grab a smoothie with friends between classes or enjoy any spontaneous free food that is, seemingly, perpetually available all over campus. This brings me to my next point, which is pretty much the biggest thing that troubles me: my life has been completely and utterly fucked up by this fucking disorder.\n\nRemember how I said I've been nostalgic about high school? It's funny, because in high school I couldn't \\*wait\\* to get out and go to college. I was so excited to finally start my life! By the end of senior year, I was in \"recovery\", passably happy and healthy, and genuinely excited about the future. And at the time, the future seemed pretty bright. I had this whole idea of what university would be like -- classes would be super easy like they were in high school, I'd be able to somehow become one of those naturally thin girls, guys would be \\*all\\* over me, I'd have a healthy social life, etc etc etc.\n\nTurns out, none of the above happened. I'm still just as stuck, mentally, with this disorder, as I ever have been.\n\nReflecting on my college experience, and comparing it to that of my peers who, presumably don't have eds, my life is just so empty. And that's exactly how I feel about the years I lost in high school to my ed.\n\nI care a lot about my future and I'm passionate about what I study, but I've definitely been held back by this fucking eating disorder. School has been really hard -- my grades and my capacity to learn have suffered tremendously because of restriction throughout the day, obviously. Not only that, but networking events and things like that often either include a) food or b) dressing up, which I'm too fucking insecure to do. And seeing others around me thriving and socializing and doing internships and setting themselves up for success, when I \\*know\\* that should be me, and could have been me, is fucking difficult. \n\nAnyway, I'm not really sure what the purpose of this was.

I went to the emergency room and told them I had relapsed and hadn't eaten in over 2 weeks. They were surprisingly gentle with me and actually took me seriously. They took some blood, urine, and gave me fluids because I was dehydrated. My potassium was low, but everything else was good, which makes me feel like I blew the whole thing out of proportion and essentially wasted everybody's time. Including yours.\n\nThey gave me a referral to a day treatment place for anorexia, but I can't go. I'm not even that ill. My blood pressure was PERFECT. My heart was PERFECT. I feel so stupid. So what did I do? What every normal, intelligent person does after finding out they're healthy: I ate some cheese fries and a burger, and then threw it up. I don't throw up. I haven't since my ipecac days when I was a teenager... But yesterday I did. I figured I was doing a good thing because eating like that on such an empty stomach would've been just as bad. That makes sense, right? Right?! Um, no. No, clearly I want to be sick. Clearly I want attention. ALL the attention. I am never going to the hospital again. I wasted everyone's time there, when they could've been helping someone who actually NEEDED it. God I make myself sick. Aha. \n\nSo today, because it is Sunday, I am drinking a bloody Mary and going to watch a movie in the theaters (Joker). I do like that I can keep starving and my body actually likes it. I feel like I can continue doing what I'm doing for at least another few weeks without causing harm to my body. Maybe extended fasting is legit. Maybe I am really just an unpure faster. Maybe she's born with it...Maybe it's the bloody mary. \n\nIn all seriousness though, I'm sorry for causing you guys to worry or care. If I'm going to hurt myself like this then I don't get to complain or ask for help.  This is on me.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I told my psychologist I want a dietitian and she said they will just tell me to exercise, but exercise always triggers me to stop eating entirely and if I eat 1 chocolate that I should just give up so I do. But recently I went to my doctor for my 4 year hairloss and she said she's sure I have PCOS since even the hospital said about a year ago that I might have it, and that weightloss might be harder for me. I'm pretty devastated at this point, knowing I kept blaming myself for not being able to lose weight unless I exercise like a psychopath which hurts like shit, and now finding out my body makes it harder to even process food. So my binging has gotten worse, and when my binging stops I just don't eat. Life truly is amazing. \n\nOn the good note, I've been binging on less food cause my mom buys less food, and have lost 3 kgs after hitting my heaviest weight in my life 6 months ago, which was a nice surprise seeing that I didn't need to starve myself, I hope this can help me start a new beginning and actually succeed this time.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Like, maybe, my eating habits are disordered. But then again, I'm a fat cow and I think I'm just faking for attention. I'm 165cm and I weigh around 66kg (which is around 5'5\" and 145lbs).

Became super paranoid, obsessed, self conscious. I fractured my sacrum, got super scared because my bone density was very low and went full on into recovery. Ended up gaining 100 pounds, going to college, not exercising at all. And within a year or two I was down 50 or so pounds, eating to hunger, and not exercising with my weight staying steady. Fast forward to this year. Id previously started rowing 1-2 times a week. Still felt like I was in full recovery. Then I started a job that was super stressful, so I started running before my 12 hour shifts (bad idea). I somehow got it in my head that I needed to run before every 12 hour shift to negate the stress. Definitely missed the signs of compulsive need to exercise sneaking in. Stopped eating as much during work, began denying myself food when I was hungry, started opting for salads and skipping breakfast. Luckily I was able to catch on and after 3 months of no menstrual cycle I stopped all exercise and went all in again. Now, I've had one period. And I know that the smart thing to do would be to let my body heal more and give myself more time before doing exercise again (and being way more cautious this time around). \n\nI think that my brain is somewhat in eating disorder mode still because I'm constantly having to remind myself that if I want to live a happy, healthy, productive life I need to let go of the need to be a certain body size and the need to compulsively exercise. \n\nBut, I still miss exercising. I miss running in particular. I miss it because Im decent at it and I miss feeling fast and strong. But, I also know I have a tendency to take it way past healthy. \n\nShould I give it more time? I guess I'm worried because right now it feels so easy to be compulsive and I know that my brain gets way more normal as I feed my body enough over time.

Let\u2019s be real, a binge is total abuse and it never feels \u201cgood.\u201d I usually have terrible stomach pains, heart racing, sugar headaches, cuts in my mouth if I\u2019m binging on chips, nausea, heart burn. Replacing all that abuse with self care rerouted me from a binge. \n\nNot sure if it\u2019ll work for me again but definitely gonna try it next time too. Maybe you can give it a shot too?", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

Learned to enjoy both good and \"bad\" foods. Then it all paid off. After 3 years, I finally got pregnant. \n\nSure there were still the thoughts. The guilt. The obsessing, of course. Boy does my brain love obsessing. The first symptoms were bloating. My weight went up 6 pounds by week 8. I obsessed. Every pregnancy resource is sure to mention how there is no need to gain weight in the first trimester and some women even lose a few pounds due to morning sickness. God how I hated reading that. But all that was easy to push aside. I was so unbelievably happy. Every symptom was a rush of joy because it meant my baby was growing. Chocolate chip, blueberry, gummy bear.\n\nI had been pregnant once before but only made it to 7 weeks before a miscarriage. So naturally, I was an anxious wreck this time around. I finally started to relax at 8 weeks. My symptoms were undeniable. I felt so very pregnant. The risk of having a miscarriage dropped with each day. \n\nThe first ultrasound was at 10 weeks. By then, I was sure we were safe. I was so excited to see my baby. To hear the heartbeat. To get that ultrasound picture to show to my amazing in laws. My husband and I were practically skipping into the doctor's office. But the scan showed an empty gestational and yolk sac. The doctor told us maybe it's just sooner than we thought. I knew that wasn't possible. She said we were only measuring at 6 weeks. They confirmed the pregnancy a month prior to that appointment. That would mean I tested positive before conception. I knew it was over.\n\nSo then we had to wait for protocol. They had to do a blood test to test hcg levels, then another scan and blood test later. They had to confirm everything before taking the next step. We made the appointment for 10 days from then. I went back to life as normal, knowing I was carrying death in my uterus. I was a wreck. I had never felt more fragile in my life. My car broke down and I started crying in the shop but it's not like I could explain to the mechanic that I was currently having a miscarriage. I just seemed like a crazy person. I started bleeding 3 days before the next appointment, right at 11 weeks. So much blood that I ended up in the hospital. My body still couldn't pass all of it so a d&amp;c was scheduled for Tuesday. \n\nI've come through the medical part of the miscarriage. I took a week off work. I had to, thanks to nearly passing out from blood loss. Tomorrow everything is supposed to go on like nothing happened.  My follow up is next week. My doctor sent off the \"products of conception\" to be tested to find out why the miscarriage happened. I'm lucky that she does that after 2 miscarriages. Many doctors wait until 3 or more. The baby could have had a chromosome issue. That's the easiest reason to process. But it could have also been my broken body. After years of barely surviving, how could I ever hope that I could be normal?", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I've now listened to Both of his books, because they are SO GOOD and help me with my mental health. They're non fictive and not self help books - they simply explain how the brain works when we move, and how are brains are not at all adapted to our current lifestyles.\n\nI thought I'd share this:\nDid you know that the reason we want to gorge (or in our case binge) on sweet fatty food is because this was once a means of survival? I mean yeah sure in our cases, if someone with severe malnutrition binges it's probably more a direct cause, too. But yeah, it's in our genes to want to finish the entire jar of B&amp;J, because back in the days of hunting and gathering, if you didn't eat as much fruit as you found on a good tree, chances are they wouldn't be there the next time you come by and you missed the chance to fill up on energy reserves. And this means you may actually starve to death. Our brains hasn't adapted to the fact that we can eat our own weight in sugar every day, if we want to. \n\nI am incapable of explaining it in the same cool and interesting way as the book, but the point is that those gorging genes moved on because the people who \"binged\" were the humans who survived to carry on the lineage. The others starved. This, knowing that it's a brain-genw thing and not a fault in my self control, when I binge, helps me feel better.

I used to sit down by myself at the dinner table and eat along with creators to remind myself that I was not the only one eating. Nowadays, however, mukbang and ASMR culture has evolved into a form of binge eating on camera. \n\nI would like to acknowledge two things before going on: 1) Not all ASMRtists/mukbangers exhibit such behavior, nor do those that do on camera have the intention of promoting such behavior 2) viewing or not viewing this content is solely up to the viewer; it would not be difficult for me to click away from a video, but I wanted to share my thoughts since such content has grown rather popular these days.\n\nSome creators binge on camera, seem to do off camera purging, and then continue the cycle. Some viewers may misunderstand this lifestyle and find it okay to eat far beyond moderation; on the other end, such videos may encourage viewers to see a binge-purge as normal. Reading through comments of viewers ranting and raving over how slim a creator looks despite eating so much demonstrates the thoughts which may arise from viewing such videos.\n\nWhen mukbang/ASMR was just rising to popularity, I would occasionally watch a very skinny girl binge on all sorts of foods to make up for the feelings of longing I had to eat as much as her. Viewers would ask her if she was bingeing and purging, but she always insisted she was not; I recently discovered that she had taken down her channel and all of her videos. I am no detective, but I suspect that she may have been dealing with an eating disorder.\n\nI, personally, find mukbangs/food related ASMR videos triggering and I have been trying to steer away from viewing as much as I have in the past.\n\nI do not intend to generalize those I have described in this post (creators and viewers) but I wanted to share my thoughts and perhaps hear about yours?", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

(tw: BMI, calories)", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "My BMI is 16.97. I want to return to 18.5, and my cautious side says I should do it by increasing the amount of healthy, calorie-dense ingredients in my meals. This October, I've been maintaining by eating \"orthorexia-approved\" foods. I'm happy with maintaining, but I know I should eventually up my calories and start gaining.\n\nSome other side of my brain, a more radical side, is saying to go on a massive grocery shopping spree, buy every junk food I've ever craved, and pig out until I'm back at a normal BMI. I wrote a list of my cravings and rougly estimated that it would be a 8000-calorie day consisting of sushi, chocolate, cookies, protein bars, sweets, peanut butter, sandwiches, and some salty snacks. Realistically, I would probably not finish all of it, but a large share of it anyway.\n\nI feel like I let something out of Pandora's box and now I really really want to do it, but I'm 99% sure it would be bad for me.\n\nPros (excuses?): \n\n* I would only need to do it a few times to gain enough weight and could then go back to \"orthorexia-approved\" maintenance foods. I'm not imagining it's an instant way to recover, but at least my body would get healthier.\n* I've read about extreme hunger in recovery, it being a sign that my body needs that amount of calories to repair physical damage. They also say that my hunger cues will eventually normalize and I'll stop wanting to binge after I've got the urge out of my system.\n* So many foods feel unhealthy/naughty to me, and I'll be disappointing myself anyway once I start going over maintenance calories, so I might as well go all out. If I have to gain weight, I should try to have fun doing it.\n\nCons:\n\n* Maybe I just want an excuse to develop another eating disorder (BED or bulimia) instead of getting better. I know I have to let go of orthorexia as a coping mechanism. I might be looking for another unhealthy way of coping instead of developing healthy coping skills which is a difficult task. I think evidence for this is that when I started imagining what I would binge on, I became so excited, it scared me and made me think that I really could become addicted to food if I love it that much.\n* Before orthorexia, I was a stress eater, emotional eater - basically eating for every possibly reason, and I never felt content until I was uncomfortably full, and even then I wished I could eat more. I suspect I might have had full-on BED as a child/young teen, however I was only on the upper end of normal BMI. Then I alternated between dieting and emotional eating for years until it all blew up at the age of 24. Because of this, I fear I don't have normal hunger cues I can return to, and nothing that can become normalized. I feel like the advice to eat whatever you want in recovery only applies to those who had normal eating habits before they started restricting.\n* What if I gain more weight than I intended / feel too guilty and relapse?\n\nI'm sorry that this post is so long, but debating this by myself is really ruining my day. I have a psychiatrist's appointment at the end of the month, but it's such a long wait and I want to talk about this with someone already.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Just normal. Can't tell if this is a body dysmorphia thing or if my preferred ideal is actually just severely underweight. Someone like Ariana I think would have a BMI of like 19. And my goal is way lower than that.\n\nI will even look at pics of VS models like Alessandra Ambrosio and all I can see are how massively thick her thighs are. And she is someone that most women would kill to look like and supposedly has a BMI between 16-17. Same with Gigi, her legs and hips look so big to me. At this point, I can't tell if it is my eyes that aren't working or if my goal body is really that unrealistic with a crazy low BMI. I think someone like Natalia Dyer or young Gemma Ward are more goals, not some of these celebs/bikini models. But a lot of people here don't agree with me so I'm thinking my body dysmorphia may be worse than I realized and is actually extending to other people now. I remember a time where I would've killed to look like a VS model.\n\nI also think I look about the same body wise (though my face is definitely different) as I did 30 lbs heavier, which is obviously not true. Body dysmorphia is a bitch guys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit copied and pasted in a response below: I originally opened up the discussion because I feel like I can't trust my own eyes, and now I'm even more confused than I was before. I was trying to figure out if my body dysmorphia extends to other people now too or if I simply don't know what healthy vs underweight looks like. Clearly no one understood my intention.\n\n2nd Edit: If even other AN people are calling me out and downvoting me, I clearly can't trust anything I see. This whole thing has just really upset me. I feel like I have no idea what is real and what isn't. I have no idea what I look like. I can't tell if these celebrities are promoting an unhealthy ideal or if they're fine. I can't tell what's wrong or what's offensive with anything I've said. I literally feel the way I do when I'm in a psychotic episode (Bipolar Type 1) and I can't tell what's reality and what's happening inside my head.

I also have a weight gain fetish that turns itself off and on. As you can imagine, these two aspects don't always interact well.\n\nAfter Zoloft made me gain 30lbs in college I found myself alternately horrified, helpless, and turned on. It's confusing as heck to be disgusted by your body and then suddenly think it's the sexiest thing.\n\nI started to come around to the idea that I should gain a little more weight on purpose, which at the time sounded hot as hell. At my most depraved I'd always daydreamed about doing this, but the irl fear of getting fat stopped me from seriously considering it. But hey, now I was fat anyway, so now would be the perfect time to try it out before losing all the weight, right?\n\nMy boyfriend agreed to it because he's open minded and didn't care about my weight. He joined in, but most of it came from me.\n\nHopefully I'm not being too gross when I say that it was the hottest time of my life. I basically binged multiple times a day. I tend to fall into fast/binge cycles, and part of me thinks I liked this idea because it enabled me to indulge the binging side.\n\nBut I went too hard. Way too hard. After 2-3 weeks, I noticed that I had some small stretch marks on my stomach for the first time ever. This was what snapped me out of it. My mind went into panic mode. The whole point of this experiment was that it was temporary, that I could just lose the weight after. But stretch marks - those are permanent.\n\nI've never hated myself more. I instantly stopped everything, but now my appetite was much bigger, so I felt hungry if I didn't eat a lot. My sex drive was instantly killed and I basically became a nun for 6 weeks and restricted heavily, dropping weight rapidly. Which I think possibly have me even more stretch marks.\ud83d\ude29\n\nThat was around a year ago. Since then I've binged back up and can't seem to control my eating at all. I've developed an intense phobia of stretch marks and get triggered by seeing them on myself and others. I self harm now, which I've never done before.\n\nI even freak out at marks I used to not give much thought to, like the really old, pale ones on my hips. Even if others can't see them easily, I can, and they mean I'm ruined.\n\nI've also potentially fucked up my health by putting on weight so quickly. I have hip pain that makes running, one of my former favourite activities, agony. My thighs exploded in spider veins and I think I have a varicose vein in one leg(like I can't see one on the surface, but I can feel the pain of what I've read they're supposed to feel like.\n\nThinking about my scarred, broken body makes me feel like I need to be punished. All this was my fault, and some of these things can't be reversed. I'll never forgive myself. My life is miserable now and I often just want to die.\n\nIndulging this fetish is the worst mistake I've ever made. It's destroyed my physical and mental health, but I'll never be rid of it.\n\nMy boyfriend is so upset seeing me like this and he wants to help, but there is no help for me. He says he wishes he could make me go to therapy and regrets our experiment just as much as I do.\n\nI just wish I could go back in time and stop all of it from happening.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I was barely 12 years old and had a BMI of 17. this continued for a very long time. eventually, I couldn't stay positive anymore and started to starve myself. I drank water to the point where sometimes my stomach hurt. my lowest weight was 43kg at 156cm. I felt ugly, fat, like everyone was judging me at all my competitions the season after that. I would constantly criticize videos of my routines and pause them to find which angles I looked most skinny in. I learned to suck in my stomach around my mother. I was barely 13. this past summer, my family went on vacation. breakfast was self-serve and I was happy I could start lying about how I was full again. I ate a quarter plate of food for breakfast every day on vacation and only ate an apple or other fruit for dinner. I averaged 20,000 steps a day. I was very happy to see that I was losing weight at a fast pace. When I returned home, I was 48kg, whereas previously, I was 50kg. still, my mom called me fat and restricted me from eating certain foods, on top of my own personal restrictions. I tried talking to her about it, but she told me to lose more weight. I had always focused on the number on the scale at a young age, as that was what I was taught to do. my weight fluctuated day by day, even at the age of 6 years old (I was 3'11\" and 42 pounds, with a BMI less than 16. this was what was considered \"acceptable.\") as I grew, so did my body. I had gained lots of muscle and was athletic. over half of my body mass was pure muscle. I was very healthy, and although I realized that, I continued my habits. my mom stopped bothering me for a while. she didn't notice that I stopped buying lunches and started packing lunches so I could pretend to eat. I hated my body. My mom commented on my \"thick\" thighs which were not fat, but muscle, and were not large at all. It was simply my skeletal build that gave me hip dips, and therefore the illusion of thick thighs. she stopped restricting me for a while, and I recovered. I even enjoyed deserts. Still, I did not know how to eat on a regular basis. I only knew two things: purging and restricting. Some days, my mom's attitude was back. A few month ago, I felt sick to my stomach from having a pretzel. When we went to get sushi, I tried to throw up the food, but I couldn't and felt queasy inside. My period was extremely irregular. Although I weighed at a BMI of 19 and was \"healthy,\" most of my mass was muscle and I was in-fact, not healthy. I can still feel myself deteriorating. I still can not enjoy food properly. If I enjoy myself too much I feel remorse and wish to throw it all up again. I feel disgusting. Every day, I see models on my instagram and I find myself zooming into their thighs, wondering if I'd be loved if I looked like them. I constantly contemplate quitting sports because I have to wear tight clothing and I feel judged. Being called \"skinny\" makes me feel good. I constantly make an exaggeration when shopping with my mother that my 24\" waist jeans are too loose on me. She does not have a reaction, nor does she seem proud. Maybe if I was a 22\" she would feel proud. I am 5'3\". I have no belly fat, so any \"fat\" I have must be natural, a part of nutrition for my growth. I am a teenager. I am a highschool student. I am an athlete, and that is all that keeps me from throwing it all away and starving to the death. Often, I wonder if death is the answer. I have talked with help phones 7 times in my life. They have not helped. My mother does not speak English, so she can shame me anywhere, whenever she wants. I am sick of it and I want freedom.

To the point that I'm starting to feel like the therapist is trying to address issues I don't really have. Because AN = xyz and I am diagnosed with AN and therefore must be experiencing xyz. Meanwhile I'm over here basically shouting \"you've broken me of the calorie counting compulsion but at what cost?\" because the meal plan exchange system plays into allllll the same fundamental neuroses.\n\nMeanwhile, the therapist and dietician think that continuing to measure out my cup of cereal portion or whateverthefuck is where the disorder is digging in its heels. And not, I don't know, the doctor telling me that swapping some portions around in my meal plan some days (\\*while maintaining the daily totals as prescribed\\*) is the eating disorder voice talking and I shouldn't be doing any adjusting beyond taking a meal portion here or there as a snack instead. Yeah this doctor was *really* keen about PHP during my first appt, and I'm not looking forward to that inevitable impasse.\n\nVent aside - does anyone want to share any experience/insight with weight gain expectations in the outpatient setting? How long you spent working your way up to whatever rate of weight gain/etc? If it was just a continual raising of the meal plan to keep up with hypermetabolism or whatever until you weight restored? That sort of thing? \n\nIs it weird that I'm asking that of strangers on the internet instead of the three medical professionals I see for just this purpose? Maybe! Is it a bad sign that I feel like I *can't* ask such questions of said medical professionals? You bet! \n\n(Hi, can you tell I'm chafing horribly under the revolving door of *treat the meal plan as gospel/but don't be too strict/because you're not gaining as fast as you should/but we won't tell you how much you should/and don't want you to weigh yourself anyway/but maybe outpatient isn't providing enough support/and also here's a 4 week therapy break because our scheduling is fucked*?)\n\n\\*deep breath\\*\n\nI see the doctor for the first time in 5 weeks (and I've only been going there for 7) later this week and I can't shake the fear that it's going to be a total shit-show.

Prior to this I significantly restricted my diet in order to lose weight even though I hit the edge of the underweight bmi range. \n\nMy meal plan gives me a moderately increased amount of calories to increase my weight slowly. In all honesty, after starting college again in september I didn\u2019t meet this number consistently because I was stubborn (and still kind of am). \n\nThis week, I went home and ate abundantly since my family cooked a lot for me, and my mom sent me a ton of snacks and food for college.

I've tried speaking about it to other doctors, but I never did articulate myself properly and I always ended my relationship with my therapist after that, or shortly after. \n\nI've been diagnosed with BPD, and this was definitely something that got in the way of me asking for help in a serious way, as I was very deep into reckless behaviours like binge drinking, shoplifting and taking drugs. I've gotten these behaviours under control now which is great. \n\nI had never been diagnosed with an eating disorder though, because of all this. Which would have helped, but I wasn't out to help myself back then.\n\nSo I spoke to my therapist, who's official title is my case worker. I'm under the community mental health team for my area, and he sorts out any extra therapies I'll need and gets me into groups like the emotional coping skills group I'm a part of. And on top of this, he helps me with my DBT (dialectical behavior therapy). \n\nWhen I told him, which took me a while, having never admitted to anyone really that I have a problem. He was totally great, he used to work at a place called Leigh House which is a centre for people with eating disorders, so that was a stroke of luck. I begrudgingly let him take my height and weight, found out I was 3 inches shorter that I thought I was which was fucking g r e a t news. \n\nAfter all this, after me pouring my heart out to him and telling him everything in glorious detail how deep I am in all of this, he said I didn't meet the weight requirements for any kind of referral, and that I would have to wait until my emotional coping skills group is all finished. So that way, they can see if it's all tied in with my BPD or not (treat the emotional symptoms etc). \n\nSo not skinny enough is what I heard. He did also say that he'd be forced to change his mind if I dropped another stone in a month, like I tend to be doing. \n\nAll I see from his words are challenges. I open my heart to someone for the first time, actively asking for specialist help, and I get this. No recovery for this girl, only skinny.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Giving it to him though was a whole other ordeal in itself.\n\nWe went over my blood results, which were surprisingly normal, and I knew at that point there wasn't going to be the perfect time to interject this into the conversation, but also if I didn't give it to him then, I probably never would. Literally as he was about to dismiss me, I whipped out that paper and handed it to him saying \"I'm giving this to you now, otherwise I won't tell you\".\n\nThen he asked why I think I have an ED and I just froze. At that moment it hit me what I had done, that there was no taking it back. I think I was in mild shock. Once I gathered my mind, I told him of my behaviours. He took my weight and height, and once again I'm taller than what I thought. My true height is a mystery.\n\nBut since the mental health team have refused to help me twice already, because I'm waiting for an autism assessment (go figure), he said there isn't much he can do. Which didn't bother me because my reason for telling him wasn't to receive help, it was just so that he's aware. I let him know I'm glad I told him.\n\nI couldn't really gauge his concern, because he didn't outwardly react when I told him I hadn't eaten in &gt;!10!&lt; days, but he seemed okay knowing I'm at least staying hydrated. I guess he's going to monitor me until after my assessment, at which point I should be able to get help again.\n\nI feel a huge weight has been lifted, because I (hopefully) never have to say those words again, written or otherwise.

It started with not restricting because I was doing that to try to counteract the binges which were my real out of control behavior.

I still have the same hatred towards my weight and everything else, the only difference is the fear of having to go back to \"prison\". Since this is my first post on here I guess I should introduce myself before I finish releasing my problems onto you more haha, I am a recovered/recovering Ana and I had Ana for about.... 5 years?

Maybe in 4th - 7th grade when I was growing up &amp; was a soccer player and also still had a gym class, so I had no choice but to workout everyday.

I had trouble accepting it. But I was ashamed and started starving myself to lose weight which obviously ended w me binging. I got into the habit of just accepting it finally and kinda just let myself go. I\u2019d come home from school, eat a microwave pizza, chips, candy, etc ANYTHING. And a few hrs later I\u2019d be eating dinner w my family. \n\n1 year went by and I got into a relationship w a man who made me love myself. I truly did. I stopped all the obsessive thinking and over the course of about 9 months, got down to 125. Body dysmorphia came along ofc. \n\nThings got rough my senior year &amp; I ended up being admitted to a psychiatric hospital where I was surrounded by counselors and doctors constantly. I was forced to face my deeply rooted issues head on. \nBut what helped me the most? Medicine. Yep! Sorry to any of you who aren\u2019t fond of \u201crelying\u201d on prescription drugs. But they helped. It was worth it, having been in the misery that I was. \nAs the meds started helping me, I naturally lost weight. I didn\u2019t suffer w emotional binges. I still binged only when I got the munchies... which is why I don\u2019t smoke weed anymore! \nAnyways, yes I still had BED. I talked to my psychiatrist and he prescribed me Vyvanse to help. Yes, the ADHD medicine. BUT it has been approved by the FDA for treating BED. And it helped, oh man did it help. I didn\u2019t even do anything besides take the pill everyday. I felt satisfied, ate how I wanted and didn\u2019t feel the need to binge anymore. Today I am 105. I can\u2019t tell you guys how proud I am. I NEVER imagined myself getting this far. I promise you.... YOU WILL GET THROUGH THIS! Stay strong and don\u2019t give up. Also look into Vyvanse to help. \n\nIf anyone wants help or to vent/ ask questions, feel free to do so.

I think about food constantly, whether it\u2019s binging or prolonging eating. \nI can remember stealing food from classmates backpacks in third grade, stealing candy from my moms cupboards (which were always fully stocked) and hiding wrappers, eating leftovers out of the trash, and other gross things like that. I\u2019ve ordered whole pizzas and felt so guilty after consuming half of it that I would chew and then spit the rest out. When I saw the sheer volume of food that I could have swallowed, I would purge and get rid of it all (but we all know it\u2019s never ALL gone). \nI gained 70 lbs with my first pregnancy, lost 20 pounds when he was born, and then gained it all back and maintained at about 240 lbs (I\u2019m 5\u20197) for about 2 years. I was depressed, in a bad marriage at 21 y.o, and didn\u2019t see any future, so I got divorced and began my weight loss journey. Within 8 months, I had lost 100 pounds and was so proud of myself for being healthy for the first time in my life...but looking back, it was just the other extreme. I was so terrified of calories that I would do anything to avoid eating. My family told me I ate like a bird because when I felt so pressured to actually eat dinner with them, I could only stomach a few bites. I told myself that I was just avoiding carbs and sugar, but I hardly ate anything at all. I even substituted my food addiction with alcohol, telling myself it was better to be drunk than fat.\nFast forward to my second pregnancy...I was in a new healthy relationship and didn\u2019t mean to get pregnant, but I felt so pressured to nourish the baby that I fell back into bad habits. Baby needs carbs, right? He needs me to eat 3 meals a day and snacks. I saw my weight increasing again and panicked...started using laxatives because food wouldn\u2019t make its way out of my system fast enough. When I got closer to 200lbs again, I started purging, telling myself that I never get it all out, so he\u2019s still getting some nutrients. After he was born, I was able to get within 10 lbs of pre-pregnancy weight by skipping dinner and exercising every chance I got. \nThen there\u2019s my third pregnancy, almost 2 years later. I never got back to healthy habits after the last one was born, so this pregnancy sent me back into binging/purging and laxatives almost from the start. I ended up developing high blood pressure and low blood sugar so we had to induce early. He\u2019s now 7 weeks old and I can\u2019t, for the life of me, get back into that mindset that carbs and sugar are what\u2019s stopping me from losing the last 30lbs of baby weight. 30 pounds may not be much to most people, and I\u2019ve lost it before (so it can\u2019t be that hard?) but this cycle of \u201cI just want to binge\u201d to \u201cI feel so guilty, I have to get rid of it\u201d is killing me. My stomach hurts when I do eat and my digestive system is so messed up that I can\u2019t have a BM without taking a laxative now, but that urge to binge is so overwhelming...and then the regret after eating anything is worse now than it\u2019s ever been. I can\u2019t think about anything else. I just want to enjoy my kids and be able to eat like a normal person. \nI apologize if this triggers anyone...I figured maybe telling my story can be my first step towards accountability, and maybe help someone else in the process.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Please don\u2019t read if any of these topics trigger you.)  \n\nHi everyone,\n\nPlease hear me out, I debated posting for a while and I just need an ear. First time posting here, but longtime lurker. \n\nI am a 29yr old woman, and I\u2019ve been through ED recovery about 8 years ago. I dealt with bulimia and with the help of a fantastic therapist at the time, I was able to get through 3 very dark years of my life.\n\nFast forward to today, I have been struggling for most of 2019. I go through phases of restricting and bingeing and overexercising. But never purging in the traditional sense. I went through a month of highly restrictive eating that I knew was bad for me, but I did it anyway. If I went over my calorie limit for the day even just a smidge, well it was time to go to the gym, or go for a run etc. Today, I caved and went ham on a full container of Oreos and a full bag of Doritos. Needless to say my stomach HURT. But instead of accepting it as a mistake and moving on, I fought hard with myself about whether or not to purge. \n\nAnd you know what? I did. And at the time, I thought I was doing the right thing, that I deserved this for being the way I am. And then, I felt shame. I felt fear. I thought I was past this, and I had it under control. In retrospect, I didn\u2019t. I am ashamed. I don\u2019t even know how to talk about this with my therapist. She knows I went into therapy for this, but apart of my body image, this hasn\u2019t really come up because I\u2019ve avoided the topic (my therapist is wonderful). Because I don\u2019t see myself as \u201cbad enough\u201d or \u201chow I was before \u201d and \u201cthat was a long time ago, you can\u2019t be going through this again\u201d. I spend an embarrassingly huge amount of time watching shows like My600lb life because I see myself as them. I see myself as a 600lb woman. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m sorry for the long post. I just needed an ear and some advice. Thank you, everyone, for hearing me out.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Got to just under 200lbs in middle school, dropped down to 150-ish during Freshman year of high school in probably the only healthy diet I've done. Watched my weight, tracked calories normally, exercised every day- looking back, it was really nice how easy and non-destructive this dieting period was.\n\nAnyway, since then I've gone through a ton of dieting/restricting/IF/bingeing, dysmophia you name it.\n\nMy lowest was two years ago when I found the keto diet. Starting at around 200lbs again, I dropped all carbs and started eating meats and cheeses and tried to bake a bunch of weird desserts to satisfy my sweet tooth. When I wanted to binge, I drank lite syrup from the bottle :/ As I kept on the keto, I learned about IF and only eating 1200 calories, which quickly turned into \"I'm not gonna eat for four days and when I do, I'll do 400 calories and make sure I walk for four hours so I burn 800 calories\". I dropped  My mom, who I blame for nearly all my eating and image problems as she'd always berate me about big I was and tell me I need to \"lose weight and be better\", started commenting about I was getting too thin. Whether it's good or bad, I ignored her and kept going on with what I was doing. No one really knew how poorly I was eating or what I was doing to myself. I dropped to 155 (lost 40 pounds) in three months. I still wanted to lose another 10 pounds but hit a wall and decided to give up a week or two before Easter.\n\nEaster day, I absolutely smothered myself in delicious candy. Jelly beans (my favorite!), Cadbury eggs, Reese's, Robin's eggs and all that bunny chocolate. After not having it for four months, it was like going to Heaven. It didn't take long for me to gain back 5 pounds, and I told myself I'd cut back. 5 pounds turned into 10 pounds turned into 20 pounds turned into me being back at almost 200 pounds again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut now, I'm at this weird point where I hate myself and my body but I don't hate it enough to change. I tell myself that I'm not gonna eat today, and then go make myself something for lunch and scrounge around for snacks. I don't binge as hard as I used to but I still feel just as bad after I eat.\n\nOn one hand, I'm glad that I'm not counting every single little calorie and obsessing over the numbers. And it's technically a good thing that I'm not starving myself like I used to do.\n\nBut at the same time, I don't want to weigh as much as I do. I wish my ED would kick back in and make me stop eating so I can shed all of this disgusting fat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyone else in the same boat?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Also went to a nutritionist for a semester last year and thought I finally conquered my eating.

Just being here right now and not being able to dance of my calories in that way makes me feel like I gained tons of weight already.

{"post_id": "dg0yh6", "created_utc": 1570726798, "title": "Anorexia, Depression, or Both?", "author": "claudiagraceloupoet", "self_text": "So here's the story:\n\nMy whole life I grew up with really bad eating habits as a result of a broken home (no one ever home so had to feed myself and brother) as well as southern American ignorance about nutrition (carbs on carbs on carbs with lots of gravy). So I was always overweight and then obese when I became a teenager. There has been a lot of binge eating in my life from my depression/anxiety and the need for control. I also have anxiety about eating in front of people and generally just don't. I was able to get down to a healthy weight during college by eating better and exercising (something I never had the opportunity to learn how to do growing up because of taking care of my family). Fast forward five years after college and I was right back to binge eating and being overweight/obese. This year I was put on an antidepressant and was able to control my binge eating. I've slimmed down TREMENDOUSLY and have been really proud of myself. Recently, I noticed that my supervisor (two years younger than myself at 27) has been telling me not to forget to eat, every single day and has shown frustration/concern when she finds out I haven't eaten. I think it's because she's noticed I don't eat at all during work, which I'm here from 7-6pm every day. I then began to realize that I wasn't really eating when I came home either. I get home at 7-7:30 and am in bed by 10. In between, I am watching tv or doing chores or hanging out with my roommate. When I go out with family/friends, I end up taking my food to go and barely touching it. Now, during all this, I know I've had thoughts when my stomach will growl like \"Just wait to eat until later because if you eat now and eat later you'll gain back all your weight.\" Then when I get home I think \"oh well, if I just get ready for bed and wake up I can have breakfast\" But then I don't eat breakfast either and the cycle repeats. I even lie to people (like my supervisor) when they ask what/if I've eaten recently.\n\nSorry for the extremely long post and thank you for reading this far. \n\nSo my question is: have I gone from one end of the spectrum to the other? Did I go from binge eating for 16ish years to not eating hardly at all and develop anorexia? Or is it just my depression? I love food so much, I mean my instagram is just food porn from restaurants or things I've cooked. Cooking is a passion of mine and since starting this medicine, I never cook. I know I'm not going to eat it so I just don't. I don't even WANT to eat. I literally have to force myself because I will feel weak or cranky and I'll know it's because in the course of a week, I'd have only eaten like some strawberries and maybe a stick of beef jerky or a handful of cashews. And only when I feel weak/dizzy do I do this. Also, I walk like 10 miles a day to and from the bus stop, work, etc. So I know I should be eating more than what is probably like 600 calories a WEEK. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother note I should make is that I recently left a toxic relationship and am pretty down about it. Mentally/emotionally, I'm fucked up over it. Telling myself that it was toxic and I deserve better so move on, find yourself and be happy. Yada yada yada.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, I'm done ranting now. If anyone has any input, please, I'd love to hear it.\n\nSincerely,   \nLost girl.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I was so absorbed and out of touch with reality that I completely ghosted my friends for three months. Due to that severe state of stress and anxiety, I  lost weight, along with my social life and what was left of my mental health. \n\nWhen I recognized that I had been able to lose weight without restricting, I felt relieved: I could eat pizza and ice cream without feeling guilty (also because my metabolism was skyrocketing) and binging. I was happy with my look and I thought I was magically recovered. \n\nAt the end of my exams I started seeing people again, after many days of prison, and *everyone* complimented me on my weight loss?!?!? My grandparents, uncle, friends... \"you look so good\", \"you're so thin now\", \"you look better now\".   \nThis means that they all thought that I looked fat and ugly when I was heavier and they all judged me back then. I bet they made comments between them when I was gaining weight.   \nI feel betrayed, humiliated and stupid that I dared to think I could be accepted by my loved ones even though I wasn't fit. \n\nMy mom, who used to hide biscuits and food from me (because when I weighted more I obviously didn't need to have breakfast), is now buying me ice creams. She's also making me compliments now, after three years of only judging looks at my body. \n\nLast week my roommate told me that her friend thought I became prettier. This was the last straw, I saw him twice last year and he's saying those things about me!  \n\nOf course, I relapsed hard.

This is my first post here, and I made this account for this purpose, so I apologize if I don\u2019t follow protocol. I added the TW just in case. I also apologize for posting a novel.\n\nTo provide some history, I\u2019m a 30-year-old female, and I think I probably had a restrictive eating disorder several years ago, though I was never diagnosed. I got down to an underweight BMI by dieting and exercising obsessively. Then, I just kept gaining and losing the same 5lbs, despite my efforts to lose more. I eventually started experiencing some concerning symptoms (e.g. chest pains and muscle spasms all over my body). I was worried, and I decided to try to ease my way back into eating normally. \n\nI started by increasing my daily calorie intake by 50 calories every week, and I decided that if I was going to gain weight, it would be better if it were muscle, not fat. So, I started lifting weights and doing less cardio. I managed to keep this up for month or two, but then I snapped and I just couldn\u2019t stop eating. I felt hungry all the time and I couldn\u2019t inhibit the urge to eat like I had in the past. \n\nI gained a lot of weight (35lbs) over the next year. Fortunately, I have good muscle building genetics, so a lot of it was muscle, but I definitely gained fat too. My weight was in the normal BMI range, but I felt fat and disgusting most of the time, despite being a beast in the gym.\n\nOver the next few years, I continued lifting, starting with bodybuilding and powerlifting, and transitioning to CrossFit. I would start cuts, intent on finally getting lean, but I was never able to tolerate hunger or control food like I had before. However, my body composition changed over time, becoming leaner at that same weight. I also continued tracking my calories/macros everyday, weighing all my food on a scale. \n\nAbout a month ago I finished an 8-week nutrition challenge at my gym. I signed up hoping it would provide the accountability and motivation I needed to finally get lean, and it worked. I lost 12lbs of mostly fat during the challenge, but I reawakened my ability to restrict food and worsened my food- and body-related thoughts (they never really went away). I think the gym staff became a bit concerned about me during the challenge because they said I was getting too lean, and the InBody scanner (which I don\u2019t trust at all) said I was 7% body fat. \n\nI said I would gain some weight back after the challenge to be healthier, but I can\u2019t bring myself to do it. I feel a desire to continue losing weight, but I haven\u2019t given in. According to the BMI scale, I\u2019m healthy. I weigh 140 at 5\u20198,\u201d though I know I\u2019m a lot leaner than that. I\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s unhealthy though. \n\nAnyway, this post was really long. If you read it, thanks. I\u2019d appreciate an outside perspective. Sometimes I think my thoughts and behaviors are a bit messed up, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s that bad. I\u2019ve also never heard of any other female having a similar experience and I look really muscular and fit.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

It was a diner populated heavily by the elderly and famous for having the best pie. I can\u2019t remember what I ate previously that day but I remember ordering some type of club sandwich because all of the salads looked horribly unappetizing and cheap. Obviously it shouldn\u2019t matter anyways. It came with a small french onion soup. I ate a lot of bread and crackers that were complementary, devoured my soup, but could only peck at my full plate when it arrived. I could feel my stomach stretch against my dance leotard and shorts. My body felt bloated and horrible and I wanted the food to be gone and at the same time let loose and eat as much as I possibly could as I was at a restaurant, something that happens not too often because of how poor I am. I opened up to my mom about how I\u2019ve been struggling lately with my eating. I want to restrict so bad. I am, but not as much as I would like and still maintain my binging habits. I don\u2019t like talking to my mother about these things, for a multitude of reasons as you might find out one way or another, but I was in such a needy position I needed to tell someone how I was doing, hoping to be met with comments saying that they have noticed and are worried because I am losing weight (I didn\u2019t get any).\n\nThere is no point in telling about our brief and lowly conversation so I am just going to jump to the bit when we are in the car, on our way to drop me off. My mom brings back up hospitalization and I say that I don\u2019t want to go back. I\u2019ve been on three separate occasions in the past 8 months all for depression, anxiety, and then ED. I get upset because I feel like whenever I struggle my family just wants to throw me back in.\n\nI chew on a tooth pick from the restaurant and, after some silence, say \u201cI\u2019m not going back. I don\u2019t even look sick.\u201d\n\nWith my last words my face contorted into a horrible figure and I started to sob like a child, the tooth pick hanging limply in my mouth. My mom parks in the usual spot and listens to me scream and sob for a good 10 minutes straight, without any words. I tell her that I feel horrible. I\u2019m not anorexic. That is my main fixation. I remember screaming and crying at the ED program that \u201cI get an eating disorder and I can\u2019t even lose the weight. I get the one that makes me ugly. I wish that if this was gonna happen then I at least got the one that would make me beautiful. I couldn\u2019t even do that right. I couldn\u2019t even lose the weight.\u201d\n\nI restrict and binge and eat normally and cycle through it constantly, tearing myself apart from the second I wake up to the very last moments before I go to sleep.\n\nMy mother tries to get me to go to dance and tells me that it will make me feel better but I won\u2019t stop screaming and shaking and crying. I can\u2019t remember how long its been but my mom gets me out of the car and I can\u2019t even walk. My legs hurt and tingle and my mom has to hold me up and escort me down the city to the building. But the closer we get the more my legs and ankles hurt and when we are just outside the door I start crying again. I can\u2019t think about looking in the mirror at myself with all those other girls that are skinnier than me. I can\u2019t stand the thought of acting like nothing happened when I feel so horrible and sad. My knees buckled and I almost fall to the ground screaming but because my mom already holds me by my shoulders because I could not walk on my own, she pulls me up before I hit the ground and tells me that I\u2019m not going to ballet today.", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

(Mention of body/body structure warning)", "author": "andwhyshouldi", "self_text": "Hey all,\n\nI developed anorexia last fall, plus some binge/purge behaviors, although mostly restriction/overexercising. My ED was never \"severe\": I wasn't hospitalized, I hit an underweight BMI over this past summer, but nothing below 17.5-18ish. I didn't look stereotypically anorexic, and I started off the whole thing at a BMI of 20ish, so I was pretty thin to start. I didn't think I actually had an ED because I felt like I was never good enough or had enough control for it to be an ED; I wasn't losing weight fast enough, I didn't have the control to stick to 500 calories a day, I couldn't not eat for more than 36 hours without nearly passing out. I thought I was just being healthy, exercising, eating better, etc. When I finally admitted it to myself and realized I probably needed to gain weight (amenorrhea), early in the summer, it started more binge behaviors. I would tell myself if I just binged now I would gain the 1-2 pounds I needed, then I could go back to eating \"normally\"/restriction.\n\nIn the end of August I ended up in proper therapy, although all outpatient- I've never been to and am unlikely to need a hospital. Anyway, recovery, while not easy, has been relatively smooth. The problem is I KNOW I'm gaining, I can tell from my thigh gap and the way my hips don't stick out the same among other things, and it's really getting to me because everyone is telling me I'm naturally going to eat as much as I need and so on, but I can't believe that \"as much as I need\" actually means my thighs touching at the top again or my stomach not being concave when I lie down. But I haven't been struggling to get to my calorie goals, not that I'm counting- I'm definitely eating more than enough. Realizing I've \"overeaten\" in the mental calculations of calories I allow myself triggers bingey behavior (like tonight- I haven't BINGED binged but it's been a lot closer than I would like to get to a binge and I'm panicking a little because my body is changing and I can't handle it).\n\nAnyway, my ultimate point is that I feel as though I don't deserve recovery/I need to be sicker in order to get better. Which I logically know is ridiculous. But I really want to restrict tomorrow morning, I feel like I'm out of control and eating everything in sight and I need to make up for it. How do you deal with this? I just feel like to have a real recovery or even a real ED I should be struggling more to eat enough each day, to not wildly overexercise, and so on. But I'm not really struggling like that, as I mentioned above. It's more mental/thoughts based.\n\nWhat if I gain so much that I weigh more than I did pre-ED? I fought so hard to get down to my lowest weight and now all that effort is going away, and I know I'll be healthier with a few more pounds- but I can't stomach gaining more than that. I just can't do it. Obviously I'm tired of having these thoughts, I just want the ED to go away but I also want to be able to look at my body in the mirror, to not compulsively calculate the calories in my food. I also struggle because I can't tell if I'm \"honoring my hunger\" or using it as an excuse to binge and otherwise overeat. Like, does my body actually need food or is my messed up brain just telling me I \"need\" it as part of recovery when I don't? I've had so much dessert today and it's just been a lot and I don't know what to do. I want to go to a nice restaurant this weekend and go out with one of my friends but I'm already planning mentally what to eat to have enough calories left over so I won't go over. I feel like if I put food on my plate I HAVE to eat it, even if I'm full, and I can't stop. I haven't been binge levels of disgustingly overfull, I've managed to not do that, but...\n\nI'm sorry for the absolute rambling, I just don't know what to do. Any words of wisdom would be appreciated. Because my ED has only been actively manifesting as restriction for about a year now I didn't really get involved in the ED communities so I'm not sure who to turn to or what to do, and I can hardly call my therapist every single day.\n\nAnyway, thank you all, and have a good night.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I've been doing my best to help her through it for the past few weeks, things like calming her down late at night and reasoning with her when she comes to me asking  \"whether she's eating too much\" etc. Anyway, I'm always the first person to immediately shut down anyone who proposes the idea people with eating disorders wanting attention, but I feel bad that I've started to think about it lately. Sometimes when she comes and talks to me, saying things like \"I know I should eat more lunch but I feel disgusting, what should I do?\", I see her smiling the tiniest bit like she's enjoying the conversation as I tell her how I'm very worried about her. She came up to me cheerily one day and  almost \"flaunted\" a list she had made on her phone the night before, planning out that she was supposed to eat pretty much nothing during the day. I would usually think of it as her overcoming her illness and reaching out for help, but she, again, was smirking and talking about it proudly. It seemed a lot like she wanted me to beg and cry at her feet to stop hurting herself. \n\nAnother friend of mine, (E) has gone through a really hard eating disorder in the past, and has helped A a lot so far. She has also confessed to me, and later to A, though, that hearing A talk about all of it is just triggering her and bringing her back. Even after all this, I saw A run up enthusiastically to E to show her the same toxic list that I had just spent a long time talking to her about.\n\nIt seems like I'm declaring confidently that A is just wanting attention, but that's just me letting out something I've been holding in for a while. A has had a lot of genuine, bad days that show that she's actually suffering with an eating disorder, plus I've seen her visibly lose weight. I know A is going through a hard time, but I don't want E to get hurt if A is just milking the sympathy we have for her. I'm going to keep doing everything I can to help A get better, but how do I know if she's only talking to me for attention and isn't actually taking my advice or trusting me? How do I know she's on her way to getting better?\n\nSorry this was a very long one. Im a little emotionally fatigued from holding it all in.\n\nTLDR: I feel guilty about it, but I think my anorexic friend might just be wanting attention, pretending to try to get better, and bringing my other friend down with her.

I feel it's pretty common for people with EDs to be interested in nutrition.\n\nScience, for the most part, tends to be a subject that isn't very opinion-based. Of course, we're learning more every day, but it's a pretty logic and evidence-based topic. But nutrition is a topic that is very debatable and appears largely opinion-based and subjective. Honestly, I can't think of a more controversial area of science short of the origins of the universe. Even then, after all I've read, I'm far more clueless on what is true in nutrition vs how the world came to be.\n\nEverywhere I look, there's something different. There's academic reports claiming caloric restriction is beneficial to health, but then there is evidence to suggest intuitive eating is superior for well-being. Some people believe in setpoint theory, some say it's all calories in vs calories out. Some say we should go on low-fat diets, some say carbs are what's bad for you. There seems to be an endless amount of unknowns in the realm of nutrition.\n\nSo why? Why do we not know anything? Why is there evidence to suggest one thing followed by evidence that suggests the exact opposite? As someone who is very interested in natural sciences and with a brain that relies on facts, it bothers me to no end that (from what I've seen) there is little known about nutrition. This drives my eating disorder crazy. It makes me wonder if bulimia is actually no worse than following a standard unhealthy diet - so many medical professionals have different opinions, is any of it really trustworthy?\n\n... Anyways, I'm not sure if this is more of a discussion starter or just a rant. Regardless, feel free to chime in with your own thoughts and experiences.

Literally, stick thin. Her BMI was around 15 but she didn\u2019t have an eating disorder or anything, she was just thin, because she was a dancer. She was picky about food too, and she hated vegetables. She wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of fruit either. but she could eat a whole box of pizza by herself and she ate a lot of junk food too, she liked lays, ruffles, doritos, all of those. We always had mcdonalds drivethru too. She was so thin that the people in her class made fun of her and called her \u201canorexic\u201d and made her feel bad about herself for being skinny. She hated it but she just couldn\u2019t gain weight at that time. Now, she\u2019s already working, and she gained weight, but she still eats what she wants, whatever time she wants, and her BMI is still around 18. She\u2019s very glad about her weight and wants to gain more. But she isn\u2019t gaining weight even if she eats junk. She often eats KFC, pizza, or pasta during her lunch break out of convenience. Instead, she\u2019s losing more weight. I think she lost 2kg after a few weeks of working. She doesn\u2019t exercise because she doesn\u2019t have time. She eats at around 11 pm then goes straight to bed despite being full.\n\nMy mom, on the otherhand, is also skinny. She used to have a 23-inch waist. She eats a lot. She snacks a lot too. But now that she\u2019s older, she\u2019s around 50kg at nearly 5\u20193\u201d. It\u2019s so weird to me because I observed her eating patterns, but they\u2019re kind the same everyday, but she just doesn\u2019t gain weight. She probably eats/snacks like 5 times a day. She also eats A LOT of rice. She doesn\u2019t really exercise too. Only house chores. Once, I remember, she ate 3 doughnuts (maybe 300~400 calories each) and a milktea (around 300~400) calories each. She had breakfast, lunch, and dinner that day too. I think she also ate different snacks, but I don\u2019t remember what. I saw her eat all those for that day. But when she weighed herself the next morning, her weight didn\u2019t move at all! I was like ??? How is this possible ??? She also doesn\u2019t care much about her weight, eats intuitively, and always tells me to eat. I wish I could be that free with my eating.\n\nMy dad is also skinny. His thighs are skinnier than mine. \n\nWhy is everyone in my family skinny but me??? My BMI is 19 something. I look at my family and wonder why I\u2019m the only fat Asian in this family?? They eat intuitively and don\u2019t think twice about eating an extra cookie but I can\u2019t even eat anything without torturing my mind over it and compensating for it by exercising for hours. Im jealous. \n\nI know that \u201cfast metabolisms\u201d dont really exist but why do the people in my family have \u201csmall frames\u201d no matter what they eat/how much they eat?

It hurts thinking about how much money I've wasted on things that only affected me negatively.\n\nOver 6 years of bingeing/straight up food addiction:\n\n1. Thousands spent on fast food, take out, delivery, groceries to make my favorite binge foods for food that had no health value and just dug me deeper into the weight gain/mental/physical health hole I'd have to climb out of eventually\n\n\\~$400 a month, for 6 years: $28,800 (this is a super conservative estimate, my fellow BEDs know what's up)\n\n2) Thousands lost in the form of a full ride, all expenses paid (with a bunch of extra spending money too) scholarship I had for school because I became a food monster who couldn't do or think about anything except eating. All my mental bandwidth was occupied with food and I stopped going to classes, stopped studying, skipped exams to eat/be in a post-binge coma... and lost my scholarship because it was merit-based and dumb girls who fail all their classes don't get to have those.\n\n\\~$110,000 (it was a public school)\n\n3) Thousands lost in potential earnings, first because I had to spend an extra year in school to finally scrape enough credits together for my degree, and next because I could have gotten way more money easily if I hadn't self-destructed my academic career\n\n\\~$160,000 (I work in a really well paid industry and while I made six figs my first year, I could have easily made this much if I wasn't such a hot mess)\n\n4) Thousands more lost in potential earnings, when I started working and completely neglected my job because all I wanted to do was eat, eat, eat and because I had horrible self-esteem, ability to concentrate, and anxiety, couldn't speak to my co-workers or manager, couldn't speak up in meetings. I missed out on bonuses, stock awards, and a whole 1.5 years of additional earnings because I had to go on mental-health leave otherwise lose my job for sucking at it so badly\n\n\\~$225,000 (this sounds like a lot, but is actually a pretty low/realistic estimate, bc this is a super lucrative industry like I said)\n\n5) Thousands spent on shopping because since I've limited my binge eating (for the last 10 months yay me) I've picked up other easy dopamine-rush activities, mainly shopping. I'd rather shop than binge, so it's an improvement, but my mental health is so fucked and I apparently can't have hobbies, interests, or a social life like a normal person; nope only easy-pleasure rushes for me! Also I've only been buying clothes I can't wear, either really nice formal wear or just normal clothes, but all of them in sizes WAY smaller than I currently am. Because it didn't \"make sense\" to buy clothes that were just going to be too big once I reached my goal weight. Which yeah, I'm half-way towards, but is still stupidly optimistic and doesn't even take into account that these clothes still might not fit right because sizing for women is so unreliable)\n\n\\~$25,000\n\n= $548,800 richer I could be right now if it weren't for food\n\nNot to mention all the other things that I've lost because of this addiction, all of them priceless and worth way more than money. The greatest man I'll ever meet, who somehow loved me. My mental health. All the years of my twenties so far that should have been happy. My college years.

(I take around 20k steps at work + kinda have to do at least 8-10k more, the more the better).\n\nAnd I'm so tired of it all. Tired of walking the neigborhood in the evening, tired of salad, tired of feeling tired/worn out. Yet, I can't seem to change a thing/don't do anything. I keep telling myself 'Oh, i'll eat something when I get home' but I know how I don't even consider getting the minimum amount of healthy intake, often not even my BMR. I just feel like I've given up on myself and just wait for a catastrophe to happen. \n\nMy boyfriend repeadetly tells me how I keep dropping to a really low side of \"good\" considered for my height/body type and points out where I've gotten thinner and I just shrug it off and can't bring myself to care. When I compared pictures of me at my HW and now I just got disguisted at the \"before\", yet can't see that much of a difference. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry this comes off as confusing and incoherent.

In general, I believe in natural diversity of body size and set point theory. Body size or AT LEAST the tendency to gain fat has a strong genetic component. I also believe in intuitive eating as an alternative approach to health. (Fight me all you want, but there is research support for both of these things. )\n\nTHAT BEING SAID. I get so fucking sad and bitter watching these recovery youtubers that appear to be able to eat a shit ton of calories and maintain a low/normal weight. Not even being on a weight gain plan but the way they are and expect to continue to eat indefinitely. Eating at restaurants all the time, having these decadent meals/snacks, and claiming to not compensate. They say that you can do this and when you reach your body's set point you can follow your hunger cues and it will be easy to maintain your weight. Okay fine, I believe you, but for those of us with a personal and family history of obesity, our bodies aren't necessarily going to level off at a BMI of 20 or 22 or even 25.  And I can't cope with that. So don't say recovery \"won't make you fat\" because for some of us it could.\n\n I'm not saying this to disparage these women or their recovery journeys, but it would be nice to see recovery from the viewpoint of someone who is not thin and gorgeous. Even Stephanie Buttermore, who gained 35 pounds going \"all in\" still looks fucking amazing with her body proportions. In HS when I began binge eating after anorexia I gained 100 fucking pounds and I was miserable and unhealthy.

I ended up putting on some muscle, and thought things were getting under control, even though I'd started obsessing over food.  \n\n At this point I wasn't labeling what was happening to me, as I hadn't had any problems with disordered eating in the past.

Part of that is obviously the FOOD, which I ate plenty of during the first couple of weeks when I was with my company.  So I thought, maybe everything is back to normal?  But then I had 10 days of solo travel, and things started getting a little messy.  Though there were so many things I wanted to eat, I stopped letting myself eat them.  I did eat some days, but definitely not enough.\n\nNow that I'm back in the states, things are getting even worse.  I've started fasting two days a week, and restricting on the days I do eat.  I'm trying to find justification to call this an eating disorder.  It just cropped up out of seemingly nowhere, and has only lasted for the past few months.  Plus it seems to recede at times...

I got tits and hips. Though my bmi did rise to 32 briefly after I sustained an injury I'm still dealing with.    \nLosing a little was a healthy thing to do.   \nShortly after I started I fell into a spiral of bad experiences and I just quit eating (that had never been so easy. 20 years of ed and suddenly it was easy.) I scared myself and went to my gp quite fast.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI never wanted to be thin. I just really wanted to be healthy.

That still makes me wanna destroy my body.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI was at a dinner party today. When I walked in one of the girls looked at my body and asked if I had been losing weight.

Not doubt if I want to starve to death or feed myself fat.

(tw ana and some mia mentioned)", "author": "Al_sz", "self_text": "I've struggled with food my entire life. When I was in elementary school I refused to eat breakfast, the thought of it just made me nauseous. I would eat a little bit of my dinner and say I was full but my parents literally spoon fed me to get me to finish it all. around 5th grade and onwards I would never eat my lunch, sometimes I would just leave it in my backpack and it would go bad and I would get yelled at when my parents found it. I eventually started just throwing them away later on instead of leaving it in my bag. But then 7-8th grade I did really have too much of a problem with lunch but I was still the same about breakfast. Shifting over to high school, I still had the skipping breakfast habit when I could get away with it without anyone noticing but I barley ever ate lunch, like very very rarely. The end of high school I fell into the trap of purging even though I would only be eating like one meal a day, anything that ate I would throw up. I got bad pretty bad, like to the point when food was all I thought about and it was just pretty obvious I was driving into eating disorder territory BUT I wasn't underweight (because I was extremely athletic I built up a lot of muscle mass). Then all of a sudden  I kind of just stopped, which doesn't make sense to me at all. I went on a week long trip to Jamaica with my family and I never had a moment to be alone so I couldn't purge, but I was eating lunch and dinner at least and it wasn't completely horrible, sometimes I was close to breakdown but other times I was kind of fine. Then after that trip I don't think Ever purged again, and I think my eating went back to normal for a bit (minus breakfast of course). And now here we are in present day where I have stared the habit of eating one meal a day again. Sometimes its on purpose but other times I am either not hungry or I forget to eat. Ive lost a bit of weight, and ever time I see someone they tell me I look to skinny which is quite annoying frankly. For a while I was consumed consciously trying to lose weight, like weighing myself and watching the numbers go down but as of right now I haven't weight myself in a long time. Right now part of me wants to keep losing weight, like I don't see it as a problem and I keep saying im not activity trying to but I also feel like that's a lie. My therapist asked how my eating had been so I told her I was basically down to one meal a day and during that conversation she mentioned anorexia and how its the most deadly illness and blah blah blah, but like I don't think Im anorexic like at all. I feel like maybe I just have a weird relationship with food. Anyways sorry I literally spilled my whole life story out here, I guess I just wanted to hear outside perspectives on this because Im genuinely curious to know how other people see it. \n\ntldr; Ive had a bad relationship with food all my life. Recently only been eating one meal a day but I do snack sometimes. Not continuously trying to lose weight sometimes but also at the same time I do kind of want to.

My uncle is morbidly obese, one of my cousins has suffered from bulimia in the past (I still do) and most of my relatives struggle with compulsive overeating. \n\nWe haven't really seen him since he started losing. Today my mom asked him if he likes to eat vegetables (she's obsessed with weightloss). He said he preferred not eating at all because he doesn't like vegetables that much and he can't stop eating once he starts. He seemed a little sad even.

(TW numbers and fasting)", "author": "recovering-me", "self_text": "So I just wanted to fucking share what\u2019s going on cause maybe if I write it down in one place I can get myself out of my head. \n\nLast semester I hit a really low place depression wise, I wanted to drop out of college, but my parents convinced me to just drop to half time. \n\nMy mom went around looking for group support in my area and just happened to find an group program specializing in EDs. I had never really considered myself as having an ED before. I have been overweight or obese my entire life. I think I had like a 6 month period in middle school where I was on the high end of normal. But I have almost always been classified as obese.  \n\nAnyway I went for the intake interview, and it went well and basically I started thinking for the first time in my life that maybe I could classify myself as someone with an ED. The program was intensive outpatient, 4 days a week for 4 hours a day with a meal included. And oh my fucking god I don\u2019t think I have ever worked on myself and my health for that long. Being in a group environment, with people of all shapes, sizes, EDs, and stages of life, really put things into perspective. I had been struggling with binge eating recently, but I had definitely had binge restrict cycles in the past. Hearing from so many people all the thoughts I thought about myself was amazing. We all had the same shit going on, but coped with it in different ways. Anyways that\u2019s not what this post is about, but it\u2019s important background info, I was at this program for the rest of the spring semester and most of the summer before the fall semester started. \n\nWell now I have a new major, in a new school (I transferred) and everything has been going pretty great. Iv been mostly following meal plan and losing weight in a slow and sustainable way. From my highest point 5\u20196\u201d 215lbs, I\u2019d gotten down to about 205. \n\nAnd then all of a sudden what feels like from fucking no where I started fasting. I have never been someone who fasts. I missed lunch one day by accident and it kinda just spilled into a 48hr fast. I was like ok, that\u2019s weird but not a problem. Then the next week I had another \u201caccidental\u201d 60 hr fast. Food just feels so hard all of a sudden and I\u2019m down to 192 which is amazing for me but I know I\u2019m not being \u201chealthy\u201d. \n\nYesterday I was over at my boyfriends (we have been together 1 year, he knows about SH and ED a bit but doesn\u2019t really know what to say or how to handle it) and it was such a thing that I couldn\u2019t eat anything but dinner and he made me have what felt like a huge dinner when I know it was a normal amount of food. \n\nAnyway, now I\u2019m up before him typing on reddit while he sleeps and I\u2019m just so stressed about today because he said he was going to make me eat \u201cnormal\u201d today and I don\u2019t want to make a fuss but I also really really really don\u2019t feel like eating like a normal human being. Anyway that\u2019s my rant.  I\u2019m in a hole of food anxiety and I needed to share.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

And to preface this, no one knows I have an eating disorder but some family members may suspect it. I told a good close friend I\u2019ve known all my life about it drunkenly a few wks ago and she\u2019s the only one I\u2019ve ever disclosed this to). \n\nSo anyways. I posted something completely unrelated to this forum in a different subreddit and it got pretty popular and shit. I jokingly was telling my BF that I\u2019m kind of a big deal bc I got a hot post on reddit rn. So he starts questioning and wanting to know what it was. Me, taking reddit very seriously (lol), refused to disclose any info abt it other than a vague summary about what it was so that he couldn\u2019t find out my reddit profile. This is stupid but I love reddit and feel incredibly vulnerable on here having my identity exposed. I\u2019m sure this is the case w most reddit users. \n\nSo I keep it vague. Then I sent him a screenshot from a funny subreddit I follow of something another person had posted in. He then is like \u201c can we be friends on reddit? Is that a thing?\u201d And he says \u201cyou have a weird username\u201d and I was like \u201cI know lol\u201d but deep down my heart sunk bc I was so worried he\u2019d found my account. Turns out he thought I was the person who had posted in that subreddit community that I\u2019d sent the pic in. \n\nThankfully he didn\u2019t have the correct account and therefore doesn\u2019t know my reddit username after all but it had me scared and worried. So before I found out that he had the wrong username for what he thought was me, I panicked and wanted to delete my reddit. I comment on things in subreddits abt EDs and such and didn\u2019t like the fact I felt exposed. I jokingly was like \u201cya we can be friends on reddit what\u2019s your username\u201d so that I could block him on here lmao I know that may sound nuts but aaaanyways... \n\nI told him I only asked his username so I could block him etc etc and realized how defensive and sketchy I must\u2019ve appeared. So i started to think abt how this must feel or sound from his perspective and felt guilty so I decided to come clean. \n\nI told him \u201clet\u2019s just say it has something to do with eating\u201d. He was confused and said \u201cyou\u2019ll have to explain later\u201d or something. Then I was just kinda ready to rip the bandaid and go ahead and say it. So I basically did and I sat in his bed at his house by myself (he\u2019s at work) and cried. Bc I felt ashamed and embarrassed and exposed. \n\nBut his response was the sweetest most caring and loving thing ever and now I\u2019m crying again bc it just makes me feel good but also sad. He said we will talk about it later in person and I said I didn\u2019t really want to or not anytime soon atleast and he understood and said he didn\u2019t want to offend me and feels bad for not knowing what\u2019s going on with me personally and that he wants to know and cares but he also completely understood when I told him I\u2019d rather not talk about it today or anytime soon. This was the worst but also maybe the most calm/chill way to disclose this to him or anyone. Idk. Mixed feelings. Sorry for the long rant I just wanted to vent and get this off my chest. Thanks for reading\u2665\n\nTL;DR: I thought my BF found my reddit username/acct and was super sketchy and anxious abt having my reddit anonymity revealed bc I\u2019m active on ED forums and he doesn\u2019t know I have one. Ended up telling him about my ED and he was super caring and loving.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

After in-patient, I ended up in a partial program for adults with mood disorders. In doing my assessment, staff were like, \"hmmmmmmmmmm this person should be cross-tracked with our ED program.\" Well, since cross tracking, my urges to restrict and purge have been off the charts. The body image classes and the meal plans and the blind weighing have all been a little too much for me. It's like the spotlight is on my body weight and shape now and I just want to hide it all. I hadn't purged since April, but was struggling pretty hard with binging, with no compensatory behaviors, but I just purged after eating a shit ton of homemade biscotti.   \n\n\nI am trying to determine what triggered this specific instance (even though my ED voice is like, let's just not address this). My treatment voice is correcting me even as I write this next part saying \"there's no such thing as good food or bad food\" but I had watched a bunch of healthy/clean eating meal prep videos this morning and I started to feel bad about the food that's in my apartment right now. I feel like none of it is nutritious or vegetable-based, even though that isn't even true, I have fruits, veggies, whole grain options, etc... When I've been in healthier places in my life with food, I've always had a lot of vegetables within my reach. I don't really have any money to grocery shop because I'm not working because of treatment and my partner lost his job and the things we do have are sweet potatoes, bananas, strawberries, and spinach, and onions. I'm also overwhelmed with all the choices I have to make in order to follow my meal plan (assigned by my dietitian--it's very flexible, it just has the number of servings of food groups I should be eating). I want to just intuitively eat, but clearly that doesn't work for me, as I am where I am now. This meal plan is very carb heavy and I'm eating whole grains but I still feel like there are not enough fruits and veggies on it (there's one serving of fruits OR veggies for each meal...doesn't that seem like not enough??). Maybe I'm just making excuses. It shouldn't be this hard to survive, it shouldn't be this hard to eat.

I started to research new and/or alternative approaches to treating eating disorders, and I came across a couple of centres that have recently opened which will be running clinical trials to test whether psilocybin (the active compound in magic mushrooms) can be effectively used to treat anorexia nervosa (e.g. [Johns Hopkins](https://hopkinspsychedelic.org/anorexia) are leading it in the USA, and [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/psychedelic-research-centre/research/?respub-action=search.html&amp;id=1063&amp;limit=5&amp;iminyear=&amp;imaxyear=&amp;itypes=&amp;_type=on&amp;keywords=&amp;page=1) are leading it in the UK). This is building on previous research which found that psilocybin is effective for helping people to recover from treatment-resistant depression. \n\nIt seems obvious to me that the intense and transformative potential of psychedelics could be exactly what my sister needs to change her mindset, so I think I should recommend to her that she contacts the facilities to try to sign up for the trial. However, we've never really spoken in any depth about the nature of her illness and I really struggle to understand it, and I'm worried that I might be over-stepping if I encourage her to try this. I don't even know if she wants to recover, for example. \n\nSo, as somebody who currently has or formerly had an eating disorder, how would you have reacted to the idea of treating your illness with psychedelics? Would you have been excited by the idea of an experience so powerful that it has the potential to change your mindset completely and alter your relationship with anorexia, or is that the sort of thing that you'd actively resist?", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

If it touches me I\u2019m going to absorb it and become hydrated, which is my biggest fear. I\u2019ve had kidney stones, chronic low potassium, constant heart palpitations, blah blah blah. \n\nThis obviously gets addressed in treatment. In my past two programs I did okay. But this year I\u2019m bad enough in my ED, and my OCD has never been this severe in my life. I\u2019m absolutely paralyzed by it. I cried all day today about having to couch the couches that people were putting their shoes on. Why would you do that??? They expect me to touch it??\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m horrified.

This is the absolute dumbest story ever but I hope it makes you feel a bit better about any binges you\u2019ve had recently.\n\nI get home from the gym last night after a great workout. I take a shower, go to meet some friends, and then I come home to go to sleep. I had eaten nothing after my workout as I had reached my limit in calories for the day. But once I get home, I am suddenly ravenous. \n\nDetermined not to eat any real food, I reach into my cabinet to take my daily servings of gummy vitamins. Two different bottles of two different types of gummies for two different purposes.\n\nExcept I don\u2019t just have one serving of each. I reach for more. It\u2019s like a part of my brain was activated, a switch was flipped, and I went into \u201ceat until you\u2019re sick\u201d mode. For vitamins, both gummy types were pretty high in sugar. But my disordered eating ass, who has refused to touch any candy or desserts for 5 years, is okay with them because they\u2019re \u201cvitamins\u201d. And a total of 6 grams of sugar (3 grams for one vitamin, 3 for the other) isn\u2019t the WORST. Right?\n\nWell, yeah, in moderation. But one more serving becomes one more serving which becomes JUST one more serving. Before I know it, I\u2019m rapidly eating both gummy vitamins by the HANDFUL. Within a few minutes, both bottles are empty.\n\nI\u2019ve just consumed 60 servings of gummy vitamins.\n\nI first calculate the amount of calories this sets me back. 1200. And 180 calories of sugar.\n\nYikes. But then I start to wonder? Why the hell did I not think of possible negative effects besides weight gain?? Vitamins are supposed to be eaten by the serving, not the bottle. And 2 bottles and 60 servings is absolutely not recommended \n\nI take to Google to find out if my life is in danger.\n\nI find an article that says that \u201ca few more servings than normal likely won\u2019t kill you\u201d, but that \u201cto consume a bottle of 30 is a horrible idea\u201d and that toxicity was entirely possible, especially with fat-soluble vitamins. Looking at my bottle of Vitamin E gummies, I gulp, knowing that they aren\u2019t going to be peed out any time soon and could very well \u201cpermanently damage\u201d my body, as the article said. I was a bit less worried about my B vitamin gummies but even then, too many vitamins (especially 60x the recommended serving) is never good.\n\nPanicking, I rush to the toilet and start to make myself throw up. It\u2019s painful and disgusting and, as I have no history of bulimia, very difficult. I retch for about 10 minutes until I start to hit food. By now, I can only hope the vitamins have all left my body.\n\nWith hope not being enough for me, I call Poison Control. I break down sobbing at how much of a mess I am and I explain what happened between tears and sighs. The lady is extremely kind to me and very understanding. I tell her I\u2019m in therapy for severe depression and disordered eating and she recommends I tell my psychiatrist and psychologist about what happened.\n\nOh yeah, and she says I\u2019m safe.\n\nPro-tip: if this ever happens to you (which I DO NOT RECOMMEND it do), the real risk is if the gummy vitamins contain iron, which mine thankfully did not.\n\nAfter breaking down crying from relief and sadness and frustration, I hang up and make a note to call my psychiatrist.\n\nNeedless to say, I will be inquiring about possibly being prescribed Vyvanse in our next session.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I don't always have the clearest perspective on how I'm doing or what's normal.\n\nStarted two psychotropic medications to deal with a new diagnosis of bipolar 2, and effortlessly lost maybe 50 pounds since January.  Food stopped interesting me, meat in particular made me feel uncomfortable, and I started just eating one real meal a day, mostly vegetarian.

Sorry if this isn\u2019t the done thing here but I want to know the answer so I can get help if needed. Sorry it's a long post. I'll delete it if it's not right for this sub.\n\nI developed an unhealthy relationship with food in like 2014 as I started binging to cope with various stresses in my life at the time. I had always been an average weight but then I became overweight and embarrassed of my body. \n\nIn Jan 2016 I\u2019d had enough, so I started restricting to 1200 and lost the excess that I\u2019d gained. And I kept going because I liked the progress. I found pro-ED communities online. By the summer I knew I was obsessing too much, falling into a bad pattern of restricting heavily whenever I ate over my calorie limit. I was binging about once a month, and torturing myself for it each time.   \nI went home for christmas 2016 and my parents commented that I looked too thin. That was my lowest ever weight, not underweight but definitely the happiest I\u2019ve ever felt about my body.\n\nIn early 2017 I met someone who has become my long term partner. Over time I felt more comfortable and I started eating \u2018normally\u2019 with him. I panicked so much as the weight crept back on. I would try to go back to my 1200 but he would express concern and fear and anger so I'd stop.\n\nThroughout 2017 and 2018 I maintained an \u2018average\u2019 weight. I\u2019d have periods of persuading myself that I was okay, that my body was fine, that I was attractive and I liked myself.... And then I\u2019d relapse about once a month and convince myself I had to restrict, I\u2019d obsess over thinspo every day, I\u2019d feel light headed at work but keep pushing on through\u2026 until I lost motivation or my partner would have a concerned talk with me and I\u2019d have to stop and go back to \u2018normal\u2019 eating.\n\nThose cycles have gotten worse. My self esteem is now better than it\u2019s ever been thanks to building good relationships with my partner and friends. However it was my low self esteem that always inspired and motivated my restrictive eating, so now I feel better about myself I don\u2019t have that same drive to restrict.\n\nSo the binge cycles have been much worse ever since the start of 2019 - lasting a couple of weeks or more and featuring a stupid amount of secretive eating. I have not gained a lot, but enough to make me constantly uncomfortable with my appearance and I\u2019ve started wanting to hide in baggy clothes again. The self esteem I have learned just complicates the issue, as I flit back and forth between thinking I\u2019m cute and feminine and curvy, to thinking I\u2019m chunky and disgusting. Sometimes I\u2019ll be fine with myself one day and disgusted the next. Sometimes I even think both extremes simultaneously, and I feel like I\u2019m going mad.\n\nI relapsed today and looked at thinspo for the first time in like four months. I think what\u2019s been happening is that ever since Jan 2019, I\u2019ve been in a cycle of losing weight to a point where I\u2019m more comfortable, then doing what I think is \u2018recovery\u2019 but is really just me eating whatever I want with no restrictions. Then panicking when I gain a few pounds, and restricting again. \n\nI genuinely had myself convinced that I was recovered. That my phases of eating whatever I wanted was \u2018recovery\u2019 and a \u2018normal\u2019 way of eating. But today I suddenly had a moment of realisation, and I\u2019m not sure it is. I think it\u2019s just a binge/restrict cycle, only played out over months instead of days or weeks.\n\nI never was officially diagnosed. I just know that I think way too much about food: either I want it or I'm afraid of it. And I know that I\u2019m never fully happy with my appearance. I'm beginning to think it\u2019ll never go away. Restricting is the only way I know that's *proven* to make me feel better.\n\nCan anyone relate? Do you think I have an ED and should get help, or do you think I'm just an emotional eater?

While there, I was diagnosed with BPD and was receiving ED support for anorexia (which I've struggled with since the age of 6), but since I've returned home my ED's spiralled even further. The thing is, I was actually supposed to go to ED treatment instead of rehab but things got complicated when treatment refused me due to the severity of my addiction issues, and then rehab originally refused then eventually agreed to take me under strict conditions because they deemed my ED too acute for their facility. In the end, I attended/completed rehab with ED support and once I got out I actually had some high hopes for my recovery. However, things aren't going as planned and although I really did intend on following my meal plan, things are really spiralling and I'm feeling super alone and vulnerable. Rationally, I know my weight is pretty low and everyone keeps commenting nervously about how thin I am, but body dysmorphia's being a major bitch and won't let me see the severity of the situation. \n\nI guess my biggest struggle right now is staying sober/clean while trying to manage an acute ED, and I guess this is where I'm looking for support. I've spent the last 3 months in the psych ward rehab, so being back out in the world has been quite the shock. Before I left rehab, it was agreed with my care team there that to maintain my sobriety, I'll have to maintain my weight because any gains would send me straight back into my addiction. This sounded like a good idea at the time, but now I'm realizing what a slippery slope this actually is. I've already had a few slips addiction-wise since I got home and I can feel my self-damaging BPD behaviours creeping in, too. I want to sabotage my last few relationships, I want to use and do dumb/impulsive things, etc... On top of that, this weekend was Canadian thanksgiving and as I'm sure you all know how hellish holidays can be for those of us with EDs. In saying this, I can feel my ED kicking into an even higher gear.\n\nAll in all, I guess I came here looking for some support for dealing with concurrent disorders.  I'm being pressured to go to ED treatment if I can maintain my sobriety for 3-4 months, and I know treatment is the only hope I have for ED recovery but honestly after the hell they put me through these past few months, I don't really want to commit to their program. When I went to rehab, I expected to come out with zero addiction (substance and behavioural) symptoms, but now that I'm out I couldn't have been more wrong. Is anyone facing similar struggles?

When I asked how that was medically possible (I know they could've died from a whole host of other things -- vitamin deficiency, electrolyte imbalance, damage from purging -- and she even admitted that \"maybe that's not what was on the death certificate\" but she knew it was actually starvation) she just told me that starvation makes the human body do crazy things. When I asked how it was possible for someone to starve to death, then, she just shrugged and said the same thing. \n\nIt's really impacting my work with her. One of the most upsetting things for me about my first attempt at inpatient recovery (she was the one who talked me into treatment in the first place) was that they told me things like that that weren't true. I don't want to put my health (and my weight!) in the hands of someone who's misinformed and unwilling to change that. I'm supposed to see her again today and I feel like I can't take anything she says seriously because if she's willfully ignorant about this, what else is she going to tell me that's not true?\n\nShe also says she can't really work with me until I see a psychiatrist and get back on meds, which I'm not willing to do. I'm so tired of doctors and getting on and off of new medications. I've been doing it since I was seven and nothing ever works. At best it does nothing, at worst it lands me in the hospital.

Some have had full blown AN, while others have just lost an extreme amount of weight or engaged in overly \"healthy\", restrictive behaviours before transitioning into BN.\n\nBasically, to me, it seems to work like this: first the person starts restricting and loses weight (or doesn't - but still restricts most of the time, either quantitatively or qualitatively). Then, at some point, binges happen as a natural reaction. Then the person freaks out and starts purging to undo the effects of the binge. Binges then become more frequent as a reaction to purges, which in turn also become more frequent as a reaction to the more frequent binges. A behavioural pattern is then established and becomes more and more ingrained - Bulimia!\n\nI have yet to know about people who just started binging out of the blue and **then** started purging. And it seems to me that most therapies against Bulimia involve stopping restriction at first by a) ensuring constant nutrition to reduce the risk of binges and b) reducing the frequency of purges to allow the body to retain calories.\n\nOpinions?", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Wearing 2 pairs of spanx to school each day.

My college was more diverse than my high school in terms of bodies. I was really starting to feel good about myself. I was letting myself eat too. Then, I started to gain weight like crazy. 10 pounds in a week. Then 40 in a couple of months. I wasn\u2019t doing anything different. I\u2019d expected to gain a few and honestly I\u2019d looked somewhat sick in high school, so becoming a healthy weight would have been expected. This was swollen, puffy, weird horrible weight. After years of begging doctors to help, I was diagnosed with Hashimoto\u2019s (basically my thyroid had gone kaput). I\u2019m 5\u201911 and had gone from 165 lbs to 240lbs in about a year. The scale wasn\u2019t moving down and I\u2019d spend hours in the gym, wouldn\u2019t eat anything all day, and still would gain. I turned to laxatives and vomiting. This random weight gain had only perpetuated the ED I\u2019d had in high school. After starting my thyroid pills in 2018, I lost about 25 pounds in a few months without doing anything different. Since then, I\u2019ve tried so many diets and exercises and still nothing really moves. I did keto for a month and moved down to about 210, but I binged twice last week and am 217 as of today. I sobbed on the floor. I\u2019m in therapy for this. But I can\u2019t find any support anywhere for someone who struggles with an ED but who actually does need to lose weight. I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t want to be this weight. And it\u2019s not ridiculous for me to say that. I\u2019m overweight. Medically. Clinically. My doctors want me to lose weight. But I still suffer from an ED. I don\u2019t know what to do. All the advice I find is \u201clet yourself eat, it\u2019s ok to gain, you\u2019ll look better with meat on your bones.\u201d I don\u2019t need any more meat on my bones. I\u2019m sorry if this is scattered, I\u2019m crying. Anyone help, please, I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I miss being myself.

As a child, my parents never allowed me to have treats or snack foods, so the first time I found out about them,  I became instantly obsessed. I've always felt that I have an abnormal attraction to food. I can even remember my first real binge when I was maybe 8 years old- we went to a family reunion and I stole a package of cookies from the picnic table.  I hid behind a tree, inhaled them, and then threw up black chocolate marshmallow cookies all over the place.  I feel like this marks the beginning of my binge eating saga. \nNow flash forward to 40 years old, and I still feel that I have to sneak food to truly enjoy it. I hide in the bathroom to eat pastries or anything considered unhealthy. I hide wrappers or stuff them deep in the trash can. I hide receipts that include guilt laden foods so my husband won't know. I act confused about why I haven't lost any weight even though it appears that I try really hard. But I know the truth. I often wonder if this is what being addicted to drugs feels like? Is it also a life full of lies and deceit? \nSo I've read Brain over Binge and I listen to many podcasts. I get that you are supposed to watch the urges pass by in your brain like tiny ducks on a river...but this doesnt work for me. On the outside I am a perfectionist,  but on the inside I'm a tornado of scattered thoughts and urges to binge.

I\u2019m so so scared. I don\u2019t wanna gain all that weight back. I don\u2019t know how to restrict in front of them without raising concern. The only thing I have is that I\u2019m vegetarian so I can\u2019t eat all the meals that they make. \n\nI always love going but this is the first time that I\u2019m actually fucking scared and worried I\u2019m going to have a shitty time.\n\nI\u2019ve been at my parents home for two days since I\u2019m flying out of their city and I already feel like a fat fuck because they don\u2019t eat any of my safe foods and they stock up on shit like trail mix, Ben and Jerry\u2019s, chips, and everything you would wanna get from fucking Costco.

I also seem to have lanugo on my ears. ugh.\n\nEvery now and then I get hit with huge waves of nausea and dizziness. Most of the time I've found it happens after restricting, avoiding sugary foods and then enjoying dessert with friends. I will then wake up in the middle of the night, gasping, dizzy, disoriented, vertigo, almost feeling sea sick. I was worried it was some sort of pre-diabetic issue (worry wart), but my glucose levels at my last blood test seemed normal.\n\nIt happened again today, the longest and worst its ever lasted and seemed a very gradual decline. Usually I am incredibly cold at work and wear a blanket, and have the most success restricting during work weeks. However, I had a very small lunch and breakfast but a lot of protein! Yay!\n\nThe heater was broken at work so I was sweating, and once it was fixed I went back to freezing. I got a headache and by 4 pm was very dizzy and lightheaded. By the time I got on the bus to go home, I felt carsick. By the time I got off the bus I was cold and shaking and had difficulty walking. By the time I got home I felt disoriented, incredibly nauseous, and my mouth felt numb. I felt like I was slurring my words. No fever but my temp was about 97.5. I find my normal temp to be 97.9. It doesn't seem low and I know hypothermia occurs at 95.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with this? I know hypothermia is a risk for many of us.

I've struggled with alcohol abuse, bingeing and purging, starving myself out for days at a time, and a few other addictive habits. \n\nFood is always my biggst struggle though. Whenever I feel empty, angry, sad, hurt, or anything else I'll immediately binge or binge and purge (I haven't done this in a year). I never looked at that as disordered eating though. I just thought I was really stressed out and that everyone binged when they were upset. \n\nThat's until yesterday. My husband and I were watching a really weird TV show and there was a scene where the main character was describing her eating habits to somebody. She explained how she would binge all the time and that she couldn't stop, she even went so far as to eat food out of the trash before. She didn't think there was anything wrong with it and thought it was normal. The person she was talking to though was horrified and told her it sounded like an eating disorder. My husband and I were awkwardly quiet during this whole scene which was made even more awkward by the fact that at the time I had a plate full of burritos, 2 pudding cups, a few bananas that weren't even ripe yet, and a plate of french fries in front of me. My husband looked like he wanted to say something but couldn't. We kept watching the show and she eventually went to an Overeaters Anonymous meeting, got a spouncer, and tried not to binge eat. \n\nThe whole night was weird. There were so many similarities between my eating habits and this fictional character's. It made me feel so ashamed of myself. \n\nI feel worse about my food issues than I ever have before but one good thing came out of it: seeing somebody else explain their binge eating disorder and how they were in denial about it being a problem made me realize I do have a problem. I want to see a therapist and try to get better. I'm so tired of this feeling of never having eaten enough even though I'm usually not even hungry at the time. \n\nSorry this was long.

I genuinely look like a completely different person it changes my whole appearance and I feel like most other people don't have to deal with this aspect when they gain weight?? This makes me feel like it's harder for me to not relapse. I'm all for curvy bodies and genuinely don't mind the weight gain on my body anymore, I even like the curves and boobs and ass I finally have, but it's my face that keeps triggering me to relapse and has stunted my recovery numerous times in the past. Going from a chiselled jawline to chipmunk cheeks and a double chin is just sooo noticeable. I can't take any photos of myself anymore. God forbid I take a selfie, that's now my worst nightmare.  I envy those who gain weight in recovery but maintain their face shapes. Even girls with rounder faces naturally, I think they look good, but weight on my face just doesn't sit right I look like a chipmunk.

It might be a little too late in the situation for me to get advice, but I don't see how it can hurt.\n\nFirst off, I'm thin. I eat when I'm hungry, and don't avoid it, other than the odd occasion when I feel too lazy or low to cook. Even then, I tend to fill up on snacks. I eat what I want, when I want. I've always been small, and my whole family is the same. My whole life I've been like this and I don't think I could change my body type if I wanted to.\n\nHowever, it seems to be a real problem for my friend. We're 2nd year uni students and have just moved into a house together. She monitors what everyone in the house eats, and often says things like \"why should I stick to a diet plan when no one in the house eats enough?\" But she simply doesn't see everything everyone eats. She's not always there when I get food from the kitchen, so the amount she thinks I eat is probably half that of the reality.\n\nShe has multiple therapists and a dietitian that her parents are paying for. Anorexia is also not her only mental health problem, but this is where it's become a problem for me. A few weeks ago she absolutely lost it at me, and said some things that, for my own person reasons, really hit me hard and have been a struggle for me to wrap my head around. The main thing she said was \"I've had to go around and tell all my therapists I can't get better with my best friend (ie me) around. Do you know how hard that is for me?\" She then went on to talk about how unhealthy she thinks I am, and finished with \"if you care about me at all you'll go and see a doctor and get a full blood count done\".\n\nI don't think this was acceptable at all, regardless of how it made me feel. Even if she hadn't managed to hit some of my most tender nerves during her rant (some other things she said really got to me as well but they aren't quite relevent to the post) no one should have to hear that from their friend. I know EDs aren't something I'm massively sensitive to, as I'm lucky with my biology and as such have never really thought about my size / weight or what I'm eating. What she said has got me thinking more about what I eat and when and honestly I don't really appreciate it. I've survived this long just listening to my body, I really don't think I'm in danger and I don't need someone with maladaptive thought processes on the subject telling me how I should be thinking.\n\nHopefully this is where you guys can come in. Is there something massive I'm missing here? All I've ever tried to do is help her, but to hear she's been telling anyone who matters that just my presence is detrimental to her recovery makes me not want to be around her at all. Is there anything positive I can do, a different perspective I can take, or should I just move house and take my \"ideal body type\" (as she told a mutual friend I have) out of the picture? I don't think either of us feel particularly comfortable anymore.\n\nTldr: I'm living with a girl with anorexia and she seems to believe my existence blocks her recovery.

Later, (age 10) I was restricting, but as I moved to a different country (age 13-15) my restrictive habits have gotten much more extreme and I have reached my a very low BMI. I was constantly either restricting and over exercising or binging/purging and, again, overexercising. It came to the point where I would throw up almost everyday and exercised 2-3 times a day for about an hour per session. The school tried to make me get diagnosed and treated, but I didn\u2019t want to recover from it, because although I looked tired and sick (especially from severe anemia), my cognitive function was not affected. After a few meetings with therapist my mother refused to bring me there, as it was too much effort and too expensive.\n\nI never admitted to having any issues and denied it til the end, so I never got the diagnosis. In year 12-13 I have to go to gym sessions every week. Last year I went only a few times and it triggered my compulsive exercise lasting about a week each time. So, I would exercise at night for 2 hours and had trouble eating. I stopped attending the session and got a low grade because of it, but I felt justified, as I was in recovery.\n\nI am still in recovery, but I thought it would be much easier on me this year and that I could participate. I found that the things that most triggers me is being observed when eating or exercising. I have an alternative to eating: not going to lunch and bringing my own food, which is much healthier and tastier. However, after numerous timetable changes I learned that I will not be able to have PE sessions with my friends and will have to do them with strangers instead. I already missed about 6 sessions since the beginning of school, I decided to go to the therapist for the first time to fix this and many other mental issues of mine, but the school is pressuring me into doing these sessions, mainly because last year I didn\u2019t attend them, even though I have lots of time to do it. I have to go there next Tuesday and this week we have a sports day. I have to do it next week, but I don\u2019t know how to not get triggered again. Thinking about it alone makes me want to starve and exercise to the point of getting to LW again, just out of anger at school, but also because my self-esteem is at its lowest ever right now.\n\nIn conclusion, how do I get into healthier relationships with sports and don\u2019t get as triggered by exercise?", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

Now that I'm older, I'm still with them every day to help out with their daily task. The thing is, that my grandma is basically the root of all of my problem. Shes the reason why I suffer from an eating disorder and anxiety: \n\nThe are only two thing on her mind. Number one, what I'm supposed to do next; e.g clean, organize, cook. Number two, what and when I'm gonna eat. \nShe is obsessed with food and for as long I can remember, she has given me inhumane portions of food multiple times a day. I have always been repulsed by eating and I've always had I hard time swallowing food, but if I had been more \"normal\" I would be morbidly obese by now. I always only eat like a tenth of what she places in front of me. I constantly tell her that I don't want food but she just ignores it and suggests more. And if I've just finished dinner or something she will ask if I for instance want some pasta after I've already finished. A little while ago she saw me eat some humus and asked me if liked it. Now theres humus everywhere. It's neverending. Every day she cries and screams at me because I don't want her god damn food. When I'm about to leave the apartment and I'm putting on my jacket she runs over and gives me something to eat on the way.\n\nShe also has an obsession with making me late for whatever I have to do. When I'm already half way out the door she makes me go back and help with one more thing. I always have to \"leave\" like 15 minutes before so she can call me back in, or else I'm gonna be late. When I finally get to leave for whatever after school activity, work or party, she wants to know what and when I'm gonna eat.\n\nSometimes she beats me because I don't talk enough with her. I wish I could but she refuses to wear her hearing aid so it's almost impossible to have a conversation with her. \n\nI've only recently noticed, that whenever I'm sick she spoils me. She just gives me money and suddenly shes nice to me. I know getting money isn't a bad thing but it just feels so wrong. As soon as I start coughing I'm suddenly her little beautiful girl that she loves more than anything. As soon as I'm fine again we're back to the scolding and beating.\n\nI'm scared of food and seeing those portion multiple times a day makes me sweat. I'm also underweight, I'm terrified of gaining weight, I feel disgusting and I cover myself in baggy clothes. I don't want to be bombarded by food anymore. It's like it's the only thing that matters and the only thing the world revolves around. I can't stand being told that I'm worthless. I know all of this seems like a very first world problem but I just can't stand it anymore. I wish I didn't have to see her", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I said I'm trying, but it's hard. He nodded, and didn't pry any further. I don't know how he noticed, because I was wearing an oversized hoodie and a pair of my boyfriend's tracksuit pants.

I was drinking a lot, something I stopped since that day. And at some point, my friend and I went to the buffet to get some food. Now, I remember filling the plate to the max, but not really what was in it. I remember walking with the plate to the bathroom, setting it down, doing my thing and all, picking it back up and going to the table. I remember picking up a fork, and then I just rember looking at an empty plate. And that was that. \n\nThe second, is right now. I've binged on McDonald's since becoming perscatarian, I just have more than one Fillet O Fish or if I'm in a country with vegetarian options then I have those. But I don't know what happened today, I just had two chicken sandwiches, one of which was a Big Mac, along with the fish and fries.

She\u2019s actually really sweet and caring, as I think a lot of people with eating disorders are. She just has a really bad habit of trying to get you to comment or feed into her anorexic behaviors. This story is one of these incidents. \n\nOkay. So there\u2019s a girl in my math class. She is obviously underweight, and has said many a time how she loves being small and how she never eats and basically starves herself. She talks about how many medical issues she has on the regular, and about all her hospital visits. \nSo, the other day she brings in some food. I\u2019m really surprised at this (of course I didn\u2019t say anything, because I didn\u2019t want to be rude) and she offers some to me and a guy that sits with us. I accept a few pieces, and he takes some too. As we continue to eat and do our work, she practically starts shoving the bag of food at people, trying to get people to take/eat it. This makes me uncomfortable because I am still having struggles of my own with food, and always get anxious when eating too much in front of people. By the time the class is almost over, most of the food is gone except a few little pieces. Then the girl says something that makes my stomach drop. \n\n\u201cYeah, my bf gave me this food and told me I had to eat it all. But since you guys ate most of it, now I can just show him the bag and tell him I ate it. Thanks!\u201d \n\nWhat the fuck. After she says this I\u2019m freaking out because I basically just helped her starve herself by eating some of the food. Not to mention while I was eating she was basically staring at me the whole time, so I can only assume that she was getting pleasure out of feeding others while she herself starved. Which makes me feel like shit because I\u2019m no where near as small as her, so she was probably judging me in her head. Why did I think it was okay to accept food from someone with an ED?

I was dealing with bad anxiety and extreme feelings of loneliness that was affecting my schoolwork and was able to talk about that with a counsellor. I\u2019m doing a lot better now, and with that my unfortunate tendencies of being a private person who\u2019s always \u201cdoing great, how about you?!\u201d are coming back and I\u2019m not sure how to be open and vulnerable and explain to a doctor how hard things have been and how powerless I feel (and how much I cry at night lol)\n\nI\u2019m sorry this is so long but once again I would really love any advice or tips you have for asking a Dr for help with BED. I really need this to be a useful/productive appointment for me and I\u2019m worried I\u2019m going to fumble it and end up back at square one.

We consider it many times, say no many times before giving in.\n\n It's not as simple as choosing not to eat a piece of bread because it has calories. It's that we know that we're going to feel guilty about it for hours after. It's that we are afraid of our reaction if we go over our arbitrary calorie limit.

I was in an outpatient program where a therapist would visit me at home every Monday. She asked me to write down everything I ate, for every meal of the day, every week, and then we would go through it together. \n\nI wasn\u2019t on any meal plan, and I had to figure out by myself what to eat. Now, one of my safe foods during my early recovery was yoghurt. It was a part of almost every meal, sometimes with oatmeal, fruit, next to a sandwich, etc. This was also during my extreme hunger period, so I would eat fairly big amounts of food. \n\nWhen going through my food diary, she pointed out that I was \u201ceating too much\u201d and that \u201cyoghurt has a lot of sugar in it and that\u2019s not healthy\u201d. Now, I see how that\u2019s something you would point out to someone who doesn\u2019t have problems with food. But it devastated me, hearing I was eating too much. \n\nThe result was me only eating two plain slices of bread for each meal the following week, which she then obviously pointed out as too little. The whole thing was just incredibly confusing and frustrating. \n\nThen, the last home visit, she wanted to weigh me. And she wanted me to see the number. As it was my highest weight yet, I freaked out and cried uncontrollably. I still don\u2019t understand while she would weigh me and let me know the number, and how that would help me in any way. \n\nIt\u2019s been 6 years, and it still sticks with me. \n\nHas anyone else been triggered by their therapist?", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

Lol. It\u2019s not really worth the time tbh. Anyway, i don\u2019t know if anyone is familiar with me or my post history, and I apologize if I make too many of these text posts. I guess I\u2019m just looking for some validation. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing at all with myself lmao. It is hard for me to explain how much this \u201cdisorder\u201d has taken from me and/or how much I\u2019ve lost because of it. \n\nI don\u2019t know where to start. In previous posts, I have mentioned parts of how this all sort of developed. I never intended for any of this to happen; I don\u2019t think any of us do. It\u2019s weird because I know that this happened due to certain decisions that I\u2019ve made. Though that is the case, I legitimately believe that if people did not continually, over and over, go out of their way to express their opinions about my appearance/body/eating habits/etc. I would not be in this position. Yes, I said it. If people could just keep their trap closed (pardon my French) and keep their own thoughts to themselves, I would not have an eating disorder. I truly believe that. \n\nThis post was probably sparked by what happened earlier today. My sister came into town; she wanted to grab a bite, so we went out to eat and I got her lunch. Anyway, at one point, she looked like she was about to say something but then she froze. I noticed this and asked her what it was. Here\u2019s how the convo went, sort of:\n\nMe: \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\nHer: \u201cOh. No nevermind. It\u2019s nothing\u201d\n\nM: *puzzled look*\n\nH: \u201cWell, it was just something one of my friends had mentioned, when I saw you last and she met you.\u201d\n\nM: \u201cWhat was it?\u201d \n\nH: \u201cShe said, \u201cYou\u2019re brother\u2019s acting normal.\u201d She kind of was surprised I guess, based on what I had told her and my other friends before.\u201d\u201d\n\nAfter my sister said this, I was a bit taken aback. I guess she was referring to the period where I had lost a bunch of weight. I talked about this time in my life briefly in other posts. To make a long story short, I went through a period where I was becoming overly conscious of the world, life, death, mortality, etc. As a byproduct of these changes in my life, I lost quite a bit of weight. But to be honest, it was something I almost never paid attention to. I never looked at myself in the mirror, and I didn\u2019t weigh myself or anything like that. I couldn\u2019t even say what bulimia or anorexia or an eating disorder was. I probably knew that I lost weight but it was by no means something I paid attention to. My personality just altered and my priorities change drastically. The way I was beginning to live my life would have suited me well, I believe. Little did I know how outlandish people would react to something that I almost never ever thought about.\n\nBack to my sister and the previously mentioned conversation:\n\nM: \u201cWell, what did she mean by that? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nH: *laughs softly* \u201c[my name], you don\u2019t know what she mean...Well, like...okay,...You went through a weird phase. You used to never talk. You used to never laugh. You just...weren\u2019t...I don\u2019t know...normal? Like, [my name], there was a point where I could hug you and literally my arms could wrap around you completely. I don\u2019t know. It was just..weird...I guess\u201d\n\nM: \u201cAhh, I see. So you told the...\u201d\n\n\nH: \u201cMy friends saw pictures of you from when we were younger and they were like, \u201cDang, your brother used to be hot.\u201d Yeah. USED to be.\u201d\n\nM: \u201chmm. I see\u201d\n\nThe conversation went on but that was the gist of that part of it. I\u2019m not really gonna go into detail about other parts about what lead me to developing my now-present eating issues. It just frustrates me to no end that the people who rode my ass about food, my body, etc. are completely unphased and unaffected by that which basically has derailed me. I\u2019m not the same person and I will never get to be. I honestly miss the person I was before all this. At the time, I didn\u2019t realize it, but I honestly think I was a decent person. I was pretty genuine, and I think I tried my best to do the right thing. That\u2019s all I can remember wanting to do ever since I was younger. I miss having the thoughts I used to have. \n\nNow I\u2019m just a complete mess. Everything is pretty bleak, and I don\u2019t expect it to get much better. To be honest, I am just prepared for life to get worse and worse and worse until it ends in the worst thing imaginable\u2014death. \n\nI feel like one of the only things that I have going for me at the moment is I am talking to a girl, more or less. I don\u2019t know where it\u2019ll go. \n\nLater after I met up with my sister, I ended up having a massive binge of probably 4-6000 calories. Not complete sure. Post-binge weight was 176. I was 170 before.\n\nHonestly, hearing my sister say that makes me want to just swear off eating. I\u2019be said this too many times to count, but I think I mean it this time I want to just fast myself down to 150 pounds. Maybe later on when I get there and lose this disgusting fat, I\u2019ll focus on building/gaining the muscle that atrophied two years ago. \n\nI\u2019m disgusted with myself, and I pretty much hate myself, but it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve promised myself that if I follow through with this fast and get over this hump, I\u2019ll forgive myself and try my best to move on. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m gonna try this fasting thing for real this time. \n\nIf you read this, thank you. I just want to be able to relate to someone about this stuff. And you lovely ladies and dudes are literally the only people that can relate. \n\nThanks again. Take care.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I was young, and being vegan I was already exposed to the world of diet culture and restriction. I was only in year 10 and I was counting my calories and restricted myself from food I enjoyed. I remember this one time during school, myself and a couple girls went to a cafe across the road for lunch. Me being vegan, I could only have chips. Now, I didn't want to eat chips because they didn't fit into my calories, they were 'higher carb' and 'deep fried' and oh so unhealthy, but I ate them anyways and it triggered me.   \n\n\nI figured, well fuck, I already ate over my calories, why not eat like a dick? I went home immediately after lunch, didn't even go back to class, and I ate anything I could get my hands on. I remember starting off by eating shit like veggies? (Coz vegan) then somehow eating a giant ass tin of belgian chocolate covered short bread biscuits (not vegan fyi). I felt so sick.  \n\n\nIt went down hill from there. I would binge at least once a month, and over eat atl east, almost everyday.  \n\n\nNow being 19, I sit here in bed writing this, with a full stomach and the same old fucking habit.

If successful it could become the second drug indicated for B.E.D to get approved, providing an alternative to Vyvanse. \n\nUnlike Vyvanse which is lisdexamfetamine, Dastraline was developed to be an **SNDRI drug**.\n\nHopefully all goes well with this investigation. There\u2019s not too many approved pharmaceuticals out there that are SNDRIs. I\u2019ll provide a mini overview.\n\n\n***\n\n***Key***\n\n**CA** = Currently Available\n\n**LA** = Limited Availability  \n\n**NCA** = Not Currently Available\n\n***\n\n**Previously Approved SNDRIs:**\n\n\u2022 **Mazindol** \u2014 **NCA** *Anorectic, treatment for obesity. According to Wikipedia it is not currently available as a commercially marketed and FDA regulated prescription agent for the treatment of obesity*\n\n\u2022 **Nefazodone** \u2014 **LA** *AtypicalAntidepressant &amp; antihistamine. Wasn\u2019t made well and brand versions were pulled from the market because it caused severe liver damage that killed a few people or something like that. It seems a generic IS available, I don\u2019t think anyone uses it*\n\n\u2022**Sibutramine** \u2014 **NCA** *Anorectic, treatment for obesity. Developed in the eighties, later withdrawn &amp; now discontinued. I doubt it would of been spectacular for people with EDs anyway since it\u2019s contradictions include: Depression, Bulmia, Anorexia, and Concomitant antidepressant use. Apparently \u201cSNDRI\u201d is a mislabel anyway because invivo it\u2019s a SNRI*\n\n\u2022**Phencyclidine** \u2014 **NCA** *This is PCP, Aka Angeldust. Definitely off the market. Considered a \u201ccoincidental SNDRI\u201d since it wasn\u2019t intentionally engineered to be one*\n\n\u2022**Ketamine** \u2014 **LA** *Yeah, its ketamine. Ketamine and Esketamine are not exactly simple to get prescribed even if you also have depression. I\u2019m no doctor but I don\u2019t have my hopes up about it helping BED. Coincidental SNDRI and it\u2019s SNDRI action is considered \u201cweak\u201d.*\n\n\u2022**Venlafaxine** \u2014 **CA** *Effexor. It\u2019s another SNRI that sometimes gets incorrectly called a SNDRI.*\n\n\u2022**Mepiprazole** \u2014 **CA** *Psigodal. SNDRI Anxiolytic medicine. Wow look! It\u2019s a real SNDRI, it\u2019s not considered \u201cweak\u201d, there\u2019s a name brand, it\u2019s actually available, and if you take it you won\u2019t need to get a liver transplant!!!! lol                                 BTW it has some additional antidepressant properties*\n\n\u2022**Tripelennamine** \u2014 **CA** *Pyribenzamine. Anthistamine with weak, coincidental, SNDRI action*\n\n***\n\n**Other investigational SNDRIs:**\n\n\u2022**Amitifadine** \u2014 **NCA** *Not on the market (yet?). SNDRI Undergoing clinical trials for alcoholism and smoking withdrawal.*\n\n\u2022**Tesofensine** \u2014 **NCA** *Not on the market (yet?). SNDRI Undergoing clinical trials for obesity.*\n\n\u2022**Centanafadine** \u2014 **NCA** *Not on the market (yet?). SNDRI Undergoing clinical trials for ADHD.*\n\n\u2022**Ansofaxine hydrochloride** \u2014 **NCA** *Not on the market (yet?). SNDRI &amp; prodrug of Desvenlafaxine undergoing clinical trials as an investigational antidepressant in Japan right now.*\n\n*** \n\nSo to point out the obvious the SNDRI options are quite scant", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I had the worst day yesterday and I need to tell someone. \n\nI've been in therapy for a few months (have not disclosed my ED or behaviors), and we've been working on my self isolation. I picked out a few meetup groups and she pushed me kinda hard to pick one and go to it. I picked a writing group that meets at a coffee shop in the evenings. I justified because I could tell my husband that I ate dinner there. But eVerYthIng WeNt wrOnG. \n\nFirst of all I was late because of traffic. By 5 minutes. Pissed me off so bad; I'm the sort where 15 mins early is on time, on time is late, and late is unacceptable. Also I wanted to get there ahead of time so none of them would see me struggling to order something. \n\nSo I walk in and gather all of my courage to say hi to them. The first one to look up says \"we don't take attendance\" and I die inside. The other person took out her earbuds and smiled, introduced herself, and then went back to it. After I take 5 minutes to order a black iced cold brew, I'm convinced that they hate me for talking to them/interrupting their flow/whatever, so I end up on the other side of the room from them, because there is a charger there and I can pretend that I have to charge my laptop to work.  \n\nThere are these teenagers talking next to me and even with earbuds in, I can hear them and I can't focus on what I wanted to write. I convince myself that it's a shit idea, there's no reason for me to even try anymore. I feel embarrassed and stupid, and I'm just sitting there not working on anything, too far gone to even allow myself to ask the barista for the wifi password. I opened up a new document and for an hour and a half I just pour it out. I berate myself up down and sideways. I typed out the worst vitriol, the meanest meanspo, the nastiest thoughts that live in my head.  I had to keep blinking and tilting my eyes up so I wouldn't cry in front of everyone. \n\nThen the woman that introduced themself earlier came up to me. She said she was done for the night, and thanked me for coming and said she hoped I'd come again. The shock of her being nice to me, unsolicited,  was the only thing that stopped me from bawling right there. Soon after, the other group members left and I was free to go. I drove home, told my husband it was all good and I was tired, ate a sugar free jello snack pack with a dollop of whipped cream, went to bed early and cried myself to sleep, my own meanspo ringing in my ears. \n\n3 and a half years now, I've been so alone. I've managed to convince myself that everyone I spend time with hates me, or it's only a matter of time until they do hate me.  I only talk to my husband, my mom, and my therapist. My husband is my lifeline but it's not fair to him that he is my only outlet, so I keep everything inside as much as I can, only doling out small dribbles of self recrimination to my therapist. I know it's poisoning me. But all I can do is not eat.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

A large part of avoiding relapse for me involves managing my urges to change my body and intrusive negative thoughts around food. I\u2019ve noticed that the seeds of disordered behavior are planted this way, so I try to view food positively and with gratitude. Sometimes I\u2019m more successful than other times.\n\nOne of my go-to positive thinking strategies is to give food a narrative - telling myself it was made with love to taste great and sustain my life breaks up my tendency towards viewing it fearfully, as an enemy. Weirdly, with Halloween time upon us, I\u2019ve noticed that I have an easier time viewing food made for children with kindness. For some reason, it\u2019s harder to harshly criticize the choice to eat when looking at a goldfish cracker or fun shaped pasta or a peanut butter bat. It reminds me that food is not purely fuel and that it\u2019s ok to choose something just because it gives you joy. With kids, we go to lengths to make food fun by giving it interesting designs and shapes, and does it seem unfair that as adults we must have this austere attitude toward what we eat? At its root, I think it reminds me to talk to myself gently, and to forgive the occasional indulgence because, like a child, I deserve to enjoy life beyond meeting my most basic physical needs.\n\nOf course, I get that this is often mass produced, low nutrient stuff, and obviously a diet of only stuff marketed to children would be problematic lol. The point I\u2019m making is that when you identify something that interrupts your ED\u2019s programming, that forces you to feel something positive toward your body or eating habits or food, embrace it! Recovery is a challenge, and if a tool helps you keep a good mindset, it\u2019s ok if it\u2019s a little bit silly or even childish. We all deserve that once in a while.

The weight-loss spiraled out if control obviously and especially in 9th grade. I had to go into treatment for a month and even though that's probably not a huge amount of time at all compared to others it was hell and it fucked me up even more. Since then I've relapsed twice (currently trying to Semi-recovery now) but I know and understand more about nutrition and health. My earliest memory of being afraid to eat was when I was very young though. We had a Wii Fit and the balance board would take your weight (might not be accurate but whatever I was probably in second grade and had no concept of what diets were or what the numbers actually ment) but it told me I was x less than I was last time. I got so excited for some reason. When it was lunch time i remember feeling nervous to eat some Kraft Macaroni and kept asking my mom if it would make the weight go back up. \n\nAlso after those years (age 9-14 probably) I'd always get little comments from my mom about how out of shape I was. I remember so many little things that over time could have all come together to create this monster. So many little habits, thoughts, and actions. \n\nFunny how when you look back and analyze things it's almost like foreshadowing. I also remember making a promise to myself around that age too that \"I would be normal\" hahaha it all went downhill from there. \n\nSometimes I actually thought to myself \"I wish I had an eating disorder... But I love food too much.\" Like it was some kind of fucking on and off button that would just make it easier to not eat as much.

It's not scary for them like when somebody offers them a rice crispy treat they can just deal. They can say no thank you in a way that doesn't make the other person feel bad. Where I start freaking out and get upset and give them an angry no! It's a social issue for them and sure it's nice to feel like I'm doing good things, it's not about that and if you want me to encourage people to be vegan based on my own experience it's just going to be me losing it.

And many say they always had a weird relationship with food. But for me none of these things are true.\n\nI was never fat or even chubby and actually was pretty skinny, on the lower end of a healthy BMI. As a kid I was sometimes told that I needed to put on weight.\n\nI was already an adult and had stopped growing. Plus I am a male, and puberty for males involves much less stress I guess. Even now I am okay with my puberty, and my tiny arms make me feel quite bad because I seem them as a reminder that it's not what an adult male body is supposed to be.\n\nI had the most intuitive relationship with food ever. I loved eating, but it just wasn't that big of a deal. I would eat whatever and then forget about it and maintained my weight.\n\nI have a functional family which loves me and I love them. Don't even know what an emotional trauma is.\n\nI have always struggled with feelings of being inadequate/stupid/uninteresting, but there is absolutely nothing that could have triggered me in that specific moment. And to be honest, everyone has this kind of feelings deep down. It's normal.\n\nI also had some body image stuff going on, but as a male it was more linked to wanting to be more muscular/tall/athletic. Especially my height was problematic. I was unhappy with my face, but if there was anything I was content with it was my weight and my belly and my body proportions. \n\nI also did not exercise (at least not regularly) and couldn't care less about it.\n\nI was just living my adult life as always when I started having digestive issues and ended up with meteorism and a bloated stomach. As far as I could remember, I had never had digestive issues in my life. I started wondering what was going on (and also if that was fat), so I went to a doctor and tried to cut out certain foods to see if I could improve the situation. \n\nA couple months later the ED was already in full force. As I was thin to begin with, people started to notice pretty early on. Also, weirdly enough, while now I am OBSESSED about my weight and the calories I eat, it took many months for me to start weighing myself in those first stages. I vividly remember that three months after the beginning of the ED I randomly weighed myself for whatever reason and when I saw the number I thought \"wtf? Why am I at this weight? Why did I lose weight? What is going on?\". Even though I was aware of my habits, seeing their effects was still a surprise. Then I forgot about it for a while. I also remember that it was only six or seven months after the beginning of the ED that I actually discovered what calories were and started acting accordingly.\n\nBasically I believe in the theories Tabitha Farrar brings forward - that EDs are largely genetic in nature, and while environmental factor can and do **definitely** act as triggers the basic cause is genetic/biological.\n\nJust a thought. Is anyone around here in my same situation? Sometimes I feel a little bit of an outcast because I just can't really relate to many of your posts.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I was/am severely bulimic for 5 years or so, and anorexic before that, and I only stopped purging /fasting/restricting since I became pregnant (for my baby's sake). I realised recently that even though I stopped purging/restricting/fasting, my mentality is still exactly the same and I am plagued by disordered thoughts, it's driving me crazy, and I feel like as soon as I'm not pregnant anymore I'll go straight back to the bulimia. So recently I started reading many books about Intuitive Eating and I really want to try to recover, for mine and my baby's sake.\nThe only problem is, I live in Japan and although I have a healthy bmi, the nurses here have put me on a strict guideline that I'm not allowed to gain more than 10kg throughout my whole pregancy (I've already gained 3kg) and have told me that I need to restrict salt, sugar, and processed food. I've also seen in various places that I should not eat \"junk\"/processed food, sugary food etc while pregnant, for the sake of my baby. (I haven't told them about my eating disorder history) and if I don't be incredibly careful of what I eat, I may develop pre eclampsia / gestational diabetes etc... \nI've heard that in recovery, I should eat whatever I want, I shouldn't restrict anything, I should try not to feel guilty when eating, and this is important in recovering from my eating disorder. \nBut I don't feel like I can when I have these rules from the nurses hanging over my head, also I can't help but feel incredibly guilty if I ever eat anything processed, because I've heard that it could harm my baby, which I'm terrified of doing.\nSo I'm at the point where I feel like I almost have no choice but to keep restricting the types of food I eat and maybe this isn't the right time to recover? I feel really stuck.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? Or has anyone been in a similar situation?", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

I don\u2019t know exactly what I\u2019m looking for either, mostly just to know I\u2019m not making it up in my head?\n\nI\u2019ve always been overweight, since I was an early teen. Food was my comfort blanket, my escape in a way. I always over ate, and I gained a lot of weight very quickly between ages 14-18 I\u2019d say. (I\u2019m not sure if age goes against the numbers rule, please remove if they do!) My relationship with food has been unhealthy for as long as I can remember. I dieted a lot, anything from slimming groups, shakes, meal replacements, fat blocker or carb blocker tablets, the alphabet diet, etc. I tried anything. But I always fell back into what I now would identify as binging habits. Eating so much I felt unwell, hiding the evidence, feeling incredibly guilty, gaining more weight.\n\nThis pattern carried on until about 6 months ago. I don\u2019t know how it started and I don\u2019t remember anything triggering it. But I stopped eating breakfast first. Then I started challenging myself to sit with the feeling of hungry. This spiralled, and now I either don\u2019t eat for days, or I eat so much I throw up (not intentionally). This past week has been the worst. I\u2019m not sitting here thinking, I don\u2019t wanna eat, I\u2019m not going to eat. I just don\u2019t. I feel hungry and I drink water and distract myself and tell myself I\u2019ll cook later, I just can\u2019t be bothered. But I never think \u201cno I\u2019m not going to eat.\u201d Then, if I do eat, it\u2019ll be half a meal. Just chicken nuggets and nothing else. A child\u2019s portion. A packet of crisps. A few squares of chocolate. And in my head I\u2019m thinking, I\u2019m just cutting my portions down, I need to do that. Or I\u2019ll cook a huge meal and eat until I throw up and then cry about it.\n\nThe thing that made how unhealthy this is click, was going for a check up at the doctors and I got weighed. (Haven\u2019t weighed myself in 4ish months). I\u2019ve lost the most amount of weight, I\u2019ve ever lost in any of the time I\u2019ve tried to diet. And I was so happy I cried on the way home. That\u2019s when it clicked, I think. Because then I didn\u2019t want to change, I decided to keep doing whatever I was doing mostly subconsciously, consciously. I opened up about it to my friend who has a diagnosed ED and she told me to speak to my doctor but I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m still overweight, by a lot for my height and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be taken seriously. How can I have an eating disorder, but still be grossly overweight? But I\u2019m also scared for where this will end up, I already struggle with several mental health issues and I don\u2019t want to end up in a dark place.\n\nWill my doctor believe me?

I\u2019m no longer an XXS or XS! And that\u2019s okay.\n\nI eat normally and healthily. I don\u2019t overeat and I eat when I want to the amount that I want.

If there were cookies in the tea room at work, I'd be completely consumed by the thought of them until i consumed them. and having one was not a possibility for me, once I started there was no stopping.   \nFast forward to today, I still binge like a maniac but its all different now. I am not wildly consumed by sweets in the room, heck, I dont even feel like eating them anymore. I can easily say no to a cookie if offered. Its not a compulsion anymore. But I stilll binge, on shit i don't even want to eat, late at night when I'm feeling low, because I crave the feeling it used to give me. I discovered through binging that serotonin hit that food could give me. And now the binging has become a product of my depression, instead of what it was initially; a product of my eating disorder. I crave the feeling of being SO extremely deprived of something, and then giving in and consuming mountains of it and getting a high. Now, All my binges still exist, but out of pure emotional desperation to feel something, anything good. It doesn't ever work though. But i still do it. Now, they are just triggered by sad emotions rather than just the longing to consume sugar and foods i used to restrict. I don't restrict anymore, I shouldn't be binging but I do, because I feel so low all the time. I'm sorry for such a long post but I find it hard to articulate into words what I'm going through and am hoping there are others oput there who've been through the same.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

Throughout 9th grade I had various jobs, all of which except one I was let go from, I worked for a chimney sweep firm doing whatever work they had in a warehouse for minimum wage, until I walked because I physically could not handle it anymore, I just wasn\u2019t built for it, so I stayed unemployed until a friend of my dads hired me to be an extra hand at a fucking cementing business, I paved driveways, weighing all of 110lbs.\n\nI often got ragged on for my weight, because, spoiler alert, I\u2019m a guy. And apparently we aren\u2019t supposed to be self conscious and resort to extremes methods to lose weight. I was dropped off at home one day and was never called back for another job. I worked for Subway for about a month but was again fired for some reason I don\u2019t even remember.\n\nIn 10th grade, I started EMT school because I had been volunteering at a fire station for about two years (actually how I got my first job at the chimney sweep firm), I passed with decent grades and started my new job. It grew on me quick, and I started to take back my life because I wanted to use my new job to help people like me at their worst, I actually started to live a normal life until it grew too much on me. Soon it meant everything to me, everything in my life was about my job, how my coworkers felt about me meant more to me than how my parents and brother felt. My self esteem has always relied on how others perceive me, at one point it lead me to an identity crisis where I had to ask myself if I was even myself anymore, the way I acted and looked and talked was so different, and it\u2019s not just a \u2018getting older thing\u2019.\n\nI had no idea who I was, and for a bit I kinda stepped away to take one last look at myself, and came back the same husk, I don\u2019t act like me, I act like how I think people want me to be. I started losing control and soon became suicidal, like, writing a note and everything. I still know all the details, the where, how, what I\u2019m going to say before, who I\u2019ll say what to. This is ongoing, I still feel like this, I\u2019m losing control over my life and I want to give up, I want to restrict my diet again and purge. I have no direction anymore, I\u2019m physically drained just being around people, I feel like I\u2019m not living, just mimicking emotions, and if I change I\u2019ll lose everything.\n\nLet me be frank, I have no friends. I am close with people at work, but I never had any middle school friends, I go to an online school to avoid a repeat of middle school and thus know none of my classmates, and never do anything outside of work besides stay at home and do nothing of value, because as a person I hold no value.\n\nSorry, I\u2019m just offloading all my inner-problems to whoever happens to come across this, if anybody I know is reading this because they saw the post on my account. I\u2019d just like to ask that you keep this under wraps, if you want to talk, cool. But right now, it\u2019s late, basically midnight, and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do tomorrow.

(adding that because i use BMI numbers)\n\nHi, never posted here before but I really need to know if this is just me or if anyone else has this problem and knows what to do about it. A little history- I'm a mid-20s female, restrictive anorexia/exercise compulsion since age 12. Currently at one of my lowest BMI's (15.6). Getting help with an outpatient therapist, but have worked with dietician, therapists, doctors, etc over the last decade. I always just gain enough weight to get everyone off my back by eating a very strict diet and exercising with a very rigid routine. I stay at this higher weight (usually bmi 17-18) for a few months before stress, disgust, self hate, etc gets to me and my weight slowly creeps down again and I'm back to where I started and it's the whole family meltdown, threats of more treatment, taking me out of grad school and so on. I have kind of two reasons for this post. \n\nFirst, my therapist last week met with both me and my mother and instructed my parents to stay out of my newest attempt at recovery, that this is something I have to chose. I understand that this is something that I need to want to do, but I just can't do this on my own. I was supposed to limit my exercise this week and change nothing else, which my mind translated into \"make sure you don't gain weight this week because you aren't supposed to be eating more\", which of course has not gone well. I've eaten less than ever, did not succeed in cutting down the exercise, and my weight hasn't changed. In the past my recovery attempts were always started by my parents freaking out and taking over my food for a little bit. I simply don't have the will power to suddenly make myself eat the kind of foods they forced me to in the first few days of \"recovery\". Fast food, milkshakes, real dinners with more than a piece of dry chicken and vegetables.. I know the guilt and misery and doubt and fear that comes from eating outside of my very rigid routine and I simply can't choose to subject myself to that willingly, and yet that is what is expected of me. During this latest relapse, I have been almost waiting for my parents to come visit (I live out of state) so they would see how bad it has gotten and save me, but now the therapist is telling them not to do that and I feel so lost and alone. I can't make this stop on my own, but I also can't admit that because then I have to feel guilty for not being \"strong\" enough to keep up this disorder. I feel trapped and have no help. I wanted someone to come and take all this out of my hands and lift the burden of having to make decisions off my shoulders and enforce food so I don't have to feel guilty about eating because I have someone watching me, making sure I do. It sounds so so pathetic writing it out like this, but I'm honestly just so lost. I try to step back and look at the big picture and I can see how stupid this all is, but when I try to actually make a change, I dread the feelings that come after so much that I just can't do it. \n\nThe second reason for posting is a problem I am having right now. I overslept today. That is like a cardinal sin in my mind. I slept an hour and a half past my alarm. I don't have work or really anything important today, but the feeling that I have been lazy and gluttonous, and those were calories that I didn't burn because I was laying in bed and not moving, is so overwhelming that I want to cut my daily calories in half to try to make up for it. It doesn't matter how much I exercise or how little I eat, I can't get past the churning feeling in my gut that I don't deserve food because I wasn't burning as many calories as I would have been if I had been awake. Exercise compulsion has always been one of my problems. I can't sit at all during the day (which makes school and work very awkward). People notice and comment on how I am always standing and it is humiliating, but if I want to eat I have to \"earn\" my calories by never sitting down, never sleeping past my alarm, never not moving/standing. It is miserable and the amount of time that exercise (usually walking) takes up in my day has become increasingly more and more to the point that it is beginning to become unsustainable. I just want to feel like I can eat today without the guilt of knowing I overslept an hour and half. \n\nWow, this turned into a total mind dump. I'm so sorry and thanks for reading.

I somehow convinced myself that I was cold-hearted, with an analytical \"thinking\" brain rather than a creative \"feeling\" one. For me, being \"soft\" emotionally was tied inextricably with being \"soft\" physically. With being weak. I've always feared not being ENOUGH, and weakness and softness were equivalent to not-enoughness in my mind.\n\nSince August, however, I've been seeing a therapist again, and we have had quite a few discussions about allowing yourself to ease into and feel emotions (both positive and negative). During my relapse 2 years ago, I was also in an abusive relationship, and I had used my ED to numb out all of that pain, guilt, and anger. We spent a whole hour confronting those feelings, and have also gone back a little further to when I was younger to tease out the isolation and fears of unworthiness that I believe were contributors to developing my ED in the first place.\n\nThose sessions, combined with the resting I have been essentially forcing myself into (attempting to go against movement compulsions, and also just really bloody tired after years of excessive exercise) and actually listening to my hunger - has resulted in sometimes FEELING THINGS. Like, in my heart! It's been really scary, because there are a LOT of uncomfortable emotions in that little guy, especially after isolating myself for so long, BUT there is also a lot of warmth in there, and hope, and a desire to be creative again. Before my relapse, in the few between years where I was doing really well, I had so many creative passions that I lost when I got sick again. And with these increased feelings, comes an increased desire to return to those creative passions.\n\nAnd it feels weird to say this, but I feel like I actually want to feel softness again. I want to feel open to the world around me. I don't want to let my fears of being physically soft stop me from loving again. \n\nHella uncomfortable. But I would rather try and feel that discomfort and allow it to bloom into something beautiful, rather than stuff it down and numb it out with restriction and movement.

But in my dream I told him what I have never told him before and that his \u201ctrying to help\u201d type of advice makes me feel worse and do worse. He hides binge foods from me (which is good, sometimes) and often makes me feel bad whenever I want to indulge or eat like a normal kid my age. He doesn\u2019t ever try and get me sweets because I used to binge on them but now I feel like the mere though of eating sweets around him will make him judge me and think I\u2019m bingeing and don\u2019t know how to control myself. Same with certain trigger foods like cereal\u2014 I\u2019ve cried so much because I feel horrible and guilty for eating them because my dad has forever labeled them binge foods and think I don\u2019t deserve to have them, that I\u2019m just a [lots of self degrading words I don\u2019t want to type out for triggering reasons]. Basically I told him that and how it has even stopped me from eating certain times because he was around and I didn\u2019t want him thinking I was bingeing, even if I was only eating an apple or something. He only got angrier and yelled some things back that made it seem like it was my fault, something that would probably happen irl. There was another memorable part of my dream where, I guess, I was a actress? And my friends were filming something and I was supposed to act in it but I couldn\u2019t. Some other girl acted in it and I had to watch her. I was told I couldn\u2019t because of my eating disorder, that it changed me in some way. I was told that my attitude and actions and personality all changed because of it and I could no longer do the things I wanted to do with the people I liked because of it. These were both just in a dream and I\u2019m not looking for advice or anything I\u2019m just posting this to voice my thoughts and whatever, thanks for reading, I hope you have a good day.", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

She's 21, around 5'9\" and her lowest weight has been around 79 pounds in the last year or so. She's moved from an abusive household with my mother to an abusive home with her now ex boyfriend and his mom to our grandparents' home where she is constantly fighting with my grandparents because of her eating disorder.\n\n She struggled mainly with anorexia around 6-7 years ago but her main problem right now lies with her bulimia. She is constantly stressed and her reaction to stress seems to be to binge and purge. She has no money and has to pay restitution every month for a car accident, a shitty job but no better options at the moment, and doesn't really have anyone supporting her. I do my absolute best to always have her back and stick up for her when no one else will, but it's hard to do when her eating disorder is what's causing a lot of the turmoil in the house. I hate saying that because it's not something she can control, but it also can't be blamed on anyone else. It just is.\n\n She tends to always overeat and my grandmother always belittles her for she. She and my grandfather will either mock or fuss at her, even if she wasn't planning on purging. But that just makes her more inclined to purge. At this point she's stopped really trying to make peace with them and now responds with sarcasm until they leave her alone, but that just makes everyone mad. Obviously her health is absolutely the most important thing, but my grandparents are both retired and live on a fixed income, so providing for two young adults, one of whom eats almost everything and then throws it up, is very difficult on them.\n\n And it's not like she hasn't tried to get better. She has a rare clean day where she doesn't do anything, and I give her nothing but praise and support (thought I try to show support even when she slips up). She's tried therapy but there aren't any therapists around that are equipped to deal with eating disorders. She's been hospitalized and in rehab facilities, but nothing has worked. If anything, they just made it worse. They fed her 4000+ calories a day when her body was used to the absolute bare minimum and did nothing for her mental health.\n\nThere is also the problem that she's scared to recover because that opens possibilities for people to say she was faking it. Honestly because this is such a difficult thing to understand, a lot of people we know say she's just doing it for attention even though it literally has almost killed her several times. She's scared to recover because then people will say it was never real or that she just drew it out longer so they'd pity her. As much as I wish she could just not be bothered by people like this (including our family and our grandparents that we live with), she's the kind of person to take those things to heart.\n\nI just don't know how to help her. The only person that can really get to her, in all honesty, is me, but I'm also the only one in her corner. I'm terrified of having a serious talk about this and how important recovery is and the impact it's having on everyone else (though it's not her fault) because I'm scared she'll think I'm turning against her. The last thing I want is to lose her trust. I love her more than anything and I just want her to be happy, but I don't know how to help her. She's told me time and time again that she wants to get better, but her condition is so severe that I don't even know where to begin. If it continues as it is, I'm scared I'll lose her entirely. I've tried to explain our situation as best I can but I'll answer any questions needed. Any help or suggestions are very much appreciated.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

{"post_id": "dl36ez", "created_utc": 1571675998, "title": "Recovery \"motivation\" in social media", "author": "lilgeoffrey", "self_text": "I see so many posts on social media aimed at motivating people in recovery from eating disorders, reminding them that starving themselves or losing weight or being skinny will not make them happy, not make them feel more beautiful or loveable or make their lives better. To be honest, I've probably posted something similar myself in the past.\n\nI mean, it's certainly true. Starving yourself or purging, losing weight or engaging in destructive behaviours is NOT going to make you feel happy or beautiful. That's simply a fact. There could be small false waves of a feeling of achievement, but you will never be satisfied and, most definitely will never be happy.\n\nI read one of these posts recently and I thought to myself \"you know, I've never found reading this kind of thing helpful\". In some ways actually, it even has the opposite effect. And I found myself thinking about why that's the case. What does that statement mean to me? What does my \"eating disorder\" mean to me?\n\nAnd then it seemed so blindingly obvious. I don't know about anyone else, but I never fell into this mess under the illusion or hope that it would make me happy. I have never thought to myself \"if I just lose X, I'll be so much happier and life will be better\". In fact, and I don't know if this is true for anyone else, my body and brain is actively opposed to anything that resembles happiness and the notion that losing weight will make me happier was never, and never will be, a motivating factor. I know I had some truly bizarre thought patterns in the beginning (\"if I get skinnier maybe I'll look taller\" is a personal favourite of mine) and I'm not saying that I was fully aware of this when it all started 12 years ago, but I know now that happiness to me is bad. It feels wrong, selfish and undeserved: I'm not allowed to be happy and when I do get those fleeting moments, I'm immediately thrown into a burning pit of guilt.\n\nSo what does my eating disorder mean to me? Why has it taken over my life for so long if not as a way to make me feel better? Why do I continue to go through that weight loss cycle when I'm not trying to get thinner or feel beautiful and delicate?\n\nI'm not going to lie and say I don't fear putting on weight and becoming fat / simply fat-TER, because I do. It does scare me. And today I realise why it scares me. The past couple of months I've been doing a lot of in depth thinking and questioning over why I am what I am, tracking my thought processes right from early childhood to now and the thing that stands out the most to me from anything else is fear. Crippling fear of things I have no power over and no way of saving, changing or protecting anyone from.\n\nWhen my eating disorder became apparent, I became hyper focused, hyper fixated on weight, food and my body. And my brain was so caught up in all of that it forgot about the real worries. The real, scary things I was truly terrified of became replaced by a \"safe\" fear. Being scared of eating too much or being fat is far easier to cope with - hey, I can control what I eat and how much I exercise to stop this from becoming reality! - than the repeated existential crisis I was enduring that I was powerless to. Especially when, deep rooted, I blame myself for the lack of power, like I should have god-like abilities to keep the world safe from harm, like its simply a result of my own laziness and selfishness that others suffer.\n\nBy becoming absorbed in food and eating, restriction, over exercise, calculations and balancing acts, routines and obsessions, I'm distracted away from my failings - failings that mean I'm not allowed to experience happiness. Because being happy and content means accepting and enjoying the fact that I have neglected my duties without a care. Staying stuck in this rigmorale traps me in a perpetual groundhog day where nothing changes and nothing can move on, because if everyone is okay now, then keeping everything the same will mean that they'll be okay forever, right?\n\nMy eating disorder is not about being happy. In fact, it's almost the opposite. Maybe I'm alone in this, maybe I'm not. But I think it's time to be honest and say that these \"reminder\" posts are superficial motivators that online \"recovery\" communities rely on that feed into stereotypes. We all have our demons, our triggers and our contributing factors, but being \"thin, happy and beautiful\", in my option anyway, is not a prominent one, if one at all.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Cool. Fine.

So she says she wanted these chips, cool with me, but I guess I didn't seem excited enough so she started asking me about other foods and I just awkwardly shrugged and said whatever is fine. So she gave me ice cream. Okay. I ate it.\n\nThen after 20 minutes, she said she was going to go grab her candy jar from upstairs instead of grabbing us a bowl of dinner. No problem. Okay. Problem. She brings it. I binge. Disgusting. I went into the restroom after realizing, and looked at myself in the mirror-- I saw I had chocolate smeared all over my lips. I'm such a fat fuck. I purged. In the bathroom right next to the living room. My friend could probably hear me.\n\nI felt so depressed afterwards that I started acting weird. Closed off. Easy conversation that we had been having all night became awkward. I felt so guilty. I feel so guilty.\n\nSince we decided I should sleep over before heading to college tomorrow, my friend let me borrow some clothing. The clothing accentuated my stomach pouch, and today at school I had a presentation that I fucked up due to being so stressed about people seeing my stomach from the side. I kept holding my stomach, trying to suck it in, etc-- probably drawing more attention to it anyway. So embarrassing.\n\nNow we're at lunch and my friend graciously packed me a meal this morning, and she was teasing me about making sure I eat it. So all my other classmates playfully joined her. So now I'm eating this food when I feel I don't deserve any of it because I'm a fat, worthless fuck.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I'm dizzy, hungry, tired and finding it hard to concentrate. I can't go to the gym today and going for a walk seems to risky right now, it feels so weird to not be able to do more. I know I can still restrict, but without the exercise it just, idk, feels like it won't work, which is weird for me because I used to never exercise and would lose just by restricting. Now though, it feels like if I don't do something physical I'll binge and balloon up, like I don't trust myself to not binge if I don't work out. \n\nIt's like I think working out will stop me from eating, and without it the only thing left to do is EAT. I don't want to go on another binge streak, what would you guys recommend I do?", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

All but for a few specific instances, every time (not an exaggeration) I visit my parent\u2019s place, I turn into a binge monster.

I follow the same eating style when I am at my own place. I also keep no junk/binge food at my place - at all. I have barely any food in my place so mum jokes she has nothing to eat when she visits and wants a quick snack or bite. So, I feel I\u2019m triggered somehow when I am at there place. Could it be that they have all this food I don\u2019t have at mine? Could it be the emotion/comfort eating of being at home? Could it be that I am struggling with my independence - keep returning to the nest? Everyone in my family knows how I eat - I don\u2019t hide it. Mum and dad probably think I\u2019m just hungry and starving myself on a perpetual weight loss diet so I\u2019m getting my fill at their place.

I came to this community because I THINK I might have BED, not sure, but the descriptions others have written about seem to fit what I feel. It all started with a friend who was constantly sick, missing school, throwing up in the bathrooms, super skinny, never ate during lunch, and always talked about being fat. I was so concerned at first, I didn\u2019t even know how she could just not eat when eating was such an enjoyable activity. I don\u2019t know when it happened exactly, but I started to hate myself and I wanted to be skinny like her. She\u2019s anorexic/bulimic, and I still constantly compare myself to her. I never actually lost any significant amount of weight, only 5 lbs in a week. I don\u2019t have enough willpower to resist food haha so I never actually starved myself. Recently, I quit a sport after three years of playing it, so my mindset became, \u201cI don\u2019t have as much exercise as I did before, so I should eat way less to compensate for the extra calories.\u201dIt turned into thinking about food everyday and messing up my planned amount of food/calories, then binging, then trying to purge, then only sometimes being able to purge some of it, then crying because I\u2019m gaining weight and because everyone around me is so much skinnier than me. This girl would usually talk to me about how fat she was and how everyone at her sports activities were much skinnier than her, and how she would never eat dinner. Once she even showed me her \u201cthinspiration\u201d, I have no idea why and it was out of the blue, but she told me, \u201cI wish I could be like her.\u201d I told her to delete the picture, but she said no and that it was a \u201creminder\u201d of how she used to be anorexic and that she shouldn\u2019t continue her bad eating habits... I definitely didn\u2019t believe her. After that, I cried because I wanted to lose weight so badly, but I ended up binging again. Now binging is a daily thing, and all I can think about is food in the morning, during my classes, after school, and when I go to bed. I come straight home and just eat my whole house. I\u2019ve never felt such excruciating guilt in my life before. Everyday is worse than the last. And I just want it to stop and be normal again, but everytime I sit at lunch with this friend, my mindset of restriction comes back and the cycle starts over again and I just hate myself.

I thought that this was normal, that everyone felt so awfully about themselves that they would skip meals and just exercise instead.  At first, it was light dieting and exercise, but then, when I was about 12, I started skipping school lunch and got into competitive dancing and gymnastics .  Practices \nwere longer and more frequent, which meant less time being around food.  This made me feel great about myself, I was visibly skinnier and hiding the fact that I didn\u2019t eat well.  Then my friends started to catch on, and pointed out that I wasn\u2019t eating, I would lie and say I wasn\u2019t hungry(I thought they\u2019d tell my parents, and really didn\u2019t want to disappoint them) I still lie to this day about my eating habits.  Once high school started, I had quit gymnastics as a whole and studio \ndance.  I got onto the high school dance team and started competing with them.  I\u2019m still not eating lunch and occasionally skipping supper.  My friends make fun of the fact that I have a lunchbox with nothing in it.  Sometimes they jokingly bring up that I had an eating disorder, I don\u2019t hold any of this against them, because, after all, I lie to them and say it\u2019s because of my \u201cweird eating schedule\u201d.  \n\nBut now I\u2019m a sophomore in high school, I\u2019m mostly relying on caffeine to get me through the day and maybe intake 100-250 calories\n a day.

But I just kind of realized that this is an issue and maybe I need to sort it out?\n\nEdit:  I have now been seeing a therapist for a few months, she has been helping me work through my problems.  I have not been diagnosed yet, but my therapist has brought up certain eating disorders she thinks I may have.  She is most certain I have Anorexia athletica, which is when one obsesses over losing the calories they have just eaten.  I\u2019m just glad that I\u2019ve gotten help for it, even though it was a little tough telling my parents what was happening, but I\u2019m glad I did.

I've been lurking this community for a while. Never considered my story special or interesting in any way but I'm starting to feel deeply misunderstood IRL.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast November I decided to finish my weight loss journey that had been brought to a halt when I first started dating my bf (3.5 years ago!). My goal was: lose those 25 pounds that could turn me from OK Looking to Objectively Hot. \n\nNot even sure what Objectively Hot means. The only definition I come up with is sexist. I really do want my bf's friends or the guys from work to objectify me in their minds. I try not to blame myself for that, as I have been bullied for my weight since I can remember and that can badly screw with your POV. I just wanted to attract **good** attention, curious looks from men I found attractive, but always ended up getting mocked. I can't look at any photos from highschool or college years without cringing - I was fat and mentally abused by two different boyfriends who never hesitated to pull that card to trigger me.  \n\nIn my early 20s I've started losing weight for health reasons and people were quick to notice. I decided to seize the opportunity, get a personal trainer and change my life for real. My self loathing became dangerous and I was finally serious about a fit lifestyle. I did lose around 23 pounds, but then met my boyfriend and gained a little weight. Not anything serious, but because I was \"just OK\" at that point (not having completed the master plan of becoming hot) it was a catastrophe. I started feeling the danger again last November and acted quickly. \n\nI was doing great for a while. Coming back to the gym and carb-less diet felt exhilarating, I felt invincible and there were even moments I could actually say \"Wow. I look good\". I do take breaks from gym and diet for vacations but this time I decided to just \"take a break\" for no reason. I told myself I'd bounce back. No time for gym right now but it's only temporarily. I kept piling on more excuses and \"issues\" that could be easily resolved. That's how one week turned to two, two turned into three, to a month and so on... You get it. \n\nThis is where I am right now, my pants feel extra tight, I binge on whatever because \"I'm on a break and it might actually help me lose weight in the beginning\". It satisfies my anxiety between one bite to another, but now I feel so sad and pathetic. How do I let two months affect me this badly? I have a life to live and the last two months are meaningless if I get it together now. I don't know if I'll be able to, though. I feel like I've lost the groove and will never find it back. But I can't give up, because this gym-diet balance is the only thing that keeps the demons away. I now look at myself in the mirror and pinch every bit of fat until it's red and throbbing. I make sure my bf doesn't see that part because his reaction is bad enough when I just sigh :(", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I know I should probably talk to a doctor about this and not ask strangers on the internet, but here's the main thing: *I* dont think I have an eating disorder. But I'm starting to question it.\nSome background info: I've been small all my life. I'm studying my last year at uni, and i've been very stressed out, to a point where skipping lunches is a regular thing for me. So, this is where it begins to get weird. I dont feel hunger, until maybe late evening, and as a result I dont eat much (maybe 1-1,5 meals a day depending).\n\nI'm medium/short height (im a female, not sure if that matters to the equation) and I'm underweight. My partner keeps telling me that I'm becoming skin and bones basically, but I really dont see it. \n\nAbout a week ago I fainted, and ever since I keep getting headaches even though I drink a lot of water and sleep enough.\n\nI've written it off as me just being stressed, and thats why my body is reacting this way, but could it be a possibility that I have an eating disorder?\n\nI know it probably sounds strange with me asking since I said I eat very little, but I really dont understand it as I dont feel the hunger or see myself as skinny. I do notice i've lost some weight, but I dont think im that skinny.\n\nThank you for your time, I barely know anything about eating disorders and I'm just generally confused...\n\nI've also started regularly getting low fevers in the evenings.

I was basically raised by my dad when I was a baby and by my aunt when I was a toddler because my mom was a teacher and was gone quite a lot.\n\nMy dad didn\u2019t talk to me or interact with me. He fed me and put me down for naps, but I remember clearly one day he had put me in my crib because he was upset that I had colored on the wall and punched the hall wall in front of me by accident; he\u2019s never really looked before hitting something. And when I was about thirteen I saw him destroy our garage for something my brother did. I hid in my room the rest of the day and didn\u2019t eat. But that\u2019s not what started it. Only where it started to get worse.\n\nWhen I was six, two years after my mom and dad divorced, I had a brother at my dads and a sister at my moms. I felt replaced and confused. I knew my step mom and dad since four, they got married to each other when I was around that age. But I didn\u2019t understand why I didn\u2019t get as much time with my parents as they did. I didn\u2019t understand why my siblings in the house I lived with had a dad around 24/7 and I didn\u2019t.\n\nThings were way different in the house I visited rather than the house I lived in. My step mom treated me like a doll and I didn\u2019t know what I was feeling but I know that I felt weird and not happy. I was never girly and she took that away from me. She took who I was away. She forced me to eat everything on my plate, and they were wrong portions to give a child. And even after I threw up packaged lunch meat, she made me eat packaged lunch meat later on. I gagged on condiments but they kept ending up on the sandwiches I would tear apart because I hated sandwiches. I got hit, yelled at, and grounded just for not eating and \u201cmaking excuses\u201d.\n\nWhen kids complain something hurts, they can\u2019t swallow, they are itchy, or there tongue is tingly - it usually means they are allergic to something. I got rashes and hives when I ate certain fruits when I was young but my stepmom kept giving them to me and would take caution with her child.\n\nMy dad tried doing something but she wouldn\u2019t let him. Eventually he had enough and I remember them fighting one night, putting us to bed, and then sometime in the middle of the night after Christmas day - my dad took me away from there with him.\n\nWhen we were a little older, my dad met someone else but I knew he was seeing multiple girls before finding this one. I broke a necklace that a girl gave my dad to give to me. I didn\u2019t want anyone else. I just wanted me and my dad. I didn\u2019t eat much during this time. He was always better to me than my brother but I still was blinded some because of him.\n\nMy second stepmom was better about food but still made us eat everything on our plates. Eventually we got older and she stopped doing that as much but would still ask us to eat something that wasn\u2019t on our plates.\n\nWhen I was a nanny I fell into anorexia and tried being Vegan. At one point all I ate was apples and developed orthorexia. Once I lost my period I started incorporating foods back into my diet. I went through binge eating and then bulimia. Soon I was on a Keto diet and started to feel amazing. Eventually I went back home and my diet changed again. I went back to eating apples and avoided everything. I had panic attacks trying foods again, but, yet again, eventually I asked for help and now I have been listening to my body and eating the right things for me. I eat the correct portions, and eat what doesn\u2019t make me sick.\n\nIt can take a while to find a way of eating that works for you, especially with experience of eating disorders and being forced to eat certain amounts of things put certain things and when you don\u2019t have the means to do so or doctors - the people that are supposed to help - don\u2019t give you correct information. Some of the things I have, I\u2019ve heard that not many doctors or clinics can really help on. I mean, I\u2019m doing everything a doctor would do to me anyway. I mostly go for eyes, ears, checkups, and emergencies.\n\nAnyway. Through my journey I\u2019ve realized I can only eat fish, chicken, veggies, fruits and anything not associated with gluten, nuts, sugar, red meat, corn, oil, and dairy. My digestive system is healthy and happier, I\u2019m healthy and happy and I enjoy food again.\n\nI have a history of diabetes so I\u2019m most likely pre type 1 diabetes. I have low blood sugar - which was also a sign for my anemia (which I did get tested for a long time ago as well as the gluten/celiacs thing by a certified nutritionist and chakra healer). I have history of depression, anxiety, ADHD/ADD (known since little), diabetes, thyroid, Lupus, losing your memory/brain fog, AIP, sciatica, and such.\n\nI found out I have Candida, SIBO, IBS, GERD/acid reflux, and I also have a few food allergies; pineapple, strawberries (better when frozen and organic), kiwi, arugula, cilantro, bananas, and corn.\n\nI follow a few different lifestyle \u201crules\u201d along side being pescatarian which works better for me than vegan ever did though I try to still eat vegan/raw vegan every now and then. I eat out maybe once a month now and on occasion, like birthdays. It\u2019s still a little hard to reach full recovery with still living at home but I\u2019m making do for seven more months.\n\nI\u2019m not fully recovered by my history of eating disorders as I still struggle time to time but I just wanted to share my story and say that it is hard to live with, but with the right resources and fixes - you will be okay and someday be able to enjoy food again. I believe in all of you.\n\nThanks for listening. \ud83d\ude42", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

So I just ate way too much food and guess what, I feel sadder now.\n\nI would appreciate feedback because I have no one to talk with about this.  There are six 'kids' in my family.  My mother and father are both dead. About five years ago my stepmother died and she split the remaining $$ of my fathers inheritance amongst my 3 sisters and 2 brothers and left me out.  Ok, she and I didn't get along so that doesn't surprise me.  What I can't seem to let go of is how my siblings didn't make a decision to split it six ways.  We all generally get along and I believe we all love each other in various amounts depending on each person.\n\nI try to let it go, it hurts a lot.  How could they do that?  How is it ok with them that they got money and I didn't?  We are talking at least $50,000 each.  Whenever I bring it up no one ever wants to talk with me about it.  It's always 'you are still on that?\".  Which triggers a lifetime of feeling separate, of feeling like I am not allowed to share my feelings. (I'm the only fat one)  I know that old stuff is in there and I also want to hear at least one or two of them share what the process was.  Did they consider it?  etc.? How can they be ok with that??\n\nI should mention that I have gained 100+ pounds in the past 10 years.  I haven't seen my brothers &amp; sisters in 3-4 years until last month when there was a medical emergency with one of my siblings and I moved in to help.  So this morning he started talking about the stepm- and it brought it all back.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I told him I'd rather work his shifts for him than have to deal with this bullshit. And he agreed that it's not right and apologized and then offered to give me a raise.

It sucks both ways.\n\nWhen I started binge eating like 6 years ago I gained a TON of weight very quickly and basically went into hiding. I only went around people if I absolutely had no alternative, but considering that the bingeing went unresolved for so many years.... pretty much everyone who knew me, extended family, etc all saw me like that.\n\nWhich I hated because it felt like I had no privacy with my inner struggle - no one gains THAT much weight unless there's something going on, so I felt like pretty much everyone knew I was having a meltdown and was a psychological/emotional dumpster fire. And that it was obvious to anyone who saw me that I was struggling with, and currently losing, a battle of self-discipline as far as food went. Not to mention that anyone who disliked me definitely got that thrill of vindication, you know, that smug \"she got fat\" that I myself love feeling when it happens to others (I am not a good person I know)\n\nJust by looking at me people could know that I was struggling, not doing well, and was not able to control myself. My bingeing was super shameful to me, and it was very difficult knowing that anyone who even slightly knew me would only have to make a few logical connections to know my \\~shame\\~\n\nBut now it's the inverse where everyone notices that I've lost/am losing weight.\n\nI hate when my parents notice when they see me every month, because I know they're thinking \"thank god, we thought we were going to have to be embarrassed of our fat daughter forever\"\n\nI hate that my extended family will notice, when I go back to the east coast to visit my grandma. They all made so many comments when I gained weight and treated me differently (except my grandma, who I love and honestly legitimately said to me that she noticed no difference and I look exactly the same, after I first blew up and everyone was talking about it)\n\nI hate when any picture of myself gets posted online, no matter how unlikely it is that anyone will see it, and I've been wanting to but absolutely can't bring myself to have a normal social media presence because I don't want new pics of me online\n\nLosing weight and getting all those \"nice\" comments is super uncomfortable. I know people are being nice and most of them mean well. But it's the same feeling of overexposure - that it's public knowledge that I agonize, obsess, devote a TON of energy to thinking about my weight.\n\nI feel like having a really nice body is only admirable if it's natural and effortless - that you don't have to struggle, fight yourself, and work hard to maintain it. A nice body that is the result of deliberate effort means that I care about how I look/am perceived, am vain, am insecure, etc. I want to have this image of being someone who's smart, thoughtful, successful... and also happens to be super hot.\n\nIf I could have it my way, I'd go back and erase everyone's memory of me over the last 6 years, so they wouldn't know that I got fat and then had to lose weight. Then I could pretend to be effortlessly hot and no one would know that I'm actually an insecure mess who obsesses over food.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Actually, in all honesty, longer than that but 15 was when my x small jeans were too big and I actually found out what an ED was. Back in 2002 when I was 15 the internet wasn't a thing but I feel like I have grown up with the ED community as it developed online, I have watched and been part of it as it has found its supportive roots and man, I feel like an old timer. Y'all still the same though. It's really good. \n\nThe last 5 years I was doing really well. Like, REALLY WELL. For the past 10 years the ED voice has been a different voice and not my voice, if that makes sense?\n\nYou know how comedians get laughs out of self-depricaton? Well from about the age of 24/25ish I started to just say out loud all the stupid stuff that my ED told me. People laughed, they couldn't relate but they told me their stupid weird mental shit back and it helped. ED's are ridiculous and sometimes they deserve ridicule.\nSomeone on this sub recently said \"I don't know, I just work here\" as an attitude to ED's and that's EXACTLY how I felt about it back then. I bitched about my ED in the same way I would bitch about my boss. Damn, that helped. I recommend it. 100%. ED's are the same as a boss or a teacher; you need them to get paid/grades but they are a fucking controlling arsehole that you wish you could be rid of. \n\nSo. Now. After however long being able to talk over the ED voice, suddenly it IS me again and I find myself smacked back down in to the depths of ana/ED thoughts and actions and it feels familiar and comfortable and warm and welcoming ...and fucking terrifying. But warm and comfortable and fuck it feels good to not eat and have control and hide and hibernate and hip bones and I am skinnier than her but I am not but being cold is great but big jumpers are great and aaaahhhhhhh. \n\nI don't really know where this is going actually. I know I want to make sure everyone here knows that you can still be a functioning human person and your ED is just a tumor that can be slowly cauterized. Maybe this is me giving myself a pep-talk? IDK.\n\nI guess I mostly want to say hello and I am here and I am a voice that is not your ED voice and I am probably going to be around for a while because I have been sucked back in but I also know what it is like to not be just my ED so if you see me posting about anything then talk to me and I will talk to you. \n\nDamn.\n\n\n\nTL:DR: Hello!", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I was an athlete in high school and have always been fairly active but slowly gained weight throughout college and especially grad school. I always hated my body but never engaged in any ED behaviors until the past 2-3 years.   \n\n\nThrough years of therapy and self-exploration/experimentation, I finally overcame many of my mental health struggles. I stopped drinking (was never addicted but it negatively impacted my mood/sleep/eating), am in a healthy relationship with someone I love and want to be with LT, started prioritizing myself, got therapy, mindfulness, poetry, writing, etc. Over the past few years, I've really gotten into powerlifting. I absolutely love it. It's been a complete game-changer for me in that it shifted my focus from aesthetics to performance. I've always been naturally \"curvy\" and gain muscle (and fat) fairly easily. I've beaten a state record and and hope to compete nationally eventually. It feels so fucking awesome to be able to deadlift almost 3x your own bodyweight! Powerlifting also drastically helped curb previous bad habits (i.e., restriction, excessive cardio) and serves as a way to regulate my mood--I always feel better after a workout.   \n\n\nI started bingeing a few years ago and was at the highest weight of my life. I tried many diets but always failed. So I decided to eat whatever I wanted but start IF. Initially, I did 16:8, then 18:6, then 20:4, and then OMAD (one meal a day). I've been eating this way for about 2 years now. Initially, I loved it. I lost weight, didn't have to worry about breakfast or lunch, could eat to satiety (I'm super short so my cal intake needs to be fairly low for me to be in a deficit), increased mood and productivity, etc. Sidebar: I try to be flexible and will still go out to breakfast with my partner, relax on vacation, eat at social gatherings outside of my \"window\", etc.  \n\n\nHowever, I feel like I've now programmed my body to expect a \"prescribed\" binge every night. A normal meal doesn't satisfy me at all. I also feel like the thing I felt like saved me from my depression--lifting weights--may just an another form ED-driven exercise compulsion that is masquerading as self-care. I honestly don't think I would be alive today if I didn't start lifting; it has radically improved my life. I am competing in a few weeks and decided not to cut a weight class (my eventual goal) until I get this ED under control. I lost 15 lbs last year but have slowly been regaining weight and am completing a pretty stressful postdoc at an ivy league school. And, of course, treating some patients with EDs (though this isn't my main clinical focus). I think one contributor is the stress of my new job, coupled with the fact that I moved by myself to a new city and don't really have any friends/much time for a social life.  \n\n\nI guess I just wanted to vent, as I obviously can't tell anyone that I work with about this. I'm also curious to hear people's thoughts on lifting and/or IF. I really feel like both of these things have dramatically improved my life on the whole but I also know that maybe they're also just part of my ED (even though lifting preceded it). I'm genuinely not sure and don't want to give up the thing I love. My ideal body type is definitely not stick thin--I want to be muscular, lean, and strong. But maybe I just chose this sport because I'm reinforced for bingeing (I always lift more weight the day after) and because being a competitive lifter allows me to consume more cals than if I was sedentary. I don't think this impacts my quality of care but I do sometimes feel like an inauthentic therapist. I decided to bite the bullet and am seeing another psychologist next week who specializes in evidence-based tx for EDs about this but I feel ambivalent about potentially having to give up IF and/or powerlifting.  \n\n\nSending you all so much love.

This is my first time using Reddit (first account but I don't plan on using it in the future) and I spent 2 days building up the courage to actually make this post. I'm not sure if this was the place to make the post but I'm not very familiar with Reddit. I'm also pretty sure I've broken some rules because I don't understand them exactly, I've read the rules 5-6 times but I'm still not 100% clear about them.\n\nIt's basically all in the title, I'm 15F and I guess I'm at a healthy weight. I also don't want to offend anyone with ana I don't want to have an ED or ana but when I just recently searched up what a wannarexic is, I felt like I could identify with some of the things which lead me to feel really guilty. When I was 13, my friend called me fat and that's when it began. My last 2 years have just been me trying to lose weight but failing, I successfully fast/crash diet for a few days then I binge which caused me to gain more weight. I've gained 10 lbs from all my diet attempts (I started at around 94 and my highest weight was 105 - I'm 153 cm/5\"0). What makes me think I am wannarexic is my relationship with food. I've read what people have said about wannarexics is that they say they want to lose weight but then they proceed to eat junk anyways. That's the case for me sometimes. Sometimes I can eat everything without feeling anything, sometimes I feel so guilty that I have to purge right after, other times I feel nothing for a bit until a few hours later and realize its too late. Another thing people have said is that like people with wannarexia would say how little they ate and stuff while people with actual ana would maybe like hide it?? (don't exactly remember what they said) But when I'm with my close friends I'm always ranting about my hunger. \n\nI feel so ashamed and guilty almost like I'm mocking people who are actually sick but I don't know.

I track every little bit of food that I eat, weight everything precisely, watch my macros, log everything into phone apps, calculate the time between each meal, make sure I never snack, etc.\n\nAnd then, uncontrollable cravings and binging hit. I feel like my subconsciousness plans it ahead. I tell myself that I will only buy a bit of cookies or whatever, make sure I don't exceed my daily calorie limit. I go to the shop and come back with a bag full of junk food. I tell myself that I will only eat a certain reasonable amount, so it is alright. I am an adult, surely I can control what I put into my mouth? But, in the back of my mind a voice is already telling me - who are you trying to fool? You know its gonna be another b/p. I manage to ignore it. I want to prove to myself that I DO have control, or at least, if I do somehow end up binging, I can take responsibility and at least make sure that I don't purge (I want to break the cycle!). I fail every single time. I feel extremely guilty and go back to eating healthy again for 1-3 days, but the story repeats itself.I have reached a point in binging where I will stuff any food that I have at home, even if it does not taste good, so I can't keep anything available. And if I don't keep food at home, I have to go to the shop, and I risk losing control once I'm there... My binges are so bad that I end up hurting my gums by chewing too fast, just to make sure that I can purge as soon as possible. I can't believe this is me...I desperately need help, as I know by now that I am too weak or stupid to fix it myself, but there is nothing. I feel like my ED is getting worse every single day. I am very scared that at this rate I will start to b/p daily...\n\nHas anyone gone through something similar? I would be happy to hear any tips, ideas, opinions, anything.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

If I did this but went back in time to when I was a healthy weight, I would probably get labeled as OSFED.

That was stupid. \n2. That was stupid.\n3. I got what I asked for.\n\nBackstory: I\u2019ve been struggling with ED behavior since I was 10 years old and I\u2019m in my 20s now so it\u2019s been a long ass time. \nHowever, in the biggest plot twist of my life, it turns out my parents emotionally abused me my whole life.

(Again, yay.) \n\nAnd today I asked my dude for my diagnosis so I could feel validated in being there. He obliged. \n\nMy diagnosis? Bipolar 2. \n\n*Cue WTF look from me*\n\nOkay so just even swallowing that diagnosis has me reeling we can unpack that some other time. \n\nI don\u2019t have an issue with that diagnosis so much as I have an issue with him not saying a single thing about my ED. Not. One. Thing. He just acknowledges it as fact but I\u2019m like NO I WANT MY ED DIAGNOSIS. \n\nObviously it\u2019s the second appointment so we have a lot to unearth still and my diagnosis may change but my sick ass Brain is like way to not even MENTION my eating disorder. And way to make me feel even less validated and even less \u201csick\u201d (if he\u2019s not mentioning it I must not really be sick right?

{"post_id": "dm5unt", "created_utc": 1571865110, "title": "Throwing food away freaks me out", "author": "FancyDoughnuts", "self_text": "I hate throwing away food. It makes me feel bad, guilty, angry and sad. If my fear was \u201cnormal\u201d it wouldn\u2019t really be a problem, but it is pretty extreme with me and causes me a lot of distress.\n\nI am the daughter of a family of German immigrants in South America. My grandparents had to go to war and suffered famine. My mom was thought to thoroughly clean her plate, and to NEVER throw away food. This was then passed on to me and my siblings.\n \nBecause of this, I would rather eat food that has gone bad instead of throwing it away. Soggy salad? No problem, I\u2019ll eat it. It tastes disgusting, but I will gulp it down. Ham or cheese smelling funny? I\u2019ll wash it in the sink and eat it. Bread got mold? I\u2019ll cut the moldy part off and eat the rest. Orange juice is fermenting? Just drink it anyways, there\u2019s no way you are throwing that away.\n\nThis is pretty awful. It\u2019s what I have seen my grandparents and my mom do so I do it too, but I really dislike it. It makes me eat a lot of calories and on top of it it tastes awful and I do not enjoy it.\n\nIn recent years (I\u2019m 30 now) I have noticed this and tried to change it. I am the only person in my home who throws away food and my mom and siblings do not agree with me when I do so. Many times I have tried to throw away food that had gone bad but my mom takes it away from me and eats it. We never get really sick. Worst case scenario is an upset tummy but that\u2019s it. We\u2019ve never gotten food poisoning or anything. I guess our stomachs are trained to eat bad food? \n\nMy obsession with not throwing away food causes many nuisances. For one, my partner and I frequently fight over it. He never eats leftovers that are more than 2 or 3 days old,  while I can eat leftovers from last week or older. I am also an expert in freezing stuff, and he makes fun of it and says that me and my family are crazy for freezing everything. He also throws away food, and that hurts me. \n\nHe, for example (and this one really freaks me out) doesn\u2019t like to eat the soft crumbs inside white bread. He cuts open the bread and pulls the soft crumbs out, then he leaves them on his plate. And then he throws them away. It drives me crazy when he does. So I tend to take them, smear butter on them and eat them. Of course I feel guilty afterwards. All those calories for nothing. But white bread is one of my fear foods, i never have it because it is high in calories and it\u2019s addictive so I binge on it. And there he goes THROWING AWAY that precious warm soft white bread! Of course I can\u2019t let that happen so I eat his leftovers. I feel awful when I do. I also do something else that really embarrassed me and that is I pick up the crumbs that are left on his plate after he is done, I lick my finger and pick up the crumbs and eat them.  Encause while he eats the delicious white bread I eat a salad and I wish I could have some of his bread, so I eat his leftovers like a starving dog. I hate it. I hate myself for acting so sickly.\n\nThe other day I was sitting in the train. A man sat in front of me and grabbed inside his bad, pulling out a banana.

I've begun to restrict my diet again. in the past it was always an issue. I'd starve myself for days, then eventually binge one day, and starve myself again. I started noticing when i was maybe 9, being like 'oh shit i might have an eating disorder'. i've had a rough childhood, lots of trauma. its caused a lot. but i never really realized and i never really cared. I just knew i hated the way i looked. i was never really big, looking back on it now. i just knew i was bigger than i wanted to be. i've always been a stick - it's just in my genetics. but as i got older, hitting puberty and all - i started to notice my hips, my thighs expanding, and of course the change of sizes in clothing. and for anybody, this would just be normal. of course people grow and bodies change. but it was really hard for me. especially with my past and how i was treated. I've never been comfortable or confident with my body. but about two years ago i started eating regularly and i felt fine about it because i began going to the gym. i felt a lot better about myself. but after a few months of that, a lot was going on and i couldn't go to the gym anymore. i was eating regularly still for about a month. and then i just started feeling so disgusted with myself. and i snapped, again. this went on (on and off) for the rest of that year. \n\nso, for the past year i've been doing fairly good. i was eating regularly for a while, with a little bit of ups and downs, but about two months ago i was sent to a facility due to my depression - and there i was forced to eat. it was hard at first but eventually i looked forward to meals. i've been home now for about a month and a half, at first i was eating regularly and barley even worrying about weight or calories. however, the past two weeks my mind has been fucking with me. i've been in an outpatient facility until i can go back to school. (which i'll be going back Tuesday) but i guess i'm just concerned. i said i was going to eat healthy and try to cut calories. and i was. i was counting and eating my exact amount i should be eating. but these past three days i haven't let myself eat anything over *** calories. i was hungry at first, but now i'm feeling kind of immune to the feeling - like i was in the past. i kind of like the feeling now. and it scares me. because i don't want to go back to my old ways but at the same time i could lose some weight. i just get so upset looking in the mirror and not seeing my hip bones stick out as much as they used to, and my thighs bigger than normal. at least it all feels that way. it feels like the mirror is too small for me, if that makes sense. i've gained four pounds during the hospital and i plan to lose 10. \n\nI don't know what kind of advice i'm hoping to receive. all i know is i'm fucking scared. I know i really want to lose weight and i'm already beginning to obsess over it. but i think i can stick to my low calorie diet. I'm just scared that i'll go back to nearly nothing because what i'm doing now is almost close to that already. and i know i'm the only person who can control what i do and what i eat, but i also know that part of me wants to go back to that. also it feels like it's kind of an alternative to self harming. i know this isn't healthy at all and i know i'm a wreck. but please if anybody has tips or advice, just let me know. i'm really struggling and i can't really talk to any loved ones about this without them freaking out and it damaging me more. thank you :)", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

So far I\u2019ve been successful, having shed about 25% of my size and I\u2019m down at the last few vanity pounds and trying to work on my fitness at the moment. \n\nI have been counting calories and intermittently fasting since the start, and that means I skip breakfast and only eat lunch and dinner. It has been a lot of discipline, but in the last three weeks I have transitioned to eating only one meal a day, which I estimate to be around xxxx kcal and I fast till the next afternoon after each meal. \n\nThe idea of eating dinner or anything out of my eating window has started to give me anxiety, and I don\u2019t let myself have any snacks, mainly because there isn\u2019t anything much I like to eat that\u2019s accessible as I am overseas for school right now. This three weeks coincide with me starting a gym membership for the first time in my life, and I have been going at least twice to four times a week, for a minimum of one class (usually two) plus yyy kcal of cardio each time. \n\nAm I exhibiting signs of an eating disorder? Today I broke my fast for the first time in a good few months, and I ate a fairly normal amount for the entire day, with about 1/4 of it in the night in the form of fruits, nuts and ice cream. I\u2019m not beating myself up about it, but I don\u2019t want to fall into a cycle of overeating and underrating, especially because lately I\u2019ve been feeling that I need to go to bed hungry, otherwise I\u2019ve eaten too much for the day and tomorrow I\u2019m going to have to eat less. I\u2019ve finally started to like the reflection in the mirror,  so I definitely don\u2019t want to jeopardise my progress, after spending so much effort losing weight. \n\nI know I\u2019m going to have to transition into maintenance sooner or later, but the idea of eating two meals a day now scare me, and I\u2019m already on the verge of throwing away the ice cream in the fridge because I don\u2019t particularly enjoy the taste of it, and I don\u2019t like wasting calories on things I don\u2019t enjoy. Everyone\u2019s been congratulating me on my weight loss and telling me to keep it up, and I don\u2019t know how to deal with these new feelings regarding food and my body. I still feel fat, and I pinch my stomach and thighs all the time and find myself disappointed at the fat that still surrounds them. \n\nWhat can I do to help myself? I would really appreciate some tips and advice that I can apply right away, and I also have a history of depression that might be affecting my mood at this moment in time. It\u2019s hard to pretend that I\u2019m fine with everything and to deal with these conflicting feelings, and I feel like I\u2019ve failed when I put something unhealthy into my mouth. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve lost control yet, and I am definitely not looking to be underweight or to starve myself. Thank you for taking the time to read this, I don\u2019t know where else to go.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

(Also possible trigger warning, lots of self hatred)\n\nOkay, so I basically have no friends. This is making wanting to stay in recovery extremely hard, and I almost just want to starve myself to literal death. I\u2019m in my senior year of highschool, and I was determined to make friends this year, because every other year I was in and out of hospitals and inpatient for a variety of issues. I started out with one best friend, and I had to cut ties with her because she was doing heavy drugs and shit like that. The second close friend I had drifted away from me and basically called me a terrible person (I kind of was, but I think she was just as much as me). And the third, and last friend stopped talking to me after I found out she was being abused and I called cps on her parents. This is the story of the third and most recent friend.\n\nSo this friend was there for me and never judged me for my mental health issues. We got really close over a short amount of time. Over the 9 or so months of knowing her, I started to notice that her mom was kind of off, in a way. One second she would be super nice and the next she would be almost yelling at us while I was over at her house. So our birthdays come around, and since they are only about 5 days apart, we have a sleep over at her house to celebrate. Half way through the night my friend says something to her mom, and her mom gets really pissed off. We go to her room and sit down, and her mom opens the door and tells me to get out and to sit in the living room. I step out but I stay outside the door. I heard her slapping my friend hard (with what I later found out was her dirty ass shoe). I try to go back in but I can\u2019t. So the next day I tell my mom what happened and we decide to call cps. Long story short my friend has stopped talking to me, and I feel like a fucking failure of a human being. Not to mention her mom blamed my friends weight gain on me, saying she never gained weight before she met me (which was actually because she got a job and had money to buy food outside of her house, had nothing to do with me and her mom just didn\u2019t like me cuz I\u2019m fat). I am just so hurt because I know I hurt my friend, even though I had good intentions. \n\nBeing this lonely has in turn, made me relapse. I have no one to hang out with to get my mind off things, I have no one to talk to about my issues, or anything for that matter.

I've been restricting for the past 3 weeks, although not very successfully - most days are higher than my 600-800 range limit and I've binged twice in that time. Still, other than the binges I've always been under my TDEE by a fair bit, and even the binges were &gt;3000 so theoretically they shouldn't have done *too* much damage. I've been trying some new exercise classes to try and find something my lazy ass will stick to and don't set off my anxiety too much (I *hate* exercising in front of people), so I've been going to the gym 2-3x a week. I've also been walking much more even though it's winter and the weather is shit.\n\nSo what's the problem? I'm consistently eating at a deficit and I'm exercising a reasonable amount. I should be losing, right?\n\nI DON'T FUCKING KNOW THOUGH. I've never entirely trusted my scale, but I'm pretty sure the battery is dying making the readings even more erratic. My bedroom floor is carpeted and warped too, and I don't have enough space to keep it in the same place all the time so my readings are all over the place. There have been differences of up to 5kg depending on where I put the scale which is bullshit. I can't take it to the bathroom because my housemates don't want a scale in the house, plus the floor is warped in there too so it's not like it would make a difference. I also rarely get the chance to weigh myself in the mornings so all my readings are never when I'm completely empty. Logically I should be losing weight but the number on the scale is actually going up. \n\nAnd even knowing that the scale is inaccurate, I can't see a difference at all and I've been body checking like a crazy person. Maybe my waist looks slightly smaller, but ED brain is telling me that that's just my hips getting bigger. I guess my jeans feel a little looser, but that's probably just because I'm a depressed mess and laundry is really low on my priorities right now so they've just stretched. Other than that there is no physical difference and while I know it's a short amount of time everything I know about CICO is telling me that there should be *something.* \n\nIs it dysmorphia? Is it water weight? Is there actually no difference and I'm doomed to be a hideous fat lump forever? I have a GW for Christmas and I don't think I'm going to make it, but I don't know how far off I am or what adjustments I need to make because I don't know where I'm starting from!\n\nThere is literally no point to this rant.

My stomach will be distended with food, but I'll still feel \"hungry\". This started when I was old enough to grab food on my own. My parents went to get neurological testing done to find out why, but instead they found out...\n\n\n- I'm autistic. Being autistic in the 90's, when there was a lot less understanding of what the condition means, meant a lot of people were peddling pseudoscientific quack treatments. My parents fell for one of them, which included restricting my access to dairy, among other things, with no rhyme or reason to it. There were times I would eat something and feel fine, just to be told next week that I was \"allergic\" to it and couldn't have it anymore. So I just started eating those foods in secret. It made me envy people who could eat whatever they wanted, and taught me I had to hide what I ate.\n\n\n- My mom has an eating disorder. There were times where there was no food in our house, not because we were poor, but because she just doesn't eat. So during those times, I didn't eat, either. I'd get school lunch, then would have to hope there was something to eat when I got back. I couldn't rely on food being there when I needed it. I learned to eat as much as I could when I got the chance.\n\n\n- I was a little chubby in middle school as I was going through puberty - maybe about 10 pounds overweight. My mom put me on a diet when I was 13. Now instead of buying lunch at school, I'd get a few slices of deli turkey (I'm not exaggerating. That was it.) My mom still judges my weight to this day. She'll be proud when I'm skinny, and insult me when I'm not. She makes comments whenever she sees me eating something unhealthy, regardless of what weight I am.\n\n\n- Also, I'm transgender (FtM). So puberty just made me hate my body even more. I got top surgery, so my chest is no longer a problem, but I naturally collect more weight in my hips, butt, and thighs. Even during the times I've been at a \"normal\" weight, I would still look at my body and see fat in \"feminine\" places. I keep hoping that maybe if I lose just a little more weight, and go to the gym for a bit longer, I'll look how I want to, even though I know that won't be the case.\n\nPut it all together, and you've got cycles of extreme binge eating coupled with cycles of extreme restriction. My lowest adult weight was 140, while my highest was 210, and it seems like I yo-yo about once a year. I'm at 165 right now, and feeling myself slipping back into a binge cycle. \n\nI still want to be able to look in the mirror and see a body I'm proud of. But at this point, I care more about fixing my relationship with food. I can't keep doing this. \n\nI just don't really know how to start. I've never been able to find a therapist who can deal with all of the issues I bring in general. I found exactly one person in my area who felt qualified to work with autistic transgender people, and then my insurance wouldn't cover her. And she didn't even have expertise in eating disorders. I don't have the energy to go \"shopping\" for therapists again when there's the risk that eating disorder specialists will see my other diagnoses and treat me like I'm less than a person.\n\nEven after all of this, I still hesistate to call what I have an \"eating disorder\". Disordered eating habits, sure. But I've always dealt with it on my own. I guess I never really wanted to think about how much it controls my life. I didn't need another piece of baggage to add to my pile. But it's there, it's always been there, and I can't ignore it anymore.\n\nThis post doesn't really have a point or a nice conclusion. I guess I've never put all these thoughts together in one place. I want to be the kind of person that can say \"even with all these things working against me, I came out alright.\" I can't truly remember a time that I've been okay with my body, or with myself.\n\nIf you got through all this, thanks for reading.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

That's not normally a problem but I just started doing ultimate Frisbee at school and it's kinda fucked up the way I budget myself. So yesterday I had practice and at that time I hate not eaten for around 30-40 hours and because I'm fucking retarted I also didn't drink any water for over a day. Now I'm running 'n shit and all if of a sudden my limbs start to go numb my vision gets all dark and splotchy. I know I'm probably going to pass out because this same thing has happened to me before and I just dropped in the middle of the hallway at school, but that's another story. So I tell my friend whose next to me \"hey ****** I'm probably going to pass out in a sec so I'm going to sit out for a bit\" he was confused and I jogged off to the sidelines. When the drill ends he comes over I'm super out of it but I cought it fast enough so as long as I don't run/walk/stand up I'm going to be fine. I make jokes he's not worried but I sit out for the rest of practice. When practice ends I realize I'm going to need a ride even though it's only a 15 minute walk home so I call people but apparently the team captain asked my friend why I was out and he told him (this becomes important later). I go home eat and drink cover myself with some stupid lie I don't even remember. \n\nThe next day I'm in first period and I get sent down to my guidance counselor (GC) and I'm thinking I'm bout to get yelled at because I have a D in English. Turns out my team captain snitched to my GC. Luckily for me the captain didn't give much detail about the matter, so I managed to wriggle out of it saying that it was just that morning not almost two days and, I made up that I was late so I skipped breakfast and I had to do a project during lunch. GC bought it and I got away Scot free. \n\nHowever I have practice tomorrow (today technically because it's 2:30 lmao) and I don't know what to do and I can't stop thinking about what if the captain tries to follow up or watches me closer or this spreads through the team or the school, if it gets to my GC again she will have tell contact parents and they are already super suspicious about me and eating so I'm freaking the fuck out. \n\nWhat do I do? Has anything like this happened to you? if so how did you handle it. \n\n\n\nTLDR: I starved myself almost passed out during Frisbee practice and had to talk to my GC and now I don't know what to do.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I am currently (20F) and have struggled with an ED since I was 13. I was initially diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa Restrictive Subtype but last year began abusing laxatives and diuretics so I am diagnosed as 'Purging Subtype.' I went through a six month period of severe B/P behaviors while at my lowest weight ever. Basically, I would fast all week, than plan a massive binge, than make myself purge all night. And repeated every. single. week. I was so miserable and so food obsessed. I would cook ridiculous meals like a buffet and eat until I would nearly vomit, I was torturing myself. In July, I began making some recovery efforts. Returned to my therapist, had to get stomach surgery from the damage my purging had done, and began attempting to eat more regularly. First just a solid, non restricted meal once a day, than twice, and now three times per day. My mother has been incredibly triggering and grows more angry with me at any efforts I take to further my independence. My grades and gpa have greatly improved, and as a foodie at heart, i am not only able to cook meals but portion them and eat. I have become much better at not asking for reassurance and instead assuring myself that i need to eat. My parents work a lot so I log my food via photography which i send to my best friend or therapist for support, and i even make efforts to bring snacks such as some muffins i bake, or a smoothie to school. I have deleted my calorie counters but i am not really able to eat at restaurants yet, as i dont feel mentally ready. \n\nMy mother seems to miss my former B/P behaviors. I went through a really intense period of binging 10000+ cals per day, to the point where in july i needed hospitalization and as i mentioned earlier, a surgery due to severe bowel impaction. Sometimes, she implies that she misses these behaviors. I used to compare what I ate to her and refused to eat alone or while she worked, meaning i would wait to have dinner with her at 9 pm, usually fainting in the process or having a B/P session. She often puts down what I eat, as her and I have different likes/dislikes. I need wheat bread for my GI issues, and i tend to eat a lot of dark meat chicken which she claims is \"fattening\" which is just so triggering. I am usually hungry at much different times of day than her, like she wont eat til 1 pm where as I make breakfast at 8 am as i feel i really need a schedule. This evening for dinner we were ready to sit and eat and she said she was also going to have a bit of smoked salmon with her meal (we made lasagna). I told her i wasn't really in the mood for that and id pass. she said i NEEDED to have some. I said, \"i dont want any though. i dont make you eat foods you dont want to eat.\" for example, she eats fish for dinner a few nights a week which im allergic to. i eat oats with peanut butter all the time which shes allergic to. she then told me she misses the old days when id make elaborate platters and host big dinners with the neighbors. i said \"those were binging and purging sessions. id wake up at 4 am, go for a run, than center my entire day around binging and purging. it was so painful. i dont miss any of that. i was going through a lot of pain.\" apparently she sees those meals as lovely family time even though she saw how bad itd get. id throw up at the table. i was feeling tortured in my own mind. she also makes fun of my body. i wore a sports bra today and she said i looked disgusting and skeletal. i said \"im practicing body confidence. it was really hard to put this on. i was trying to feel more confident in myself instead of covering my body since its changed.\" im not at my lowest weight anymore and trying to accept change. i really dont know what to do. i have mt friends and therapist in my corner encouraging me, but she is so toxic to my recovery. can anyone give me some advice?", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

TW, better to be safe than sorry.\n\nMy eating disorder gained a very, very tight grip on me in the past year, when I moved to university.  \nThere was a girl in the flat next door, who was clearly suffering for a long time with an eating disorder. She was frighteningly underweight. If I walked past the kitchen window (bottom floor) at an eating time, she would have an entire routine. Scales out, a full apron, always sat at the table and ate what looked like steamed spinach. I expressed to my then boyfriend how sad it was and how I wished I could help her, and that I could never imagine wanting to be like that (nobody does really, deep down).  \n\n\nI was on a weight loss journey at this time, starting university at about 170lbs. After Christmas break, I saw her once or twice. The time that resonated with me the most was when I was leaving the building and she was entering. The door was very heavy, objectively. Even I struggled with one hand. She pulled the door wide open, barely able to support it and smiled with such a kind smile. I went to hold it for her and asked her to go, I don't know how she managed. She wouldn't take that for an answer and made me go through first. After experiencing disordered eating, maybe it was a way for her to burn extra calories. I felt so bad for her holding the door for me, you could see it took everything.  \n\n\nNow by February, I never saw her and there was an empty room in that flat. Maybe it was wrong of me, but I assumed the worst. She was dangerously underweight, but I just hoped she was in inpatient or in care. I never saw her until the next academic year, today. I can't forget her appearance, and her gait. I was behind her in the library, watching as she stuffed 2 large pepsi max bottles into her coat pocket. She must have gotten better to return, but didn't look that much better. Hats off, getting better is a mountain of a task.\n\nNow the sad part, I saw her just as I returned from a shop on campus for my second diet coke to fight off hunger pains as I'm too scared to eat a 68 calorie apple and a 38 calorie bag of popcorn.   \nI never would've thought I'd be in a similar position a year on, funny how that works.\n\nAnyone had anything similar?", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

It is a very important tool that, if used with mindfulness and enough practice, can help you achieve your success goals in your ED.\n\nMost human beings are born with a natural tendency to feel happy, or at least content. Then, EDs intervene to change that situation, which tends to change again as someone starts recovery.\n\nThe miserable-happy scale is a range of emotions that goes from 0 to 10, where 0 is \"oh my God everything is so terrible I feel utterly desperate\" and 10 is \"I am as happy as it gets, love you all, shiny flowers and rainbows!!1\". Most recovered people, after attending long therapy sessions and putting new behaviours in place, tend to sit comfortably in the upper half of the scale - let's say around 7 to 8. But you don't want to be recovered, you want to succeed in your ED, so you want to be around the lower end of the scale. Ideally you should aim for a 0 every day.\n\nWhat does it mean in practice? Here's where the mindfulness is relevant. Keep a journal of your thoughts and your feelings every day, as much as you can. Try to detect patterns and see how you can improve them to better move towards your goals.\n\nYou should strive to turn any situation into something that makes you feel as horrible, shitty and miserable as it gets. Some examples:\n\n-you feel confident that today you might be able to eat breakfast, because you believe there's nothing wrong with that and nothing bad is going to happen? Now you have to counteract that thought. Try to spin those feelings negatively, e.g. by feeling utterly disgusting and going to cry in the bathroom over the fat rolls that have accumulated on your belly. Now you're closer to the 0 in the scale. Good job!\n\n-someone has told you that, after your recent weight gain and your therapy, you seem so much brighter and fun to have around. This brings you dangerously close to a high score in the scale! Be quick and counteract those positive thoughts. Convince yourself that this just means you've gotten fat as a horrible whale and everybody hates you.\n\n-you have challenged your fear of eating out and have joined your friends for a dinner in a restaurant you've wanted to try for so long but never allowed yourself to. Your friends are so happy to have you finally with them, and you feel like things might actually be starting to go in the right direction. You feel like you might have achieved something positive. Wrong! You want to succeed at your ED, remember? So, again, counteract those happy thoughts with something so terrible that you get immediately catapulted back to the lowest score in the scale. Say to yourself some demeaning, nasty shit, e.g. that those dinners out are going to make you the fattestest person in the whole history of the universe and you're a filthy pig that just deserves to be put into a circus and used as a laughing stock. \n\nPut an effort into constantly berating, bullying and belittling yourself, self-sabotaging yourself, never allowing yourself to recognize positive qualities in your person and your body, staunchly refusing any help, pushing away people that love you, things that you like, activities that you enjoy. Do not fall into those \"healthy\" thought patterns - it's just detrimental to your success.\n\nIf you are committed to follow these guidelines you will make it. You will finally manage to completely wreck your life and be absolutely miserable forever. **You will have succeeded at your ED**.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Every day for the last 10 years could pretty much be broken down in to a  'good day' (restricting calorie intake or sticking to a diet club plan) or a 'bad day' (eating whatever I wanted whenever I wanted). This cycle meant that I didn't ever feel that bad about 'binge' days - I knew I could always stick to a diet for the next few days or weeks and lose any weight I gained.\n\nAfter a long period of bingeing / careless eating / not sticking to any kind of diet plan, I put on around 28lbs, and desperate to get out of the diet / binge rut, I sought help from a therapist. We worked through my issues around food and I began a self-help programme to overcome binge eating. Initially hugely successful, I grew complacent, sure that I had overcome my eating disorder and I was finally healed - I found myself being able to eat like a 'normal person' for the first time in as long as I can remember. \n\nThe only problem was that, as I was eating 'normally', I wasn't losing any weight. This would be fine if I hadn't just put on so much weight after such a long period of bingeing. \n\nNow, I find myself in another rut. I want to lose weight; I'm deeply unhappy with the way I currently look. However, trying to lose weight throws me right back in to the diet / binge cycle.\n\nHow on earth do you overcome an eating disorder, like binge-eating disorder, while trying to also lose weight? I know the answer is that you should probably overcome your eating disorder first, but even when I'm totally at peace around what I eat, it doesn't change the fact that I want to lose weight.\n\nHas anyone found themselves in a similar position? How did you combat it?", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

The program got me to a good weight and allowed me to meet other people like me in the same situation. After the program I stopped obsessively worrying how much I ate and when I ate and whether I was healthy or not. That was something I really wanted, to have the headspace available to think about things more important and enjoyable than eating and food.\n\nThe bad: Now, however, I have been very upset about my body size. When I had a lot of restricting I didn't worry about body size very much, but now I constantly do. I have big stretch marks from getting up to weight. I question what my weight is supposed to be because the treatment facility and my outpatient dietician didn't agree on what my \"ideal weight\" is supposed to be. Because my AN was throughout most of high school I don't think I've ever been the right size for my height and what I am now is so much different from what I am used to my body looking like. Due to my concerns about my body size I become sad a lot, hating the way I look. Now rather than worrying about food all the time I just want to cry every night. Is this recovery? Is this sadness better than my AN symptoms were? I'm worried I'll slip back into AN because I'd rather constantly be worried and on edge than sad.\n\nA few notes: I've recently gone to college and do not have a therapist anymore. My insurance is crap for mental health and the only reason they covered the recovery program is because it was deemed \"medical\". I am currently looking to see if my college offers any better insurance or resources. I have also been really good about eating all my meals when here at school, but I'm now questioning if it is worth it because of my body size issues.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

I think it started before that, but that\u2019s when I distinctly remember not eating for extended periods of time. Most days I would only eat very small portions of dinner, and since my parents worked all day I didn\u2019t have to worry about getting caught during the day. At the time I was overweight, but I didn\u2019t care too much about it. I wasn\u2019t eating because I was depressed, not because I hated myself. \n\nThe summer before my sophomore year I decided I wanted to get healthy, and at this point I had a faint notion that I might have an E.D, but ignored it. I started working out and dieting severely, far below the calorie goal I needed to be at for my age, but I didn\u2019t care. I lost weight pretty quickly and gained muscle, and people were encouraging me because they didn\u2019t know the extent of my dieting issues. By Christmas of that year, however, I noticed that I was having increasingly worsening health issues, I was exhausted and nauseous all the time, and later I would find out that I was severely deficient in many vitamins and nutrients. \n\nFlash forward to this summer, and I weighed well within a normal range for my height, was only working out a few times a week instead of every night, eating a sufficient amount of calories and slowly weening off calorie charting. However when school started again, my eating schedule was thrown off, so I had to compensate by eating more in the evenings. \n\nAt first, this worked out fine for me. I didn\u2019t gain or lose any weight and I felt healthy, but some of the thoughts I\u2019d had the year before started to creep back in. At the tome I was busy enough to where I could distract myself from them, but slowly over the past few months my confidence has dropped to the point where I hate seeing a mirror. I\u2019m taking a metabolism boosting drink. Some days I eat very little and some days I eat just under what\u2019s normal for my age and height. Ive started body checking again, I pull my fat around and I pinch myself. I hate my body again, despite not having gained or lost any weight. \n\nI don\u2019t want to live like this again. I can\u2019t put my parents through that, I can\u2019t put my body through that, but I don\u2019t know how to get these thoughts to stop, because every few days I have a good day, where I eat a normal amount and I\u2019m confident in myself, but then the next day I look in the mirror and see only the worst in myself and decide I can\u2019t eat as much to make up for it. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do, and I\u2019m ashamed to tell anyone.

I tried to track my calories even though I knew that number in my counting app was wrong because it doesn't allow you to count if you set your age under 18. Usually I track when I've just ate a big amount of cookies or other junk with no label on it so i can't normally track. And in order to not gain weight after those binges I ate very little or didn't eat at all. It was the way I turned underweight in about a year. I recognized that I might have an ED because of anxiety, obsessive thoughts and fear of gaining weight. I learned about EDs and other stuff as well.

I sick of my safe foods, nothing tastes \"good enough\" to eat, small sugary treats are feeling like binges, I'm burning 90% of my caloric intake and still panicking over weight gain, I'm spending literal hours watching recipe/meal prep vids that I know for a fact I'll never make and none of my clothes fit properly anymore....  I'm also getting mean with the people around me, like my boyfriend who is nothing but nice/supportive. My ED/BPD combo is making me split on him and I don't know how to stop... I feel like the only thing that'll put a stop to this ED spiral is treatment, but I just spent 3 months in the psych ward/rehab and have no desire to be institutionalized again, and to be frank ED treatment sounds like the scariest thing I could ever imagine. \n\nI'm just so fucking sick and tired of this disorder. I hate to admit it because I feel like, to be truly \"sick\", I need to put the survival of my disorder before my own, but I've lived with this thing for 13 years and I'm straight exhausted. I know I'll never like the way my body looks, thin or recovered, so I think it's time for me to start helping my body function so I can do the things I love like write poetry, play cello, read books, make collages... right now I don't have energy, motivation or drive to do any of this and it makes me so sad because there is a simple fix (recovery), but I'm just too scared to take the leap...\n\nRight now, my situation really sucks but I'm willing to try out a few \"options\" to halt this spiral. I want to challenge myself to eat a \"normal\" caloric intake (i.e. 2000 cals) for one single day, just to try it out. When I left rehab (for my addiction) three weeks ago, my counsellor told me I should \"try out\" normal eating, even if its just for a short time. I haven't actually followed through with this yet because the thought of willingly eating like that scares the living shit out of me. On top if that, I have no meal support because I live on my own and I have no one to really hold me accountable for eating \"right\".  \n\nI think my greatest fear in this is feeling like my ED isn't valid because I want to make the conscious choice to \"eat well\", even if its just for one day. I know its a recovery choice, and I know that I am still quite sick, but the feeling of \"doing this to myself\" (aka feeding myself properly) just feels so overwhelming...\n\nI guess what I'm asking is this: Does anyone have tips on how to go about food challenges while living alone? Are there foods that are easier to incorporate/digest/stomach for this kind of situation? And if you've done this yourself, how did you deal with the overwhelm that comes after?

{"post_id": "dnemao", "created_utc": 1572100397, "title": "Binges in recovery - a discussion", "author": "internerderner2", "self_text": "I've just had a debate with some posters about binges during recovery from a restrictive ED. They argued that binging is in itself always a problematic, unhealthy behaviour that must be avoided. They also argued that the idea of listening to your body is also damaging in recovery, as it can lead to binges and other poor choices.\n\nI do not agree with this view.\n\nI do acknowledge that binges are a disordered behaviour - they certainly aren't something people without EDs engage in on a daily basis, and they are always a symptom of some other issues, be them physiological (read: starvation) or psychological. They are an extreme behaviour that only happens under extreme circumstances. What I do not agree with is that they are **always** problematic and \"bad\" in themselves: on the contrary, I do believe they not only are normal - and that's just a plain statistical reality - but also, under certain circumstances, even \"appropriate\" and \"okay\".\n\nA person without an ED, when faced with prolonged food scarcity and starvation, is going to binge at some point. This is just a given. He's also probably going to experience symptoms such as intense physical discomfort, disconnection between \"fullness\" and \"mental satisfaction\" and even a sense of loss of control over food. In the Minnesota starvation study, which I am sure everyone of you knows, the subjects had no ED yet experienced all of these issues. They wanted to eat and eat and eat, well past the point of their stomach capacity (which had been reduced by starvation), and felt like they were unable to stop. Over time this urge disappeared with continued eating and weight restoration and the two biological signals became connected again. Many recovered people also had the same experiences. I've seen normal people who weren't even underweight but had just lost weight experience the same as well.\n\nThe difference between them and the average person with a restrictive ED is mainly the mental attitude around the event. That person is much more likely to experience intense feelings of guilt and shame, to think that he/she has done something completely horrible and messed up which absolutely needs to be \"undone\" at any costs, thus starting the good ol binge restrict or binge purge cycle. A person without an ED is probably just going to brush it off. What I do believe here is that, in order to avoid creating that cycle, avoiding these binges is not the only approach possible; another approach might very well be letting them happen and trying to tackle and reframe the mental response to them.\n\nA common reply here is what about refeeding syndrome? Problem is, refeeding syndrome is really only a risk for very underweight people who basically haven't eaten anything for days. If you're not super scary underweight and you've eaten anything resembling a decent amount of food for the past few days you can usually assume you're out of the danger zone.\n\nSo, my point is. Provided there are no ongoing objective medical risks, and there is sufficient psychological support, why would binges in recovery be ALWAYS such a bad thing? Why would having regular meals ALWAYS be intrinsically \"better\" than just letting the binges happen (if such an urge is present) and waiting for hunger signals to naturally regulate themselves, as it has been proven to happen?\n\nI have dealt with different professionals in my own ED experience, and their replies were always different. Some just said \"you're becoming bulimic and that's bad\", thus basically reinforcing my ED fears, while others had a softer approach and said that these binges were only normal in my situation.\n\nIn my case, I have to say that when I was at my lowest weight the binges probably saved my life, as they not only helped me regain some weight - and the brain functions, as well as the improved physical health, that came with it - but they also were the wake up call that made me realize I had an ED. So, in that respect, I could even frame them as an \"healthy\" response - it was my non-ED brain taking over, screaming that I urgently needed to eat loads of food in order to survive.\n\nThe condition that people with a restrictive ED force themselves into is highly abnormal. Why should an equally highly abnormal response be automatically stigmatized only because it doesn't happen to people who don't have that highly abnormal condition in the first place?\n\nSome very important points:\n\n-I do NOT say binging should be actively encouraged or promoted, as I believe it increases the risk of relapse and developing of bulimia in some individuals. I do NOT say it's the best form of recovery and everyone should just stuff his face forever and get over it. That's not my point. I do believe that ensuring regular adequate nutrition is the best path for recovery, also because it's the least distressing one.\n\n-I do acknowledge that BED is a severe issue and my post pertains to restrictive EDs. There are recovering alcoholics for which even a single beer is problematic, but that doesn't mean getting drunk is bad for 100% of the population worldwide. There are diabetics who need to watch their food carefully and healthy teenagers who can wolf down multiple slices of cheesecake in one setting without anyone giving a fuck. Recovery is an individual issue, and just because there are people struggling with certain issues that doesn't mean those issues are relevant for everyone else.\n\n-I am not a Fat or HAES activist and I absolutely don't buy their deeply flawed, misinformed rhetoric.\n\n-I have an ED myself, and a very active one, so it's not like I am mentally okay with binges or anything regarding food for that matter. I am just genuinely trying to analyze the subject from the most neutral point of view possible.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

{"post_id": "dnhjcx", "created_utc": 1572113626, "title": "Binges in recovery - a discussion", "author": "internerderner2", "self_text": "Repost of what I wrote on another sub, thought it could be relevant here as well.\n\nI've just had a debate with some posters about binges during recovery from a restrictive ED. They argued that binging is in itself always a problematic, unhealthy behaviour that must be avoided. They also argued that the idea of listening to your body is also damaging in recovery, as it can lead to binges and other poor choices. Generally speaking, it seems to me that not only among ED sufferers but also among the professionals that are supposed to cure them there's this absolute fear of binges, which are seen as the ultimate black evil, the worst thing that can happen, the tragedy no one even dares to talk about.\n\nI do not agree with this view.\n\nI do acknowledge that binges are a disordered behaviour - they certainly aren't something people without EDs engage in on a daily basis, and they are always a symptom of some other issues, be them physiological (read: starvation) or psychological. They are an extreme behaviour that only happens under extreme circumstances. What I do not agree with is that they are always problematic and \"bad\" in themselves: on the contrary, I do believe they not only are normal - and that's just a plain statistical reality - but also, under certain circumstances, even \"appropriate\" and \"okay\".\n\nA person without an ED, when faced with prolonged food scarcity and starvation, is going to binge at some point. This is just a given. He's also probably going to experience symptoms such as intense physical discomfort, disconnection between \"fullness\" and \"mental satisfaction\" and even a sense of loss of control over food. In the Minnesota starvation study, which I am sure everyone of you knows, the subjects had no ED yet experienced all of these issues. They wanted to eat and eat and eat, well past the point of their stomach capacity (which had been reduced by starvation), and felt like they were unable to stop. Over time this urge disappeared with continued eating and weight restoration and the two biological signals became connected again. Many recovered people also had the same experiences. I've seen normal people who weren't even underweight but had just lost weight experience the same as well.\n\nThe difference between them and the average person with a restrictive ED is mainly the mental attitude around the event. That person is much more likely to experience intense feelings of guilt and shame, to think that he/she has done something completely horrible and messed up which absolutely needs to be \"undone\" at any costs, thus starting the good ol binge restrict or binge purge cycle. A person without an ED is probably just going to brush it off. What I do believe here is that, in order to avoid creating that cycle, avoiding these binges is not the only approach possible; another approach might very well be letting them happen and trying to tackle and reframe the mental response to them.\n\nA common reply here is what about refeeding syndrome? Problem is, refeeding syndrome is really only a risk for very underweight people who basically haven't eaten anything for days. If you're not super scary underweight and you've eaten anything resembling a decent amount of food for the past few days you can usually assume you're out of the danger zone.\n\nSo, my point is. Provided there are no ongoing objective medical risks, and there is sufficient psychological support, why would binges in recovery be ALWAYS such a bad thing? Why would having regular meals ALWAYS be intrinsically \"better\" than just letting the binges happen (if such an urge is present) and waiting for hunger signals to naturally regulate themselves, as it has been proven to happen?\n\nI have dealt with different professionals in my own ED experience, and their replies were always different. Some just said \"you're becoming bulimic and that's bad\", thus basically reinforcing my ED fears, while others had a softer approach and said that these binges were only normal in my situation.\n\nIn my case, I have to say that when I was at my lowest weight the binges probably saved my life, as they not only helped me regain some weight - and the brain functions, as well as the improved physical health, that came with it - but they also were the wake up call that made me realize I had an ED. So, in that respect, I could even frame them as an \"healthy\" response - it was my non-ED brain taking over, screaming that I urgently needed to eat loads of food in order to survive.\n\nThe condition that people with a restrictive ED force themselves into is highly abnormal. Why should an equally highly abnormal response be automatically stigmatized only because it doesn't happen to people who don't have that highly abnormal condition in the first place?\n\nSome very important points:\n\n-I do NOT say binging should be actively encouraged or promoted, as I believe it increases the risk of relapse and developing of bulimia in some individuals. I do NOT say it's the best form of recovery and everyone should just stuff his face forever and get over it. That's not my point. I do believe that ensuring regular adequate nutrition is the best path for recovery, also because it's the least distressing one.\n\n-I do acknowledge that BED is a severe issue and my post pertains to restrictive EDs. There are recovering alcoholics for which even a single beer is problematic, but that doesn't mean getting drunk is bad for 100% of the population worldwide. There are diabetics who need to watch their food carefully and healthy teenagers who can wolf down multiple slices of cheesecake in one setting without anyone giving a fuck. Recovery is an individual issue, and just because there are people struggling with certain issues that doesn't mean those issues are relevant for everyone else.\n\n-I am not a Fat or HAES activist and I don't share their rhetoric.\n\n-I have an ED myself, and a very active one, so it's not like I am mentally okay with binges or anything regarding food for that matter. I am just genuinely trying to analyze the subject from the most neutral point of view possible.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I'm just looking for some perspective", "author": "784684654", "self_text": "I don't know if this is okay to post here.  I know trigger warnings aren't a thing in this sub, but I don't want to hurt anyone.  Honestly I've been afraid to reach out for support on this because I don't know how to ask for help for this in a way that isn't triggering to people and I feel really fucking alone.  \n\nBasically, lipomas are small tumors made of fat.  They're typically benign/noncancerous.  Most people will never get one.  Of that small percentage of people who do get one, most are unlikely to get more.  Very rarely, some people get a bunch (like 50-100+).  From what I've read, they're typically triggered by injury and weight gain (IF the person already has the genetics for it, and most people don't).  My point here is that this is probably as unlikely to happen to you as getting struck by lightning.  Please don't worry.  \n\nIn my teens, I noticed 3 pea-sized bumps behind my ear.  They hurt occasionally in a stabby way, but it wasn't a big deal.  Upon going through my medical records, I found a mention of my doctor writing down that they were lipoma.  \n\nAt ages 27-28, I briefly gained weight.  My BMI went from 18 to 24.  At age 29, I noticed both sides of my neck swelling and assumed it was from spending long hours at my desk with bad posture, so I started icing my neck.  \n\nThe swelling on one side went down, but the other side didn't.  I felt a round thing under the skin.  It f'n hurt all the time.  It was diagnosed as a lipoma.  \n\nI read that it was caused by weight gain, and my heart just sank.  I've been so restrictive with food my entire fucking life because I was afraid of letting go of control or of letting myself do anything in an undisciplined way, and my first *big* slip-up resulted in a fucking tumor?  Are you fucking serious?\n\n(sorry if this is poor or unacceptable language... - I've never actually talked to anyone but my girlfriend about my eating disorder, and I've been afraid of most ED recovery groups for reasons.  I was diagnosed anorexic twice by GPs as a teen, but never got treatment)  \n\nAlmost immediately after I got my lipoma diagnosis (around Christmas 2018), my family experienced two traumatic deaths and my living situation turned insane (bad housemates are the worst).  Stress and depression have always left me feeling out of control, so I backslid hard.  I restricted hard.  I got out of the habit of eating, and got back into the habit of just distracting myself into forgetting.  It made me feel better for a while when everything else felt like it sucked.  I lost all of the weight I had gained and then some.  It felt too good to be restricting again.  \n\nThen I had my lipoma removed surgically, and my pain levels finallllyyyy went down.  I could actually sleep through a night and I wasn't just beat down all the time.  Until the moment it was removed, I didn't realize how bad the pain actually was.  I felt like a person again and cried happy tears to my surgeon when she called to check on me a few days later.  She asked how the pain was, I told her I didn't even need tylenol because the stitches felt about 10 times better than the lipoma did.  \n\nAbout three weeks later I noticed familiar dry aching feeling in my shoulder.  I blamed the stitches healing.  Five weeks later, its hurting bad again and I can feel a bump under the stitches.  This is when I realized my fucking lipoma grew back.  My dermatologist confirmed it, and is referred me to a general surgeon.  I was restricting and absolutely on a caloric deficit the entire time I was healing.    \n\nI'm about three months post-surgery now and its hurting bad.  I noticed a new pain in my collar bone this morning, and felt it to find a new lipoma on my collar bone - and I'm livid about it.  I'm terrified that this is going to be my life now: blaming myself for slipping up and letting my weight climb -once- and giving myself painful tumors, and being afraid to eat because I know they essentially breed in body fat.  I know I won't backslide too far because my girlfriend keeps an eye on what I eat, but I want to stop *wanting* to backslide.  I want to figure out how to make peace with my weight and my fear of these tumors (and of removal simply not working or making things worse).  \n\nI know pain really makes me see this all through a lens of doom and depression, and that it isn't actually that bad.  Its going to be months until I can actually get to a doctor again (moved to a new county and I'm way too broke for health insurance, especially since pain is limiting how much I can actually work)\n\nSorry if this is the wrong sub for this, or if I've offended anyone with this post.

I would allow myself to indulge but would never make a habit out of it, and was able to balance it out with exercise and the majority of my days being good days.\n\nBut over the past 8 months or so, I feel that I have lost all self discipline. I have been neglecting my health, both by not exercising and by eating like garbage. \n\nI had a really bad day today in the kitchen, and I feel awful now. I want to take back control, and get back to the weight range I feel best in. I want my pants to fit again and to feel healthy again.\n\nI\u2019ve done it before, and I honestly don\u2019t know why I am keeping myself from exercising that discipline like I have in the past. \n\nI currently weigh 23 pounds more than what my ideal weight is, and I want to get a handle on it before it becomes even more out of control. And I think it starts by admitting that I am a binge eater. \n\nThanks for reading, it feels good to get this all out there and admit to myself that I have a problem. \n\nAny advice, criticism, encouragement, and whatever else is welcome and accepted.\n\nEdit: sentence structure", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

It got out around 12:30 am. I had been thinking for most of the day about eating. Turning the idea over in my mind. I sort of just let myself autopilot myself to the store on the drive back home, which was long. \n\nI spent $52 on food...\n\nI cried to my girlfriend over the phone about it in the morning. I threw what remained away, but I regretted it after a few hours. I thought about how I wanted to dig it out of the dumpster and eat it.. like an animal.. I ended up at the store that night. My girlfriend had left to go up north a few hours before and didn\u2019t have service, so I couldn\u2019t reach out and she wasn\u2019t around to be with me and keep me from eating..\n\nI don\u2019t know how to do this anymore. The remainder of last nights food is by my door. I want to throw it away but I also want to eat it and feel the taste in my mouth. \n\nI went so long. It\u2019s supposed to get easier not harder. I\u2019m so ashamed of having to start from day 0 again. I\u2019m so ashamed of spending so much money on food. I\u2019m upset and hurt that my girlfriend left me to go away when she knew I needed her. I hate myself for having an eating disorder. I just want to stop. I don\u2019t want to think about food the way I do. I don\u2019t want to desire food the way I do. \n\nIt was so easy. Some days were a challenge but I knew that I wasn\u2019t going to eat. Why is this happening. Why do I want this. \n\nI\u2019m just falling apart all over again and I have nobody that can help me or listen to me", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I don't know how could I possibly let this happen to me. \n\nI had Anorexia, I would restrict and then binge but would keep the food down and deal with it. Now I am regularly purging after every binge - it's not a daily thing, but I am afraid it might become a daily thing. \n\nI can't look at myself in the mirror. I can't touch my face. I can't stand that I have to live with this constant reminder of what I am doing to myself. I am scared that I am fucked beyond hope and that the damage can't be reversed at this point. Everytime I swear to myself that whatever happens, even if I have the biggest binge ever, I won't purge. Anything but purging. Yet today I binged, then I freaked out and the response was just so natural.\n\nI am in a foreign country and don't have any support. My family is away and since I am moving often due to my activity I can't access therapy both because it's in a language I don't master well enough and because logistics just wouldn't work - I need to be constantly monitored and checked and I can't do it until I settle down somewhere. A couple of friends know but they don't know what to do, and my mom only knows about restriction and binges - I am too ashamed to share the vomit part with her, it would just be too much for her and for myself to handle.\n\nI have been purging on-off for barely a year, never more than once or twice a week and with months-long \"breaks\" in between. Yet I can already feel my teeth becoming more yellow and sensitive, my throat hurting, my digestion worsening. I had always teeth issues well before the ED and I regularly see a dentist; last time I went there for a visit it was in September and she apparently said everything was fine (she doesn't know about the ED), but I am so scared that at some point the day will come that she will notice and things will start to really go down the drain. Two months can already do quite some damage.\n\nI feel lost, hopeless. I am not this, I don't like this, this is not me, my identity, what I value and stand for. It disgusts me and I keep telling myself that I can still stop before it gets too bad to be reversed, yet I don't act towards that goal and I keep spiraling down instead. I don't know what to do - I can't leave my job, I am not going to explain why but let's just say it would only make things worse. Yet I know I need urgent help.\n\nI hate myself for having allowed this to happen. I am not, and I repeat I am not going to commit suicide but honestly it seems the best solution sometimes, in days like this when I feel so completely disgusted and sorry with myself, so incapable of dealing with my thoughts and controlling my actions.\n\nAnd all of this for what. To achieve what. To maintain a weight that is too low anyways. To avoid seeing the scale go up tomorrow. Like it matters. Like anyone gives a shit. Like it's going to be that big of a deal. Before the ED my weight was higher than this, it was healthy and I didn't care. Now I do, even if I don't want to. \n\nWhen I was only restricting, or binging without purging, I was unhappy but at least I was physically healthy and the potential damage was too far away for me to actually see and taste it.

We had a good conversation, and I could relate to her a lot, which was helping me feel less alone, in a good way.  Her parents found out, and called the school I go to.  We'll call this friend F. \n\nLong story short, the vice principal (VP) sat me down and eventually called my parents (more on this later).  Now though, I'm apparently on a list he made of 'at risk' students which means I'll probably have to speak to the counselor, which I really don't want to do (especially because of how the school handled this the last time).\n\nLast year when the vice principal sat me down to talk to me, he was like \"You aren't fat, because you're tall\", and then tried to have a conversation with me that went like this: \n\nVP: \"Did you know I used to be bigger?  I lost 30 pounds by eating oatmeal for breakfast instead of just coffee.  You can't lose weight by not eating\".  \n\nMe: \"....\"\n\nVP: \"You can ask your parents this too, I'm sure they'll agree because it's true.\"\n\nMe: \\*in my head\\* \"then why the fuck did I lose weight by not eating?\"\n\nVP: \"By talking to F, you were enabling both of you, and if she gets worse it could be your fault.\"\n\nMe: \"Ok.\"\n\nVP: You aren't in trouble, you know.  \n\nMe: \"Okay, can I leave now?\"\n\nVP: **\"No, you leave when I tell you to.\"**\n\nLed me to honestly have the most serious suicidal thoughts I've ever had, and seriously triggered me for a while after.  And now that he made an 'at risk' list (that another friend told me I'm on), apparently I'll have to go talk to the school counselor.  May be slightly better than talking to the VP, but I don't want anything to do with the school, *especially* because I am ready to recover, and am sure the school will do much more harm than any help.  \n\nTL;DR: Being forced to see the school counselor by the school.  Don't want schools help because last time, they were a large trigger, and made me feel guilty for having an ED and relating with other people who had it (I never encouraged any of it).", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I work at a popular fast food restaurant, and I get free food there. As a poor college kid who does fifteen hour days with school plus work, I try to take advantage of the food provided. I spent about an hour last night calculating the different calories of the items I like, and what customizations I could do to make them even better. I was going to start calorie counting again today-- not as a restriction method, but to help control my urge to binge.\n\nI had it in my head what items I was going to have for lunch. Around 5-600 calories for the meal. Decent, and I might even be willing to let myself have a light dinner at night. I was content.\n\nI work mornings to afternoons, so halfway through my shift the menu switches and we have to toss the breakfast items. My coworker asks me if I want a couple leftover pastries (160 cal for two), and a hashbrown (160 cal for one). I'm weird about saying no to offered grub, so I oblige. Slight guilt but nothing major.\n\nMy break rolls around and I order my food with my desired customizations, but in my rush I input what I want a little confusingly. See, I don't eat meat, and I haven't in eight years, but I usually take a meat-filled item and replace it with whatever vegetable I'm feeling that day. I do just this, but unfortunately my coworker read it wrong and just added the vegetable without taking out the meat.\n\nHalfway through this item (since I'm a fucking pig and eat within seconds), I notice the shredded chicken. I freak the fuck out, and start panicking. I immediately throw out the remainder of my lunch, and rush to the restroom to purge, purge, purge. Afterwards I feel my common post-purge depression, and slump to the back where my manager asks if I'm okay. I'm not. I feel like shit. Both physically because meat makes me sick nowadays, and mentally due to eating meat and due to purging in the same fucking bathroom that drug addicts come to OD in. And I mention I ate something that doesn't work for me, and eventually I mention it was meat by mistake. My manager tells me it's all mental and not to worry about it (he's an ex-vegan). Yeah, buddy, tell that to the me five minutes ago that was slumped over the damned toilet trying to get everything out. Or tell that to my current stomach ache. Whatever floats your boat. Because it doesn't make you sick, it can't make me sick, eh?\n\nI end up finishing my shift okay, and actually stay an extra couple hours because we're slammed and short-staffed. I'm now working a ten-hour shift, which I have absolutely no issues with, but it was exhausting. After my shift, I'm starving and the incident earlier inspired me to want to just eat something I enjoy (calorically-intense af tho), and my manager tells me to make whatever and enjoy as a thank you for offering to stay longer. I make my two favorite items, and grab a couple more of those pastries in a moment of weakness lol. I eat my food in the back for a while after my shift and when I go to dip my manager asks me what I had, to make conversation I suppose, and I told him; he mumbles, \"Wow, you must have been hungry. Usually I only eat one thing.\"\n\nI grimaced. Yeah, he's right. I'm pretty fucking gross, eh? It was a shit ton of food, to be fair.\n\nNow sad again, I leave the store and wander to a cafe I haven't checked out before. I grab a cookie and a coffee, and I snack on it. I then grab two more pastries as I'm leaving (I meant to only buy a glazed doughnut, but she gave me an apple fritter for free in addition) and I plan on eating those tonight with the rest of this shitty bottle of wine I have. Then maybe throwing it all up again. Or maybe just crying myself to sleep thinking about the pimples and the rolls I'm going to develop in the coming days.\n\nFor reference, I'm a 5'3\" girl that weighs 135-ish lbs.

In the midst of academic stress, a toxic relationship, insecurity, extreme body dysmorphia and just general depression, I found comfort in my ADHD meds that promised hunger suppression - It was such a relief, \"FINALLY\", I thought , \"something I can control\".\n\n At 17 I started to restrict my eating and I dropped 20 lbs in less than two months, finally weighing 95 lbs. I couldn't see myself clearly. I would always see my skinny friends as significantly skinnier than me and looking back, at pictures from that time, it is obvious that I was significantly skinnier than all of them.\n\nHow did I get passed this? I moved and went to University. I found great friends and an environment that I THRIVED in. I was finally in control of so many aspects of my life.\n\nOr so I thought...\n\n**I think that I felt like I had rid myself of the disorder because I made so much progress so quickly.** \n\nI still subconsciously seek comfort in the \"appetite suppressant\" side effects of my meds during times of stress, like during midterm season or during finals. It's like it's my safety blanket when I feel out of control.\n\nI recently realized that the only reason that I allow myself to not care about what I eat (especially during the summer) is because I rely on my Adderall to give me those boundaries. During the summer, when i'm generally medication-free, I drink and eat what I want and gain more weight than I am comfortable with. The thoughts that go through my mind during those times are along these lines: \" Don't worry, you'll get back on your medication. With Adderall's help, you'll go on a fast for a few days, and all of this will go away. It's just temporary, you can get rid of it. You've done it before\". Then I continue to laugh with my friend, seemingly care-free. But i'm not care-free, am i? My weight does stress me out. I do think about it all the time. \n\nSometimes, I find myself missing my ED...\n\nI genuinely thought that I was passed this, simply because I chose to ignore the signs since they aren't  \"as bad\" as they once were.\n\nWhat do you guys think?

I've been feeling awful about it but am keeping at it instead of giving into the (frequent, but decreasing) urge to purge or restrict again. \n\nMy boyfriend has been so supportive throughout all of this, but even though I believe him when he says he'll love me no matter my weight, it's hard to drill into my head, and my ED thoughts that fat makes me less worthy of living and being loved will not let up. \n\n(Spoilers)\nIn the new season of Bojack Horseman, one character, Diane, struggles with depression. When her boyfriend suggests that she at least try the antidepressant pills that her doctor recommended, one reason she gives for not wanting to take them is that she did once before, and she gained weight. Her depression is killing her though; she's miserable, unproductive, and disorganized. Much like I was in the depths of my ED.\n\nAnyway, her boyfriend has to travel for work, so they go long distance for a little while. The next time we see them, Diane is meeting her boyfriend at the airport to welcome him home. She's gained a significant amount of weight, but she's smiling. It's clearly implied that she took the antidepressants. The shot cuts to her boyfriend, and he doesn't even have a moment of hesitation. He just smiles.\n\nA real partner is going to care about my wellbeing more than if I have a double chin, if my stomach sticks out, if I have grabbable fat. It's still me, and just because I ate doesn't mean I'm taking up space I don't deserve. He wants me and he wants me to be happy. I believe it and seeing an example of it was just some nice reassurance. I know I'm not going to stop obsessing over my body, at least not in the foreseeable future, but seeing this example of love in the media just provided a little more affirmation in the right direction for me.\n\nThanks for reading, just wanted to get this off of my chest.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

Feeling scared but trying to be curious and compassionate.", "author": "TeenageGingerTurtle", "self_text": "I thought I was going to avoid the whole extreme hunger thing, and just slowly increase and slowly gain until hitting my happy weight like I did last time I recovered. Note - last time I recovered, I did it to the ED's rules and restrictions (only safe foods, never too much, restrictive mindset, looots of compensatory movement), hence the relapse! However, after literally 2 years wasted on the pursuit of comfortable weight gain (which doesn't happen with a restrictive ED - I actually lost in those 2 years rather than gain) I am so done with this quasi state. Been reading Tabitha Farrar's book \"Rehabilitate, Rewire, Recover\" and following Stephanie Buttermore's \"all in\" journey, and have realized that I have not pushed myself AT ALL these past two years to eat more than what my body is asking for, and I have not pushed myself much to eat fear foods. My body has determined this current unhealthy weight to be its homeostasis. \n\nSo, these past two weeks, I have been trying to tune into my mental hunger, which at the start was stronger than my physical hunger, and also push myself to eat until complete satiation and choose \"scarier\" foods like bagels, rice, pasta, vegan cheese and ice cream, etc. And let me tell you... my appetite is starting to pick up for more, now that I am actually feeding myself. Eating what I am right now is already uncomfortable, and the aspect of more scares me. However, I am trying to internalize some of what Tabitha says: if you are comfortable in recovery, you are doing it wrong. And, there is no such thing as too much food when trying to nutritionally rehabilitate. \n\nAlso, I will be honest.... It's a little liberating. And I like feeling energetic, and able to concentrate on art and school. I even went for pizza and cocktails this weekend and it was only half as scary as it would have been a few months ago. I was able to have a good night with coworkers and not restrict before/after in compensation.\n\nTrying to remain curious about where this appetite is going rather than judgemental.

I have severe anxiety and depression but this is different and beyond horrible. I can\u2019t eat without having heart palpitations or nausea. I\u2019m still eating though. But soon I have no appetite and am only drinking water and protein shakes and bread and almond butter. My gums and teeth are horrible looking and I can\u2019t sleep at all. I\u2019m not leaving the house , isolating and crying all the time. I want to die. I try to find help but my mom just tells me \u201c to eat\u201d and \u201c watch movies\u201d I have a psychiatrist but he says he doesn\u2019t treat this. No ED therapists have appts for 2 months. My GI doctor is useless. I start having symptoms of Anorexia. I call 911 but I\u2019m afraid of being locked up in a psych ward. Finally tonight I couldn\u2019t take it anymore \nNote: I have a therapy dog I haven\u2019t seen in over a month who is my world but I can\u2019t take care of him right now( he\u2019s with my ex BF his dad)  and I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll never see him again :-(\nI started having  scary symptoms : itching, hair loss, body pain ( I also have Fibromyalgia) I don\u2019t want to die. I called 911 after I tried to eat some small meals  and I got awful stomach cramps/pain and had to go to the bathroom and  then almost passed out.  I was dehydrated. I guess water doesn\u2019t work.\nAlso the thought of another sleepless night in a nonstop panic attack was unbearable. I\u2019m sorry this is so long but I have been reading this sub for 2 weeks looking for help and now that I\u2019m in the hospital I\u2019m so scared and I have no one to talk to. Thank you so much. I know this isn\u2019t \na \u201c conventional \u201c ED but I know they come in all shapes and sizes. Sending love and hugs to everyone who needs it. You are all wonderful. \nThank you.", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

I QUIT A PASSION I LOVED BECAUSE I DIDNT LIKE HAVING MUSCLE-Y FUCKING LEGS, FOR GODS FUCKING SAKE WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME.\n\nand in addition to this, around the same time my mum and her ex boyfriend (who, may i add, i think has given me some mindset problems; like i\u2019ve never gotten on with my mum because of him, he teared down my confidence, make me scared to share my emotions and feelings, and made me feel isolated from everyone else. when i told my mum this - respectfully, cause it was a touchy subject - she would scream at me which kinda made me more shy of sharing my thoughts and feelings, which is probably why i\u2019m discussing my body image issues on reddit when i have literally told no one about this). wow i went off on a tangent, but anyways, my mum and her ex had a messy break up back in september and it kinda dragged out and to make a long story short, at this time i would get in from school; feel depressed because pf hormones i guess; be hungry as shit; my mum would say she could her voices shouting over the road from our house (where he ex lived oops)(also: this made everyone think she was crazy because who cant hear even the loudest of shouting when there is a busy main road in between the houses); she would shout at me for not being able to hear the voices; i would sit in my room alone and feel guilty and unable to share my thoughts; then my sister would get home from her boyfriends at 10pm and shout at me for not helping our mum even though MY SISTER DIDN\u2019T KNOW HALF OF THE SITUATION BECAUSE SHE WAS NEVER HOME, AND SHE WOULDN\u2019T LISTEN TO ME WHEN I TRIED TO COMMUNICATE HOW TERRIFYING IT IS TO A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD WHEN AN AUTHORITATIVE FIGURE IS SHOUTING AT YOU FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO HEAR VOICES.\n\nto summarise, i was in a bad situation and i think i might of been depressed lol.\n\nbut the point of that tangent, i moved in with my dad because my mum wasn\u2019t stable at the time.\n\nnow this may all seem irrelevant but this is probably the most important part, because at my dads he was lowkey concerned about my eating but like wouldn\u2019t straight up say it. like he accepted i wouldn\u2019t eat breakfast because i said it made me feel sick. but his girlfriend (who was probably more concerned that him because i assume she gets what its like to be a teenage girl and wanting to lose weight to feel like we fit in), she would buy me food to eat after school (healthy food, but still food) and i always ate it because i have no self control and felt bad and didn\u2019t want to disappoint them i guess.\n\nbecause my metabolism (i\u2019m not a doctor i\u2019m just making educated guesses at this point) wasn\u2019t used to much food at all i put on some weight on my legs which pretty much brought me back to square one. the muscle that was no longer in use had now turned into fat and i was putting on weight. so now my legs weren\u2019t even just big they were also JIGGLY FOR CHRISTS SAKE.\n\nmind you i still wasn\u2019t even particularly fat, like i had a flat stomach, tiny waist, but big legs. i wasn\u2019t fat, and i knew it, but i FELT fat.\n\nmy living arrangement and weight gain stayed the same until about may, by then i was visiting my mum on fridays to saturdays and she was becoming more stable. and my dad was getting an extension (which if you have ever had one you will know they\u2019re a nightmare). so i had to go and stay with my mum for a while. by now my body was used to much more food that previously, i was eating two solid meals per day, but would also like binge eat a lot during the day. i tried to purge, but found out i have very little of a gag reflex when i\u2019m in control, like i would literally sit bu the toilet with my fingers pretty damn far down my throats pressing hard on the back of my tongue and nothing was happening, i was pretty fucking devastated say the least.\n\nbut nonetheless i moved back into my mums house, planning to cut down on the food big time. but i couldn\u2019t, and it was literally so heart breaking and frustrating to me.\n\nif you couldn\u2019t tell food and weight was all i could think about now, and i knew it was bad.\n\ni would constantly tell myself, \u2018okay next week only one meal like old times,\u2019 and when i couldn\u2019t control myself it would be, \u2018okay no food at all next week,\u2019 and i couldn\u2019t do that remotely. i felt so useless, which made me feel so depressed and isolated. i think this is when i began to realise this was becoming a problem. i would begin to eat a food item and halfway through i wouldn\u2019t be able to eat it anymore because it made me feel disgusting.\n\nanother incident i would like to bring up is one time in the car when my mum offered me a biscuit, i declined, and she said with the most disgust in her voice, \u2018why are you starving yourself,\u2019 i cried about that like a week later, it hurt that she wasn\u2019t at all understanding, like mental health isn\u2019t something we talk about unless its hers. she proper fishes for sympathy all the time but when i try and help or offer support she shouts at me saying that i wouldn\u2019t understand cause i\u2019m a kid. that kinda sucked.\n\nanother quick incident, last month, for the first time in literally my whole life i wanted to talk about my mental health to my mum, i seriously thought (and still kinda think) i\u2019m depressed, and i want to feel better. so i told her about what i was feeling and my thoughts on the subject, and bitch, let me tell you, the most invalidating thing i have ever experienced was (and still is) being told, \u2018you\u2019re not depressed, its just hormones,\u2019 and yes. this may be true, but you don\u2019t say that, i put myself in a vulnerable position (which was a big arse step) only to get dismissed.\n\nthe unhealthy body image continued till year 10 (age 15, now) in this past month things have gotten worryingly worse, last week i literally went on the biggest food binge ever, i mean PROPER BINGE, everyday for a week i ate until it hurt, physically hurt my stomach. and i think this because i grew 1 inch taller in a week (mad ik) but it made me feel so shitty. not only do i now have big jiggly legs, my stomach isn\u2019t flat anymore, like it isn\u2019t huge but it makes a big difference because i have pretty small hips so i kinda just lost my waistline and i look like a cereal box. it makes me feel so disgusting. most of all i\u2019ve just had a week break for half term, so i\u2019m scares that when i go back people are going to notice that i\u2019ve put on weight.\n\ni think i want to cut down on food, like one meal a day, like i used to, and then slowly cut down more. idk i\u2019m going to see how it goes, because as of now i\u2019m more concerned about my stomach than my legs, but still, i want to lose weight.\n\nthanks for reading this long arse post, i just really need advice, or maybe just someone to say they understand, i just don\u2019t want to feel alone i guess.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

Also, I have a \u201cRapid Transformation Therapy\u201d (RTT) appt scheduled for next month, but it is with a naturopath, not with a licensed psychologist. Has anyone tried RTT? I can\u2019t decide if I should keep the appointment. I haven\u2019t even told my therapist about it yet bc I\u2019m worried about what she will think. She is great and not judgemental but i still have weird reservations about telling her. I just feel so desperate for change right now.\n\nAnyway, my anxieties relating to food and weight are at an all time high. I started smoking again. I can\u2019t look in the mirror. I also think I have a hernia, probably from my weight gain and being inactive. I just feel like an overall train wreck. \n\nI understand that you\u2019re not supposed to let setbacks dictate your life. But I feel like this state of failure is more like my baseline now... does that make sense? \n\nDoes anyone have any actionable things that they use to snap out of this negative mindset? \n\n-Kary", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

That scared the heck out of me so I decided to try and gain with the help of vegan Halloween candy, and to stop weighing myself so I didn\u2019t slip back into restricting. Well, about a week and a half ago I got a migraine and was only eating two slices of toast a day for three days and it triggered that part in me that makes it so incredibly difficult to start eating again.

I decided to step on the scale and it was down 3 lbs from the last day I logged my weight over a month ago! So now ofc I want to weigh myself in the morning to see what it is on an empty stomach.

If I am please let me know and I'll edit again)\n\nRecovery is a *bitch*. \n\nIt's been over a decade since I started restricting calories--first when I was 12-13, but I've had several relapses since then. Right now, I haven't relapsed psychologically; psychologically I'm sick to death of this whole thing. But I'm at a lower weight than I've been since I was in middle school (BMI 15-ish; yes, I'm being monitored by a multitude of doctors). Why? Because I've fucked my health over so badly that my body simply isn't letting me recover.\n\nLooking back at my life, I can trace the health problems anorexia has caused me. Years of anemia and poor blood circulation means I'm always cold and my fingers and toes have gotten frostbite more than once. I have most-likely-permanent chest pain and am at risk for sudden cardiac arrest. I spent almost 3 years with excruciating nerve pain that only just went away last year. I have *literally become less intelligent* from my body starting to eat away at my brain, and my intelligence is one of the things I have always valued the most. I have brain fog, and a great deal of memory loss. I spent a few years sleeping 10-14 hours a day because of intense fatigue. My immune system is shot. I am at a very high risk for osteoporosis; I have developed blood sugar issues that are putting me at risk for diabetes; I have chronically high cholesterol and low blood pressure. \n\nCurrently, I've been dropping weight uncontrollably and have developed gastroparesis. I am trying so hard to gain weight (I need to go from 85 to 120 to be at my previous weight) but I can barely eat because every time I try I'm horribly nauseated or feel full after only a bite or two. Even on a good day I'm only physically able to eat around 900 calories.\n\nI'm just *so angry* about the number of years I've wasted on this disorder, and the fact that the problems don't go away just because you no longer actively want to be sick. I'm angry that I had gotten myself up to a healthy weight and my chronic health issues started to go away, and now that I have lost so much weight they're all starting to come back again. I know that every day I spend at this low weight is pushing me closer to redeveloping these serious health issues. I'm so angry because I want nothing more than to be healthy, and go out on adventures, and not feel sick all the time, and my body is actively preventing me from doing so. I'm angry because being at this low of a weight is shortening my lifespan and reducing my quality of life and I have no control over it. \n\nThat's what eating disorders do in the long term; it may have started out (at least for me) as a means of control but it started controlling me a long time ago. I don't want to act like I know what other people should do with their health, but if you haven't been sick for very long, you *have* to do your best to get off this train as soon as you can. I wish someone had told me that years ago. Romanticizing thinness is cool and all, but the reality of eating disorders is much more deadly than I think a lot of people believe. \n\nIf you read all of this, thanks for listening to this rant! I haven't seen a lot of posts on this subreddit or similar ones that describe where I'm at (most people in recovery are having a lot more trouble with the psychological side of things), and I really needed to get that out.

I don\u2019t eat at work or in the morning, if I do eat it is usually dinner-time and it\u2019s often a sugary dessert like a milkshake. Dairy is really bad for my digestion so I kind of figure if I\u2019m going to do it, might as well have something that I really like and that will evacuate my body as soon as possible. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I only eat a few days a week and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s really because my stomach is upset or because I\u2019m psychologically causing it?\nI know obviously my eating pattern isn\u2019t considered \u201cnormal\u201d, but I\u2019m not sure if it is really ED rooted or just not healthy. I feel like absolute shit after I do eat, but that could just be normal because what I ate was objectively bad for you. I know I didnt always eat this way, and there have been times in my life where I ate at least 2 balanced meals a day, I don\u2019t even know when or why I stopped I guess. I live on my own so no one really notices and I\u2019ve realized I\u2019m more and more avoidant of sit-down meals out or staying over family/friends houses or eating in front of anybody really. My co-workers have occasionally noticed that I don\u2019t take lunch and I just instinctively lie and say I eat a big breakfast each morning. I\u2019ve been trying to analyze my intentions behind this and it is true that I want to maintain a certain physique, but I figure everyone does to some extent. It\u2019s more like I just feel better with an empty stomach. I feel like I\u2019m awake and alert and on top of my shit and my stomach doesn\u2019t feel like it is actively murdering me. I feel like I am making excuses and covering it up because I don\u2019t want anyone to think anything of it and I really really don\u2019t want anyone to intervene in my habits. But I also feel like there isn\u2019t anything wrong with me and I am just trying to prevent people from prying. To me it all feels very private and just thinking about that makes me feel anxious. \nHaving actually written out that last part I do kind of see how this could be disordered eating I guess I haven\u2019t ever lined up my feelings about food before. \nI wouldn\u2019t even know where to begin to undo this??", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

I recovered all by myself and did well for a year, until it came back.Ever since about 3 years ago, I've been at a stable 94-97lbs flux, because I know I have to maintain some degree of health for the work that I do.(My disorder tells me as long as I don't go over 100lbs, I'm ok.)\n\nThe past month or so, I have been slipping more and more and am down to 93lbs, fighting so hard to keep it up a little.The reason for this being is that I am a transgender male(female to male) and I actually had went to the doctor and was on Testosterone for a good 1 1/2 months until I became afraid of all the changes I'd have to make, and the hormones generally weren't working for me like they seemed to for many others, so I stopped.While I was finally on the hormones, the day I got my first shot, I had 0 problems with eating because I knew it would all change soon. But of course, it's a hard path to go down and I don't think I'm strong enough to endure it at the moment. I may try again in the future as gender dysphoria fucks with me every day, hence the eating disorder, among other things as well.\n\nEver since I stopped, I've felt lost and broken, and my calories are usually around 1,000-1,300. At some points only eating 700. My exercise has been increasing, and I haven't been able to sleep, I get bloated more, my heart has been physically hurting again, my bones are horrid, and I'm just so, so tired and depressed, ANGRY all the time, irritable, and sometimes I'll binge, but it's never proper binges. It's just what I consider to be a binge in my personal definition of it. I can never seem to stomach anything over 1,600-1,700 calories in a day. I think this is partially genetic as my whole family is this way.\n\n**I just want to get better.** I really want to just eat normally and be more free about it. I'm tired of thinking about food all the time again. I'm just so scared that if I eat normally, my puberty will continue and I will grow hips and a chest, or that what's already there will get bigger and bigger. My dysphoria gives me nightmares about having a feminine figure, and it's awful. I'm just between a rock and a hard place right now. I don't like being this thin, as I have less muscle mass, but my anorexia tells me it's the only way I'll look male for now, without having to deal with the pain that comes with going through a full transition.Positively, I have been working on getting back into art and photography, and just trying to connect with my environment and the people I love, so as to not think so much about gender, but it comes out continually in my dreams, and this disorder is a way of keeping that anxiety at bay a bit.  \n*I want to find some sort of balance with my body, so that I may have the strength to fight all of these battles, some sort of peace of mind.*  \n\n\nIf there's any words of advice or support, reassurance or love to be shared, I'm all ears.  \nYou all are awesome!", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

But it\u2019s only a matter of time until this feeling creeps up again, and it happens almost daily now. \n\nJust a quick background, I\u2019ve been overweight my whole life, I can remember eating until I couldn\u2019t move as far back as I can remember. Some of my earliest memories are of eating anything and everything until I was sick and just being a conniving little kid that was always trying to sneak food and not get caught. \n\nFour or five years ago I (32/f) was at my heaviest and went through a really bad break up. I guess that give me some motivation to really lock down and try to better myself. I (stupidly) put myself on a 1200 cal diet at my highest weight of 320 pounds and lost 80 pounds in 8 months. I guess it\u2019s safe to say when I fell off that wagon I fell off *hard*. Putting myself on a such a restrictive diet like that intensified the post-diet binge eating more than I could\u2019ve ever imagined. I haven\u2019t been able to get control back since, with the worst of it happening in the past few months. I\u2019ve gained almost 100 pounds in less than a year. \n\nThe binge eating has been different lately though. It keeps me awake at night. The compulsion to stuff sugar and carbs and fat into my body induces a nailbiting, wall punching, teeth grinding level of anxiety that goes straight to my core. When I\u2019m on the verge of a binge, it\u2019s not a matter of if, it\u2019s a matter of when. And the anxiety and the urge doesn\u2019t go away until I just do it, so lately I\u2019ve just been letting it happen, just to make it stop, Because stalling, or trying to reason with myself, or all the other little tips and tricks that I\u2019ve been given by countless therapists over the years just don\u2019t work anymore. \n\nI\u2019ve also noticed in the past few months that I don\u2019t have any kind of perception of what\u2019s actually happening in my stomach, especially during a binge. I dont go from feeling full to being so full I\u2019m in pain. I go from feeling fine one bite and then in agony the next. It\u2019s like my brain just doesn\u2019t register any signals (except pain) for my stomach at all anymore. Ive noticed that this is happening even during regular eating, (granted I know I\u2019m over eating), but it happens even when Im not actively binging. It\u2019s like my stomach and my head are two completely separate entities now. \n\nMy doctor had me on Lexapro for a while because I\u2019ve also struggled with depression, which I\u2019m sure plays a huge factor in the actual binging. I also gained a significant amount of weight while I was taking Lexapro. I stopped taking it for that reason, amongst others. I feel like my head has been fucked up ever since. I\u2019ve also been on Vyvanse for a year or two now, and while I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s helping much, the days where I forget to take it are way way worse than when I do take it. So I guess it\u2019s doing something? \n\nI guess I don\u2019t really know what else to say, maybe I just wanted to complain for a bit. I\u2019m trying to be more open about my struggles, because burying them inside has not worked for me so far. I don\u2019t really know if I\u2019m looking for advice, or maybe there\u2019s someone out there who can relate, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know about anything anymore. All I know is that binge eating is consuming my entire existence and now *not* binging is manifesting as really intense anxiety. I feel like it\u2019s taken on a whole new fa\u00e7ade, one that isnt just a struggle at night now, or a struggle when I am stressed. Its just all the time now. Day in and day out. It\u2019s all I can think about and it\u2019s all I can do to remain somewhat functional in every other aspect of my life. I just really don\u2019t know what to do anymore.

Her doctor stopped seeing her because she refuses to follow the program, lies to seem on track, etc. \n\nMy wedding is in three weeks and she says she just wants to be there and then she will get help.

Her stomach isn\u2019t working, her body functions are slowing down or stopping, and I am so afraid she will either die before, during, or after my wedding. \n\nI am struggling because as much as i want her to be there, I want SO MUCH MORE for her to get help and be healthy. I have been really honest with her about wanting her to go to treatment NOW. Some other friends suggested un-inviting her to my wedding so she understands she needs to get help.\n\nI think if I did that I would try to say as much as I want you there, I would rather have you go get healthy and focus on yourself rather than celebrating me, and my goal is for her to come out of treatment and be able to celebrate with my then husband and I together. So basically make a special event just for her.\n\nMy questions are obviously a lot.\n\n1. Is this a good idea? I would rather have her mad at me than dead.\n\n2. Are there any other tips?

I haven\u2019t been seeing a therapist for the past year though because my therapist I was seeing started to become too expensive. I know it would be beneficial to see a therapist, but I guess I\u2019m feeling really tired of constantly going to appointments and talking about my feelings. But I am still recovery oriented and I have no desire to go back to my eating disorder.\n\nHowever, I feel like I am in a weird place right now. I am a college student and my schedule is pretty intense between school and work and it is so difficult to get all of my meals in as I\u2019d like to. I lost a few pounds after leaving treatment but nothing too crazy, though I am not at the weight that my treatment team set for me. I never actually made it to that weight when in treatment despite being on a high meal plan. So, I just feel weird. I don\u2019t feel like I am engaging in my eating disorder, but I know my meals should be better and I want them to be better. It just feels so hard to consistently accomplish my meal goals with everything else going on in life. Not to mention I am on stimulant meds for ADHD which decrease my appetite, but I don\u2019t feel like that\u2019s really a barrier when it comes to eating. I can eat when I\u2019m not hungry without any issue. \n\nI don\u2019t really want advice on how to meet my meal goals with a busy schedule, I have plenty of advice as far as that goes. Just, has any one else experienced something similar with recovery? I feel like I\u2019m not doing it right because I\u2019m not the weight I should be and I\u2019m not consistently eating every meal. In inpatient, they always said that because we have an eating disorder, it\u2019s not okay for us to miss a meal whereas \u201cnormal\u201d people can miss breakfast and it\u2019s not a big deal. And I\u2019m always questioning myself. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m restricting intentionally\u2026 it feels more situational, but in the back of my head I\u2019m always thinking that I\u2019m doing this wrong and I\u2019m letting the eating disorder win because that is what treatment taught me. I have a positive relationship with food and my body (though I wish I could gain more weight, but having a fast metabolism means eating way more than I have time or money for). I\u2019m the same weight I was pre-eating disorder and I feel like this is exactly how I would be about food if I never had an eating disorder to begin with. But maybe I\u2019m just trying to justify bad behaviors? I don\u2019t know. It was easy to choose recovery because the eating disorder was ruining my life. But now? I don\u2019t feel like I have bad intentions or motivations like I used to. So how do I change? Do I even need to change really? \n\nSorry if this is confusing and kind of a mess.

I'm talking my bowels being so full I couldn't keep food down because they were so distended. But there wasn't a legitimate medical reason for it - I took pro-biotics, forced down mineral oil (fucking disgusting; it's a wonder i didn't starve as a kid because my mom would hide it in my juice, my oatmeal, etc. because I wouldn't take it raw) and went to a bunch of doctors but there was nada.\n\nThat's because I was just holding it in, seemingly for no reason.

I have been a ghost reader for a few months now and am in love with the support and honesty that comes along with this group. Thank you for all of the secondhand love and encouragement. Here we go!\n\nI am a 20 yr F going to school at OSU in Oregon. Junior year is bringing on so many stresses, along with working part-time while going to school. I have had bulimia off and on for the past 5 years and I was hoping that my transition into Junior year would help me stay on track and keep from binging and purging. Sadly, as we all know, bad habits are easy to fall back into and I have relapsed these past 3 weeks. One bad week turned into two, always while I tell myself that Monday will be the day I get on track again. I live in a large party house filled with internationals, so you can imagine how alcohol and social eating can be triggering. I'm a successful student who is now in the Presidents council for OSU and I can't believe I am still fucking struggling with this sick and murderous addiction. Im killing myself, Im ruining my body, my mood, and my mind. My self image is depleting and I just know that if I start my good habits of eating healthy and identifying my stress and triggers then I can move on and begin to heal again. \n\nIt's week 4 of classes and this shit is too hard to pile onto the load I'm already carrying with work, life, and school. \n\nI want to be healthy.\nI want to be honest.\nI dont want to hide food.\nI want to enjoy my meals with my friends. \nI want to work out for health, not for calorie deficit.\nI want to be happy with my health and not jeopardize it with this fucking addiction. \n\nThanks you guys, for listening. I am thinking of reaching out to a nutritionist provided by OSU, they apparently help council ED sufferers. I think keeping up in this chat will further encourage the process. I know I can do it, I know that there is hope. I guess the next post I post will be a progression one. \n\nThis all being said, does anyone have any suggestions for me? Helpful tips? I count my calories and am not actively trying to lose weight. [135, 5 7']. I'm an athlete and weight lift too, so sometimes eating more to sustain my exercise makes me really nervous. I appreciate any and all words regarding this post. \n\nAgain, thank you. I hope to find a community of honest and loving people here who can say \"FUCK EATING DISORDERS!!!!!!\"", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

{"post_id": "dp968u", "created_utc": 1572453131, "title": "Did I find my BED \"cure?\"", "author": "lurklessah", "self_text": "So I joined this group maybe about 2 years ago once I realized that other people binge just like me and I thought it would help me find ways to curb that behavior. The first step is realizing you have a problem right? \n\nI'm no expert in anything at all but I would like to share my experience because maybe it will inspire someone else.\n\nSo my patterns of behavior were that about every 3ish days I would binge. I am overweight and have been my whole life it seems. Often I would eat healthy during the day and then on the way home from work I would pickup my delicious addictions for nighttime merriment. The guilt and shame surrounding food for me was really bad.  \n\nAnyway so a few months ago I am feeling especially strung out from work, I fantasized about living in some remote countryside cabin. But thank the lawd jesus I had told my boss at the beginning of the job I needed time off for a wedding. However once my vacation came I knew 6 days of binge drinking, eating out and partying was just too much for me and I just couldn't do it. So I formed my plot... I told the guilt tripping family and friends that \"sorry I have to work.. I can't make it. I know my boss is sooooo mean booo...\" and I went home and shut off my phone. \n\nBut I needed like a serious high intensity retreat from people.. so I unplugged my internet. What would you do when you have 6 days of no internet, no TV, no phone, and no people to spend time with? \n\nIt was nice at first, I spent that night listening to music, I draw as a hobby so I did that and I went to sleep early. The next day was gloriously sunny so I went for a walk - I brought a book, my journal, a blanket and my wallet. I spent literally 12 hours wandering around my city. When I was tired I found a park and threw down that blanket to watch the clouds, when I was hungry I popped into a store and grabbed an apple and some healthy snacks. Day 1 was nice, but imagine that same lifestyle for 6 days in a row. Weird shit came up...\n\nI wont over type this story but the brief is that I unknowingly put myself into a perfect scenario to sideline all distractions that I use to self soothe and actually had to listen to the voices inside my head. In hindsight I would definitely classify it as mediation and self reflection. I journaled a lot because I had no one to talk to. I walked a lot and I listened to my body and what it needed. I became very aware of my emotions and started to address some baggage I had been avoiding. \n\nSo how does this relate to BED? I really wish I could explain this better but it was like..at some point I could \"hear\" what my body was craving? I understood it better? I don't know exactly but I know that when I started to get hungry I took a long moment to try and understand myself.. like \"okay what do you want to eat?\" and then there was a very quiet subtle voice saying: \"something .. salty? You need salt. But also something refreshing because it's hot and you're dehydrated. Also, we could use some easy sugars because you're burning a lot of calories with these unexpected walks.\" \n\nHmmm.. I could go for a lb of salty popcorn and a soda? Salt, Water and sugar! \n\n\"Nooo! How am I supposed to process that? Your gut will be laid out for hours trying to digest that corn and your heart rate will jump with all that sugar, it will be a shit show in here! Cant you make it something easy?\"\n\nI ended up eating fresh tomato slices with salt and pepper sprinkled on them, and a fresh fruit juice. And I felt perfect afterwards. This \"food enlightenment\" happened for me around day 3. The rest of the weekend went the same and by the time I went back to work I had actually lost enough weight (albeit it was probably a lot of bloating) that my coworkers noticed. \n\nI thought I would immediately go back to my old routine but the crazy part was that I didn't. I have days where I definitely think like \"yeah I want a burger, fries and a shake and my body can suck it.\" But the bottomless void of binge almost completely stopped. It sounds ludicrous but now when I get that gross delicious food - I almost never finish it. And not because I'm trying to be good, I'm not trying at all. It's like I can finally hear the signals of \"okay.. you've had your fun with this food, but that's enough now and you won't be getting anymore pleasure from this meal after this bite.\" \n\nIt's been months of no binge eating. I don't miss it and I don't even think about it. Only when I see posts from BED do I remember that I used to binge 3 times a week for over 10 years. After that weekend I realized how much impact it had, I have scheduled more personal weekends because of it and I have been more actively self reflecting through either journaling or meditating. My weight has been slowly and steadily dropping but more importantly I feel more at peace with my body - we're friends again haha. \n\nTL;DR - I went radio silent for 6 days without internet, TV or phone and experienced food enlightenment and other positive shit. It kick started a new lifestyle in which I meditate, feel great and don't binge.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

Within the passed 4 months I got pretty bad with restricting and was getting control of the binges so I was dropping weight like nothing. I just moved to go to college and I decided that this move would be my time to get better, to work on myself and recover from not only disordered eating but from SH as well. At the start of the year I was living with an old man and a younger man, then I made the mistake of offering to talk to my landlord for a classmate who wanted to leave the place she was staying. \n\nI was in the midst of \u2018recovery\u2019 in a way, getting there anyways, before she moved in. I\u2019m a broke college student so I\u2019m basically living off ichiban noodles and Diet Coke, before she moved in I was putting veggies and chicken in a package for dinner and I\u2019d have some other small snacks during the day which felt like I was getting somewhere. Some days I\u2019d even bring myself to have two packages over the day, but now that she\u2019s moved in and made a comment to me when I was having a second package I won\u2019t eat them anymore.\n\nWhen she first moved in we were alright, I shared a bit with her while I was drunk. I told her about the way I eat and shared about my scars (since I\u2019d like to be able to go through my evenings in shorts without having to worry). She seemed really supportive since I was saying I really wanted to get better and into a healthier state. We were all good for a couple of weeks and then she started making comments to me, I\u2019m sure they were unintentional but damn... \u201cYou eat a lot\u201d, \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten properly in like three days\u201d, \u201cYou don\u2019t need that\u201d, \u201chaha if I lose more than three pounds it\u2019s scary\u201d, her saying just small things like that just got to me, like she\u2019s naturally very thin and has some health issues so I already get quite jealous. For some reason just having someone much smaller than you say things like that is hard. I\u2019ve gone from doing alright, most days I wasn\u2019t counting calories, no laxatives, I wasn\u2019t even weighing in for the most part and now I\u2019m fasting, counting calories, back to weighing in twice a day, ExLax is my best fuckin friend...etc.\n\nI know everything she\u2019s doing isn\u2019t intentional but it just sucks. She changed from someone I felt I could get close to and feel comfortable with but now she doesn\u2019t even bother listening to me when I talk and only has me around to listen to all of her issues and rant about her boyfriend with. Feels like with her around I\u2019m not gonna get anywhere near recovery anymore. I know I should take responsibility for this but I can\u2019t help but resent her a bit, I\u2019m just back in the same place as I was in high school.\n\n\nPs.

I know it\u2019s not even that many calories because I don\u2019t get it sweetened but the only way I can have it is if I calculate it at 400 calories.

{"post_id": "dpexjs", "created_utc": 1572478378, "title": "What I learned in Overeaters Anonymous/Eating Disorder Therapy", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "Hi everyone, I thought I'd start a running thread in which I document the main takeaways from my eating diorder therapy (after all these years, finally managed to find a specialist -- a psychology PhD who also teaches at an accredited medical school in the United States -- who treats binge eating!!! -- \\*\\*\\*disclaimer: this does not constitute formal medical advice and I am not a doctor or clinician of any kind\\*\\*\\*) because I know not everyone has access to such an amazing resource.  In sessions we do (homework-based) CBT, so there are tons of things I learn each week that others here would theoretically be able to implement.  Once I get home and have a minute I'm going to type up my notes from each session to date, and plan to update my post with new teachings and learnigns each time I go.\n\nUser u/kintyre is learning useful things in Overeaters Anonymous, so I've invited them to post here as well!\n\nAlso please feel more than free to contribute in the comments if you're in some sort of group program or treatment in which you're learning something that you'd like to share with others.  Once we hit a critical mass, maybe we can figure out how to capture our learnings in a more permanent format?\n\n**Week 1,** BED therapy: First session, we discuss my relationship with food, the reasons I think I binge, my parents' attitudes toward food, the fact that I started bingeing as a kid, mental health history, relationships and things that I believe are causing me to binge. I document my relationship history, and note that a few of those relationships were abusive. SO therapeutic -- I've never ever spoken about my eating issues with another person like this, and particularly not with a fit woman like my therapist (talking about and eating food with/in front of other women who are thin/fit is a major trigger of mine).\n\nThe overarching goal of this therapy is trying to decouple food from emotions, because I use food as a tool (to cope with ADHD-related boredom, depression, and anxiety).  To combat this, I'm supposed to try to do things that encourage me to view eating as a thing that I just do on a schedule. Specifically, I'm told to eat 3x a day, with 2 snacks.  I can eat basically whatever I want, within reason.  Given my work schedule, we decide to schedule breakfast for 9 am, lunch for 12 pm, and dinner for 7 pm.  I decide to eat a snack around 3:30, and one after dinner and before bed around 9 pm.  I've tried intermittent fasting with some degree of success, but she doesn't want me doing intermittent fasting for now.\n\nI'm also told to download an (free) app called Recovery Record (seems to be favored by clinicians).  Im supposed to record EVERYTHING that goes into my mouth, including drinks, by taking a picture.  With each meal, I record my feelings, how much I ate (too little/too much/just right), my satiety before and after.  Unplanned or binge meals are recorded as such.\n\nEven though I really want to lose weight, I am told NOT to weigh myself, \"diet,\" count calories or weigh/measure anything, or restrict in any way.  I'm not to use coffee or tea as an appetite suppressant. (Some of) these are things that we will start doing later in my recovery, as my eating starts to stabilize. I'm supposed to be eating in accordance with my intuition and at the prescribed times. Anything I want -- there are no good foods and no bad foods, and we discuss how I should stop referring to them as such.\n\nSo over this week, I started recording everything including my binges -- oddly, this seems to have a therapeutic effect (even though the thought of it gave me enormous anxiety). Just seems to decrease my binges the first week.\n\n**Week Two:** My binge episodes are greatly reduced, in just one week of therapy.  Documenting everything I'm eating + journaling my feelings on the app is helping me immensely.  We talk about the importance of ignoring the voices in your head that tell you to eat, and reflect on how we are not (necessarily) a slave to our impulses.  I worry about all the takeout/fast food I'm eating, but therapist reminds me that there are no bad foods and we are focused on regularizing my eating before we take any additional steps to actually change what I'm eating.  We don't weigh this week; I'm reminded that our goal is not weight loss at this stage, but rather to resist binge eating.\n\nSome skills we start working on in week two: -Eating MINDFULLY-- put away the computer, phone, reading material.  Focus on tasting the food, textures, and genereally being aware of what I'm eating.  -Grounding myself when I feel an urge to binge coming on. This can take the form of counting to ten silently and letting the urge to binge wash over me;  count ten things in the room or space around you; wiggling toes and feet and fingers for twenty seconds. -- Recognize your triggers.  For me this week I realize it's several things: Interacting with an abusive family member who is majorly into food restriction and shames me about my weight;  trying on clothes taht don't fit; keeping trigger foods (ice cream, chocolate) in my house; looking into a mirror in which I don't look good; thinking that people are noticing my weight gain; spending too much time on the computer; social isolation (I am a major extrovert, but I live alone, am single, and work remotely which makes for a lot of alone time).\n\nWe note this session that I'm struggling with eating at the prescribed times. I recommit to eating 3x a day with two snacks no matter how I'm feeling.  I ask whether I am allowed to skip breakfast if I have a nighttime binge, and therapist says no -- I'm to stick to the 3x, 2 snacks structure at all times and not restrict to compensate.\n\nI'm also to rid the house of any triggers.  These include my trigger foods (for me any sweets, carbs, pizza, chips etc.), my scale (a trigger for me personally -- off to storage it goes), clothes that no longer fit, pictures from a much fatter or much skinnier time that make me upset, hurtful emails froman old friend, and similar. I'm also told to ONLY buy the food that I need for myself, and to get rid of any food that exceeds what I actually need (we acknowledge that this is potentially wasteful).\n\nI'm encouraged to pick a physical activitiy I enjoy and try to do it for 10 minutes a day.  I am not to do this to compensate for overeating or a binge, however.  This activity should be independent of my eating. I also realize that I have a HUGE problem with Ubereats/delivery, so I block all delivery sites that I can think of on my cell phone using a blocker app (Android).", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

My ED cycles depending on what\u2019s going on, purging, restricting, normal eating, over exercising etc. currently I would say I\u2019m more so in a restrictive phase. Throughout my years my weight has been under, average, and high average. I typically fall at the low average/just under area- where I currently am.\n\nI\u2019m having a VERY hard time in recovery, I\u2019m truly really half assing, if that, it at the moment. I always convince myself I\u2019m not sick enough even though, through the little testing I\u2019ve done, I have a heart problem and unstable vitals. My ED just makes me think, and always has made me think, since I\u2019m not SIGNIFICANTLY underweight that I\u2019m not sick and that nothing bad can happen to me.\n\nThe stories that get me the most are those who are average weight and end up dropping dead or close to it from complications. I just read something online about a girl who died from taking apple cider vinegar pills and she wasn\u2019t like \u201cshockingly\u201d thin.

About a month ago, I was prescribed Topamax starting at 25mg and I\u2019m now up to 100mg. Let me start by stating my experience prior to taking the drug: pure fear. I looked it up online and the side effects scared the fuck out of me. Before I got it, I was contemplating not taking it for quite a while. The side effects I saw online looked brutal. A lot of people call it the devil and dopamax. \n\nNow onto my experience. Keep in mind, medication is extremely personal and affects everyone differently. For me though, around the 9th day on 50mg I successfully had my first binge free day in over 2 years. It sounds crazy but it got bad for a while. Since then I have yet to binge again which is pretty insane. I still have a lot of anxiety surrounding a relapse but given my lack of an appetite, paired with less impulsive behaviors, it has become much less of an option. \n\nIt\u2019s by no means a miracle. You get face tingles that are pretty intense. The worst side effect is probably that I think I\u2019ve had some hair loss going on. Psych said that could be because I\u2019m in deep calorie deficit (I\u2019m down 12 pounds). Sometimes you feel kinda dizzy and uncomfortable. It\u2019s weird. Still though, I\u2019d take these any day over binging.\n\nThe point of this post isn\u2019t to praise topamax, it\u2019s to encourage y\u2019all to reach out for professional help (medication and CBT) if you have not done so yet. I feel free for the first time in a long time and it would bring me joy if anybody else who\u2019s struggling gets to feel that as well. This disorder sucks because, unlike other drugs, you\u2019ll always have to eat. You can never quit.

I am a male, so it's a bit difficult to navigate at times, given a lot of the advice / features / articles / podcasts / books are largely focused at women.\nI was able to overcome my anorexia around the age of 25, but unfortunately, this morphed instead into exercise addiction.  I find myself increasing my activity day over day, and 'setting a new bar' that I have to continue to meet or exceed to 'earn' food.  I'm in a vicious cycle.\nI was wondering if anyone has a suggestion on books / articles / podcasts / otherwise that I could read to learn strategies to get out of this cycle.  I'd love to just have a 'normal' day, where I could rest, relax, and not feel like because I'm resting I cannot eat for the day.\nAppreciate any help.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

I would binge anything in the fridge at night (frozen bread, pepsi, chocolate, chips, ice cream, chicken broth, cheese, tortillas, 1kg of grapes)  and while I had a therapist. I didn't know I had bad eating habits. My family wouldn't know that either, because I was 'skinny' they said.\n\nNow 3 years later, we moved and while I do still have the problem of eating 2 80g boxes of chocolate w/almonds out of habit (I used to eat 6 everyday). It is my only trigger food now, I started drinking only water and as I changed therapist, I got self-aware about my unhealthy coping mechanisms and with the help of my father who is kinda abusive but did make his best to let me buy healthier foods. I eat strawberries and peachs now. And next I'm trying to slowly eliminate the chocolate boxes to two per week. I'm very proud of myself!

Long story short: I'm 1 month into giving up 1.5 year long \"dieting\" aka staying in a calorie deficit range to lose and maintain afterwards. I've been so obsessed with it as I've reached the weight I didn't even \"dream\" of. I used to count every single bite of food / ingredient when cooking and wrote down all the consumed calories every single day. Then I realized I didn't eat fats at all and started incorporating them into my diet and counting them as well which has made me even more confused and I decided to give up.  \n\n\nSo this entire month I'm still struggling with counting everything I ate in my head, and worrying about weight gain yet trying my best not to measure my body or stand up on the scales. I lost all the hunger cues by the time I gave up \"dieting\" (as I tried to eat my breakfast late and dinner early at certain times, which made me thinking about food all the time). And now even though I don't really feel physical hunger, whenever I start eating I can't stop, I just eat whatever I can get my hands on until I'm stuffed. Also I've never restricted certain foods while restricting calories, but right now I eat a lot of chocolate/candy/cookies n etc. Even though I don't crave them, I just see it and eat.\n\nSo I'm really worried if this phase is going to pass sooner or later? As I'm scared of getting most of my calories from those kinda foods. I'm not really scared of gaining weight, even though I was never underweight.

Flaming red head-to-toe rash and the most horrifically dry skin. I was basically bedridden. Exhausted, grumpy, in agony, freezing all the time. My doctor believed how terrible I felt and tested me for a bunch of autoimmune diseases and other things but couldn\u2019t find anything. \n\nI was barely eating (had an ED a few years ago, but I was probably still only consuming 1000 cal on average per day). Started eating a bunch more after figuring why not, it couldn\u2019t hurt. \n\nOh my god guys. My eczema is still there but it\u2019s so so much better and my skin feels semi-*normal* again. I can actually get through the day. About a week after refeeding I realised my feet weren\u2019t so cold at night anymore. I\u2019m warmer in general. I have *energy*. It\u2019s so amazing. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this?", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

If I can\u2019t take care of myself mentally or physically enough to keep a weight that is 95lbs or more I will tell my psychiatrist. I will eat healthy and give myself enough energy to function and live my life.\n\nI will not ruin my health, life, or relationships over my warped body image and self loathing.

Daily I eat between one and two meals. I'm at university and when I'm there, I struggle to eat.

When places don't have the nutritional info, I can't handle it. My doctor advised me to lose weight but I'm struggling bc calorie counting fuels my ed and I become obsessed with it and won't eat if I can't count the calories effectively. I even panic when I try to record my juice intake like how to am I supposed to know how much I drunk today? My head is swirling and i just can't.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}
