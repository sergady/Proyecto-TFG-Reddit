On and off and over again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I *know* I need to treat this like the addiction it is. That means **I need to just accept that I will not consume that substance again, ever.** Not a bite here and there, not a cheat meal every once in a while, nothing. I get that these foods are triggers and that they lead me down a path of self destruction every time. It's like how an alcoholic needs to accept that they can not have a beer or glass of wine, even after years of recovery. It's just how it is, and I'm starting to see that this is the only way out of this vicious cycle I find myself in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**But then, I feel like it's not a realistic approach.** My mind reacts with \"oh really? So you're telling me you're never ever having a french fry again? Not one slice of pizza, not one burger, ever? You're never having bread or pastries or pasta or rice? You're never ever going to have cake or cookies or muffins or chocolate bars? **Ever**? What about special occasions? What about vacations? What if you go to Italy?

Ive been diagnosed with a binge eating disorder characterized by cycles of restriction and bingeing. I\u2019ve been very successful in recovery so far working on eating more protein (most of us with BED are severely protein deficient) and learning that I\u2019m insulin resistant which has been one of the the caused of my insatiable appetite. Unfortunately this month I hit a wall in recovery. I was just diagnosed with ADD and prescribed vyvanse which has been life changing in terms of what it has done for my focus, motivation, etc. One of the side effects of vyvanse is a suppressed appetite. I think my doctor assumed the suppressed appetite would be a good thing for someone with BED because it would decrease the likelihood of binges. Unfortunately the decrease in appetite has given strength to my eating disorder voice. The biggest problem is that I can\u2019t convince myself to eat when I don\u2019t have an appetite. And as most of us with BED know; when we restrict, we binge, and when we binge we restrict. I\u2019m scared that all the work I\u2019ve been doing this year to eat more regularly and give my body the nutrition it needs is flying out the window. BUT I don\u2019t want to go off ADD medication. It has been incredibly life changing and has made me feel more like myself then I have in years. So: Has anyone else had this experience? Are there ADD medications that are safer for my eating disorder? Any tips for people with both of these diagnoses? Any tricks to eating while on vyvanse or eating without an appetite?

I'm writing this on my phone, in the middle of a  New Year's party, and my thoughts are everywhere. \n\nMy GF has an ED. We've been a thing for about 2 months now, just  started really opening up to each other, but I've known that she has  weird dietary habits before being with her. I love her with all my heart  and soul, and it kills me hearing her talk about stuff I don't  understand/can't help with. I, myself, have depression, anxiety, and  bipolar disorder. I know how it feels to talk to someone and have them  not understand. It's already awkward enough between her and I as she's  the first person I trust and love, this is all very new to me. She also  lives in another city, which makes it all harder knowing that I can't  physically be there for her when she needs someone to hug. It fucking  tears me apart and I know how it feels. \n\nWhat's hurting me the most is that I don't know what to tell her.  I've never had friends/knew anyone who suffered from an eating disorder.  Like for example, she goes for like a couple days without eating  anything, just water. I know this is wrong, but I can't tell her to just  eat, it feels like my parents not understanding depression telling me  to \"just smile and think positive thoughts\". I hate it. \n\nA running gag between us to ask each other about what we're  eating/planning to eat. She's skinny, not super duper skinny, just  skinny. She says that she's gonna \"eat a lot today\" which usually ends  up being a hundred something calories. Most of the time she ends up not  eating that due to any reason, food seems to be a secondary thought of  hers. If she's stressed about something, thinking about something, or  just doing anything really, she doesn't eat. \n\nHer habits include going on a mono diet, fasting, eating tiny bits of food, and some I can't remember rn. \n\nWe talked a bit about what she thinks might be causing these odd  dietary habits. She said \"self loathing, self hate, wanting to die, and  proving my dad wrong for something he said to be 12 years ago\" She also  added \"this is a great way to get this feeling without killing myself.  Gotta graduate college before that. It'll make mom less sad\"\n\nShe has family issues. Her dad is an abusive cunt, but thankfully  he's not in the picture anymore. Sometime around the age of 12 or 11 she  found a forum that had a lot of girls who had various kinds of EDs. She  befriended some and started doing what they did. She just \"felt good\"  after each destructive thing she did. She felt like \"she's in control\".  She can't go to a therapist, her mom thinks it's a \"trendy diet thing\"  although her daughter is clearly not ok. She hides her sad thoughts and  disorder from her family because it will cause more problems and make  her mom worry. \n\nSorry for the wall of text. I'm just all over the place.

No gagging noises, no redness, a whole meal comes out within seconds. I've even came up with ways to get rid of the sound of vomit hitting the toilet water. You wouldn't be able to tell even if you had your ear to the toilet door and were trying to figure out whether someone is throwing up in there or not.\n\nA couple of weeks ago I went out to McDonald's to eat with my family. I had a 1500 calorie binge, went to the bathroom, hands-free blasted everything out in 30 seconds, came back to where we were sitting a minute later like nothing happened. No puffiness, redness or wet eyes. Almost immediately after I had sat down my mom pointed out that I had a tiny stain of Big Mac sauce on my right index finger and handed me a tissue to wipe it off.\n\nI had no idea that the minuscule skin-colored stain was even there myself, but then someone else immediately notices it after I had returned from the bathroom after a big meal? The only explanation I can think of is that she was looking at my fingers on purpose to see if they were irritated and red, because that's what usually happens when you use the gag reflex to purge. That explanation is even more probable because she herself struggled with bulimia for a couple of years back in the day. Then her child lost a lot of weight, is underweight, but is eating a ton of food without gaining weight. Any person capable of basic logic would connect the dots from personal experience alone. The speed and lack of redness unfortunately outsmarted her again.\n\nIt feels so criminal and wrong, but yet so thrilling to be fooling everyone daily. The average person has absolutely no clue that it's even possible to throw up without sticking things down your throat, but here I am using that as a tool to maintain the illusion of normalcy.

I was doing a lot better a couple years back but I've been steadily getting worse with things this past year. I now have one friend I talk to about it (she figured me out earlier this year bc she's dealt with this shit too) and I started seeing a therapist weekly a couple months ago.\n\nAround that time is also when I started getting worse again. I had just finished a big race I had trained for, weather started getting shitty &amp; I wasn't running as much &amp; I had more work to do, &amp; I felt run down and exhausted in general. Theres too many social events around food and I've been purging a lot more frequently since then, at lowest once a week. The past two weeks have gotten worse, approaching once a day.\n\nObviously I know what I'm doing is stupid and unhealthy and not sustainable and the whole nine yards. I just can't deal with the few pounds Ive gained recently (*only* like 5 but still) and all the unhealthy shit I've been eating or has been available at holiday parties, outings with friends...ect. I don't want to live like this, I don't want to get bad and have this shit continue to run my life but I just can't bring myself to care enough when I want to purge.\n\nI can tell myself I'm not doing bad bc I'm not underweight/have blatantly obvious health consequences and am (otherwise from ED shit) a reasonably well-functioning adult lol. I'm a grad student and doing well in my program, have lots of friends &amp; a good social life. I know I can't keep doing this without consequences. But when I want to purge its so easy to give in. I just lose the ability to care, I want to get what I ate out and am so scared of gaining/not losing weight that nothing else matters that moment.

I'm a logical person and know how illogical what I'm doing is. I know its not worth it. I know this is dangerous and stupid and can ruin my life. Overall, I really do care and want to get better.

In the past couple weeks I've fucking ran off from my friends and puked in a restaurant bathroom, went to a park bathroom close to my house to purge Xmas dinner, and more. Its just so overwhelming. Obviously I'm gonna keep going to therapy and know its a process and gonna take months and years of work but I don't know what else I can do. Did any of y'all have a come to jesus moment or something that actually spurred you to actually start getting better? To start caring when it mattered?

Reality becomes \"tunneled\" during a binge (aka tunnel vision, or fixation). It's like the only thoughts that exist are those that don't want you to eat, and those that want you to eat really bad. It's like all of life's other thoughts, issues, desires, beauty, etc go away and you can't think of anything else. It's important to stay aware of the rest of the world. It's important to know that there are other things that you can do other than eat.\n2. There is a logical (but faulty) reason for binging. My brain has a deep desire for emotional fullness - it is lacking in certain emotional needs - for me it's usually because I'm bored and, in more drastic cases, the world has no meaning. So in response, to make me feel full and satisfied, my brain opts for the \"shortcut\": eating. Emotional satisfaction is much harder to obtain and takes much longer; eating is an immediate satisfaction and very easy to get these days. So technically, our brain's reaction center is working just fine... it's just that our long-term brain isn't. lol.\n3. It's good to have food restrictions on \"involuntary foods\". I classify voluntary foods as foods that your body naturally desires out of hunger and nutrition. On the other hand, involuntary foods are basically the foods that you have no control over &amp; eat when not hungry... and are generally very unhealthy too.\n4. Consistency is key to weight loss!! Yes, fasting will help you lose weight. But after fasting, how many days do you use to bounce back from a fast? And don't you use the next day to eat more? And yes, eating perfect is good for weight loss, how many times have you told yourself \"if only I could not eat X then I could lose weight\" and what are your results from it? Probably no results. Weight loss is NOT A GOAL - it is a mental exercise that you will be doing forever (but it gets easier once you get the hang of it). Does it make any sense to go to the gym only until you reach your goal weight, and then you stop? No. You keep exercising for the reasons why you wanted to lose weight in the first place - health, endurance, identity, etc, and most of all - keep your progress. Same as weight loss - you should not be looking at the fastest way to lose weight, you should be looking at the best &amp; most stable weight loss. Stop those drastic multiple-day fasts and other extreme diets, they never work long-term. Plus, to be honest, consistency makes you much more happier and satisfied about your eating habits than a fast.\n5. Take it slow &amp; gentle. Don't eat anything to upset your stomach. Keep bloating down. Get used to the feeling of a not-angry stomach, so you know where your goal 'stomach feeling' is.\n\nThings I still don't know how to solve\n\n1. When food is right in front of you, and you can't leave, how do you resist? I keep smelling and looking at the food and the anticipation of the food keeps building up until I (almost always) give in &amp; eat it/ binge on it. I become so fixated on the food and it feels like I'm just delaying the process of eating until I will eventually get it. If I try to distract myself from eating it, I start to believe that I am only postponing the inevitable (eating) - I never actually believe that distracting will make me stop eating/binging some food completely. Sometimes, reasoning works, but not a lot.\n2. How do you get out of the \"I need to eat\" mentality? I have so many reasons why I need to eat - the habit of finishing everything on my plate, to not become malnourished (as if!), to not waste food, to have good concentration, etc. Somehow, these outweigh the reasons to not eat.

I'm 5'6\" and my pre-ED weight was 113 lbs. I've always been very underweight as a child, and 113 lbs was the only time I was no longer \"extremely underweight\", only underweight. I hadn't weighed myself in a while, so seeing 113 when I was used to &lt; 100 triggered my ED. I was 103 lbs at my lowest with a net of 500-1000 cals a day, and though I had many physical symptoms (lost period, hair falling out, brain fog, fatigue) I only lost 10 lbs. \n\nAt around the 1.5 month mark into my ED, I decided to start eating \"normally\", but I wasn't fully committed to recovery. After gaining up to 125 or so, I got too scared and went back to restricting. This happened maybe once or twice more, and I began running 3-5 miles a day as well. \n\n3 months ago I finally committed to recovery, and my weight gain was quick. I'm now at 145-150 lbs, meaning I've overshot by 30+ lbs. Even if I factor in small gain / growth, this still means massive overshoot. I've gained over 3 times what I lost, and I'm feeling insanely uncomfortable in my own skin. I look like a completely different person and everyone is commenting on my weight gain. My extreme hunger has tapered, although I'm still eating maybe 3000 calories a day now. My appetite is therefore still elevated and my weight is still increasing. I've gone up literally 10 freaking pant sizes in 3 months (from 5 to 15) and I'm so scared not knowing when it will stop. \n\nI've gone from underweight to overweight even though I've been underweight my entire life, and I'm terrified. Is it normal to have such a large overshoot? I've read most people only overshoot by up to 10 pounds, and their starting weight was higher than mine. I'm trying to be body-positive, but it's so difficult when I've gained so much already with no signs of stopping. Am I doing something wrong? When can I expect my weight gain to stop, and will my overshoot ever taper? I feel like I've wasted my life. Sorry this was so long.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

Because of these improvements, I know that recovery is worth it.\n\nBut despite all of these things, I am still not content and ready to let go of the idea of my eating disorder. I was looking through pictures of me during recovery and I can't really detect any visible change from my initial overshoot weight gain to now.

My face is still rounder than before my ED and my body, while it does not feel as puffy, looks still the same. \n\nI'm frustrated at how my body is stagnant at its overshoot weight. I've followed the recovery protocol: rest, eat, repeat. While other people's weights seem to come down and redistribute around this time or in a few month - I just feel like it isn't happening for me and isn't going to happen to me. I just feel so hopeless. I'm tired of thinking of my eating disorder, but my body feels like the only thing holding me back.

Absolutely No Appetite", "author": "EDPostRequests", "self_text": "Hey all,\n\nFor reference, I\u2019m a 20 year old female.\n\nSo, about a month ago, my boyfriend broke up with me. It was a pretty rough breakup (after 3 years, no warning signs, on our anniversary, over text), and since then my ed has resurfaced with a vengeance. I hadn\u2019t necessarily \u201crecovered\u201d, but I was close. Anorexia had become more of a mild annoyance than the life-consuming ordeal it had been a few years prior. I won\u2019t lie, my relationship - and specifically my partner - played a big role in those steps towards recovery. I gained a bit of weight (and wasn\u2019t thrilled), but I don\u2019t think I realized quite how much this relationship kept me grounded with my mentality until now.\n\nSince then, I have absolutely no appetite. I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s the heartbreak, or the ed, but I think it must be some combination of the two. It\u2019s been weeks now. Everything makes me nauseated to even look at or smell, to the point I need to leave the room. During previous relapses, not eating was still a struggle. I still wanted food, but denied it. Now I can\u2019t stand anything, and I\u2019ve lost 15 pounds in four weeks, and have dropped into the \"Underwieht. It\u2019s not my lowest, but it\u2019s still much lower than I\u2019ve been in a while.\n\nI guess I just don\u2019t know what to do. Before, at least I could stand the sight of food. But now I don\u2019t even know how to get my stomach onboard with my mind. I\u2019m at the point where I want to eat, but just can\u2019t.\n\nIf anyone has any advice, or has been through something similar, I\u2019d love any tips. Or even anything to increase appetite.

I used it religiously for half a year and became borderline underweight. For those of you who don't know, myfitnesspal is an app designed to calculate the calories intake of your food as well as set different goals for the different macronutrients you get from food including protein, fat, carbs, sugar, fibre and even the vitamins. calorie goals are set for you to meet every day based on your height, weight and weight loss goals. \n\nI have never been overweight, I have always been aware of that. But since I became a teenager, I had become curvy and carried some weight. I always received compliments from my friends. In fact, I was known for having really nice curves. Even so, I always have felt self-conscious and have been trying to lose weight somehow. I don't know where this self-consciousness comes from but it has always been there. Anyway, I had tried different ways of losing weight but none really worked. It was one night when I had been staying up late on my phone (I also struggle with insomnia but that is a different issue) when I stumbled across on a youtube video of a professional ballerina who uses a food diary to calculate her calories. Upon reading the comments, I had found several recommendations to use myfitnesspal as it was a much more convenient way to count your calories and had resulted in successful weight loss. \n\nI found a sudden surge of motivation to take this diet seriously and I promised to myself I wouldn't become a yo-yo dieter and stay committed. That I can say I certainly did. Perhaps I should've known that this wasn't a good idea since I have the tendency to become obsessed with something to the point where it becomes the prime focus of my life. Then I downloaded the app and began my diet. \n\nIn the first few weeks, I can say that I wasn't obsessive. I ate as I normally would, only estimating the portion sizes of my food and learning how to use the app. To my surprise, I wasn't too hungry either. I was enjoying using the app as I saw it as a way to learn how to eat healthily and control my appetite. It was then when I started to lose weight. It happened very rapidly and my parents could notice it straight away. Receiving compliments, I had found a new appreciation for my body. For the first time in years, I actually felt comfortable in my skin; I loved the way I looked and began to feel addicted to weight loss. \n\nMore and more of my spare time became dedicated to my new diet and I spent hours researching recipes and reading articles on the app itself. One article, in particular, stood out saying that you should weigh your food in order to reach an accurate estimate of your caloric intake. Another article warned against eating food and then not logging it into the app as it would hinder your weight loss. I took all this very seriously and stepped up the dieting a notch. Now every single thing I ate whether it was strawberries or pasta, I weighed using measuring scales. I would always cook my own food and prepare my school lunch by myself. at school, everyone complimented me on how healthy my lunch looked or how much they wished they could be as dedicated to their diet as me. no one saw it as dangerous. whenever I was offered any food, whether it was from my friends or family, I would always refuse it. I thought that if I didn't completely stick to my diet it would be a failure. I never went over my calorie goal or my macronutrient goals for any day. \n\nAs I carried on losing weight I also received different sorts of comments. I went on holiday to my home country in the summer where I met all my family that didn't live in England, where I currently live. Having not seen me for a year, the weight loss was much more apparent. They would compliment me but then also add at the end that they thought I had lost too much weight. I completely dismissed this as I thought their idea of what was underweight was outdated. I thought they were refusing to be happy for my accomplishment as they didn't realise how much dedication I had put into looking the way I did. Retrospectively, I know they were only speaking the truth: I had lost too much weight. \n\nMeanwhile, I had also noticed that I had been missing my period for a long time. Actually, I had stopped getting my period the moment I began my diet. And to be honest, it didn't concern me. As long as I was losing weight, it didn't matter to me. Every time I wasn't eating, I was obsessively thinking about what I would eat next. I would fall asleep fantasising about breakfast, and wake up ravenous. A lot of times my mum would ask me if I was hungry but I always said I wasn't, even if I was. I had begun to also exercise at every opportunity because then I could add on the calories the app and be able to eat more. I told myself it was so that i could lose more weight but I knew deep down it wasn't true. \n\nEventually, I came to the realisation that I had lost enough weight so I changed the settings of the app so that I would maintain my weight. I thought that this would resolve my issues, that I wouldn't be hungry anymore, yet I was. I still felt that same hunger in my stomach all the time and wished I could eat whatever I wanted. but I was afraid I would gain weight. it was my biggest fear. I was beginning to accept that I had to change something. I spoke to my mum and asked her if she thinks I should stop using the app since its making me unhappy and stressing me out. she told me that I should because she knows people who have lost huge amounts of weight and then gained it all back, sometimes even more than before. She was worried the same thing would happen to me. So I listened to her. I continued using the app. \n\nSometime later, I went on an expedition with my school where I had to walk about thirty km over the course of two days while carrying a backpack that was extremely heavy. Being at the weight I was, this was too much physical exertion for my body to handle. I began throwing up and became faint on many occasions as i refused to eat anything even remotely sugary. I struggled to have the strength needed to carry on. At one point, my friend had to carry my bag for me so that i could get a break. at night I had a long conversation with myself where I promised myself that i would change something. It was something of a revelation. \n\nWhen I arrived home I told my mum that I would stop using the app completely and go back to my normal way of eating. I also told her that I had been missing my periods and we rung up the doctor the next day. The doctor had told me that i was borderline underweight and needed to gain some weight. So I did. I deleted the app. I ate as much as I could every day and ensured that I satisfied my appetite all the time. I felt guilty about it though because it was so easy for me to eat so much. i felt like a failure because i had managed to abandon my diet so easily. I felt like I was eating so much and without even being able to taste the food. perhaps I wasn't eating that much food but I was just used to eating much less. \n\nI was called back to the doctor about a month later to be weighed. The nurse had weighed me and told me I had gained weight and was now at a healthy weight. She thought that because my weight had changed so much in about a month that my weighing scales must have been broken or something when I had weighed my self previously. However, I ensured that I had just put on weight. I didn't tell her that I had been on a calorie restrictive diet though. on the way home I cried in the car and my mum asked me why. It was because I had gained weight. She assured me that i could always lose a few kgs if I wanted to since my weight was a little past the limit of being \"healthy\". \n\nNow it has been several months since I have returned to normal eating and I now face new challenges. I absolutely hate the way I look even though i know it is necessary for me to be at this weight. I feel like a failure because I became the very thing I despised: a yo-yo dieter. I lost weight then gained it all back. I avoid looking at myself naked and sometimes cry if I do. I know I am not fat but I still feel fat. \n\nI apologise for the length of my post but I really felt like this was the appropriate place for me to tell my story. I don't know where to go to find a therapist and I do realise that I hadn't developed an eating disorder but perhaps i was on the verge of doing so. My parents both don't have a very good understanding of mental health issues. To them, my dieting was a just a phase. They dont see the damaging effect it has had on my mental health. I want to develop a healthy relationship with food but I still have a long way to go. Additionally, I still haven't had my period yet, making it a total of 8 months that i have missed it. It is worrying me but I am going to have a blood test tomorrow. \n\nThank you if you have read this all the way to the end. I really would appreciate if anyone could give me some advice on how to deal with my body image or where i could go to find some help. I want to improve myself and I feel like this is a good place to start. \n\nPS: Also I want to emphasize that myfitnesspal isn't a bad app. I honestly think it is a reliable way of ensuring weight loss that is consistent and controlling your appetite. For some people, this is really useful. However, if you have tendencies to be obsessive (like me) I would suggest you stray away from calorie counting apps in general.

In other words, it becomes an obsession to figure out how much I *\"truly\"* weigh.\n\nBut you know what? **Scales lie.** All scales are different. Some aren't truly calibrated correctly, and some are simply faulty. And a majority of the time, many will yield different results. I can be [x]lbs at home but then I'll be [x]lbs at a friends' house and the numbers can vary wildly, often times by 5+/- lbs.\n\nYou also have to consider other factors, such as *when* and *how* you weigh yourself, as well as whether or not you have just eaten, had a bowel movement, the time of day you've weighed in, your current water weight (see: after exercising) etc. There's just so many factors that affect these scales and these numbers.\n\n**Don't trust what the scale tells you.** Don't base your life and your future on the numbers that scales yield, because scales can lie.\n\nI just wanted to post this as a reminder for those who, like me, constantly weigh themselves to see what the numbers yield.

It's not like I'm unhappy about eating healthily; I actually enjoy it very much because it makes me feel wonderful.\n\nHowever, every time my menstrual cycle begins, I have to start fighting my urges to eat until I feel sick. I just start craving food. I constantly tell myself not to do it as it's happening, but it's like my hands and mouth won't listen to what my brain is saying. I start in the morning and once I start I can't stop. I'll eat constantly from the time i quit exercising until about 3 or 4 o'clock. And a lot of it isn't healthy food. For example yesterday my mom and I made gingerbread cookies yesterday and earlier today I probably ate 7 of them. I ate so much other food I can't even remember it all.\n\nWhen I finally manage to convince myself to stop eating, I always feel so disgusting and I hate myself for it. Then, the following week or so, I'll hardly eat any food at all. I'll eat a small piece of fruit or maybe some green pepper slices. One or the other.

I'm sure most of you will agree parents can be stressful amirite. At the moment I'm also coding a mood journaling app with minigames because I don't really like any of the ones in the app store. But, I have lots of anxiety about if it'll be good enough or useful to people.\n\nAnyways I had one of the worst relapses in recent memory with binge eating. I got a lot of fried chicken wings and threw up afterwards. It was sorta funny that the vomit made like a miniature anthill in the toilet. 5 Hours later, I got pizza and fries and threw up again. Slept at 6 am and woke up feeling like crap.\n\nSo, that's the story. I'm going to go for a jog now. I've lost 30 pounds in the past 3 months so that's been pretty nice. No longer waking up with a sore throat and having to deal with acid reflux as much.\n\nHopefully this post helps some people. Keep up the good fight.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I am 18 years old and currently live in a country where eating disorders are not considered important even tho everyone seems to have some kind of a problem. So, living here really makes it difficult to me to adress anyone who is a nutritionist or a psychologist, because i cannot be sure of their knowledge( i know how rude this sounds, unfortunatly).\n\nEverything started when i was 15 years old and started gainning weight due to bad eating habits. My parents told me i had started to look a bit more plumpier and that is when i realised i didn't look that good anymore. So i started starving myself and i remember how happy i was because i was feeling light...however i just gained everything back. So i started going to the gym and did 7 months of aerobic this time really eating poorely. I eat very little for a year. I lost my period and i was at my lowest weight and still thought of myself as fat. I started taking pills for my cicle and my weight started to flunctuate and i became depressed. I had never gone through something like that before. In time i started to believe that something was off and slowly started eating more till i reached to a bigger number of calories but because of underappreciation i switched to less  calories. And now here i am trying to increase my food intake again but finding it really depressing. I have to mention that right now i am at my ideal weight but i know that my metabolism is damaged and that my mental state is not really in a hsppy place and i am constantly doubting myself.\n\nMy question is, do i have an eating disorder? If so what can i do? I read about Minnie Maud, Reverse dieting, and comepletly eating everything you want. I have to mention that i also work out 4 times a week in the gym doing weights and hiit.\n\nThank you very much if you read all of this.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorderHope"}

I have a friend that i have been trying to help for about six months due to a lot of shitty things happening in her life. One of the major things is her eating disorder. From what she has talked about to me is that she has had a problem being underweight for years. Since she has moved to Houston for treatment with depression 2 years ago, she has been forced on a feeding tube a couple of times. The problem is she doesn't have negative views about her weight, and her self esteem about her looks is not an issue for her. The problem is she genuinely cannot eat cause she feels full after eating a small portion of food. Trying to eat anymore will make her feel sick. She has talked with her therapist before and neither of them can find a psychological reason for this. When it comes to calorie dense foods like sodas, she is only able to drink a little before she feels bad. She knows that it's a problem and wants to do something about it, but has a hard time talking about it. So getting a plan in action for helping her has been very difficult. As of last night, she told me it has been 4 days since she has eaten anything and her size 0 clothes are getting big on her. It's getting to the point that i feel im going to have to get in touch with her therapist to put her back on a feeding tube, as much as i know she is going to hate it. But she has told me to use my judgement when it comes to that. I'm not sure if anyone knows anyway to deal with this issue. I'm trying to see if a liquid diet will be beneficial as a calorie supplement. Has anyone felt the same way as her? Is there any sort of specific liquid diet that has worked to help make this easier?

The first few days were liquid only, to avoid some refeeding potential. I am now on solids, and have seen a few \"bump-ups\" since increasing to normal foods. My treatment is going well, so they say. The \"program\" is not very organized, and lasts 14-17 days on protocol. I'm on Day 8 or 9, now. \n\nA little background, I'm a 27 y/o male with a sort of AFRID like issue. I have celiac disease. Since I went G-free 4 years ago, I've grown more sensitive to feelings of fullness. I've a history of OCD/anxiety/perfection seeking (Type-A Driven individual.) So, my weight slowly got lower and lower over those years, to what it is/was dangerously at when I admitted. I never tried to count calories, restrict \"junk\" foods (I love sweets), binged/purged, over-exercised, or weighed myself (I actually am scared by the number of my low weight, and am just as glad not to know, yet I still fear going over where I was before diagnosed with celiac.) I've always been an active person, again by being Type-A, and I simply didn't eat enough, and took the physical cues of hunger/fullness as \"threats.\" It's a \"different\" case, I suppose, yet I'm still \"here,\" where everyone else here has suffered before...because of an eating disorder. \n\nMy family is my support system (mum, dad, aunt, brother), and have had a few meals with me here in the hospital. My insurance likely won't cover residential (which I do welcome the idea of, but the the hell out of going away and \"unplugged\" for a while.) So, either next it'll be residential, or IOP from a local clinic that seems to get good feedback. Anyhow, sorry for the life-story, but I just needed to make sure I gave a little background.\n\nThe program here is what's to be expected for a hospital. Most nurses/etc. are nice and helpful, but the last few days have seen some issues that really amped my anxiety up. ***I just wanted some outside perspective to see if anyone else has experienced issues like this before, and if so, what helped?*** Ultimately, I \\*am\\* improving, and \\*highly\\* thankful for that, and the great people who have helped me thus far. But, I still have these questions, fears, and observations...\n\n1.) Menu Plans/Mealtime: Things such as menu plans changing last-second once my meal is delivered not as I planned/ordered. My lunch was entirely wrong from what I planned today, and had pretzels (non GF) with it instead of the potatoes I wanted. Also, the \"step ups\" in food amount/cals have been a little too fast for me (like everyday, last 2 days), and I'm having trouble eating everything now. I loathe Ensure, and refuse to drink them. I know the need to increase, I \"get it,\" but I feel like I need a couple more days between step-ups, my tummy especially. Is there a way I can express this concern to my team, and get the extra days or time or mental counseling needed?\n\nI also wish that I could make swaps easier on the \"day of.\" What if I crave something different, and just want that so bad? Aside from a few nurses here, it's not a very warm or understanding place of eating disorder recovery. They pretty much throw the food at you (which the protocol calls \"therapeutic\" meal time...heeheehee.) But, hospital, so I understand. \n\n2.) Sugar-Everything: Seriously, I know it's a hospital, but I feel like every single snack I'm given is just straight sugar. The ice cream I love, but fruit juices that have no actual fruit, pudding (which again, I like so shouldn't complain), my teeth are in pain/sensitivity, get headaches and anxiety after each juice serving. :-( It sucks, because they're trying to manage my meds at the same time, but excess sugar has always given me wicked headaches. I know I sad I like junk-food, I do, but the juices are, I feel, the issue with me right now. I know \"every calorie counts,\" and it \\*is\\* a hospital, after all, but...ugh.\n\n3.) Edema: I've got it in my legs/feet right now. It has improved a bit, according to my treatment team. I'm just curious, how long, on \\*average\\* will this take to go away completely? I know everyone is different, but, it get annoying. Thank goodness for compression and elevation! LOL!\n\n4.) Set-Point: I fear that once I hit my \"set point\" weight, whatever it may be, that I won't want to eat the junk food I love again, due to fear of \"going over\" (perfectionist mindset.) What are some exercises or strategies I can develop right now to help me be ready for this? I just want to be a happy, active, and fit person. I want to be free of this, but also no at the polar opposite end of the spectrum. \n\n5.) Prozac: I was on Paxil for \\~15 years, and tapered off it last winter. I went \"back on\" last Spring @ 10mg (took 20mg for the 15 years before), and now they've completely taken me off it, here in the hospital, to put me on Prozac 10mg, with a boost to 20mg tomorrow. I feel this is too fast for me, I am anxious enough about the recent food-amount increases, medication side-effects are a whole 'nother anxiety causer/trigger in me. Am I now gonna balloon up to be a mush-pile, because apparently everyone becomes a pant-load on Prozac (even though I managed to loos on Paxil, unintentionally.) \n\n**TL:DR; It's just a lot, and I'm overwhelmed. I'm sorry for the long post, but I need some peer support and \"warmth.\" Thank you all, for listening. I wish you all the best, as well, wherever you are in your journey back to health and freedom.**", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I\u2019ve always  been a tad bit overweight or near it. This caused a lot of body image  issues and I\u2019ve always hated my body for this reason. So around june or  july twenty-seventeen I decided i was gonna loose weight. So i tried  going vegetarian. That worked out for about a month or so but when i  realized i wasn\u2019t loosing weight i went back to my old eating habits.  Fast forward to mid september. I discovered pro-ana communities and I  was fascinated. I wanted to be as skinny as the girls in the photos. So I  started to eat less and less. Then I started to exercise frequently. I  saw results and had lost very little at this point.Then I started to  purge anything I ate. It started off slow like maybe once or twice a  week? Then it picked up to once every day. I then started to use  laxatives. They didn\u2019t really work for me but I still used them because I  simply didn\u2019t want to give them up. Then I found weight loss pills in  the kitchen cabinet and started taking those. So by this point I had  lowered my calorie intake quite a bit, and then purging was with that.  Often I would do twenty four hour fasts but after completing them I\u2019d  binge massively. Binging became a huge thing I did. It got to the point  where I had a bag in my room so I didn\u2019t have to go to the bathroom to  purge. Then January twenty eighteen came around and I decided to do a  liquid fast for the month of January. This went well for about a week or  so then my parents made me eat spaghetti and I had a literal break  down. At that point I had lost a decent amount of weight but was still a  healthy weight.After the whole spaghetti incident, I lost control and  started binging constantly. I gained the weight back a few extra pounds  and was fine and nobody knew for months. I returned to eating normally  and then came july of twenty eighteen I started getting awful thoughts  about starving myself and did it for about a week then went back to  normal eating and that is what\u2019s been going on up until now. I\u2019m eating  normally and all but still purge sometimes when I can\u2019t stand the  feeling of being full.  \n\n I\u2019m sorry this was lengthy. I\u2019ve been thinking and have thought that maybe I was doing this for attention. But at the same time why would I do it for attention? I made sure nobody knew. I don\u2019t know anymore. I know I should probably see a counselor but honestly the thought of that terrifies me. ", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

My biggest concern is quitting purging. I'm at a normal BMI and have been for the duration of my ED (5+ years), and thankfully my therapist is on the same page with me about not needing to gain weight. I binge occasionally but basically never like the stereotypical hugeass binges on junk food. I restrict occasionally (never hardcore  or really &lt;1000) and I'm willing to eat at/near maintenance (and usually do) but am terrified of gaining weight (&amp; still want to lose some tbh but not to dangerous levels), and have a lot of fear of carb-heavy, \"unhealthy foods\" and don't like to eat them as much. A lot of times when I purge its moreso from overeating than a binge (or eating a larger caloric amount in one meal even if its healthy food &amp; I'm not out of control). Bulimia is the closest of the DSM-recognized EDs to mine and what I consider myself, but again no two EDs are the same/manifest in the same behaviors.\n\nI've been trying to find podcasts and stories about/from people in sorta similar situations as me, most importantly on quitting purging and not needing weight restoration. But like a solid 90% of the stuff I find is either significantly focused on hardcore restriction or weight gain and I can't relate/it doesn't help. Like I don't need to sit in bed eating 3000 calories a day for a month, or be told that I shouldn't exercise at all, or that gaining weight is critical for my recovery and that I shouldn't deny it. None of those apply to me. \n\nAll I want is to hear a little more of shit that actually applies to me (i.e. I MAY gain weight (though I don't need to) and need to be ok with fluctuations, I need to do whatever I can to avoid purging, accept that I'll occasionally subjectively/objectively overeat, how to increase the range of foods I'm willing to eat on a regular basis). I know I'm not the only one like this. But it feels like I am a lot.

But it's also not like it's a leisurely ride either, I do usually try to push myself.\n\nI can say I exercise every day (or 5-7x/wk), but then it seems like the numbers are wayyyyy off, for instance JustCICO says I will hit 200 before March if I exercise 5-7x/wk, but saying the same on Losertown puts me at 200 two weeks later, but it calls my daily activity \"Very active, strenuous exercise 6-7x/week\". So I do exercise 6-7 times a week, sometimes \"twice a day\" considering errands, but in my mind I'd hardly call my physical activity strenuous.

The concept didn't make any sense to me... how could you just let go of all rules and everything and \"eat what you want\"?\n\nI was recovering from a weird ED version of restricting all day then \"binging\" on 1000-1500 cals (my daily tdee) so I just had a really bad plan. I decided to \\~recover\\~ by \"eating what I wanted\" (what I thought IE was). I gained so much weight. I hated it and myself. \n\nAnd then a while later I tried it again ... and I realized the concept of IE is *not* \"eat what you want\". It's more like \"eat what your body wants\". IE is more like \"don't think of hunger as coming from the brain; think of hunger as coming only from your stomach &amp; body\"..\n\nTo break it down, here are the ~~rules~~ suggestions:\n\n* **listen to your stomach**. is there anything your stomach doesn't react well to? for me it's dairy. Do you eat it anyway during binges? probably. But now it's time to think of your stomach. It doesn't matter what your brain is thinking. It's time to give your stomach a break. Did you just eat? give it a break, let it digest some food. give it some time to before making it go back to work. don't overload it. has it been a while since you've eaten and you're genuinely hungry? sure, eat, but something gentle that will give you a non-sudden, gentle, nutritious reaction.\n* **listen to your body** as a whole. if your body is out of balance, you can't function well and you will always feel + be in a bad head-space, which increases overeating. so you should listen to how your body is feeling or think of how it would make you feel if you ate something. for example, I try to keep my sugar consumption low because if I don't my body will be out of balance and will try to \"regulate\" itself by wanting the exact opposite of sweet to counteract the high sugar - something like low sweet, but high in bad fats. So in order to stop my body from going between extremes, I'd rather just keep it consistent, or regulate it. Same thing with high salt - I avoid high salt foods because for the rest of the day I'll be super thirsty and eating/drinking a lot to make the feeling go away. I avoid anything that makes my body become unpredictable/unstable. \n* if you really want to eat, then eat. if you deny eating and your body+stomach both want to eat, you're just encouraging a binge to happen later. but, **if you want to eat (and it makes sense to eat), make it nutritious**. I always try to make my go-to meal like a vegetable meal or something because it's nutritious, low calorie, and will satisfy a binge craving way more than having a pizza. Actually IRL both will not satisfy a binge craving immediately, but *over time* the vegetables will decrease the amount + intensity of binges. This is because if you have some addictive junk food to eat during a binge craving, your mind will go \"yes, I got my reward, it's pretty great, I'll have the same thing next time\" but if you respond to your binge craving with vegetables, your mind will go \"I didn't get what I wanted... it's not as satisfying so I don't want it that bad next time\" and eventually the binges will diminish.\n\nTLDR: IE =/= \"eating what you want\". IE = eating what is good for your body, and listening to how the food makes your stomach + body feel.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

This is not something 100% new. I've been down this road before. \n\nI was at an awful place before I started the weight loss, eating constantly, and felt so unattractive that I just completely took my health in my hands last January. But then it got really bad really quick. I am really dizzy, I can't sleep. My hands shake and I bruise so easily. \n\nI went through a breakup that I could see coming a mile away in 2018, I knew I wanted to look different. I didn't want to mess around so I just **lost the weight**. I started out very healthy/on keto and got so much praise and so many compliments. \n\nEventually I started working out and rather than stalling my weight loss, the exercise actually accelerated it. I no longer saw plateaus and even lost more quickly despite taking frequent cheat days.\n\nThen the behavior got suddenly really obsessive. I was so stressed over the calorie content at a small meal at lunch so often that I switched to intermittent fasting. I ate once a day, and IF is so trendy! I'm fine!\n\nOnce again, I've been through this 100 times, but it never got this bad. Not even when I was a teenager. I started purging, then Binging then Purging. Then I stepped on the scale. Then I made spreadsheets depicting the continued freefall and dreaming of even lower numbers.  I started incorporating Nicotine through a Juul (*I know, ICK*).\n\nI lied to my mom and told my boyfriend (no longer my bf) that he's not allowed to bring food into the house. I can't fall asleep if there's pizza in the fridge.\n\nEveryone asked me how I did it, I could never have the audacity to say, \"Oh I just hate myself\".\n\nRecently, my boss (M, 55) asked my coworker and very close friend, \"Is UQ4120 losing this much weight because of her breakup?\"\n\n\n*My reaction: what a misogynistic way of seeing what's happening!*\n\n\nSo judgmental, like we can't be motivated to lose weight, or even lose control of the weight loss a little bit unless there's a man involved??\n\nAnyway, today I was recovering from an injury in the gym (he's experienced in this kind of recovery, he recommended Epsom salts). We were talking about exercise, and he told me straight out, \"You should really stop losing weight\".\n\nI was surprised but I told him, I know, my parents are concerned too. It's been a crazy year and I'm on a health journey, just trying to find a balance.\n\nThen he told me that his oldest daughter was anorexic. \n\nI was skeptical, some parents call their daughters anorexic without knowing what it means. \n\n\n*Me: Did she ever go inpatient?\n\nHim: No, but she went to Renfrew. Twice. At her worst, her BP was two points above being sent to the ER.\n\nMe: Oh that's awful. Is she ok now?*\n\nHe told me this is something that people suffer with for the rest of their life. It's not something to be ignored and it put a big strain on him and his wife to watch her suffer through it.\n\nI was really floored. I thought it was a miscategorized PSA when the conversation started. I never expected that he's been affected by it so closely.\n\nI have an appointment with my Psychologist next week, and my Psychiatrist in early February. I'm not ready to talk to my psychiatrist about help, but my psychologist has already told me to try to stop fasting and take notes at how I feel during mealtimes. \n\nI don't know. This is awful. Why am I embarrassing myself like this? I have to be a professional. I'm 30 years old. \n\nI wanted to get my life on track, and I thought I was in that process. Too bad, all of a sudden I am paralyzed with fear at the thought of being near a birthday cake on my birthday (next week).\n\nI am terrified that bartenders are giving me regular coke instead of diet so I log the calories of a vodka with regular coke.\n\nI've bartended before. I know that what I'm going through is paranoia. \n\nI don't know what the point of this is, just I guess I'm... disappointed in myself for not expecting his concern to be genuine. I thanked him and he told me he's here if I ever want to talk about it. And he apologized in case he was way off. I said he's actually not that far off, I'm just trying to get stable right now.

A list of reasons I haven't yet.", "author": "NutelllaBellla", "self_text": "TL;DR: Rant about falling back into binging and purging, my teeth, and a list of reasons I want to stop, a list of why I haven't. \n\n  I'm an idiot. Honestly. About two weeks ago when winter  break at my university and the holidays started, I made a post about falling back into binging and purging. It was all rah rah in 2019 I'll be binge and purge free! One last b/p to \"celebrate\". \n\n  I'm stupid. That one last one turned into two weeks and I feel another week coming. I have one more week of break. I hate the chipmunk cheeks that purging causes so when I have places to be that's my motivation to avoid purging. I had quit altogether for so long. But now, not having to see anyone I let it get out of control and don't even know if I'll be able to stop by the time classes start. Look, I have no clue how my teeth are not yet screwed up. Maybe because I take really good care of them, otherwise? Maybe because I am not knee-deep into this quicksand disorder? Maybe because I should stop NOW before they do get messed up. The lists: \n\nWhy I want to stop (very vain) :\n\n1). I care about my teeth. A lot. I have every tooth care thing you can imagine and am meticulous with it. Stomach acid = Battery acid.\n\n2). Muscle tone loss. It's hard to work out when I don't have enough energy and my electrolytes are fucked up from purging, it's hard to keep down enough protein when I purge every day. \n\n3). Weight loss is stalled. I want to restrict and consistently lose weight. I'm 4 lbs away from my GW. But obviously with b/p you can't be sure how much food you actually get rid of and I have maintained / lost weight a crawl for the past 2 weeks\n\n4). Chipmunk face: always insecure about my jaw line. Well? Purging makes it 10\u00d7 worse. \n\n5). Eye bags and saggy skin with a blotchy complexion. \n\n6). Hair loss. What's the point of taking hair vitamins and vitamins in general if I'm purging them and my hair is thinning out? \n\n7). Ugly hands. Scraped knuckles and no nail polish because what's the point of a manicure that stomach acid will destroy...\n\n8). Time consuming. Gets in the way of my grades. \n\n9). Gross. The clean up process is so gross and shitty. I used to be clean, organized, a germaphobe. Now? I grab puke with my bare hands. I put my bare hands in the toilet. I shower in a puked up smelly bathtub. \n\n10). My sister. We live together. She shouldn't have to put up with my gross ass puke, the shower turning cold because I ran the water too long before she got home from a long 2nd shift at 12 am. She shouldn't have to put up with me digging through her shit looking for alcohol and candy to binge and purge on. She shouldn't have to put up with all the trash and waste that I leave in our apartment after a b/p. This is ruining how we get along and I hate it. \n\n11). Reproductive health. I lost my period from losing weight fast. But I heard that you can actually permanently mess up reproductive health by messing up your internal organs from bulimia. Along those lines, I'm having trouble breathing after purging. \n\n12). It's expensive. Even cheap alcohol and junk food adds up over time. The water bill goes up. And because I get cold after purging, the electric bill. It wastes trash bags and cleaning products, and I have to wash a bunch of towels and clothes each week. \n\nWhy I haven't been able to stop:\n\n1). Anxiety. Leads to me being alone a lot, still wanting to \"unwind\". \n\n2). Drinking. Drinking alone to \"unwind\" because I have no friends. Feeling amazing. Feeling no anxiety. Forgetting all my fuck ups and the fact that everyone hates me and I can't make friends or be social. \n\n3). Food. Getting that \"fuck it all let's binge eat too\" feeling after drinking, proceeding to pig out.\n\n4). Weight. Freaking out because *shit now I pigged out and I have to get rid of it before it turns in to fat!* purge. Step on scale. Purge. Step on scale. All afternoon until the puke is clear and I'm sure I got most of it out. \n\n5). Food. I throw out the alcohol so I won't binge right? Wrong. No alcohol. Anxious.... hmmm let's binge and purge even without alcohol! Buys more the next week to get that \"one last drunken b/p\". IDIOT. \n\n6). The \"perfect binge\". That last binge was half- assed. Now I need one last one with cheap alcohol and all of my favorite food. \n\n7). *My teeth aren't fucked up yet so I'm getting away with this all, right?*\n\n8). The more I purge, the easier the food comes up and the more I get out. This makes it more tempting.  \n\n9). *I don't have to see anyone any day soon so it's totally alright to have chipmunk cheeks, righhhht?*\n\n10). It's time consuming. Its emotion numbing. While I'm doing this, I don't have to focus on anything else in my life. Until I do. \n\n", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

Both times left me a little confused and disappointed in myself, but I still felt fine about myself overall.

I\u2019m really struggling here. \n\nDAE workout regularly and struggle even more with their ED? \n\nBetween *trying* (and usually failing) to restrict, having massive binges only to purge every crumb I can out, and actively working on getting stronger in the gym I feel like I\u2019m just digging deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole. Things seem to just be getting worse. My weight is consistent on the scale but my body looks so flabby and disgusting... wtf is happening?\n\nNothing works. Last year, while I was still in college, I had 0 appetite. I got super skinny because I was simply never hungry. I would drink a monster and a frappicino a day and run for 20-30 mins at night and be perfectly fine. Fast forward to now: 20 pounds up and this intense all-consuming hunger overpowers everything and I have to eat. This triggers the binge, which triggers the purge, which makes me dizzy and lethargic when it\u2019s exercise time, which leads to a half-assed workout where I only worry about cardio and calories burned. \n\nHow do you folks cope?

I have eaten above my TDEE several times this month, which logically I know isn't that big of a deal but I'm keenly watching the scale and it's quite steady. Is there a specific window for weight gain after overeating, like a week or something? I'm just freaking out and finding it difficult to calm myself.\n\nAnd about that: I have noticed the shift in my mindset. At first, when I started into this in June, I was overweight and wanted to get back to my 2014 weight (healthy BMI but close to under). Now I'm several kilos under that and want to go a little lower. I'm body-checking more frequently and keep getting upset and agitated about gaining - more so than before. The recent instances of overeating are breaking a long restrictive pattern that I'm clawing my way back into because I feel like anything else is unacceptable. I've gotten more secretive and deceptive in the last two months, lying about what I've eaten, hiding then throwing away food given to me. Fear for my health is there but much more muted than before. Last month I reached out to an eating disorder specialist to arrange group and individual therapy. I came clean to my current therapist about my food issues but I feel like I'm careening back and forth between the pre-contemplation and contemplation phases of accepting that I need to recover and to get help. My chief need seems to be the new gold-standard number on the scale and now I'm ghosting the specialist because suddenly I'm in deep.\n\nI feel like if I know that I'll be getting some delayed weight gain, at least I'll have certainty and can plan for it. I only purge sporadically but I feel like it'll increase if I keep feeling this panicked. \n\nI feel weird, guys. Just tell me I won't put on 5kg from a week of overeating.

I binge to comfort myself when I feel really lonely and sad, it's the same routine each time: lay on the couch and eat while I watch a movie, purge when I start feeling really sick and too full to eat anymore.\n\nI just go to the store beforehand and buy some junk food. I decide to do this kinda spontaneously, I'll be thinking about it, trying to dismiss the thought, then deciding \"fuck it, let's go.\"\n\nIt doesn't make me feel better, though. It just makes me stressed afterwards. I think this is why my skin is looking really bad and why I often feel physically ill and lethargic. It makes me feel like I have to work really hard in the days afterwards to eat less, exercise more, go back to \"normal\" and try to be healthy again.\n\nAnd it makes me feel like I can't see anybody(like, make social plans) until I'm \"back to normal\", otherwise I think I look bloated or something from the binging.\n\nMy weight has stayed the same which is surprising. I thought surely I'd be gaining. I'm very worried about all this binging making me fat because I place a lot of value on not getting fat. It's weird because I think my self-esteem is usually positive and good, but I'm so focused on me not gaining weight because I worry that if I do, I will feel terribly about myself, when I was a higher weight I felt awful.\n\nI'd like more control. Binging and purging makes me very secretive. Making sure I buy my junk food at the store as quickly as possible, even going to different stores so they don't remember, oh that's the person who always buys the junk food.\n\nI can't afford therapy or treatment but if I could I really would refuse to go because honestly I have a phobia of treatment from bad experiences when I was in high school.

Can anyone provide me with some psychological input as to why he simply severed our seemingly loving relationship? On a side note.. 4 years ago my Fiance committed suicide after an argument we had.

It randomly popped up between some 'feel-good' stuff like color-blind people using glasses to see color for the first time and LadyLike.  It was shocking.  That woman's struggles were my struggles.  I have never met anyone else who dealt with this issue before.  If I've known someone with it then they've never talked about it, which is understandable.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sort of talk about my binging with my friends, but I don't think I make it sound as big as it is.  I pretend to be proud of eating large quantities of food but I am actually ashamed.  We all love food and love talking about eating all the food in existence.  We love planning monthly trips to all-you-can-eats so that we can stuff our faces and really get our money's worth.  But their amount that constitutes overeating and my amount are very different.  Don't get me wrong... they still overeat... but if I am at the right level of stress then I could probably be on one of those ridiculous eating shows where people compete to eat monstrous amounts of food and I will somehow not even realize that I've eaten that much.  I don't have a healthy relationship food to begin with.  I should see a buffet as a chance to try small amount of lots of things until just before I am full... but my mind doesn't allow that mentality.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started to describe that the binging happens in episodes... but I think that might be a bit deceitful.  It is more likely that my will-power lasts for episodes depending on how many spoons I have to devote toward 'not eating'.  Some days I'm doing great and I don't binge at all.  On a rougher day, I might have one kitchen session where I try to weight out my portions but I can't get myself to leave the kitchen.  I bounce from a portion of chips to eating an apple (cause that is healthier) to another serving of chips to a banana (gotta make up for that second serving of chips with something healthy again) and then another serving of chips, and then that cookie looks good and yeah... before I know it I've stopped logging my food and I've eaten probably 4000-5000 kcals.  I create faulty logic of binging with \"healthy\" and unhealthy foods that I honestly couldn't justify if asked about.  If I don't beat myself up too badly then I might only have that one session... but I generally feel guilt, self loathing, depressed, ect.  Then binging episodes can last a few days or longer.  I don't really understand it either.  I lose all impulse control but I honestly don't gain any relief.  I can even tell myself that I won't feel relieved afterward but during the binge I think that just one more 'whatever' will make me feel full and then I will also feel better.  Nope.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI struggled with this my whole life.  I don't know where it comes from.  Then again... I have a lot of issues from my past that I considered normal until my boyfriend told me they weren't.  2 years ago it got really bad.  We had just moved to Europe and it was really stressful.  I was already obese, but gained another 40 lbs in 2-3 months.  I was miserable, emotionally unstable, and confused.  This is when I started seeing a therapist.  I've made a lot of progress in becoming more emotionally aware, and last year I resolved to have it be my year of weight loss!  I wanted to lose 1 lb per week, with a goal of 50 lbs for the year.  I created an environment of extreme food and exercise structure and I had the binging under control.  In 3 months I lost 25 lbs, and then my structure fell apart.  I couldn't stay living in my 'controlled environment bubble'.  My boyfriend's parents were visiting and they wanted to go sight-seeing and eat in restaurants.  This meant I couldn't obsess about my calorie counting.  I was weighing everything at the time and wanted to make sure I got the most out of every possible kcal I ate.  I have a horrible all-or-nothing mentality.  The first day out of my bubble, I felt ok.  I felt strong.  I felt like maybe I could be a normal human that ate normal portions and enjoyed eating whatever in moderation.  That strength collapsed quickly.  I got stressed.  I felt out of control.  I got more stressed.  Stress plants the seed of wanting food.  Not just 1 piece of cake... but the whole cake.  And the ice cream.  And the chips.  And the bag of carrots.  Everything.  The rest of last year was a set of steep upward and downward fluctuations.  I did manage to end the year still having lost 25 lbs.  Progress is progress, no matter how small.   I keep telling myself that hoping that I will someday actually convince myself.  Ugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is a bit of a relief to realize that I have binge eating disorder.  The thing I struggle with has a name.  It has other people who understand, people who are struggling unsuccessfully that maybe I can relate to, and people who struggle successfully that I can learn from.  I'm googling and seeing what I can learn about dealing with this.  Hoping that maybe I can figure this out and potentially pursue weight loss again.  Aiming for weight loss while dealing with this is probably too large of a battle to fight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:  I watched a youtube video and found out I am not the only person struggling with uncontrollable episodes of eating.  Relieved to have found this and now a new struggle begins.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

Helping the masses, by setting up a Discord server that specialised in supporting people, as they attempt to manage their eating disorders. It, alongside all my other attempts have been focused on recovery.\n\nMy server saw some success for some time, but had to be discontinued after a couple of year, as it fell out of use. I've also volunteered my time to other communities that had similar aims. \n\nMy most recent attempt, has been where I've seen the most success. It's something that's impractical to scale. This story will be in steps. \n\n1. I sought help, through a public forum, asking if anyone would help me manage a panic attack. \n2. A friend answered my call for help and did so privately, the way I preferred. I opened up and told them about my ten year history fighting anorexia and my recent relapse. The panic attack had been induced by my latest meal. \n3. After some time, weeks, they started opening up about their problems and asked me if I could help. I gave them my terms and they agreed to them. \n4. This person is submissive by nature and after seeing some result, they asked me to become their Mistress. I saw this as an opportunity to help them with other aspects of their lives too, so I accepted. \n5. Their eating habits massively improved, as did other aspects of their life. Once it became apparent I had helped all I could, we agreed to split ways.\n\nAll that within the last few months. In really happy that I've been able to have such a massive impact on someone's life. We are staying in touch, so I can see if they are able to continue what I thought them without daily prodding and influence.\n\nI realise that this approach will not be for all. If someone tells me what to do in regards to eating, I'm gonna tell them to eat horse shit for instance. \n\nI'm therefore wondering what I, as a member of this community can do to have the most significant positive impact upon it. Any ideas? \n\nThe most impactful thing I've done, in my opinion is to be open about my struggles and successes, something I continue to do, outside of focused communities. The people who need to know they are not alone, will most likely be found outside of ED specific communities after all.\n\nI feel I've rambled on long enough and 30 hours of no sleep is definitely not helping me articulate well.

Based on how/how much I've recently eaten I can generally guess how much water weight/food weight I'll gain from a meal or binge, and also how much of it will come off overnight or how much will come off with a fast or how much will come off if I purge with laxatives etc. I'm used to seeing pretty big fluctuations on the scale, and it's taken me a few years but I had predicting them down to a science.\n\nAnd then. Right before new years. I went to a weight lifting class with my mom. I thought I wanted to get into weights and all, and while I was super sore for a couple days after I don't really mind soreness and I know it would have been better if I had kept going. But the weight. The water weight. The water weight for the recovery of muscles. That water weight.\n\nI ate my normal, restricted amount the day I did that class. And I had weighed myself that morning, and it was where I expected it to be. And I weighed myself the next morning, and I was *more than seven and a half pounds heavier.* And I stayed right at that weight, did not budge for four days. I fasted, I used laxatives, I use diuretics, I sweat my ass off doing cardio, I shaved my body and cut my nails and exfoliated like fuck in the vain hope that I could remove enough dead skin to make that number drop, and it didn't. For four. Days.\n\nAnd finally it went down... a little. And then as soon as I broke my fast it went back up, which I expected. But then it should have gone back down, leveled out, and it didn't. It's been *two weeks* since I did that class, and those have been two weeks of my weight patterns being completely different and unpredictable.\n\nI was 148 before the class, and 155.8 after. I haven't been below 150.2 in two weeks, and have mostly hovered around 152.4. I'm losing my shit, let me back into the 140s!\n\nIt doesn't drop at all if I restrict. If I eat a single bite, it goes up. Purging does next to nothing. It only drops when I fast, but it doesn't drop as much as I expect it to. I eat restricted for one day, I have to fast for two to get back to where I was. And you know what? It's stressing me out so much, along everything feel so futile that it's triggering binges. And my weight goes up when I binge, but it goes up about the same amount as when I fast too.\n\nIt's not going up like I expect it to. It's not going down like I expect it to.

{"post_id": "af23hi", "created_utc": 1547253712, "title": "Open Letter to BED - What you have taken from me", "author": "intuitivelyhealing", "self_text": " \n\nAs much as I would like to think that this cruel disorder has not \"taken\" anything from me...that would be a lie...it would be me escaping from my previous reality. I also write this not to dig up the past but to explain to the world how messy things can get when you travel down the path of disordered eating. We hear so much about certain eating disorders but not so much about others. As someone in recovery it's important to share my story in hopes that it will reach people who need to read this or perhaps friends/family of people going through this.\n\nThis is my letter...this is part of my story. This is just part one. Yes Binge eating has taken away from me but as you will come to see - being in recovering has given me a new lease on life.\n\nDear Binge Eating Disorder:\n\nLets start off as a child...you dug your claws in young and taught me from the start to fulfill myself with food in secret. You taught me to dislike eating in front of others which still, to this day makes social gatherings kind of awkward for me. You set me on the path of yo-yo dieting young. I would add an unnecessary amount of stress and pressure on my body which would lead to things like autoimmune, early PMS and anxiety. You taught me to self soothe with unhealthy food and an unhealthy amount of food rather than things like nature, friendship or exercise. You taught me to hate food even though I have now learned to love it. You taught me to be obsessed with my body, body fat, looks, clothing etc. I always felt the need to be put together in public. You made me spend many days in front of the mirror analyzing every roll. Many of my memories are consumed by you.\n\nNext...you took away a great portion of my teens and most of my 20s. Every friendship, every relationship, almost every situation was governed by this nasty disorder. I grew very introverted and shied away from being outside in public. I would lay in bed and eat all day and night and nobody really knew how to help me because ...well there was never really that much information on it. Plus I was really good at concealing things except for the crazy amount of weight gain.\n\n\u00a0People just thought I was a fat, lazy slob. It got in the way of how I performed academically and socially. All I could think about was getting that next high off that next binge - like a drug addict on cocaine. I remember one instance where I went out for coffee with some friends in my university days...on the way home I picked up mcdonalds and ate that, I then ate dinner with my roomates and after that I ordered Swiss Chalet take in which was enough for 3 people to eat. I thought my roomates had all left but turned out that they came back early. I will never forget the confused and horrified look on their faces when they watched me run upstairs to my dingy little room with 4 bags of takeout. It wasn't their job to understand and probably past their realm of comprehension anyways. Another night passed out, sore, dehydrated, full of gas and heartburn - but also like a feeling of relief.\u00a0 I can never really describe it and you probably won't understand unless you have been through it. With that being said...lots of friendships crumbled and I don't blame them for distancing themselves from me at that point in time.\n\n\u00a0This disorder was developed over a really long time and progressed slowly but surely. It was the culmination of many things and I just wasn't able to cope or wade through the mud at that age and stage in my life and didn't really have many people to help me through. It's definitely an uncomfortable situation and many people would rather choose to ignore uncomfortable situations or pretend they don't exist. Some people just don't feel equipped to help. When I quit dance and had all of this new freedom I basically didn't really know how to handle it all. I went balls to the wall from crazy regimented routine to 100 percent freedom. Why this happened to me? I'm not quite sure but theres a lesson somewhere and here we are today. Many people don't ever get out of the binge eating cycle...so I'm greatful that I have managed too. I don't eat as healthy as I would like to but I'm taking babysteps there every day.\n\nYou took so much of my life. You broke my spirit. Took my innocence. Stomped on my passions. Buried my self confidence and put lasting damage on my liver, organs and immune system. You filled me with a candida overgrowth that I still sometimes struggle with today. You set my emotions on a rollercoaster of cruel lows yet sometimes life was good so I had to balance it all and conceal those emotions to myself - crying myself to sleep most nights. I don't write this for pity or for some strange satisfaction. But to give others hope that just because you have lived my story or are living my story...it won't define you. You can and will wade through the mud and dig yourself out. It might take 30 years but you will get there. ", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

It works to tackle my fear foods and kcal limits and counting obsessions, and even when I relapse now I no longer have those hang-ups for the most part. That being said, I am currently relapsing. Another important thing - this is for weight maintenance while you tackle your relationship with food, as I believe the relationship with food and not feeling in control is the primary symptom and the body hate is the secondary symptom as you see it as a result of not being in control of your food intake. Please, if you are at a dangerous weight, raise the cal suggestions by about 500-1000.*\n\n*the goal with this is to provide structure to self help recovery in people obsessed with counting calories, safe foods, and restricting below the daily recommended minimum of 1200 cal*\n\n*please take down or lmk and I will take it down if not allowed*\n\nEveryday in this plan there will be a loose cal suggestion, please do not aim for under, aim for at or over. Most days there will also be a fear food challenge. There are breaks for you to recharge, though.\n\nA good plan if you want to try recovery but\u2026:\n- You don\u2019t want to gain that fast in order to save your mental state &amp; relationship to your body\n- You want to get used to eating normally and having a structure to avoid binges and extreme hunger\n- You want to see how you feel eating a little bit more, even if you just plan on maintaining\n- You can\u2019t fathom not counting calories yet\n\nSuggestions RE: B/P, exercise, cal counting\n\n- Try not to binge within this week. It\u2019ll set you\u2019re. Progress back as there are higher kcal goals and your ED brain will most likely panic even more.\n\n- Try not to be too hard on yourself if you don't eat under/at the calorie suggestions. They're suggestions to get you used to higher daily intake and a feel for what food and meal combos will get you to a daily calorie amount that isn't restricting below a recommended minimum cal count.\n\n- Try to exercise non strenuously for 20-40 min 3 or 4 days this week. That\u2019s about the sweet spot to feel good with the endorphins and energy boost from exercising, while not going off the deep end with your ED brain trying to exercise off these extra calories, or (maybe sub-consciously) trying to sabotage yourself by staying dormant and feeling awful.\n\nMondays: 1200 kcal - no fear food challenges yet. Just get a feel for a higher kcal guideline.\n\nTuesdays: 1350 kcal - at least 100 kcal from a non alcoholic drink (like juice or coffee with milk/sugar/honey instead of just black, etc.)\n\nWednesdays: 1250 kcal - at least 200 kcal from a whole food or associated condiment/piece of that meal that happens to be a fear food (eg rice, pasta, a higher cal fruit, bread/ a sandwich with a fear food, a salad with a higher cal dressing)\n\nThursdays: Your choice of kcal count and fear food challenging. Give yourself a break, however you feel you need it.\n\nFridays: 1400 kcal - if you\u2019re of age, have an alcoholic drink that you think is really yummy but the kcal count scares you. If you don\u2019t drink or aren\u2019t of age, have a virgin cocktail (not one of those 0 cal mixes though.) Lots of grocery stores have pre made mai-tai or blue Hawaiian etc mixes. If you\u2019re not a fan of cocktails, have some tonic water; it\u2019s like sparkling water, but has calories and sugar.\n\nSaturdays: Your choice of kcal, but one meal should be eaten out if you can afford it. Wether it\u2019s Tim Hortons oatmeal or soup, or an egg white breakfast sandwich, to a creamy pasta at a local restaurant, challenge your fear of not knowing how something is prepared, even if it\u2019s still low cal. If you ca't eat a meal from a restaurant, even a fast food place, have a meal that someone else has made. Share your goal of recovery with a friend or family and ask them to make you a meal to challenge this fear.\n\nThe first Sunday: Try your old calorie limit / eating habits. See how far you\u2019ve come in a week, see which one you like better, see which one is more sustainable, see which one makes you feel better, see which option your family and friends support more. I promise it\u2019ll be the one described here. Repeat the week if it\u2019s this one.\n\nSundays after the first one (should you choose to continue): Have a whole day where at least one component of each meal is a fear food (and yes, 3 square meals, they can be low cal if you\u2019d like though). Wether it\u2019s the high cal instant oats for breakfast, a sandwich with full fat mayo for lunch, and pasta with the higher cal sauce you used to love for dinner; or a whole day diving into your fear foods head-on, I want every meal you have to have one challenge for you.\n\n*Hope you find this helpful, and I really hope you give something like it a try and aim for full recovery.*", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I have been through hell with this disorder and it breaks me to constantly feel like I'm being told I'm not sick enough to be cared about, not sick enough to eat more, and not sick enough to get better.

And once I got a little taste, I was hooked. \n\nSince I had no school, I walked every day to the bakery - treating myself a pastry a day (of course with normal meals too). I thought I was doing well, with the 80-20 rule and all. They always do say, keep it balanced! But the problem with me was I didn't know when to stop.\n\nIt all started to worsen and spiral down from Thursday, where I got a snickers bar, a cone ice cream, pastries and some mini chocolate muffins. And then on Friday, I had 2 bakery pastries (both of which had an unhealthy amount of empty calories), 3 muffins and guesz what, an ice cream cone. \n\nWhat's worse is that after all the sugar, I felt so bad. My body felt loopy and I just felt horrid- and I promised myself not to do it the next day. Hiho come Saturday- I ate 12 small potato rolls and even proceeded to eat a whole packet of red bean buns I promised I would keep for tomorrow if the \"binge monster\" reared its head. But nope. I devoured it ALL. \n\nSo now, out of curiosity, I weighed myself and voila. 54.4kgs.

For the two sims that look like me, I also selected the traits glutton, gloomy, and clumsy. So I started playing and my sims\u2019 lives started mirroring my own life. The fat sim would constantly be crying because of loneliness (I kept her in the house for days and didn\u2019t let her talk to people much. Literally, she started talking to plants for social interaction). But the 2 skinny sims never had that problem and I realized I was more social and outgoing when playing them. I also had them form romantic relationships with other sims, but I kept the fat sim alone because I felt like she would look weird with normal sized sims. I even rejected a date because I just felt she didn\u2019t belong in a relationship. Overall, I treated her more poorly than I would my other sims... not intentionally, but I was thinking about it today and realized how unconsciously biased I was because of their weights. But she\u2019s also my most successful sim career-wise (she\u2019s a style influencer/beauty guru) and I put a ton of effort into leveling her skills in comparison to my other sims. In my mind whenever something good happened to her, like a promotion or having a not negative interaction with another sim, I would think \u201creally?

How did I determine that? I asked myself \u2013 would you rather be homeless and skinny or rich and fat and the answer is homeless and skinny (I\u2019m a woman if this seems odd to any men). So I ask myself why it is that I want this so deeply and painfully that I think about it millions of times a day and it is constantly reinforced to me in society and in my experience that thin women are treated better, have greater opportunities, and let\u2019s face it \u2013 hotter guys like them. Do I sound shallow as shit?\n\nYes, but perhaps I am only reflecting on the true shallowness and ugliness of society as it is and not how we wish it was.\n\nI grew up being the fat friend. By fat, I mean I was a healthy weight but on the upper end of a healthy BMI while my best friends were underweight \u2013 but I didn\u2019t realize this at the time. What I did realize is that boys liked them and people listened to them and put them on a pedestal of superiority. At school dances, I would stand and watch them out of breath dancing every song away with the hottest boys from our school and the neighbouring schools while I stood at the outside of the grouping of dancers holding back tears for three hours at a time. After a few dances, I started calling my mother on the payphone to come and get me after only a few hours because I knew how things would go and the embarrassment and pity in their eyes was too much. Boys that I liked in my classes would tell me that they had feelings for my ultra thin friends and ask if I could put in a good word, completely overlooking me.\n\nIt felt and still feels like one\u2019s jean size could determine their worth and thus in comparison, I was worthless. When I would confide in them and tell them I felt like thin women were treated differently, they rolled their eyes and emphatically told me it was all about confidence \u2013 something as an only child I was born radiating but over the years had been stripped from me by experiences such as these.\n\nIf there was ever any doubt that I was not thin, my middle school crush (obsession) thought it was funny if every day as a running joke he would announce to the class that I was fat and ugly.

I remember a post here that was about triggering celebrities like Ariana Grande (in fact, she's actually the one I'd always look at, and envy her thinness), and while she's still thin (she gained some weight this year, but if you go back, you can kind of see her chest bones in 2016), she's technically healthy if you look it up (she has like a 20 BMI), and now I'm like looking for thinner people to look at.  Celebrities are really tiny and thinner than the average person, and I realized I've hit a low point if I'm looking for motivation through people thinner than her.\n\nI also had a friend come over, and I'm so messed up with ED, that whenever I see my peers' drivers' permits, I always look for their height and weight immediately, and later remember it to calculate their BMI to see where I fall, and to compare how fat I am to them.\n\nShe was 5 ft 3 and 110 pounds.  I'm 4 ft 9, and I was 110 pounds last June.  I'm 106.8 now, but that's just like 3 pounds less than her.  I'm still bigger, proportionally.\n\nAnother girl in my class had a 22.9 BMI, and a boy had a 17.3 BMI, and where do I fall?  23.2 BMI.  The biggest of all.  Fat.  Whale.\n\nI was contemplating lowering my goal weight of 86 lbs that I didn't reach to 80, and now I'm starting to think that 70 can't be too bad. \n\nI'm starting to think of getting my drivers' permit in the summer of 2020, instead of this year, because I want a smaller weight to be on there, so my friends won't see a big, embarrassing number.\n\n\nWow, my ED is getting in the way of me learning basic human skills for the adult world.  Where my weight is more important than learning a basic means of transportation.  Why drive when you can restrict, right?\n\nJust when I thought my forearms were looking thinner sideways, and weighed myself for true confirmation, why can't I be happy I was .2 pounds lighter than last time?  I just had to look at my chubby upper arms, that I'm starting to get ashamed of for building muscle as a girl.\n\nLike, yeah I'm working on it, and got an Apple Watch Series 3 with, hopefully more accurate calorie counts than my old Samsung Gear Fit S2 (it'd report burns of like 1,400 on school days, it was glitchy, I believe it counted too little), but now I'm skeptical of my new watch.  It reported 1,663 on a day I didn't work out at school, and while it's probably more accurate, looking at a TDEE calculator, and my activity levels, I can't help but feel it's overestimating (it said 1,915 on Friday, when I also worked out over an hour).\n\nI should be happy my parents got me an iPhone 10R (trade in of my old phone, we're not rich) for Christmas as well (which wasn't the original intent, they just wanted to reward my hard work with a watch that'd count calories better), but the app I use the most on there is the Activity app, and I pretty much only look at my calorie count there.  At first I felt like I didn't deserve to be spoiled like this, and now my parents didn't realize that they're only fueling my ED by giving me a device like this.\n\nIt's sad that I got my first iPhone, and the only thing I look at on there is my calorie count, and only stop if a friend texts me.  I'm hitting rock bottom.\n\nI don't know where I'm going with this, and sorry this is so long, but I guess I'm realizing that even though I eat more than some of you (1,300 calories a day, therefore, I thought I wasn't sick enough to go to recovery, and would get turned away by a nutritionist), that doesn't mean I don't have problems?\n\nI've started tracking calories again in Excel last week, and am planning to write \"You love yourself too much to stoop down this low\" on the pretzel bag my dad got for me, but when did you guys realize that you really needed help?\n\nThanks to anyone who made it to the end, sorry I couldn't provide a Tl;Dr.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I restricted my calories intake, started purging, could never stop thinking about food, etc. The typically horrible behaviours and thought patterns that come with ED stuff. The thing is, although I went to counselling a few times and spoke to my doctor about it, I was never diagnosed. I essentially recovered or am still recovering on my own.\n\nA year later, I am still confused how this all happen. Especially since I don\u2019t think I fit a specific criteria for any disorder. For example, I\u2019m not sure if I was anorexic because I wasn\u2019t very underweight and I wasn\u2019t at that weight for an extended time. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be considered bulimic because my binging and purging cycles were sometimes very frequent and then I\u2019d last weeks without them. It was very strange.\n\nNow, I\u2019m at a point where I\u2019m trying to continue to develop a healthy mindset around body image and food.

I don't know where else to turn. Here's the context of the situation:\n\nI was always the big kid growing up. I always felt fat, ugly and unworthy. Unworthy of love or kindness, a burden for people to even look at. When I past 200 pounds in high school, I thought I would have to end my life. I endured heavy, extreme bullying throughout school. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 with psychosis and an anxiety disorder. I went through a couple long term abusive relationships, and some very hard deaths in my life. \n\nI focused on my intellectual pursuits. I graduated high school with an advance diploma and honors. I went to the college of my choice with scholarships covering most of the cost. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in video game development and programming and a specialization in audio. During that time while I was working on my mind, I grew to 300 pounds.\n\nAfter graduation I entered the work force. I had a rough first year, but then things changed. I met the best, most loving, supportive friends I've ever had in my life. They have helped me identify toxic things in my life and get rid of them. They are always there when I need them, and I am always there for them. They are my ride or die people, and I am lucky to have them in my life.\n\nI got a job in my feild, and I have access to a mentorship through my job that let's me work towards my dream job. I am taking advantage and working hard at it. I met the love of my life, and he is the absolute world to me. I hope to marry him someday.\n\nSo now to the meat of the problem. In Novemember of 2017 I decided my mind was in a good place, and it was time to start working on my body. I changed my diet completely. I started going to the gym every morning and lifting weights with cardio. I did it. And I was really successful at it.\n\nI went from 300 pounds in 2017 to where I stand today in 2019 at 145 pounds. I am 5'6.\n\nMy mother and my boyfriend have told me to stop losing weight now, that I have done enough. I just saw my doctor and she told me she wants me to put on 10 pounds. The nurse told me if I kept it up I would look like skeleator soon. My friends commented this weekend on how they feel the need to feed me because I am looking too thin. My brother, who is in the air force and engaged in Olympic style weight lifting contests told me I am being too obsessive about my calorial intake.\n\nBut the thing is, I can't stop. I am only taking in 700 to 900 calories a day. And I am still looking for places to cut subconsciously. It's like I can't help it. I keep eating less and less, and it's so hard. My boyfriend has been trying to help me reintroduce grains and breads into my diet and I think I make myself sick mentally when I eat it because I can only take a few small bites before I declare myself full. I am terrified of any kind of weight gain at all. Even if it's a pound from just normal weight fluctuation, I panic. I beat myself up endlessly. I restrict even more. I work out longer at the gym. I try to limit my work outs to an hour. I tell myself it's unhealthy to have extended workouts. If I didn't have work and actively try to fight myself, I'd spend every waking moment in the gym.\n\nI told myself I'd rather die skinny then ever be fat again.\n\nBut the thing is I'm happy in general. I'm happy in my life. I don't want to hurt myself or the people around me. I am self aware enough to see this happening, but not strong enough to stop it. \n\nI see my therapist tomorrow. I go to regular sessions. Please, please, if you have anything to share at all, I just need something to hold onto. Something to help me understand. Even if you could help me start the conversation with my therapist tomorrow, cause this is so hard to talk about for me. I'm sorry for everything. ", "subreddit": "EatingDisorderHope"}

It only took a matter of minutes to flood the whole bathroom... every second I felt my anxiety rise more and more. Even once the water was off it took me hours to clean up and sanitize. Probably one of the worst emotional breakdowns in my life :( I ended up having to call my brother to unclog it before the family came home. He doesn't know about my ED didn't ask any questions.\n\nOn the bright side, this experience caused me to go 14 days b/p free.

We have had a few disagreements mainly because I felt like she didn't acknowledge the work I was putting in and when I had a couple of weeks where I maintained my weight (from having a period of losing most weeks) and I was happy with how I did, she wanted to remind me of my weight loss the previous weeks which I found incredibly negative and unnecessary. She also thought that reminding me that if I kept losing weight I wouldn't be able to drive anymore (while my BMI was over 17 and you cannot drive under a BMI of 15) which, again, was completely unnecessary. \n\nShe isn't all bad, and we have had some good sessions but overall I don't feel like I am benefiting from having therapy with her.

I shouldn't live.\nI hate myself because i don't think i should exist. Everybody else is beautiful/handsome etc. and i has every right to live.  I just don't think like that about myself. I'm a disgrace. A waste.\n\nMy story goes like this: I had a very complicated childhood. I'm not going to share what happened when i was a child so i fast forward to age 12. I was depressed girl with severe acne and started selfharming to let my pain out with cutting. Got bullied in school. I was put in childrens ward and got medication after medication. Got out from there. When i turned 18 i overdosed and ended up in adults psychward. Then i got sucked into psychward cycle: in, out, in, out, in, out etc. I was many years very suicidal. Weight kept creeping up and up as i was just thinking about dying and didn't care what i ate or didn't. Then i made myself a promise i should kill myself if my weight would go to 100kg(220,462 lb). When i was almost turning 19, my weight was 99,9kg(220,242) and i got a panic attack. Started losing weight by purging. Turning into bulimia for over two years. Sometimes weight was stable as my eating stabilised, and then it started spiraling again. I had sometimes 6 different medication pills at the same time, sometimes they got switched to new ones. First 20 kg fell of, 10 after that, 10 after that etc. I got a very dark years in 18-22 involving sexual assaults, drugs, alcohol and wrong company. Hanged out with a guy because in my sick mind i wanted him to kill me and i let him do anything to me because i hated myself so much. Now when i think about those times i go to a very dark place in my mind. Well back to the weight thing: When i was 22 i got sick of purging mostly what i ate and binging because of purging. I stopped purging and started restricting to 1600 and then 1200. Weight kept falling off and i ate less. Then i was 48kg and ready to kill myself again because i wasn't happy. Started to recover and eating again. I sometimes binge and sometimes i can eat like a \"normal person\". I still got some thoughts and rules towards food. I started recovering in december 2017. I started to panic when i started to gain weight. Ended up in hospital for a week from doing something that almost ruined my esophagus. Now over a year later i'm 58 kg and 173cm. I feel like a fat whale. I'm scared i end up obese again even when i know that i'm in a different situation now and i don't have any medication.\n\nTherapy, trauma-therapy, hitting, letting myself being sexually assaulted, being inside four walls 24/7 smoking, drugs, overdoses, cutting, eating, not eating, purging, binging, friends, family, sleeping, drawing or doing anything doesn't help. \n\nWill i ever be a decent humanbeing?

I want to recover on my own, without being constricted by a \"system.\" Don't get me wrong, I understand why they use the change plan (make sure minimums are met, nutrients needed are gained, etc.), but I really just want to eat \"normally\" (I use that term, and \"intuitively\" loosely, as I know hunger signals are disturbed by EDs) in my recovery. I found this article, which I felt applied to how I felt.\n\n [https://www.hummusapien.com/you-are-more-than-a-meal-plan/](https://www.hummusapien.com/you-are-more-than-a-meal-plan/)\n\nThe whole exchange thing has a \"food na\\*i\" vibe to it, to me.

The hangover. The walk of shame from the bed to the shower. I just loathe the feeling. I have sometimes been really good at weathering the discomfort of a compulsion to binge by bringing forth those feelings. It\u2019s a great practice in taking care of my future self and rejecting instant gratification. I am not bothered by feelings *during* the binge (and isn\u2019t that telling on its own?) but when I \u201ccome to\u201d the next day I am flooded.\n\n\nAnother idea is something I\u2019ve only begun to be inspired by, which is: what is on the other side of this urge, if I don\u2019t give in? I\u2019ve gotten through urges before, but I don\u2019t feel that I really have done it enough to prove to myself it\u2019s worth it. I have much more familiarity with following an urge, bingeing, and suffering after. I rationalize the choice so I can better live with myself. I try to learn from my mistakes. However, I realize there is a better way. I know, very intimately, what happens after a binge. Is it true that there is an equal and opposite thing to be felt when I don\u2019t binge? There is freedom, and pride, and self-efficacy. If bingeing numbs the bad feelings, does it also suppress the good feelings? There is truly only one way to find out.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

The positive thing is the constant presence of others has made me reign in my bad eating habits, both binging and restricting. I've been eating \"intuitively\" sort of, and went from around 170 to 155. That came as a surprise to me, but silver lining I guess.\n\nBut my roommates make me want to roll my eyes and die for many reasons.\n\nOne roomate is a guy. He's vegetarian, trying to go 100% vegan. He's talked to me before about how much healthier it is to do those things. I don't deny that at all. But two things to note here are that for one, idk how he can be on the \"I'm healthier than you\" high horse when he smokes far more than me (I'm actually down to 1-2 cigarettes a day!), is a very blatant alcoholic (he works in bars and drinks hard liquor every single night, then gets off work and keeps drinking straight hard liquor), and most of the vegetarian food he eats is junk food (chinese takeout, pizza, chips, snacks from gas stations). Second, I've tried to explain that I cannot start trying diets right now before I get back to therapy. Dieting only goes one way for me; straight into hard restricting and 72 hour fasts. I'd honestly love to try even just going vegetarian for a certain amount of days a week to help with my carbon footprint. But that's just not feasible right now mentally. But, ya know, hes pretty sure if I just meditate and do yoga and stay off my meds I'll be able to magically fix the BPD and comorbid issues of EDNOS and Major Depressive.\n\nThe second roomate is a girl. About my height and very over weight. She recently decided to start doing keto again to lose weight. She's also doing 1200 calories a day along with that. Super. I've seen both work for a lot of people. I mentioned doing it again (1200) and being more mindful of what I eat, but again that I'm not sure how great of an idea it is before I get back into therapy. She started harping about how \"at your size there is NO excuse to go below 1500 a day\"! Lol dude. Yeah, to lose weight I would need to. I'm still categorized as over weight by the BMI. My BMR according to most sites is 1500-1400. If I want to lose a pound a week, most sites recommend doing 1300-1200ish. I mean that's without exercise, but diet is like 99% of the impact on weight. Then when I mentioned when my ED was bad and I'd restrict to like 400-800 a day, she tried to hit me with that \"starvation mode\" bs.\n\nLol miss me with it, please. There's one thing I did when I dropped to 140 pounds; I didn't fucking eat and it fucking worked. Shocking.\n\nSo between Miss \"starvation mode\" and Mister \"I bet if you meditated more and did yoga you could go veg\" I'm fucking cackling.\n\nPlease, proceed to somehow know more than any medical professional I've ever seen. I love that. Yeah, I like yoga, meditation, exercise, eating actual healthy foods, and all that jazz. But can we not pretend like this stuff all comes magically fucking easy to every one, or that it's gonna start making me fucking shit joy filled rainbows. \n\nThis is why I don't talk to people when I start doing well. They STILL want to try and give me advice I didn't ask for when I've been fixing myself just fine.\n\n", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

You know that. You might be interested in doing it to:\n\n- start fresh\n\n- after a bad binge \n\n- maybe you were forced to eat out with friends/family and you ate what you didn\u2019t want to\n\n- you want to be the Cool Girl/Guy who looks like they eat whatever and \u201cstay\u201d/\u201cget\u201d skinny\n\n- maybe you do it for self harm purposes \n\nAs someone moving from BED to Bulimia, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve concluded.\n\n**APPEARANCE**\n\nI\u2019m not saying y\u2019all are like me, but I can be vain as fuck and put my appearance first. Here\u2019s what you get with purging. \n\n- Weight change. I know this is obviously the big thing. Obviously the scale goes down compared to before a purge. But you\u2019re losing a lot of water, stomach acid etc. which gives you this false sense that you\u2019re losing weight. In reality, most bulimics will maintain or (more likely) gain weight longterm even though you\u2019re \u201c\u201d\u201d\u201dcorrecting\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d your purge. Most bulimics are in the normal-overweight BMI and not formally diagnosed.\n\n- Teeth are fucked, thin, sensitive,  yellow and breath smells bad 24/7\n\n- The skin around your mouth will be ravaged. It\u2019ll be raw and you\u2019ll break out in pimples and weird texture from the stomach acid, snot, tears, vom, bile that comes up\n\n- Swollen glands make your cheeks v chipmunky... my face looks like an amorphous pancake compared to my body and BMI. Nothing will help accelerate your face getting back to normal. Not diuretics, changing water intake, electrolytes. It goes a little with each day you don\u2019t purge.\n\n- Bloodshot eyes, petechiae, burst capillaries around your facs. Nothing really helps it go away faster it just takes days.\n\n- Your hands will get scarred and tears and bleeding. \n\n- Heartburn and stomach pains 24/7. Gut flora is fucked to high heavens. Burps and farts (so much GAS goddamn) and lots of bloating. Surprise involuntary regurg is a bitch.\n\n- Nothing cuter than purging out of your nose or pissing your pants because of the strain of purging \ud83d\ude43. Splashback is also a very real thing... and so is the toilet blocking up biG time\n\n- Your throat is raw and painful, increased episodes of tonsilitis. \n\n**FEELINGS and FUNCTIONING**\n\n- I hear people purge because the purge itself gives them a high. Let me warn you, you may lose the purge high. I don\u2019t feel calm or good or pure like I used to after purging, everytime I near the end of a dissociative binge I absolutely hate and fear the purging after.\n\n- Some, like me, purge to gain back the loss of control that occurs with a binge or the guilt after eating anything at all. There is NOTHING that makes you feel as helpless and out of control than getting stuck in a b/p cycle. \n\n- After you purge food, your body is prepped and rearing to break down food, so with the food gone, your hunger level comes back to before or worse. I always thought I would have \u201cbetter control\u201d than to get stuck in a b/p cycle, but I swear it\u2019s a slippery slope that inevitably happens.\n\n- my gag reflex has been desensitised so my methods of purging become more and more aggressive. I\u2019m sure if i had a dental check up, I\u2019d have bruises down my throat\n\n- You\u2019ll lose electrolytes purging which means more fainting, lightheadedness, poorer concentration in work/study\n\n- Purging comes with increased risks of losing consciousness (and if you pass out at the toilet bowl, you could at least chip a tooth, at worse cause life-threatening damage) and choking whilst purging which is damn terrifying. \n\n**SOCIAL LIFE and FINANCES**\n\nDon\u2019t be blindsided by thinking purging will let you have a better social life- afterall most social activities involve food, right?\n\n- The fear of choking during the following purge will get you choosing foods you don\u2019t even like, so that it comes back up easier.\n\n- you will be the odd one who always runs to the bathroom afterwards or has to leave asap to purge. If you can\u2019t purge in time, the anxiety floods in and you (read: me) may get a bit mental\n\n- you will at some point have your purging session interrupted by someone. Whether it\u2019s by a stranger in a restaurant bathroom, a friend, a family member... that shit is mortifying and isolating.\n\n- You will get more and more desperate with where you purge. Maybe it starts out in the \u201csafety\u201d of your home... one thing leads to another and you\u2019re ready to purge at the vilest, Jackson-Pollock-y gas station toilet. Gross and unhygienic but you can\u2019t help yourself.\n\n- B/P cycles (read later in this post) are fucking EXPENSIVE. You are buying food that will not stay long enough to give you macronutrients or micronutrients. You are literally flushing money down the toilet. One thing that keeps me up at night, is the disgust I feel knowing I wasted so much food, resources, time, energy and money because of this disorder. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis is an elaboration on my response to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/afmp84/comment/ee0k53c), thanks u/HoldenCaulfield7 for encouraging me to make this a separate post. \n\nAt the end of the day, I can only share my warnings and experiences with y\u2019all. \n\nThe temporary \u201cgood\u201d is nothing compared to the harms it\u2019s given me, and I still feel shackled to this disorder daily. Please be careful y\u2019all and rethink starting purging \ud83d\udc9b\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEdit: I\u2019m reading all your comments btw.

I'm not very good at english since it's not my first language.\n\nToday i ate breakfast at 10, next meal was at 16. Guess who binged on lasagna, bread, icecream, cookies, beans, jam, cacao, chocolate, carrots, cucumber, cheese, sausages. Some of it i purged and c/s. I'm disgusting human being. I shouldn't live. I hate myself because i don't think i should exist. Everybody else is beautiful/handsome etc. and i has every right to live. I just don't think like that about myself. I'm a disgrace. A waste.\n\nMy story goes like this: I had a very complicated childhood. I'm not going to share what happened when i was a child so i fast forward to age 12. I was depressed girl with severe acne and started selfharming to let my pain out with cutting. Got bullied in school. I was put in childrens ward and got medication after medication. Got out from there. When i turned 18 i overdosed and ended up in adults psychward. Then i got sucked into psychward cycle: in, out, in, out, in, out etc. I was many years very suicidal. Weight kept creeping up and up as i was just thinking about dying and didn't care what i ate or didn't. Then i made myself a promise i should kill myself if my weight would go to 100kg(220,462 lb). When i was almost turning 19, my weight was 99,9kg(220,242) and i got a panic attack. Started losing weight by purging. Turning into bulimia for over two years. Sometimes weight was stable as my eating stabilised, and then it started spiraling again. I had sometimes 6 different medication pills at the same time, sometimes they got switched to new ones. First 20 kg fell of, 10 after that, 10 after that etc. I got a very dark years in 18-22 involving sexual assaults, drugs, alcohol and wrong company. Hanged out with a guy because in my sick mind i wanted him to kill me and i let him do anything to me because i hated myself so much. Now when i think about those times i go to a very dark place in my mind. Well back to the weight thing: When i was 22 i got sick of purging mostly what i ate and binging because of purging. I stopped purging and started restricting to 1600 and then 1200. Weight kept falling off and i ate less. Then i was 48kg and ready to kill myself again because i wasn't happy. \n\nStarted to recover and eating again. I sometimes binge and sometimes i can eat like a \"normal person\". I still got some thoughts and rules towards food. I started recovering in december 2017. I started to panic when i started to gain weight. Ended up in hospital for a week from doing something that almost ruined my esophagus. Now over a year later i'm 58 kg and 173cm. I feel like a fat whale. I'm scared i end up obese again even when i know that i'm in a different situation now and i don't have any medication.\n\nTherapy, trauma-therapy, hitting, letting myself being sexually assaulted, being inside four walls 24/7 smoking, drugs, overdoses, cutting, eating, not eating, purging, binging, friends, family, sleeping, drawing or doing anything doesn't help.\n\nWill i ever be a decent humanbeing?

Have you gotten to where you feel sicker being full than empty? Have you gotten to where you always feel like you're about to shit yourself? You don't want to.\n\nI've always had eating problems ever since my dad and his gf+her family would make fun of me and my weight when I was a kid. I wasn't fat at all, though a little pudgy being 9 years old about to hit puberty. My dad had body image issues himself, abusing steroids and constantly working out at the gym after my mom divorced him. Those got reflected onto me.\n\nThings got better though. It never developed into much more than just.... Not eating, I guess. By the time I moved in with my grandmother my freshman year of HS after being homeless, I was a skeleton. I got back on track... Until my grandmother started telling me she wanted me to GAIN weight. Having been skinny for so long, that was horrifying. I'm horrified of being fat, or gaining weight again.\n\nMy senior year was very stressful and I went from my normal 115-122 to 138. Once I moved to college I was determined to turn that around. Now by this time I knew about eating disorders. I knew I had struggled with eating problems all of my life, I just talked to my therapists about anxiety and depression instead, kept it to myself- I didn't need anyone telling me to gain weight! WTF? Who would do that? Doctors, apparently.\n\nFast forward to Freshman year of college. I had seen a picture someone took of me in class from High School and was mortified. I needed a change. I didn't work out anymore, having modelled and done track in high school I was pretty disappointed in myself. So I just... Ate less. Drank a coffee any time I was hungry.\n\nCome Spring I had lost 8 lbs but couldn't get past the 130 plateau (I still can't lol). In finding support forums at MPA, I found out others use laxatives to empty themselves out before weighing and preventing the food from being absorbed whenever I felt I ate too much. So I tried them. Every day for about a month, maybe two months. I don't really remember last spring too much. I got good grades though, whereas my first semester had landed me on academic probation. \n\nOh my God. I should have never done that. I began to shit myself on a near daily basis. I wore pads not for my periods but in case I was in class and couldn't get to the bathroom on time. And ever since then, I havent really been able to have normal poops. I have had diarrhea constantly since last Spring.\n\nI did go to a doctor, but my boyfriend (who also has eating problems and lives on meal replacement drinks) was in the room and I hadn't ever told him about the laxatives. We just kind of don't talk about our eating. It's a mutual acceptance but we do not encourage it with each other at all. We just understand it. My doctor was out and I saw her PA, who didn't order any tests- she just said my gut bacteria was out of line and gave me an antibiotic. That slightly improved things, slightly. But the nausea and bitter lingering taste it caused made me not eat at all while on it. So I took the first dose in whole but when I went back and she still didn't run any tests but gave me more, I just didn't take them. And here we are. I still need to go to the doctor. \n\nI wake up every morning with my stomach burning, the feeling of hunger no longer recognizable but replaced with a feeling of being sick to ones stomach, further exacerbated by the fact I'm not eating. It's a cycle in of itself. I can't eat for the first few hours I wake up because of that sickness, even though I know it's caused by not eating. The first thing I do each morning is go to the bathroom- it often looks like sand, or mud. Sometimes I don't digest food at all and leaves will come out whole and green. I digest food within a few hours when I know it's supposed to at least take a day. Just goes straight through.\n\nIts never ending and it's hard. I've lost taste for a lot of foods. What I once couldn't resist now makes me want to vomit. I was never a nauseous person. I used to be able to plow down a whole small pizza myself. Now I'm lucky to take a few bites. Feeling full makes me sick just as being empty does.\n\nDon't abuse laxatives. It can fuck up your life so very fast.", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

{"post_id": "agb42u", "created_utc": 1547574530, "title": "Interpretations of Brain Over Binge. I originally dismissed it as \"over simplified\", turns out it was right all along. The only thing missing was the lack of acknowledgement of how emotional eating fits into the equation.", "author": "earthwindfire1", "self_text": "**If you've truly eliminated food restriction and you're now adequately nourishing your body, any urge to binge is not coming from you, it's coming from the survival part of your brain still running the binge eating habit loop you created while you were once restricting food.**\n\n**The urge comes before the binge, focusing on stopping binge eating alone isn't dealing with the root cause, it's treating the symptom. You don't just want to stop binge eating, you want to stop getting the urge to binge eat so there's nothing to fight against.**\n\nSolution? Know that the urge is a false urge to eat and it's your survival brain still firing off that habit loop unnecessarily. The urge to binge is no longer needed for your survival because you're no longer restricting. Now what? Let the urge do it's thing in the background of your mind and burn itself out. You don't need to do anything except understand the urge isn't coming from you. It has nothing to do with you. \n\nBecause it's burned into your mind, it will resurface while trying to choose against it. That's normal so don't expect perfection buy do expect eventual completion if you continue to watch it burn out. \n\n**No Restrictions**\n\nAt first this can mean eat any and everything, but that's not necessarily for your body, it's to give you peace of mind around food. When your mind is at peace with food, you naturally make food choices that are beneficial to you because you're listening to your bodies feedback. This doesn't mean \"clean\" eating, it means feeling good physically &amp; mentally eating.  \n\n**Emotional Eating (Negative Emotions)**\n\nEmotions aren't causing the urge to binge eat, they latched onto the binge eating habit loop already running from the restriction. Why? Because it's the easiest thing available to you to change your state. When you do this over and over again, you've created a new habit loop of emotions + binge eating on top of the already established binge eating habit loop. \n\nNot everyone chooses food when they feel emotional. If the easier state change for someone is painting, they'll always result to painting to change their state. Another example is singing, if someone finds singing to be the easiest form of state change for them they will turn to that. Eating just so happened to be the easiest state change for you because you were already binge eating, which is pleasurable. \n\nFeeling your emotions alone doesn't tell you where the urge comes from. You still believe it's coming from you if you go down this route which is of course false. Thinking  urge comes from you, you're led to believe you lack the willpower to even stop yourself from having the urge. Knowing the urge has nothing to do with you almost relaxes you. \n\n**Emotional Eating (Positive/Neutral Emotions)**\n\nWhen you're without binge eating and emotional binge eating, you're left with eating. The enjoyment of food without negativity attached to it. Don't confuse mindless/anxiety eating while you're in a joyous/celebratory environment as normal. It's still a habit associated with the state change you learned from any form of binge eating. Most people have no idea what interacting with food while being in a positive or neutral state looks like. What I can say is guilt &amp; shame and anything other than satisfaction &amp; enjoyment are certainly not in the picture at all. \n\nIf you're wondering why you're still getting urges despite knowing the negative effects of binge eating, rest easy knowing it's the habit loop from the survival part of your brain still active, don't feel bad about it. The urges are not coming from you. \n\nPS: I would **highly highly** suggest you also watch some YouTube videos of people talking about their experience with brain over binge. If you don't read a single word of the book (I didn't) watch the videos below talking about the book, it'll still make sense to you, they sum up the importance parts really well and that's all you need. I feel for some maybe the entire book includes so much outside of the actual concept you can get overwhelmed, distracted or even confused while reading so it loses it's effectiveness. Of course feel free to read it if you want to. \n\nHere's the videos specifically that I watched:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wEinV_B-iQk\n\nhttps://youtu.be/H_HkrWIMI4w \n\nhttps://youtu.be/42ftGMVBFLQ\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2oIxt2ZUxmA\n\nhttps://youtu.be/1ErK27jFKHw\n\nhttps://youtu.be/uFuOEA0oKWY\n\n\nThey include their back story, their previous mindsets, how brain over binge resonates with them and also how and why it works. Their testimonials make you believe this approach to binge eating really works and it sure does if you listen attentively. This post is my own interpretations, I've expanded on what's being discussed in the videos &amp; brain over binge. \n\nEdit: The link below is the following post discussing why using mindfulness and emotional healing alone as methods to completely stop the urge to binge eating is unreliable, fragile and a continual process instead of a final procedure because you're treating the symptom not the root cause.

I\u2019m just so frustrated because now I\u2019ve gained back that 3 lbs and 3 additional. I\u2019ve been eating late after my roommates go to bed and haven\u2019t set foot in the gym. I keep telling myself tomorrow is another opportunity but I find an excuse to overeat again. I\u2019m disappointed my relationship with food has gotten back to this dark place once again and I\u2019m going to have to do damage control and potentially gain more.

Hopefully I don't come back to it often, but I'm feeling suffocated right now, and I don't want to talk to anyone IRL about it. \n\nI've never been formally diagnosed with an eating disorder (or been brave enough to talk to a professional about it), but I've had a fucked up relationship with my body, and often food, for probably going on 8 or 9 years now (20 years old currently). I've had several times where ED-type issues have popped up hard and then gone away. The last time was a year ago. I dieted myself down (I'm noticing here that I wanted to post my weight, but I feel like that's feeding into the pride I have in what I did, so I'm not going to do that) then had a horrible binge spree and jumped right back up. \n\nI've been applying to grad school and it's ridiculously time consuming and stressful, so all last semester I told myself to just bury my feelings about my body and food and push through; I would lose weight over break. So slowly over the past month my thoughts have been shifting to weight loss. I've always found with losing weight or trying to be healthy, I have to make myself go all in because it takes concentrated effort, but then it completely consumes my life. At this point I'm just trying to be more mindful of what I eat, but there's this daunting voice in my head saying that soon enough I'll be in a dark space and at the end of it all I'll go on a binge spree and lose any progress. I don't believe that I can do this in a healthy way.\n\nMy brother's wedding is in June, and I want so badly to look nice. To not have fat arms and to be radiant and beautiful. Have pictures of myself I want to look at. I went to the seamstress to get my dress tailored, and I asked to have it taken in, and she remarked that it only needed to be taken in a little. It hurt; I had felt really proud when I first got the dress and my sister said I should get it taken in. It's stupid expensive, and there may not even be time, but I want to have to have the dress taken in again closer to the wedding. \n\nMy way of \"turning off\" my issues is to do everything I can to avoid thinking about it. Looking at calorie counts scares me. I wear baggy clothes most days, so nothing feels tight or makes me worry about showing fat. I avoid mirrors and scales. I never EVER look at myself naked below my boobs. I can make these things a habit, and I don't feel it so much. It's like I have this knowledge all the time that I'm gross, but I put the volume of the painful feelings way down low. But lately I've been feeling so emotional about a lot of different things, and I can't ignore how much I don't like being in my own body. Even going back to school this week - I want to feel pretty and cute, but my clothes scare me. I've been KonMari-ing my stuff just a bit and trying to be an organized person, but step one is sorting clothing and the last thing I want to do is look through my clothes and all the shame I have at what I \"can't\" wear. People used to compliment my style all the time, but right now I can't imagine my clothes \"sparking joy\". \n\nI guess I kind of feel like this is the period before the storm. Part of me is hoping my motivation kicks in and I get skinny. The other part of me is afraid of fucking up this important time in my life by getting too self-invested. I've had an emotional dam break recently, and I don't know how to lock these feelings back up.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

This immediately reminded me of myself last year, as I was instructed to drink Ensures for weight restoration. I feel as though seeing these in the trash room could only mean that one of my residents has an ED, but I have no idea who it could be. I feel a degree of responsibility for this: what could I have done to prevent her ED? Is there anything I could do to help? I'm not close enough with my residents to really feel like I could approach anyone about it, but I'm worried that if I let it go, things could get worse, or my resident might feel alone. Or, am I blowing this out of proportion? \nAdditionally, this has brought back some really conflicting feelings for me. I feel a desire to restrict again, and noticed myself planning to restrict and looking at old pictures of myself and of other ideal pictures. Is this normal? I don't want this to lead to a relapse, because I've been doing so well in recovery. How can I not blame myself for the possibility of my resident having an ED?

Why it started, who knows never figured that out when I\u2019ve been in and out of therapy and what not. I\u2019m not invalidating anyone who hasn\u2019t suffered as long, I truly only envy you. I just feel like I need to connect to people who are in a similar spot, or someone who\u2019s beaten this after struggling for so long. My weight has been all over, high average, average and underweight. Right now I\u2019m at the low average end, and not actively in treatment. I was working with a therapist and dietician, I didn\u2019t like the therapist, loved my dietician but she stopped seeing me after my suicide attempt. So I\u2019ve been out of active recovery for like 8 months. Things are up and down for me. Mentally, not just ED wise, depression, anxiety, drinking too much have really been close to ruining my life.\n\nSo aside from my rant, if you\u2019ve beat ED after years, HOW!! I think a lot of my issues go hand in hand with my ED. I think that right now I feel like I wouldn\u2019t be taken seriously because I\u2019m not underweight, and I\u2019ve had several therapists in the past not take me seriously because I don\u2019t look like I\u2019m dying. I struggled mainly with purging, abusing laxatives, and restriction. Now it kinda loops between the three, mostly restriction. I have tachycardia, a couple of fake teeth, other severe dental damage and unstable vitals. I just don\u2019t feel like appearance wise I would be taken seriously and I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m only asking people who\u2019ve suffered long term because I\u2019m worried I\u2019m going to be 45 hiding purging from my prospective family..... Like when did you decide enough was enough? What helped? I don\u2019t know what to do. I constantly want to kill my self to not have to deal with these thoughts. I beat myself up for not taking my help more seriously when I had a really good team behind me. Now I\u2019m stuck, I\u2019ve been through so many therapists in my area I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. \n\nSorry for the rant, I just need advice from someone who\u2019s been through this because I just don\u2019t want to live like this at all anymore, and I\u2019m worried I\u2019m hitting a threshold and it will explode and I will end up dead.

I know it's stupid to worry about gaining weight and feeling miserable now that the milk is already spilled but I can't help it.. \n\nAnyway, here's what I ate today:\n\n1x carrot\n1x slice of dark bread (without anything on it)\n(i was so satisfied with that breakfast..)\n\n.. and for lunch/dinner I ate a small bowl of rice with mushrooms.. I threw half of it into the toilet before I started to eat so that I wouldn't even try to eat more than I had planned.. \n\nWell, obviously I did eat more than I had planned, otherwise I wouldn't have to write this now.\nThe binge started shortly after finishing my bowl.. out of nowhere! I wasn't even hungry. Somehow I barely ever am?? Sometimes I only eat a banana and an egg throughout the whole day and I won't get hungry.. I do feel weaker than before I started to.. obsess.. over food though...\nANYWAY, back to my binge..\n\nIt consisted of the following:\n1x whole chocolate Santa Claus\n1x bowl of greek yogurt with melted Milka chocolate and melted speculoos spread \n1x toffifee \n1x handful of sour gummy bears\n1x vegetarian cutlet filled with cheese and broccoli \n2x broccoli pastry rolls\n1x ben and jerry's ice-cream pot\n\nThat is more than I have eaten in like 2 or 3 weeks altogether in terms of calorie count..\nI want to never eat anything again after this. I feel as if all my efforts of losing weight have gone to waste. I feel as if my trousers that have gotten loose are skin tight now! \nThat can't possibly be reality though, right? \nI usually don't ever binge because I'm afraid of feeling like I do now but I did it and there's no going back. \nI will immediately return to my usual food intake tomorrow! There shouldn't actually be a difference in my weight right? Nothing noticeable at least, right? \nI need someone to tell me that I didn't just ruin months of controlling myself..! \nI might sound unreasonable or stupid but I am just so scared, I wish I would have been able to purge or that I would NOT have binged in the first place.. \nI simply feel like a failure. \nI wish I could eat as much as I like without gaining weight. \nOr I wish I wouldn't have to eat at all to live. \n", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

{"post_id": "ags6rj", "created_utc": 1547686622, "title": "The other side of Brain Over Binge: The emotional side.", "author": "earthwindfire1", "self_text": "Note: Lengthy post ahead (slightly long winded but I feel it's needed to fully flesh out the point being made). This is mainly for the nerds who want to understand the theory. \n\n**TL;DR - Using mindfulness techniques &amp; emotional healing alone as a way to combat binge eating is useful until a certain point or useful so long as you can stick to it. There's no finality with this method because you'll always find something else wrong with you, another trigger and a new mindfulness technique to try. If you're just waiting to be completely rid of every flaw, trigger and to be as mindful as a monk before you can finally be binge free then you'll be dealing with binge eating much longer than necessary. Mindfulness &amp; emotional healing are EXTREMELY beneficial but they alone do not provide a solution to get rid of the urge to binge because using that method the urge is believed to be coming from you which of course isn't true. The urge comes before the binge, focusing on stopping binge eating alone isn't dealing with the root cause, it's treating the symptom.**\n\n**You don't just want to stop binge eating, you want to stop getting the urge to binge eat so there's nothing to fight against.**\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen it comes to dealing with binge eating, there's most commonly 2 different ways to go about it. The brain over binge method which I've outlined in a previous post (https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/agb42u/interpretations_of_brain_over_binge_i_originally/?utm_source=reddit-android) or the emotional healing, understanding of various triggers and mindfulness approach. The majority of people deal with binge eating using the latter method. It made perfect sense to address the emotional turmoil which is constantly giving rise to the binges. Sadness, stress, anger, boredom, frustration, anxiety, loneliness, happiness (which was really mindless anxiety) etc. The way I interpreted it, any one of the outlined emotions triggered a binge. With that being the case the next step would be to outline the scenarios involving these emotions which would become triggers. Before I knew it my triggers were as long as my arm, countless triggers continually popping up. \n\nTo combat these emotional triggers I found mindfulness in various forms as the touted remedy. Becoming present, meditating, mindful eating, negotiating with the urge, sitting with your emotions and journalling. Each tool worked until they didn't work.. then they would work again then they wouldn't. Why? Because each tool is treating the symptom of binge eating and not the true root cause which is the urge to binge. Discovering one mindfulness technique after the other leaves you thinking there's always something better to find out there because there's always a different treatment for a symptom. More triggers you need to unearth in your mind that previously went unnoticed. What was once used to help understand your thought process leading up to a binge soon consumes your entire mind as you're confronted with the multitude of flaws you are unknowingly harbouring. The more you dig the more things you continue to find wrong with yourself, the more consumed you become by the insatiable need to totally rid yourself of all emotional trauma and triggers to hopefully attain a flawless state impermeable to binge eating. \n\nThe problem is there's always a trigger that goes unnoticed lurking around the corner, there's always a new mindfulness technique or paradigm shift you might discover that'll do a better job at stopping the binge eating. If you allow yourself to, you can truly get lost in the rabbit hole of searching for an enlightened state of binge-free-ness. As you're doing this you're actually forming another habit unbeknownst to you. The obsession with knowing all there is to know about binge eating trying to find that sacred paradigm shift that finally makes the penny drop. I went down this long road myself. Binge eating became this huge thing in my head that needed sophisticated psychology to break it down and bring understanding to my actions. **The idea of binge eating being a survival reaction triggered by restriction turned into a habit simply wasn't befitting enough of the answer I spent so long searching for which is why I dismissed Brain Over Binge repeatedly. Of course the full definition of binge eating I later came to know once I sat with the concept discussed in B.O.B was: a survival reaction triggered by restriction turned into a habit stuck on loop and somewhere down the line emotions latched onto that same habit for relief because it was the quickest way to change my current mental state.** Emotions latching on to the already established binge habit is was led me to believe my emotions were the main culprit of binge eating. That's not true.\n\nAll the mindfulness techniques, self awareness, meditation and healing of childhood trauma couldn't quite create the complete detachment in my mind from myself and the urge to binge. I still felt as though the urge was coming from me and it was my fault for having them. It turns out the mind was doing it's job creating urges to binge while it felt threatened by the restrictions I imposed on it. While using various mindfulness techniques I still felt a degree of control was necessary to manage the urges and my environment whereas being separated from the urge entirely seems almost insulting straightforward and quite effortless. Being separate from the urge reveals to you you're perfectly capable of dealing with your emotions without ever needing to contend with an urge to binge. \n\nIn hindsight, going down the route of self healing to combat binge eating was extremely beneficial. It taught me so much about the concept of mindfulness and being present in multiple aspects of life, how to understand my emotions and pat attention to my thoughts, how to eat Intuitively and listen to my bodies feedback signals, cognitive psychology and just a general acute self awareness I don't think I would've learned anywhere else had I not done this.\n\nKnowing the true root cause of binge eating is a major paradigm shift. As with all change don't be surprised if you still occasionally slip back into old patterns as you allow the whispers to dissolve. When building new habits you're literally rewiring your brain so give the process some grace and stick with it. From my experience and the experience of others I've read about, once you grasp the concept it drastically makes sense of everything you've been wondering about concerning binge eating. In time when it officially clicks and the penny drops, it might feel as though this huge part of your mind has been completely emptied out. It can be quite daunting and restless and leave you wondering what to fill the void with. This is an opportunity to finally live life without needing to look over your shoulder for a potential binge. Launch yourself into the things you enjoy doing. \n\nWhen all the noise is stripped away and you're reacquaint with a sound mind around food, you're left with eating. A completely harmless practice designed for our existence and pleasure. \n\nAlso just to touch on exercise, for me exercise is now seen as an activity to learn and practice new skills as opposed to a means to burn calories to lose weight. It so much more fun. I'll write a post on how to return back to healthy and achieve fitness goals post disorderd eating. My only hesitation in writing said post are the people who are desperate to lose weight at all cost will likely ignore everything else mentioned in these 2 posts and solely focus on weight loss and treat it like another diet without understanding all the theory on being healthy that comes before releasing weight healthily. This will of course end in another bout of disorderd eating and the cycle will continue. ", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I\u2019ve been off the charts anxious lately and do have a history of heart palpitations due to stress. ED-wise, I\u2019m underweight but not nearly to the extent that I used to be. I\u2019ve been restricting probably a bit too much but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m eating nothing. Haven\u2019t been purging, don\u2019t smoke, only had one drink last night and didn\u2019t even finish it because I felt nauseous. I\u2019ve been taking robitussin and sinus pills because my sinuses are fucked, but other than that my only meds are benzos and sleeping pills.\n\nI know everyone\u2019s knee jerk reaction will be \u201cgo to the doctor\u201d since yeah, that would probably be the smart thing to do. But for a variety of reasons that is absolutely not an option right now, so for the time being all I can do is ask Reddit and try to do whatever I can at home to keep things under control.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I need to sleep in order to process things and recover.  Sleep deprivation really hinders your mental health in general and that is not good for me right now.\n\n*TW*\nAlso this girl mentioned in group that she was so thin you could see her limph nodes (IDK how to spell it rn sry).  I don't need to hear stuff like that right now as it's triggering and not helpful.\n\nAlso table behaviors were happening at the table and my ED started to tell me maybe I should develop some, and I had to make a judgement that I did NOT want to because they look stupid.  Mean but it's true tbh.\n\nIt's all of those things plus at the company that does my supportive apartment there were staff offering me rides to and back and they would wait in the waiting room and honestly I am not comfortable with that bc it's such a big time commitment on their part.  And no they would not have been reimbursed for it.  I am so grateful they offered tho it means soooo much!\n\nI did meet my Individual ED therapist at The Emily Program today and I did let the IOP staff know at my intake that I would probably just stay in IOP until the waiting list cleared for a Individual Therapist.\n\nIt's just all these things are making it so that it's not sustainable, I have no wiggle room for anything with my time at all and I wanna continue therapy with outside general therapist too because I have a connection with her and she helped me a lot with self harm and with IOP I have no time.\n\nI did learn a lot while I was in IOP and I got a RD and a meal plan which I follow almost 100% (life does happen so I don't always get my tallies but I make sure to have *something*...I work at Walmart we sell Cheetos for $0.49 as a snack lol).  \n\nI am in a supportive apartment so I do have a Independent Living Skills (ILS) worker come for a few hours 4 days a week so I do have support that most people don't have access to.  They may not specialize in EDs but still you have to work with what you have.\n\nSo yea, that is where I am at right now.\n\n*TW: Numbers*\nBasically I am at a point where I eventually want to be totally Independent and eventually be a psychiatrist (I am going to school in the fall, Psychology program at a 2 yr college to start) so I really can't focus on wanting to be 60 lbs.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

And I think about food constantly throughout the day, trying to figure out which food combos will satisfy my body enough so I don't feel like absolute death, but also leave me at maintenance or a caloric deficit. Ya. Fun\n\nBut anyway, my GI team doesn't know any of this because i've kept all of that to myself. They've also recently proposed a G-tube to get me to gain weight. \n\nSo, at first I was opposed to it, since I thought I'd basically be forced to eat normally throughout the day and then be hooked up to a machine at night for tube feeding. This would obviously cause me to gain weight. But i've thought on it some more, and honestly? I could control how much is going into me still (ex: i could just do 1/2 of a package of the food, leaving me at maintenance), and i'd consistantly be getting an OK amount of nutrients. This would mean that I wouldn't have to constantly think \"oh, ONLY 10g of protein for 200 cal? Next item, please\" or \"omg I had way too much fucking salt yesterday now my weight is going to be fucked up. Time to eat the blandest of foods for several days\" and so on. \n\nWithout this mental strain I could probably apply myself to more meaningful tasks, and it'd give me some more freetime since i wouldn't have to \"waste\" it on eating.

Need advice on how to stop. \n\nRage at myself for struggling to attain balance. I\u2019m 20 years old, living alone at uni and I\u2019m able to write a dissertation in my third language but not know when it\u2019s normal to eat certain foods or amounts of food?\n\nIn 2012 I was stuck in hospital for months with a feeding tube recovering from severe anorexia and now seven years later I\u2019m still struggling to learn what balance is and not overeat. It\u2019s like no one ever warns you that recovery is more of a pendulum or yo-yo and not some constant uphill battle that gets easier. \n\nI\u2019m a healthy weight and I exercise regularly and for the most part I try to follow a loose meal guide made by a dietician just to keep me feeling safe and keep my anxiety at bay. I also see a psychologist regularly to talk about things that make me anxious. The first four years of recovery were somewhat more simple because I was in high school and living under my mother\u2019s roof: every day had definite, rigid structure (perfect for the OCD and anorexic need for control), I had a regular school lunch box and controlled sport. \n\nBut binge eating crept up on me. I first discovered comfort eating in 2014 (it was masked because I was still needing to gain a bit of weight) when my gran passed, and then was every now and then in my junior and senior years when my parents divorced and my mother and I were homeless for a while. The stress hit hard in the last two years when I had to work in 2017 and then again last year in my first year of uni. Completely new environments, time structures, people and food rules in both years. The overeating/comfort/binge eating became especially bad in 2017 when I gained a bit of extra weight with an abusive boyfriend. It wasn\u2019t that much (though it felt that way to me at the time) looking back and I\u2019ve stayed within a stable weight range the last three years in my adult body but I worked hard in 2018 to get back down gradually to a lower, healthier weight and busy myself with the things that kept me feeling safe: studying, friends, therapy and exercise. And it did help. But last year was also turbulent because my father attempted suicide violently in front of me, I escaped an attempted rape and my mother started dating an old family friend, who lived in my mother\u2019s house for the last six weeks over the holidays with his 23 year old daughter in the spare room. Which I would normally be thrilled with seeing as he makes her happy and he\u2019s a cool guy, except she\u2019s left me behind in her new happy family and admitted to excluding me from plans the last while because she doesn\u2019t know how to work me into this new life of hers with him. And yeah it hurts a bit and I don\u2019t know how to communicate with her without her defensively screaming at me or seek asylum in my father\u2019s unstable state. \n \nI\u2019m sure this emotional stuff has an impact on my subconscious anxiety and oral fixation and I know that the comfort eating doesn\u2019t happen every day and I\u2019m not necessarily finishing whole 2L tubs of ice cream and slabs of chocolate, but it\u2019s packets of chips and a chocolate bar or too big a bowl of pudding and nougat or whatever. I know that it\u2019s happening and that it\u2019s more than is healthy and this distresses me. Pig-out days or \u2018cheat days\u2019 as my gym-obsessed friend\u2019s would call them are normal but it\u2019s more sinister than that with me. Like I feel more anxious eating in front of people and feel more safe eating in my room alone when it comes to \u2018carby\u2019 food. As silly as it sounds I\u2019m worried that I spiral out of control and can never grasp onto a sense of stability with my life or my eating and I\u2019m so tired of the guilt, the confusion of not knowing what normal eating habits truly are and what is just Instagram model fa\u00e7ade and tired of hiding my comfort eating in plain sight of friends and family who would never suspect a thing. I am so so ashamed of myself and I feel pathetic and hopeless and I don\u2019t know what to do. Any advice or experience with any of this would be greatly appreciated. \n\n", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Other?\n\n\nFor those curious to my story:\n\nI\u2019ve always had unhealthy eating behavior, as far as I can remember back. I\u2019d eat very little during the day as I was uncomfortable eating in front of others, and then late at night when my family went to bed I would feast. I ballooned to around 285 pounds as a 16/17 year old (6\u20192 male) and then from 18-21, I lost just over 90 pounds. \n\nAs I grew into college age, my eating was not really an issue as I was now focused on vanity and women which easily kept me from doing it. Well, as the years went on my party lifestyle in college turned into a norm and before I knew it, I had a major issue with alcohol, drugs, and relationship jumping (sex).  I\u2019ve always been a highly functional user of whatever poison I picked during the day \u2014 no one around me would have ever guessed I was nothing more than a regular guy in his 20\u2019s focused on his career, finding someone to settle down with and start a family, who had major interest in fitness and nutrition. \n\nI\u2019m on the other side of the addictions that ran rampant in me for years now, day by day can still be a struggle but I\u2019m no longer under the thumb of an insanely strong pull to alcohol, drugs, and what I came to learn was a deeply rooted validation method for me with women via sex. \n\nSo now I\u2019m here. 31 years old, in a stable relationship, career in check \u2014 a bit strung out feeling on a daily basis but I can only assume that my body/brain is still in repair from all the booze and drugs. \n\nWith no vices to turn to, binge eating has come back with a vengeance except I\u2019m no longer uncomfortable eating in front of others. I eat like a normal person throughout most of my days, avoiding sweets as much as possible (they trigger binging for me). I workout hard, at least 5-6 days a week, as I genuinely enjoy it and I\u2019m also trying to lose about 10-15 pounds as I just feel better at that weight. Each day, around 9p \u2014 I get an insatiable hunger and drive to eat. And eat lots. Lately, I\u2019ve been slamming down probably around 3000 calories after a full days of eating, in probably around 15 minutes each time. I wake up not feeling well at all, not to mention the bowel issues it creates, telling myself enough is enough, only to find myself back at that point at 9p. This happens about 5 out of 7 days a week. My busy schedule and near daily fitness regiment is not enough to avoid gaining weight, which is especially frustrating. \n\nI\u2019ve been trying to learn about BED more, and have considered reading brain over binge. \n\nThat\u2019s my story.

She's been very depressed and she wanted us to break up. I didn't let her do it. We started seeing a psychologist, tried many techniques (CBT, IPT..) and it really helped her a lot. Not at first but eventually, when she accepted the treatments and started fighting. She got knowledge and awareness about her disorder. Also, her condition was mixed, food addiction and BED. Besides compulsive eating and bingeing, she also couldn't stop with certain types of food.  \n\n\nAfter she got better, she wanted to write a book about her condition(s), but more oriented on her tips how she overcame her disorders (she still struggles from time to time but compared to the previous, she lives much more healthy and happier life). Then I came to the idea (as I work in the IT industry) to make some kind of educative mobile app that will help others struggling with food addiction and BED.  \n\n\nWe asked students of psychology and their professors to help us on this project to fill the educative content, in form of 90 educative videos that will lead a person through a 3-month therapy.  \n\n\nThere is also a community section, like here on Reddit and some other features like statistics, motivation and helping others in need.  \n\n\nHonestly, you can call my post marketing, the app is new on the Google store, we published it just yesterday. I never used Reddit as a marketing tool, so besides naked marketing, this is also an invite to try something different (I hope it is). Maybe those educational videos will help you, maybe the community will. Or maybe it is a waste of time. We don't know so at least we would appreciate to give us a feedback :)   \n\n\nThere are probably still some bugs and we will update the app regularly so it should be better every day.  \n\n\nHere is the link to Google store: [deVicer mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=life.devicer.devicer)  \n\n\nHave a good day, wherever you are struggling with this disease!", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

Have I missed my chance to eat that much? I\u2019m just so frustrated and confused....", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I rarely get these episodes (like right now) of fearing what to eat.\n\nI think the anticipation of lunch is making me overthink this. I don't know why, but I feel like it has to be perfect. I just wanted to feel like I did something right for once.\n\nI don't know what to do. What's your guys' opinion? Should I eat the subway sandwich, breaking my no-meat streak and get temporary satisfaction? Or should I push through and get it? I am a little bit hungry (not very hungry) but I really wanted to complete a food challenge. I feel like it would help me feel like I'm more in control.\n\nSorry if this is a stupid post lol.

But today, i went to the person so graciously preparing my meal( which is a thing in refeeding programs, you typically get no access to making your own foods, maybe just some input as to what foods you may desire, under a strict caloric value of course) and i asked for a grilled cheese. and then when i was done that grilled cheese i asked for another, and then i asked for extra cheese and some ranch dressing to dip. this was yes very hard for me to do and i panicked a lot while eating and after, but i am extremely happy i did that. and hey, i'm here to tell the tale arent i!? so just do small shit like that and you will grow to realize that no, the foods arent going to hurt you, and that has helped me bigtime, all though being quite difficult to do at the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-don't obsess over things like the gain of fat on your body and bloating\n\nthis was the hardest time of recovery so far, and it still is every day. after the first week or abouts of having the excess of calories and food, your body will begin to reconstruct muscle and fat to a healthy amount, which means that you will start gaining and noticing that your legs and stomach and other main parts of your body will start to gain fat and muscle. this sent me into freak mode when i first noticed it as i woke up and saw my stomach and how it had a thin layer of fat that when i sat down, folded over. this sent me back into thinking \"how can i reverse this\" and \" its only the start of the whole recovery, this will get worse\" and so on. but its normal to have these things happen. the fat is coming back to the places its needed the most, typically around the organs and thighs and butt. so dont freak out, it will smooth out over time. Bloating is also a hard issue i have come to find myself at odds with, where my abdominal area will puff out to make me look fat, but its just your body getting used to the overshoot of calories and it being underfed for so long, getting used to eating a regular or big amount of food. as you progress, it will get less uncomfortable and most likely subside all together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n\\-do what YOU want, if you want something, have it\n\nin a way, refeeding is both heaven and hell. heaven because if you are like me, you enjoy food, just have been taught by the disorder to avoid it at all costs. so by being forced to eat, and eat a lot of high calorie foods and mass amounts, then you will realize what youre missing out on. and hell becasue once youre faced with these foods, you are typically going to feel guilt and panic an may even try to not eat at all. its happened to me many times, where after dinner, eating tons of food and feeling satisfied, ill be presented with ice cream and cookies or something of the sort and ill freak out, like ill go into a moment where ill think of any possible way to excuse myself and get out of that situation to avoid eating it. again, panic with surprise is normal. but you have to eat it none the less. why? because if you dont, who wins? who wins if you say you feel sick? or if you take a washroom break to wait it off. the disorder wins. so even if you only get a spoonful of ice cream down, its a spoonful towards recovery and youre the stronger person in the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Be okay with being hungry all the time, even if you are at the amount of calories you should be, eat more\n\none thing i learned just after starting refeeding a few weeks ago is that i am always really hungry. like extremely hungry, and i found myself eating insane amounts of food and half an hour later looking at the time to see when the next meal or snack is. i was concerned at first but after doing some digging, found that this  is NORMAL, so if you are hungry and dont know why even after a large helping of pasta or a massive burger, dont freak out. right now your body is still recovering, and depending how long you were affected in the disorder or how much weight you need to restore, will be for a while. so your body is trying to push all calories into fixing your organs and muscle tissue and parts of your body damaged or lost to anorexia. so now even though your stomach is saying \"please i cant take anymore\" to your brain as your digestive system is still digesting, your cells are working to fix things like your heart, and are using up all the nutrients, so they are sending your brain signals saying \" hey we have no more nutrients, eat something\". Therefore, you should eat. And dont stop until you've satisfied that hunger itch. even if it means eating right after a massive meal, go ahead. its not going to hurt. if anything, its important and good to give your body the building blocks it needs to ensure a quick and full physical recovery. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso these are just some things ive learned over the last short bit ive been in recovery. i know im far from being fully recovered and ive got a lot of weight to restore and a lot of work to do with overcoming anorexia, but im getting better every single day and hope to help anyone who has or is having the same struggles or issues i have had so far in recovery. best of luck and remember, you are in control :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

My ED originally developed in 8th grade, when I was in a relationship that was mentally and emotionally abusive for almost a year and a half. After I left that relationship, I went into therapy and noticed huge improvements with my ED. I've never considered myself fully recovered, as I still deal with disordered eating habits on a regular basis, but I am a lot better than where I used to be.\n\nOver the years, I have noticed whenever I get into relationships, I tend to revert into my old habits of my ED and feel that I cannot eat around my s/o, but I didn't end up having any long term relationships, so I felt that it was nothing to worry about.\n\nNow, as I college freshman, I am two months into a relationship with an amazing guy. He knows about my past relationship and how it influenced my ED, and that I still struggle with it a bit, and he truly tries to help as much as possible. The thing is, I haven't told him exactly how I'm feeling and everything that's happening. He just knows that I've had struggles with an ED, and that I'm still kind of nervous to eat around him.\n\nI figured this would get better with time, especially because I have never felt this much comfort with someone I've been in a relationship with. I typically avoid weighing myself, but yesterday, for some reason I decided to pull out the scale and see what I weighed. Turns out in the two months we've been talking, I've lost 10 pounds simply from not eating when I'm around him  (I typically weigh myself before I've eaten, but when I noticed I had lost 10 lbs, that was after eating normally for a day).\n\nI really do want to lose weight, (im at a healthy bmi but wouldn't mind slimming down a bit) but I also want to feel comfortable eating around my bf, because right now, when I go to visit him at his college for a weekend, I will barely eat anything the entire time.

I forgot how good it feels to not be bloated all the time from purging. When I binge, I have to live with the uncomfortable feeling of fullness, which makes me less inclined to binge as often.

My BMI when I started treatment was 17.6 and now I\u2019ve gained about 5/6lbs and it\u2019s around 18.6. I am just so frustrated. I had a couple of good recovery weeks but lately it\u2019s just been me skipping meals and trying to avoid food as much as possible. Things don\u2019t feel like they will ever change. Before I was diagnosed AN I was definitely dealing with BED for 3 or so years. I gained 40 lbs from binging. Before that, I was diagnosed with EDNOS, and was basically using all the symptoms/behaviors in the book (restricting, over exercising, purging, binging/emotional eating). My ED is basically all I know, and has taken up almost half of my life. I\u2019m in my late 20s now. I am just so terrified that I am going to go back to BED. I know that I am eating only a fraction of the calories I was ingesting when dealing with BED but I\u2019m still scared. There were a few weeks during the initial refeeding process that I was dealing with INSANE hunger and was eating like crazy. I know that that is normal, and now my hunger has kind of evened out, but I\u2019m just so scared to get out of control again or to gain more weight than I already have. Feeling utterly depressed today after eating around 2700 cal, most of it being junk food. So worried that I am just starting a trend and that tomorrow I\u2019m gonna keep overeating and that my weight is going to sky rocket.

{"post_id": "ai5rlm", "created_utc": 1548040421, "title": "*Reviews of Eating Disorder Recovery Resources*", "author": "PizzaIsASuperfood", "self_text": "**This Girl Audra**\n\nEven though she promotes veganism, Audra has a great attitude towards food and recovery. She breaks down what a relaxed mindset towards food is like and also presents the disordered mindset in an honest but lighthearted and effective way. She has been at both ends of the spectrum (over- and under-weight), so her channel focuses on both gaining and losing weight. She is not the most scientific, but in terms of speaking in a positive, approachable, motivational way that *sticks*, she's one of the best. She has also recently returned to Youtube after a year's hiatus. \n\nOne video to check out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrjrO86QjNU\n\nOffers coaching: yes \n\n**Kayla Rose Kotecki**\n\nOne of the best; recovered in body, mind, and spirit, and yet humble enough to know that recovery and self-development is a long and ongoing process. She also has a knack for explaining things in a relatable, pleasant, non-gimmicky and effective way, even if the ideas in and of themselves may not be super revolutionary. She is also one of the vloggers who shares the physical aspects of her recovery and weight fluctuations. I would recommend her for all audiences, and she may particularly resonate with those who have any history of competitive bodybuilding, bikini competing, or chronic dieting. \n\nOne video to check out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4i6S5rz6DoI\n\nOffers coaching: yes\n\n**Tabitha Farrar**\n\nIf you need a tough-love, blunt instrument to hammer anti-ED thoughts into your head, Tabs is your best bet. Her channel is frequently (at times daily) updated with short, dressed-down clips addressing a number of day-to-day anxieties that somebody may have about eating disorder recovery in a Q&amp;A format. She is excellent for those who have a strong OCD component to their disordered eating, and also breaks down certain aspects of the mindset (especially anxiety-related issues) about eating disorder recovery. Her approach is food-first, and not as emotions-based. She is straightforward, honest, and can be compassionate, funny and sarcastic, but at times also quite vitriolic, expressing rage towards providers and recovery centers' misguided attempts to treat patients with eating disorders, which can be problematic because it may make it more difficult for those trying to work with their ED teams to know who to trust and who to believe. She is recovered, both physically, mentally, attitudinally, and also a more mature voice in the recovery community. She also has a podcast on a number of interesting topics. \n\nOne video to check out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3GKseSR9k\n\nOffers coaching: yes  \n\n**Alice Olivia**\n\nShe may be physically recovered, but I have doubts as to whether she is emotionally or mentally recovered. Things like using the phrase \"unlimited calories,\" having videos where she shows her body as \"proof\" that she is thin, several too many \"what I eat in a day\" videos gives me this impression. She also happens to be vegan, which may be a pro or con to some. She comes off as a bit younger or less emotionally mature compared to other recovery Youtubers, as she is image-conscious. She updates frequently, and the main draw to her channel is that she has a few videos that clearly show her physical process of recovery, which may be invaluable to people anxious about this aspect of recovery. \n\nOne video to check out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2AYNqhXAOg\n\nOffers coaching: no, but has a Patreon program\n\n**A Case of the Jills**\n\nA great resource for overexercise and endurance athletes struggling with disordered eating and hypothalamic amenorrhea. She has a very straightforward but compassionate and introspective way of talking about her challenges, with a bit of self-deprecating humor. Most recovery Youtubers work hard at what they do, but I think Jill is the embodiment of somebody who works very hard to deliver quality, well-researched content on her channel. She is also older and more mature. \n\nOne video to check out:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw_5O0q7jX8 \n\nOffers coaching: yes, and she has taken extra courses to get certified in coaching \n \n**Follow the Intuition (Elisa Oras)**\n\nI am fairly neutral towards Elisa's videos. I think she essentially puts Your Eatopia (The ED Institute) into video format in her channel without substantial new content, although she does share her own experience with disordered eating, bulimia and fruitatarianism without being extremely underweight at any point. She is a positive and even-keeled presence, and I do believe that she is recovered. She also is one of the more interactive vloggers, and has done a number of collaborative interviews with other recovery vloggers, which is kind of neat. \n\nOne video to check out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VnEt6KbCtM \n\nOffers coaching: yes\n\n**Ladle by Ladle (Rachel Resnick)**\n\nA bit sorority-girl in her mannerisms; very bubbly and conversational; she's got the gift of gab. Much of the content on her channel seems to be based on Minnie Maud, so it's not revolutionary or anything, but she is very positive, honest, and might have a few thoughts and phrases that might stand out to those working through recovery, so definitely worth reviewing. Of note, there are many depictions of her eating on this channel. \n\nOne video to check out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRa_w2_2sro\n\nOffers coaching: not that I am aware of \n\n**What Mia Did Next**\n\nThe main peeve I have with her is that the titles and thumbnails of her videos are dramatic-sounding and somewhat clickbaity, if not almost tabloid-esque: in all caps: \"I don't want to talk about this\", \"Questions I never thought I'd answer\", \"Does Bella Hadid Have a Problem?\" That said, she is a sweet person and the content of her videos are honest, wholesome, and well-considered. She would resonate with both a younger and more mature crowd, as she is 30 or older. She also has her own internet forum.\n\nOne video to check out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wVa0nfH4Tk\n\nOffers coaching: yes\n\n**Lydia the Lifestyle Coach**\n\nShe seems extremely aggressive and gimmicky, with an oddly animated way of speaking, which unfortunately obfuscates her core mission and may leave viewers feeling emotionally disconnected from her message. I personally cannot recommend her videos.\n\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxnTaOjFwBjlF6QxcwsD2_g\n\nOffers coaching: yes, that is part of her title\n\n\n**Vloggers who are in the process of recovery:**\n\n**Sarah Recovery**\n\nShe may be younger than the average recovery vlogger, but she is strikingly mature, intelligent, introspective, and honest in documenting her process of recovery. Especially appreciate that her videos do not have a bunch of \"polish\" and post-processing. She does portray the physical aspects of her weight changes in recovery, but there\u2019s much more depth to her videos. Highly recommend. \n\nOne video to check out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5s1fUT0qXc\n\n**Megsy Recovery**\n\nI think there is a difference between folks who have required inpatient level of care for their eating disorders and folks who fall more on the chronic yo-yo dieting spectrum. Meg is in the former category, and she is in the process of recovery. Her channel is valuable because she is an example of somebody who reflects on the chronic nature of eating disorders and also documents the process of recovery as she is going through it. Because of this, she may be helpful for those at similar stages in recovery as her to follow along - she articulately discusses habits and mindsets that she has encountered. She may be more difficult to relate to for those who are further along in recovery, or whose eating disorders were not necessarily pure anorexia or those that required inpatient. Her videos do frequently go through her activities and what she eats in a day, which some may enjoy, but some may find to be a negative aspect of her channel. Again, she is not fully recovered and does not present herself as being so. \n\nOne video to check out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54TJJf0dBe0\n\n**Hanne Arts**\n\nShe seems like a very sweet person and shares her struggles, which has included inpatient hospitalization for her anorexia. She has a calm demeanor. I imagine she would be more helpful for those earlier on in their recovery process. I did not find her videos extremely informative but rather more helpful in the sense of just not feeling so alone in this process, although she does present a good number of her videos in Q&amp;A format and answers mostly according to Minnie Maud-esque guidelines. She also does a number of food-related videos and portrayals, which again may simply be indicative of the extent of her recovery thus far. \n\nOne video to check out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE_tX6gXFKs\n\n**Daphne Fischer**\n\nBreezy, emotional way of talking combined with frequent hair touching that sometimes comes off as a bit like posturing, but overall is very friendly, positive, real about her struggles. She seems to have a good grasp on the earlier stages of recovery, is thoroughly documenting her process, and is a good addition to the arsenal of ED recovery media. \n\nOne video to check out:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlYodTJHVsI\n\n**Kelly U**\n\nAnother vlogger who reflects on her long history of yo-yo dieting, problematic eating behaviors, and body image. She seems to have gone through a long period of grappling with her issues and is not yet recovered, though she seems to have made several attempts to recover. Not necessarily deeply insightful, and when looking over her channel, it seems that she is stewing in this quasi-recovery, back-and-forth, intuitive-eating-but-maybe-not place. It could be confusing to viewers because I do not think she models a more \"determined,\" \"I'm going to get through it\" version of recovery. However, some of her videos may be helpful to those who are earlier on in their recovery. Also of note, she is one of the few WoC in the ED recovery vlogger community. \n\nOne video to check out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=car4xyyEl9M\n\n\n**Vloggers who also like to vlog on other lifestyle-related things, but have some ED-related videos:**\n\n**Marissa Kai**\n\nShe does many lifestyle-related videos, but does have a few reflections on how she recovered from her eating disorder. She talks in a frank manner and seems friendly, steady, has a reassuring and kind tone. Of note, she is vegan and does have a fair number of food-related videos, which does cast some doubt as to how recovered she is, but the ED recovery videos she has are pretty good. \n\nBest videos to check out:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A06uaDdpblw\n\nOffers coaching: no \n\n**Maddy Moon**\n\nIn general she seems to talk about new-age-y things, like feminine and masculine energy, how to be a female internet freelancer/businesswoman/coach, but she does have a few good and original videos on how to mentally reframe weight gain and body image. She has a particular way of speaking that at times sounds extremely motivational and energizing, but could also come off as a little artificial. \n\nBest videos to check out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhPIFBg6vtM\n\nOffers coaching: yes\n\n**Bhavsplate**\n\nShe likes to vlog about clothing and skincare, but also has a few ED recovery videos that are very sincere about her recovery process. She, too, documents the physical aspects of her recovery, which may be helpful to some viewers. It is unclear if she is entirely recovered, and she is vegan, but in terms of attitude, warmth, and supportiveness, she is absolutely an asset to the recovery channel community and is upfront about where she is at (which is different than presenting oneself as fully recovered while showing hints of disordered attitudes). She is also notably one of the few WoC recovery vloggers. \n\nBest videos to check out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mMkVRKNbog\n\nOffers coaching: no\n\n**Autumn Brianne**\n\nAn ex-fashion model, Autumn seems to focus on new-age-y, spiritual issues, as well as clothing/lifestyle finds, and vlogs from sunny Hawaii. She has a few valuable reflections on body changes in eating disorder recovery, and emanates positivity. \n\nOne video to check out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK00eFdge2w\n\nOffers coaching: yes\n\n\n**Podcasts**\n\n\n**Isabelle Foxen Duke**\n\nShe is one of the earlier, perhaps even \"OG\" thought leaders on the notion of eating without restriction, and that is the crux of what she brings to the table-- this idea of getting rid of all restrictions and attempts to control food, which is more sophisticated and a step beyond intuitive eating. She gives concrete examples that are very helpful and she really \"gets\" what she's talking about. However, I find that she has a rather exaggerated, aggressive demeanor. I know that struggling with disordered eating can be a very emotional thing for people, but there is quite a bit of aggression in the way she talks that viewers may find very off-putting and unhelpful towards recovery. \n\nWebsite: https://isabelfoxenduke.com/\n\nOffers coaching: yes \n \n**The F-It Diet (Caroline Dooner)**\n\nHer blog and podcasts are good, but with one drawback - I find her style overly casual to the point that she will talk about how she is \"yawning\" or exhausted while making her podcast. Perhaps it is intended to communicate how chill and how \"f-it\" she is, but it comes off instead as like she doesn't really care about the podcast, which is likely not true based on the quality of her content elsewhere. She is also a talented singer. She sounds well-recovered, although she also does seem to be into weird-ish alternative health-y, diet-y things still, such as a recent \"parasite challenge.\"\n\nRecent podcast to check out: https://thefuckitdiet.com/isnt-this-irresponsible/\n\nOffers coaching: no, but she has a course available\n \n**The Eating Disorders Recovery Podcast by Janean Anderson PhD**\n\nIf you are a psychology major, mental health clinician, or physician, you may find this podcast of interest, which focuses on interviews with clinicians about recent research on eating disorders. They cover a range of important and current topics that may deepen your understanding on the psychiatric and psychological aspects of eating disorders. \n\nPodcast link: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-eating-disorder-recovery-podcast/id1087275550?mt=2\n\n\n**Seven Health by Chris Sandel, naturopath**\n\nChris Sandel does these in-depth, 30-minute to hour-long podcasts on a number of topics that might be of interest to people recovering from eating disorders, including studies on metabolic rate, over- and under-eating, starvation, and more \u201cnebulous\u201d symptoms related to poor or under-nutrition such as insomnia and frequent urination. He puts a lot of effort into his organized, clear podcast; it\u2019s almost as if he has already written entire papers or essays that he then reads from in his podcast-- that is how seamless they are!\n\nPodcast link: http://www.seven-health.com/category/podcast/\n\nOffers coaching: yes\n\n**Real Life RD (Robyn Nohling RD, NP)**\n\nValuable because Robyn is has some medical background on top of her dietetics background, and also takes a more understanding stance towards medical professionals, which may overall be helpful in those trying to recover rather than the stance that \"doctors just don't get it\". She is a calm presence who explains concepts clearly. She has not been super active on Youtube recently, but she still has a good number of videos that focus mostly on amenorrhea and ways of eating; her intended audience probably leans closer towards chronic dieters and mildly disordered eating rather than severe inpatient-level eating disorder patients. \n\nOne video to check out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fE4oYMBoII\n\nOffers coaching: yes, but there is a waitlist\n\n**Jennifer Gaudiani, MD (Gaudiani Clinic)**\n\nDr. Gaudiani is an internist who has had over a decade of experience working with eating-disordered individuals suffering from the severe medical consequences of eating disorders. She has this way of talking extremely slowly on patient-oriented podcasts (she does talk at a normal pace when speaking to an audience of clinicians) and if you listen to her interviews across multiple podcasts, you find that she basically says the same thing time and time again. However, the Gaudiani Clinic Youtube channel has a trove of \"Medical Minute\" videos, which are one-minute-long videos that explain various aspects of the medical consequences of eating disorders intended for lay audiences, which is invaluable. She has also recently published a book, titled Sick Enough: A Guide to the Medical Complications of Eating Disorders, which has a social justice-oriented bent and is aimed at both lay and professional audiences. \n\nOne video to check out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gbcVe1Fcfk\n\nLink to clinic website: http://www.gaudianiclinic.com/ \n \n**No Period, Now What? (Nicola Rinaldi PhD)**\n\nShe is not an ED recovery coach, but Nicola Rinaldi PhD focuses on recovery from hypothalamic amenorrhea, which many eating disordered-women suffer from. She is thorough and systematic in the research she reviews, very knowledgeable, kind and supportive. She is the author of the book \u201cNo Period, Now What?\u201d and I would consider her an essential resource in women trying to regain their periods, bone density, and also those who are hoping to conceive. She moderates a Facebook group. \n\nOffers coaching: yes\n\nLink to book: https://www.noperiodnowwhat.com/", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I explained what I was doing, how I had gained so much weight binging, the doctor basically said she supported whatever helped me eat healthy and then suggested that she could prescribe me Topamax for my migraines which might have the added benefit of suppressing my appetite and urge to binge. I ultimately said no because I only get migraines 1 or 2 times a month and didn't want to take a pill daily. \n\n\nBut then...THEN she asks me if I've read about fat acceptance, suggests I read the book Land Whale and tells me I don't have to lose weight, I can be perfectly healthy at the weight I'm at.

I\u2019m looking for a job and want to move out so I can control my lifestyle more. My parents stress me out (god bless them) and looking for a job does too, and the junk keeps coming every time they go to the grocery store. Vegan/gluten free chips, bread, ice cream... all huge triggers for me. I should be able to resist it, but I fucking can\u2019t. I\u2019m so alone and it scares the shit out of me. I\u2019m stuck with my childhood habits in my childhood home. \n\nI also have misophonia (hatred of sound, in my case eating noises when people smack their lips when they eat) which might be somehow related to me just feeling that eating is shameful and gross.

It\u2019s really bothersome when families relate through food above everything else. I think they\u2019re aware it bothers me but I just get so stressed when they talk about these foods I\u2019d rather not have around. \n\nI\u2019m in therapy and considering medication again. This situation is not tolerable and I need to figure out how to get through it until I find a job and move out. I would ask my dad to adjust his chewing but any time I ask my family to be mindful because it bothers me they take it really personally. And I don\u2019t want to shame their food habits or even really bring up this stuff because I think my mom feels I still blame her for passing on an unhealthy attitude towards food.. So ideally I wouldn\u2019t have to bring this up, but at the same time they should be considerate enough to listen if I do, right? \n\nAnyways thought I\u2019d reach out for advice or support. I know there aren\u2019t easy answers I just thought I\u2019d see if sharing would make me feel better. ", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

My first memory is of binge eating, and I came to find that over the years, I was more predisposed to binge eating as my stomach would \u201crandomly\u201d get upset, causing me to eat whenever I could manage it. Just now - at the age of 26 - I am learning what my stomach issues may be and are finding a solution. \n\nAs a teen/young adult, I knew food would make my stomach volatile - and stress more so. Knowing such, I found it much easier to embrace disordered eating patterns as it was less likely to upset my tummy if I wasn\u2019t eating or binge eating. I think this was a significant factor in my developing an ED, as when things got stressful I already had a poor relationship with food. \n\nAnybody else have this experience? \n\n((Disclaimer: of course I know EDs come from a plethora of places- genetic predisposition, mood/anxiety disorders like PTSD, environmental factors, etc.)) ", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

This friend cooks with large amounts of butter and bacon fat. Everything he cooks has either one or both in it.

And then he gets upset that I don't eat and worries about me again.\n\nAnd the cycle just continues. It makes me feel shitty that I make him worried but it also pisses me off that he just expects me to eat all the carbs that he's just soaked in butter and fat even though I've told him repeatedly I'd eat more if he cooked it differently.\n\nThe few times I was able to cook, he said it was okay, and after the meal, he would just flat out told me that it would've been better with butter.\n\nNo one other than my boyfriend knows about my ED, and I don't want this friend to know about it because I really feel like he just wouldn't understand it at all.\n\nI have another housing option with another group of friends, but he and our mutual friends have already asked me twice and I'd feel really bad if I took that offer without talking to them first.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on what to say or how to handle this situation?

Questions", "author": "roseology", "self_text": "A somewhat lengthy but necessary summation; I started a diet last May (2018) to lose weight, and it worked -- I lost *around* 40lb in about 5-6 months. However, at one point I realized it was getting too unhealthy (I had the goal to *always* lose a pound a week, more if possible, but it was normally just a 1-2lbs) and would severely to moderately under-eat on days following a \"binge\" (2,000-3,000 calories) in order to properly compensate and see weekly weight loss. I finally managed to break away from the \"diet\" mindset after about a month or two of trying, landing me in a really screwed up sense of \"recovery\" these past two months. I now have a bunch of disordered habits and thoughts on food, which is a problem perpetuated, if not greatly fueled by, my preexisting anxiety and OCD. I am slowly trying to deal with that, but believe I definitely need professional counseling (which I am already in pursuit of and will have my first appointment to get assessed at a local ED clinic soon). However, I wanted to seek the guidance and opinions of those with similar experiences in order to gauge my situation more clearly.\n\nYou see, another big problem of mine is the extreme bouts of fatigue, irritation, disturbed sleep, and worst of all, extreme hunger that I feel. The physical effects have been predominant for months and they're really starting to get to me. I have this idea that I shouldn't have to gain back twenty pounds of dieting progress because I screwed up at one point and took it too far, so I am trying to avoid just giving in and eating everything in sight. I don't even crave specific foods, I just want *everything* and *anything*. As of now, my diet is very wholesome as my OCD/anxiety made me a really clean eater (I fill up on fruits, veggies, lean protein, and whole grains, with the occasional carefully measured and accounted for dessert/treat). I am, essentially, trying to loophole progress here.\n\nNow, I have some questions, and I'd greatly appreciate any help with them :)\n\n1. Can I end the extreme hunger by still eating my calculated maintenance but just eating at regular and consistent intervals that tells my body I'm not actually in an environment that is starving me?\n2. Almost every time I eat I feel my stomach expand in a very odd fashion. It's not so much as a lot of outside, visible bloating of my stomach that I can see; it feels very internal, like my actual stomach is expanding weirdly and it encourages me to manually push out my stomach as a way to compensate. What is this? What does it mean? Is it normal?\n3. Is working out in this state a bad idea? I wanted to build muscle in order to negate eating a regular amount but after a few lifts I start feeling very very sick, like I could vomit (I don't, however). Could trying to build muscle right now actually hurt me more in the long run? Or should I push through it?\n4. Could have losing weight too fast have caused all this and my body is just going through an adjustment period?\n5. Do I HAVE to gain weight in order for all my functions to return to normal?\n6. Has anyone else ever gotten the feeling where they feel super physically irritated, like their body is starving for energy and they could snap at any second for it?\n7. Sometimes, after eating a larger meal, I get super super tired, and my eyes have actually ached with tiredness before from it. What does that mean?\n8. Sometimes after eating I also start feeling kind of sick and nauseous but it's not too frequent that I'd say it is a majority of the time. Just sometimes, really. Anyone else have this? Know what this is?\n9. Anyone else have really bad, can barely read or focus, brain fog?\n10. Does under-eating ever seriously hurt the kidneys?\n11. What types of foods might be most conducive in fighting the extreme hunger? I fear most calorie dense things as they just mean I will have less time throughout the day to eat again (if I use up all my calories too fast, that is).\n12. If I actually lost a lot of muscle and hurt my metabolism in other ways, should I still aim for what is my calculated maintenance or should my basal be enough? I feel guilty eating until 1,550 when I could just not and the hunger isn't too bad.  \n\nIf I can elaborate or any question to make it easier to understand and answer, please ask and I will do my best! Any and all constructive responses are welcomed, thank you if you read all of that!\n\n(I am an almost 5'4, around 118lbs, 18 year old female. I am to eat 1,550 calories a day but half the time fall short.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

I've been binge eating for years but I never noticed until recently. I've always had to cut weight, lots of weight in short times for weigh-ins. The most recent weight cut I had to do was this summer, I cut from 113lbs to 98lbs in a week. During that weight cut I would only eat a salad about every other day, and drink a ton of water. All I did was run, starve and sit in a hot car to lose the weight. It killed me. Cutting weight has always been against my will and controlled by my parents and I honestly always hated wrestling, and tried quitting for years. In the fall, winter, and spring I would wrestle about every 2 weeks (this was before highschool) I would binge for a week and quickly stop and eat little to no food to make weight the next week. That is what I did for many years. I ate while I could, and ate a lot.\n\nDuring high school wrestling, the seasons would last 3-4 months (depending on if you qualify for districts or state) I qualified for districts every year for the \"boys\" but never qualified for state, after boys state, since womens wrestling is getting bigger, they had womens state and I had to cut again for that (I won it). I wrestled the 106lbs varsity spot the whole year. Keeping 6-7 lbs off doesnt sound that hard, but I already don't weigh a lot, and having periods make it so much harder to keep my weight down. The problem is, I had to weigh in and wrestle 2-3 days a week. I couldn't do it. I would binge eat, and then make myself puke to make weight. After the wrestling season was over, the binging and puking never stopped. I even wrestled less now, only in the winter, and some freestyle in the summer. The most recent weight cut to 98lbs destroyed me. I got so sick from it. I haven't wrestled since that tournament. I fought with my parents about quitting until the high school season started. The forced me to go to practice but I never showed up.\n\nI thought quitting would make the binge eating go away, because I no longer had to worry about the next time I would be hungery and weak. But it never went away. It is so much worse now. I binge everyday. I hate myself everytime I binge. Sometimes I will eat whole bags of chips, icecream, donuts, anything junk food. My whole paychecks go towards my binge eating. The bad part is, I'm lactose intolerant, and celiac. The foods I binge hurt me. Sometimes ill puke from pain or other times I will make myself puke. I haven't gained a lot of weight, I only weigh about 116 now. But it is mostly fat, I lost a lot of muscle. People say I don't look fat but I feel fat. How do I stop this? I also have to take pills for depression, and anxiety, idk if that has anything to do with it. I don't like talking about things like this but I think it is serious now. I want to stop but I can't. Please help. Sorry for writing a whole book.\n\nPs. Once I turned 18 I started smoking to hopefully help with my binges. It helped for a little bit, but stopped working for me. I still smoke now :P Can't stop that either. ", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

She's been very depressed and she wanted us to break up. I didn't let her do it. We started seeing a psychologist, tried many techniques (CBT, IPT..) and it really helped her a lot. Not at first but eventually, when she accepted the treatments and started fighting. She got knowledge and awareness about her disorder. Also, her condition was mixed, food addiction and BED. Besides compulsive eating and bingeing, she also couldn't stop with certain types of food.\n\nAfter she got better, she wanted to write a book about her condition(s), but more oriented on her tips how she overcame her disorders (she still struggles from time to time but compared to the previous, she lives much more healthy and happier life). Then I came to the idea (as I work in the IT industry) to make some kind of educative mobile app that will help others struggling with food addiction and BED.\n\nWe asked students of psychology and their professors to help us on this project to fill the educative content, in form of 90 educative videos that will lead a person through a 3-month therapy.\n\nThere is also a community section, like here on Reddit and some other features like statistics, motivation and helping others in need.\n\nHonestly, you can call my post marketing, the app is new on the Google store, we published it just 2 days ago. I never used Reddit as a marketing tool, so besides naked marketing, this is also an invite to try something different (I hope it is). Maybe those educational videos will help you, maybe the community will. Or maybe it is a waste of time. We don't know so at least we would appreciate to give us a feedback :)\n\nThere are probably still some bugs and we will update the app regularly so it should be better every day.\n\nHere is the link to Google store: [deVicer mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=life.devicer.devicer)\n\nHave a good day, wherever you are struggling with this disease!", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

Honestly, I think it\u2019s always been my body type that I hate more than my weight. \n\nFirst of all, I have tiny hands and fat fingers, got em from my dad (he\u2019s a normal weight). I\u2019ve had people laugh at my fingers and express shock that my fingers are fat and I\u2019m not- I wasn\u2019t offended, like I know they are disproportionately chubby. As are my toes, so I literally never wear shoes that expose my toes and always wear socks (yes even during sex, screamed at a guy for trying to take my socks off once). Then I swear all my fat goes to my cheeks; at the higher end of a normal BMI I even get a double chin. I find it so unfair that some of my overweight friends have chiseled cheekbones and sharp jawlines when my face is round even at my lowest weight. \n\nMy shoulders/collarbones on the other hand are the first place I lose fat, and they look stupidly thin compared to my face (if I complain about my weight to my mom she always says \u2018where?? look at your shoulders they\u2019re so bony!!\u2019). Also, I have small tits- I read that gaining chest muscle makes your boobs look bigger, so I started strength training and working out my chest. I gained muscle and... it looks terrible. When I see photos of myself in a low cut top, espeically in certain lighting, my chest has a slightly athletic look and I hate it. Thinking of getting a boob job eventually but I\u2019m worried about it looking fake since I don\u2019t have much boob to start with. Also hate my nose but I\u2019m basically guaranteed a nose job for this year; going to a consultation soon. \n\nOne major thing I can\u2019t change is that I\u2019m short (between 5\u20193-5\u20194 I\u2019m not sure exactly) and it makes me feel invisible sometimes, I only ever get hit on if I\u2019m wearing heels. Tall girls always look so graceful and I just feel awkward and stumpy all the time. Urgh and my chicken legs- I actually get complimented on my calves a lot but never my legs as a whole because my thighs are so fat in comparison. Yet when I start to get happy with the size of my thighs, my calves and ankles begin to get too skinny for my liking. \n\nI feel like I\u2019ll always be trying to lose weight but it will never make up for all the deficiencies in my body type, many of which surgery won\u2019t fix (there\u2019s no such thing as finger lipo- what the hell?). I\u2019m currently in the high 110s and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a point to losing weight any further because I doubt it will make me happier.

I have a 45 minute drive, so I'll stop at a gas station and get donuts or cookies or something on my way to work. And if there are treats in the breakroom I will eat them all. I will eat too much, so much that I will make myself sick to my stomach and just turn around and go home.\n\n\nThat is what I did this morning. It's a viscous cycle, going to work makes me depressed, so I binge, which makes me more depressed. So I go home and feel even worse about letting my coworkers and clients down, which makes me either want to binge or kill myself. And repeat.\n\n\n\nSo essentially my binging will probably either make me have a mental breakdown and quit my job or get me fired. \n\n\n\nI have a good job, but I can't stand the sedentary nature of office jobs. All I want is to leave here and get a job in my city that I can walk/bike to, so I can leave all my money at home and just eat what I have brought to work. \n\n\n\nI have looked at going back to being a barista or daycare teacher, because I have done and enjoyed those things in the past. But my salary will literally be cut in half. Part of me thinks I need to be a responsible adult and stay, save money to travel with my partner and his child, and save to start a family one day as I want so desperately. But I don't think I can. \n\n\n\nI woke up at 3am this morning suicidal, wanting to take the pills I have hidden. \n\n\n\nI feel like I can't tell anyone the real reason behind my depression and suicidal thoughts. Its vain, I still want people to think of me as cute and little, not a BINGE EATER. \n\n\nSo yea, my inability to confront my binging or even tell anyone about it is causing me to ruin my career, possibly ruin my relationship, and want to end my life. \n\n", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Thank you for the community, and I wish you all perseverance with this ED shit. \n\nMy spell with ED (binge/restriction) began around 15, and I'm 24 now. At the onset it dropped to an unhealthy weight; since then, I've pretty much been in the \"skinny-healthy\" BMI range. Around November I began *really* committing to my ED again in a big way, and I've lost a fair amount of weight. I can't say that I'm not happy about that.\n\nHowever because of (1) self-consciousness and (2) actual fear for my health, I began getting anxious about the toll that my restricting could take on my body (eg eating &lt;1000 calories as a 24M) and whether I was dipping below my \"goal\" weight (set as, literally, the minimum 'normal' BMI weight for my height). I bought a scale\u2014which, yes, problematic\u2014but it's been helpful in reminding me that I'm not gaining massive amounts of weight when I  eat more one day, and that I don't \"need\" to be restricting so heavily because I'm at a point where I'm happy. \n\nI want to channel that energy going forward in the medium term. I'd been engaging in dangerous restriction; now I want to start figuring out how I can (if still neurotically!) put together 3 meals a day that won't make me gain weight, but not lose it either. Sure, it would be great to wake up one day eating whatever and whenever I'd like, but I'll settle for now to be able to get through the day with at least *some* fuel :) \n\nTo that end, whatever experiences people have transitioning from a \"weight loss\" stage of their ED to one that is more concerned with keeping things steady\u2014I'd like to hear it. If you don't think it's possible to attain this steadiness, let me know why\u2014and if you think it's not helpful for a short term solution.  ", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

My mom took me to a nutritionist, and constantly was on my case about how fat I was. One Halloween she took my candy so I wouldn't get fatter. So I started purging! \n\nFrom 12 to 14ish, I was bulimic, started cutting. The only time I ate was to binge and then purge. I also went from dancing 2hrs a week to 6hrs a week. Lost a shitton of weight, was put on antidepressants and taken to therapy a few times.\n\nFrom 14ish to 17, I somehow stopped binging. I ate maybe a yogurt or m&amp;ms here and there, would have an average plate of dinner for appearances when necessary, then would purge it. I was dancing 8-10 hours a week, as well as PE and musical theatre, walking everywhere because my parents rarely drove me, and I have no idea how I did this (I do know my body is paying for it in scores now!) EDNOS was put in my charts at some time around here.\n\n  At 17-18ish, the shit hit the fan when I hit my lowest weight and my mom actually saw me faint (I'd had fainting spells for 4 or 5 years at this point, but she'd never caught me before.) I was majorly cut back from dancing, thrown back in therapy, and had a few appts with a nutritionist (who was lovely!) Not dancing and having no experience with normal eating, I gained and became super depressed.\n\n18-20 I was basically doing anything I could to be harmful to myself- abusive relationships, purging with our without binges, trying alcohol, weed, not eating for long stretches until I partied and b/ped....basically I was trying to block out a lot of trauma.\n\nAt 20, I met my eventual spouse, who had taught me more about eating normally than any patent or therapist tbh. Even still, I went back and forth between behaviors (am I eating and binging? Purging diet coke for some reason? Restricting? Who knows!)\n\nAt 24, I came home from work in a ton of pain. I didn't know it then, but I would never again have a single day where I wasn't in pain. The fight for a diagnosis and treatment took 4 years. I became disabled, and the combo of pain and not being able to leave my bed made me gain a LOT. I was overweight, bulimic, and hated everything. In my wedding pictures I'm at one of my highest weights, and I hate it :(\n\nWhen I found out at 27 I had non alcoholic fatty liver disease, and my dr told me weight loss would also help my back pain, I started restricting again. At first I did really well sticking to a low but normal amount. But eventually I just had to push things, and see how much less I could get away with and not let my spouse notice.\n\n   I recently (turned 29 a few weeks ago) started purging again after my longest ever record going without, (now I'm back to 2 days w/o purging.)\n\n  At this point, I think it's super unlikely that I'll ever recover fully. I've had an ED for nearly 20 years. Fuck, that's the first time I realized that- 20 damn years. Whenever I stop one ED behavior, another is there to take it's place, or I start self harming again (or both!) I almost wish I would've just picked one, so it doesn't feel like I'm fighting 3 bosses at once. \n\n  Anyway, thanks for letting me vent.

She also started talking all the time about how big she is, everyone will say things like \"your tge skinniest in the family\" (she is) and she would start getting angry, even yelling about how we cant have opinions on her body its only her choice what she thinks/does to it, that's when I started wondering. After that started she started to stop liking foods telling our mom \"i don't like that anymore\". Thats when I noticed her losing weight. Now she claims to be going vegan. But when she eats somthing with non vegan stuff in it and someone points it out she goes \"well in not going vegan just yet just slowly cutting foods out\" and I remember doing that to try and hide why I wouldn't eat when i was starving myself years ago. she wont eat practicly anything.she's lost a lot of weight. She still looks a healthy weight but im worried that won't last long. But maybe im just worring to much its just when I was just a lityle younger than her I started to become self destructive, i was self harming all the time and after about 2 years of that I started to restrict foods, by time I was 16 I was skipping meals when at school, that escalated to my chewing and spitting at home, no one at home noticed. Thankfully things turned around for the better after i was hospitalized. But last time I had this feeling about another family member, I saw so many warning signs I had that no one saw in them or me and eventually it all came to be true and they got help and im scared for my sister, but I'm to afraid to try and ask her about it should I be worried or am I just being a over worried sister??\n\n", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

I use sugar to comfort myself when I'm having one of my regular anxiety attacks. I will buy 8 slices of fancy dessert at a bakery on the corner, walk home with them in my bag, and eat them all in 10 minutes, tuffing them down my throat, barely tasting anything, feeling zero pleasure and only stomach pain. (I don't throw it up.)\n\nI have a bad relationship with food. On a daily basis, all I eat is fresh spaghetti &amp; tomato sauce with premium parmesan cheese. Every meal, every day. It causes me alot of anxiety to prepare food at home, and prepared food is made by strangers with unknown quality ingredients &amp; that freaks me out.\n\nI know I need medication for my OCD and my anxiety, but I don't trust it at all. My brother needed serious drugs for mood disorders as well as a chronic illness and he's gone through such bad side effects for years. Witnessing him going through that, and seeing how little real effect those drugs had, and seeing how he &amp; others rely on them - has made me completely put off medication.\n\nI hate writing \"feelings\" out. I'm not a writer. All these books about emotional eating are all about writing \"feelings\". I can't be dealing with that. I have an addiction - you can't \"feelings\" your way out of a heroin addiction, it hasn't worked for me. Counselling is bullshit. They are trained in body image eating disorders, not emotional eating disorders, and I'd rather take the hard earned money from my $10/hr job on rent not a therapist's Porsche. They don't know what they're facing when they talk to me. They don't know what they're talking about.\n\nThis is more of a situational problem, my emotional problems are just what they are. I need to move into my own apartment. Currently I live in a space with 4 roommates - I can't possibly cook when the kitchen is occupied by anybody but me. Even with my bedroom door closed, the presence of other people in the house ratchets up my anxiety. But I can't move out because a bachelor apartment is triple what I can afford. (miraculously get a better job? i have academic problems, I couldn't get a college diploma though I've tried 3 different programs)\n\nI'm hoping that I find a life partner who enjoys cooking good food so they can introduce better meals in my life.

At an early age my response to enforced fasting was to prolong my fasting after the punishment was over out of defiance. At some point fasting became satisfying to me. \n\nOutside of the cult, after seeking mental health treatment for PTSD I was told I was using fasting as an unhealthy coping mechanism for my anxiety. In 2009 I was referred to a support group for eating disorders.\n\nMy relationship with food imploded from there. I was introduced to so many ideas and behaviors I\u2019d never considered before. I learned to hate myself in whole new ways. My fasting gained a new component linked to my weight and appearance. My self-image has never been the same. \n\nSome of the girls/women seemed to be engaged in this between-the-lines competition to be the \u201cworst case\u201d. Sometimes I felt like they were bragging or excited to relay their experiences relapsing, especially the members who were there because of pressure from family. Many seemed to be more interested in learning to mask their disorder better than recovery. There was an undercurrent of wishing the negative symptoms and attention would resolve without them having to give up wanting to obtain/maintain their goal weight. The therapist seemed completely out of their depth. I felt like there were cliques and subtle bullying going on that went completely unchecked.\n\nOnce I started spending time with other members outside of the group and saw/heard them completely uncensored I knew it wasn\u2019t all in my head. I realized it was a very toxic influence for me and stopped going and interacting with most of them. \n\nOne-on-one cognitive behavioral therapy helped me progress incredibly far. My eating will probably always be a little disordered but I wasn\u2019t endangering my physical health anymore, learning to focus my control fixation around tracking and meeting nutritional requirements approved by my doctors, etc. \n\nRecently I\u2019ve had unprecedented issues with bingeing. My psychiatrist and general doctor seem to be working off the belief it may be an issue with my current medication routine that will be eventually solved by finding the right dosage. In the meantime my therapist suggested I try a support group for eating disorders, in spite of my previous experience. I have problems opening up and confiding in others which makes it difficult to form deep friendships and she thinks learning to relate with and turn to others for support over shared flaws and struggles could be helpful overall and not just with the bingeing. \n\nI know I only experienced one group. The quality of my healthcare has vastly improved and I know my current therapist is much more qualified to monitor this but I\u2019m still scared. Since the urge to binge started I\u2019ve had memories of things the members said/did popping up as repetitive, intrusive thoughts. I\u2019m scared another group will only exacerbate my current issues. My therapist thinks I should try instead of letting my fears from one bad experience continue to close me off. \n\n\ntl;dr: My previous experiences with a therapist-led support group for eating disorders was traumatic and damaging.

No one knows about my ED. \n\nLast Sunday I had the busiest shift ever and didn't eat for the entire 13 hours. This is not abnormal for any of us, because some shifts are just really really busy and critical. Near the end of my shift I suddenly realized how STARVING I was. \n\nOne of my patients was being discharged right at dinner time/shift change. The nutrition aide brought his tray into the room and set it down right as the guy was walking out the door to go home. But once a tray has touched an \"occupied\" room, it can't go to any other patient or be used as an extra tray. The options are either throw it all away or staff can put it in the break room and eat it. This also happens often. \n\nWell I told her that we would gladly take the tray and eat it. But..I didn't want to share it. This guy ordered GOOD food. He had a salad, some sauteed peppers, Spanish rice and roasted turkey. It was good, low cal and high protein and high antioxidant food. No way was I going to lose my only meal of the day to the other savages I work with. \n\nSo I covered the tray in a bunch of plastic wrap and left it on the counter in his now-vacant room, turned the lights off, closed the door, and went to give report to the incoming shift. \n\nAfter shift change, I clocked out and returned to the empty room. But I was SO HUNGRY and a bit sleep deprived. So instead of just taking the tray into the break room and eating, I stood there IN THE DARK and started ravenously eating this untouched dinner tray. \n\nI was standing over the counter in the dark, shoveling salad into my mouth, when a co-worker (who is brand new..like 3rd shift ever kind of new) walked in and turned the lights on to start turning the room over for a new admit. And there I stood, in a previously occupied room, half eaten dinner in front of me, shoveling salad into my mouth like it was the first time I'd seen food in a month. \n\nShe just stared at me for a second and then said \"um, can clean this room for you..?\" and I just said \"ok!\" and grabbed the tray and ran out, still eating it. \n\nAnd I NEVER gave her an explanation! Although I did tell this to my other co-workers yesterday and they about died of laughter thinking this poor new girl thinks we are all a bunch of starving savages. ", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I don\u2019t want to live today with all headspace preoccupied in the tomorrow. I don\u2019t want to keep preparing for when I finally begin my \u201cperfect\u201d diet without fail. And I also don\u2019t want to obsessively count down the days until the next time I give myself planned permission to gorge everything in sight. \n\nI\u2019m finally at a place where I can examine my own perfectionist mentality and challenge it. My body is never \u201cenough\u201d in my eyes. Even when I was at my goal weight, I picked at my stomach and squeezed my thighs with dissatisfaction. Plus it was like any day could ruin all my hard work... and after only a couple of those, it did. \n\nHow do I want to live my life? Mindlessly getting caught up in the inevitable cycle of punitively restricting my food and therefore life, akin to a shaming, controlling tyrant? Or surrender all power, release all control through a day-long (or more) binge? There seemed to exist no compromising middle.\n\nWhile at the gym today, I was observing the different bodies in the room. How would we eat and exercise if mirrors did not exist? We would have to at least be even a little bit more in touch with our bodies. My body doesn\u2019t feel good when I binge. But it also doesn\u2019t feel good when my stomach is aching with hunger. I would never deny a child food if she were hungry... so why do I deny myself? And I would never pressure her to continue eating long past fullness - because tomorrow she can\u2019t - when she is silently screaming no more and then make her run until the machine regurgitates a number that she can stop to counteract the feast... so why am I different?\n\nMy body feels amazing right now but a potential binge is always on the horizon, that which robs me of all future satisfaction once the last bite ends and reality hits. This week I have been feeding her well and exercising each day. But she is tired. After the gym today, I thought about just ignoring that pang in my stomach. But then I thought about giving my body what she deserves - not what I think she needs to look better for tomorrow. I ate some crackers with hummus and an apple with peanut butter. And I am satisfied. And so is she. I have to remind myself that I don\u2019t need to go to bed with a hungry tummy nor one that is bursting from the inside. It is okay to eat a little extra and nothing more.\n\nThis is a constant journey that will probably never end. But it has given me insight as to how I live my life in ways beyond food that I cannot ignore. I want to be the person for myself that I needed as a child. I have been searching for people to validate me, numbing my deepest unmet needs and fears with food, and using other temporary fillers to self-medicate, when really, my own unconditional alliance, love and trust in myself - mind, spirit and body as one - are the needle and thread to truly sew this void back together for good.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I\u2019ve had an extensive history of disordered eating. At the end of high school (4 years ago) for about a year and a half I restricted my intake to 1200 calories a day (MAXIMUM) and burned off about an additional 500 a day. According to my therapist, I qualified as \u201canorexic\u201d at the time. I\u2019m not sure about that because I wasn\u2019t underweight. But I\u2019m not sure. My parents (including my dad who is a DOCTOR) kept telling me I needed to diet and that my diet was healthy as it was, even though I was only getting around a net of 800 calories a day. Earlier this year, I developed binge eating disorder and subsequently gained the aforementioned weight. My parents keep telling me that I\u2019m now ugly / not as appealing in comparison to how I looked before AND keep thrusting their unhealthy dieting tips upon me. My dad even told me that I should sit around and starve myself rather than exercise (so as to avoid gaining muscle mass and subsequently, weight). He also told me that 1000 calories is a sufficient amount of calories and that that\u2019s more than enough for me. My mom agrees with him. This is really bothering me and making me feel so much worse mentally. All I want is to be healthy and get some positive encouragement. They make me feel so mediocre no matter what I do (unless I lose weight - then they\u2019re delighted). Do you guys think my parents are right, and I\u2019m over exaggerating?

They seem very meaningless, but they have a hidden reward: dopamine accomplishment! I was wondering why I felt so good the past few days, why I haven't been binging, why I haven't been getting (as many) negative thoughts lately. It's because I am getting my source of satisfaction from another source other than food. And let me tell you, controlling my food intake is so much easier.\n\nSure, it distracts you, but that's not the main point. It gives you a purpose (even if it's stupid and pointless) and once you complete that purpose, you get rewarded with dopamine. It's also important to note that it's not like an instant rush or anything -- it's hidden. So you won't actually feel any difference (right away), but you will see improvements in your behaviour and attitude. I feel like if you do these things with the goal of distracting yourself it won't work because you're not actually focusing on the tasks you're just focusing on avoiding the negative... so enjoy what you're doing.\n\nThe whole reason why I got BED was because I was doing extreme food behaviours: I was restricting hard, then binging hard, then exercising too much, etc because I was trying to control the one thing I could control. But then when my body rejected this behaviour and just went full on BED, I lost that sense of control, and with it I also lost the last sense of dopamine/accomplishment/etc. I screwed up the one thing I had in balance. But now, I'm getting it back. I'm putting my body back into balance and I'm not going through extremes. I'm gonna be productive by changing my source of accomplishment from something beneficial. \n\nI'm currently making a whole list of mild accomplishments (they need to be mild - I am not doing extreme accomplishments right now). This so far includes: going to the park &amp; picking a random destination, studying up to X page number, eating 5 fruit/veg servings every day, creating my fashion style (accomplishment = downloading new inspo pics), exercising for 5 mins, playing a game, showering. My list is still pretty short.\n\nAnyways, this is working for me. I'm near the end of my binge recovery so this may not help you so much right now if you're at the beginning. I've already basically reprogrammed myself to eat something healthy whenever I feel like binging instead of actually binging on junk food. This was my next step. Sorry for writing so much!\n\n.\n\nTLDR: doing little tasks gives you a sense of accomplishment, which fill your \"never being satisfied\" void, so you don't feel like binging anymore. make sure they're not hard/big/extreme tasks, since they will likely not work.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

My weight has always been up and down and I don\u2019t know how to just maintain a healthy weight. In college when I was about 21-22yo I lost 100lbs. I ate very healthy following the paleo diet. I felt amazing and working out was something I enjoyed. After graduating college the weight piled back on. It\u2019s been a constant struggle ever since then. After that is when I started really bingeing, before losing all that weight I was just inactive and overate. Ever since graduating it\u2019s been a never ending cycle of me bingeing then having a little motivation for a month or two and then back to bingeing. My doctor put me on some meds to help with the binge eating. At first it was working great. I started it in August and had lost 20lbs by October. Everything went downhill after going on a trip to visit a family member. My eating went down the drain and was rationalized because it was a vacation. Ever since that I\u2019ve been bingeing non stop. From October until now I\u2019ve gained that 20lbs back give it take a pound or two.

I use numbers to prove I am a failure.  In short, nothing was ever good enough.  Or - when it was - the next number would inevitably fail to measure up.  (I have been counting things for a very long time so I've gotten pretty good at eyeballing which, rationally, likely unconsciously informs some of my decisions.)  \n\n**OBJECTIVITY** : Reframe negative statements and thoughts into objective (not positive) ones.  For example 'I am disgusting' becomes 'I am bloated and uncomfortable.'  Or 'screw all this' becomes 'this is overwhelming.'  I apply this to all negativity, not just that surrounding food, exercise, and body image.  \n\n**MEAL PLAN** : My hunger and satiety signals are still pretty much shot, but I use sound reasoning for what and how much to eat.  I make a loose food plan each evening for the following day but I do not follow it verbatim or update it to reflect any changes I make.  The point is not to track but to shore up rational thoughts for moments of high emotion.  \n\n**CONSCIOUSNESS** : I pointedly focus on the food as I eat it.  First I tried going for the total-deprivation food-only zen-meditation experience but it's not realistic for me.  I just make a mental note of smells, flavors, textures, and how much I like something.  Taking pleasure in the food rather than the act of eating makes it easier to reach satisfaction.  \n\nIt's been 10 weeks now, right through all the major holidays and a lot of work stress, and I've finally felt calm, like the chatter in my mind has lost its voice.  My clothes are all fitting again.  The pint of ice cream I bought lasted two weeks.  My husband ate all the peanut butter cups and I didn't even notice.  At work when I have an unplanned treat, I go on with my day like it didn't happen.  I exercise because I feel like it and not because I'm punishing myself.  \n\nI know this isn't for everyone, but I spent two years trying every 'solution' I could get my hands on.  The problem for me was that every time I broke the 'rules' I would spiral out of control.  By eliminating as many rules as possible - by embracing flexibility - I gave myself a lot more leeway and the ability to focus on how I felt and not how I measured up.

And I could eat it, but I'm a well trained animal. I know that if I do, my owner will come back eventually and they'll know, and I'll be punished for my lack of restraint and obedience.

I thought it was super triggering when she mentioned that because now I feel like I need to lose weight instead of focus on recovery and the apples thing just sounded like really naive advice since restricting my sweets to fruits only kind of lead me to developing bulimia.

High prolactin to blame?", "author": "htxslp", "self_text": "I\u2019ve been dealing with BED for the past 3-4 years. I felt like it was triggered by stress\u2014I had finally graduated with my master\u2019s degree and started career. Of course with BED, the weight started to pack on and before I knew it, I had gained 30 lbs within 3 years. Not horrible but hey, I hadn\u2019t been overweight in nearly 15 years.\n\nRealizing that I needed more help to fight BED, I began taking Vyvanse last February, did strict keto for a few months (now more so low carb), and began to workout more consistently. I lost 25 lbs and then gained back 5 lbs (a stubborn 5 lbs might I add). On top of that, I began having irregular periods last year. I initially chalked this up to having missed a few birth control pills within a pack; however, when I started to have a period only every 4 months, I began to worry. Obviously it\u2019s not because I\u2019m pregnant (which I never have been). So I go to my doctor who then ordered blood tests to check my hormone levels and thyroid. Everything came back normal with testosterone and prolactin being on the high ends of normal. My doctor then recommended I see an endocrinologist who also ordered blood tests. Those results all came back normal as well except this time my prolactin was 10 points over the cut off. \n\nSo the endocrinologist suspects a possible pituitary gland tumor and wants an MRI done if by chance my prolactin doesn\u2019t fall into the normal range 4 weeks from now. Prolactin is a hormone released by the pituitary gland in your brain. It is especially released when women become pregnant as it stimulates breast milk, increases the mother\u2019s appetite and slows down her metabolism for the health of the baby. This made some sense to me because my nipples have secreted a tiny amount of clear fluid for nearly 10 years (only secretes when squeezed). I saw a doctor at the time but he did not make a big deal of it nor recommend any type of treatment so I didn\u2019t do anything about it despite it being very odd. So yeah, on top of dealing with BED to try to lose weight, I\u2019ve got this to deal with.

For the past 7 years I\u2019ve dealt with binge eating. It caused me so many problems. I developed binge eating issues after being sexually assaulted at 10 years old and the eating got worse in college. I had a stroke, aneurysm, and had a dangerously high blood pressure. One night after a bad binge, I fell asleep after chugging water. I woke up vomiting violently. That\u2019s how I discovered purging accidentally. Since that night in 2016, I\u2019ve dealt with binging and purging. After a year of bulimia, I had to stop only because my parents were finding food in the sink and seeing food disappear. On Halloween night of last year, I relapsed hardcore. Since then I haven\u2019t been able to stop b/p.

I've always overeaten - ever since I was a pre-teen. Some of it came from the fact that when money was tight, that even though we always had food, I often wouldn't get the opportunity to eat until I was actually full. So when I had the chance to eat and feel full, I took it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSenior year of high school is when it began taking more dramatic turns - stopping at 7-11 on the way home from school to buy packs of cookies or a bag of chips and eating it all before my mom got home, hiding the remains in my bedroom. It got even worse in college -, especially after a bad day. Buy enough Wendy's that can feed 3 people and eat it all, down five slices of pizza even though I felt full at 2. My culture also has this habit of overfeeding children, questioning you if you don't eat or only eat a little bit (which is often a normal amount), eating greasy and fried food. A plus side to that is that I do think my culture is more body positive toward plus size women than the predominant American culture I'm exposed to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut for so long  I was always able to keep the weight off, for the most part, I always felt healthy, there were no alarms.

I'm miserable at this job - so fucking miserable. I'm leaving the position soon (plans are in motion, I'm pretty prepared on this front), but I can barely make it through the day. My binge eating is now happening at an increasingly alarming weight. It's sometimes every day or at least twice a week. This is enhanced due to the fact that my job is very busy, so I'm not eating three meals a day. I'm lucky if it's two. So half the time I overeat because by 7pm I'm famished, and the other time I overeat because in the moment - it feels fucking amazing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut unlike before, I don't feel fine.

I luckily actually connected with a 14 year old girl who lived across the country. We emailed about our lives for years and the below is an email I sent her in October 2009. I was surprised by my insightfulness, but in retrospect, that thoughtful and intentional processing is what really helped me with getting through Recovery. It's been almost ten years of Recovery. You can get there too. Below is a portion I wanted to share. \n\n\nHello, my dearest friend!\u00a0 I've been thinking of you, and I know I needed to write to you. It's so hard for me to write to people these days.\u00a0 I am at 7 months of recovery: 7 months of therapy, 5 months of seeing a nutritionist, 4 months of going to a support group.\u00a0 Every day is so different, and my mind is not something I feel like I understand or know any more.\u00a0 Every day I'm learning about another lie I told myself and everyone else around me.\u00a0 Every day I struggle with knowing I need to eat, and wish that I could just be like everyone else.\u00a0 I wish I could be like everyone who eats without thinking about what it would do to their body.\u00a0 There are days I will make myself sit with food in front of me, and running through my head is every thought of \"If I eat this I'll be fat.\u00a0 If I eat this, no one will want to be my friend any more. If I eat this, I will lose my job...\" Everything is illogical and inane, and I know better.\u00a0 I'm learning exactly what it means to have a Disorder.\u00a0 I've been reading a lot of recovery books that teach about the two seperate parts of my brain--there's me, the girl who wants to love herself and live life, and there's ED, who wants me to believe I'm worthless and undeserving of love.\u00a0 It's taken me seven months to fully embrace this concept, and somedays I still struggle with it.\u00a0 However, I realized the other night, while browsing through facebook, that everything I look at on other's pages and I'm envious of, they're all things that I could've done but didn't because of Ed.\u00a0 Ed took away 15 years of my life, so far, and I don't want to give him another day.\u00a0 I want to love, I want to laugh, and I want to be part of this world, I want to join communities, and accept myself as I am.\n\nOne thing that I have learned is that Ed gives the promise of perfection.\u00a0 \"If I can reach this weight, my life will become perfect.\u00a0 People will love me, I'll get a boyfriend, and I'll do great at my job.\"\u00a0 Isn't that crazy?\u00a0 That everything in my life will become perfect based entirely on my weight?\u00a0 But it's what I believed, it's what Ed convinced me to believe.\u00a0 And I'm not the only one who believd Ed's false promises... every girl in my support gorup believed the same thing.\u00a0 Every one of us all feel like we're worthless, and that if only we can get to that\u00a0weight\u00a0life would be\u00a0perfect.\u00a0 And I'm surrounded by women of all sizes and weight, and seeing the ones that are so tiny, and realizing that they're where I would want to be and they're still not happy.\u00a0 It sinks in.\u00a0 I feel like I'm crazy.\u00a0 I talk about voices in my head... there's always a struggle between my real thoughts and the illogical ones of Ed.\u00a0 The fact that my thoughts are in my head is a huge step for me.\u00a0\u00a0My voice\u00a0has been silent for too long.\u00a0 My truths and honesty and beliefs have been silent for too long.\u00a0 I'm making really good strides right now.\u00a0 Every day isn't perfect, but I have done so much for me that I have always been afraid of before.\u00a0 I have the girls in my group that make me feel loved and less alone.\u00a0 I have joined a choir, and it's part of a church.\u00a0 I'm still struggling with accepting God back in my life.\u00a0 For so long, I believed that there was no way He could love me.\u00a0 I know He can and He does, but that's overwhelming for me most days.\u00a0 And my exercise-restriction is finally up, and I'm allowed to find a place to do kickboxing, so long as it's a happy-attitude place and not full of testerone and body image.\u00a0 I'm excited for that.\u00a0 I want to work out and feel the strength of my body again, and remember it in a better light than I have in a long time.\n\nThe bottom of my email finished with my recovery mantra, \"Courage doesn't always roar.

Anyway, I'm in my late 20s and I've been struggling with an ed for 16 yrs. I've been across the spectrum but it has mainly been periods of restricting and periods of b/p (there was a period where I was straight binging and it was absolutely terrifying).\n\nAnyway, I am really exhausted by it and I don't know what to do. I was in tx for nearly a year back in 2014-2015 and it wasn't effective for me. I was pretty underweight when I started and I really thought I could handle the weight restoration process... I was very wrong and my mental health tanked to the point of becoming suicidal (mostly passive thoughts but there were a couple scarier times). I can actually say that tx traumatized me. \n\nAfter I finished tx I got stuck in a really bad b/p phase (and gained more weight as a result). It was absolute hell and I was unable to function (I pretty much stopped attending classes and my nearly perfect GPA suffered a lot).\n\nI fell into pretty bad restriction in the latter part of 2017(with periodic episodes of b/p) and have only just started trying to eat better/be more recovery minded back in December 18 after: 1) having too many arguments with my SO (essentially all being related to my ed), and 2) having a bit of a scare in late December (I collapsed and was going into shock \nbc of low bp and low blood sugar). \n\nI should note that I was just barely underweight at the time so it's not like I was at death's door with my weight. My motivation has unfortunately dropped since then and I am now basically just over the minimum healthy weight for my height. I legitimately have a small frame so the idea of gaining more weight is extremely off-putting. \n\nThat being said, my SO wants me to put on a little more. I initially agreed with it because I was honestly in mindset of just wanting to be healthy. Additionally, I recently started seeing a therapist and she seemed to agree with the weight my SO would prefer to see me at. I don't know if I can tolerate weight gain though. I am still doing much better than I was before December but I am still engaging in behaviors (they're much less severe though). I should also note that counting kcal is necessary for me because it keeps me more in check (with restricting and b/p).\n\nAnyway, I need to somehow rekindle that motivation because if all goes as planned I'll be starting a master's degree in the late summer. I absolutely can't allow my ed to get in the way with that. Additionally, my SO and I want to have kids in a few yrs and I really need to be in recovery for that (for so many reasons). I am also completely exhausted by my ed. \n\nThis is quite long but I guess I'm asking for suggestions on how to handle this (and get into a fairly solid state of recovery). If anyone has any insight or suggestions on this I'd love to hear them.\n\nThanks.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I, personally, was shocked and bewildered by this discovery.\n\nBut seriously though, I've been eating the most delicious desserts lately, more or less every night for the past 2 weeks I think, and two discoveries have come from this. 1) Absolutely no negative consequences arose from my doing this. Nothing. Like, not a single bad thing happened. I didn't gain a million pounds, or have any change in appearance whatsoever actually now that I'm weight restored. And 2) I discovered that dessert is actually the best thing in the world and makes me look forward to dinner like nothing else. It's fun deciding what I'm going to have for dessert that night, sometimes it's super decadent like delicious chocolate babka from my favourite jewish bakery or some apple cake, sometimes it's simple like a few biscuits and some dark chocolate, but either way, it's such a nice sweet end to the day.\n\nI used to view dessert for a long time as this super \\~indulgent\\~ thing that would be dangerous to consume on a regular basis, because in my ED brain, any type of eating that was *that* satisfying and filling must be inherently dangerous. So being able to eat dessert every single night lately and have no negative consequences to it has been a really empowering reminder that ED brain is entirely irrational, makes completely incorrect assumptions about likely outcomes to events, and overall not worth listening to.\n\nHope you're all having a good week so far, and go eat some dessert next time you can, it's delicious! x", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I didn\u2019t overeat when itfirst happened. The eating habits sort of caught up with me when my metabolism stabilised.

I would always feel like crap about it the next day and that evening.

I don\u2019t feel like I would cope very well spending a week away now and not have a takeaway at least. I went on a Keto diet when I was diagnosed with prediabetes I guess I did this out of fear more than anything and gave up pizza for a month or 2. I went to a party which had pizza and I was a bit like oh go on then and I ate 2 pizzas. That was the beginning of the end of that diet and I was back on weekly pizza binges. A couple of months after the diet I allowed myself to eat it more often by having at least 2 a week. I put on some weight at this point and then I tried cutting down portion sizes. This has helped me quite a bit tbh and I worry a bit less about ordering so frequently. But now I\u2019m ordering about 13 a month on average and sometimes big ones. I\u2019m also ordering other stuff too. I would usually stick to a 3 day routine but now I find myself ordering different takeaways between. \n\nIf I get urges quite frequently is that an addiction?

For the last 6 months, I haven't really had any issues with food other than the occasional binge. Unfortunately, I've recently gained a lot of weight over the holidays from binge eating. I went from a healthy weight to an unhealthy one and I know to some thats nothing, but to me, its a lot (I'm 5'3 by the way). So, 4 weeks ago, I decided I'd start going to the gym and become fit and healthy. I started going to the gym 6 days a week and my body has drastically changed already. It went really well for the 4 weeks. I was not starving, I had 1 cheat day, I felt good and energetic and body positive. However, I started to get discouraged because I was eating a healthy caloric diet and have only lost a small amount of pounds. Yes, I have been eating the right things. I'm trying to keep in mind that I also gained a lot of muscle.\n\nI promised myself I wouldn't go diet crazy. I promised myself being healthy and fit wouldn't get out of hand like it always does. But now, for the past 4 days, I've been eating way under the normal amount of calories a day and I've become obsessed with losing weight. I'm still going to the gym and I feel weak. My binge cravings have gone up by 1000% and I feel that its all going to fall apart and that I'll be fat again.

TL;DR - having problems starting my recovery.\n\nAfter many years of (undiagnosed) Anorexia interspersed with b/p behaviours I have tried multiple times recently to commit to recovery. I was BMI 14 when I began just before Christmas, was weighed for an unrelated health issue earlier this month (Crohn's disease - which unfortunately/fortunately makes it easy to mask my behaviours) &amp; seeing I'd gained 4 kg stopped me in my tracks. I haven't weighed myself recently but assume I am the same weight or higher &amp; have been in a binge/restrict cycle ever since.\n\nTo be honest, recovery was not going well anyway. I felt bloated, heavy, clumsy, uncomfortable &amp; although I know that's all to be expected it's just so much to take in. Especially when I have a young daughter, I felt so uncomfortable that even bending over to play with her hurt.\n\nI have recently begun watching a lot of Tabitha Farrar, reading up on recovery blogs &amp; pro recovery Instagram posts to try &amp; motivate myself but I'm having problems.\n\nI can't stop counting calories. Even on a day I commit to eating unrestrictedly I log a \"generic binge\" of 5k calories &amp; feel the shame welling up inside of me. The overwhelming guilt that tells me I'm using \"recovery\" as an excuse to be greedy, lazy, a pig. \n\nNever mind that I want to be able to have family meals at the dinner table without sitting there with a huge salad while everyone else has a proper meal. Or I want to be able to go out for dinner or dessert with my family &amp; enjoy it rather than desperately estimating calorie counts at restaurants with no nutritional information.\n\nI find every time I begin recovery I am hit with extreme hunger. Not physical. I am not hungry. Ever. This is mental. This is craving sweets, chocolate, bread...heavy stodgy food my ED brain despises &amp; shames me for. I find I can let go for a day, enjoy myself sometimes even, then the next day I'm slapped in the face with the bloat, the guilt, the discomfort. Then I'm back to fasting &amp; restricting.\n\nI am recovering (haha) on my own. My husband knows of my problem but doesn't understand. He believes I can just \"eat normally\". I had a chocolate bar (a creme egg to be exact) for breakfast one day even though we were going out for lunch later, I thought it was a real win &amp; I was so proud. He shamed me for it. \"So, that didn't even last a week then. Why didnt you just have toast or cereal?\" he said. As if I was some disgusting loser who didn't eat the appropriate food at the appropriate time. I didn't realise I *had to* have cereal or toast for breakfast. I didn't realise I could only have certain foods at certain times to be normal. I clearly don't know how to eat. I haven't discussed food with him since &amp; nor has he brought it up.\n\nI have never been formally diagnosed but have struggled with AN since my early teens, I am now 32 with a 3 year old daughter. I managed to eat well during my pregnancy with the constant thoughts that I could lose the weight after my daughter's birth. Which I did. 35lbs of it. Very fast. I then maintained this loss for almost 3 years (5\"3/5\"4 I'm not sure exactly which, recently measured at 5\"4 at a hospital appointment though, 80lbs) before the bingeing began. \n\nI decided I'm tired. I'm so tired of the counting, the walking, the insomnia, the exhaustion, the fact I haven't had a period since my daughter was born, the occasional purging that has messed up my teeth. I decide, I'm gung-ho, I'm going to do it! Then extreme hunger, the response, the bloat, the guilt, the vicious cycle.\n\nI don't have the time to get any sort of professional help what with looking after my daughter, the waiting lists are really long from what I understand (NHS in the UK seems to be a year on average) &amp; I can't drive anyway (I never learned) so I couldn't even get to any appointments I managed to get. \n\nI don't know my weight, I hate my body, I hate this cycle. I don't really have any questions I suppose, I guess I'm just looking for some sort of reassurance or support - that lots of people go through something like this at the start. The faltering, the discomfort, the questioning &amp; second guessing &amp; the weight gain anyway. It's not even about weight...but it is. I don't know anymore.\n\nThankyou so much for reading if you got this far. I truly appreciate your time.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

This is not to shit on getting formal treatment AT ALL. But, I think treatment for ED's could be a lot better and  there are ways that they systematically reinforce eating disorder behaviors through treatment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example, I started seeing a dietitian when I was 16 ish for my first brush with anorexia. I told her I wanted to eat salad dressing again and she was like.... \"whats in the dressing\" and I said \"vinegar and vegetable oil and seasoning\". She made a point to say vegetable oil was unhealthy and to use canola oil instead. This seems like a small thing to nitpick, but at age 16 I just wanted to go back to being normal, and changing out foods for being 'unhealthy' was not my normal. I've seen 3 dietitians in the last 5 years and only one of them didn't add extra health distortions to my mind.  \n\n\nAnother thing is having goal weight ranges. Tabitha Farrar posted a video about why she doesn't force her clients to be weighed in recovery because using the fact that they are 'underweight' as motivation to gain weight backfires when the client is no longer technically 'underweight' but needs to gain weight to fully restore their physical and mental health. Even now after my relapse I have a goal weight range set with my therapist and I'm kinda like.... \"what if I go over it? What if i need to go over that range in order to free myself of this disease?\". I feel like having a ceiling on weight gain is your treatment team being afraid of the same thing as your eating disorder is. How can you gain weight when your team is as afraid of you getting fat as your ED brain is?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;** I'm interested in if anyone else things they noticed in treatment that systematically added to your ED thoughts/Behaviors. I don't mean one-off comments from irresponsible caretakers( I know those happen a ton though and its infuriating ), but moreso how treatment fails ED patients by reinforcing ED thoughts.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I had always been built very solidly, and was a little bit overweight, although I was never very athletic and did not do much exercise, my weight was consistent and the exercise I did through active games was enough, so addiction to coke was not a perceived problem.\n\nIt was soon after graduating from high school in 2016 where I started to put on weight. I started a desk job which permanently removed any aspects of activity and exercise in my life, and I would naturally begin to live much more sedentary. With a larger abundance of food options at work, I took advantage of the privilege of eating out, and did so everyday and the two cans of coke I drank became three, and I would consume a little over a litre everyday!\n\nI started to notice my weight gain when my work shirts were getting rather snug and gaps were forming between buttons within six months. But I did not take it very seriously since I followed an article that said weight gain after school is quite normal and I felt my metabolism was fast enough to cope with my eating and drinking.\n\nI did eventually switch to healthy frozen meals a few months later so I could change my image at work, but did not get big results but little did I know how much coke I was still drinking which was taking up at least a quarter of my recommended calorie intake. I did not cut back on coke and it hindered me from progressing with weight loss.\n\nI gave up on frozen meals after getting sick of them for a while, and I went back to eating out for lunch and after work on a daily basis with each meal washed down with a coke. And as time went on, my appetite grew, my portion sizes got bigger, my silent addiction to coke was getting worse, and my metabolism just couldn\u2019t keep up anymore.\n\nI became increasingly lazy and lethargic and I was just going through the motions for several months. I would just wake up, drive to work, sit all day at the computer, eat out for lunch, sit at my desk again, drive home and eat a meal sized snack on the way and retire more the night. I would veg out the entire weekend, drink two litres of coke straight from the bottle and I found myself getting bigger, rounder, wider and unhealthier without any self control or motivation to change the way I live and take care of myself.\n\nIt took until July 2018 when I had a casual conversation with my director at work, and he expressed his worries for my health and my significant weight over two years. My family had always been worried about my weight and my bad diet for years and I would end up getting as big as my dad, but this conversation was different. My director is very kind and gentle, he struggles to express himself verbally and avoids conflict and confrontation, so when he said I had been putting on weight, it really hurt me.\n\nI then looked at the rubbish bin under my desk and I was disturbed by how many coke cans were inside, painting an image of how much coke I consume daily and how my habits have become detrimental to my health. I realised that I do suffer from brain fog, the lack of energy, and finally, the amount of coke I drink per week, per month and per year It speaks to me that I have an addiction and I must do something about it, let alone my weight.\n\nTo this day, I have not had a sip of coke or anything fizzy in over six months, although my food diet is still all over the place. I am slowly losing some weight and have been feeling good for a while without it. However, in the background, I still get thoughts and temptation of drinking. I just miss drinking it, I miss the taste of it. I cannot get coke out of my head and I cannot seem to let go.\n\nLately when I am sleeping, for at least twice a week, I have dreams of drinking a large coke from McDonalds and going for seconds, thirds and fourths. It then messes up with my head thinking I did drink coke despite the adamancy of not drinking it at all when I am awake.\n\nI really am lost and do not know what to do! Do I keep on going and risk feeling more anxious and feel worse about the dreams I have been having, or do I just give in and have a can and take some positive things out of my restriction to this sweet poison?

Lots of numbers will be included, in case anyone is sensitive to that.\n\nI descended into a proper, full-blown relapse around 5 or 6 weeks ago after spending several months (maybe longer) kind of teetering on the edge. But since mid December, I\u2019ve lost 7-12 pounds (the first five was mostly bloat/water weight so I\u2019m conflicted on whether or not to count that). Doesn\u2019t actually sound like a lot, but considering my height it kind of is. My BMI has gone from the low 17s (low 18s if you count the bloat weight) to the upper 15s. And I don\u2019t see it slowing down any time soon. Most days I struggle to hit above 500 calories\u2014 I\u2019m pretty much living off veg, eggs, rice, almond milk, and either a serving of Special K or chips. Scary thing is, it\u2019s not even entirely on purpose. It\u2019s just what I do now. During my first bout of anorexia, every single thing I consumed was thoroughly planned out and I did a pretty good job of maintaining a relatively balanced diet. Now? Lol plain white rice is totally a legit meal!!! And maybe I\u2019ll have an egg at midnight because at least that\u2019s a few grams of protein, look at me being ~healthy!\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m quite pleased to see the number on the scale dropping tbh, even if it is at an alarming rate (I\u2019ll somehow maintain for a week or so and then drop three pounds in just a few days, rinse, repeat). I want it to keep dropping. I did a happy dance when my BMI finally dipped below 16 and now I\u2019m anxiously awaiting the day that I reach my \u201ccomfortable anorexic weight\u201d for lack of a better term. And oddly, I can actually see the weight loss when I look in the mirror, which has never happened before. Usually when I lose weight (intentionally or accidentally) other people point it out but I can\u2019t see a difference at all. But oh boy, I see it now. Not so much around my stomach and hips, but my arms, legs, and chest/sternum/collarbones are much bonier than they were a month ago. My butt hurts if I\u2019m not careful about how I sit. My armpits and buttcheeks are going hollow again. I see it. I feel it. It thrills me.\n\nHowever. My mother (who lives on the other side of the country) has cancer and is currently undergoing treatment. I\u2019ve not seen my dad in almost two months because he is busy caring for her, and will be until her treatment is done in a few months. I\u2019ve agreed to go to them probably in mid or late March to help out for a few weeks. If my weight keeps dropping at the current rate, I\u2019ll be close to my LW and very obviously emaciated by the time I get there. And it will be even more shocking and obvious considering it will be the first time they\u2019ve seen me in months. As anxious as I am to get back to my LW and then keep going lower and lower until here is literally nothing left of me, I cannot be that low when I go there. All hell will break loose if I can\u2019t manage to pump the brakes on this and maintain my lower but not on my deathbed low weight. I\u2019m confident I can explain away my current weight loss\u2014 stress plus an elimination diet to try to alleviate my debilitating sinus issues/migraines. I cannot explain away much more than I\u2019ve already lost though.\n\nSo my brilliant solution to this problem is to incorporate a cheat day at least once a week. Not as a \u201creward\u201d or to allow myself to satisfy my cravings because honestly I\u2019m not craving much of anything at all, but just to get some extra calories in to hopefully at least slow down my weight loss. I tried a couple of cheat days last week and while I managed to take in more than on a typical day, I was still below maintenance and still lost weight. Yesterday, I ordered pizza (bad idea since I\u2019m legit supposed to be avoiding dairy/gluten/sugar for health reasons, no wonder my digestive system hates me today). I managed enough to hit maintenance but had to throw out the leftovers because I felt ill after what I did eat. This weekend, I\u2019m ordering Thai. Next weekend, an old coworker is coming over and we\u2019re ordering Indian. I\u2019m hoping all of this will help at least a little bit, but I\u2019m probably still going to lose despite the cheat days.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what my point is. I guess I\u2019m wondering if anyone else can relate? I see a lot of people talking about having cheat days for social reasons or to satisfy cravings in order to not binge later, but I can\u2019t remember ever seeing anyone having cheat days they don\u2019t really want in order to lose less weight.

I didn\u2019t think I was fat by any means, just didn\u2019t really register how thin I got as I was so wrapped up in my weight loss. After I stoped restricting and my diet I went into gain weight and cycled to binge/purge which I got myself out of pretty quickly. Weight went up and down with binge/restrict where I find myself now for a little while now. \n\nI planned to stop binging on day 1 of 2019... so far, not completely successful to say the least. I have had a handful of really bad, back to back binges this month. My recent binge was 2 days ago and went for over 3.5 days where I ate 34k calories. Yes, you read that right. Thousand. I have had a couple of extended binge episodes this year where I pretty much don\u2019t stop eating. Quite literally I go from meal to meal to snack to snack. I have retrospectively logged into My Fitness Pal binges around 8-15k calories a day, embarrassed to admit. \n\nWhen I fail, I fail hard and when I succeed I am a meticulous at my diet. I cycle between my VLCD 800 calorie low carb OMAD diet... and full blown manic binges. Which I am desperately trying to control. How do I stop this literally all or nothing approach? I feel I have an absolutely bottomless stomach when I binge, but when I stick to my diet I am fine and lack an appetite most of the time! How do I fix this? How do I stay motivated when something in my head just snaps and sweeps over, and all of a sudden I am in T-Rex mode and eating everything and anything in sight.\n\nI have some weight to lose. 29.6kg to be exact to  get to my dream, within healthy BMI weight.  I am currently overweight but struggling with this yo-yo cycle and getting nowhere fast. I really want to lose the weight and be done with it and be happy. I am a clever girl but I just don\u2019t know what the magic cure is for this madness... Not even a magic cure just some strategies that will work!\n\nSorry for the long post but any help, advice or assistance would be much appreciated.

This analogy was originally for my SO who loves to cook and respects and appreciates food (in all its forms). Anyways, he's supportive and kind and a really great help without even trying. But he's still a little unsure, I can tell. Like he doesn't want to say the wrong thing or ask the wrong question. Like he doesn't get it but he still wants to be there for me. In an effort to make this more relatable, I try to put into words this impossible to describe feeling. A few points to describe my entire reality:\n\nImagine this, you've had the same kind of diet for as long as you can remember. You have a passion for food and really enjoy cooking, you find it therapeutic. It's a hobby that helps you escape the chaos of every day life and you look forward to these moments every day.\n\nThen one day your doctor tells you that you have a serious medical condition and he says, for the sake of your health, you can no longer eat red meat, carbohydrates, sugars, or fatty foods. You never really cared about what you were eating, you just made what you wanted, that was the point. But suddenly there are all these rules to follow and it's hard to stay on track, really hard. You miss cooking to its full extent and the way it made you feel. What was once a comfort now feels like a chore. Except it never ends. Every day you have to keep trying your best, for your health. If you stop, you'll only get sicker. But, if we're being honest, eventually you'll get used to it, and if you're lucky you'll catch the condition before it really hurts you. You'll probably find a new joy within your new lifestyle, just because you feel better than you ever have. But you still miss the comfort your old habits gave you, you might always.\n\nIt's terribly hard to rewire your own brain. The way I feel about myself and about food has always been there, I don't recall a time I didn't feel this way. So for me, it's all I've ever known. I have to unlearn e v e r y t h i n g. Being in recovery feels so alien. I feel stripped of all the things that helped me cope and yet my problems are still there and every day I have to face them, far more vulnerable than before. It's exhausting, facing yourself like that. Being honest. Especially when you yourself are the perpetrator. It's you vs. you, 24/7. I really wanted my progress to be linear. I question my recovery because I can't tell if I've made progress in an area or if my disorder is just changing, adapting. But at the same time, it wasn't that long ago that this would have been an impossible conversation. When the words \"eating disorder\" were something I refused to describe myself with. So sure, I'm going somewhere.\n\nRight now that place is right to the table with the dinner I don't want, but would feel like an asshole if I didn't eat, even if I'm just eating alone.

I got a fitbit about two months ago, and it shows me the average calories I've eaten each day in a week (total calories I've eaten this week divided by 7 days). Because of my binges, my daily average was way higher than I thought--usually 2,000-2,300 calories per day.\n\nYesterday, I thought: \"what if I hadn't binged earlier this week, and I'd just eaten 2,000 calories today?\" That would've been the best day ever! I could've eaten just about whatever I wanted for 2,000 calories! Instead, I had five miserable days of staying within my sad calorie budget and two even more miserable days of binging.\n\nI've thought about substantially raising my calorie intake before, but I was scared of losing weight too slowly. Like most people, I want results now! Well, when I actually look at the calendar, my dumb ass hasn't lost any weight in eight months because I've been binging. I even gained a few pounds. If I wasn't binging, I could've been eating at maintenance every day--I could've ignored this stupid weight loss thing and all the stress and self-hatred it brings.\n\nAlso, my fitbit shows that I'm burning a lot more calories than I thought I was. Everyone says that fitbits estimate too high, but even so, I'm burning more than I expected. I'd been using \"lightly active\" on those TDEE calculators and myfitnesspal, and I don't think that's quite right for me.\n\nSo, I'm RAISING MY CALORIE INTAKE to just a little below my TDEE! On my lazy days, it'll be around maintenance (not going to post the exact number because I don't want to compare myself to anyone else). I'm so excited to eat that much food every day. I had a huge lunch today that kept me full until like 6 holy shit, a wonderful dinner, and even some chips at night. Wow.

I never knew there was a term called \"binge eating disorder\" until quite recently. I was quite pissed off when I made this confession to my talk therapist and she responded \"You're telling me this like I don't already know\". Well...I didn't know. I never thought of myself as a \"binge eater\". Not until I entered CBT/ERP for my OCD, and learned the power of mindfulness. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've started to work on nabbing my bad food habbits again, but it is difficult. At one time I managed to go from 290 LBS to 190 LBS within the span of two years. I currently am roughly 270 LBS (and 6 ft tall) and trying to mentally come to terms that I actually want to work on my binging. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I sit on my couch and watch TV, I'll get the urge to order Domino's lava cakes and cinnamon twists. When I'm on my way to work, I feel the demand to get a chocolate muffin from Au Bon Pain or a McGriddle from McDonald's. It doesn't feel like an option, it feels mandatory. \"This is who I am, this is what I do. It is my sacred ritual, no one can take it away from me\". This is my thought process in the heat in the moment. But as I've learned in my journey to improoving my mental health, that is a lie. That is addiction talking to me. But I don't want to admit it. Not just because I love junk food so much (althought that is obviously a component), but because if I admit it is an addiction, I admit I was wrong for years and years and one of my favorite activities was a lie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I first developed everyday OCD symptoms, my indetity that once seemed as solid a rock turned to dust. I'm afraid of that again. I'm unsure if I want to become a healthy person. I've been victimized by my own mental disorders for so long, they feel as if they are part of my soul. But I know that isn't true; I can exist without my demons controlling me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHas anyone else had a hard time facing the admission of mistake, and trouble with the relationship of food and identity? I'm kinda new to sharing my stuggle with food, so looking to hear stories from others :)", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}
