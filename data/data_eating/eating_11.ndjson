I just need to vent a bit.\n\nI've lost weight on and off for years, never in a disordered way. The past few months, lots of my thoughts have been leaning towards disordered, but I've still been eating at what people say is a safe deficit. Lately I've been really cold, it'll be torture when it's actually winter. I got into weightlifting a while ago, but the past couple weeks I've been making very little progress, I've heard it's a lot harder to build muscle on a deficit. \n\nI figured that even though I'm just above my goal weight, maybe I should try to eat maintenance so I can have more energy, get muscle, and not be freezing. But I just can't do it, unless I have like 3 glasses of wine. Last week I told myself I'd get a pastry while I was at the grocery store, since I was always such a big fan, and have it be a maintenance day. Then I convinced myself that my maintenance is actually lower than what any calculator says so I had a small dinner to make up for it and still be at a deficit.\n\nI eat the same foods every day, and if I'm put in a situation where I have to eat something different for one meal I spend a lot of the rest of the day stressing out trying to figure out what I needed to eat.\n\nI just don't get how this happened.

As I was finishing up the small bowl I made a comment like, \u201cOh I\u2019m running out of Honey Bunches of Oats\u2014 need to get some more soon.\u201d And he said, \u201cWell someone\u2019s a hungry hungry hippo\u201d and I said, \u201cUhh what??\u201d And he replied something like, \u201cYou never want a second bowl, that\u2019s all. Ha ha.\u201d I told him no, I meant we needed to get some more cereal from the store soon, that the box was running low....but like, even if I did want another little bowl why would he say something like that?? I know he wasn\u2019t really thinking and just says weird shit without thinking it through, but it seriously rubbed me the wrong way.\n\n\nAnd our son wanted to have an indoor Halloween pizza party this year since the weather has been so bad.

I know logically that\u2019s still not like a *ton* of food compared to what non-ED people may eat, but I\u2019ve been kind of beating myself up about it, though still *trying* to be okay with it. Well, now it\u2019s around 10:45 pm and my stomach is literally growling and I made a comment like, \u201cUgh why do I feel hungry, this is so annoying. I shouldn\u2019t be this hungry.\u201d And he said, \u201cYeah you ate a LOT today!!\u201d So I\u2019m just kind of like....did I though?? I went through what I ate, and he was like \u201coh and you had pumpkin seeds!\u201d And I said \u201cliterally like 5 of them, but yeah.\u201d And he said, \u201cCalories are calories!\u201d\n\nOf course my ED brain is telling me I\u2019m a pig, but part of me knows I\u2019m still probably at a calorie deficit?? I know he\u2019s trying to lose weight himself\u2014\nI wonder if that plays into it at all? Idk I just hate that he unknowingly feeds into the toxic part of my ED brain and makes me want to restrict harder. And of course now I don\u2019t want to eat a single thing else tonight. I\u2019m already slightly UW (BMI 17.5-17.7ish), and he knows about my disordered eating (I haven\u2019t been officially seen/diagnosed with an ED yet), so I don\u2019t get why he isn\u2019t more mindful about what he says and doesn\u2019t say.

(24 F)", "author": "EDPostRequests", "self_text": "For context, my parents always fed me, I always had lots to eat growing up, and would say I was raised to have a good relationship with food.\n\nAs I\u2019ve gotten older (24 now), I go in phases in my eating. There are 2 ways my eating habits shift:\n\n1) I hoard food. When I\u2019m at other peoples houses eating, I panic when making a plate that I\u2019m not going to have enough to eat and pile my plate as full as possible because I can\u2019t stand the thought of not being full. But I\u2019m also very embarrassed to load a full plate because I don\u2019t want people to know what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s like I almost have an anxiety attack at the thought of possibly not having enough to eat, even if there is a reasonable amount of food to grab from. This mainly happens with unhealthy foods, heavy carbs, fast food, etc.\n\nThis also comes out in times of stress or sadness. I will resort to making/ ordering extreme amount of food, and will binge it all in one sitting. The food is never thrown up, but it feels like I use it as a form of punishment/ comfort. \n\n2) I skip meals/ diet secretly. I will mainly skip breakfast and lunch because no one is around to see me miss it. Or I will skip all forms of carbs and almost exclusively eat fruits and vegetables.  By doing this I feel thinner therefore feel more attractive.\n\nThese 2 habits have ramped up in the last year and I\u2019m not sure how to maintain a steady diet. It\u2019s either one extreme or the other and I can\u2019t specifically figure out what causes either of these swings. Is any of this an eating disorder? Or am I just poorly managing my stress? I\u2019m not even sure what to call what I\u2019m doing.\n\nThank you if you took the time to read all of this.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

It\u2019s now 11am and I\u2019m hungry. I know it\u2019s real hunger bc my stomach is growling. Should I have my mid-morning snack? Wtf am I going to have for lunch?

BY PROGRESS I DON\u2019T MEAN WEIGHT-LOSS but overall physical health, FEELING good, muscle gain, etc.\n\nhi everyone, this is my first post, dunno if anyone will even read it but here goes!\n\nI\u2019ve struggled with my weight since childhood and with binging and other disordered behavior (hiding food, eating in secret, spending way too much money on binge food, etc; I dabbled with purging, too, but I\u2019m not bulimic, it was only a few attempts) since I was a teen.\n\nin the summer of 2018, I was HEALTHILY losing weight as per my DOCTOR\u2019S SUGGESTION. (as I\u2019ve spent my life overweight) I felt like I had my eating under control, I still indulged once in a while but I actually had some structure in my meals (if not a meal plan). (As opposed to binge days where I just eat what I find or buy whatever I want) \n\nSince then, I\u2019ve had to have two long hospital stays - of course with very little exercise (plus shitty hospital food which I compensated for by buying candy); as well as some mental health issues, which I tried to \u201cheal\u201d by comfort eating. Then starting uni again has been stressful, which lead to me if not outright binging, definitely overeating more than ever. ALL THIS MEANS that I gained lots since that summer 2018 and it\u2019s getting bad for my physical health (this isn\u2019t the ED voice talking btw, like it\u2019s a objective fact I\u2019m putting stress on my heart etc) \ud83d\ude1e\n\nTHE GOOD NEWS. \nI am going to the gym pretty often and I signed up for the weightlifting club. Apart from lifting (still a wee beginner though!) in the gym I run or walk in an incline on the treadmill.\nI really enjoy lifting, and my teammates are very nice and happy to help. But I feel like I\u2019m undermining my progress if I eat shitty food full of carbs and little protein. It\u2019s like I\u2019m doing the hard work in the gym for nothing. Rationally, I know all of this. But I feel like I\u2019m on autopilot - I\u2019ve been binging/overeating for a month almost every day, and I feel like I\u2019m stuck.\n\nANY ADVICE/THOUGHTS/EXPERIENCES?\n\nthank you all very much!", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I would sometimes overeat just to numb my feelings of regret and self hate, which hasn't helped me either.My binges turned from monthly to weekly and now to daily. Ive gained about 20 pounds over the course of 2 years.I'm so lost in life now, I'm failing university, it's like I have nothing left to lose (except weight of course). I just overeat everyday, this is all I have in life. Even when everything is going well in my life, I feel the need to self sabotage by overeating. Just a little history about me, I've always been a fat gluttonous pig all throughout my childhood, it wasn't until high school graduation I finally got my eating and weight under control. I used to follow a low carb diet.Now three years later, I'm back to how I was, i don't think im ever going to get the same amount of motivation back. I don't even remember the last time I used to be healthy. I've given up on myself completely. I also feel guilty that ive spent all my father's money on food since he's the one providing me financially.I'm embarrassed of myself and my eating habits. I know that I couldn't continue like this for long. Im just writing this down just so this gives me reality check. Food is the only thing that brings me short term happiness. I haven't told this to anyone because no one is going to understand, they're all going to say that I'm a fat loser with no self control. They're right, I used to have self control, not anymore. All I do is binge. I'm a closet eater which means I pretend to eat healthy in front of others but I would be binging secretly since im ashamed. Once im caught, I couldn't enjoy the food anymore. I couldn't keep up this lie for long since I'm gaining weight. At least before I was able to restrict myself but not anymore, all I do is overeat until I'm sick. I weigh a steady 165 pounds at 5'6 now, I'm a 22 years old female. I have no support, I don't speak to my family about this, and I don't have any guts to tell my college counsellor about this. There are no other counselling services available near my area. This is the only place i could vent this in. So im suffering silently until God knows what happens.I've isolated myself even more, I dont want to show my face to anyone because of my weight gain. I mean I've been fat my whole life so this shouldn't be a huge surprise to them. I promised myself that i was going to lose some weight last summer but I spent the whole summer stuffing my face and I still continue to do it. If my overeating doesn't stop, this is it...my whole life is over, I'm never going to have self confidence,I'll never be good enough for my family, no one is going to want to marry me, I'm never going to be attractive  since this is my whole worth depends on  as a female, especially in this south asian culture where everyone places a huge emphasis on a girl's appearance, if you're not thin then you're basically worthless. There is no hope for me.. I'm a fat disappointment to my family. I've tried fasting but it makes my overeating worse. I've tried keto at one point too but I quitted after few weeks and went back to overeating like the loser I am. Now I feel like I'm the most hideous girl on the planet .All i do is cry and eat now. I dread going back to home because I'll be put down for my weight even more now. I hate holidays because of my weight", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

It's only been a day and a half, and I want to give up so bad. I had eggs with cheese, coffee with creamer (2 cups), a biscuit with jelly, and fried pickles with dip today. This is a lot of food for me, and I know I'll gain weight from it, because in total I bet it's around 1000 or 1200 calories. Even though, scientifically, this won't make me gain weight, the science must be wrong because I know if I weighed myself tomorrow morning (even after no water and a good poop) I will have gained at least a pound. It's probably just my body retaining water, or whatever the fuck, but I know from personal experience (and from other people who post here) this will make me gain weight. I already went up 1.4 pounds since trying to recover yesterday, so knowing that I gained even more than that since then feels bad. \n\nI also don't want to recover because only one person knows about my disorder. I want to tell more people, so that they can know the whole truth of who I am and what I do. I also don't want to tell more people, because they'll watch me too close and be scared for me, which I don't want to do to them or me. I know keeping this journey of mine a secret is probably for the best, but damn I'd be a liar if I said I didn't want to scream \"I'M ANOREXIC\" every day. I want to tell my boyfriend more than anyone else I know, and he might understand because he's said things that sound disordered to me before. Namely, this one time he said \"I'm excited I haven't eaten all day\" and I was like, uhh, are you me? I'm not saying he's also anorexic, but I wouldn't be surprised (he's also a skinny lad). I don't know, maybe I should tell him. He's good with secrets and I trust him a lot, I also love him and don't like keeping this secret. Plus, if he is anorexic, we might be able to help each other. We wouldn't be able to lie to each other like \"I'm not hungry\" or \"I already ate\" because we would know these lies too well, and we could cook safe meals together. Maybe it would be a bad thing, it might end up with us starving together, but I think we're self-aware enough not to let that happen. \n\nOn the list of more reasons I don't want to recover, I feel like a failure. I haven't hit my ugw, and I'm really close. The gw is completely arbitrary, and it's gotten lower with each goal weight being hit, but I've never hit my ULTIMATE goal weight. It's always been 100-99 lbs, and it only changes to 100 from 99 when I get scared of being in the double digits. I must love myself subconsciously, even though consciously I say I hate myself all the time. At the very least I don't want to starve to death, not from my own doing, that's just such a tragic way to die and I'll forever be known as that anorexic who died to everyone I know. I would rather be known for better things, and if I die early it better be from a car crash or something unpredictable. \n\nI only got scared of dying from this disease about a week ago. I was about to fall asleep but I felt really bad, like my body was failing. I felt like my heart was beating really slow, and I was really cold. I doubt I actually was going to die that night, but just in case I went downstairs and ate some peanut butter and had a glass of milk. I probably would've woken up the next day either way, but I wasn't about to die right next to my boyfriend while he slept. I wasn't about to die whether or not he was there, I won't lie, it was a selfish thing. Not a bad selfish, but I only thought about dying next to him a few days later. That feels like a bad thing, but in the moment I was just worried about dying in general, not the specifics. It was kind of a wake up call. I had thought about how this illness might kill me before that night, but it wasn't until that night that it was real. I always brushed off those thoughts with \"well I'm not skinny enough to starve to death\" or \"I eat, just not enough, I'm not literally starving\". It was all bullshit, just because I'm not skinny enough doesn't mean I can't starve to death. I have heart problems in my family, and I drink a lot of caffeine, so heart failure is completely reasonable for me. I guess I just realized I need to take this more seriously after that, even though I want to keep starving.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I have a doctors appointment next week, I\u2019ve just been thinking about this a lot and need to write it out and get it out of my head. It\u2019s probably gonna be pretty long too so I understand if you just skim or something.\n\nBackground: \nI am 18 years old, female, pretty average in every way. The one thing that has made me stand out my whole life is that I\u2019m skinny. Everyone always commented about it. Right now I\u2019m 5\u20195ish and around 100lbs. I have toothpick legs and spaghetti noddle arms and barely an ounce of fat on my body. This has become my identity, it\u2019s how people recognize me, it\u2019s just me. I am fully aware that this is not healthy and I could gain a few pounds, but the thought of even gaining 5-10 pounds and losing my skinny identity is really scary to me. I don\u2019t look at myself and think I\u2019m fat or disgusting, I don\u2019t starve myself, I don\u2019t binge and purge. I don\u2019t have any of the typical eating disorder symptoms. It\u2019s just the fear of gaining weight and losing such a big part of my identity. \n\nMore recently:\nThese past few months have brought a lot of change (mostly adjusting to college) and with that, newfound anxiety. I\u2019ve been struggling with it since August and I haven\u2019t really had anything done about it because I kept telling myself it would go away on it\u2019s own. Well, it hasn\u2019t, and ow it\u2019s starting to physically affect me. That\u2019s a whole different story, but the eating part is what concerns me. I\u2019ve always been a really picky eater and not a huge eater. I mostly only ate for survival. I never really saw the enjoyment in food that other people saw. I would get hungry, and I\u2019d eat. That was all. Since August, I haven\u2019t had any appetite. I\u2019d go days eating basically nothing because I just wasn\u2019t hungry or the thought of eating made me sick. Occasionally I\u2019d feel physically starving and have to force myself to eat. It\u2019s gotten a little better this last month and I started eating again. \n\nWhy I\u2019m concerned about this now:\nThursday morning, I ate breakfast as usual, Thursday day, I ate minimal snacks (college schedule doesn\u2019t leave time for a proper lunch, so I snack), Thursday night, I get in my first, minor car accident on my way home, no injuries, but it kickstarted my anxiety again. Thursday night I was just so stressed and anxious after the accident, and it was late, so I went straight to bed without eating. Friday morning, I woke up starving, so I went to eat. While I was waiting for my breakfast to cook, I get faint and dizzy. Long story short, I end up on the floor in my room, with a killer headache and a giant bruise on my face, completely disoriented, and terrified. My mom calls the doctor, they say to have the ambulance come, ambulance comes, all my vitals are fine but my blood sugar is 60. Which is way too low. They tell me to go to the ER to make sure I didn\u2019t damage my head at all. It was all fine, but blood sugar was still way too low. They tell my I\u2019m probably hypoglycemic and after doing some research,  I think I have been all my life. Easy fix is to just eat, right? Well for whatever reason, I can\u2019t. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m wondering if the stuff I explained earlier is an eating disorder. Again, I am going to a doctor in a few weeks but I\u2019m just wondering if anyone else has felt this way and how you got through it or if it is a sign of an eating disorder or just any advice.

I need to fix me, it's not their job. I really want someone to just force feed me, so maybe I should go to recovery. But I still hate my body so I guess I need to accept that whatever I look like, I deserve to love myself. If I just try to gain weight nothing about my self-image will change.

Get to the TL;DR at the bottom if you just wanna know about the jeans.**\n\nI\u2019m supposed to be in recovery. I constantly explain what having an ED is like to people who\u2019ve never seen this world in order to spark empathy and understanding in them. I urge\u2014and sometimes have been a bully toward\u2014getting the people I care about into therapy when I see bad behaviours or hear about their unhealthy thoughts. I\u2019m Auntie Recovery.\n\nI\u2019m one of those lifers. My mother starved me as a child according to my behaviour. The easiest bad behaviour to target was being fat\u2014she used to be a semiprofessional ballerina. (I was a *very* sick child with bad lungs, so I was megadosed on steroids. Steroids turn food into mass. I was an immobile lump.) Honestly, my mother fckd both my sister and me. My sister is a registered dietitian and oversees the hospital kitchens in the western division of our region\u2014on a given day she can tell you what 300,000 people are eating. I had/have/will always have anorexia. She brainwashed us both about food (and part of me thinks it\u2019s hilarious. Ba-dum-tsss.) \n\nMy worst was 2014-2017. I won\u2019t give numbers because I\u2019m not evil. After my dad died, I went from having a mild-mannered ED voice to pulling full-on three- to five-day \u201cempty streaks\u201d where I\u2019d consume nothing but milky coffee and water. The weight fell off. In 2017 I actively started dying; my heart and kidneys couldn\u2019t do it anymore. I was suicidal. I was cutting. I was promiscuous and in an abusive-disguised-as-BDSM dynamic with a superior at my workplace. \n\nI escaped that relationship. I finished my second undergrad degree. I went back to my father\u2019s country and family for a whole summer. I got accepted to graduate school. There was a moment of \u201cI am going to get better, goddamn.\u201d\n\nThen I got diagnosed with a whole laundry list of mental disorders. I was put on medicine that made me gain weight by the minute. I used the guise of the extra weight\u2014which to my doctors meant the anorexia was (by clinical definition!) over\u2014to get out of therapy and stop taking other prescriptions. Then I tried to kill myself. A lot. I was sent to involuntary treatment for three months. But it wasn\u2019t food treatment, it was mood disorder and borderline personality treatment. January will be two years of being out\u2014the good news is that I finally have a *real* diagnosis because all of the previous ones were just piecemeal assessments. It means I know my brain and body a lot better than ever before. I\u2019m really good at objectivity. (I don\u2019t have a bias based on a sense of self. Get it! Haha, I\u2019m funny.)\n\nWhich brings me to the jeans.\n\nWeather here is changing and getting significantly colder. A few days ago I popped into my storage locker (all my stuff from my house before I went to grad school in a different country) for sweaters and boots and coats. I haven\u2019t gained so much that loose-fitting things from my skinniest period won\u2019t fit, so I took 80% of my old winter wardrobe back. But there\u2019s no way in hell my rECOveReD (/s) ass is getting back into my littlest jeans. The jeans that were on top of everything else in that Rubbermaid bin. Now I\u2019m absolutely obsessed with getting back into those jeans. I haven\u2019t slept. I want to self-harm after every meal with my boyfriend. I\u2019m thinking about how I can hide not-eating again, and this time manage my heart so it isn\u2019t the weak link this time around. \n\n*This time around.* Because I\u2019m planning to start all over again. I\u2019m everyone else\u2019s Auntie Recovery and goddamn if I\u2019m going to let anybody know that my brain *didn\u2019t recover at all* even if my outside did. Goddamn if I\u2019m going to let this disease kill anyone I love. (Punchline: it can kill me all it likes.)\n\n\n**TL;DR: three days ago I got winter clothes out of storage. JUST SEEING a pair of jeans from my skinniest days has triggered me into a full spiral and threatening years of pretend \u2018recovery\u2019 bc I\u2019ve realized my brain never got better even though my appearance changed. This is made extra emotional because I feel like I have to be the poster child of anorexia recovery.**", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I was unable to reconise hunger anymore, and I remember the horrible cramping I'd get from having some sort of food in my stomach. I've been trying to better my relationship with my body ever since. \nFor the most part, it's been going well, except for last spring-summer (seasonal depression I assume) where I started losing weight and undereating again.\n\nI've been hitting the gym in an effort to celebrate my body for a couple months now, and it has been great so far. I was proud of my progress and how much better I felt in my skin, how I didn't feel frail and cold all the time, or hate my appearance anymore. \n\nHowever, with that more muscular body came a drawback : my hunger grew. At first I didn't mind. I've been exercising regularly, it's normal. Yet, a couple weeks ago, I started eating more and more. Way more than an average woman should be eating. I'd eat even when I'm not hungry, just for the sake of it. Maybe for comfort, maybe out of boredom. Either way, I've been putting on weight ever since (which shouldn't be that big of a deal it's only one kg but it's making me freak out) and most of all I hate myself for losing control like that. \n\nMy first instinct is to punish myself for slipping up that much and stop eating until I get back to \"normal\", or start counting calories again, but deep down I know it's such a slippery slope I'll probably end up where I was in the past summers.\n\nI feel lost. I feel scared.

I felt like I had my eating under control, I still indulged once in a while but I actually had some structure in my meals (if not a meal plan). (As opposed to binge days where I just eat what I find or buy whatever I want)\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve had to have two long hospital stays - of course with very little exercise (plus shitty hospital food which I compensated for by buying candy); as well as some mental health issues, which I tried to \u201cheal\u201d by comfort eating.

I am going to the gym pretty often and I signed up for the weightlifting club. Apart from lifting (still a wee beginner though!) in the gym I run or walk in an incline on the treadmill.

She was quite a bit smaller than I was so I was immediately enamored and jealous. Do I even get to say I have an ED if I\u2019m not as small as her? \nThe next day we were all hanging out before heading back home, she was telling \u2018everyone\u2019 about how she wore a size 00 and can\u2019t find pants to fit her. But she was looking at me when she said it. I noticed when she\u2019d be standing near me she\u2019d pull at her waist. She\u2019s look at me, stretch out and display her ribs and thigh gap. She was very kind so it\u2019s hard to think she\u2019d trigger me on purpose but then I realized I do the same thing- not to ppl I know struggle with ED but when I lay down Ill pull my shirt so that my rib cage shows or twist my body certain ways to talk to people so that my skinniness is apparent.\nIs this something we all have a subconscious need to do? Is this how some of us validate our disorder? I can\u2019t stop thinking about how triggering that was for me- as soon as I got home a purged and popped lax- and I hate myself for ever wanting to make someone feel that way.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Halloween recently came and went so I thought this would be an appropriate time to update.\n\nIve been in recovery for a year and nearly 3 months and I\u2019m finally starting to feel normal. Compared to this time last year I\u2019m a completely different person holy shit. It\u2019s crazy that you can\u2019t see progress until you look back like that.\n\nSo basically I ate whatever I wanted and several servings of it on thanksgiving, then had a candy fiesta with my SO while we watched movies on halloween night. I was able to swat the ED thoughts away like an annoying bug. Last halloween they consumed me, and I broke down and cried when I couldn\u2019t enjoy my halloween treats. \n\nAlso I wore this VERY TIGHT costume that I felt self conscious in but at the same time pretty hot. I\u2019m actually beginning to prefer my recovered body over my sick body which I thought would be impossible. Ive been forcing myself to wear pretty fitting things instead of baggy things the last few months and I guess it\u2019s been working.\n\nAlso - Ive been having awful migraines the past few weeks and I can\u2019t be bothered to make my usual meals and snacks so i\u2019ve been surviving off of peanut butter toast and goldfish crackers, which would have been a huge nono for my ED. I know it isn\u2019t ideal nutrient wise but I just can\u2019t be bothered to torture myself and \u201cbe healthy\u201d when I feel physically like shit. Before I would have spent hours preparing safe foods, now I just eat half a loaf of bread without much thought. It\u2019s a weird type of progress lol.\n\nSo yeah, there\u2019s my little update. I thought it might be helpful for some to hear from someone who\u2019s a bit further along on the recovery train.

I actually might get fat if I recover\n\nb. if I do it's absolutely okay and even healthy/not unhealthy.\n\nNow. People with EDs are people that have a genuine phobia of gaining weight. They are people who engage in **extreme** behaviours to combat that fear. People who routinely starve and harm themselves in very bad and messed up ways to avoid the ultimate outcome of getting \"fat\". People who see wrecking their teeth or destroying their digestion as more desirable than getting fat. So how can you genuinely believe that telling them \"oh well that can actually happen\" is helpful? \n\nImagine someone has a dog phobia. They are so scared of dogs they can't even stay in the same room with a small little tiny pup without screaming and having an anxious breakdown. I do know people like that. Would you either tell them a. \"it's not going to hurt you, try and see, and in the remote and unlikely event that it does hurt we have ways to deal with that without you just shutting it off completely and running away\" or b. \"yeah maybe he's going to hurt you, whatever, you have to deal with it\"? I personally think option a might be better.\n\nYou can't just dismiss our fear with this patronizing attitude and say that we're just slaves of diet culture and have socially rooted fatphobia. Not only it is counterproductive, but it's actually often not true - EDs are so much more complex than that. If you want us to recover, you have to address those fears in a productive way, you have to recognize those fears as valid. You have to convince us that it's very likely we won't get fat, that we CAN eat what we want without necessarily ballooning into infinite mega-obesity, that we don't need to count calories because our bodies can regulate themselves to a healthy place, and we don't need to be worried about extreme outcomes, which IF happen can be treated as well and might not be the end of the world we picture.\n\nAlso, about fat being \"not unhealthy\". I see so many haes activists claiming that you can't link weight to health, because many obese people are actually healthy. This just doesn't make sense from a purely logical standpoint. It's like saying that smoking is not unhealthy because many smokers have not black lungs yet. It's about health risks, not about the present situation. \n\nThen there's the bit about the treatment fat people receive from society. Now, I am not going to deny that fat people sometimes face bullyism and other demeaning shit that must be thoroughly fought, but again, this doesn't mean being fat must necessarily be desirable either, or must be something we people with an ED have to be absolutely okay with. Back to the smoker example, I know plenty of smokers who I love and treat just like anyone else (as long as they don't smoke in my face...), but this doesn't mean I want to be a smoker myself.\n\nI have a very close loved one who died of liver failure. He had liver disease caused by his weight - he was overweight for most of his life and never seriously addressed the issue except when it was too late. He would diet down for a while, his blood tests and other parameters would improve, but then he'd regain all the weight back and his health would worsen again. Ultimately this cost him his life and trust me, it wasn't pretty - it was incredibly painful and sad and I get teary-eyed everytime I think about it.\n\nNow, I do believe that the \"original\" HAES movement was much more positive than what it has been turned into recently. I get the place it came from and I do get that the original message is simply just about loving your body for what it is and not feeling the need to go extreme lengths to force it to change, or adopting unhealthy behaviours to fit some ideal unattainable model. I do agree that you can adopt healthy behaviours at any size and that we as individuals and as a society place an excessive focus on one's appearance and aesthetics. I do believe that everyone at any size needs to be treated with the same respect and human decency, and I do believe that eating disorders are some nasty and miserable shit that makes us have completely distorted beliefs about what is \"good\" and what is \"bad\" or \"unhealthy\". I do recognize that what I personally value in other people is not their body size but their personality, their beliefs, their behaviours, the way they act and speak and just *are*. I don't give a damn about how much my friends weigh and I am not friends with them because they are skinny.\n\nBut I just feel that this positive message has been twisted and transformed into something that is really not the best tool to bring us to a truly healthy place.\n\nIt's a bit of a rant, so sorry if it comes across as disconnected and confused. I also don't want to insult anyone, so I apologize to anyone who feels personally attacked. And of course, I have an eating disorder, so it's not like I have the soundest most neutral mind ever on anything regarding food and weight.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

Think about prehistoric hunter gatherers. Not only fat is the most energy-dense nutrient, so basically the one that gives you the most bang for your bucks, but it would also have been the hardest one to get, therefore the most valuable. Nowadays our main sources of fat are:\n\n-dairy and eggs\n\n-nuts and seeds\n\n-meat.\n\nDairy and eggs would have been rare before agriculture, and good luck feeding an entire tribe with nuts and seeds. So it basically came down to meat, which would have required actually hunting and killing a large animal. It wasn't as easy and immediate as just picking some fruit or eating some plants. \n\nThere is a reason why we love fat. It's not just you being gluttonous.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I\u2019m 30 90kg 5\u201910 so maybe not too badly overweight. My problem is takeaways though. I never used to get takeaways like I do now. Growing up it was a non issue. It\u2019s only when I went through metabolic changes from medication in which made me put on weight did things change. I would have them once a week and always a greasy pizza but I felt like this was too much even then. I always felt so guilty and couldn\u2019t give them up. I spent a lot of money on it. Went on a diet then when I came off I noticed my takeaway count has doubled. Instead of having one every 7 days I have one every 3 days without fail. Give or take a day I always ensure I have one. The only difference is that I have different things now not just pizza. I have kebabs, Indian, Chinese or pizza. For some reason if I went out for a meal or had a McDonald\u2019s lunch or something I wouldn\u2019t count that as my 3 daily takeaway. It HAS to be takeaway for the craving to be fulfilled. Today I had 5 pound in the bank to last me until Friday and knew I couldn\u2019t get a takeaway with what I had left so I actually went overdrawn so I could have takeaway. My gf was pretty annoyed with me and I don\u2019t blame her. I have such a battle with myself in my head every time I want one but know I shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m worried what it\u2019s going to do to me. Also I don\u2019t understand if this is an addiction or maybe an eating disorder or I don\u2019t know. I feel like it could be some sort of psychological thing to do with dopamine for instance. Does anyone know anything about that? Or have any tips? I know I order in more than most people but I\u2019d like to understand the cause first. I feel like my only hope is when I live with my gf it\u2019ll stop or maybe I\u2019ll continue and we will argue about it and break up. Sounds dramatic but it could happen\n\nEDIT to give it a metaphorical comparison I would say it\u2019s like a meter where eating what I got at home is on one side and ordering in a takeaway is on another. It feels like wherever the arrow points I must do that. Last night I was trying to make myself WANT to eat at home. I was going back and forth a lot but eventually the meter fell on takeaway and I felt at that point I caved in because I was tired of trying to reason with myself", "subreddit": "FoodAddiction"}

I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes almost 3 years ago. I have never, ever abused my insulin to lose weight. Until now, when I forgot (but who knows if I actually forgot... maybe I purposely chose not to take it, or to \u201cforget\u201d) to take my night time insulin. And then I spent the weekend with my parents, and we ate a ton of junk, so I figured that I just wouldn\u2019t take my insulin so that I wouldn\u2019t absorb all of the calories that I was eating. What\u2019s the harm right? I\u2019m just making sure that I don\u2019t get fat. \n\nBecause for some reason I\u2019m more scared of gaining weight than going blind or losing a limb at this point. \n\nBut I\u2019m so scared now. My blood glucose was close to 500 mg/dL. Its never been that high. I\u2019m scared that I\u2019m going to go into diabetic ketoacidosis and die. I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ll pass out in my sleep tonight and that I won\u2019t wake up. I managed to get insulin in myself but there was still, still that voice telling me not to take it because I didn\u2019t want to absorb the calories of the pb&amp;j that I\u2019d eaten. I didn\u2019t want to absorb all the food that I binged on. I feel like I get to binge and purge now without throwing up and it\u2019s so sick.\n\nAnd the worst part is that I don\u2019t even feel that bad. A little feverish, a little sleepy, but I\u2019m not puking. I don\u2019t have constant pains. Despite my sugar being sky high I\u2019m convincing myself that I\u2019m fine because I don\u2019t feel sick. \n\nI\u2019m just tired. I told myself that I\u2019d never let my ed take control over this too but I let it. It feels like it\u2019s making more sense to me now and that terrifies me.\n\nAnd you know what the worst part is? I weighed in this morning, and I was terrified that I had gained weight from all that junk over the weekend. Nope. I\u2019d lost weight. So this even \u201cworks\u201d and my horrible, horrible choices somehow feel justified. I hate myself right now and I\u2019m so scared. \n\nSorry for throwing an awfully long ramble up here.

Need some understanding.", "author": "Samantha039", "self_text": " \n\nI was out with a group of friends. They wanted food. We went to a diner. I made it clear that all I wanted was a hot cup of tea (I had reached and only barely exceeded my caloric budget for the day.)  It was fine, I was feeling accomplished. I got the usual jabbings about how\u00a0 \u201cyou can afford to eat\u201d but I was proud to say no thank you and sip my tea.\u00a0\n\nThen the checks came. And the waiter offered my friend a box for her still mostly full plate of pancakes, eggs, and a giant tube meat.\u00a0 The waiter, who I guess was bitter that I didn\u2019t order a plate said that I should eat hers because \u201ccome on babydoll, I\u2019m just gonna throw it away.\u201d\u00a0 And then my friends chimed in about how I should. And like a jury they all decided that I should be eating what she had on her plate. They didn\u2019t stop, going so far as to shove my tea out of the way with the plate. \u201cCome on, just a bite. I wanna see you take a bite of that sausage!\u201d and my no\u2019s were not enough. They wouldn\u2019t drop it. I closed my eyes. I lost. I lost the battle and I ate. And ate. All of it. I ate everything she had on that plate. Soaked it all in syrup and just shoved. I ate what was left on another plate, and the chips on the table. Trying to hide my urgency. It hit my addiction RIGHT in the sweet bulls eye and I was off. Everyone laughed and woo-hooed like they won a game. Like getting me to break was a personal challenge. They don\u2019t know. They don\u2019t understand my struggle. I\u2019m so privately ashamed of it. They don\u2019t understand what they did. And since then, weeks ago...\n\nI. Cannot. Stop.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve been binging to the point of bloat almost every day. Crying at my kitchen counter because I simply don\u2019t have an \u201coff\u201d button and my choice in the matter is gone. I\u2019m up over 10lbs and I simply cannot bare it, and yet, have no brakes to press. I feel like I\u2019m fucking losing it.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve reached out and opened to people about it, but the lack of understanding in their eyes has made me feel so alone. I get responses like \u201cI don\u2019t know much about eating disorders, but if it\u2019s so uncomfortable, couldn\u2019t you just throw it up?\u201d \u201cyou should just and just stop eating after 7\u201d or \u201capply the tools you already have\u201d or \u201cyou can\u2019t even tell you\u2019ve gained weight\u201d.. and if I hear one more thing about \"portion control\u201d I\u2019m going to fucking snap.\u00a0\n\nI even had a friend, who I truly believe didn\u2019t think she was saying anything hurtful, said \u201coh whatever, you\u2019re skinny!\u201d \u201cI have an eating disorder\u201d \u201cwell if it meant looking like that, I\u2019d take it!\u201d... No. No you wouldn\u2019t. I'm in hell. I can\u2019t even fast anymore to offset it like I was. I can\u2019t stop. It\u2019s all I think about. I feel like a goddamn heroine addict. I don\u2019t even want to fast anymore. I just want to not be consumed by food. I don\u2019t want it to feel so good. Because it does. Every time I eat. It\u2019s sweet relief when I take that big bite, or lick that spoon. Like I\u2019ve been holding my breath and that mouthful is a deep breath in.\u00a0\n\nAnd then comes the shame. So. Much. Shame. And the weight gain, just like a happy little cherry on top, the scale blips with a slight uptick every day.\u00a0I'm screaming.\n\nI feel unloaded after writing this. I went to an OA meeting last night an shared a little. But I\u2019m not sure I fit in at that meeting. Maybe because they had their shit together, and I\u2019m driving the struggle bus with a flat tire.\u00a0", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I've never been one to deny food to anyone so I never say anything, either to him or to people who help themselves to my food, I'm fully aware its irrational and kind of fucked up to be angry about someone eating food even after I've offered but it still makes me mad.

It only came across my radar after trying to find info about my sporadic breath holding. \n\nIn the last year, I have lost about half my weight. I am still loosing pounds per week. I never set out to loose weight.  I used to think it was just a change in diet to Gluten Free due to my Celiac diagnosis. But, if I am actually honest, it is really due to stress, trauma, the meds I was/am on, lack of access to food, and lack of money that have made me malnourished.\n\nSince Oct 2018, I am down from 350 lb to 200 lb with more than 50-75 lbs happening only in the last 4-6 months or less. That\u2019s too much too fast. And, I can feel it in my skin and bones and chest as well as see the physical difference and see how easy my body bruises and doesn\u2019t heal from bug bites. I\u2019m in a size 12/14/16 (M to XL) depending on brand and I was a size 24/26/28 (3x to 4x). \n\nIf I can force myself to eat, I get sick if I eat more than about a cup\u2019s worth of food. Even then, my stomach hurt so bad I am doubled over, my body shakes, my heart palpitates, etc. I can literally go all day long on a banana and never notice; and I can go 2-5+ days without an actual meal and not realize it. Like not realize it. That makes no logical sense.\n\nI have alarms set to remind me to eat because I forget or I don\u2019t want to eat or I am not hungry. I set alarms to force me to finish a meal once I start it, even if that takes me until the next day (or two). One day it took me all day to eat 9 ravioli\u2019s and then once it took 3 days to eat 2 tacos and rice and beans. \n\nI logically know less than 1000 calories per day is not healthy. I logically know I have to eat or my thinking isn\u2019t focused and my sleeping is also off and then the cycle starts again. I logically know I have to increase my food intake super slowly and set \u201csilly\u201d goals like- eat 3-5 actual meals in a week or try to eat 2 meals a day for 5-7 days or eat a meal 3 days in a row. I logically know what will work for me as a meal isn\u2019t what others consider a meal. I logically know it\u2019s way better when I take my nausea med that helps me eat and digest food.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t kick my brain out of that false thinking gear that says not to eat. It is as if I have zero hunger hormones. \n\nBut, I know what logically happens as this pattern of not eating correctly and effectively continues. So, I CANNOT let it continue.\n\nWhich brings me to my questions - \n1. Does anyone have experience with it and is willing to offer advice, guidance, etc?\n2. Does anyone know of a good website, aside from the obvious ones, where I can learn about it?", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

{"post_id": "dsenc2", "created_utc": 1573037323, "title": "Request: Seeking support", "author": "EDPostRequests", "self_text": "I became a lot less body conscious during my senior year of high school and I started to like my body. I was an average weight for my height, probably sitting smack in the middle of the weight range that is considered healthy for my height.\n\nIn my junior year of college I went to the doctor and they weighed me. It was the first time I\u2019d been weighed in as long as I could remember. It was also the first time I\u2019d seen myself drop below the xxx (a weight I was happy with). That night I joked that I was torn between wanting to keep it up, or wanting to eat an entire pizza. I guess I unintentionally \u201ckept it up\u201d because I continued to drop. That was the beginning of my winter semester of 2018 \u2014 January/Feb 2018.\n\nFlash forward to my fall semester 2019, August/Septemberish, the first year I would be off of a dining hall meal plan and making my own food again. I was living further from campus but still intended to walk to class. My roommate brought a scale with her for the year. We\u2019d roomed together for the year previously and I knew she had always been a health nut just in that she preferred to eat healthier foods. She\u2019d snack on things like peanut butter toast or veggies of some sort as opposed to chips. But the year previous that didn\u2019t phase me.\n\nI continued to see the numbers drop on the scale when I started to weigh myself. I was cooking for myself again so I was making healthier foods and I was also walking roughly 25 minutes to and from campus every day (and around campus). I wanted to be as healthy as my roommate, or healthier. I wanted to be skinnier than her. It was all pretty effortless, my continuing to lose weight. My goal, that I made \u201cfor funsies\u201d I guess was to drop below what I weighed during my freshman year of high school when I finally quit gymnastics after nine years. I managed to do that before winter even came.\n\nFlash forward to April, I had dropped, and for the most part maintained, my below-freshman year-weight. And then I broke up with my then boyfriend of two years. I lost more weight during the first week after the breakup because I had no appetite. It was an amicable breakup with one of my best friends (we were friends even before we dated for two years) and so it was terribly sad to say goodbye. After that, I made it my goal to stay below my breakup weight. For the most part, I have.\n\nIt was never to the point where I\u2019d restrict and feel totally anxious until June, and that was a slow and steady development. In June, I would still eat out and I would, every now and then, enjoy days where I just guiltlessly ate like shit. Now, I find it difficult to do either. In August, I found out that only a month and a half after my ex and I broke up, he was already in a new relationship. I was absolutely heartbroken and the comparisons I started making to a hypothetical girl are what eventually drove me to where I\u2019m at now. I thought \u201cdoes she have a better body? Is she prettier? What does she look like?\u201d I wanted to be thinner than ever before so that if I ever saw my ex again (somewhat unlikely if not a planned event b/c we did distance) he\u2019d say \u201cdamn, she glowed up.\u201d\n\nI started going for runs more frequently. I wouldn\u2019t entirely restrict but I would somewhat. Now, November 4th, I feel bad for having eaten more calories than my BMR. For reference, I work retail full time \u2014 I\u2019m on my feet 8 hours a day AND I go for a run (sometimes, schedule permitting) either before or after work. Whether I run one or two miles depends on how bad I feel about what I ate during the day. Anyway, case in point, I should be eating AT LEAST my BMR\u2019s calorie intake because I am by no means sedentary. And I feel so bad if I do that.\n\nI want fast food. Like, just a four piece chicken nugget or something. I want tortilla chips with salsa. I want to buy a pack of Oreos. I have begun to feel embarrassed even going grocery shopping because I won\u2019t buy foods over a certain calorie content which really restricts a lot of what I could buy. So there I am, standing in the grocery store, meandering about (sometimes aimlessly) flipping the packaging over and checking the calorie count per serving, often times putting the item back and walking further to see if I can find something with less calories.\n\nThis is such a lonely experience on top of depression and bipolar II disorder that is especially bad this year when I am a recent college grad, working full time retail with my \u201cworthless social science degree\u201d while all of my friends are still students, my ex is with a new girl (and the breakup was still less than a year ago as it is) and I practically don\u2019t even know any of my housemates. I recently got my wisdom teeth out and I thought \u201cI\u2019ll use \u2018only soft foods\u2019 as another opportunity to lose more weight.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m posting this \u2014 I think it\u2019s because at this point I\u2019m so sad and lonely and I just want to say this to someone. I also just want some food and I can\u2019t even bring myself to eat. At this point, I can\u2019t think of anything that actually sounds good. The idea of endless chicken nuggets sounds excellent, but the knowledge that I would indeed feel full afterwards sounds horrible. I don\u2019t know what feeling full feels like anymore. Only bloated. And my constant bloating from my constant undereating makes the cycle worse.\n\nMy therapist and doctor have asked if I want to see a nutritionist and I told them both that I\u2019m not ready to explain this to my parents. That is true - I\u2019m not. But I\u2019m also not ready to stop this for myself. I\u2019m not ready to see my stomach and body go back to what it looked like at this time last year, or the year before that. I just wish I could go back to when this wasn\u2019t even a thought. I want to go back to a time where I could eat pizza, like three or four slices, while drinking a beer without even paying mind to it. I want to do all that and know also that I\u2019m still, like, appealing to men and have some sort of sex appeal", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

The highest calorie snack is 360 if i got one of those halo tops. \n\nWith this method I\u2019ll have to go and get individual servings for the treats but I feel that\u2019s better than keeping a bunch of sugar in the house. The convenience store and Walmart are only a 4 minute drive anyways. \n\nMy plan is to start off with the expectation that I\u2019ll always have a treat. Maybe for the first 3 weeks since that\u2019s the point of forming a habit. Then after that I\u2019ll make it an option if I feel I want the sugar. Deciding now to do atleast 3 weeks should make it harder for me to make myself feel guilty or ashamed for eating treats. If i don\u2019t feel bad I won\u2019t try to binge. It\u2019s probably not the best to eat sugar at night but it\u2019s better than when i typically just eat sugar all day \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nWish me good luck! I\u2019m gonna drink a bottle of water and go hit the treadmill. Then I\u2019m having eggs and oatmeal for brunch. If all goes well i should have a blue raspberry icee around 8:45pm :)", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

What the fuck is it?\n\nI have classes that are right around \"lunchtime\" and everyone brings food into the rooms to eat before the class begins. One kind older woman who's a classmate of mine asks me a lot \"Where do you find the time to get your lunch in before class?\" and I legitimately didn't know how to respond. I shrug it off, say something about having a big breakfast. What I want to say is that I cannot fathom why lunch seems mandatory. \n\nBut I say that, as someone who is highly disordered. Surrounded by normal, healthy seeming people. And I just... don't fucking get it. \n\nand I want kids one day. How the hell am I going to teach them healthy habits if I can't wrap my head around 3 meals a day? Do you set timers? When is an acceptable \"breakfast\" time range? Is a 4 hour gap too much, to little?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've fucked my brain beyond repair and I just want to know what normalcy is.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I have been doing calorie counting for the past year and a half, and although it worked well for my weight loss, I unconsciously caused so much stress to both my mind and body. I'm so obsessed over calories that going over my allotted budget gives me anxiety. Whenever that happens, I do extra workouts just so I can burn the extra calories I ate, even though, in the long run, they don't really matter. \n\nGoing to the store is also torture. On my phone, I've downloaded all the nutritional information of all the fastfood places in my area, and I check beforehand which places I can go to and eat without overshooting my budget. I skip meals just to make the meal fit my budget. Going to the convenience store, it takes me at least 10 minutes to select a snack for the day. It takes me more than a week to finish a liter of milk (health hazard, I know) because I mind the calories. \n\nNow, I want to stop. My period hasn't arrived in 4 months, even after taking some meds. (I'm currently on another set to induce my period). And after some research, I read that too much calorie restriction can shut down some non-critical body functions. And now I wonder: what have I done to my body? \n\nI know it won't be easy, though. I can estimate roughly how much calories a serving of food is. And I am very scared of gaining back weight.

It's actually my first time I deal with a public center - so far I've only had private, individualized and not always strictly ED-related care. I am away from home and so my old therapists are unavailable, but I still need some help. There is some language barrier going on and the professional I am going to meet has been called a general therapist - no idea if he's a dietitian or just a therapist, or both.\n\nI for sure know there's not going to be any inpatient care. If anything it's going to be outpatient, if even.\n\nI am slightly underweight and my old restriction-based ED has morphed into more binging and purging. Although my weight is not particularly low it still lies technically within the medical requirements for AN diagnosis (my old dietitian has recently diagnosed me with AN b/p subtype, which at least gave me a framework to work on). I still have so many concerns and fear, most of them probably stupid.\n\n-I weighed x yesterday and that was my \"true\" current weight. This morning I weighed more because I was bloated. What if I am bloated tomorrow as well and so I weigh more and they don't believe that x is my current weight? \n\n-tonight I am going out with friends and I'm going to eat salty stuff which is going to affect my weight tomorrow and blablabla.\n\n-I am afraid they will make me gain weight and make me fat! (well, duh)\n\n-but I am ALSO afraid they won't make me eat as much as I want to and give me some restrictive &lt;2,000 kcal meal plan which not only won't satisfy me, but will also be psychologically hard to bear - plus my ED brain will jump at eat and say \"see? see? If you eat more than this you're going to insta-turn into a huge ball of fat.\" I am suffering from extreme hunger and, if left completely free, would eat forever. Normal meals feel almost insultingly small. In fact, I nearly cried abouy my (one single) meal yesterday because I thought it was the last time I would be able to eat a meal that large.\n\nSo yeah. Please don't be too harsh - I know these concerns are illogic and ridiculous when seen from the outside, especially because I just really overthink all of it. I have already had them every time I met a new professionals and so far none of them has turned to be true, yet every time it's like Groundhog Day and I can't seem to learn anything.

You\u2019d be surprised how relaxed and less stressed you\u2019ll become. In turn that will make it easier to develop little habits that form into a lifestyle where what you eat and how much you eat and what your next meal will be are not controlling your life and mood. \n\n Tomorrow you wake up. Tell yourself \u201cI can eat whatever and however much I want today. It\u2019s not a cheat day because everyday is a cheat day. Tomorrow, if it comes, will be the same\u201d. You go to the fridge, nothing is off limits. Guess what? You won\u2019t binge because you can just have anything you want later as well. \n\n Please try this and tell me what you think. I used to binge eat to the point of sickness and didn\u2019t even realize I had a problem until recently while doing some self reflection.

Everybody needs to find what works best for them and I respect that. There is no one specific way to recover.   \n\n\nI doubt that this is uncommon when in recovery, but I wanted to discuss here and see if any of you have similar experiences. Since last year, I have somewhat recovered with a few minor relapses here and there, but one thing that made it really easy for me to stick to eating consistently again was being vegan.\n\nHowever, I saw somebody make a comment on social media yesterday saying she doesn't trust people who are vegan and in recovery or something like that, because she believes they are probably still struggling. I am not here to say I agree or disagree with what she said, but her comment made me question myself, and why I'm really vegan. \n\nTonight, I was having dinner at home, and my parents know I stay away from animal products but my dad often turns a blind eye with the mentality that this vegan lifestyle isn't for me and that I can \"cheat\" every once in a while (he is European so the concept of not eating meat is foreign to him). My parents knew I had problems with eating but never addressed it, and I've never been inpatient or \"drastically skinny\" so I don't think they take it seriously. \n\nAnyway, I saw Dad melting some butter into a pan which would be the base for a pasta sauce he was making us for dinner. I immediately panicked and he got pissed off, nearly throwing out the contents of the pan and starting over. I told him not to as it would be a waste and he asked me, \"Do you really think this tiny amount of butter will hurt you?\". I didn't know how to answer, because as a matter of fact, I do, but I know that is only my lingering ED thoughts because technically butter would not physically hurt me. I felt angry at myself because he made me feel guilty and like I overreacted. \n\nI'm curious to know, do you guys think my reaction was the remnants of an ED pattern of thinking? And have any of you gone vegan because you found it easier to recover?", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I usually like bigger lunches and tiny dinners, so right now, I feel so guilty for eating so little during the day because in my head, treating your body bad and starving it leads to binging. I spend all day trying to get myself to eat more, but when night hits, I suddenly WANT all the food - and when I get it, my calories are way higher anyways. Ugh. How do I get out of this mindset?

Could I have a bone density issue even if I\u2019m not underweight? I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m really new to ED stuff and was just diagnosed with OSFED. I\u2019m going into outpatient treatment soon and just don\u2019t know what to expect. I\u2019ve had OCD and body dysmorphia my whole life so it feels kind of inevitable. I\u2019m just having trouble believing I can have health problems if I\u2019m a normal weight. I\u2019m just really stuck on that concept for some reason, but I\u2019ve been learning more about OSFED and the potential health problems it can cause and how it isn\u2019t just me failing at getting to an underweight BMI.

I feel guilty because maybe if I had chosen weirder and more disordered food combinations I could have managed to eat less than that and feel just as full. \n\nIf I eat, say, 1200 or 1300 it's like all of the above but even worse, because there are \"normal\" people who eat those amounts in a day and maybe when I didn't have an ED it happened to me once in a while too (I had no idea anyways, never counted calories).\n\nIf I eat, say, 1500...well you can imagine that. According to my dietitian most of his clients actually lose weight on that, but my ED brain is always like \"lol your dietitian is full of shit, OF COURSE it's a lie, and in any case you would gain on that because of x y and z\".\n\nI guess you can go on and imagine the rest. I can and do force myself to eat these amounts of food, but it feels so INCREDIBLY hard. It feels like an utter waste.

I still really can't bring myself to eat 1800 calories, I honestly can't mentally get past even the 1700 calorie intake that MyFitnessPal recommended to me when I put my activity level as sedentary knowing full well that I'm closer to moderately active.

I\u2019d say that honestly, the hardest things for me are bad body image and triggering comments from other people. \n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been under a lot of stress and my appetite has been crappier and I\u2019ve lost some weight, unintentionally. It\u2019s been hell trying to figure out how to nourish my body while struggling with nausea and other medication side effects, but I\u2019ve done it. It was also really triggering to lose it and see my body changed again. And it opens up a path of temptation. It also makes strangers feel entitled to comment on my body for some reason and that\u2019s the thing that bothers me the most. So all of this situation has been frustrating.\n\nWhen I initially lost the weight, my boyfriend confronted me about it and I explained that I\u2019m really struggling with medication side effects and appetite. He understood and I\u2019ve continued to feed myself and take care of myself and everything has been fine. I\u2019m on a new medication, my appetite feels more normal. It\u2019s all good. \n\nThen on Monday I went to drop off my rent check. While I was walking to the office to turn in my rent check, I saw a maintenance worker who waved at me, so I waved back. Right as I was about to enter the office he said \u201cyou lost a lotta weight recently, you tryin to?\u201d So I said, \u201cexcuse me?\u201d And he repeated himself. I pretty much said \u201cthat\u2019s incredibly inappropriate and makes me feel really uncomfortable.\u201d Then I just walked in and gave them my rent check. \n\nMy ED brain was going crazy though. \u201cOh that means I needed to lose this weight.\u201d \u201cOh he was saying I was too XYZ before.\u201d Whatever. \n\nAfter a good therapy session my ED brain calmed a little bit and I realized how damn weird it is that he would even say that. And the real discomfort for me is that, I\u2019ve never seen this guy before. I don\u2019t know him. Yet for some reason he\u2019s been keeping tabs on my appearance and weight fluctuations enough to notice and feel like he has the right comment on my body. It makes me so wildly uncomfortable thinking about it like that. \n\nI also had a bummer interaction with a girl in a bar. My boyfriend had talked to her earlier and he was introducing me. I complimented her jeans and when she gave me a hug (she was drunk and a hugger lol) she said \u201coh my gosh you\u2019re so much smaller than me I could give you all my old jeans.\u201d And I tried to change the subject, but she went on about how her body changed being really negative towards herself, which was rough. Eventually I had to pretend I needed to use the bathroom to get away. It just feels like since this fluctuation people are commenting on my size a lot and it\u2019s such a bummer. \n\nThe biggest win in all of this is I\u2019m still in recovery and don\u2019t even entertain relapse when people say those things to me. It\u2019s getting so much easier to push them aside and realize they aren\u2019t about me. \n\nAnyone else need to vent?", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I ended up going through a whole tub of laxative powder and because I didn\u2019t have my own income at the time, I had to ask my parents to buy more and they did without batting an eye.\n\nBecause it was a powder that you add to drinks, I knew of the caffeine effect and I would occasionally drink coffee. I started adding the powder to the coffee and I would drink that everyday with a double dose of laxative. Then it became twice a day. My body wasn\u2019t going well and I started have less regular bowel movements.\n\nIt got to a point where my body made the connection of \u2018laxative smell=bad\u2019 and I began to feel nauseous from the smell of the powder, I guess I\u2019m glad my body started having that reaction because I don\u2019t know where I\u2019d be if it didn\u2019t.

{"post_id": "dta7p4", "created_utc": 1573187748, "title": "Goin for 21 days sobriety, baby", "author": "jjanonymous171", "self_text": "Alright, so, this is my first time on Reddit, but I needed to talk about this somewhere, because I'm sick of dealing with it alone. My junior year of high school, I gained 20 pounds in 6 weeks. I don't remember there being any triggers, but nonetheless, it happened. I didn't notice it because it had happened so quickly, but one day, I bent over and felt a roll of pudge on my midsection. This was shocking since I grew up very thin and never used to have any fat on my midsection. I remember running over to the mirror and straight up disassociating for a hot second because my face looked unrecognizeable. I have high cheekbones so my cheeks have always been hollow but lemme tell ya, when I looked in that mirror, I looked like Theodore from Alvin and the Chipmunks.\n\nAnyways, as you can imagine, I made it my goal to lose the weight I had gained. But no matter what I tried,  I couldn't stick to anything. I started getting incredibly insecure about my appearance because my friends kept making comments on how I was getting \"thick\" (I'm 5'2\" so 20 pounds made a pretty big difference in terms of appearance) and the boy I had a huge crush on completely lost interest in me after my weight gain. I got super depressed and began to isolate myself from friends and family. I was so ashamed of what I looked like that the only thing I wanted to do was be alone in my room. But of course, the isolation only made me feel more depressed. Food became my only comfort. That and fangirling on the internet about fiction and celebrities (this part is actually still really interesting to me because I have NEVER been one to fangirl, not even during the Gossip Girl/1D era, but all of the sudden, like, I became obsessive over stuff like that... I'm wondering if there's a link between depression and parasocial relationships, but that's a discussion for another time).\n\nIt's been 3 years since I've started bingeing. My weight has never gone above the initial 20 pound gain but I keep yo-yo-ing up and down and its exhausting. I think that the initial weight gain may have been a hormonal flare or something like that, and the bingeing within the first year or so was due to overrestricting in an attempt to lose weight, but it's become so much more than that. Whenever I feel any sort of negative emotion, my first impulse is to eat. Feeling lonely? Eat. Feeling like a failure? Eat. Feeling stressed? Eat. To be honest though, even when I was thin, I would do this, although it wouldn't happen often and I wouldn't feel much shame about it. Like, one time before my biology midterm my freshman year of high school, I had 7 pieces of challah bread with nutella while I was chatting with my mom. So even though one could characterize that as a binge, clearly I wasn't ashamed of it otherwise I wouldn't have done it in the kitchen right in front of my mom.\n\nI'm in college now and bingeing has become a huge issue. I feel more lonely here since I'm away from home, so I'm more prone to bingeing. Also I have many more opportunities to binge since my roommate goes out quite a bit and there's a Target across the street from me so I can go and buy bags and bags of candy whenever I want to. It's so hard to stop bingeing. I've slowly learned to cope with it though. Last year, if I would binge, I would shut down for the rest of the day. I wouldn't interact with anyone, wouldn't do my chores, wouldn't do my schoolwork, wouldn't even take care of my basic hygiene. I realized, though, that I can't afford to do that, whether I have problems with bingeing or not. I still have responsibilities that I need to acknowledge. I'm kinda proud of myself for learning to live with my eating problems, because I think it shows maturity, but at the same time, I don't want to have to learn how to live with bingeing. I want to stop bingeing.\n\nMy biggest no-binge streak so far this school year has been 12 days. I'm aiming for 21 days right now, and I'm currently on day 2. Eventually, of course, I'd like to lose the weight I gained three years ago, even if it isn't all of it (of course I understand that some of that weight was likely due to going from a teenage girl to an adult woman), but right now, I just want to be able to eat like a normal person again. I'm so sick of being scared to have a snack or a meal because it might trigger a binge. I just want to be able to enjoy life again without feeling like food is controlling every step I take. I'm on day 2 right now, and I really hope I can go further with this. Pray for me, y'all.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

As soon as I opened the wrapper, I regretted it. As soon as I ate the two, I regretted it after learning they were probably 80cal together. I wish I could have puked it out, but I was born with a stupid fear of vomiting, so I\u2019m pretty much walking around with the urge to puke out all that I eat but too afraid due to emetophobia every. Single. Fucking. Day. \n\nThen on my way home I had my first meal of the day, one turkey sandwich with veggies, which was their healthiest option. I told myself that that was enough of a lunch and I wouldn\u2019t eat back when I get home, but my retarded ass did. And everything home is oily because ignorant people who legit have high blood pressure and are extremely overweight cook fattening foods every single day, ruining vegetables. And I\u2019m fucked if eat it, fucked if I don\u2019t. I want to slap them all in the fucking face for ruining what decent nutrition I have left. I just want to puke everything out. I mentally scratch the fuck out of my skin and hate seeing myself every single day. I want to smash all mirrors. I genuinely don\u2019t even know what I LOOK like anymore because my reflection comes out different depending on what mirror I see. For all I know, I look like an obese whale to everyone else because that\u2019s how I see myself. A goddamn pile of lard who can\u2019t resist eating carbs. \n\nAnd no one fucking understands because I\u2019m 119 pounds, and they think I\u2019m doing ok but I\u2019m not. And no one wants to help me healthily lose weight, and my family is even worse because if I tell them I\u2019m finally reached a new low weight, they cook fattening dishes they know I can\u2019t resist and I just lose like I always do because I have no self control. I fucking hate myself and no one has empathy. I try to make jokes about it all on the outside, but no one is picking up on the message that I think this way every day. I\u2019m just a useless black hole of self loathing. \n\nMy only future reprieve is that I\u2019m scheduling most my uni classes next semester coming up soon to end at evening so I can not eat for 80% of the day. I wish so badly that I could just puke it all out. I don\u2019t know how to do this all. I don\u2019t even know if I have an eating disorder but I\u2019m just so fucked", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I wasn't sure where to post this, but I definitely need a second opinion and support. \n\nI've been dealing with eating disorders ever since I was a teen. It always cycled between binging/purging and restricting, with a lot of weight fluctuations and for years I hadn't even realised it was a real issue (the classic \"I'm not skinny enough to have a problem\" mentality).  It's been about 6 years now that I managed to maintain a relatively balanced diet, talked it through with doctors and got help. It's not like every issue disappeared, but my weight was pretty stable, though on the low side, and my nutritional choices were all on the healthy side. Even managed to get a treat now and then without feeling guilty! \n\nNow, I recently got into uni, moved city and am currently going through a much needed break up after a 4 year relationship. He had treated me very badly and I was too afraid to confront him and set boundaries, but I'm learning. However, I realised that I started eating less and less, feel overstuffed with very low quantities of food and I recognise some of the behaviour that I'd left behind. Main thing, the more this goes on, the more I enjoy restricting and right now my immune system is taking the hit. I feel fortunate that I don't have a scale, even though I want to weigh myself.

Unfortunately for me I started gaining weight after that, and obviously my fiance fell out of love because she wasn't attracted to me anymore (I'm definitely never letting that happen ever again in my lifetime) and I guess she felt stuck with me because we had kids. Well in 2017 she took them away from me and moved across the country to live with someone else and I started again, partially to cut weight because I had obviously become too gross to be around but also as a form of self destruction. I tend to get that way when my life destructs.\n\nAnyway that's the backstory so you can understand that this is real and I have a real reason for needing help. I am working on a better body right now because I am tired of being all alone, and have an appointment to get my back teeth fixed as all 4 of the farthest back ones are damaged from the acid (I was bulimic for many years throughout high school and my first marriage before I met my ex and had kids) and I have to lose weight fast but I can't purge anymore due to getting my teeth fixed. I need a support community for other forms of quick weight loss and figured this would be a good place to come asking. I know at least a few of you will be able to direct me to what I need, any sub or even communities elsewhere on the internet are okay just so long as I have people to talk to who understand my path and to pressure me into not fucking up.

It really saddens me but is equaling very frustrating for me as I\u2019ve never truly experienced an ED so I get confused on what to do &amp; I want to help but it\u2019s so complex.\n\nI myself have had &amp; still do fight many mental problems so I\u2019ve always been understanding &amp; relate to similar struggles. But I have only had slight symptoms of an ED before, I think. When at my worst times of depression an darkness I\u2019ve lost a lot of weight and refused to eat an it was rough but It improved with time (it was a breakup that caused it) . I also have had worse body image issues myself but have made a lot of progress and recovery mentally this year. My self love has sort of blossomed on its path to healing an lately I\u2019ve just been determined &amp; doing a lot better then ever, accepting things and growing. still fighting hard &amp; hurting and have lots more to work on ofc...\n\n..But anyways her situation is so much different and far more serious. Some months back she had to be admitted to a hospital because her weight got that low. And I\u2019m so afraid for her ever since. I\u2019ve done a lot of research the past few months because I was afraid of my word choice &amp; triggering her etc. I wanna be a safe spot for her, I don\u2019t wanna make it harder for her. I\u2019m known to be too intense and passionately opinionated sometimes so that\u2019s why I\u2019m even more worried of doing something wrong that could damage her. Im sensitive but equally brutal. It\u2019s why I also have a hard time with friends in general. \n\nSo far I\u2019ve just been emotionally supporting her, telling her I\u2019m there if she wants to talk or needs anything. I haven\u2019t really commented on the weight itself &amp; about eating, obviously prob wouldn\u2019t be a good idea. I\u2019ve been positive &amp; telling her how I like her soul &amp; subtly trying to help her with self love etc. I compliment her a lot and always remind her why I love her. Making her laugh &amp; just talking about other things &amp; stuff like that. I think that\u2019s my best option so far for her to know she\u2019s not alone..\n\nBut I\u2019m not a therapist you know? There\u2019s only so much I can do. And I don\u2019t wanna make her go backwards &amp; accidentally hurt her. I hate to watch her go downhill but only she is truly in control of whether she wants to get better. I can help to an extent but if she isn\u2019t ready what can I do but watch her suffer?? It hurts to see my friend this way an I\u2019m the type of person who always feels there\u2019s more than can be done. In this case it\u2019s like I\u2019m in a cage with no control. \n\nShe has a boyfriend who supports &amp; loves her everyday, &amp; she has some other friends who do the same &amp; that reassures me more. But she tells me she\u2019s mostly vegetarian kinda up &amp; down on it. &amp; I respect her diet. But deep down I feel like it\u2019s even worse for her ED, eating such limited foods &amp; being at such a low weight. Obv I won\u2019t comment or stop her but that\u2019s another worry on my long list of worries I guess.\n\nShe sends me pics &amp; videos sometimes of her craving chocolate &amp; sweets etc &amp; she will send me pics of tasty food she\u2019s eating sometimes which makes me happier sort of. But there\u2019s something so confusing even more to me. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s normal or not with this disorder like I\u2019m still learning..\n\nLiterally every morning I\u2019ll get some type of self hate text or some kind of joke of her saying like \u201cI can\u2019t weight to lose 20 more pounds today\u201d or \u201cI wish I looked like this\u201d &amp; sends me a pic of this disturbingly small photoshopped girls. Like she follows all these unrealistic models who clearly have EDs as well. I\u2019m not super informed on the topic but I think I read that some people look at pro-ED stuff in a way they think helps them? \n\nIt\u2019s scary as her friend to see that but I guess her mindset is just in some broken patterns?? I feel not educated enough but in a way im veryyy exhausted too. I have put so much time into learning but her negativity is slowing down my own progress. Like for example just every single time she sends me memes or we\u2019re having a conversation she\u2019ll randomly say like \u201cI\u2019m gonna lose so much weight today\u201d or like \u201cI am so ugly lol\u201d &amp; even when I post body pics of myself on snap or whatever, she\u2019ll  comment and get all sad saying \u201c I need to not eat today.\u201d And that makes me really sad ...I feel guilty when I try to be proud of myself because she just keeps making those self loathing jokes. SO MUCH. I keep telling her as carefully as I can how making the self damaging jokes stops healing and makes it hurt more. \n\nShe\u2019s aware of the problem &amp; in her mind wants to fix it but I haven\u2019t seen her take any action into doing so?? Like no joke every single day when I wake up to the negativity I will send her paragraph after paragraph or voice texts on why I like how she looks &amp; why I care about her. I tell her she deserves to heal and be caring to herself. \n\nBut part of me feels that she wants the attention more than growth itself. Hearing her put herself down day &amp; night is putting my own mind in a backwards mindset. I\u2019m slowly starting to say these things to myself again because she says it THAT much. Which is so bad for me because I\u2019ve battled self hate for years. I can\u2019t have that kind of energy around...but I still care for her..I just need to take my own happiness into consideration as well. \n\n&amp; when I say everyday I mean every single god damn day. I try so hard to be there &amp; bring her up but she won\u2019t even try to stop being less negative in the SLIGHTEST. I give her little ideas everyday like being grateful &amp; mindful &amp; having self care days &amp; saying kind words to your mind. She never listens, an I never force her. I always come about it in an open way &amp; that it\u2019ll all her choice. \n\nIt got to a point where I told her it\u2019s impacting me &amp; that I need her to at least please not send the self hate snaps to me every morning. I suggested like sending it with something different &amp; more positive or talking about other stuff. But she won\u2019t stop at all.

I don\u2019t show it but it gets infuriating because I ask her to please not send me the self attacking jokes so much &amp; she doesn\u2019t even consider what I say. She just does it over &amp; over &amp; over. &amp; it\u2019s entraining back into my mind, it\u2019s like everyday I have to undo the energy she casted onto me to get back to where I was. \n\nThe weirder part is that when I don\u2019t compliment her &amp; send her those paragraphs, she gets like lowkey upset? Like she will send more &amp; more until I acknowledge it &amp; everything. Recently I\u2019ve just been changing the topic when she says it &amp; trying to completely distract her but my efforts are useless it feels like. \n\nMy heart gets really firey &amp; aggressive when I can\u2019t come to solutions so I\u2019m in fear for what I\u2019m gonna say soon lol.

I\u2019m so lost tbh. I don\u2019t even know. It\u2019s gotten my mind building this bad frustration towards her. When they won\u2019t even cooperate in the slightest but force me to hear their endless negativity, it\u2019s enraging. \n\nI love her but she\u2019s draining my energy and killing my vibe really reallllly bad. At this rate I\u2019m gonna completely spiral into my past self. Am I wrong to feel this resentment deep down for her now? my brain just wants to tell her to shut up and decide to change or she will be stuck there forever. I won\u2019t say that but ugh...I feel guilty but I just can\u2019t freakin take it. I can\u2019t support someone who wants to stay where they are...\n\nShould I distance from her until she\u2019s ready to heal more?

Recently with Halloween, we had a lot of candy in the house. I've also been depressed. I binged a lot and felt ashamed. I'd do it mostly when my partner was out but due to misophonia I'd then also have some when she was cronching candy to keep the noise of her eating from bothering me.\n\nThe other day I mentioned that I felt like I'd been eating a lot more candy than her and I asked her if I should stop and leave her the rest (hindsight: not a good Q) in fairness. She paused for a minute and then awkwardly said yes. Since then, whenever she eats candy I've been feeling really bad and ashamed about myself, about binging, and I've needed to leave the room, usually going into my bedroom to cry and lay in bed for a few hours. I don't think she's put 2 and 2 together because I've just generally been depressed. I think part of why I'm feeling bad is because I can see the bowl of candy and know how much is left and it just makes me realize how much I binged in just a few days, and it will last her weeks.\n\nHow can I talk to my girlfriend about the reaction I'm having to her eating the candy around me? I think I already make her feel bad about eating around me with my misophonia (though chewing gum helps, I have IBS so it can trigger that) and I don't want her to somehow feel like she's doing something wrong. I don't want her to develop a bad relationship with food because of trying to accommodate my misophonia and disordered eating or feeling bad because of the effect it has on me... But I also feel like I should talk to her about this because there's got to be some solution that won't make her feel bad but won't trigger me either.\n\nTL;DR my gf eating her share of the leftover candy reminds me of my binge and eating my entire share already, I feel ashamed, and idk how to talk to her about this really specific trigger without making her feel like she's done something wrong", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

For reference, I\u2019m 27 and recovered from anorexia some 5-6 years ago.\n\nI work in an open office space, which is nice, except for lunch time. We all tend to eat at our desks, which took a little getting used to in the beginning because I\u2019m just never going to be crazy about eating around people I don\u2019t know well.

I\u2019m very passionate about cooking and trying new things with my wife. I\u2019m vegan and we\u2019ve been exploring new restaurants and markets and recipes and having tons of fun. But outside of the \u201csafe\u201d context of my home and friend group, in a place where I can\u2019t simply get up and leave, and where no one knows about my past with anorexia, it\u2019s completely overwhelming.\n\nThis bit is only somewhat relevant, but I\u2019ve long had suspicions that EDs can go hand in hand with food-related misophonia, which I struggle with occasionally, sometimes intensely. Possibly because my coworker already stresses me out with her constant offers and discussions, and because she simply is a very noisy eater, I\u2019ve gotten to the point of sweating and feeling my heart race sometimes when we eat lunch in our otherwise very quiet office, or when she has snacks throughout the day.\n\nI feel completely ridiculous for how much this has been affecting me, but I suppose we all simply spend a huge chunk of our time at work.

But she hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, and I pride myself on being professional, and don\u2019t want to alienate her.\n\nI know that therapy is always a good idea, but I simply don\u2019t have time for that right now. Maybe in a year or so, but I just wouldn\u2019t know where to fit it into my current schedule. I guess what I\u2019m asking is \u2013 has anyone had similar experiences?

I'm so disappointed in myself. After years of thinking I'm pretty much recovered from all ED, I've just continued to destroy my digestive system while being in denial. I tried to remove the stigma of \"bad\" foods like desserts and chocolate and sweets. But it's gotten to the point where if I eat any sweets I'll inevitably feel guilty and skip actual meals and exercise compulsively to undo the damage. This combined with not getting necessary nutrition has made me reliant on laxatives to go to the bathroom and up until recently I was taking them up to 4 times a week in a miserable cycle of feeling bloated anytime I ate anything at all and clearing out my entire system. Oh but it's okay because \"I don't starve myself anymore\". /s\n\nI decided I needed to repair my body once and for all. My plan has been to cut out all desserts, cut out laxatives, and cut out exercise for the time being. If I can't have desserts then I have to eat real food. And if I can't exercise then I can't compulsively try to rid my body of everything. \n\nThis plan spiraled into even worse problems right from the start. Not being able to exercise has fueled my fear of gaining weight and so I've been restricting hard and running my body at a deficit. Not eating desserts makes me think about the day I can eat them again and I fantasize about it 24/7. \n\nAfter about 10 days of sticking to my plan, yesterday I woke up really faint and decided I would just have a \"maintenance\" day. I would eat my TDEE and eat healthful foods. Then they had donuts at work and I, being on a more \"relaxed\" diet, decided to have one. Well didn't that make me feel guilty and so I decided I would work out later. My workout turned into an hr of cardio (just walking, too faint to run) and an hr of weights. When I got home my boyfriend had chocolate-covered blueberries on the counter. And after a really healthy dinner I decided one small handful of chocolate wouldn't hurt. \n\nOne handful turned into 3 handfuls turned into half a family-sized bag of Cadbury eggs and like 10-12 Halloween chocolate bars. I stopped myself from eating a cupcake but by then the damage was done. I fucking binged like 2000+ cals of chocolate in like 20min. All from thinking one donut would make me fat. Wtf is wrong with me. I'm so disgusted in myself and I feel so sick and my heart is still palpitating the next morning. \n\nThe one silver lining from this whole fucking fiasco is that about an hr after my trainwreck binge, my stomach was churning and within minutes I was running for the bathroom. All without laxatives. So yeah, high five to digestive reparation. Why can't I be fucking normal.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I was worried I didnt look healthy but lowkey was glad I was losing weight. I have always been quite skinny (and actually rn I'm underweight)  so at first I didn't realise I lost weight but when people pointed it out I became super aware that I had lost weight and body fat and this is where my brain goes at war with itself because,\u00a0 while I was worried I was looking unhealthy and I looked at myself in the mirror and wasn't pleased with what I saw because i don't like to look like a stick and would actually like to have some curves, I was happy I was losing weight. so this year I've gone in retrospection and realise some behaviours that go along with this. like for example, one time, my ex boyfriend did some bad shit, it make me feel real sad, that day i just had breakfast and I felt really sad I didn't even felt hungry but when it was dinner I did get hungry but didn't wanna eat anything and once the hunger stopped I felt like i really accomplished something because  I had surpassed the hunger. this episode was on November/December last year, i'm not really sure, but that was the first time I was actually aware I was doing it. now I've been more aware of it, that when I'm hungry and I don't eat but the hungry feelings passes i feel like i won somehow.recently I saw a thread on Twitter about eating disorders and how they are not what media says they are and they manifest in different ways and\u00a0 i thought i had one (eating disorder) but then I realised I might be faking it because i've stopped eating, not full stop, but in small amounts. my routine is I have breakfast,\u00a0 go to work where my coworker gives me food because she says I'm too skinny then I go to my house on lunch break because I work close by and I have to eat because ever since I went vegetarian my mum makes me eat and complains when I don't, and then when I come back from work I\u00a0 just dont eat because i feel like I've had too much food during the day, I tell my parents I'll cook something later but i don't do it because i never planned to in the first place since I'm feeling guilty i already eat to much throughout the day, I just have beer since that makes me full but it's liquid. I've been doing that before I started reading about eating disorders but now that i'm aware of it I feel like I've been doing it more, or maybe now I'm just aware of it, I'm honestly confused  and don't know what I'm doing with myself.  also i gotta say I've never eaten too much, as I've said I've always been skinny and my mum used to ration our amounts because she didn't want us to be fat so I'm used to eating very little and get full with little amount.I guess I'm not asking anything specific but just what are your thoughts about all this and do u feel like i'm faking it because I feel like ever since I started reading about eating disorders I've like, self diagnosed, and now i'm not eating just because I'd like to fit in (?) and i feel really guilty about it because there's people with actual eating disorders and i'm just being dumb\u00a0 i'm sorry for this", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

{"post_id": "du2evp", "created_utc": 1573336677, "title": "BED is fascinating", "author": "TanAnteras", "self_text": "Hey everybody,\n\nJust finished a multi-thousand calorie binge, and wanted to come here to share thoughts. Luckily it ended before it got to the point of great physical pain. The mental part, that will still come in the next days. I do this every week/every two weeks. Haven't gone without a binge in every two weeks since, cannot even remember.\n\nBut I am not here to feel sorry for myself or ask for help. I want to share a thought, maybe it resonates with you. It just hit me like a ton of bricks. This whole thing is so strange to the point of being awe-inspiting. \n\nSo, let's think about this BED for a moment.\n\nI, as I'm sure many of you too know all the physical risks, nutrition facts (saying this very seriously, I might have spent thousands of hours studying nutrition in my free time, yet all the knowledge in the world doesn't seem to change it), like sugar being harmful, we know the pain, the guilt better than anyone. We lose money, we isolate, we hate the weight gain, and we don't like to look ourselves in the mirror, we ruin our lives with this behavior. And, we do it all the same. Over. And over. \n\nIsn't it amazing? How are we capable of this absolutely self-destroying behavior. The absurdness of it all is pretty funny actually. Today, before I picked the first bite, which I knew was going to be a binge, I checked in with myself. You do know it before-hand, don't you? The jitters, excitement, and, maybe even slight uneasiness and horror. I asked, in my mind, do you want to do this merry-go-round once again, for the god-knows which number of binge it was this time. I said to myself, yes, I said yes to depression, self-hatred and hopelessness, just to get my bite (many bites) of whatever drug I craved. It is amazing to me. Generally I am a happy person, living meaningful life, not perfect but life worth living. In no other area do I harm myself so.\n\nI cannot understand it. It makes no sense to me why the part of me that wants to binge, seems to have ultimate power in these moments. It is a pure mystery to me. I've tried so many ways. Meditation, 12-step groups, theraphy, mindfullness, deep-breathing, accountability buddy, gratitude lists, action plans, excercise, and no-excercise, making videos of myself in the moment of last physical pain from binge, warning myself from the past not to do it again, distraction, self-care, reading Brain over Binge (great book!), listening to podcasts and applying the tricks to my life.\n\nI know my triggers. I avoid them pretty succesfully. I don't restrict. I eat healthy and enjoyable foods everyday and feel satisfied by them. I have meaningful relationships. \n\nAnd yet, when the urge hits, so far the track record says, that I can hold it back for some hours up to maximum of couple of days.\n\nFor me personally, there is no specific trigger. I can have a bad day, good day, hungry, satisfied, bored or feeling awesome. Proud. Devastated. Gleeful. Tired. Doesn't matter.\n\nAnd I cannot stop.\n\nI've been able to set goals and succeed in any other part of my life except this one. It is mind-boggling, mysterious, fascinating, and extremely mentally taxing phenomenom.\n\nAs I'm writing this, I feel a sense of otherness to my body and mind. In a curious way. I get more curious. What is the part of myself that I do not yet understand. I am not expecting a magical key that will one day handed to me through spiritual enlightenment. Wouldn't mind that either to be honest.\n\nI do hope that each.. episode, leads me to a deeper understanding. I think they do. Progress is unfortunately a bit slow. But until then, I'll keep fighting. We only lose if we stop fighting.\n\nThank you for letting me share these thoughts. I wish you, dear fellow binge eater, hope for the future.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

(I've never made myself throw up!) Besides being so scared that I'll always have an unhealthy relationship with food, my friends are worried about me. I know that I look thin, but not unhealthy (meagre?). And it's not just a delusion, people who I share a locker room with have confirmed that. I'm just terrified that others will think I look too skinny and unhealthy under the oversized clothes I wear and think of me as unlovable and ugly when I'm just thin...

When I got there the boy I liked looked me up and down, turned to his friend and  loudly whispered \u201cfat b****\u201d. They laughed and left and I wished I could fall through the floor. When I got home that night I cried because I was a shy nerdy girl and I couldn\u2019t imagine what I had done to make him say that. \n\nI thought I used food to control my emotions but really I was controlled by food. \n\nEvery night when my family had gone to sleep I\u2019d pull out thousands of calories from underneath my bed. I\u2019d buy it after school from the grocery store, a different one each time because I feared the cashiers would recognise me and see exactly where all this food went - my cheeks, my waist, my thighs. \n\nI\u2019d stuff my face until my stomach ached and the nausea crept up my throat and I was sure I had abused myself enough to truely be the beast people told me I was. \n\nOver the past year I\u2019ve lost enough weight to now be on the low side of a healthy BMI. I\u2019ve basically switched to a restriction ED, largely driven by the comments of people around me. \n\nAnd today the boy who called me a \u201dfat b****\u201d asked me out for dinner after over a year of not seeing each other. He said I looked great and he wondered why we didn\u2019t talk more in high school. I wanted to break down and yell at him for ruining my self esteem. I wanted him to know how many nights I had spent crying over his careless words. But instead smiled and said I was happier leaving the past in the past.\n\nI don\u2019t know why I wrote this, I guess I\u2019m just frustrated with how the world works. I wish I could have enjoyed high school, I wish people could have seen more to me than just my weight, I wish I didn\u2019t think about food constantly. Oh well", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I was 17.5 stones when I was 16, and lost 4.5 of it fairly easily with weight watchers. My mum did over feed me somewhat - she was always restricting then binging, but I think we shared the same issues overall. \n\nWhen I was 18 I had my first run in with serious depression, and was eventually diagnosed with BPD, then Bipolar. The depression marked the start of the binge eating and from there I learned how to purge with laxatives and then bulimia. Bulimia and dieting and antidepressants were my life until around age 31.\n\nWhen I stopped throwing up, I still couldn't control my eating. I was still eating too much, and I slowly began to put all of the weight back on. At 33 I'm back to square one. I don't purge anymore, I don't have the energy.\n\nI was then diagnosed with ADHD and depression. Most of the meds made me ill and nothing seems to help the impulsive binging. But I also know that it's emotional, too. I feel trapped in a vicious cycle of feeling disgusting, ashamed, depressed, not wanting to leave the house because of the binging and my self image - and then binging again for the comfort. It's one of the only things I find that mind numbing, dissociative comfort in - but it's a short lived relief.\n\nIt's mostly takeout food, and I can't afford to keep doing it. I hide the packages but my partner knows and he worries. It's making me feel so low I don't see the worth in day to day living. I'm stuck. I want to try, I really do. I hate myself.\n\nIf anyone has any advice on where to start with mindfulness techniques or...anything really, I'd appreciate it. I buy books but...ADHD. Plus, it's hard to face. It's different when you're speaking to people who know what you're going through I guess. \n\nI really admire you all for bring part of this group and looking after each other, sharing your stories etc.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I think I have always been prone to binging because I have a naturally large appetite, and trying to stave it off has lead to extremely difficult to ignore hunger signals.\n\nRecently, I decided to go completely whole foods plant-based, for both health and environmental reasons. I'm not here to parade veganism or any of that. Only that since I have been eating whole foods, I have been eating to total satiety, and it has totally eliminated (for the most part) my need to binge! And in doing so, I've lost 5kg in the past month without really trying.\n\nFor anyone interested I normally eat like this:I will sometimes eat a 600-800 calorie late breakfast (e.g. bran flakes mixed with home-made oat-muesli with a banana, and a wrap with hummus, cucumber and tomato), but then I will last the entire afternoon until dinner where I can then eat another large meal (I've been loving a roasted sweet potato, with a giant salad with some mixed beans and chickpeas, plus a wholemeal bread roll and some guac or hummus - around 400 calories), and even a little pre-bed snack like a banana with nut butter. Or I'll eat a smaller breakfast, and have a light lunch of brown rice with some veggies and beans, or dark rye thins with almond butter and banana.\n\nBut to anyone struggling with their hunger signals, extreme appetites, and binging in general, I HIGHLY recommend at least trying a whole foods (not necessarily vegan) approach. So really loading up on wholegrain, legumes, starches, and fruits and veggies. I think it has a lot to do with the increased fibre content of all of my meals, and feeding the body nutrient dense, natural whole foods. \n\nWhen I do feel any need to binge, it is SO much easier to recognise that it is a primal and unnecessary part of my brain telling me to do so, and very easy to simply listen, ignore, and move on. The only time I have binged since adopting this lifestyle was when I was extremely hungover, and had all sorts of weird processed, non-wholefoods in my body...\n\nThanks for reading, I had to share this somewhere because I've been so much happier since doing this, and really hope it can help somebody who is in a similar predicament to the one I was in not very long ago!", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

(After eating at a birthday-party everything I could find, even meat while Im a vegetarian, I drove in the middle in the night to a supermarket to buy and eat a whole package of pancakes.)  \n\nI want to stop binge eating so desperatly, but every attempt failed in the past. That's why I want to ask you guys for some tips. First some background information.\n\nI have been sensitive for addictions my whole life. I got diagnosed with ADD a few years ago, so Im more impulsive and extreme then the average person. Which, in my case, means that if I like something I want to do it all the time and I can't stop. For example I have never been able to drink 1 or 2 alcoholic drinks: it always ends up with two bottles.\n\nSame with food. If I eat one cookie, I want the whole bag. Sometimes I can control myself. But most of the times when I eat one unhealthy thing, I end up eating like shit all day. Allthough Im a general happy person, I eat to numb my feelings. And because it's a habit. Celebrating something? Food! Feeling sad or bored? Food! Being with friends or family? Food! Food is in my mind the solution for everything, although I rationally know it's bullshit.\n\nBinge-eating episodes always followed up with (crash)diets, because I hate seeing the number on the scale going up. Lately, thanks to my therapist, I quit the diets. But that means I eat like shit most of the time and feel so sad and lethargic.\n\nThe hardest thing for me is that with a food addiction, there is no easy rule to follow and every blog and book is giving other advices. I quit drinking 4 months ago and that was way more easy because I just could say to myself: never alcohol again. But with food it's much more tricky, because you HAVE to eat. But what and how much is debatable. \n\nI have a normal weight, but my ideal weight is 4 kg lighter. But for now my main goal is quit the binge-eating and just have a normal, relaxed relationship around food.\n\nMy main questions:\n\nIs it smart to avoid trigger foods like quit eating sugar (cause my binges are mainly on carbs and sugar) or is it smarter to eat everything \"in moderation\"? And if so: HOW?\n\nDo you have any tips on how to get this going and especially: how to stay on track?\n\nIs it smart to log your food/count your calories? To weigh yourself? Or does this make the whole food/diet-obsession even worse?\n\nAny tips or experiences are very welcome!\n\nThank you!", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

Thanks. \n\nSince I moved far from home my birthdays are a bit hard, from people not coming, my friends are so far and everything is food and is freezing outside. My bf, also feels the same about his birthday and I encouraged him do be selfish and follow his idea, of what would make him actually happy, so he traveled to visit his best friend that is so far in Honk Kong. \n\nFor this year I didn't want to plan anything, I was too exhausted about life. And one of the guys of my group in the uni that has bd 2 days after totally overshadowed my birthday and made plans for all 3 days of the weekend, all things I hate, even after I mentioned it was also my birthday, and showed no intention to maybe find something mutual. In my actual day we only watches movies and still restricted, only celebrating with a platter of fruit.\n\nI told my bf I would like to do something small, maybe visit an animal sanctuary near by.  He, as amazing as he is, planed a surprise for me. A birthday in the Jumphouse I wanted to go for so long (he is injured and should not stress his ankle), and a few friends joined, I am close to 30 but I always dreamed as a child with this birthdays in the bowling places or such, but could not afford it. This was so perfect. I had so much fucking fun, like a child, there was a massive platter of fruit instead of cake (we both are vegan so also that) and I did not passed out cos I ate some fruit before. Then I came back home and more friends joined and we made vegan pizzas sat and have a chat. I needed that, I was so happy, I had some pizza and brownies and chips, no binging and no guilt. He is so amazing, and he also had so much fun even with his injured ankle, I love him so much. Trying to do a flip to land on the air mattress and have a equilibrium-bar-fight beats any clubbing.   \n\n\nI hope you all a great birthday whenever it is!", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I've been in and out of therapy, ranging from underweight to overweight. This is what worked for me and it won't work for everyone, and this method doesn't even work for me sometimes- there is no one size fits all solution. But I promise that it does get easier the longer you try and those off days do get further and further apart. So these are the things that helped me stop binging.\n\n\n\n1. When I got the urge to binge, I would say my feelings out loud and why I was feeling them. For example, \"I want to binge because I'm lonely, and I'm lonely because I haven't left the house in a few days.\" Sometimes there would be no reason for the way I was feeling and I would acknowledge that as well. \n\n\n\n\n2. After acknowledging the feeling, I would do my best to remedy the cause. If I was lonely, I would call a friend and arrange to meet up, but if depression was particularly bad and I couldn't bring myself to interact I would at least go to the local library. This was a very popular place for me to go because I love reading and you obviously can't eat in a library.\n\n\n\n\n3. I ate more. I know this seems counter intuitive but it's crucial you eat your TDEE if you want to fully stop binging and fill your diet with a lot of protein. This is probably the hardest step of them all and it takes a while to achieve and is especially hard to do alone. Reach out to friends, family you trust, a therapist- I find that eating disorders are a lot like addiction and outside support is invaluable. But I understand that many of us definitely aren't ready to do this, and that's okay. Progress is progress no matter how slow.\n\n\n\n\n4. I didn't allow myself to purge no matter what. If I did binge, I absolutely had to keep it down. This decreased my binging hugely and broke the b/p cycle eventually, but it took a good week of nonstop binging for me to stop.\n\n\n\n\n5. I took routes that avoided as many shops as possible, especially those in which I would regularly buy binge food in. I stayed out of my kitchen as often as possible. Out of sight, out of mind- or at least not so convenient that I can impulse buy a bag of doritos that leads to an uncontrollable binge. I went into stores with a shopping list and only got the things on the list, and made sure I walked right to the point without walking through endless aisles of binge triggers as much as possible. \n\n\nThese are the things that have helped me, and I really hope even one of you benefits from them.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I'm not dieting or something. I ate a cheeseburger and almost started crying I felt so guilty. She ate a cheeseburger and also almost started crying she felt so guilty. We're both struggling.

Eventually, I learned disordered eating all on my own, and kept doing this until a few years ago, with some relapses. What she gave me included osmotic laxatives and bulk laxatives (each of which are not harmful) but also stimulant laxatives (which are not only harmful, but potentially carcinogenic and certainly not for children). I've gone to the doctor and found out that the eating disorder and almost lifelong laxative abuse have damaged my gut, and it may be permanent. The only treatment? bulk and osmotic laxatives (long story short, it may be permanently paralyzed). Even though these aren't unhealthy, because I have to take them every day, I started weighing the healthiest options for psyillium husk and miralax- the least amount of sugar, the least amount of calories. \n\nThen, how I could bring myself to eat them every day, and the lowest calorie baked goods and liquids because I couldn't stomach them in water. The wood chip texture disgusted me. Already, looking at the least amount of calories for taking these has triggered more intrusive thoughts. but then, so does the usage of the medications themselves. I associate the taste and texture and smell SO strongly with horrible events from my childhood and how disgusting they were and how they made me feel. She put them in my drink, and she even baked them into muffins (she told me she did this, I am not just imagining it), and now to stomach them, I'm baking them into muffins. I'm putting them into drinks. They made me feel like I was being punished, because I ate something I shouldn't have. Because I was fat. Because my mom dug through the trash and found evidence that I ate something I wasn't supposed to. And she noticed I seemed to be gaining weight. \n\nI'm starting to want to purge again.  The best I can do is to binge and then tell myself I deserve to be fat, and distract myself so I don't purge. And the entire time, I'm mad at myself for doing this and for damaging my body. But then, I'm mad at my mother for teaching me to damage myself. It is hellish.

I am underweight, albeit not that much, and I am suffering both physical and psychological symptoms. Cold all the time, unable to concentrate, obsessive and ritualistic, fatigued, etc. You know the usual stuff.\n\nThe single worst symptom though is extreme hunger. I have been this hungry only during the very worst phases of the eating disorder. The hunger is absolutely wild and uncontrollable and often keeps me awake at night. The thoughts about food are so loud that I want to cry. Sometimes I can't tolerate them anymore so I snap and binge, and during these binges the only limit is my stomach capacity - I can easily eat thousands of kcal in a single sitting and never feel satisfied. Ever. I am not exaggerating.\n\nIn a few days I will be seeing a new dietitian (as well as a new therapist) and I guess he/she will probably prescribe me a meal plan. My concern, though, is that a meal plan is just not going to be enough.\n\nSee, right now I only make one meal a day and try to make it as large as possible. I am not going to share the exact caloric amount - it's not extremely low and, while still being less than what a normal person eat during a day, it's still enough to survive and not lose anymore weight. And I am already FORCING myself to eat that amount, having to deal with the horrible guilt that comes afterwards. This arrangement is the best way I have found to get some satisfaction.\n\nBy the way, this meal not only includes protein but also a decent amount of fat. It's been very very hard to bring back some fat into it because I kept telling myself \"why do you have to choose the full-fat option when you could have the low-fat one, eat more of it and save calories?\", but over time I've come to grow more comfortable over it. I know I need to eat fat, so I try to force myself to do it even though I don't want to.\n\nI guess a meal plan will include \"normal\" meals. Yet normal meals feel insultingly small to me. I wouldn't even see them as a snack. Anything smaller than huge is completely useless, it would just make me feel worse because not only I would have my fears validated (\"see, you have to restrict, the very dietitian tells you that with this meal plan!\") and wouldn't get even the tiny satisfaction I get now from my large evening meal, but I also wouldn't have the safe blanket of being under a certain caloric amount. Basically it would be a shitshow from a psychological and physiological standpoint.\n\nPlus, it's like anytime I eat outside that evening meal the floodgates open and I get even MORE hungry. My brain starts screaming \"omg there's food. Let's get ALL of it RIGHT NOW.\" and so a. Either I get even more scared of eating during the day or b. I binge.\n\nYet I realize that I need some help, and can't just persist in these behaviours. I also am aware that some of this hunger is due to the fact that the eating disorder has completely destroyed my hunger cues. But the last time I've tried to speak to my dietitian(s) about this extreme hunger I've mostly been met with poor empathy, if not contempt, or at best with a simple \"having normal consistent meals will make that go away\". Yeah, it might happen in the long run, but what do I do in the meantime? How can I stick to the meal plan, which is going to be restrictive for what I want right now, and not go crazy and/or ending up binging in the meantime?\n\n(this is a copy of the last message I sent, but I added a few lines.

I thought when I lost weight, when I would finally be skinny, every other flaw would become insignificant. Background noise. But today, weighing in at 100 pounds, I still found myself this morning looking at my skin, thinking it was so ugly and horrific. \nI gripped the rolls of fat when I sat down. I looked at my thighs and wished they were just a little bit smaller. I still want to cry when I look at my arms. \n\nI deprived myself of so much, set such strict rules for myself, spent so many nights sitting in front of my mirror binge eating when I felt like such a hopeless failure for not losing weight, and it all feels like it was for nothing. The scale says exactly what I wanted it to, what I\u2019ve been working for, it reads the number that I thought would change my life.\n\n\nThe weight loss makes me feel happy when I compare my body now to what it was then. But I do not wake up every day feeling like a fairy, I do not go about my day thinking \u201cI know I look good in this outfit\u201d. I wake up praying that the scale is lower. On really bad days I wear XL hoodies to hide my body. My life is not completely swallowed by these disordered thoughts, but they still take up a large fraction of my head. \n\n\nWhen I think of things I look forward to, the first on the list is losing. Lose lose lose and lose and keep losing. I wonder where I will stop myself and say, this is good. This looks good. The number 100 was the point I thought I would say \u201cthat\u2019s enough, I\u2019m happy like this\u201d. But I looked in the mirror and felt disappointment. This isn\u2019t even close to what I wanted. And then the rational thoughts kick in: do you want to keep losing until you weigh absolutely nothing? \n\n\nI look at the girls online with curves and think they are beautiful. I want my body to look like that. \nThen I look in the mirror and feel disgusting. And sometimes I fantasize about being just skin and bone.\n\n\nMy weight loss was not healthy. Anything but. \nI would binge and purge frequently. Not enough to be considered an eating disorder, I thought.\nMy fears of food heightened. I\u2019m scared to even look at soda that isn\u2019t diet. \nMy hair started falling out. \nI would get lightheaded by standing up. \n\nBut the thing is, i thought: I am not, and never was, thin enough to have an eating disorder. I am not a frail skeletal looking girl that could snap in half if you held her too tight. I am not thin enough. I never was thin enough. When I think of girls that are 100 pounds, I think petite. Tiny. Beautiful. But I look in the mirror, knowing I am 100 pounds, and I am not tiny enough. I am not beautiful.\n\n\nHow could I think obsessively checking the nutrition label on everything I put into my body is normal behavior? How could these feelings of hunger encourage me to let myself starve rather than just eat something? Why is that number on the scale so fucking important?

I have nothing *against* them.\n\nBut I often find myself not relating to most recovery youtubers and spokepersons in general. In part it's also because they do what youtubers do, as in overreacting to everything and exaggerating any issue/emotion they feel, but in part it's also because of their genuine personalities. It seems to me that they are either still way too focused on food (see the \"health and fitness\" camp) or too focused on slightly cheesy SeLfLoVe/bOdYpOsItIvItY/nOuRiShYoUrSoUl stuff, like Jen Brett whose life seems to basically revolve around her butt - I mean, great for her that she feels so confident, but I am just not interested, it's not what I am looking for in my own recovery.\n\nThen there are all the hoardes of young white girls, the very stereotypical ED sufferers. Some of them overly bubbly, some others quite clearly still struggling with the illness. Either way, I don't really relate to them. Again, I do have nothing against them, I wish them the best and I know they are helpful for others, but they rarely are for me.\n\nIt seems quite hard to find healthy, resolved, mature adults who have managed to overcome their EDs and offer multi-dimensional insights on the matter. People whose life is really just not about food and body anymore, or who are trying to get there. Tabitha Farrar and Megsy Recovery spring to mind (they have their issues of course but I still like them), and I recently discovered this other girl who I really like precisely because she gives different, more realistic yet paradoxically more optimistic perspectives on the recovery process and what life can be afterwards. If you have the same problem I have I strongly suggest you to watch her.\n\nPlus she promotes the belief that FULL recovery - as in, a life where you don't have \"lingering thoughts\" anymore - is indeed 100% possible, which I truly appreciate and find incredibly inspiring and motivating.

MY POINT IS - i know ive taken some time to get here but please stay with me - is i could not have done it without my therapist.  i just couldn't.  she keeps me accountable, she praises me, she works with me, she listens, she knows what she's doing, i'm sparing you my specific examples but i could go on forever and ever.  like i said, i've been in \"\"recovery\"\" for so long - i tried everything, i really did.  but it's something i could *not* do alone.\n\nmy point is (yes i've had many lol) is that when you are ready to recover, and the day will come, do not ignore the signs. listen to your mind. listen to your body begging for freedom. do not listen to your ed voice. when you do this, reach out. you do not have to do this alone, please reach out for any kind of treatment program you have in your community (i know this is not such a common thing to come by, it's terrible and needs change, but work with what we have right now) because you can't wait. you cannot put your health on hold anymore, let alone your life, your love, your soul, your being.  you are so special and the world is not always going to be this hard.  i know what it's like to feel your eating disorder swallow you whole, if you're feeling like this is going to be your entire life -  it is not.\n\nanyone and everyone is welcome to msg me at any time, you all have been so kind to me throughout my journey of this terrible soul-sucking disease. i love you all from the bottom of my heart, stay strong out there xo", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I was midway through an entire bag of Smarties and enough Chinese food for three people, and made the decision to try it while in tears of self-hate. \n\nSo far I am pleased with it. It has been helpful, I haven't had terrible binges since starting. It helps me be mindful and accountable for my choices and decisions. The lessons focus on the psychology of eating, teaches new methods and aspects incrementally, and reviews you on each day to help solidify the information in your mind. I started a little notebook too, because I retain information when I write it, and just write out the main points and key ideas from the lessons. \n\nI really like that it acknowledges the hardship, the ups and downs, the lapses and the highs, the struggle to get back on the wagon. I do find that the calorie recommendation is too low, but it doesn't punish you or make you feel bad for going over calories, just lists how many calories over. It also groups foods based on caloric density rather than calorie count or fat content, etc, which is refreshing and focuses on fullness rather than strict calorie counting. \n\nThe incremental nature of the lessons and goals is very good for someone like me who tends to set unrealistic goals and then get frustrated when I can't achieve them. The focus on inclusion rather than deprivation is also very helpful. I do feel in a better mental place and my relationship with food is improving. The most impactful thing, for me, is just being more mindful - not eating in a fog of not knowing what I'm putting in my mouth or considering the mental, emotional, physical and physiological consequences that I'll have to deal with as a result. \n\nI would suggest trying it. The first two weeks costs between 0 - 18$ depending on what you think it's worth. And if you balk at the cost after that, as I did, I justify it by saying it's about time I spent money on improving my health instead of all the food I've binged over the years or the material things I've wasted money on. \n\nI will say if you have deeper reasons/trauma etc, discuss the program with your care provider before starting. It certainly doesn't provide that aspect and it's not meant to. But paired with the mental/psychological support you may need, it could be a useful tool.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I had a problematic relationship with food  since I was maybe 12 or 13, I would have erratic binge eating streaks, but I would usually be able to control them if they got out of hand, which is something I am unable to do now.\nThis particular binge eating episode, or better yet binge eating series started last Christmas, and ever since then I was only able to slow it down at times, but then I would bounce back and the binging would get worse. As a result I have gained 25-30lb, and I don't feel good in my body, it feels alien and sluggish. Beyond that, my mood has been deteriorating and I started avoiding social sitations, which just makes the whole situation worse. I have spoken to my therapist and family about this, and even my family doctor but they are all generally dismissive of how much this affects me, as the weight gain didn't significantly alter my appearance, my body is still average to thin. Some of my family members even encourage me to eat more as they see it as a positive change. Before the binge I wasn't really too skinny, or unhealthy looking, I'm just tall so the weight gain isn't that noticable to others, and I come from a family of generally bigger people, both taller and a bit more corpulent,so to them normal involves a lot of food and always getting seconds and all that. Their mindset definitely made things worse, as every time I go back home to my parents or visit my aunt, I tend to overeat.\nAnyway, I find myself thinking about food more than anything else, I constantly want to eat something, be it chocolate, gummy bears, chips, fruit, fast food, pasta, anything really. Even when I recognize while eating that I am no longer hungry, still I end up eating more, and just the mention of dessert means I am definitely eating something sweet.\nI am so exhausted and I really don't know how to stop anymore, to the point of having panic attacks when thinking about this.

I'm away at school, so my family/friends from my home town don't see me too often, except for my boyfriend. Last summer, I was at my lowest weight ever. Things got scary for a bit,my boyfriend essentially forced me to get help or he would bring me to a hospital himself. I had always refused any kind of treatment before. I don't talk about this with anyone.\n\nI've been gaining weight now at a healthy rate, getting the proper nutrients, but still have unhealthy thoughts all the time.

I wish other people could be proud of me. \n\nI wish they knew why I don't like eating out with friends, or in the kitchen in front of my roommates. I wish people knew why I isolate myself. I wish they knew why I always wear form fitting clothing. \n\nThe other day I was standing with some friends and one of them said to another \"wow you lost weight!\" And they did, and they look great, and that should be noted. But I was just upset because no one ever commented when I lost the weight. Most people didn't see it, because it was over the summer. But I was taking a summer course, and no one seemed to notice there. And now that I'm gaining weight, no one's going to come up to me and say \"wow you're gaining weight!\"\n\nIn my one class, we always have snacks. Someone different brings the snack each time. My teacher last year made a habit of commenting on how I could just eat all these snacks and 'gain no weight at all!!!' Little did he know, that chocolate cake or the cookies or whatever was there would be the only thing I ate that day. This year, he still comments on my weight. He told me in a lesson recently that I should really be putting on some weight. I just wanted to scream out to him that I HAVE, that I'm approximately 30lbs heavier than I was in June.

I had been feeling that I was at a standstill in my current counseling and thought I would try out a psychiatrist to see if she might be a helpful supplement.\n\nShe was very brusque and business-like, and about 15 minutes of my \\~35 minute appointment was spent by her adding my information into the computer. I explained my situation and a bit of my history, and she was sort of dismissive of what I have accomplished in the past year and a half. She basically said I need to involve all the people immediately in my treatment, and I explained I had already told my primary care person, counselor, and ob/gyn. And she insisted I need to add a nutritionist and need to change medications, and was dismissive of the help my current treatment providers had been providing. I actually feel okay with what's been going on, I just thought input from a psychiatrist might be helpful.\n\nShe also said that this is something I can never get better from--that it's a chronic condition that I will be \"managing\" for the rest of my life. I asked straight out if she thought this is something people can never get better from; and she was like \"Well, it's something you should keep seeing all the people for and constantly monitor.\" As an added bonus, forced me to weigh in her office, even though I said I have been weighed at my doctors a couple of times this year and I have been avoiding knowing my weight.\n\nSorry this is so long, but I left feeling the most discouraged I've felt in the past 18 months.

I\u2019m 16 and my story is very hard for me to share but I\u2019m really serious about getting into recovery and working for change. I\u2019ve been binging probably since I was 12/13. Often it\u2019s not even foods I really enjoy - simply the act of eating is satisfactory enough for me, but since it is absurd amounts of calories, I am overweight for my height. (5\u20190, 145 pounds) In June of this year, I went probably about 3 weeks of starving myself. (Atypical anorexia symptoms) I would restrict so much, most days only having an apple or one scrambled egg. I would wait entire days for meals - I once cried in the car on the way to a dinner restaurant because I hadn\u2019t eaten in 2 days and was starving. After this behavior for three or so weeks, I had gotten down to maybe 132 pounds and was so proud of myself. Not for long. I went back to my binge eating habits and have been dealing with it since then. I obviously gained the weight back and am somewhere around 145 right now.\n\nToday I met with a personal trainer/nutritionist for the first time who is providing me with workout routines and a food schedule. I think I might be going into something too strict, too fast, but I hate feeling like an alien in my own body. This isn\u2019t me. I want change more than anything. I don\u2019t want this disorder to control me any longer. I\u2019ve been locked up too long.\n\nI hear my parents talk about how they need to check my blood sugar and do all these blood tests because they think I\u2019m unhealthy. Overhearing them talk about that absolutely breaks me because this is my biggest insecurity and I know that I need help. A bit of extra info, no one knows I suffer from this, it\u2019s been a silent battle. They just know my diet consists of mostly junk - they don\u2019t know how much of it. I am worried I\u2019m on the line for diabetes and I don\u2019t want my life to succumb to that, so today I change.

It was supposed to be low cal until the chef decided to give me and my friend an extra set of sushi. Great.\nAfter eating the extra plate, I realized that I had eaten more than my friend. Already I felt guilty. \n\nFast forward and we go hiking at a beach together. All was ok until we got to the pier where there was an ice cream shop. I ordered a snow cone with a cake cone, and my friend ordered a coffee ice cream. At this point in time I was glad about this since mine was lower calorie than my friend\u2019s and it was a chance to level our calorie intakes.\n\nI felt good, until....\nDinner time. \n\nWe went out together again since we ate the ice cream at like 5:30pm. We went to a buffet near the beach and my friend offered to grab some food as she eats quickly. I asked her to get some chili and she did.\n\nLo and behold, she comes back with two bowls; a small and large. \nAs I reached for the smaller bowl, she suddenly retracts her arm and says,\u201d oh that ones mine. I ate too much during lunch and since my ice cream was higher calorie than yours, I figured u needed the extra calories so the other (large bowl) is for you.\u201d\n\nWHAT THE FUCK\n\nI was so triggered at this point and I wanted to cry so badly. Nevertheless I put on my fake face and proceed to dig in the bowl. But guess what? \n\nIt\u2019s drenched in oil (practically no liquid in the chili) and is FILLED with ground beef, 0 veggies or beans I kid you not. \nSince the restaurant charged if you left food behind, I HAD to finish it. I ate that nasty ass shit as fast as I could and burned my mouth along the process. I left the restaurant as fast as I could and slammed the paycheck and went home.\nI literally cried enough to fill Niagara falls on the drive home. Now I feel like ass and I just wanted to vent.

To make things slightly more complicated, she\u2019s recently moved halfway across the world to finish her degree, so we no longer regularly see each other. \n\nOn a good note, she recognizes that she\u2019s relapsing and has made the necessary appointments to meet with a new doctor and psychotherapist. I love her very much and want to support her as much as I can.\n\nSo my question: How can I help my friend from a distance and be supportive without necessarily becoming overbearing or triggering etc.? Are there any good specific materials/books I could read or watch? What are the best ways to ask how she\u2019s doing without seeming intrusive? If she is not doing well, what are some healthy ways I can motivate her to eat and not purge?

Now things are starting to get weird. I started weighing myself 4 or 5 times a day and counting calories. Even though I\u2019m underweight. I decided to stop over the weekend and I ate a bit of junk food.. just a small number of calories over what I had been eating daily in the past week. And I felt super guilty. And I vowed to never do it again and now I\u2019m worried something my be wrong. My school has noticed since I\u2019ve been fainting and tired all the time. From the googling I\u2019ve done... I\u2019m not at the weight for my height where it\u2019s considered anorexic but I\u2019m not sure if that even matters. My school is going to track my down eventually. Should I be worried about being forced into the hospital? I can\u2019t do blood work... needles give me high anxiety and being pushed out of my safe food comfort zone is terrifying.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

Since March I developed a lot of behaviours which comply with \"textbook\" anorexia. Not only in my relationship with food but also my self-image and self-esteem. Right now I realize the mistakes I made and that losing 40 pounds (from March to end of July) was not at all healthy (keep in mind that when I started restricting not only was I at a normal weight for my height but also that I've never been one to \"plump\" much). Right now I'm in a much better place phisically but mentally I still feel in shambles. I've given up some of my restrictions and stopped with the calorie counting. Also, I've started eating more regularly and gained some weight already. The thing is. I just want food. I feel capable of eating and eating and not stopping. I believed it to be normal in recovery but I think I'm already so close to what is a good weight for me that maybe I just can't keep telling myself that. Am I using it just as an excuse to eat what I want? I've never had any troubles with food in the past, quite the contrary. I've been one to always eat whatever I want (be it snacks, cookies, pizza, ... ) and not gain much weight. But right now all I think about is \"oh I can't eat that\", \"oh I've eaten so much today, why do I want more?\". It's also starting to have a really bad effect on my grades and my motivation to deal with all other mathers of life. These last weeks I've even had some suicidal thoughts, which it had been months I didn't have one. Also, I've been going out a lot to dinner which is becoming a bit too pricy but I don't feel comfortable eating at home (just the thought of seating in the couch watching Netflix and eating a cookie makes feel weird). I'm finding it so hard to become myself again and to let myself out like I use to and being able to eat during the day without remorse but the fear of getting fat keeps taking over (not so much as it used to though). My parents have told me that they'd get me a therapist to help me dealing with all of these. I agree with them. There is a lot I'd like to talk and explore. But I keep delaying it because I fear going back to normal, despite understanding how much help I need. Right now I'm also too sensitive and just reading about calories, how many I can eat in a day, \"good foods\" vs \"bad foods\",..., it all makes me tingle and gives me anxiety.\n\nI think I know exactly what I need to do, but I just can't do it.

I really shouldn't have stopped taking them, but I couldn't deal with the weight gain so I stopped cold turkey. I lost it in a healthy way, but I was so obsessed over it mentally drained me. I know it's normal to be upset over weight gain, but it genuinely made me suicidal at times. \n\nNow to a couple of weeks ago, as I've learned self control I have started to heavily restrict, my hair has been falling out more, I feel like shit, but how quick the weight was dropping made me want to restrict more (I still look like crap so not like it matters). And what really made me want to restrict wasn't the weight, it was because I wanted to numb everything. It stopped my anxiety, but of course I was kind of dead inside but it stopped all of these panic attacks and just thoughts of killing myself (I've had five attempts in the past). \n\nI want to stop because I don't want it to get out of control. It makes me feel in control, but I'm just going to get ill by the rate I'm going. But the thought of letting go is making me cry hysterically right now, I feel dumb for being over dramatic but I'm panicking. I'm constantly in pain, I'm not underweight but it's scary how quick my body has changed. I don't know what I'm saying anymore, I'm really tired and I let myself have more calories so now I feel like shit. I want to stop but I'm scared to keep going with this, or I'm scared how awful it'll be without my coping mechanism.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I assume I just came out of the womb overweight or something. I remember being in pre-school and being upset that I couldn\u2019t have the present Santa gave me, because it had lollies in it and my Mum was worried I\u2019d put more weight on, so I had to just sit by while all my friends got their presents and ate their lollies. \n\nI was always jealous that my friends all got to bring crackers and cheese dip, or muesli bars, or juice poppas to school, and I had to have an apple , because \u201cdo you know how much sugar juice has!?\u201d. I didn\u2019t even try full-cream milk until I was a teenager. \n\nI was taught how to read the nutrition labels and see how much sugar a food had before I was 10. \nI always felt huge and uncomfortable in my body, and always jealous of the food my friends had, it was a running joke in my family that HaN\u2019s aLwAys HunGry! Every sport I joined was not about \u201cgo have fun\u201d, but rather \u201cthis is good exercise, you\u2019ll burn calories\u201d.\n\nSo then once I got old enough, around age 14 or 15, I started sneaking food, stealing food, I would walk to the bus stop instead of being driven so that I could stop at the shop and buy food. And it was all the unhealthy food that I\u2019d always been so jealous of, and so then I started to put weight on. \n\nWhich in turned absolutely fuelled my parents dieting at home, which fuelled my sneaking food, and so my weight went up and up. I quit doing the sports that I hated doing. My Mum cried because I was going to die of diabetes, my Dad told me how pretty I could be if I just lost some weight. One time my Dad loaded a backpack with the amount of excess weight that I needed to lose and got me to walk around the house in it, and then take it off just to \u201csee how much better that feels?!\u201d. \n\nNow I\u2019ve finally lost so much weight, my parents are so proud - prouder than when I was winning academic awards or swimming competitions, they talk about it so much, how proud they are of my self-control and my determination, how pretty I am now, how much healthier I am now (lol), and i know it\u2019s unhealthy but I really don\u2019t want to stop.\n\nAnd then yesterday, I was looking for some photos of me and a friend when we were younger. There\u2019s a photo of me at around age 6 and you know what? I\u2019m not fat at all. I go through more photos and I look like a regular normal sized healthy kid all the way up until I started rebelling. I feel so ripped off. A life of stress and fear, and of being convinced I was fat and just always hating myself, and I was just a normal sized kid. \n\nI love my parents, they\u2019re warm and loving and caring, and they had good intentions, but I\u2019m just so mad at them about this.

If I got a piece of fat on my chicken breast or cartilage in my hotdog or even had mashed potatoes, it felt like my throat would close up and I'd loose my appetite. Id stop eating then and there, even if I had only had a few pieces because the feeling was so disgusting. This also made me very underweight. I was 4'10'' and weight 77lbs when I was 12yo. This followed me until I was about 19/20yo when I decided to stop eating meat all together. Ever since then I've expanded what I can and can't eat and today I'm eating more than just burnt hotdogs and pasta but, I'm still not eating enough. It is like I have some sort of block in my head that prevents me from eating food. It might stem from the fact that I find no enjoyment in eating, it doesn't make me feel good, but it doesn't make me feel bad either.

The family member I live with is underweight but she sees herself as fat, so it didn\u2019t help matters growing up. But referring to her! A while back I asked her if she would consider me overweight and she said \u201cprobably.\u201d Ever since then I\u2019ve been obsessing over numbers again which is probably a dumb trigger but that did it alright. I talked to my other family members (cousins, sister, aunt, uncles gf, etc) and they almost seemed stunned? My cousin told me that I wasn\u2019t fat at all and didn\u2019t look overweight, but that the baggy clothes probably mislead her into thinking I am. But then my friends sister (to be fair i hadnt seen her in a year-ish) said I had gotten a little \u201cchubby\u201d an then my friend just said \u201cso?\u201d When i complained about my face being too fat.

I don't wanna say the name but if you're from the US you might be able to piece together where I mean. \n\nHere's the obvious downside. I am SURROUNDED by food at all times. Frozen meals, fresh produce, varieties of sweets, yogurts, drinks, chocolates, literally EVERYTHING. And here's the kicker- most of it is inexpensive. So I know that I could have it if I really wanted it. There's free samples that are always just sitting there, and the store always smells like food. It makes it so hard to restrict. Fast. Anything like that.\n\nThe unexpected upside. I looove looking at people's carts when i'm checking them out at the register. People get this adorable mixes of things, different pastas and veggies and sauces, I always try to figure out what they're cooking. Sometimes when i'm stocking the shelves i'll choose my favorite foods to stock and pretend that i'm eating them (sad, I know) but it sort of works? Just holding the containers and looking at them? Feeling the weight, and texture in my hand. I also know calories so well. I see all the products so often that I can pinpoint the lowest calorie EVERYTHINGS. \n\nI'm the honest disordered shoppers dream employee. If someone came up to me and asked how to make (insert literally any meal/snack/whatever) for under ----- calories, I could show them the ingredients in like five minutes. \n\nAlso, i'm lonely, and cold all the time, so being on my feet and surrounded by people actually helps.

First, I should probably explain a bit about myself I guess:\n\nI\u2019ve never really been happy with my appearance, but it\u2019s never been something that\u2019s bothered me. I\u2019ve been gaining weight for years, as I\u2019ve never had any interest in losing it, but earlier this year I began starting to lose weight slowly as I am overweight and was worried about my health. My family have been worried about it for years, but they\u2019ve always been careful to not try to pressure me into trying to lose weight after my mother gave herself an eating disorder back in the 1980\u2019s.\n\nI started aiming to be a small amount under the recommended calorie intake, nothing serious, and it was working, I was slowly losing weight. And I was fine. But then in September, I started struggling a lot with my mental health, (anxiety, all the symptoms of depression, that sort of thing.) and it only feels like it\u2019s mostly better now, nearly 2 months after it started. But that\u2019s not important.\n\nWhat is important is that during that period of 2 months, I suddenly started to care about what other people thought about me. For the first time, my weight mattered for more than just long term health implications. So I cut all snacks out of my diet. And I was happier, at first. Although my mental health was through the floor, I felt a bit better since I knew that if I lost weight I wouldn\u2019t hate my appearance much.\n\nBut then it started getting worse. I was still slowly losing weight, but it felt like it wasn\u2019t fast enough. I was ugly, it was bad for my health, I should lose it faster. One day, I didn\u2019t each lunch. This wasn\u2019t just because I wanted to lose weight, part of it was that I just couldn\u2019t see any point in bothering to eat.\n\nBut then something surprised me. There was like this voice, except it wasn\u2019t a voice, it was a thought in my mind, but it felt like a voice as I wasn\u2019t choosing to think it. It was telling me that what I was doing was good. And I should do it more. I was a little confused, this was new, I\u2019d never had anything like it before. But the next day, I listened to it and didn\u2019t have any lunch.\n\nAnd it was like the voice got louder, the thought got stronger. \u201cThis is good.\u201d, I thought, and continued doing it. But then after a while, the thought changed, it wasn\u2019t just telling me I should skip lunch, it was telling me I shouldn\u2019t eat breakfast either. I started coming up for excuses as to how I could avoid it, even though my family would notice if I didn\u2019t eat it.\n\nBut then I thought, no, this is how eating disorders start, and ignored it. But the thought was still there, telling me what I should be doing. I started eating smaller meals, but still having breakfast and dinner. One day, I felt really ill during my dinner, so I only ate a little bit of it, despite having no lunch. And then I went to bed, and woke up the next morning. But I woke up late, so I had an excuse not to eat breakfast. So I didn\u2019t. And then I didn\u2019t eat anything until lunchtime, and that was only because my family were with me.\n\nThe scary part is though, it felt like what I was doing was good. I was painfully hungry, my stomach hurt and ached, but it felt good. I felt like I was doing the right thing, and I should keep going. It wasn\u2019t just because I wanted to avoid being unhealthy, I had to keep losing weight. It felt like I had to keep going.\n\nBut I stopped myself. I realised what I was doing was stupid. That\u2019s how my mother ended up in hospital. Since then, it\u2019s been about a week. My mental health has improved a lot, but that thought/voice thing is still there, it\u2019s quieter, but still there. It\u2019s still telling me that I shouldn\u2019t be eating, after each meal it tells me I\u2019m doing a bad thing and that I should stop. I don\u2019t like it.\n\nThe really scary part is that it still sounds like it\u2019s giving me good advice. I am overweight, and I should try to lose it. I want to listen to it. But I\u2019m just worried that this is going to turn into something worse if I leave it, just like it surprised my mum when she went from going swimming once a week to hundreds of pushups each day.\n\nI don\u2019t know what I should do. Is this the start of eating disorder? Am I doing the right thing by ignoring it? I just don\u2019t know. If it wasn\u2019t for my family\u2019s history, I wouldn\u2019t be bothering posting this... but if I am starting to develop something I want to stop it before it becomes any worse.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

My mom (who has been severely fatphobic her whole life, she used to torture one of her sisters for being fat and brags about it) put me on medication that made me gain weight and then made my entire life about losing weight. She was horrified that medication made me fat so she put me on weight watchers and had a trainer for me. At age 7 (all through high school). This caused a completely warped body image, to the point where I was taking tons of diet pills and hurting myself. I've been forced on every diet you can think of and most times they caused health issues, so there was no way my mom was doing it to \"keep me healthy\" like she said.\n\nBecause of this I have the worst relationship with food, diets, and my body, most specifically with food restrictions. Anytime someone brings up dieting, restricting food, counting calories/carbs/etc., I immediately spiral into a place of \"they're saying this because all they can think is that I'm a disgusting, huge fucking whale that has no control over herself. I can't talk about diets without massive panic attacks. I know it's irrational but I can't help it. I ended up being 350lbs in 2013 and have since gotten down to 225 (after moving out, shocker). I'm not skinny but I'm more comfortable with myself and my body. \n\nI've been with my SO for almost six months. About a month ago he started the keto diet and I've been trying to be supportive. He is already very small/skinny and that has caused me to spiral many times. Now that he's talking about losing weight I feel like a giant disgusting pile of fat that should just be incinerated so nobody has to see it. I *know* this isn't normal to think but it's becoming so intrusive that I'm starting to not be able to eat around him. Also it makes me REALLY uncomfortable to think about how my normal meals that I worked so hard to make sure were neither unhealthy nor restrictive are considered \"cheat day\" foods. I know that's because keto works differently from other diets but it's still upsetting. \n\nI feel like I can't bring this up to him because at the same time I'm happy that he found something that works for him. After 3 weeks he's already halfway to his goal weight. I just can't stop thinking that now I need to lose another 80lbs so I'm not this huge sasquatch monster next to him. I need help and I don't know what to do. I want to bring this up but I don't know how and I feel ashamed.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

The need to finish my plate comes from (and with that ever increasing meal sizes)  but also where this lack of permission to eat comes from.\n\nIt seems that a weird key for me has actually giving myself permission to eat when i am hungry. Regardless of what time it is. (Ie if its 4 oclock and i am hungry have a small meal. I can always have tea later. Instead of forcing myself to wait another 2/3 hours and getting into that starvation/binge mode.  I would turn to junk food and snacks because that was MY food and no one could get mad at me for eating it. Plus its the easiest food to hoard because of its long shelf life . So, my partner has made a ppint to buy things like pot noodles, super quick and simple, dont require much effort to put together, i also cant make more than i need (pre portioned) and they are bought FOR ME so i dont feel bad about eating them. Binging is often caused by the bodies natural reaction to starvation. Thats why its so out of control. Be it emotional or physical starvation. \n\nWhat makes you turn to food?\nWhat are yo avoiding? Why are you starving yourself? \n\nListen to your body and give yourself permission to take care of it. Allow yourself to feel whatever it is that youve been avoiding and let it go. No one can do the work for you, but but if you find your trigger you can find a way to soften the blow and eventually stop pulling it altogether.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I talk about my past, recovering but never fully recovering. Current habits. Do not read if you are on the road to recovery!\\]**\n\nLong story short. I had A/N (B/P subtype) for many years. Too many years. You already know the whole story - getting down to a dangerous weight, dragged to inpatient, blablabla. That cycle repeated sooo many times... Until one day, two years ago, it eventually.. stopped. I was getting better.\n\nWhich brings me to today - I honestly don't identify with having an ED anymore. I do not count calories, weigh myself, nor am I even trying to lose weight.  Nobody around me thinks I have any problems anymore. I can force myself to eat \"heavy\" meals on special occasions like holidays etc without too much guilt. I have very few ED habits left. Sounds fine, right?\n\nBut I am not really 100% \"there\" yet. I feel ok, but I don't feel this freedom around food that maybe normal people are supposed to feel? I feel I have a skewed sense of what normalcy in eating looks like, and I can't understand hunger cues very well. Sometimes I think I ignore hunger not for the sake of restricting, but more of because it is what feels normal to me. I mostly stick to foods I am comfortable with, not because I want to lose weight, but because (once again) it is just what feels normal to me and I don't want to freak myself out. I feel like I have developed some almost.. food anxiety that is not classified as ED anymore? Like I just want to eat the amount and type of foods I am comfortable with (not a restriction amount). This has nothing to do with losing/maintaining weight, but rather what just makes me feel comfortable and 'ok' (if that makes sense at all). I don't think about my body image at all when I do this.\n\nOh, I mentioned that I was A/N (b/p). Well, I still do b/p once every few months. I consider it to be \"recovered\" as I used to b/p *every single day (sometimes twice)*, so I don't consider having a \"stress b/p\" once every 3-5 months or so to be particularly debilitating to my life. Yet I know this can't be what full recovery entails... unless it is?\n\nThis has been going on for.... 2 years. Honestly, I feel fine, so I'm not particularly motivated to change my behaviour (compared to when I was in the depths of ED and depressed &amp; miserable). Yet I know it is very weird to behave like this forever... It is almost like some weird in-between stage of A/N and normalcy. Maybe this is just how I'm meant to live? I'm not exactly unhappy but I don't feel fully free.\n\nAn additional note, I am weight restored but barely. I am still slim and my weight has not changed since I first \"recovered\". Doctor said I could stand to gain a little more weight but it's not medically necessary. Maintaining my weight is not my main motivation of my food behaviour at all.\n\n**Sorry for the long read - TL;DR: Many years of struggling w A/N (B/P subtype). Recovered two years ago but still not at 100%. Mostly stick to safe foods and comfortable amounts. I don't identify with ED anymore as am not trying to lose/maintain weight and don't care about body image - it's more of an anxiety thing. I don't feel unhappy. Stuck this way forever?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit - I'm so sorry, am I posting this in the right sub? Should I be posting this in a recovery sub instead?

I want to demand 10 years of my adolescence back. But that's not possible. I want to demand binge eating medication and thyroid hormones. I want to demand millions in compensation. I want to demand extensive plastic surgery to fix my body into its original shape. I want to demand my life back. \n\nI will have miles and miles of stretch marks. I will have loose skin. I will have digestive problems. And I deserve none of it. I don't deserve to have them ruin my body - the body that I'm expected to live in for the rest of my life. \n\nAnd yet, I feel so entitled. I feel like they will laugh in my face and degrade me further. I feel like they will call me irrational and selfish. I feel like they won't understand the pain I have to live with. I am forced to live every day in a body that isn't my own. A body that devours and starves itself, and the real me is left only to try to pick up the pieces left behind from the rampage. \n\nI feel like a spoiled brat demanding something impossible, just because the actions that were possible back in the day *were* never taken by the medical professionals when they were given the option. I'm not me. And I might never be me again.\n\nI'm sorry for ranting. I just really need to feel like someone understands, and you guys do. Sorry.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

Now I'm counting every calorie and I'm having weight-ins every morning and night, writing down the weight every time.  \nThis time it all started at the start of this year with me getting a gym membership to actually get healthy (I sit in front of my computer a lot), then I wanted to restrict on chips and candy to feel even healthier (I have a huge sweet tooth), then I bought a scale and realised that I weighted way more than I thought I did (When I still lived at home I would weigh myself just because and I'd always be 5kgs/11lbs up and down, being just above underweight).\n\nIt just became a downward spiral from there, I started tracking *every* calorie I consumed, I started fasting, I never ate past 7pm, I purged when I binged. \n\nToday I woke up and realised I was officially underweight, and I want to keep going, but at the same time I want to start eating healthy and excersise and *really* have a healthy body, but knowing how many calories there are in everything terrifies me.  \nI'm moving in with my boyfriend in two weeks and my plan is to lose as much weight as I can until then and after that start eating good and excersise. I want to make a good transition, but I'm afraid that it won't work mentally or that he'll find out or that I'll have to tell him.

I have sometimes made attempts to tell them that I eat more than I want to, etc., but I've been too ashamed to communicate my issues clearly. My entire bedroom is full of trash from all my binges, because I wait until my parents are on a trip or something to take out the trash, so they don't find out I'm eating all this crap. I feel like they know about some of it, but they probably don't understand just how much of an issue it is.\n\n  \nI used to lie to my boyfriend all the time, telling him I had to take a bus earlier than I had to, just so I could buy a bunch of binge foods at the store (he lives in a bigger town, I live in a very small town with no store, I take the bus to visit him on the weekends). But a few months into our relationship I told him about everything.  \nI've also told two of my friends.  \n\n\nI know I need to tell my parents. This will not just get better over time. It has caused me so much pain for almost a decade now. I have never saved any of my allowance. I always spent all of it on candy and chips. I owe so many people at school so much money because I lied to them and said I'd forgotten my lunch money and I would pay them back. Just to buy candy and never pay them back. Every time my parents go out for a couple of hours, I bake an entire cake and eat it by myself. I use a mix of all the kinds of flour we have (white, whole grain, spelt, etc.) so they won't notice.  \n\n\nMy parents need to know, but I am so scared. What if they don't understand? I know that it would mean that my dad would have to compromise. He loves me so much, and he thinks he's doing the very best he can. He isn't, but he doesn't know and it would break my heart to have to tell him that the way he treated mealtimes when I was little has left me traumatised. I love him very much, but I know that I'm right. Telling my mum would be easier, but I know she can't keep bad news like this from my dad for longer than a couple of days. Telling my uncle would also be easier, but he lives abroad and he would probably feel like he had to tell my grandma or my mum, considering this is kind of me putting myself in danger.  \n\n\nI also need to tell my therapist. I'm in therapy for ADHD (inattentive type) and depression. I am so scared to tell her. I'm scared people will tell me that I'm making it up, and that it isn't real, as if I hadn't been sneakily eating gummy bears out of my coat pocket for the last 8 years.  \n\n\nTL;DR: please please please give me any advice you have on how to tell the adults in my life that I'm (most likely) struggling with BED", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I meet the diagnostic criteria for binge eating disorder and this is definitely becoming more of a problem in recent years. I weaned myself off Effexor with the hope of the doctor prescribing vyvanse as I\u2019d heard this can help with BED and also be mood enhancing. Ultimately I was prescribed dexamphetamines (not vyvanse) starting at 2.5mg and gradually increasing to 10-20mg.

They\u2019re so good to me, and they\u2019re always there for me when my parents aren\u2019t. So my boyfriend\u2019s dad apparently has this rule for my boyfriend, my boyfriend\u2019s brother, and my boyfriend\u2019s cousins where if you don\u2019t run the Turkey Trot (Thanksgiving-themed race, usually a 5k or 10k) on Thanksgiving morning, then you can\u2019t have pie after dinner. It\u2019s mostly leftover from when they were younger, and my boyfriend\u2019s dad needed to get them all out of the house so my boyfriend\u2019s mom and aunts could cook without multiple small children running around screaming.

I had a wierd sort of moment-- a trigger, I guess? \n\nWe were in art therapy group. The art therapist was explaining the theme for the day, and since I had already heard it I was already working on my piece. In hindsight this was probably very disrespectful to both the therapist and everyone else in the room, but I thought I was being decently quiet and still listened to her talk while I was working. There are two therapists in this group and neither one said anything. \nA client interrupts the woman talking, turns to me, and tells me I'm being very distracting and asks me to stop until the therapist is done speaking. This is fine, she wasn't being overly rude or anything. \nBut I internalized it for some reason and my mind just kept playing this mantra over and over and over-- 'I'm a distraction and a horrible person'-- it was like static noise clouding my rational thinking. I felt really angry-- angry at the client (for no good reason), and angry at myself for being so rude. I decided I didn't deserve to continue and put my tools away as soon as the therapist finished talking. I pulled out a booklet from another group and started to read. \nThe secondary therapist comes up to me and says I need to participate in group by doing *something* artistic; I could make a poem, draw, paint, whatever the fuck I wanted as long as it was artsy somehow. Instead of being a normal human and complying, I simply asked, \"should I go home then?\" and was told that if I don't participate then yes, I need to sign out. \n\nSo I've been on an extended vacation I guess.\n\nWhat upsets me most is that this isn't the first time a correction or constructive criticism has illicited this reaction. For some reason I automatically decide it means I'm awful and need to discipline myself. My parents would threaten to ground me sometimes and I'd go out of my way to make the punishment worse for myself-- either by giving up more provileges than I needed or extending the duration of having some privilege taken away (ex. No phone for a week turns into no phone for 2 weeks)\n\nI don't know what the fuck is wrong with me but I think it's more than an eating disorder. \n\nTLDR: I threw a fit in therapy and am now on day 2.5 of an impromptu 4.5-day weekend.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

And it kind of hit me a little bit ago that now that I'm as far into recovery as I am, those days are now fairly stress-free and actually feel pretty ok. In the past, any deviation from my normal routine eating habits would make me feel so panicked and upset, but now, when I have these random hungry days, I typically just think, \"Oh, I guess I'm a little hungrier today, oh well, I can just eat more.\" and it doesn't really feel scary or dangerous at all. It's so awesome to have these moments of realization of just how far I've come in healing.\n\nAlso, it's kind of cool just observing the way bodies get through certain situations on a primal/biological level like that. The cold sleepy weather often makes me want things like hot toasted english muffins with butter, or a large mug of creamy tomato soup with crusty bread, and after doing some googling about it I learned that our bodies often like eating fats and carbs because they help warm you up and keep your brain alert, and I though that was just so cool that my body just, like, knew what it needed to get through a cold sleepy day like that. It's so weird to me, because for so long during my disorder, my ED made me feel like I couldn't trust my body at all, but now that I actually just let my body do what it wants without interference, it's so interesting seeing how it just knows exactly how to exist and survive so well like that :)", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

My partner and I moved to a different state which lead to some pretty big let downs career wise for me. That, I think, put me in a mildly depressed state. I think I stared eating to feel better. Now, I don\u2019t even feel better when I eat, usually I feel worse. \n\nThis really hit me tonight, when I ate reasonably all day. Then, on my way to work despite not being hungry, pulled through McDonald\u2019s anyway. (I don\u2019t even really like McDonald\u2019s). I acknowledged I wasn\u2019t even really interested but I did it anyway. My partner doesn\u2019t know how often I eat fast food because I\u2019m pretty embarrassed. I often eat it at work (nights) or around lunch time while she is at work. I have to hide receipts and bags from her. In the last two months I\u2019ve probably eaten fast food 5-6 days every week on top of regular meals. I\u2019m about 30 pounds heavier than I was when we moved here despite regular exercise. I\u2019m at risk of high blood pressure and diabetes.\n\nI don\u2019t want to live this way. But even when I have meal prepped I\u2019ve ignored that food in the fridge and opted for fast food anyway. I don\u2019t eat particularly large amounts. For example tonight I got a quarter pounder and a 10 piece nugget with a medium fry. I ate 3/4 of the burger, most of the fries, and about 8 nuggets before I was done and felt disgusting. From posts I\u2019ve read I\u2019m not sure I fall under either a food addiction or a binge eating disorder. My habits do extend to sugary drinks, that pretty much like to have on hand at all times. Soda, energy drinks, coffee, whatever. I don\u2019t have the means to see a therapist right now. I\u2019m curious on people\u2019s thoughts. So do I have an addiction, or do I simply lack self control? Either way I\u2019m just not sure what to do. I\u2019ve tried quitting cold turkey many times and always end up saying \u201cfuck it\u201d. I had two weeks where I agreed to go keto with my partner and I dropped ten pounds. But I hated having to eat that way. I was often angry and mind was always on food. It was after we quit keto that my binging became particularly bad. I gained all the weight back immediately and I\u2019m still climbing. Id really appreciate any advice.", "subreddit": "FoodAddiction"}

Apparently she\u2019s an incredibly interesting person though, and let me smoke weed with her in their basement room. We\u2019re also both pagan and she gave me a ring and told me a lot of crazy shit about herself. \n\nI hadn\u2019t eaten all day because she stressed me out and made me feel really guilty for not cleaning good enough, and I smoked as much as I would when I had a tolerance. As we were talking I started to lose vision and everything went kind of white and blurry, but I tried to pretend I was fine. After a while though I knew my blood sugar was dropping as it has multiple times from smoking lately, and I told her I might black out. She started walking me out the door to go back to my room, but all I remember is waking up on the floor and her asking frantically if I hit my head... \n\nIm honestly still embarrassed because she seemed so worried, and also I\u2019m underage so I\u2019m sure she was scared she\u2019d get in trouble if I died or something. I was super high and out of it and she looked at a slight acne scar on my forehead and says \u201cit looks like you hit your head! idk only you know your own skin discoloration.\u201d I can\u2019t stop thinking my face looks fucked up because she said that, but that\u2019s also just fucking hilarious at the same time. Anyway, I insisted I was completely fine and thought I was, but once I walked to my kitchen I realized my face fucking HURT. My nose still hurts so bad but it\u2019s not crooked so I assume I\u2019m fine. \n\nThis was yesterday, and when I got back from the basement I made myself oatmeal and had to keep lying my head on the counter and almost blacking out before trying to cram this oatmeal to raise my blood sugar, and it was honestly pretty scary. I ended up binging later and I ate a shit ton today too and I feel so guilty about that! I can\u2019t keep riding this roller coaster of restricting and then having some really problematic situation because of it and binging out of fear for my health. \n\nThe amount of times I\u2019ve blacked out in front of people and almost died is slightly terrifying at this point, and I really wish I could just smoke on an empty stomach without blacking out.

I relate heavily, as I also eat like a meal and a half a day plus healthy snacks, and have thought little of it til now. I don't think I'm underweight right now, but I have been before. Like, 2 yrs ago there was reason for concern, but I am currently a healthier weight. \n\nThe problem is that when I was a kid, I was diagnosed as hypoglycemic. I was malnourished due to neglect and poverty. So even though I don't consider myself severely underweight, not eating properly is beginning to get very concerning. I will wake up disoriented, dizzy, sometimes nauseated and with a mild to severe headache. Sometimes this happens at other times as well, but mostly when I wake up. I get dizzy spells during the day, bad shakes, and heart palpitations, which only get significantly worse if I perform physical activities. I carried a large ladder from the front to back yard the other day, and my heart rate was over 120 bpm and I felt like I was about to pass out. This is only 2-3 hours after a meal. Also, fatigued virtually all the time, though sometimes I can feel more mentally awake if I'm focused on something, and tend to forget about my ailments til I'm done. \n\nI have a number of different mental disorders now due to trauma/abuse/etc, but all things considered, I think of myself as relatively strong willed, and when I encounter an issue in my mind or body, I make great efforts to overcome and grow from it, if at all possible. So yes, crippling anxiety is definitely a huge factor in this. But it isn't always pressing me when I can't eat.\n\nAnd now, the fun part that is leading me to post on this sub. Sometimes I can eat well, sometimes I cannot. Sometimes good food will smell and/or taste completely bland, leaving only the aftertaste behind, or I'll get one final bite into my mouth, only to have to wretch it back up into the trash as if it were cough medicine or a nasty tasting shot of liquor. Even if I enjoy it. Sometimes anxiety and depression are factors that can prevent me from eating, but that is not always the case. I am also not worried about my weight, I am happy with my weight range. I don't feel like a model, but I don't feel particularly unattractive either. So it's difficult for me to track down the source to this issue. \n\nMy main concern is that I am not getting the nutrients that I need, despite my efforts to buy more healthy and sustainable foods to try to make up for my inability to eat sometimes. Liquid meals help A LOT, and I've noticed that if it starts tasting nasty, I can choke down a few bites if I go \"MMMMM!\" while doing it, to confuse my brain signals and distract my throat with the vibrations. \n\nI wish I knew what to eat more of to make me feel less awful all the time. I heard hypoglycemia can turn into diabetes pretty quickly, and I can't tell sometimes if I'm having a small heart attack or my sugar is too low or if it's too high. \n\nSometimes eating more carbs helps, sometimes it makes me feel worse. I tried this green smoothie powder today, and was able to ingest about half a serving of it. It wasn't bad, but tasted like ground children's vitamin chewables. I usually like to keep a bottle of Kefir around to aid in protein levels and act as a probiotic. It's the easiest thing for me to drink/eat cuz it tastes like buttermilk and for some reason that works for me. But lately, that's been making me feel very sick. Not the flavor or smell, but how I physically feel afterwards.\n\nAny comments and suggestions are welcome and appreciated, though if you're going to be one of those guys to immediately tell me to seek therapy, I'll still stamp your \"supportive friend\" card for ya, but I ask that you please also add a little personalized something to your comment to make me feel like you at least put some thought into it of your own.\n\nThanks for reading.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

I talk about my past, recovering but never fully recovering. Current habits. Do not read if you are on the road to recovery!\\]\n\nLong story short. I had A/N (B/P subtype) for many years. Too many years. You already know the whole story - getting down to a dangerous weight, dragged to inpatient, blablabla. That cycle repeated sooo many times... Until one day, two years ago, it eventually.. stopped. I was getting better.\n\nWhich brings me to today - I honestly don't identify with having an ED anymore. I do not count calories, weigh myself, nor am I even trying to lose weight. Nobody around me thinks I have any problems anymore. I can force myself to eat \"heavy\" meals on special occasions like holidays etc without too much guilt. I have very few ED habits left. Sounds fine, right?\n\nBut I am not really 100% \"there\" yet. I feel ok, but I don't feel this freedom around food that maybe normal people are supposed to feel? I feel I have a skewed sense of what normalcy in eating looks like, and I can't understand hunger cues very well. Sometimes I think I ignore hunger not for the sake of restricting, but more of because it is what feels normal to me. I mostly stick to foods I am comfortable with, not because I want to lose weight, but because (once again) it is just what feels normal to me and I don't want to freak myself out. I feel like I have developed some almost.. food anxiety that is not classified as ED anymore? Like I just want to eat the amount and type of foods I am comfortable with (not a restriction amount). This has nothing to do with losing/maintaining weight, but rather what just makes me feel comfortable and 'ok' (if that makes sense at all). I don't think about my body image at all when I do this.\n\nOh, I mentioned that I was A/N (b/p). Well, I still do b/p once every few months. I consider it to be \"recovered\" as I used to b/p every single day (sometimes twice), so I don't consider having a \"stress b/p\" once every 3-5 months or so to be particularly debilitating to my life. Yet I know this can't be what full recovery entails... unless it is?\n\nThis has been going on for.... 2 years. Honestly, I feel fine, so I'm not particularly motivated to change my behaviour (compared to when I was in the depths of ED and depressed &amp; miserable). Yet I know it is very weird to behave like this forever... It is almost like some weird in-between stage of A/N and normalcy. Maybe this is just how I'm meant to live? I'm not exactly unhappy but I don't feel fully free.\n\nAn additional note, I am weight restored but barely. I am still slim and my weight has not changed since I first \"recovered\". Doctor said I could stand to gain a little more weight but it's not medically necessary. Maintaining my weight is not my main motivation of my food behaviour at all.\n\nSorry for the long read - TL;DR: Many years of struggling w A/N (B/P subtype). Recovered two years ago but still not at 100%. Mostly stick to safe foods and comfortable amounts. I don't identify with ED anymore as am not trying to lose/maintain weight and don't care about body image - it's more of an anxiety thing. I don't feel unhappy.

Before that was 3 weeks of totally off the rails. It was my first binge since June and it was long and crazy, we're talking 5000+ calorie days.\n\nI'm still not sure how to address the cruise. I talked about it with my dietitian but she's not a therapist or anything. My issue is, do I go in thinking that I will restrict a little or go in with no rules? If I go thinking I will restrict a little will I snap and go off the rails again? Because I think trying to institute 'no eating after dinner' and a no-sugar challenge set me off last month.\n\nI decided to try a couple of rules and not beat myself up if I can't make them. In order of priority:\n\n1. Avoid the late-night buffet. In the past, it's like a super-unhealthy fourth meal and it really doesn't make me feel great after I'm done. I mean, I could eat some pizza and burger and fries and a few cookies, it was really just a late-night binge. In case I do get hungry I'm going to try to horde some fruit and yogurt in my cabin as a healthy alternative. \n\n2. Walk a lot. Exercise is good, plus it tends to make me less hungry and have less cravings. I have one walking tour booked (a foodie tour, but it's like tapas and I don't drink so no drinking and I figure the walking should offset). I'm going to try to get to the gym on sea days to walk on the treadmill, and a few times for lifting hand weights, but if I don't I won't beat myself up.\n\n3. No ice cream machine. It's self-serve and it's just regular ice cream in a sugar cup. I will hit it up a couple times a day because it's there and convenient but there are better desserts available if I want a dessert. \n\nAnd I'll see how it goes, I guess. I'll have Internet, so I might try checking in here, too.\n\nMy worse case fear, though, is getting into bad habits and then hitting up the buffet and going crazy.

I\u2019ve been gaining weight to the point that even my leggings feel a bit too tight for my liking and after today I am just feeling very defeated.\n\nBut I also finally got my big secret off my chest. I told him I am a binge eater and he initially said \u201cI think everyone is\u201d followed by \u201cI see you eat and you don\u2019t eat that much\u201d. This is when I broke down and told him that that\u2019s what BED is. He doesn\u2019t see it because I\u2019m ashamed and I do it while he is at work. I know this isn\u2019t a cure-all, but I do feel a weight has been lifted.

I wanted so bad to stop cooking breakfast and not eat anything for the rest of the day to punish myself, but I realized I was catastrophizing and I wasn't a shitty person for letting something slip my mind. \n\nI cleaned up the spilled water and food, wiped down their cage and calmed them down, then I ate a healthy breakfast. I've been eating like a \"normal\" person for a few weeks now, and it's going pretty well. I'm glad this happened, honestly, or I never would've had the opportunity to think myself out of this unhealthy coping mechanism. You guys can do it to, it's not impossible. You don't have to die like this. I know it's a lot easier to say it than to do it, but starving yourself is a choice you make every day when you wake up. If you're an anorexic like I am/was, you CAN think yourself out of this behavior. It just takes time, patience, and focus. It's not been easy for me at all, I felt like a failure trying to recover, but you aren't a failure and you never were. If anyone told you that you are, they probably hate themselves as much as they say they hate you. Don't take their opinions seriously, because they're not self-aware they're just selfish. That goes for the side of your brain that tells you to stop eating forever, as well. It's a part of you that's selfish and judgemental, the part of you that's best kept in a tiny corner of your brain so you can live and be happy instead.

I hated shopping because I take so long and would often panic and buy stuff I didn't even want. Then something magical happened.

So here's the thing, 99% of the time, the check out people don't suspect anything, Your cart could be full of diet soda, laxatives, sugar free syrup, tea, any of the grim necessities, and the cashier wouldn't notice. The 1% of the time they notice, it's because that person also has an ED. For instance, I notice, but it's not because i'm judging you, it's because I feel some solidarity with you. I've asked my coworkers before if they notice weird carts, and they do not. \n\nAnother thing. People come into the store and spend HOURS there. They eat tons of samples and wander around aimlessly. People without ED's. We don't care, it does not stand out. \n\nLiterally the only thing we remember about a customer at the end of the workday, if anything, is how they treated us.

I normally can\u2019t bring myself to eat more. However, any time I decide to try to eat \u201cnormally\u201d and go over 1,200/ 1,250, it seems like something in my head disconnects and I eat more than I should in a day, around 2,500 to 3,000 cals. Then, I freak out and restrict severely until I\u2019m back where I started with my weight.  I don\u2019t recover-binge often enough to make up for my restricting, and I\u2019m now a few pounds above underweight, which scares me. \n\nHas anyone experienced anything similar, or does anyone have any suggestions? At this point I just want to maintain my weight as it is by eating normally. Thank you to anyone who replies!", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I don\u2019t know if this is the place for it, but I think I\u2019ve relapsed. I\u2019m currently 20F, in college, trying to recover from an eating disorder. I was (am?) anorexic, underweight, malnourished, and pretty severely anemic. I went to see a primary care doctor, dietician, and am now attending counseling at my university. \n\nI\u2019ve never purged (although I think about it a lot, I just don\u2019t like throwing up and haven\u2019t been able to make myself do it even when I try). My bad food habits have been almost entirely restricting and/or fasting. I tried to start recovery about 2 months ago. I thought it was going well, I was trying to eat at least one or two solid meals a day as well as let myself snack. I thought things were really well until I was at my friend\u2019s house about a week ago and he has a scale. I weighed myself and was ready to see an increase, but to my surprise, I was still the same (low) weight.\n\nI was pretty distressed about this and then I started thinking. I\u2019m a vegetarian college student on a budget so most of my meals are home cooked and low calorie (cooked spinach with rice and some fruit, for example). I like eating healthy, but if I\u2019m being honest with myself I usually skip breakfast, sometimes lunch, and try to make up for it with a \u201chealthy\u201d dinner that is usually low calorie. \n\nPhysically I\u2019ve started to have symptoms again (dizzy, cold, tired, head rush when I stand). I don\u2019t want to be a hypochondriac and diagnose myself, but I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m developing [orthorexia](https://www.timberlineknolls.com/eating-disorder/orthorexia/signs-effects/) (link included just in case). Recovery seems pointless if I\u2019m not even gaining weight (although when I look in the mirror I feel like I look fatter than before). \n\nSorry for the long rant, but does anyone who has struggled with/recovered from either anorexia or orthorexia have any advice?

This would usually include pizza, curry, kebab or any other type of greasy food with a very high calorie count. I am not a binge eater particularly but I would feast on these takeaways and only specifically takeaways I had cravings for. I believe it may have been because of my medication. It\u2019s known to effect dopamine pathways and they say a lot of food addiction is to do with that. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m cured as it\u2019s only been a week. But this is the longest I\u2019ve been in bloody ages. And it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve been fighting the cravings. They haven\u2019t particularly been there. \n\nLast Sunday I had a Pizza Hut and ordered a large pizza and a garlic tear and share. Usually I could demolish this. This would be like a maximum order I\u2019d go for but it\u2019s not something I couldn\u2019t handle. I ate only the garlic bread and a couple of slices of the pizza on Sunday night and didn\u2019t fancy anymore until the next day where I ate the rest. It was actually a reasonable portion size I felt for a normal person so I was pretty weirded out by myself. Since then I\u2019ve had a couple of nights where my girlfriend cooked. A few nights of eating by myself. Not particularly healthy meals at home but not that bad either. But I hear it\u2019s best not to go from food addiction straight to dieting anyway so I guess I done the right thing. The meals I cook are often uninspiring and when I do cook a nice meal I think I will really like it but don\u2019t and the leftovers will be chucked. When my girlfriend cooks I love it and i wang more. So I\u2019m very grateful for that. Anyway today I did go out for breakfast with my girlfriend and got an ice cream later but I wouldn\u2019t class those as one of those meals I particularly crave. So I still think I\u2019m doing well. And I think once a week treat is definitely more sensible to 3-4 times a week I was doing. Anyway just thought I\u2019d share my supposed success story. Whether or not I\u2019ve somehow improved in the long term I am yet to see. I think a reduction in my meds may have helped but again I\u2019m not sure", "subreddit": "FoodAddiction"}

A substantial part of why I developed AN initially was a desperate attempt to make my breasts smaller (joke's on me, even at a very low weight, they were a D cup). I ride the restriction-b/p cycle, and my weight is constantly fluctuating pretty dramatically. Because of all the fluctuations, my breasts look like trash. I never liked the way they looked, but now I can't stand to look at myself. There is a lot of loose skin and they sag really far down. Like, they make it look as though my torso is half as long as it is because of the sagging. As I lose weight, they don't even look smaller because there is a lot of skin; they just look like freakish flat bat wings hanging off my chest, and even in a bra, they look big. I am not sure what to do about this. \n\nDuring my last binge cycle, I gained a substantial amount of weight. I have lost it now, and I am still losing weight, but I am never, ever satisfied because of my breasts. They just keep looking worse and worse, and now I won't even qualify for a breast reduction because there isn't a lot of breast tissue anymore, mostly just skin. \n\nI know a breast lift would seriously help my confidence, but I am a full time student, and there is no way I will be able to afford something like that for at least another 5 years. I'm screaming inside, I fantasize about cutting them off with scissors. I am starting to get kind of scared. While I still struggle with eating disordered habits, I have been pretty good for a long time. I don't know what happened, but I kind of relapsed, and now I am at my lowest weight since I was seriously active in my eating disorder. And I still hate my breasts because they're so big. I know at my low weight, they will still be big, and I will still hate them, but they would be smaller than they are now. And I am sort of feeling like, fuck it, I'll just lose enough weight to get these horrible appendages off of my chest. Which is bad, maybe?\n\nHow do you guys deal with this? I have always wanted a flat chest. People who have/had larger breasts and want a flat chest, how do you cope?

Don\u2019t get me wrong me and my parents had a heart to heart talk, and they weren\u2019t a-holes about it, but I just felt bad. \n\nI lied and ended up telling my family that I was okay, which I was, for a while, and that I don\u2019t need therapy and not to just not bother taking me. But after a few weeks it just hit me, and all those thoughts that I thought had gone away came back.\nI\u2019m not bulimic anymore but I restrict, and when I binge I take laxatives. I don\u2019t know what I have I don\u2019t like self diagnosing.

I hope that with the help of the article, they can get rid of overeating and vomiting, greatly reduce their anxiety and depression, and even stop worrying about their body shape and weight loss. I know I have overreached myself, but I just want to do it.\n\n\u3000\u3000I know that many people suffer for this. Therefore, I hope that friends with gluttony will study hard and save themselves first.\n\n\u3000\u3000Let me remind you first:\n\n\u3000\u3000What I am going to tell you may run counter to your intuition, and may also make you afraid of getting worse. But please try it boldly. If you don't succeed, you can still use your original method.\n\n\u3000\u3000If you can't have a heart-to-heart talk and have no teammates to support each other, you should do it alone:\n\n**1. Reflect on yourself and find the root of the problem.**\n\n**2. Be patient, because the process has twists and turns.**\n\n\u3000\u3000Please give the rest to the time and follow the steps of the article. I believe you will get better.\n\n**Lesson One: Isolating External Influence**\n\n\u3000\u3000Media advertising, fashion and beauty industry, etc., make you have unrealistic fantasies about \"slim\" and \"figure\". It is this external pressure that makes you fall into the whirlpool of dieting. We can blame them, but pestering causal analysis is useless. What is really important is to eliminate these adverse effects.\n\n\u3000\u3000Dieting includes many forms:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6qqxbzurddz31.png?width=915&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=febd6d52aa94d2f16ace14896c6c58c61f9b5b51\n\n\u3000\u3000All forms of dieting depend on external conditions or rules to decide \"what to eat, how much to eat and when to eat\", rather than on the body's real needs to decide how to eat.\n\n\u3000\u3000Losing weight through diet can achieve short-term results, but it is doomed to failure in the end. You are in trouble during repeated dieting.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vwcfpnotddz31.png?width=714&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=746fab7aa47f654113e5b329169dc4fbe9861c15\n\n\u3000\u3000Our ultimate goal is to return the eating initiative and decision-making power back to the body.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqk6u1muddz31.png?width=415&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8671ab5e34d0ddb2e519e9783773cec70fe926f3\n\n\u3000\u3000The goal is clear and the approach is very simple, but the process may be long and bumpy. In this process, you may not always be able to move forward, you may turn back from time to time. Because people's emotions and thoughts are always affected by the outside world and become uncontrollable.\n\n\u3000\u3000The best way to eliminate the influence of the outside world is **to shut yourself \"in the room\" and cut off all contact with the outside world without seeing, listening or touching.**\n\n\u3000\u3000No way, right? But you may use this \"**all-or-nothing**\" mentality to look at food, \"**eat or not eat**\", \"**good/bad**\".\n\n\u3000\u3000I'm going to teach you how to walk in the gray zone. The key point is to set the basic rules:\n\n**1) keep things that meet the rules;**\n\n**2) Eliminate the things that violate the rules;**\n\n**3) If you can't make up your mind, keep it for a while and then judge.**\n\n\u3000\u3000//////////\n\n\u3000\u3000The first step is to start with virtual things: including **newspapers and books, fitness App, social media, blogs, TV programs, advertisements, news, websites and all other information sources.**\n\n\u3000\u3000Please look at these sources of information and ask yourself a few questions (the following are for reference only):\n\n\u3000\u30001.\"Has it made my life better?\"\n\n\u3000\u30002.\"Does it cause me anxiety, self-accusation, inferiority complex or other bad emotions?\"\n\n\u3000\u30003.\"would my life be better without it?\"\n\n\u3000\u30004.\"Do I really need it to help me lose weight and keep fit?\"\n\n\u3000\u30005.\"I don't know these things, do they do any harm?\"\n\n\u3000\u3000\u2026\u2026\n\n**\u203bAs long as there is a negative answer to a question, immediately eliminate it!**\n\n\u3000\u3000For example: fitness software\n\n\u3000\u30001.I don't know. I lost a little weight, but I feel very tired every day.\n\n\u3000\u30002. Yes. Compared with the photos shared by others, I feel very bad.\n\n\u3000\u30003.It seems that it will. I've never been so miserable before.\n\n\u3000\u30004. It may not be necessary. It was because everyone else was using it that I tried it.\n\n\u3000\u30005. Yes. I don't know how to practice.\n\n\u3000\u3000The conclusion is: uninstall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u3000\u3000Please write down the answers according to the examples and describe them as clearly as possible.\n\n\u3000\u3000The weight loss information you can access now is basically harmful and useless. My suggested approach is:\n\n* Cancel all fitness/weight loss/fashion websites\n* Farewell to social media\n* Throw away fashion magazines and books\n* Uninstall fitness software\n\n\u3000\u3000It is difficult for you to abandon these things at once, but please try to change first! You should find that without nutritionists, doctors, experts, models and celebrities who judge you \"this is wrong and that is not good\" all day long, life will be much more comfortable.\n\n**Remember: this step, which you may not understand for the time being, is the key step to get rid of gluttony and save yourself.**", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I found it in the highs of my anorexia, when I was absolutely nearing my death. I know for sure that, if I hadn't found a voice of reason here, I would've never yanked myself out of my ED and I'd be dead. Plain and simple.\n\nFor awhile, I headbutted recovery. Went really well. My exams hit and I got severely ill from stress, ended up skipping my lunches to study (stupid thing, don't do that) and was nearing a relapse. I'm constantly yanking myself between relapse and a desperation to not return to who I was.\n\nI have normal bowel movements, I'm no longer a size XXS (small for me!) and I don't have severe chest pains... most of the time. I can sit down without being bony.\n\nHowever, I can't bring myself to eat lunch. I am still in my eating habits, and my exercising has gotten severe. I'm ridden in sunburns from harshly exercising in the Australian sun (even during bushfires, where I could not breathe). I am doing two bouts of speedwalks for 30 minutes a day, without drinking water in fear of bloat. My body dysmorphia is chronic. I do not know what is a varicose vein, a stretch mark, broken capillaries, it's all stretch to me.\n\nBut, I don't count calories anymore. I'm still terrified of pasta, and now (unfortunately), my rock cakes. But I don't count. I don't stand and check my stomach, but I still do inspect sections of my body and hallucinate stretch marks. Or, see cuts and veins as them.\n\nMy family thinks I'm healthy and recovered now. We have moved onto the next 'problem' of the family, another member suffering from some mental health issues as well (thankfully, not ED). It appears my family can only focus on one person at a time, and when it was established that I wasn't going to starve to death, the baton is in my hands.\n\nOnly I can get myself out of this mess again. I recently turned down my mothers options to buy me low calorie hummus, Yakult and so forth so I could get those additional calories. Scary, but I am proud.\n\nI have also taken my own advice I gave to a few members here a few months ago when I was better. Drinking is easier than eating. Milk is high in calories, smoothies and all that. I drink milk consistently throughout the day, especially So Good Vanilla Almond! It's the best.\n\nAnyways. Just thought I'd drop in here and say hello again. I had to take a small break to try and yank myself out of this relapse, but I have met some wonderful people here and am relieved to see they're okay. I just wanted people to know that I'm alive. Struggling, worse off than before, but alive and intending to do better.\n\nThank you. &lt;3 P.S. Any tips to ignore stretch marks that eat away at your mind?", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I've now completed day 4 and I can't contain my excitement!! I just came home from eating bingsoo with my boyfriend and usually we share our food but there was a mix up and we ended up having our own large bingsoo.. Not gonna lie, I had a bit of anxiety because I was afraid of binging when I got home... Having an entire portion to myself + eating late does trigger my BED. Sharing my food with others has helped me the past 4 days since I've been going out 4 days in a row. \n\nEating late triggers me because there's less people out during that time so not a lot of people can see I'm binging. Not even sure if that makes sense??? \n\nUsually when I have an entire portion to myself, I'll finish the entire thing, go home and binge on whatever is in sight, go out again and pick up church's chicken and apple pie cause I fucked up and I might as well keep digging a bigger hole cause I fucked up! \n\nFast forwarding to today, went out to eat bingsoo with my boyfriend. Probably has about 6-7 spoonful of bingsoo left but I didn't feel like finishing it off. Came home and watched YouTube and realized \"shit wow, I didn't binge wtf???\" Having a whole portion to myself + eating late would usually trigger me and I would think about food non stop until I went out and got more. BUT NOT TODAY. \n\n**Loves\\_nappacabbage 1 / BED 0**", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

He always tries to be as supportive as he can be, and I appreciate that, but I cannot help but feel bad for him having to deal with me and my issues, is that normal?\nI've been with him for about a year, so my ED is still a recently new thing for him to get his head around which makes sense. But I'm so conscious of scaring him away with the honest reality of what I'm dealing with. He's spoken about previous relationships and having to deal with mental health issues and has always expressed an understanding and patience attitude in the respect that it's out of my control. I'm just worried because I know your SO's mental health is impacted by your own and I cant bring myself to express the reality of how down it makes me feel because I'm never usually an unhappy person. \nI don't want him to feel as though I need constant support or for him to deal and provide a solution for me because it just doesn't work like that. But sometimes, you need someone there but I don't know how to relay that to him without giving off the wrong impression.\nAnother thing that bugs me is, he also spoke about his ex suffering from severe depression and although understanding and caring towards the situation always mentioned how exhausting and frustrating it can be to help someone with their mental health, which again I get because in no way shape or form is it a simple concept. I'm reluctant to tell him the full reality as I don't want to cause issues for him or led him to have to worry about me constantly. I'm super stuck on what to do!", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

Since I\u2019ve told her I thought I had an ED she\u2019s just told me that that\u2019s basically impossible because she sees me eat and I\u2019m not \u201cthat skinny\u201d (my BMI is literally 15.4).

It was a pretty big sandwich with salami, bologna, ham, provolone cheese, lettuce and Italian dressing. I ate the whole thing and while I was proud of myself for eating I was also feeling guilty for eating so much. I sent my mom a picture of the sandwich expecting her to be proud of me for actually eating but she called me and kind of sounded mad. She asked if I ate it all and I said I did and she started telling me I was lying and not to lie to her.

I have never been able to do it. Every time I started a diet, I always knew it was very hard to begin with, and I probably wasn't gonna succeed. And so I never did succeed.\n\nAnd then I gave up this week. I tried to go for an \"easy diet\", or at least something I thought that anyone in the world could do. I tried doing a 16:8 IF. And guess what???? For the first time in YEARS, I have been able to fast for 16 hours. To most people it's nothing but to me it's a HUGE DEAL! The whole time I was thinking \"this should be easy for you, anyone can do this, why are you having cravings it's just 16 fucking hours.\" And because I *thought* it was easy, and kicked myself for feeling temptation during something as simple as that, I succeeded.\n\nIdk, I'm just super happy and wanted to share.

{"post_id": "dy8rzp", "created_utc": 1574108311, "title": "Getting out of compulsive physical activity patterns?", "author": "Syrpaw", "self_text": "Sorry for the long story. See the TLDR at the end.\n\nI have restrictive + binge purge eating disorder for many years. Last years it transformed more to a \"physical activity disorder\".\n\nThe fact is, I do not \"officially\" exercise. I don't go to the gym or put on running shoes. Instead, physical activity is spread throughout the entire day. Mainly walking the stairs carrying weights, some running back and forth in the garden, and cycling with lots of weight on my bicycle. It is almost all coupled to daily activities like taking the trash out, taking a shower, shopping for groceries, vacuum cleaning, etc. They all involve these rituals that require much more physical activity then necessary.\n\nMost parts are in a relatively low pace, so I don't often get physically exhausted. When I do I have to wait until I can continue. More often I get mentally exhausted. Most of me hates doing it, so I often can't get myself to continue. Or even start... Then I have to wait until I get so frustrated of waiting that I continue.\n\nOn bad days, I can be \"busy\" for 8 hours or so (including the waiting). On days in which I manage to skip (sometimes a lot of the activities), it mentally still consumes a big part of my day (feeling guilty, being scared it suddenly comes back, and worry if tomorrow will be a highly active day again). \n\nAt night, I binge-purge. Always the same times, foods and amounts. \nOver the years I learned ways to reduce the impact it has on my digestive system. I know it's probably still pretty bad for my body in the long term. It's like a relief from all the frustration during the day. I tried to stop in the past but then I started to get strong binge-purge feelings during the day. That was much worse because those binges were much more \"out of control\" and involved lots of high-sugar foods which made my blood glucose fluctuate like mad. This combined with the physical activity did not feel too healthy... So I for now I accepted the night binge-purging.\n\nDuring the day, I usually eat way too little for the amount of physical activity I do.\nI read so much recovery stories and articles about eating disorders that I know what I can globally expect when I increase my energy intake (fat distribution, water retention, extreme hunger, etc.). But I think the stress of the malnutrition is a big reason why I can keep doing this amount of physical activity. I fear that every part of this whole activity regime collapses when I start eating more for recovery. Already experienced this on days I tried to eat more. And I'm afraid of a huge sudden weight gain when I do both; burn much less and eat more.\n\nThe stupid thing is when I look in the mirror I think I'm way too skinny. Makes sense since have a pretty low BMI. I want to be fatter, specially on my arms and legs. On the other end I can't help feeling relieved when the scale shows a lower number then the day before. Not that it changes much; my weight has been pretty stable for years.\n\nMy idea is that a big contribution to recovery would be getting out of these activity rituals. Maybe then I would not need a stress relief at night and have less fear to eat during the day. I'm just kind of lost in the difference between normal activity and \"exercise\" since the two seem to be interwoven in my case.\n\nFor those of you who stopped compulsive exercise; what did this look like in practice? How much physical activity was/is left? \n\nDo you occasionally engage in activities that involve some physical activity?\nPlaying with pets/children, activities at your job, cycling/walking (to school, work or shops), vigorous cleaning, or anything else? Or do you still do some exercise?\n\nAnd with how much effort (raise heartbeat? Sweat?)\n\nI have already seen many therapists. Some were nice to talk to, some made my anxiety and obsession worse. No therapy resulted in recovery.\n\nTLDR: For those of you who stopped compulsive exercise; what did this look like in practice? How much physical activity was/is left?", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I've always had a sweet tooth since i was little, i was living with my grandparents 98% of my life so they treated me well with food and sweets. Ive never been into shape, my whole life i body shamed myself because i never looked my best. When i was around 16-17 years old i kinda stop eating that much i was skinny.. but not fit. i truly didn't feel hungry. At that time my ex-boyfriend literally after 3 weeks of dating, got a pretty bad rare disorder \"Galenbare\" i thinks it called this but not sure.. i stopped eating i was under so much stress, cuz you know one day you see a person perfectly healty and the next they they cant walk, talk and do anything by themselves. He broke up with me because he didn't want me to feel bad for him and yeah( he is better and healthier now tho).\nSo yeah , a year later i found my current boyfriend and then everything started to go downhill with my eating. Im not sure exactly when it strarted (my binge period) but i remember smoking quite a lot of weed and i was everything an enormous amount of food when i was high. Everything tasted so good and in a year i reached my highest weight 64kg. Which is not a lot but i was chubby and i felt gross. At the beginning of 2019 in April i decided to start working on my body weight . For 4 months i was doing Intermittent Fasting and it worked i lost around 5kg without changing my diet. then when i saw the results but i stopped losing weight any more, i moved to something more extreme Keto Diet. I knew it will be a change, because of my obsession with carbohydrates ..but i wanted to challenge myself just to see what will happen. I was doing great the first 2 weeks, i was eating a lot less, because fats made me full for 4 hours and in just 2 weeks i lost 4kg. i was so proud of myself. Until my life became a mess, me and my boyfriend got thrown out in the middle of the night from our landlord, accusing us for not paying 1 month rent a 1 and half ago .. we slept 2 week in a strangers house(a friend of our friend) me and my boyfriend lost our jobs, we just started a new more stressful one, we moved into a new place, we didn't have furniture, we were starting 2nd year university.. and we didn't got paid by our last employer.. so yes it was kinda an amazing experience. The 2 weeks spend into the strangers houce, i didn't cook i felt uncomfortable to do it.. so my Keto diet was over.. and you could imagine what happened.. i gained everything back ... 7kg in to months.. \nThe worst part is i documented my weight loss journey on social media (Instagram) people loved my results they were proud... after what happened i stopped using my instagram i was and still am ashamed of myself..  I don't look in the mirror i don't take pictures i don't even look at my body while im taking a shower... I only feel shame, i don't feel good about my body, i dont like my legs, bottom and belly... \nIm trying so hard to stop my binge eating but it is so difficult, i start my day feeling ready to change my diet i eat a nice good salad or smoothie and after that i just buy myself 10 donuts and eat them just to feel full .. The speed im eating them is crazy literally after 15 minutes they are gone and am hungry again.. i feel like i want to make myself sick.. Sometimes after my binge period i just want to throw up everything just to take the guilt out of my shoulders. And im starting to think more and more about throwing up because i don't think i can ever stop overeating... i would never feel satisfied after meal ..\nWhat do you suggest?\nAny tips, any idea what to do ? \nShould i buy appetite suppressant?\nShould i see a doctor about that?\nCan you tell me your story?

After my workout, my trainer told me I needed to have some carbs and that pasta was okay. I had maybe less than 1/2 a cup of the pasta, and it\u2019s my favorite kind. I would have binged and ate the entire thing normally but I limited myself to a fairly normal portion, seeing as I was coming from a workout.\n\n2) Cookies. Okay, it\u2019s just one cookie that was in my containment. But normally I would have gobbled it up in one bit, but I took my time and savored it, only to get half way through it and made a conscious decision that I wanted to save the rest for later, and stop eating. THIS is my biggest accomplishment of the day - not finishing this because I knew I was full and didn\u2019t REALLY want the rest of it. I definitely beat the binge monster with this one.\n\n3) Popcorn. When I got home, I saw two GIANT bags of my favorite type of popcorn on the kitchen table (my mom got them from the grocery store). This was my ultimate binge snack two weeks ago. I ate so, so much of it. They\u2019re huge bags and I emptied half in 25 minutes easily.

{"post_id": "dydvw7", "created_utc": 1574129960, "title": "Unsupportive Parents during BED", "author": "nekokaeru", "self_text": "Hello, I would like to reach out to this community to see if anyone out there faces the same problem as I do.\n\nFor context, I am 21F. As the title suggests, my parents have never been supportive throughout my binge eating disorder. I only discovered myself to have BED back in 2017, and that year was when I went through my biggest life crisis to date \u2014 failing to get into university. I was horribly depressed and resorted to food as a comfort. I was initially confused as to what was happening to me, but after plenty of hidden wrappers and most importantly immense guilt, I found out I related to all the symptoms of BED.\n\nAs I aimed to become better through meditation, I no longer binged and my depression became more controllable. I felt as if I was \"fully cured\" (note: I wasn't) after successfully getting into uni in 2018, albeit one year later than the rest of my peers. What I didn't notice was I actually experienced relapses (in both depression &amp; BED) even after getting into uni, where I was supposedly in a happier state.\n\nFast forward to today. This year has been a wild ride. I am currently experiencing one of my worst relapses to date. In 2017, I was depressed and as a result developed BED. Today, I am depressed because my BED is out of control. Yet again I am getting consumed by food, and as much as I wanted to stop myself, I ended up binging more instead.\n\nSo here's the main point. After gaining a shameful and noticeable amount of weight from binging over these 2-3 months, I decided that enough was enough. I've always kept my personal struggles to myself, but I really felt like I was about to explode. I decided to be raw and vulnerable with my parents and told them about my binge eating disorder. My mom has BED as well, which arose because of her dysfunctional and abusive childhood, but her experiences are of course way different from mine.\n\nAt first I thought my mom would be able to relate to me and would be gentle with me. But I was wrong. She told me to stop thinking I \"had a disorder\", and I just needed to incorporate self-control and self-discipline into my life. My dad also told me to just \"have better control\". These things aren't wrong per say, but I felt so misunderstood. They didn't properly listen to what I had to say, and even after I told them what BED was according to the DSM, and that I related to all the symptoms, they still thought of it as simply gluttony and a lack of self-control around food. And that made me so pissed, because they even said stuff like \"but you aren't puking (bulimic) or starving (anorexic), that's not a disorder\". I believe they aren't educated on such issues, and my mom even told me to stop \"believing whatever I was reading online\". I almost lost it at this. I couldn't fathom why she couldn't ***empathise*** with me even though she had the same exact problem.\n\nWhich I would like to add on as well. I guess I developed BED due to trauma from hitting an extremely low point in my life (back in 2017). But the reason why I would even resort to food for comfort is most probably due to my mom's mindset on food.\n\nI wouldn't say my parents aren't supportive at all, because they are seeking to help me, but they just fail to understand what I'm truly going through and have the wrong focus. They simply dismissed my BED and now I realised that they are trying to make me ***lose weight*** instead of rebuilding my relationship with food. Because I still live at home with my family, my mom prepares almost all my meals unless I am not at home. She's trying to restrict the amount of calories I'm consuming per day, which is not wrong by the way. But I know very clearly the detrimental effects of the binge-restrict cycle on my body, since I've fallen prey to that countless times. But if I request to eat normally (average 2-3 healthy meals per day) to avoid binge urges from coming up, she is convinced I would \"stay fat forever\". Of course I do eventually want to lose weight, who doesn't!! But it's just been a vicious cycle trying to restrict calories to lose weight but I would almost certainly end up binging due to the restrictions, and gain even more back.\n\nYesterday, I talked to them again regarding my BED and opened up to them how difficult it is to reconstruct my relationship with food. Yet again, they told me that ***losing weight*** would require a lot of willpower and hard work, and that it's not an easy journey but they would go through it with me. Yes, I am grateful that they are supportive in a way but they simply fail to understand my point, which is extremely frustrating! I then mentioned to them that I wanted to see a therapist instead, since they failed to understand that what I'm going through isn't just a \"weight gain\" but a distorted relationship with food and myself. My mom blew up and got really angry and simply told me to adhere to her diet plans.\n\nSo now I'm typing this, hungry, or rather ravenous, because I only got to eat a piece of wholemeal bread, salmon, a hard-boiled egg and some broccoli for the whole day. I don't think I even hit 1000 calories, and to be honest I can already see where this is going. As long as my parents aren't home, or if I go outside (after my final exams are over) with my friends, I can already foresee a binge, and another restriction, followed by another binge, and the vicious cycle will go on and on.\n\n**How do I tell my parents that what they are offering isn't support but instead, they are destroying me even more?** I've seriously thought of becoming bulimic by purging, or seriously starving myself so that they will \"recognise\" that it's an eating disorder, a true mental illness that requires help, that I'm facing. It is no different than the time back in 2017 when I opened up about my depression and they dismissed me. I'm already putting myself out there, albeit how raw and vulnerable I feel, and asking for help, but my parents can't seem to acknowledge that fact. And I really don't know what to do about this situation, because I feel so stuck.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

(of course when i\u2019m sober food is on my mind 24/7)\n\nthe nuggets were SO greasy, moist, and rich. i felt the salt and grease irritating the back of my throat. i couldn\u2019t finish the 4 nuggets that i\u2019d gotten. the fries were the same, extremely salty and fatty tasting \u2013 i ate all of them but with great difficulty. the apples they\u2019d given me, i could taste that they weren\u2019t extremely fresh and their lack of crunch and lack of \u201cpure\u201d taste of sweet fresh fruit was disappointing. in my head i wanted to eat all of these things because i was hungry and bc of the weed but the physical sensations were just insanely intense. \n\nwe also were eating halloween candy. i had like one mini square of a milky way, and it took me so long to eat completely. i put the whole thing in my mouth, but the caramel went into my teeth and stuff ya know like sticky foods tend to do. it took me several minutes to poke around my mouth with my tongue and leisurely swallow all of the stuff that was left behind after my initial swallow. \n\nit was So Sweet! i remember thinking, \u201coh my god, my mouth has so much space in it, there\u2019s so much room for food to get stuck in, how could i ever scarf these things down when i\u2019m sober? how do i not appreciate all the flavors and how much room my mouth has in it?\u201d\n\nalso, shrooms just make you feel pretty and not care so much about your body. i usually have anxiety about eating in front of people but i had none at all.  i felt naturally beautiful and skinny and laidback as i ate. no worries at all about how i looked, what my face looked like as i chewed, was i eating too fast etc. it was great. \n\ni SO wish i could eat so slowly and really feel all the food\u2019s flavors and textures like i did during this trip. sober, i can scarf down close to 10 candies in the time that it took me to eat just one. i would finish the happy meal within 10 minutes and not be phased at all by the grease, salt and fat. if i could eat like this when sober then i would be SO skinny.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Like I know this is laughable and feel free to openly laugh at it in the comments. I probably need to hear it. \n\nSo basically I started restricting a little over a month ago now. I've always had disordered eating and I used to purge when I was like 12. \n\nI'm severely overweight. And no, it's not my ED saying that. I'm 5'3\" and 197 lbs. When I started, I was 216. Fucking disgusting, I know. I probably don't even belong here with stats like that. Back when I was younger and I was purging and restricting I got down just above underweight. One day, I just decided I'd eat 1,200. For a week I ate 1,200. Then I had a day I ate 800. I felt that same sense of euphoria and I was so pleased with myself. Since then I've been eating under 1000 pretty much every day, usually around 700 ish, But I do have days where I go a few hundred less or a few hundred more. Someone of my weight should eat like 2100 to maintain, and my TDEE is like 1700. So 600-900 is high restriction, but I'm taking weight off pretty quickly and I'm pretty happy about it. I feel like it's going down a bit slower now, maybe i've hit that \"plateau\" everyone talks about. I track every thing I eat in the Lose It app and I weigh out everything on a food scale. I always go a gram or two over to make sure I account for every single calorie I eat. Last week was good, I averaged 700, but I had one day that I ate 1189 and I felt really bad about it. But tonight, even though I'd planned to stay under 800, I binged and got to 1256. And I feel so fucking bloated and gross and fat and disgusting and I don't know what to do with myself now. I'm already not losing as fast as I want. I already feel like a fucking poor excuse for an ED, I wish I was strong enough to keep it under 600. I can't stop thinking about all the calories I ate today. I know I probably won't gain from it but that's all I can think about is how it's gonna hinder my progress. I don't know what to do.

I have a tattoo that has the NEDA symbol on it and I\u2019ve explained it once but essentially just said \u201cNEDA heart\u201d and he didn\u2019t question it so I didn\u2019t say the acronym and it\u2019s been over a year since then. \n\nBut I feel like a dirty liar not saying anything. I just don\u2019t know how to bring it up and I don\u2019t know how to explain it. I\u2019ll say this ED was \u201cactive\u201d (I was participating in disordered eating behaviors) for about 10 years of my life. I\u2019ve been passive or in recovery for about 2 years where I have thoughts but I\u2019m not acting on them. So as you see and you know having an ED has been a huge part of my life and influenced a lot of the decisions I made which got me where I am today.\n\nI guess part of the reason I\u2019m antsy about telling him right now is 2 things:\n\n1. Last week he mentioned a celebrity pic one of his friends shared on FB and friend said something along the lines of thick girls are hot ( I cringed writing this). My boyfriend said he thought this celebrity wasn\u2019t particularly attractive to him and also said she was too skinny anyway. So I went \u201cyou don\u2019t like thinner girls.\u201d And said \u201cnot like that.\u201d So I\u2019m not sure if he just told me I\u2019m fat or if he thinks I\u2019m unattractive. I didn\u2019t say anything after and the subject changed. But I can\u2019t stop thinking about it.\n\n2. Thanksgiving. \n\nI\u2019m sure this holiday is probably complicated for most of the users here. My family doesn\u2019t really acknowledge that I\u2019ve had an ED, but that\u2019s something to unpack another time. I want to have dinner with my family because I feel more comfortable eating in front of them, and additionally one of the elderly members of my family is having a heart issue. His parents have never met me either so there\u2019s also that. He\u2019s invited me to his thanksgiving, but I don\u2019t want to go because of the above reasons. Plus I know if I go I\u2019ll be so nervous I won\u2019t eat anything and feel so rude for not eating anything but really, really, really badly don\u2019t want to eat in front of them.\n\nI know he really wants me to meet his parents because he\u2019s very close to them so I feel like such a disappointment for turning down his mom\u2019s invitation when the truth behind is \u201csorry I can\u2019t go, I\u2019m too terrified to eat in front of your family\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve only really been able to explain my ED to my old counselor since her literal job is to listen to my feelings to council me and in writing or drawing.\n\nAnother few things about how I don\u2019t know how to approach is I\u2019ve talked about having anxiety and going to counseling and he\u2019s answered \u201cit seems like a lot of girls I know have anxiety.\u201d And also about how he was starving on our first date and I was hungry too but he knew I would barely eat because \u201cgirls never eat in front of guy.\u201d Even those two things have made me shutdown telling him about having an ED because they\u2019re a lot deeper than what he thinks. \n\nI just feel bad not saying anything and getting upset because how could he even know? I don\u2019t know how to open up about it and be honest without having him look at me differently and worry about me and having him know the horrible mess of things I\u2019ve done to myself.

I think if I were to lose it I could function a bit better at work (I take food to people's seats at a small movie theater) but as it stands right now, I run one order out and by the time I'm back in the kitchen I'm tired and I need to sit.

I was diagnosed with Anorexia when I was 19 and got some help, but recovery took several years (I mean as in getting my period back and normal BMI). The mentality and obsession with calories and exercise never left me. I only agreed to recovery initially if I was allowed to go to the gym and tone up.

Recently he found out that they have to move out of their current house by the start of the new year. He hasn't talked about it much but I can tell he's upset that his dad didn't talk to him sooner about it. My boyfriend is very tall and is skinny but not alarmingly skinny. In the beginning if our relationship he would mention things like oh I havnt eaten at all today or I don't think I ate yesterday. Today he opened up a little bit more. He explained that he has been feeding and buying food for himself since he was a junior in highschool (he's now 20). He's really tight with money so I think he just sees buying food as a waste of money. He really wants to save and get away from his dad. He said he was 140 when he graduated high school and is now 128. He's 6'1ft tall btw. He is also a smoker now. So I guess my question is: would this be considered an eating disorder? He probably does have some mental issues. But I don't think he's not eating because of emotional stress, I think he just doesn't eat because he sees saving money as more important than his health.

I have a problem with binge eating, and I need help. I've been on various diets and counted calories in the past, but I think that's making the frequency and severity of binges worse (helped initially, but the behaviors came back with a vengeance and now I can't seem to stop). I want to seek professional help to develop a better relationship with food, especially because I have an increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and hypothyroidism due to polycystic ovary syndrome and family history. Unfortunately there are some complicating factors - my husband (who has good intentions, so please don't attack him) hounds me about counting calories constantly and he doesn't even know about my binging. His constant nagging about my eating habits has caused me a lot of stress, resentment, and guilt. I also know that the binging is likely based on childhood issues. \n\nI'm not sure who to ask for help - a counselor, or a dietitian. Unfortunately my insurance doesn't cover any eating disorder specialists that work with diet AND therapy, and an intensive outpatient or inpatient treatment facility isn't possible due to my work schedule and home responsibilities. I am also worried about telling my husband about wanting to seek help, because I think he sees it as a personal failing (and sees my struggle with weight as a lack of discipline), and will just tell me I need to count calories because \"it worked before\". I want to fix these bahaviors before I develop a serious health issue such as diabetes or my mobility is affected. Weight loss isn't my primary goal, I am actually happy with my body - just concerned about my health in the future.

I was smaller than everyone on the football team, and I was always the skinny emo kid. I was always underweight, but I ate enough food. I wasn't self-conscious of it until my guardian would force me to drink protein shakes and eat protein bars before leaving the house. She'd make me sit at the table and eat fries and milkshakes before I could go to bed. She was always making comments about how gross it was.\n\nI live in southern US, so of course a lot of people here are very big. I know it's linked to poverty, but it's insane how EVERYONE here is usually very large. I would constantly get \"chicken legs\" or \"you need to eat a cheeseburger\" comments. I felt emasculated and have been called a \"faggot\" my whole life for looking the way I do. I graduated high school at like 110 lbs, 6'1\". I ate junk food all the time. I ate all the time.\n\nI didn't gain weight until I hit 23. I finally hit 160. I saw candid photos of myself and saw that my legs were thicker, shoulders (biggest insecurity) were wider, etc. I fell in love with my body. I was growing a beard and finally felt like a man, and not a twink anymore. Three months or so pass and I'm at 190. I'm trying on clothes at TJ Maxx and my gut is hanging over and I can barely breathe as I'm bending over. Now I was fat as fuck. A couple months later I shaved my beard to see what I'd look like, because it had been a while. I saw how big my double chin was. I used to have a chiseled jaw and was told I was \"model material\", but I had become what looked like what women call a neckbeard, without the beard. I grew my beard back out and ignored it. A year later I started to really lift weights so I could obtain the \"strongman\" look and embrace my stature. I did this for several months, and started seeing a girl I had a crush on for years. I was driving to Ohio to see her every weekend. The first time I visited her, I was so focused on her that I honestly forgot to eat for three days. I didn't even think about being hungry. After I noticed this, I realized it was pretty easy to just not eat. I dropped 15 lbs pretty fast. I was going to the gym a lot still, and my girlfriend and I were having very frequent sex. I was no longer out of breath while doing so, and I honestly think it helped me lose weight, being cardio and all. I stopped eating so much, and I watched myself drop 50 lbs over the course of a month or so.\n\nA few months went by and she started acting weird. I could not eat. I didn't even feel the need to eat. She eventually dumped me, and I went like a week or a week and a half without eating. I dropped my weight fast, and got down to 155. I started taking photos of myself and I looked amazing. Most of my gut was gone, legs looked pretty again, etc. I was no longer a \"fat fuck\". But I shaved my beard and my neck was kinda still there. I started doing the \"neck exercise\" again where you motion like you're kissing the ceiling, but I still feel gross. I'm up to 160 again. I'm constantly going to the gym and weighing myself. I'm not lifting weights as I don't have the energy or drive to do it anymore. I'm constantly covering my neck. My gut still feels gross when I sit down. I know, I know. \"Everybody's looks like that when they sit down!\" Well I used to not feel disgusting.  \n\n\nI'm also lactose intolerant and addicted to drinking milk so I shit my brains out. I gave myself hemorrhoids this way a month ago but they're gone. However, I've noticed that it helps.\n\nI love food way too much. It's not the pangs that bother me, it's not tasting food. I've considered tasting it and spitting it back out but haven't gone that far, yet. It's very difficult for me to throw up, so I just don't eat. I'm going insane over here. It's all I think about. I see pictures of me three years ago and my jaw looked so nice. I'm 26 now, but I wish I looked the way I did then.", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

I consider myself rather rational, in all other areas of my life. Except when it comes to my eating? Forget it. While I rationally know that there is nothing wrong with rice (for example), I avoid it like the plague, as it feels so heavy in my stomach, and tends to make me bloat up/constipated, so that's \"bad\" in my mind. I used to be at a point (in college, when things were at their worst and I was underweight), where any solid food was \"bad\"; I would only consume things that were liquid at room temperature, because having to feel anything sitting in my stomach or upsetting my stomach (easy to do, as I've had a plethora of stomach issues since being a toddler) was too irritating and triggering to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow? I'm slowly feeling like I'm slipping back into that, because doctor after doctor can't tell me what's wrong with my stomach. Although I'm not sticking to a liquid only diet (I do have to admit, I miss how much of a cheap date I was when I'd go out with college friends, hehe), I am slipping back into the \"good\" food and \"bad food\" mindset. When I feel randomly sick and have to continue cancelling on people, it's easier just to.... not. I went to Chipotle with my boyfriend and got a simple salad bowl (salad, sofritas, beans, salsa, and fajita veggies), and about 20 minutes later was trying my hardest not to puke. All of my GI tests are (of course) coming back normal - the only thing that's come up is a redundant colon, but my GI doctor said that wouldn't cause any problems anyways. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo who knows? It's just so dang hard to stay in recovery when my body seems to hate most of the food I consume (cue IBS, nausea, severe abdominal pain from POTS etc; there is no diagnosis so doctors don't take me seriously/I end up really fighting just to eat a few times a day), and food still makes me feel odd when I can feel it sitting (versus sloshing) in my stomach.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Apparently the book was actually popularized in the 1970's, because it encouraged financial and romantic  independence for women. Anyway, the book outlines a strict 3 day menu that promises a loss of 5 pounds. That's it, only 3 days, plus you get to eat 3 times a day and you loose weight!?!? I love that people believed this. Oh wait, I forgot the best part, you not only get to drink on this \"diet\", but you need to drink a full bottle of wine every day!!!!!\n\nHere's the fabulous diet plan:  \nBreakfast - one hard boiled egg with a glass of white wine  and a cup of black coffee of course  \nLunch - another black coffee, 2 hard boiled eggs and a glass of white wine  \nDinner - a 5oz steak with a side of black coffee and the rest of your bottle of white wine\n\nThis sounds heavenly to me and I honestly wish I could do this even as a joke.

I just joined this group about 30 minutes ago and made this account 2 hours ago. This was the first community I wanted to join and for good reason. To introduce my broken body and mind to you all, I\u2019m 20 years old and a guy, currently attending college and am in Nursing school. How I managed to drag myself into as stressful of a major as this, we may never know. But recently my binge eating, has made me hit lows I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever felt before. I\u2019ve struggled with this mental addiction and issue for about 3 years now. I\u2019m not sure exactly how it started, but I would say it\u2019s due to an extreme diet I was on at about 15-16 years old. My life in terms of weight, well, has BEEN my life. It\u2019s been the #1 insecurity and issue in my mind. And I\u2019ve put myself through absolute hell both physically and mentally fighting this. I\u2019m not one who advocates bad diets, or as I just call them forced famines, but I respect and believe that we all need to do our best to eat a steady, and moderate diet along with a decent amount of exercise.....would be great to actually follow that eh? But being a dumb dumb younger me, I did just that. I weighed about 250lbs at 16, and by 17-18 dropped down to 150lbs. Did I do that in a healthy, and steady pace? HA! No, I basically starved myself down to that far too quickly and THAT, is when my binge eating began. I did good some months, bad others, and back and fourth on that cycle, and boy does it get tiring. I eventually hit the point where I knew I couldn\u2019t beat it alone, and eventually I got a therapist to help me get through it. For ANYONE struggling with this, I know its harder for some to receive therapy for all the reasons but please, do your best to find an option, having that kind of outlet has helped me tremendously. Lately though, I feel as though I\u2019ve stalled in my progress, and I decided that being apart of a community such as this, I could help, and be helped and supported through this journey together. As I sit here with my stomach full from my last night binge, I want to just say I understand how you guys feel, it\u2019s one of the worst feelings in the world and I know it is, but this is able to be beaten one way or another. A binge to me, is sitting around bored, stressed, tired, happy? Sad? Who cares, food is all over the place and it occupies your mind. I\u2019ve quit smoking and that was easier than this ever has been, its like a force that pulls you into it, and I don\u2019t truly believe willpower alone can stop it. You do your best to not give in but myself, I eventually do and let it beat me sometimes. You gain that moment of happiness as you chow down on that bag of Oreos you\u2019ve been eyeing since last week, all seems right, a massive release in your brain happens like you just realized you aced a final. And then...the aftermath, everyone here, you guys already know that feeling. I don\u2019t think I can compare many personal, emotional troubles to that of the aftermath of a binge for myself. I avoid mirrors, I don\u2019t want to move, I want to crawl into bed and avoid all responsibility. You feel like a shell of yourself, your head hurts, stomach hurts, you\u2019re shaking from what your body is trying to even process, and it\u2019s, debilitating. As grim as it is to type this out and describe it as that, that is MY story, and my way of expressing a binge, and maybe to some of you, you will relate to those same feelings. And maybe some of you won\u2019t but I want getting those feelings off your chest to feel easier, to feel good, to have a safe place for people who struggle with this. I\u2019m here to tell you all, that it\u2019s not all grim and dark, this is beatable in every way possible. That feeling food gives you is a temporary high that is gone quicker than the coffee you drink from your body in the morning. Finding joy in other activities, learning coping skills, improving every day is the true happiness we all need to be fighting for. I\u2019ve been on both sides and let me tell you, the food is NOT. WORTH.IT. But I know it\u2019s hard, I know it\u2019s easier said than done, but we all need to fight. If anyone wants to have somebody to talk to, please feel free to message me, and if anybody has any of their personal advice and coping mechanisms please share them! I fight this everyday, and I know you all do too, so I hope sharing my story here makes at least someone feel that they\u2019re truly not alone in their battle", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I binge just as much as your average person now say if I'm out at a restaurant and there's a lot of food or maybe munchies with some friends on the weekend but nothing more. This is NOT instructional this is just my story. \n\nHow it started. \n\nI was super depressed in grade 12 because I moved to a new school and the kids were dicks and I would binge to temporarily alleviate the depression. As you could imagine it only made it worse. I felt like I had no control when it was happening, guilty, and fat etc... it would typically happen when I got back from school or in between lunch breaks when no one was home. This lasted a year and at the time felt inescapable.\n\nHow it went away\n\nWhen summer rolled around I was so happy I didnt have to see the kids from Highschool anymore and I got a full time job in landscaping which I loved and I could focus on going to jiu jitsu in the evenings more than I could in Highschool because I didnt have homework. I stopped feeling the need to binge because I was in such a good headspace and also I didnt really get a chance to because the routine I was in didn't allow for it. Because I had to pack lunches and snacks for work so I ended up meal prepping. I prepped breakfasts, snacks, and lunches. Breakfasts because I wanted to reduce my morning time. Also I couldn't bingeat dinner because I typically ate with my family and also I didnt want to feel sick later when I'd do evening jiu jitsu. And after jiu jitsu I didnt want to eat too much because I didnt want to feel full in the morning and not be able to eat breakfast because then I would get hungry before lunch at work. So it fell into place.\n\nSince the change\n\nMy eating hasn't been perfect since but I deffinitely no longer have binge eating disorder. And when I do notice my eating is irregular it's a lot easier to shift it whereas before it felt emotionally draining to \"deny\" myself binges. It just feels like habit to stop at a comfortable amount of food. Relapses have happened but rarely\nI have had a smattering of emotional binges but nothing significant.\n\nSummary\n\nEstablishing a routine with built in endorphin release which consumes a lot of time is what helped me most. For me the most effective way to change my routine was money incentive as well as being in a loving community because I was paid to do landscaping which was physical labour outdoors with co-workers I got along with and I paid to go to jiu jitsu with people I who were also my friends that supported me and helped me grow.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I just don't want this to be the rest of my life because it absolutely demolshies my ability to dream and have ambitions and basically all I want every birthday eveyy Christmas every fuckung time I get to wish is to be skinny and I just don't want this anymore . Please someone give me advice I just hate feeling like this", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

She lost a massive amount of weight over the past 5 months, I\u2019m not sure how much exactly but the doctors didn\u2019t see that so they have decided to not take much notice in it.\n\nShe has admitted to me she is bulimic, after noticing little things like her sipping water constantly between meals, going to the bathroom after every meal, running taps whenever she went to the \u2018toilet\u2019. Eventually I went to speak to her and she broke down and had to open up to me.\nAfter a while she finally agreed to get help, so we went to the gp who\u2019s first comment was \u201cwell you\u2019re obviously not underweight\u201d ??? Who says that to a young girl who is there for that exact reason? Anyway, she just told us to watch her eating and told her to eat 3 meals a day and to return if we saw any drastic weight loss.\n\nObviously this only made things worse and she saw no point in getting help, she felt worse than before because even the doctor had pointed out her weight. \nAfter a few weeks of research we got a referral to speak to somebody at CAHMS (child and adolescent mental health services). The initial appointment went well and she scheduled her an appointment with an ED specialist to weigh her and talk through her eating habits etc... \nAND AGAIN, before he weighed her, before he even spoke to her his initial comment was \u201cyou\u2019re noticeably not underweight\u201d.\n\nWHY? Is this a normal thing? I don\u2019t understand how health professionals, even those who specialise in the illness can be so insensitive.\n\nDoes anybody have any suggestions on where we can actually get help and not accentuate the problem? Worried as although she is not yet an unhealthy weight, the affects bulimia has on your body aside from the weight loss are extremely serious. She has complained of cramps in her chest a few times over the past month and I\u2019m worried it\u2019s going to turn into something worse than it already is.\n\nIt\u2019s not often somebody actually builds courage to ask for help and they just aren\u2019t taking it seriously.\n\nThank you!!!!", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

As I got a reply saying that I was most likely right, I started trying to stop it getting worse. I thought it\u2019d go away if I just ignored the thoughts and forced myself to eat normally but it\u2019s not going how I thought it would.\n\nAt first adjust to eating normally was really hard, I was able to convince myself to start eating breakfasts again quite easily, but it was lunch that was a real issue since I\u2019d been denying myself them for nearly 3 weeks now. I remember on the first day that I made myself have 3 meals, I was in a constant state of anxiety throughout the whole day, I was only able to make myself eat half my breakfast, and then at lunch I couldn\u2019t do it and had to make something much smaller than I originally intended. I even nearly had a panic attack about a pear drop a friend gave me.\n\nAfter that though, things started getting a bit easier, and now I can eat much more normally without forcing myself so much, but I\u2019m still getting huge amounts of guilt after eating even just a normal sized meal, and I often feel physically sick after some meals, even though they aren\u2019t really bigger than anything I used to eat before this started. I\u2019m always really anxious about making myself eat, and I can\u2019t think about food outside of when I eat my meals or I start feeling sick with worry.\n\nA 4 days ago though, this really weird thing happened. My appetite just completely disappeared. Totally. I don\u2019t feel any desire to eat or anything anymore. I can still tell when I should be hungry as I can feel when my stomach is empty, but it\u2019s not like normal; if I didn\u2019t make myself eat, I wouldn\u2019t want to. Now I have to make sure I eat 3 times a day deliberately since I just have no desire to eat.\n\nI\u2019m also finding that as I\u2019ve been trying to make myself eat normally, the ED\u2019s voice seems to be getting quieter, and I\u2019m hearing it less. But as this is happening, my depression has been getting worse, and that\u2019s making me feel worse than I ever did while I was letting myself develop the ED.\n\nI spend so much time just lying in bed feeling... nothing. I don\u2019t have any motivation, I don\u2019t feel happy, I don\u2019t feel sad... I just want to sleep. Whenever I\u2019m like that, I keep feeling these new thoughts, telling me I should go back to the way I was acting before, and listen to the ED\u2019s voice again. When I was doing that, I always felt so in control, it made me happy as I felt like I was doing the right thing, even know I know I wasn\u2019t. So why do I keep wanting to go back to it!? I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s so strange...\n\nIs this normal? Am I doing the right thing by forcing myself to eat normally?

This made me eat a lot of fast food to feel better about myself. i always wanted to just stop eating but i couldn\u2019t control myself.

In this time I thought I could get attention or be interesting if I was depressed and despised my body or restricted. In hindsight this was absolutely awful, yes, and now at 18 I know much better and, well, I've actually been diagnosed with depression but anyway, onto the ed stuff.\n\nAfter the tumblr phase I realized that 1) I don't hate my body 2) there's nothing wrong with my body 3) I love food and 4) of course, having an ed or pretending to have one isn't quirky. So for a while everything was great, I was aware of some things that could be better, but overall self love was at its peak, at least about my body.\n\nThen a year ago I started questioning my gender and dysphoria came into play. I won't talk about that I'll just say that this put me in dispute with my body again, but not in a \"I want to lose weight\" or whatever way, but in that gender way. As in, if I was a cis girl, I'd probably still adore my body.\n\nAnd now we're here. That friend I mentioned in the beginning? They used to rant to me about their ed (because I wanted to help in any way I can and they said that ranting helps) but I had to ask them to stop because their rants started triggering some thoughts...\n\nI started wanting to restrict for no apparent reason. I'm not about numbers, this is something that stayed with me from my self love phase as I was highly against strictly monitoring ones weight etc (unless it's for physical health purposes and such) and I still don't care about that. I don't weigh myself very often. But there's this guilt whenever I eat, I feel like I've done something terrible and should be punished for it (not when I overeat, when I eat *at all*). This feeling of guilt will appear in episodes, usually relating to my depressive episodes, however it terrifies me because it seems to be stronger every time it returns.\n\nI haven't restricted seriously until yesterday, I always either gave in or was forced to eat because of being checked up on by family members.

And that's how I've been feeling, that I've lost all my progress and I'm just fat again. All of my pants are tight now and I remember how they used to be lose. And it freaks me out.\n\nMy counselor talked to me about how weight gain is normal during recovery because your body is readjusting to having sufficient food to eat, and that weight might spike but then even out as you make it through the process. My ED kept telling me, 'what if she's lying so that you won't go on a diet again', so I decided to do a bit of research on weight gain during recovery and found this article, which says the same thing.\n\nOne of the main things it talks about is how, during recovery, gaining weight is part of the process, but it's one of the hardest things to cope with because it *seems* like it affirms the fear of getting fat that one was trying to avoid. It says that it can take months, and even a *year* for your body to completely adjust and settle into a healthy normal weight for your body, and during that time your weight will probably fluctuate and things like that. It seems like a crazy long time and my mind starts to freak out thinking about it, and I know this is going to be hard.\n\nI just wanted to share this with everyone struggling with recovery, to show us, that if we stick to recovery and normal eating, that the end goal will be better than relapsing into dieting and restriction. \n\n[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hunger-artist/201110/the-physical-effects-weight-gain-after-starvation](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hunger-artist/201110/the-physical-effects-weight-gain-after-starvation)\n\nI say this to myself as well--hang in there everyone.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I want to go back down to my regular high restriction so, so badly. Hell, I want to go to lower restriction just to shut my brain up and see the number on the scale go down again.\n\nHas anyone else felt this way when slowly increasing their intake? What did you do about it? Did it get better?", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

{"post_id": "dzmwmg", "created_utc": 1574358351, "title": "Good treatment experiences!", "author": "th3sinn3r", "self_text": "I\u2019ve been in recovery for about 3 years now and I wanted to share my positive experience at a treatment center that really allowed me to grow and heal. If anyone else has positive experiences with eating disorder treatment I\u2019d love to hear it! I feel like I hear the negative experiences more often than positive ones. I remember how discouraging that was and it made me feel like no matter where I went there wasn\u2019t hope. So I\u2019d love to hear your positive experiences too! \n\n3 years ago I was struggling so badly with my eating disorder and I thought I would never recover. I couldn\u2019t see my life without weighing myself every day and living for a lower number on that scale. I was hospitalized multiple times for health complications and during that final hospitalization, I was given an ultimatum by my family. I could either go to treatment or I\u2019d be homeless (which was fair because they knew I\u2019d never take that second option and I was an absolute nightmare to be around). \n\nI picked treatment. First, my parents tried to get me in wherever they could, but I was insistent upon going to Oliver-Pyatt Centers (OPC) in Miami. It was the best decision I ever made. I am sure there are many other wonderful places, that\u2019s why I\u2019d like to hear your experiences too. I just only have experience with OPC and local place that no longer exists (because it wasn\u2019t very good).\n\nWhen I got to OPC I was terrified. The first two months of treatment were by far the worst. Weight restoring was hard as shit, but it made it easier to be surrounded by people going through the same type of hell I was. The food was delicious. All of it was prepared at OPC. The meals were always different and at OPC they didn\u2019t do the exchange system. They follow intuitive eating and that is by far one of the most valuable tools that I still use today. The intuitive eating system allowed me to learn what my body was saying when I had been ignoring it for so long. I learned what hunger cues were and I also learned what it was like to feel full, sit with that without using any compensatory behaviors. \n\nThey never made the women that didn\u2019t complete meals or a snack drink a replacement shake. Instead, as a consequence you wouldn\u2019t be allowed to participate in movement activities or attend daily outings to the store or park. It was like a natural consequence. If you don\u2019t nourish yourself, you won\u2019t be able to do normal activities, which makes sense. \n\nThere were also different programs. They had co-occurring for people with substance abuse disorders and a special group for people with BED so they could have extra support. It was all incredibly individualized.\n\nOn the weekends we had a meal outing at a restaurant, and it was like relearning how to enjoy food and company again. At first the meal outings were dreaded, but they grew into something to look forward to. Just like going out with my family before I ever struggled with food. \n\nAs I got better, the level of rules and restrictions dropped. I was allowed on planned outings and eventually moved into the transitional living program after 4 months. I was still living in OPC housing and had a curfew, and I was at the IOP center 5 days a week. I was cooking my own meals and had job too. Most of the women volunteered or worked as well. The goal was to prepare us to take care of ourselves on our own. \nAfter about 3 months of TLP I moved into a non-OPC apartment for 2 months. I still attended IOP, but I was also working and fostering friendships outside of OPC at that point. My life started to feel like it was more than just my eating disorder or recovery. \n\nI left the program in December 2016 and stayed to work until January. \n\nSince then, I\u2019ve moved back home to North Florida. It hasn\u2019t always been easy. I definitely still struggle with my body image and have days where I do want to engage in behaviors, but it\u2019s so much easier to resist now. I\u2019ve built a life for myself that I want to fight for. I can\u2019t imagine my life with anorexia now. I don\u2019t want to be that sick again, it genuinely scares me. Every time where I feel negatively about myself and think about engaging in behaviors I think about the 9 months of treatment and how much work I put into that. I also think of how helpless my ED made me feel and how long it took for me to feel strong and in control again. \n\nI feel so solid in recovery and I know I owe that to the personal work I\u2019ve done on myself, but also to OPC. They had so much compassion and empathy. The therapists were all wonderful, the recovery coaches were wise and attentive and took NO SHIT. The program was set up with so much thought and care on how to best prepare everyone for life outside OPC. It definitely had highs and lows and I didn\u2019t always love it there. I also NEVER want to go back unless it\u2019s to visit, but I love that place. They helped give me my life back.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

When I look at myself in the mirror it looks like I've ate a ten year old. I'm unhappy with where I'm at and yet every time I try to diet and exercise I get thrown off track and it's really demoralizing because I gain even more weight than I had before. (quick note: I almost always eat when I am depressed, lonely, worried, angry, and/ or bored)\n\nIn all honesty, sometimes I think of divorcing my husband because he tends to sabotage me more than anyone else when it comes to living a healthy lifestyle and I've started to resent him. I'm just not sure what to do anymore. We live in an area where fast food is the norm and good food isn't good quality or affordable. My dearest friend, who has always been a healthy weight, is worried about me because I don't look good. At this point, I don't leave the house anymore without someone with me (or late at night) because I cannot stand the anxiety of being seen in public.\n\nAs of this week, I have an indoor bike coming in the mail which I will put in front of the TV and I will try to use it towards increasing my health. Along with that, I have a vegan protein meal replacement shake and chicken breasts + frozen veg mix that I can steam. I'm not sure if meal prepping would be the better option. Husband tends to complain when he has the same thing too often but I don't mind similar foods. He also bought alcohol and pizzas after I asked him not to and I'm worried that I won't have the willpower to tell him no if he offers to share. \n\nWhile I hate my body and I know self-control is difficult for me - I love the smell of unhealthy foods, the flavor and bubblyness of soda, and general sweets. I'm not sure if this is a good enough start but I really want to succeed this time.

Apologized to all the staff that dealt with me that day, and then met with my therapist. Basically they told me that now if I sign out 3 more times then I have to leave the program-- this is supposed to be incentive for me to stay and be emotional there instead of running away and isolating myself as usual. \n\nSo that kinda sucks.\n\nThis week has been a fucking rollercoaster. Went ice skating for the first time in one of our groups, freaked out because I was the only one clinging to the railing the entire time, then sat on a bench and cried for most of the day. \n\nApparently one of our therapists used to skate there a lot, but stopped skating to focus on school or something-- I overheard 2 ladies talking about her while I was waiting for everyone else to come off the ice, and they were kinda rude. They couldn't believe she quit skating to go to school, then said \"guess they can't all be like Nathan Chen.\" (apparently a figure skater who went to Yale while also skating and going on to the Olympics). They talked about her for like 10+ minutes. It shouldn't have bothered me so much but it really did. I told myself not to say anything to them, but as we were walking to our van, one of the ladies followed us out and to her own car and I kinda loudly told one of the other therapists with us that she was a bitch while the woman was still within earshot.\n\nI feel like a major asshole. I'm usually *much* more controlled with my emotions. I rarely cry (and *never* in front of others), I minimize my anger pretty constantly, internalize everything, and made an art out of invalidating my emotions. I don't know what got into me. I'm convinced I've got borderline personality disorder or something and I don't know how I can ever talk to that therapist again knowing my words likely had a negative relational impact and I should've been more considerate of that before opening my dumb face. \n\n...Otherwise, treatment has been good! I'm trying to be more social in groups, talking to the new clients that came in this week, eating more.

So, my relationship with BED has been HARD - the constant forcing of food when I\u2019m not hungry and then feeling terrible about myself afterwards. It wasn\u2019t great for my mental state and it felt like I would be stuck like that forever. I put on close to 6kg from just binging and I felt terrible. \n\nPreviously, my boyfriend and I had ended what was a 3 year long relationship. We we\u2019re doing distance and it ended because of the distance being too hard. I was really upset about it and also feared that I would drive back into eating my feelings away and binging. But, for some reason it\u2019s like my hunger has been settled. I eat normal meals, I don\u2019t crave anything more than feeling full, I don\u2019t constantly think about food anymore and most importantly I don\u2019t binge eat. It\u2019s such a strange feeling and I realised it was because the distance was making me crave food because I was missing something. I can\u2019t believe I never clocked it before. I was eating to fill a void inside of me. Now that that\u2019s been done - there\u2019s nothing for me to want to fill. \n\nPoint being, try to figure out what it is that is causing you hurt that you feel the need to binge - I know this is hard and sometimes it\u2019s impossible to tell. But, perhaps some reflection can kick start the thought process to understanding how you can over come binge eating. I hope this helps! \n\nReminder: you will not be stuck with BED!!

Thanks for your time!\n\nTitle: Does anyone else experience periods of addiction to certain foods? \n\nI\u2019ve been treated for a EDNOS (Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified) and have been in a 30 day program at an ED facility once before (7 years ago). I have gradually fallen off the promising recovery wagon since my stay seven years ago in a facility. I don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t commit anything, it\u2019s always been an issue for me. Maybe part of not taking care of myself stems from self-esteem; I sometimes equate worthiness with eating healthy foods. I was diagnosed with EDNOS because I tend to binge and restrict (not nearly to the point of anorexia, it more has to do with being able to comfortably eat alone and control things), have weird eating patterns, and exhibit some ritualistic behavior with food, emotionally eat, and so forth. \n\nI\u2019m thinking my phases of being addicted to certain food is part of my ED. Right now, I\u2019m practically addicted to Panda Express (same order every time and sweet &amp; sour sauce is an essential staple of this meal for me); I fluctuate between that and a certain meal from McDonald\u2019s. In the past it\u2019s been a specific meal at KFC, McDonald\u2019s, Arby\u2019s, etc. I shouldn\u2019t even be spending money on food, I\u2019m honestly too poor.

Now, 2 days have passed, I'm still randomly passing out at night from the exhaustion, even though I'm eating 2 300-400kcal meals a day. What the fuck is going on? I'm monitoring my vitamin intake to be sufficient every single day. Help. I can't learn for school any more, since my brain doesn't seem to work. I eat and I'm still exhausted every single day. I get these suicidal thoughts because of it. I'm useless. Can't do school, can't lose weight, can't think and can't starve.

I am recovering from restrictive eating and I\u2019m seeing a dietian and therapist. Because my dietian has been making me eat 3x more then I was I\u2019ve gained some weight. She told me the weight was temporary but it\u2019s been 2 months now and it\u2019s not going anywhere. It\u2019s making me super depressed and I feel myself wanting to go back into my old ways because it seemed to be working before. I\u2019ve told this to both my therapist and dietian but they always brush it off or when I ask my dietian how can I safely lose weight she just starts talking about how it\u2019s normal for our bodies to change at this age and that we need to learn to accept it. But I can\u2019t accept it. I may not look \u201cfat\u201d to most people but I\u2019m much heavier then I used to be and my goal weight is not under weight it\u2019s just average for my height (right now I feel like I\u2019m on the edge of being average weight/over weight). I\u2019m so frustrated that I can\u2019t get any guidance from them over this. Also I try to work out but because I\u2019m so depressed about my body it takes everything in me to make it to the gym or off the couch after work so if I\u2019m lucky I\u2019ll only go twice a week. It\u2019s also triggering for me to go to the gym sometimes when I see really fit and beautiful people. I just don\u2019t know what to do. I read somewhere once that weight loss is mainly diet but with the amount of food they have me eating I don\u2019t see how I could ever lose weight. I also eat pretty healthy (I\u2019m vegetarian and don\u2019t eat a lot of junk/sweets). So does anyone have any kind of advice or have been through something similar?

Pretty much any protein food I might ever eat is a fear food for me for one reason or another. I've had doctors call me out that I need to be eating more protein, even outside of the context of an ED/doctors who don't know I have one, it always shows up somehow in my bloodwork, but I just don't. Even when I binge I shun protein (and don't even get me started on fat \ud83d\ude29.) I eat carbs. That's it.\n\nBut I recently found a vegan protein bar that's 22g of protein, only 190 calories (less than 200! For a protein bar! With 22 freaking grams of protein!), reasonably priced and easy to find, and I like the taste of.\n\nAnd it's like... Revolutionary. I eat one at least a couple times a week (I want to eat one a day but that kind of scares me still ngl) and I like... Genuinely feel full throughout the day even if I'm restricting. I obviously still think about food a lot, but it's not quite as omnipresent. And I don't wake up in the morning want to die because I feel so bad from restricting. And I can exercise (something I do for genuinely non-ED reasons) and actually recover, even be active multiple days in a row and feel good on all of them, rather than wallowing in ache and fatigue and suffering for weeks until I completely crash or get really injured and *have* to stop for an extended time. \n\nI'm almost assuredly still not eating enough protein. But I'm definitely doing better than I was.\n\nAnd on some level I'm worried it's emboldening, or going to embolden, me. Because a lot of things that I thought were just the consequences of restriction are apparently moreso the consequence of protein deficiency, which means that this discovery has removed some of the barriers to me restricting even more and more often than I already do.\n\nBut at the end of the day like. It's been like two, maybe three weeks of regularly eating protein bars and there is such a clear and drastic difference between how I feel when I eat one and how I feel when I don't and how I felt before I discovered them and I am so grateful for them for giving me even a moment's peace from feeling awful.

Because I get so hungry that I don't function properly anymore. I eat because I don't have any control over it. Because at some point my body just listens to its instinct, ignores my brain and eats. \nIf I was eating because I wanted to recover I could rationalise the ed thoughts. You're not weak. You're trying to recover. But that's not how I feel. I just feel like the ed is right. I am weak. I can't even follow my own rules. I feel super dumb. And I feel guilty. I feel like I'm responsible for all this shit. Like I chose to be ill. I just want to cry.", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

I'm trying really hard not to focus on my weight, but it's so hard when it's the main source of my low self-esteem. I keep creating this narrative that I'll be happy once I'm back to my old weight.

She told me to try and stop counting calories until our next appointment (one month) so that I could see that my body is able to self regulate (since it's not like i have any emotional reason to overeat normally) and that my gut is to be trusted. \n\nMy first week I still weighed everything and tried to keep at a deficit. Now I'm letting a bit more loose. I ate 2 plates of white pasta with garlic oil and pepper for dinner (after intense rugby play) and THEN I bought a pastry at this place I love and where I only crash to eat when wasted. Only ate half, the rest is my snack for tomorrow. The rest of the day I ate normally and healthy but still stuff I really like (potato pancakes, roasted cauliflower, bread and butter). But I'm still counting. More relaxed, more vague, more room for error, since I stopped weighing my food - but I'm still slightly obsessing. \n\nGood thing: my appetite seems to be back! I had lost it, with my joy for food (replaced by anxiety - how many calories are in there?!). \nLess good thing: I still don't get physical hunger cues. Sometimes I'll act on my mental hunger, and I always eat when I feel like it/it's time, trying to stay in 3 meals and one snack, but I haven't yet sat down at the table to eat Hungry. So I kinda struggle understanding when to stop, and I'll kinda eat everything I feel like eating until my calorie counting skills don't kick in telling me that I've probably reached my limit for that meal, and I should stop eating to avoid going over.\nLast 2 days I overate a little bit, and I can't help but thinking about my calorie intake/outtake to avoid feeling bad about it, since, were I to count, Ive probably been right on maintenance these days. But i feel like even the simple fact that I know this is a defeat in what I'm trying to do.\n\nIt's really difficult doing this while still wanting to lose weight. I don't know yet what I want from my body, but I'm Just happy i can again enjoy eating what I like.\n\nThanks for reading this far if you made it", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

It\u2019s sucked and it\u2019s been miserable but I\u2019m tired of, well, feeling miserable all the time. I\u2019m tired of letting people down, and I\u2019m tired of hurting people I love with how I constantly hurt myself.\n\nThis morning in the shower I had an unexpected wave of some unknown emotion and just totally broke down. No idea why. And I\u2019ve been mulling it over for the last hour or so. \n\nI think I\u2019m beginning to understand a big part of why my ED is so hard to shake. I think I\u2019m clinging onto the feeling of being neglected as a child and part of me wants to finally be taken care of the way I never was when I really needed it. I think the way I neglect myself is in part because it\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known and in part because I want someone to see how I\u2019m struggling, see the pain I\u2019m in, and be there for me.\n\nBut as an adult, that\u2019s not something I can healthily attain. I can\u2019t have someone else take care of me. I know that, and I\u2019m okay with that. I\u2019ve just had my ED for most of my stupid life and I feel like I\u2019m starting to get more of a grip of what underlying reason always lets it creep back into my life. I know EDs are rooted in trauma 9 times out of 10, and I\u2019ve known mine is for sure rooted in trauma and have for a while. I\u2019ve just always come up at a loss for what *exactly* in me is unresolved. Prior I\u2019d always thought it was because the people who hurt me stunted my self image at a very young age, made me feel unworthy and useless, but now I\u2019m thinking my ED has a lot more to do with a neglected inner child desperately wanting to be nurtured. I feel like inside all I am is a baby crying for their parents.\n\nAnyway. Idk if any of that made sense. Just venting.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

If you're planning on purging spicy food, drink milk during the 'binge' to help negate capsaicin. It won't completely stop the burning but it reduces it noticeably. \n\nii. Don't drink water as a liquid in order to help you purge. In my experience, it will try to separate itself from the rest of the stomach contents, making the actual food harder to bring up. It will also make whatever that does come up taste bitter and sour. Instead, milk or cola are better (the latter to break larger chunks of food especially thick bread and doughs which tend to clump). \n\niii. Don't binge chocolate on its own- it is dense and without a 'vehicle' to dissolve it like milk or ice cream, will be difficult to bring up and burn your throat with its over-sweetness.\n\niv. To dispel a (somewhat? past?) common misconception- marker foods are not reliable. Simple sugars like pure candy are absorbed first whilst dense food like mushroom or edamame can stay at the bottom of your stomach (for up to 10+ hours in my experience).\n\nv. 'Flushing' was ineffective for me. Barely brought up any more food, left me feeling twice as dead afterwards. \n\nvi. The most effective thing to replenish electrolytes/ energy after purging for me is melon fingers, miso soup, coconut water.  \n\nPlease add more 'tips' of your own if you have some", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

{"post_id": "e0f94a", "created_utc": 1574497989, "title": "I feel too self-aware to have an eating disorder", "author": "FauxKinkajou", "self_text": "I don't really know how to start this. I might have an eating disorder.\n\nI remember around the age of 11 I was upstairs at my grandparents house watching my 14 year old brother play games on the computer. At some point while I was watching him, he found an image of a person who I guess at the time was considered the person with the highest ever recorded weight. He sent the picture in an email to my mom with a subject line that was something along the lines of \"don't show this to \\[my name\\]\". There may have been text in the body of the email, too. But it was clear that it was kind of mocking the fact that I had gained weight when I got into middle school.\n\nAnother memory from 6th grade. I was walking down a hallway at school when I noticed that my favorite shirt was starting to get tight on me. At that point, I was probably higher end of the normal BMI range, maybe slightly overweight. But I felt so self-conscious and hated my body. I was incredibly uncomfortable about my weight all throughout middle school. I never took off my clothes in our PE locker room at school. I hated that people saw my body and was scared to take off my clothes. I hated being the fat friend. I don't remember being bullied about my weight by peers, but I felt like I internalized the bullying that I expected to receive. I bullied myself in my head a lot.\n\nAt some point I started gaining a lot more weight. I would eat lots of food late at night, especially over the summer when I could stay up late and not really worry about school the next day. I would eat an entire frozen pizza by myself. I was also pretty sedentary. I gained a lot of weight and by the beginning of high school I was morbidly obese. I don't know my height but at the time I was definitely an inch or two shorter than my mom, so I estimate my BMI was around 37-38.\n\nAt one point my dad sat me down and gave me a talk about my weight issues. He talked about how he had weight issues growing up but was never as heavy as I was. I don't remember the rest of the conversation but that's stuck with me forever. My dad wasn't mean to me in the conversation, I think he just didn't know how to handle it tactfully.\n\nThings kind of went the same for a few years. At the beginning of my junior year of high school, I was in a class that had a bunch of iPads that we got to use every class. We were supposed to use them for research, note-taking, all that jazz... but I used my iPad time to look at dieting information online, and pictures of people who'd lost a lot of weight. After I saw that stuff, I decided that I was going to start a diet so I could lose weight. \n\nI decided to do the keto diet but didn't tell anybody that I was starting it. I was able to hide the fact that I was doing it from my family for a few weeks, but then we went out to eat dinner and I couldn't eat the bread on my sandwich and my mom found out that I was dieting. I don't know why I didn't just tell her I was dieting upfront when I started. I guess I felt kind of embarrassed that I even had to diet in the first place..?\n\nSo, I was doing the keto diet and lost maybe 20 lbs in the first month. And I don't really know when I did it, but I think at some point I started counting calories. I don't really remember all that well. I lost about 40 lbs in 3 months, and then I stopped dieting. I gained about 10 lbs back over the course of the following Spring semester. I stayed at that weight until the following August. \n\nMy family was on a road trip coming home from another state. We had stopped at a rest stop and I was hungry so I went through the snacks that we had in the car. Everyone else was in the bathroom inside, so I was alone in the car just browsing on my phone and about to eat a cheese stick. I think while we had been driving for the past few hours I had my phone with me and I was reading (don't judge me please) pro ana type stuff on Tumblr and Reddit and other websites. Anyways, I I remember holding the cheese stick in my hand and deciding that I wasn't going to eat it.\n\nSo, I started dieting and I told my parents that I was going on the keto diet again. I lost 40 lbs in 3 months again. Both times that I dieted people would compliment me constantly and act completely shocked when they saw me (in a good way). I had been obese for so long and during the second round of dieting, I was finally in the normal BMI range. I didn't get to a super low weight, but one time my mom's friend was saying hi to me and then dead serious she said something like: \"You've lost a lot of weight, you need to stop now.\" And that freaked me out a lot because she was so stern when she said it and I'd never heard her like that. I kind of got scared that she thought I had an eating disorder and so I decided to stop dieting so that she and my mom wouldn't be suspicious.\n\nAlso I guess I should mention that during the second time I was dieting I was spending a lot of time at night reading weight loss tips on eating disorder blogs. And also reading a lot of informational stuff about eating disorders like on health websites and stuff. I was using eating disorder symptoms to lose weight but I was doing it deliberately so I didn't think that it could be a real eating disorder. Like, rationally I knew that eating disorder = bad. But I was conscious of the fact that I was just using eating disorder stuff as a weight loss tool, so it wasn't a genuine eating disorder.\n\nA few years later I was in college. My brother got diagnosed with cancer and died three months later. A month after that, his girlfriend (who my family was incredibly close with) and my mom decided to start going on runs together. And they were also trying to eat healthier, so I decided to diet again too. I didn't really do it out of a weight concern, I felt like it was more a competitive thing. I wanted to lose the most weight, the fastest, almost like I was showing off. Because I'd gotten a lot of positive feedback in the past and everyone knew that I was really good at weight loss (even though I felt guilty about lying to everyone that it was the keto diet; I kind of followed the keto rules, but I was mostly restricting calories).\n\nSo another year passed and I gained about 20 lbs back. When I was about to hit the overweight BMI range I decided to lose weight again. That was near the end of my junior year of college. I tried desperately to lose weight, but whenever I would restrict like I used to, I would always cave in and eat something the next day. I was stuck like that for the entire Spring semester and throughout the summer.\n\nOver the summer I was still living in my college town and doing an internship. There was a restaurant near my house that I was addicted to. It was super, super heavy food that I always felt super guilty eating. I would restrict and restrict until I couldn't stop thinking about anything but that restaurant, so I would go there and get a huge meal, take it back to my house and eat half of it. For most of the summer I would just eat half and then give away the leftover to friends so that I wouldn't eat anymore. I don't remember when I started doing it but I eventually was eating it and then would make myself throw up. I would do that once or twice a week for about 2 months.\n\nIn the Fall semester of my senior year I was able to restrict without having to throw up, and lost about 40 lbs over the course of 4 months. I ended up just barely crossing the threshold into being underweight, but I didn't stay there. When I was at my lowest weight it was near the holidays and I was home with my family and my mom seemed to clearly know that I was being weird about my weight, and whenever she'd hug me she'd run her fingers on my shoulder blade, or my ribs, or whatever part of my body and then she'd say \"you're skin and bones\". But I didn't really feel that I was actually skinny because my stomach was still flabby (partly because I have loose skin from when I was heavier). I know that body dysmorphia is a symptom of EDs but I legitimately looked normal. I gained back 30 lbs over the next 6 or 7 months.\n\nAnd over the past 2.5 months I've kind of been restricting again. I wouldn't eat breakfast most days, and I would sometimes skip lunch, and then I would eat a weird, chaotic dinner (e.g. 5 tortillas, some tomato sauce, and soup, or whatever weird combo of food I had in my pantry). I started because I was trying to lose weight, with the plan to gain it back so that I could weight cycle. I'm a trans girl, and I'd read that weight cycling is good once you're on estrogen to help redistribute body fat. I've also been feeling really negative thoughts about my eating patterns and spending *hours* every day poring over eating disorder recovery stuff online. \n\nRight now I'm eating normally but I'm torn. On the one hand, my rational brain is thinking: if I read this as somebody else's story, I'd 100% think that they had an eating disorder. But because it's my story, I have some kind of mental blockade. Like, I know how much intentional effort I spent on losing weight, and because of that I feel like this couldn't be a real eating disorder. Because I wanted to lose weight, and I did it deliberately. If I had an eating disorder, I feel like it would somehow be different...or more clear? I am completely lost.\n\nIf you read all of this, thank you for listening. I know I should probably go talk to a therapist, but I have a fear that they'll think I'm making this up. What do I do?", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

Or maybe into a plastic bag. It's interesting how my symptoms have developed throughout my ED, objectively. I started off never binging and low restricting, then high restricting and binging hard on weekends but rarely purging, and now I purge constantly. I don't really binge, my biggest are 1000kcal at a time but it is enough food in volume to make me full. It's addicting and I can't stop. I keep binging because I'm ravenous, I've recently hit a LW and have maintained with only 0.7kg left to lose for almost two weeks now. I like the way my body looks, but am constantly bloated because of the purging. I haven't gained any weight because I purge 90% of it and even if I only purged half of it I'd wind up hitting only a little above maintenance. Today I got myself some low cal ice cream as a treat, peanut butter and only 350kcal for the whole pint, yet I felt so full I had to purge. I feel terrible because a close family member is suffering from a very serious medical condition that won't get any better. It's terminal. And I'm over here choosing to put my health in jeopardy while she has no control over hers. I am so so selfish. And all because I want to be thin and can't eat like a goddamn normal person.

Our company has begun to support an elderly lady within her home in the last month - she has MS but other than this is sound of mind with no other ailments.\n\nI've only met this woman a few times prior and there's no mention of an ED on any records. We often come in on the next call to find she hasn't touched her food left for her from the previous call (she is perfectly capable of feeding herself jfc this has been ruled out), but other than encouraging her/providing high nourishment meals/documenting this we see this often and cannot force her to eat.\n\nYesterday I came to her bed call to find her family sat with her, the family mentioned that she (reluctantly) ate whilst sat with them, to which I said was good, as she hadn't eaten any of her lunch/drank any of her drinks that day.\n\nThis was the point where the daughter flipped her shit and started shouting at her mum. It turns out her mum had lied and said she'd eaten well all day (the family didn't check our notes detailing her meal records and her mum is still sound of mind). The daughter was really angry at her mum, getting in her face, saying she's 'dealt with this long enough' and saying she'll have to go into a care home before long if she doesn't start eating and the threat of being force fed etc. The daughter later went on to tell me that even when she was a kid (this woman is 40+ so we're talking 1960's/1970's) they never had a sit down meal with their mum, she always chose cigarettes and coffee over meals and has always been conscious of her weight. We have been also been told by our managers to check the woman's handbag at mealtimes as she has been known to hide food in her handbag to make it look like she's eaten/newspaper rack has to be moved away from her to prevent her from wrapping her food up and chucking/hoarding it.\n\nI asked the daughter if her mum had ever been diagnosed with an ED as this has clearly been happening for years - she said no, and felt a diagnosis would be useless at this point.\n\nMy post is pointless other than saying that it makes me angry that support for ED's among many other mental health illnesses are only becoming more prevalent now, even though there's a fuck ton of myths still hanging around about them despite eating disorders having the highest mortality rate of mental health disorders. It makes me angry that if someone had paid attention to this woman's habits years ago, intervention could've happened rather than this woman being chastised for not eating. There's years of disorder there that would need to be tackled with years of therapy - a longer amount of time needed to tackle it than I'd imagine this woman will be alive unfortunately. This woman has probably carried this around with her for years and no one has batted an eyelid due to a) lack of awareness/support of ED's b) societal/generational pressures on women (I don't want to generalise, but I can imagine skipping meals was even encouraged by other people when this woman was younger to 'stay slim'). \n\nWe seem to forgot about minorities having ED's for whatever reason, e.g disordered habits may be assumed to be part of their bigger mental/physical illness, communication barriers, those with physical disabilities may generally have less appetite due to less physical exertion - you get the picture. It's often overlooked (even as someone with an ED, I've never stopped to consider an elderly person with a disability having one) and idk, I just needed a good rant about it whilst raising awareness.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I am upset, angry, regretful, and confused as hell.*\n\nSo, I have been vegan for quite a while. Since 2010 I've been vegetarian, and since 2014 or so vegan....., and it's something I am very passionate about - not at all tied to my ED (I know for some it can be, so I wanted to clarify). I have had one period since 2010 where I slipped up/wondered if it was for me. And that period? Merely solidified my decisions.  However, I've recently been craving cheese (which I've never had before), and just now had a small handful of it, because I got sick of fighting that impulse! I know that in terms of my health there is nothing wrong with that (aka, I know it's okay if I don't want to be vegan anymore), however, I can't figure out why I have this crazy craving for cheese! I am wondering if it is something physically based, like something \"off\" with my intake. Lately, I've been getting enough fat, a lot of protein, fiber, and a healthy amount of carbs. Yet? I'm still craving it like crazy.   \n\n\nIf you are vegan, please don't judge me for this- because whatever you have to say can't be worse than what I've said to myself. I feel so much regret and anger, yet I can't figure out what is going on! I am very hesitant to go to a nutritionist too, as my last few experiences with nutritionists and doctors regarding my veganism have been horrific. Regardless of whether or not I mention my ED, they are very resistant - including ones that previously told me they were vegan friendly. I try very hard to be healthy, yet still balanced and mindfully (so I don't trigger my Anorexia or Binge Eating D/o back into action), yet so many doctors have told me that I can't be healthy unless I eat \"eggs/cheese/chicken/milk/honey/etc.\", ever. Which is not what the research says, and so far for me, has not at all been the case (if anything quite the opposite).... so I am hesitant to see a doctor over this, unless it gets worse. My most recent bloodworm has been pristine, and I've been meeting with a GI doctor a lot who has been also keeping an eye on my nutrition. \n\nI may cross post this to the vegan sub, but I'm hesitant to as well.... since my past experiences there have been rather black/white - I feel like they may not fully comprehend why I'd rather eat a small bite of cheese, than start the cascading thoughts of \"I can just restrict\".", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

In the past I would obsessively and strictly count my calories, if I ate anything that wasn't \"healthy\" I would run it off. So if I ate a cookie, I would go running for 15-20 minutes. I kept a journal to log my food and wouldn't let myself eat more than 1000 calories a day. I had that mindset where if it's not healthy, I can't eat it even if it would technically fit in with my calories for the day. \n\nI finally got past it and formed a relatively healthy relationship with food. Then a few years ago I experienced a really traumatic experience, got depressed and started binge eating. I never purged but would constantly come home and binge and eat everything in my house and wished I could purge and feel worthless and etc etc.\n\nFlash forward to now. I still don't have a super healthy relationship with food and also have days where I binge but it's been getting a lot better. On Monday I found out my (ex)boyfriend cheated on me and I completely suck into a depression. I haven't really eaten much since Monday night and I can feel my mindset changing back to my unhealthy habits. I've worked out everyday since Monday even though I haven't eaten anything and at the end of the day I'm proud of myself for not eating and for working out. My mind will start telling me like \"wow, you've only eaten like 200 calories today but you just ran 2 miles...that's amazing...imagine how much weight you'll lose if you keep this up\" and stuff like that...like the devil on my shoulder that kept praising my unhealthy habits is back and I don't know how to shake it. I ran 2 miles today but all I've eaten all day is a salad with some tuna. I have a peach cobbler my mom made me in my fridge and I was like, \"oh I could eat some of that\" but I literally just can't let myself eat it....even though if I ate legit the entire thing I STILL wouldn't go over my calories.

This summer I worked out everyday and by the end of it my family and friends were commenting on my \u2018six pack\u2019 and that I had lost a lot of weight and was I okay - I still think I looked really overweight. \n\nNow I\u2019m at uni and I felt so bloated after my first exam - I didn\u2019t eat so much, but I couldn\u2019t really exercise besides walking to campus, and ate biscuits (which I didn\u2019t do before). \n\nI started eating cleaner, they fixed our fridge in halls so I cooked lots of healthy meals and went to the gym for the first time in five or six weeks. I did half of my normal routine. I felt great at the gym but came home and had blurry vision, and then difficulty speaking. My parents looked after me and I was better towards the end of the night. My blood pressure was measured and it seemed normal. \n\nMy parents had a friend over for a takeaway that same night, and I relented and took part in the curry meal (I was very hungry and hadn\u2019t really eaten yet). This morning I got up to have the rest of the meal and found that the naan bread was gone - one of my parents had accidentally thrown it away while clearing up. I usually clear up but they told me to sit back down because of earlier that evening. \n\nI felt so upset over this naan bread, not because of my parent because it was an easy mistake to make, but because it feels like a sign that I shouldn\u2019t have been eating it in the first place, that I also shouldn\u2019t have been having any of the rice or veggies or chicken. I had a benecol instead.\n\nI really just want to sit down and enjoy food but I\u2019m always conscious of how much it \u2018costs\u2019. I\u2019ll sometimes fantasise about how good a meal is going to taste and then be upset by how I managed to eat it all, or by how quickly I\u2019ve eaten it (sometimes relatively slow to others) and that I should have been more responsible and spread it out so I could enjoy it more. \n\nCan anybody give me some insight into what\u2019s going on? If it\u2019s any help I tend to get these symptoms at this time of year, and they disappear when it gets hotter again.

I think I\u2019m more or less \u201chealthy\u201d but thats mostly because I have a good metabolism and occasionally getting super stressed out allows me to lose weight. I feel so hopeless about dieting because my whole thing is that I don\u2019t have control over my relationship with food. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to use food to control the shape of my body when I can\u2019t even just control the food. Someday my metabolism is going to slow down even more and I will be unhealthy. I\u2019ve spent like over 300$ more than what I actually have in reality this much and that excess is pretty much entirely just on food because whenever I get really sad I go and I eat a fuckton of food. I\u2019m scared for Thanksgiving and I\u2019m scared because I am spending money at a really terrible rate on food. I\u2019m scared for my health. I admit that I sometimes eat my suitemates food. I try to not but I definitely pinch stuff from their leftovers here and there. Just now I saw a note on the fridge saying more or less \u201cDon\u2019t eat other people\u2019s food\u2014that\u2019s not nice. We notice.\u201d I noticed this RIGHT after i ate some of my suitemates chicken and now I feel terrible. I know I shouldn\u2019t have done that and I feel like my food habits are even making me a bad person now. How is this supposed to end?", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

{"post_id": "e1kfg4", "created_utc": 1574707136, "title": "Diagnosed last week in inpatient", "author": "Renneth", "self_text": "Just got diagnosed with an eating disorder last week as I was being discharged from a psychiatric hospital (voluntary commitment, suicidal) and still kind of processing it. Apologies for the rambling mess that's about to follow. On the one hand: duh, I'm underweight and still trying to lose because my weight is \"the one thing I have complete control over\". I told the inpatient psychiatrist that if my life were a board game represented by 100 tokens, I only held three of those tokens, and two of them were my weight loss.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm really mortified to be diagnosed with an \"attention-seeking\" disorder. My fiance was really angry with me when I reached out to him about it roughly a week before being hospitalized. I expected him to say something like: \"Wow, that's a lot to take in. It sounds like you're going through a lot and this is definitely concerning. I appreciate you reaching out to me and I'm here for you regardless.\" Instead: \"Why the fuck would you be trying to lose weight if you weigh X?\" and \"You *know* better than this\" and \"Well, you'd better fucking talk to your therapist about this.\" He came around later that day and apologized, but it still contributed to me feeling out-of-control and isolated.\n\nAlso, EDNOS feels just... not as satisfying? Part of my feels really bad about not having lost enough weight to qualify for anorexia, which is dumb. Even if I were that underweight, I still think I would've been diagnosed with EDNOS, as I don't think I have body dysmorphia -- I think I objectively look thin but not concerningly so (i.e. slightly underweight). And while I don't have a ton of body positivity, I have more or less the exact same vague dissatisfaction with my body I had when I was thirty pounds heavier and everything in between. This worried me, because while I don't think my GW is only a little unhealthy, I know I won't be satisfied once I get there because it's the *process* of losing weight that's fueling me, and I'm worried I'll try to drop into dangerously low territory.\n\nThere was another girl in our ward who was in recovery with an eating disorder, and somehow we recognized each other?? I don't understand it, because we were both eating everything they gave us in an attempt to be released sooner. I think she flagged me because I drank my coffee black (definitely an ED control thing: \"fine, I'll eat your food, but you can't make me put creamer in my coffee\"). I flagged her because I caught her watching me eat out of the corner of my eye my first meal there, and also she asked me what I thought about her jeans in a weird way. Anyway, I feel bad for not being able to open up at the time, and she has all my best wishes for her continued recovery.\n\nOkay, last few rants. The place was severely understaffed, and some of the mental health technicians were very unprofessional -- I was told multiple times something to the effect of \"I don't see what a pretty girl like you has to be depressed about\", which is horrifying, because I imagine they're given ten or so stock phrases to say to people with different diagnoses/situations, and that statement should never, ever be in their short list. A nurse also called us inmates at one point. Also, a male patient told me I look like \"the kind of girl who takes care of herself\", i.e. diets &amp; exercises / is thin, which was kind of triggering but more forgivable. I got hit on a lot by male patients in general, who always assumed I was a teenager. The staff kept telling me every day that I was going to be transferred to a young adult ward in the children's hospital across the street (I guess because of my baby face, or else to put me near more college-educated folks), but they never did. Finally, my discharge papers were marked with \"academic/educational difficulties\", which is baffling, because I graduated with my bachelors several years ago and am not currently applying to grad school or anything -- but sure, what the hell, let's add that to my list of failures too.\n\ntl;dr coming to terms with the fact that I have an ED; also inpatient is a great place for a crisis but it kind of sucks overall", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Always telling me I was eating too much (I was a chubby kid, but active) and I needed to diet or I was going to end up like my obese aunt. So by the time I\u2019d gotten to high school I\u2019d developed pretty severe depression (more to it than just this but that\u2019s another story) and started restricting myself from eating, exercising on the treadmill instead of going to the cafeteria for lunch, skipping meals with friends, and constantly keeping my daily calorie count below a certain number. I\u2019ve never seen a therapist or ever really talked to anyone about it, but after graduating I\u2019d been eating more (no more calorie counting, but I\u2019m still very aware of how much calories I\u2019m consuming) and in the past two and a half years I\u2019ve put on more weight and I\u2019ve been obsessed with how I look. And the days when the depression is at its worst are the days I don\u2019t eat, but all I do is think about food.\n\nIf I\u2019m not eating, I\u2019m thinking about eating or making food, all I want to do is eat.

It was still helping with overall mood and energy, but I went back to my doc and had her prescribe me Vyvanse, which I had used in the past for ADHD, to change things up.  After a week on Vyvanse I'm finding that taking my dose early AM, around 4PM or so I start to get tired, somewhat irritable, and my focus lapses.  I'm usually dead tired by 8:30PM or so, which normally I would've stayed up and continued to do things, productive, or not, until at least 10-11PM.  \n\nConsidering I have a lot of Adipex left over, and in 15mg increments, not the 37.5 dose, could I use them both from a combination approach to help in getting through the mid-afternoon slump I have.  Say, Vyvanse 40mg upon waking, and then dose Adipex 15mg mid afternoon around 1-2PM?  Truth be told, 99% of the eating issues I have are post-dinner time decisions made on the couch.  I could use some later day effectiveness (as long as it does not interfere with sleep severely).  Just wondering if this approach is something I could attempt, I know I would be combining 2 stimulants.

I feel trapped in my body. I\u2019ve been overweight since I was a kid and feel like it\u2019s impacted every little faucet of my life and has gotten to the point where I look back on the past and feel it\u2019s been ruined by my weight. I can\u2019t remember what should be happy memories as just memories, just think of the weigh and how gross I felt while doing everything. \n\nPetting a baby tiger? My arms looked gross and I thought way too much about it both in the moment and also when I look at pictures. Going to Japan? Let\u2019s remember how I went shopping and only ended up with accessories cause all the cute things I wanted didn\u2019t fit. Not even in a size way, in a \u201cdoesn\u2019t suit me\u201d way. How about going to the beach and just feeling constant shame when I looked down and saw my belly protruding? I could keep going but my point isn\u2019t flagellation here. \n\nSo when I tell people, \u201cOh, I just want to feel better about myself and like I\u2019m at a normal weight so I can enjoy and savor life without these feelings\u201d they tell me not to wait until I am that way to enjoy life and like... I do try to enjoy myself, but I feel a lot of pressure to get to a place where I\u2019m actually happy with myself so upcoming events aren\u2019t just another disgusting memories. I think about how I have a trip next summer, again to Japan. I can get pretty close to my goal by then, even without disordered eating. Why wouldn\u2019t I want that? Why is trying for that (still healthy) goal so bad, when it will work much better than some weird attempt at body positivity? \n\nThe worst is when they tell me I should work on accepting myself as I am now. I literally just can\u2019t??? And then they tell me \u201cOh, you\u2019ll never be satisfied so you should stop thinking things will change\u201d. But when I was so close to a healthy weight, once about 4 years ago, I finally felt like I had it. I look at pictures from that time and feel good. My memories are rosier and I even felt okay with eating such tasty food in moderation. I liked seeing friends, I went clothes shopping and was relatively happy with the results. I wanted pictures of myself, wanted to go out, felt that pure joy because I finally felt like I had begun to leave the cage that was my body. And I hadn\u2019t even reached a healthy BMI yet- imagine how I\u2019d feel when I finally touched down smackdown in the middle of the healthy range! \n\n\nI\u2019m upset that my therapists (both group and one-on-one) keep telling me to accept the weight I\u2019m at, stop trying to change it, stop trying to control my diet. I feel like they want me to settle even though I know I could make myself happy.

Yesterday I nearly broke down because my dietitian  told me she wanted me to \"at least get back *up* to the weight [I] was when [I]  initially started treatment.\" I cried when I heard that. I am obese, obesity is not healthy or natural-- people in colonial times didn't struggle with obesity like our society does today. This is not normal.

I would rather die than live in this fat body. I hate it, society hates it, we all hate my body. And I don't believe society is wrong for being fat-phobic-- I think heavier people deserve to be treated with the same respect as thin people, but weight loss is sometimes valid and important for health reasons, and not being attracted to fat people is not inherently wrong. Some people prefer brunettes, others like people that can fit into size 6 jeans.  \n\nI hate that I feel so powerless over my own body here in treatment. I have this fantasy in my head that they'll tell me I'm cured and send me home, where I can go back to eating just 1-2 days/week.

That being said, I've been pretty good about fighting my all-or-nothing attitude towards food, and I think that Thanksgiving is going to be a test for me in that regard, and likely for many others. If you can relate, then here is a much needed reminder:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn what universe is overeating by 5000 calories the same as overeating 500 calories? This is a basic pre-algebra inequality people and don't you forget it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, not even joking though. Yesterday I wanted a burger. So I got in line to get a burger. Then I started feeling super guilty and thinking stuff like \"well, I'm already getting a burger, might as well get fries and a shake as well\" like ????  I've identified this thought pattern and have started to think it through more logically.  First I asked myself, \"do I really want fries and a milkshake? Is that why I came here?\" No, I came here because I was craving a burger. Then I talk myself through it like a teacher would to a 4th grader. \"Okay, so you only want the burger. Yes, a burger is a lot of calories. Yes, a burger isn't the healthiest option. But just because those statements are both true doesn't mean that we should get a fries and milkshake also. A burger is about 550 calories. Fries would be another 400. A milkshake would be another 600. Since when is 1550 calories the same as 550 calories? Exactly, it's not.\" Not even joking, this type of thinking, despite how rudimentary it seems, has helped me soooo much with not bingeing. It can seem simplistic, since all this information is just basic logic, but with BED, my brain doesn't think about food logically, so I need to remind myself that food exists on a spectrum and not in black and white. Overeating by 300 calories is not the same as overeating by 3000.\n\nI've been trying to repeat this line of thinking every time I catch myself in the \"oh crap, I already messed up might as well do whatever I want\" mindset. I know this advice isn't really helpful for emotional triggers, but as for the all-or-nothing mindset, it's been helping me a ton lately so I've decided to share it in case it helps anyone else. I have a very mathematical brain so thinking about food in a more objective and calculated manner has been helping a lot.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

When I occasionally check their private vent account where we follow each other, I'm left mortified. I'm so worried about them and, well, I can't lie to myself anymore about the fact that they're impacting me negatively. But this isn't about me. I really don't want to cut them off or end this friendship. I don't want to abandon them.\n\nSo please, please give me some advice on how to at least try to convince them to get some help. They're *very* stubborn about not getting any. They're also very educated about their problem and they know they have a problem but they still don't want help.

Maybe even link me to some resources that might answer these questions if you can't give me advice yourself.

I'm not going to my family's (or anyones) thanksgiving because I couldnt afford to drive out and I have too much homework for finals. I've decided to fast today. And the next 2 days i will eat as little as possible because I know my boyfriend will bring up my eating habits on saturday if I dont eat. I just want to feel beautiful when he takes pictures of me. I dont feel beautiful when he touches me anymore. I wear hoodies in bed with him. I dont even want to be naked around him ever. \n\nI'm so sick of looking in the mirror, feeling disgusting, taking up so much space. I miss feeling beautiful and proud of myself and my body. If I cant work out and buy the food I want, I'm just stopping. It will save money too and I can use that to buy the food I want.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I think this is due in part to the wildly irrational feeling of being fat for eating all of something. This applies to literally any food - I could maintain some feeling of control if I stopped halfway through a bowl of rice but I'd instantly feel obese if I ate an entire bowl of salad, even if it was less calories. I guess I just feel guilty and ashamed when I see an empty plate in front of me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, I think the other half of my last bite anxiety is due to the dread of finishing my food and having to endure hunger again until whenever I next allow myself to eat. It's almost as if eating anything at all is a waste if that last bite isn't perfect. This, coincidentally, also makes me feel fat. How dare I enjoy and savor my food, right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe worst part of all of this is that I recognize the absurdly paradoxical and irrational nature of my thoughts but still can't stop panicking every time I'm about to take the last bite of whatever it is I'm eating. I guess I'll just have to invent food that you can taste and chew forever like chewing gum - now that's the future right there!", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

And it Will make you less likely to binge, as they aren't as addictive as the artificial, non organic stuff. \n2. Have full meals that have enough fiber, that consist of some proteins and some kinda of vegetables. This will actually help with the desire to binge since it makes you feel full for longer so your day can go by without you binging as much. \n3. All this along with drinking some more water.\n\nI'm thinking too much about food now. I gotta go to sleep. Good night sweet people", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I made this throwaway For specifically this sub as well as r/stopdrinking because some people in my life know my main, and I\u2019m deciding to get my shit together, with some support from my friends here on Reddit. I\u2019ve been lurking here a while, and I\u2019m really impressed with the support I\u2019ve seen.\n\nA bit about me: I\u2019m 27f, and I never had an issue with food (or booze) until I was 21. I grew up in an active family, and we ate healthy meals, but I also never obsessed about that I was eating. I played sports and was in good shape. My freshman year of college was also fine, and the following summer, I decided to start running a bit more, to drop the approximately 5-7 lbs I\u2019d put on after adding alcohol to my diet over the year. \n\nI spiraled into full on anorexia and by that winter I was so underweight I had to be hospitalized. It was a wake up call, and I gained weight back steadily over the next couple of years. When I graduated college I was in incredible shape. However, after my struggle with anorexia, I struggled with reactive/binge eating. I\u2019ve been out of school a few years now, and for a long time I was doing well... then this past summer my entire world was rocked by a breakup with the man I thought I was going to marry. I won\u2019t get into the details, but he absolutely wrecked me. My confidence and trust in people is shattered. I had to completely change almost everything about my life overnight. My depression came back in full swing, and I don\u2019t have access to medication. Some days I can hardly get out of bed. \n\nI started drinking way more than I should. Often drinking 1, 1.5, or even 2 bottles of wine a night. And as soon as I get drunk, I want to binge. I wake up feeling bloated and gross and hating myself. I\u2019m wasting money and time and hurting myself emotionally and this is so bad for my body. \n\n\nI have stayed active, and I appear fit and happy to most people around me, but I\u2019m about 15lbs heavier than where I feel confident. My family knows I\u2019m struggling and they have been supportive. I\u2019m very grateful to them. I\u2019m getting my drinking under control, and hopefully the binging will follow. Sorry this got so long... I wanted to introduce myself and get that off my chest.  \n\nGoing into thanksgiving weekend with hope.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

If you drink a lot of tea so that the caffeine staves off your appetite, you've probably had a few instances where you felt *awful* after drinking it. Like, super uncomfortably nauseous, almost like you've got a stomach bug. This happened to me this morning, and I felt like death, so I looked into what caused it.\n\nIt turns out tea has this thing called tannins in it (as do coffee, wine, and chocolate). White, black, green, and oolong teas all have tannins, due to all coming from the leaves of the \"Canmellia Sinensis\" plant. Black tea is generally considered to have the highest concentration of tannins, and green tea is considered to have the lowest. This obviously varies between different subtypes of those teas, how a given tea is produces, etc. Tannins do some good thins, like providing antioxidants and, in the case of green tea, providing a tannin called \"epigallocatechin gallate\" (EGCG), which research is showing can reduce inflammation and protect against cellular damage and *debatably* some cancers (the research into the potential effects EGCG might have on cancer is *very* new, and is still ongoing, so this isn't *proven* so much as some recent studies have shown a correlation between lowered rates of breast cancer {by 20%} and colorectal cancer {18%}).\n\nSo, tannins seem pretty rad, right? They can (kinda) help your health, and they give teas a wide range of flavors, from the high concentrations in black teas contributing to bitterness, and the lower concentrations in green teas making them taste lighter. Welllllll, a side effect of tannins is that they can make your mouth feel dry and make you feel *real* sick, especially if you're drinking the tea on an empty stomach, which, I mean, is a pretty common occurrence for a lot of us here.\n\nWhat can help with the nausea?  \n\\- Steeping your tea for less time. The longer your tea steeps, the more tannins are released, which means the more nauseous you'll feel. Consider steeping your tea for, say, three minutes instead of 5.  \n\\- Cut it with your milk of choice. I know adding calories may be tough for a lot of us, but if you're getting nauseous often after drinking tea, it can really help. [Dairy] milk binds to the tannin, which makes it a lot less nausea-inducing.  \n\\- If you've already drank the tea and you feel nauseous, down some starches! Rice Cakes, a slice or two of bread, some corn tortillas - anything like that will work.  \n\\- Eat or drink some ginger. Chewing a piece of ginger right off of the root (without swallowing it) can help w nausea.  \n\\- Mix a half a teaspoon of baking soda into a cup of water and drink that.\n\nHope this helps! Now go drink some tea ya beautiful bish. You deserve it.\n\n\u2800\n\n^^[Sources](https://pastebin.com/jrsY7102)", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I mentioned in my title that I was \"finally\" getting help, but I have been trying for over a year and a half to find someone qualified who takes my insurance.\n\nExcuse my rant, but has anyone else had to deal with a ridiculous amount of setbacks and obstacles in finding a therapist?\n\nMy first therapist was a graduate student at a local university. She was amazing, supportive, and so sweet, but my sickness was way out of her league. This was at the time when I was at my worse and severely undernourished, overexercising, and binging/purging up to 5 times a day. I could tell she really tried, but I was wasting both of our time.\n\nI then contacted my GP and asked for referrals to therapists who specialized in EDs. I was teamed up with a social worker at the office and had to play phone tag for a week. The day that I did finally get in touch with her. She gave me two referrals. One did not specialize in EDs. Both were out of network. Ok...\n\nI went on various ED association websites to find lists of therapists or group meetings. I even thought about going to Overeaters Anonymous until I read a few posts/reviews about how the environment tends to be competitive and could trigger progressively worse behaviors. \n\nI worked with my next therapist for about two months before she took maternity leave.\n\nI then went on Psychology Today and found a therapist who specialized in women's and weight issues. Spoke to her on the phone; seemed to click well. She said she took my insurance! Finally! I went to her for two sessions before she told me she was going on vacation for a few weeks and would contact me when she got back. She never called me back. I then found out she was not, in fact, under my insurance. I had gotten charged $160 each session.\n\nI turned to Psychology Today again and contacted as many therapists within a 30-minute drive who took my insurance. Despite what it said on the website, NONE of these therapists took my insurance.\n\nNext, turned to NEDA and spoke to someone about compiling me a referral list. I asked for ED specialists living within half an hour from me and who took my insurance. The few names I got were all under my insurance, but over an hour drive from me.\n\nI really hope this therapist works out.\n\nTLDR: It's been exhausting to find a therapist. I was this close to giving up.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

It was first a way of showing my loved ones that I was normal, that I wasn't starving myself. It's become a habit, but also a coping mechanism. I work 12 hour shifts without any food, just teas and coffees. On my days off, I only eat dinner with my boyfriend. My eating disorder evolved from restricting and binging in complete secrecy, to overeating in front of others. I think past me would be pretty disgusted.\n\nBut I don't mind this. I don't always binge when I eat (but I do binge a lot, and it's showing even with medication that boosts my metabolism). I can learn how to eat normal portions. But how do I re-learn to eat when I'm alone?", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I've gained 23 lbs in the last two months which means I'm very close to being obese (for my height) . So I decided I should try to lose some weight. I posted a sheet of paper on a noticeboard in my room with my weight which track everyday. My boyfriend also wanted to do it with me so his weight is on there as well. Yesterday we had a mutual friend come over and I told my boyfriend that maybe we should take the sheet down. He said that I was just being paranoid and \"no one will know they're just random numbers on a sheet\". The thing is there's literally a column labelled 'calories' so its pretty obvious but I didn't push. The friend came and he stayed in the living room area so all was good. Today we had another friend come in and the sheet completely slipped my mind. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs soon as she sat down she asked if we were on a diet and was going through the sheet. This is someone I haven't seen since I gained the weight (not just the last 20 lbs but the 40lbs total I've gained since May). So I was already pretty hesitant about meeting her and hoped that weight wouldn't come up. As soon as she said it though I died a little inside. I know it's stupid but I can't handle someone knowing exactly how much I weigh. I used to be really thin before, everyone commented on my figure, my looks. But now I'm just this fat lump who's too afraid to leave her house because she doesn't want anybody to see her like this. So I ordered some McDonalds and ate bunch. I do not understand why I did it exactly. I just felt like \"well its all shit anyway, everyone knows now so it doesn't really matter\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm just so sick of this. All I think about is food and how fat I look. In high school it was restrictive eating and I was quite underweight, after that stopped it turned into binge eating and basically not having the strength to think about anything other than food. I'm just so tired of all of this. This has been going on for almost 10 years now and I'm just done. Like fuck all this shit.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I\u2019ve been a bit obsessed with corn&amp;rice cakes since my last relapse, so I\u2019ve been living off them almost entirely. I usually have them with Soya yoghurt, frozen microwaved berries and maybe a banana. I ate my 4 corn cakes with toppings, but ran out of Soya yoghurt so I only had fruit on it. Because I barely had any protein/fat in the meal after basically fasting all day my sugar spiked and went down which made my anxiety even worse... \n\nSo I remembered I had some butternut squash in the fridge, microwaved it and had the portion with 4 more corn cakes. I don\u2019t remember the last time I felt this relaxed, it\u2019s like I had a glass of wine/just binged but no guilt - after that meal 2 hours after my dinner. My calories are still kind of acceptable (740) and I don\u2019t feel the need to binge at all. \n\nI count it as a small victory, but am also curious how did a small meal like that calm me down? I eat both of those things regularly, and neither is high in fat (which can be numbing for anxiety). The only reasonable explanation I can come up with is electrolytes, because I haven\u2019t had ANY (literally 0) salt or natural sodium since Sunday. \n\nIf anyone has ideas feel free to comment, but other than that I am just happy I can share my little victory here! \n(Oh and my thoughts go to everyone celebrating thanksgiving today!)", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

But I don't think I should be running now, given that I definitely was starting to build uncomfortably strong links between distance ran, calories burned, and how much I'd allow myself to eat.\n\nStill, having something to work at and feeling strong and in control of my body is something I did feel good about doing. Gaining weight and (maybe) muscle in the process of moving better seems like it might be a better aim to have as well, and kind of like shifting the focus from physical to mental wellbeing. \n\nSo what I was considering is maybe for this month at least, shelving the running and looking at going towards some slow yoga and pull ups, to just get more in tune with myself physically and focus more on movement and control and maintaining a base level of ability than on heart rate and reps done and calories burned. \n\nI've also been trying to resist the internal voice telling me that this is wasting all the work I've done over the last year, and that it's taking a lazy way out, and I should be choosing a HIIT or 'real' strength training program, and don't I know that 30 mins of activity is recommended daily (for, uh, most people, not those recovering from disordered eating habits), etc.\n\nAnyway, I was wondering if anyone else reading this has tried something similar and how it might have gone for you! Or if anyone has any advice or help on whether what I'm thinking about is worth giving a shot. Definitely would appreciate any and all replies or thoughts on it. :D", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

In fact, I think I was malnourished to begin with and likely have been my whole life, making this whole fucked up situation worse. But I restricted to 1200-1300/day, and with my starting weight and maintenance calories that meant I definitely lost a fair bit of muscle mass, along with a lot of body fat (that might I add was healthy to lose to start with). I had been consistently sticking to that number for over a year (would restrict more when necessary to make up for binges) until when I wanted to start exercising, and so ate back the exercise calories and since then my hunger level's been gradually increasing and I've still been binging. Well since starting strength training I've been reflecting and realising that I was ignoring A LOT of signs that my body was shutting down in the past year and a half, especially in the peak of my restriction when I would try and get down to 1000/1100 net a day. I read online about the symptoms of underfeeding, and amenorrhea is a very common one, but because I still had my period all throughout this time I genuinely thought I was eating enough and ignored everything else. These symptoms were happening when I was at the bottom of the \"overweight\" BMI range, making me think I couldn't possibly have anything wrong with me, that it's normal to feel like this, I made up so many excuses to justify my behaviour man.\n\nSo even though I was more than a \"healthy\" weight, and I was eating \"healthy\" foods and avoiding ALL \"processed\" foods (apart from the times I would binge horribly, out of the house), *I WAS NOT HEALTHY*. And sometimes I forget just how sick I was. It's likely I need to delve straight into recovery to let my body heal its insides and build muscle and repair nerve tissue and stuff, cos my brain likes to trick me into thinking nah I didn't do any damage, I'm still functioning and I'm not underweight so it can't be that bad.\n\nThese are just some off the top of my head:\n\n- massive blood sugar crashes when eating the slightest bit of processed sugar or big carby meals\n- falling asleep unexpectedly while watching videos/listening to music/even doing uni work\n- taking 3 or 4 hr naps in the middle of the day to get through rhe rest of the day\n- constantly getting pins and needles in my legs from sitting in bed so much\n- or if I was sitting in an unusual way\n- losing feeling in my toes even with two layers of socks on\n- fingers and toes became paler than the rest of my hand/foot when they would lose feeling and wouldn't go back to normal for a good while\n- constantly cold indoors even with 3 layers on and in bed\n- time period between menstrual cycles gradually got longer and longer (even tho yeah I still had them each \"month\")\n- after my ab*rtion (yes, I was still somehow fertile, it's a miracle my body didn't sacrifice that) I bled for about a month and a half vs. what would normally be 7-14 days\n- would get dizzy / white spots in vision when I would get up from a seated floor position\n- extremely constipated, went once to twice a week\n- kitchen was so bare of processed food that I binged on chocolate chips, mini marshmallows and spoonfuls of pure sugar\n- had extreme mood swings, constantly irritated, spiteful and jealous of others\n\nSo if you're reading this and think you're fine bc you still have your period and/or you're a \"healthy weight\", your body's probably just showing damage in other ways. I just wish I had paid attention at the time because being able to  read all of that makes me fear what damage I've actually done to my body.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

My weight's been fluctuating a lot since I went away to school three semesters ago. I wasn't overweight before, but I had put on a few pounds in my later high school years. I didn't mind the weight necessarily until it started coming off in my first year of college (unintentionally) and I liked that. I didn't eat as large portions at university, and I had more control over my dietary decisions.\nThis year though, I've been much more consciously trying to lose weight. My friends and I started going to the gym, and I saw an opportunity to get the body I've always wanted (flat tummy and a thigh gap). I started counting every calorie (about 1000 a day), and working out super hard to burn as much as I could off. I didn't think anything was wrong with it, and I was very pleased with the fast results. A couple of my friends started to worry, and that's when I started to wonder...\nAm I on the verge of an eating disorder?\nRecently, anytime I'm coming back from a meal regretting either how much I ate or the food I ate, or just getting anxiety about gaining it back in general, I get this really powerful urge to throw up (note: I've never made myself throw up before).\nIt's starting to worry me, especially now that I'm home for Thanksgiving and wanting to fall back into my old eating habits and eat random snacks (which I'm starting to wonder if it might be a binging urge), but not knowing if I should or not because I'm so scared to gain weight and lose progress.\nI'm sorry that this was long, I'm curious and nervous.

I was thinking about it today how, even if I was in a more \"recovered\" place and not necessarily participating in my eating disorder behaviours, I have thought about food and felt guilt from eating with literally every meal for the last 10+ years. Even if I was in a good space mentally and physically I don't think I've ever just eaten a meal without thinking \"I could purge this if I really needed to,\" \"I'm eating too much,\" \"People must be judging what I'm eating,\" \"thank god I'm eating in private.\" Every. Single. Meal.\n\nI also caught on to a newer behaviour this week... I've been very overwhelmed with a new job and my anxiety has been very difficult to deal with. I also suffer from OCD and compulsively check things (if the door is locked, if the light is off, if the stove is off - which is funny, because I could literally not cook a meal for a week and I \\*still\\* need to check the stove multiple times a day). Anyway, I've been struggling with a bit of a relapse (or a total relapse, IDK, eating disorders are hard), and I made a rule that I'm not allowed to eat until I am caught up at work. I am aware this is dumb and not healthy, but it gives me something to do to focus and cope. I am allowing myself to drink coffee throughout the day, but I find myself worrying that I've accidentally eaten something. My office has a lot of communal snacks and the when I got home I could not stop thinking about my day to make sure I didn't accidentally eat something (even though I know I didn't). \n\nDoes anyone else relate?

For the first time in years, I had a thanksgiving where I ate everything I wanted and didn't feel guilty about it. There was one low point where I took a picture and thought I looked huge (and for a brief moment felt incredibly stressed about eating because my impulse was to start restricting) but then I realized how unflattering my top actually was and how changing would totally solve that problem. I managed to get some pretty cute pictures afterwards. Anyways, thanksgiving is kinda rough for me because not only do we have the regular feast and desserts, but my friends and I have a tradition of getting together after thanksgiving, going to target and buying a ton of snacks, and then going home to eat them and watch a movie before going black friday shopping the next day. I was kinda nervous about this in the days leading up but today I felt totally fine. I didn't feel stressed while were looking at all the candy and chips and just picked something I liked and didn't even end up eating all of it. It's been a good day in my book. I feel like I'm making progress but I admit letting go of restriction is sooooo hard sometimes. It seems that many people with BED have the same issues with restriction as anorexics, we're just bad at it. Of course I acknowledge that BED can also result from emotional coping mechanisms and psychological trauma (which is a partial contributer in my case- I'm not good at coping with anxiety at all which sucks because I get anxious pretty dang easily)). My family is hosting another party on Saturday so I'm basically going to be presented with the same situation as today but if I go in with caution I think I will be okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said, I can't get carried away with celebrating my progress. I'm still by no means cured from BED and in the past, this celebratory attitude is what has often caused me to let my guard down, stop monitoring my emotions/behavior, and then binge again.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I\u2019m 25 and have been dealing with disordered eating habits for ~19 years. I started trying to recover when I graduated high school. There have been ups and downs.. basically I have a good year, here, a bad year there. I got married last year, 2018 was a good year for me. I got to a healthy weight and was eating vegan, but not restricting calories or exercising excessively (I use to binge/restrict and purge through exercise a lot). Shortly after my wedding I got pregnant. I let go of the reigns on being vegan. I was pregnant and having odd cravings and food aversions, I allowed myself to eat what I wanted when I wanted. I gained 70 lbs while I was pregnant. I lost 30 of that after I gave birth. I am only a month postpartum, so I am not allowed to exercise more than short walks, and I haven\u2019t changed my dietary habits back to healthier ones yet. I\u2019m anxious about not eating enough and tanking my milk supply, so I end up over eating. \n\nI feel awful about my body. I know I just brought a human being into the world, but I feel like the year of eating well and exercising was a waste and I\u2019m back at square one (except now I\u2019m covered in more stretch marks). I feel completely out of control of my body, so I end up disassociating and binging on a near daily basis. I know the other swing of the pendulum for me is usually restricting and purging. I\u2019m hoping I can be strong and find my healthy rhythm once I\u2019m cleared for exercise again, but I can feel the struggle already. \n\nWhen I look at myself I feel overwhelmed with regret. I miss my body. The regret is followed by a sting of guilt,  as my body had to be sacrificed to being my sweet baby into the world. A choice I would make again, I just wish it came without the consequence. \n\nIdk if anyone has any advice on how to get past this, but I really just needed to vent.

I still lose on it and am at a 16.8 BMI now. I have extreme hunger basically all day everyday because of my daily steps on campus and going to the gym 4-5x a week. I just don\u2019t know if that\u2019s even anorexia. Or bulimia because some days I will eat a box of cereal or whatever I\u2019m craving and restrict the rest of the day, even though my cals are still around 1200. I also nibble on food a lot and never really have one meal. When I come home I usually eat a 350 ish meal, then a string cheese, popcorn, rice cakes, maybe a PB mug cake, celery, etc... I literally will eat for like 2 hours. \n\nSo yeah wtf should I even call this? Or what category does it fall under?", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Going to therapy and having someone help you make a plan to recovery is so important, and while I understand its harder to get with some, I always try to make a point of how important it is to have one. You\u2019ve all heard it before, and with people who suffer with BED and oh lord, it\u2019s like home to us, and that is ALL OR NOTHING THINKING. To me, all or nothing thinking isn\u2019t simple as just never being satisfied or having trouble being easy on yourself, as much as it is a way to knock yourself down. As I continue to struggle with that asshat named ED, I\u2019ve tried taking my therapists advice of really paying attention to those feelings I have when I want to binge, and understanding what is going through my mind. What I\u2019ve really realized is that for me at least, I want to do better and go improve myself in one way or another every day yet I find myself asking the classic question, \u201cwhat\u2019s the point?\u201d Getting into the habit of asking yourself that and letting it dictate your daily decisions can absolutely ruin your mental state and I\u2019ve very much picked up on it for myself. When I want do better, when I don\u2019t want to binge and do what I KNOW is right, that damn question always pops up into my head. And as sad as it is to admit it I\u2019ve really been letting it win lately. \u201cYou can just start over tomorrow\u201d \u201cCome on let\u2019s just unwind for tonight, you\u2019ve earned it\u201d and plenty more are the usual thoughts that pop up in my head during my craving hours and they can be absolutely horrible to deal with. As hard as it may be to ignore and deny those thoughts, and as hard as it is to go against what you want to do in the moment you have to stop yourself from overthinking and thinking in such a black and white way. For me it becomes that black and white thinking because I look at the whole picture at once when I want to binge. \u201cI want to stop binge eating\u201d \u201cI want to lose that weight\u201d \u201cI need to start working out\u201d you start to think of all of these things until eventually it overwhelms you and then.....snap. You\u2019ve convinced yourself its not worth it, that one night won\u2019t hurt you and that its just far too much effort to really make that change. Like myself you can convince yourself that you will \u201cstart over tomorrow\u201d until eventually you realize..damn, I\u2019ve been saying \u201ctomorrow\u201d for a year now..As depressing as some of that is to hear for myself it\u2019s the cold harsh reality and I\u2019m calling myself out on it. What I want to make a point of to you guys, is that every day DOES matter, and the small stuff DOES add up, but especially the good things! No, not binge eating one night doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to wake up ripped and a new person. BUT, you will wake up feeling lighter, less foggy, more energized and you will realize you made a small, but important step in the right direction. You decide to take things one day at a time and ask yourselves, \u201cwhat did I do today that helped myself become a better me?\u201d And you will be shocked where you end up. I\u2019ve called myself out on this and I want to share my experiences with you guys in hopes I help you in someway. Thinking in black and white is so common in people suffering from BED and there\u2019s obvious reasons behind it. It\u2019s so easy to let negativity overcome us and to let that normal way of life win, but we ALL know we\u2019re better than that. I\u2019m starting to tell myself I\u2019m better than that and I want all of us to do the same, because why? Because WE\u2019RE WORTH THE EFFORT! Be kind to yourselves, thinking more positively on a smaller scale every day helps us get closer to the version of ourselves we want to be. Don\u2019t let ED come in and ruin your day like he\u2019s ruined mine for 5 years. I really have started to see and understand this pattern of thinking with myself, and I\u2019m sure some of you may do the same thing but may not even realize it. Remember you\u2019re all worth that effort, and strive to be as positive as you can everyday, we got this!!", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I am here because I am so incredibly sick of being underweight. My mind and body are crippled as a result of my weight and eating restrictions. My hair is falling out and there are now bald spots on my head. Women have made it clear that they do not find my body at all attractive in its current state, and my girlfriend of almost four years left me earlier this year and cited all of this as a reason. I am tired of feeling horrible about myself and experiencing anxiety/depression every day. \n\nI believe that my experience with anorexia and restricting has been quite atypical; I restrict to support an addiction to Kratom. I have been using this substance for more than five years, and in that time I have gone from ~135lb to less than 117lb. I have always been a very skinny person with a small appetite, but since my kratom use became a full-fledged daily addiction I have become extremely thin and unhealthy.\n\nThe main reason I have lost so much weight is because kratom only works for me and gets me \"high\" on an empty stomach. I have to wait at least three hours after eating to take a dose, and since I take three doses of kratom every day, I never give myself the time or amount needed for proper sustenance. In addition to this, kratom also seriously diminishes my appetite, either through nausea or just because of the main effects of being high. I feel like a rat in a laboratory study who chooses to consume cocaine or heroin over food and sex.\n\nI am ready to quit my addiction to kratom and start eating like a normal human being. I am ready to be at a healthy weight and feel good about my body. I am ready to stop making excuses as to why I can't go out to eat with friends/family. I am ready to stop being the only person not eating at a party. I am ready to stop people from constantly asking why I'm so thin. I am ready to be a better and less miserable person.\n\nThere's no real point to this essay-length post, but I just wanted to introduce myself and put all of this down in writing. I made a similar post in /r/quittingkratom about my plans to quit that addiction and I am glad that I stumbled upon these communities so that I don't have to go through these journeys alone. \n\nPlease do feel free to comment with any questions, advice, suggestions, or personal experiences. I am also curious if anybody else has developed an ED as a result of or complement to an addiction. To anybody who read this post until the end, thank you so much for reading my words and I hope to talk with all of you at some point and provide my support and positivity in return.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I thought that they just don\u2019t care about food as much. But I realized that I was wrong.\n\nRecently, some of my friends talked about wanting to diet. And they casually talked about how they ate 800 calories in a day to effectively lose weight. Some of them said that they hadn\u2019t eaten in over a day so casually. Some of them said, laughing, that they just don\u2019t eat because they\u2019re on a \u201cdiet\u201d. Some said they\u2019ve sone Kpop diets (those that make you eat like 300 calories in a day). They talked about it like it meant nothing, like disordered eating habits were considered healthy. Me, wanting to relate, said that maybe I should start exercising and \u201cdieting\u201d too. They called me a skeleton and said I don\u2019t even need to lose any weight. My friend who looks really skinny said that I\u2019m a skeleton and that my waist is smaller than hers, which is impossible, because hers is so small. That\u2019s funny because I\u2019m not even underweight. \nIt\u2019s like everyone just has a messed up perceptions on their bodies. It upsets me because they\u2019re not even \u201cbig\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s things like this that make me think, is there anyone in the world without disordered eating habits? It\u2019s like everyone I know in real life has disordered eating habits and I don\u2019t think they even realize it. They just think of it as a diet and see no harm in it, and just laugh it off. \n\nThe next time I hear people say \u201cAsians are so skinny\u201d, let me tell you: it has nothing to do with us having a \u201csmall frame\u201d or a \u201cfast metabolism\u201d. It\u2019s because a lot of Asians have disordered eating habits due to societal pressure that one has to be skinny to be desired. (Although I am aware this is also the case in other places) appearance is something highly valued in Asian communities. It\u2019s sad but it\u2019s true. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if the words don\u2019t come out as well as I intended them to.

Now, I'm usually given shit for not having empathy but this is the person I've been most empathetic of in my entire life, other than my mom. I took their problem very seriously and many, many times, genuinely *felt* for them. I told them this, I wasn't going to stand for that treatment just because they were upset.\n\nBut I did make a mistake with the simplification. This was *not* my intention. We'd talked about it before and I really took it to heart when they said it annoys them when people with eds are treated as little girls who got warped by the evil media and beauty standards. I took it to heart and since then did research and saw for myself that they were mostly correct. And even having this in mind I still messed up, idk maybe with my wording. Either I was wrong with my presentation or they just took it that way. Either way this was a failure.\n\nHere's what they told me about recovery: they said that this lifestyle has taken them to an appearance that they're finally satisfied with, that having an ed is \"worth it\" for them and they'll only seek help when it no longer feels worth it. They kept insisting that this isn't their disorder speaking and that's just how they see themself.\n\nAnd this is where I need opinions. Because honestly, when your ideal self is underweight and you have to do all this unhealthy and harmful shit to get to your ideal sef, seems pretty fucking disordered to me. Am I wrong? Can someone please tell me if I'm just being ignorant and explain this to me?\n\nIf I'm wrong then like... I'm really scared that my friend just has shitty morals and gross opinions lmao. They've said some weird things, we've had discussions. They seem adamant that the body positivity community is wrong and extreme, that being fat and healthy is an illusion, that anyone can lose weight if they really want to. (This was very difficult for me to hear after it took me so long to stop hating my body for being, you know, *healthy* looking. I too wanted to look like a malnourished model, but I realized at some point that that's not good or normal and shouldn't be the ideal. (Ended up hating my body anyway because of dysphoria but nothing I can do there))\n\nBut despite this they've also shown concern for idols (yeah we're into kpop :,)) who seem to be having struggles with extreme dieting and food etc. My friend has said that that's terrible, that's wrong, expressed concern, said that no one should go through that etc etc.... So I'm kinda like??? Which is it honey??? Is being skinny good or bad????\n\nI don't know, please tell me if you think this is my friend's disordered thinking or if they just have shitty morals.\n\nAnd well, now I don't know what the fuck to do. I'm not mentally stable enough to try to have this conversation again. Clearly I'm doing something wrong and they are very much not ready to even consider recovery. I don't know how to cope with this. Worrying about them takes a great tool on me. I know it's selfish but... I don't know. They're doing this to themself, meanwhile I didn't sign up for this distress. And of course I'll always be affected as long as we're friends (they kept apologizing that they got me so worried and said they don't want this to affect me,,, that's not how it works honey).\n\nSo I really just don't know what to do. I don't want to end the friendship for my sake, they've said they don't want me to go either (because yes I did have an epic meltdown after their lashout) but I also can't just ignore this, this is a big part of their life.\n\nI don't know what to do.\n\nEDIT: please stop assuming my friend is a girl.

My mom has always been at me for eating too much though... she's always trying to get my dad and I to eat less at social events because she basically thinks we gorge ourselves and she's always trying to get me to lose weight. She herself is thin and exercises often.\n\nIt started with me skipping lunch. This wasn't planned, I just kept forgetting to take lunch to school and with extra murals afterwards lunch would just end up missed. But I noticed I started losing some weight from it. I think this, combined with my mother, triggered everything.\n\nI continued just skipping lunch for about a year. At the start of this year though I had a very messy breakup with my boyfriend of two years, forced by my mom, and my ex found a new girl shortly after. I was also under a lot of stress from school. I think this all accumulated about halfway through the year and I found myself skipping breakfast and lunch and restricting myself from any snacks, so I would only eat supper.\n\nThen about I started throwing my food up. I would eat a bunch of sweets or cakes and throw it all up. It didn't happen all at once, I just started hating myself for eating. My mother has always gone on about how weak my willpower is... I hated seeing myself eat. It was my willpower that was weak. So every time I ate I would hate myself a bit more. I started throwing up supper, so I would skip breakfast, lunch and then vomit up my supper.\n\nI still never lost a lot of weight. At my lowest I was 47kg, and now I'm about 50kg. I get compliments on my figure, especially if I haven't eaten that day and have been 'good' (no eating except supper and throwing that up too) the previous few days.\n\nAnd I am so terrified of my mom finding out because she reacted really badly when she found out I was cutting myself... I don't know what to do. I've been to the school counselor a few times but she can't get me on any program without my mother's involvement and I am so terrified of her finding out. I don't want to be on a program either. That's... making it real, and I don't want to admit it.\n\nI don't feel like I have the right to claim an eating disorder though, because I keep giving in anyway and eating, especially at social events. I haven't lost a lot of weight either. I just hate myself, as I sit here with my fucking bloated stomach after one sandwich that I hate myself for making.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I've been in eating disorder treatment and that's the undisputed standard of care. I've seen a lot of formerly obese/eating disordered people who have maintained healthy habits for a long time preach that this is the way to go. They do say that stricter control can be used in the beginning to make sure you are doing the right thing physically, but mainly calorie and nutrient counting and nothing like cutting out entire groups of food. The binge eating sub also seems pro intuitive eating. \n\nThen I see this sub and other food addiction sources promoting abstinence. I'm keto OMAD myself, even avoiding (but not strictly excluding) some zero carb foods that are semi-triggers for me, like cheese, salty cured sausages and diet drinks. I've been binge free for 6 months for the first time in my life. But it's still a short time, and I've always relapsed in the past. Sometimes I wonder if I'm deluding myself and it's only working because I'm redirecting my eating disorder into restriction instead of fixing the core issue. Sometimes I feel like an anti-vaxx conspiracy theorist going against the medical advice. Everyone tells me that's what is happening and I'm going to make it worse.\n\nI don't know what to believe. Is it really the case of \"whatever works for you\"? How do I know it works for me? I don't have cravings and I don't obsessively think about food anymore, but it's not effortless either.

Since I was about 14 I've been dealing with eating issues, and self esteem issues well before that.\n\nWhen I first brought my issues up to a psychologist when I was 14, she dismissed them and told me I can't have an ED because im a healthy weight. Since then, seeking treatment by myself has been extremely difficult. Time and Time again therapists and doctors just brush it off. Despite restricting on and off for almost 3 years, my health is generally fine, my weight is fine, everything's fine (even my health even though I nearly faint every single day and feel sick + weak 24/7) I'm so so sick of trying to get help because no one cares.\n\nEvery single day I wake up and my first thoughts are about food. All of my energy goes into calculating, counting, reading nutritional info, fasting, crying over food, weighing myself, checking my body, avoiding mirrors and restricting. Every day I go to bed wanting to kill myself because I \"ate too much\" or gained weight. I can't do this anymore , I don't wanna feel like this.\n\nWhile in hospital for a spinal surgery, I was seen by a mental health team. The orthopedic doctors on the ward just wanted them to check on me after surgery because of my extensive history with suicide, self harm and mental health. I opened up to them about my eating issues and they said they'd come back to see me the next week. I thought I'd finally get some help but the last thing they told me is they were calling my old mental health centre just to get some info and nothing ever happened after that as the weekend passed and I was discharged the day they said they'd come see me.\n\nThat same week, I finally snapped and opened up to my mother who didn't quite get what I was saying at first and thought I simply wanted to lose weight. She was suggesting all these things and then told me I binge eat, when really she was getting reactive and binge eating mixed up. She said she'd help me get help. She said she'd call people. She said she'd talk to my last therapist. \n\nYet nothing happened.\nNo calls. No help. Nothing. It's almost as if shes forgotten entirely. She acknowledges I need more nutrients and more food but never anything more than that.\n\nI'm too tired to talk to anyone anymore. I don't want to open up over and over and over just to keep getting shut down and ignored or neglected. I don't feel sick enough to even warrant getting help, and the fact that no one else seems to think I'm sick enough either only adds to that. I'm so so tired... I'm tired of my suicidal ideation getting worse every day because of my eating issues. I don't know what to do anymore. The closest thing I can get to help is a school counselor who's willing to try to help but I have my doubts about it working, plus school is out until February next year.
