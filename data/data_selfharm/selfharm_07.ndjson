I don't even remember what compelled me to do it, and somehow I was completely oblivious to the fact that I'm very clearly depressed a lot of the time. Even after I started cutting, I didn't believe I was depressed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt wasn't until yesterday, after a particularly terrible series of cuts, I talked some about how I had been feeling recently to some of my closest friends (over text, of course - lord knows I don't have the courage to vocalize anything like that right now). It was in our group chat, and we've all known each other for about 12 years now, and (stupidly) I've always been afraid of revealing too much about my feelings in fear of them seeing me differently or something. I only accidentally told them that I had been cutting, in the middle of a huge message that was basically just my stream of consciousness. I never intended to let them know I had been.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThankfully, they were all extremely supportive. A couple of them have experience with mental health issues, but none of them have ever self harmed, but the sympathy was welcome. They helped me find some good therapists in my area, which I hope I'll soon have the energy to look into, and we had a long discussion about what'd been going on. It was so relieving to finally put some of this stuff down in words, and it also helped me work through what my thoughts actually were. I went to bed grateful of their love, with some much-needed bandages on my leg.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut today... I couldn't help it. I couldn't get myself to reach out to them, like they said they wanted me too, and I truly wanted to as well. I guess I broke that promise I made my girlfriend to talk to her first before I felt like this again. I cut deeper than I used to, deeper than I ever meant to, at least. And then I got to enjoy feeling ashamed on a whole nother level, because at least before now, I felt like I was in control, I chose when to cut, it was my own doing, but knowing I had someone I could talk to who could help me with my feelings and yet still cutting, I feel like I was dumb for ever thinking I had an ounce of agency. Dumb and weak for not being able to resist the urge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess I know now why this struggle lasts for years and years for some people. Earlier in my life, I never thought I would be doing this kind of thing, but here we are, as I type this, my thigh bleeding anew. I feel like posting this is kind of useless, but maybe, just maybe, because I know y'all can truly relate, I might be able to find some solace in this community. People I can say these things around who I know won't think differently of me, because you don't know me yet, so I can be truly honest.

So I have no way out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, to get back on topic, he was particularly nasty this last Friday and I left work feeling so enraged, defeated and helpless that I could scarcely process the rage I was feeling. When I got home I went to change out of my work clothes and wash my face. I had grabbed a box cutter to open an amazon package that had some face cleaning wipes in it and before I even knew what happened, I was screaming and bawling and repeatedly stabbing and slashing at my left arm. 30+ wounds, all different directions, I didn't even think about it, I just did it, there was no reason, just impotent rage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a huge mess, my bathroom looked like a crime scene, more blood than I have ever seen come out of me. I t was startlingly gruesome. My husband was understandably horrified but tried his best to comfort me and tell me that it's okay, but I am just so shocked and ashamed that I did this. I have pretty regular problems with anxiety, but never anything like this. I don't know what to do. Is this going to happen again? The thought of me losing control hurting someone else terrifies me. I am literally afraid of myself now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long rant, I just need to process this and there aren't a lot of options where that felt safe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited for typo.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

When I was l younger, I would cut whenever I wanted to. I used self harm to numb my entire middle school years, and it worked like a charm. And in those first few years, when my parents saw my cuts, they pitied me. They would coddle me and let me cry and support me. But as I got older, and as my self harm continued and got more worse (resulting in trips to the ER for stitches instead of trips to walgreens for bandaids), they got tired of it, and I began to get punished when I relapsed. I got my phone taken and my room raided and I was grounded for months at a time. I don\u2019t hold it against them at all - they\u2019re just doing their best, and it\u2019s kept me from hurting myself. \nHowever, it hasn\u2019t kept me from wanting to cut. I fantasize about it daily. Every waking moment I picture slicing my skin open and my skin tingles in anticipation. But I know that if I give in, I\u2019ll have hell to pay. The only time I\u2019ve gotten away with it in recent years (as in my parents found out and they were all gushy and supportive) is when I saw my dog die after he got hit by a car. \nThat was the worst day of my life. Not only did I my best friend, but I had to watch it happen. And so when I sliced my arms open and had to get nine stitches, they understood. \nI keep going back to that feeling of my mom hugging me before I went to the ER. Her telling me that she loves me and cares about me. And I just want that again. I want to relapse and I want to be comforted, not scolded.

If the format sucks, blame the fact that I'm on mobile.\n\nI feel the need to get this off my chest. It's not much, and it's pretty underwhelming, but here we go.\n\nIn the sixth grade, I had started suffering ruthless bullying at the hands of my peers. They talked behind my back, started rumors and humiliated me. Because of this, my grades had started falling, and my mental state was decaying. Due to the fact that people would often harass me or talk about me on the bus, I started listening to music. It was an escape from that psychological torment. Really, it was the thing that made me start properly developing my music taste. But it was only a distraction, not a solution. One day, I was walking home from school completely in tears. I came into the house, and nobody was home. I felt completely isolated and wasn't thinking straight. That was the day I started self harming.\n\nI began giving into those urges that came after the first incident, and a one-time thing became a habit. It was...a punishment, I guess. My brain was so screwed up that it decided I deserved to be punished for being bullied. I started wearing hoodies to cover up the cuts on my arms. They were never deep. They were shallow, like the kind of cut you would get if a cat scratched you. But they left scars. In the beginning of seventh grade, I had a breakdown one night when I had gym class the next day. I couldn't wear a hoodie. I arrived to class with my arms covered in fresh cuts, and I was completely humiliated. A classmate approached me, worried about me. I tried to get her to stop, as her questions and statements that \"if you kill yourself, you'll make people sad\" weren't helping me. They were really just hurting me. I began cutting more often, punishing myself for any slight thing that was wrong. I promised a friend I met online that I would throw away the knife in the forest. I never did. \n\nThis past school year was eighth grade. I had found friends online, and even started a relationship. My self harm habits were a lot more sporadic. I was able to keep streaks of not hurting myself for weeks, occasionally even a month or two. I think my longest time clean was two or three months. A lot of things happened. My girlfriend broke up with me, I was manipulated into hating her, you know. The usual. Luckily, I'm still friends with my ex. Recently I started self harming again, even though school is over and I'm not suffering from that endless torture. I might be moving in with my dad soon, which means I'd be able to start anew at a different school. That would be pretty good for my mental health.\n\nI'm really sorry for rambling on, this post was way too long. I just had a lot of things I wanted to talk about.

Ive harmed myself in almost everyway. Cutting, hitting, picking, asphyxiation (Rip stretchy shorts waistband) etc. Still, I REALLY want to cut but I can't handle my parents being disappointed in me. The only way I really stopped my self harm was when I got admitted to a mental health hospital and met these really sweet girls. One of them had just times 13 and she had so many cuts, all of them were infected. She also took her Benadryl, good it under her tumg and fucking ground it up and snorted it. She was basically 12 I felt so bad for her, she was a very sweet, but weird girl. The moment that made me stop cutting is when I realized that I wanted something better. When I smuggled some alcohol wipes from my locker and got her to clean her cut, by lots of persuasion. I asked her what she was using and she was using Rusty metal and shit so I asked why and she just told me, \"I don't care.\" Not in that edgy way but it just felt so raw and do honest. The next day she drank a bottle of shampoo, in a failed suicide attempt. Luckily she let me turn her into the nurse. I don't know why but it made me want to do better for her. I know this is dumb but yeah. There were all these people who were so wonderful and sweet and the fact that they were hiring themselves blew my mind. They didn't deserve to be hurting and mabey I didn't either. I don't know. The biggest reason I stopped was for my dad. My dad had anxiety disorder and my mom had depression. So I'm a combo of both. My dad always ended up blaming himself or something worse and it just made me feel even more terrible letting him down like that. I guess the only reason I'm doing this is for my parents. I honestly don't really mind the pain or the scars. I've had a pretty easy life and I feel like I don't deserve to be depressed, my parents both love me just the way they show it sometimes isn't great. My dad broke down a door because he thought I was cutting, (I wasn't) and I ended up hyperventilating and sobbing on the floor to the point where afterwards it hurt to breathe. My mom had told me from a very young age that shed send me to a mental hospital if told her i was depressed. Elementary was a lot of physical bullying. Then middle School hit and that came with a fuck ton of sexual harassment from unwanted kisses to lots of groping. In eight grade I pressed a knife into my throat then decided to call my friend and she picked up and we talked for a couple hours. Fires, shootings, deaths. A lot happened. Then mother fucking highschool. I started cutting more and then I started hearing these voices. (I don't have schizophrenia, my doctor's figured out it was from my extreme depression and anxiety and luckily not sycosis.) The voices were triggered from one specific event. There was this kid who had a crush on my friend and it ended up with my calling the police on him and sending him to a mental hospital after the threat if him shooting himself and a lot more. While he was in the cop car he was texting me furiously. I could tell he was crying and I could almost here his screams at me to tell the police I was lying and get them to stop. It was a wellness check so they must have found something that proceed what I told them. The next day I felt like I was dying. That night I started hearing these voices, there were 4 of them. Like people talking through my mouth and I ended up a ball on the floor talking to myself while my parents freaked out. Next day, I went to my group therapy class and ended up quietly talking to myself the entire session and writing furiously all over my arms. I had a plan, a suicide plan. To sit in the bathtub with my phone, my stash of razors and slit one of my wrists so I could call 911 and not booked out before they came. It was more for attention than anything, I needed help bit somehow a suicide attempt felt easier than just telling my parents. I ended up telling the counselor lady since I'm terrible at keeping secrets.  I went straight to the er. Luckily it was a week after my carving session so I wasn't a fucking mess and I just say there petrified. I arrived at 3 am. The first night I was so fucking angry at myself and just paced, cried, talked to myself, and wrote furiously. The rooms were terrible. The beds were uncovered air mattresses with a thin sheet, open windows that faced the street and the entire room was covered in drawings and messages. I got out after a few days. Made a few friends, still haven't been able to call them since and I liked of wanted to stay forever. You didn't have to make any decisions. You just played cards and watched TV. It felt nice, no stress. But that's really no way to live is it?\n\nI don't know where I'm going with this.

{"post_id": "c8mh3d", "created_utc": 1562149803, "title": "I was sent to residential care for cutting and suicidality", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "I saw a post from people talking about being afraid of being sent to residential.  I was involuntarily sent to residential after being hospitalized three times.\n\nI was hospitalized once in 2017 for \u201csuicidal rehearsal\u201d like basically acting out how I planned to eventually kill myself.  I kept cutting after. I got out of the hospital and cut myself that night and continued cutting after. So in August of 2018 I cut extremely bad and went to an ER where they committed me. They put me back on medication and then released me and then I cut myself again a little bit and took four trazadone. I told my friend who called 911 and they committed me again. The new psychiatrist I had said they wouldn\u2019t release me unless I agreed to go to residential and would keep me indefinitely. \n\nThey only recommended two places and were unwilling to work with my father to find somewhere to send me, they apparently would just ask if he found somewhere to place me yet, and my dad was out of the country and didn\u2019t know what he was doing.  My mom doesn\u2019t give a fuck about me so she wouldn\u2019t help at all.  So my dad called a residential which rejected me because he made me sound like a maniac.  So the only other place the hospital recommended was a drug treatment/dual diagnosis place in Florida.  I don\u2019t have and have never had a drug or alcohol problem and live four states away from Florida. My dad flew home from Asia and took me to Florida.\n\nAs soon as I got there I knew I was fucked.  The \u201ctreatment center\u201d was a small office-looking building in a medical office park.  It was just the building and a patio for smoking and a parking lot.  They made me strip in a bathroom in front of a female employee to search me for drugs.  I was so upset I cried and screamed and then fell asleep.  At dinner I was taken downstairs and was so numb and in shock I couldn\u2019t eat or swallow or chew. I think I even said, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m going to have a seizure\u201d.  They tried to take me to the nurses station and I collapsed and hit my head. They asked me to go the hospital so I agreed and was barely conscious. I had had a lot of seizures that summer.  At the hospital they stripped me and locked me in a psych ER room and wouldn\u2019t explain to me what was going on. When I asked they said it was because I was \u201cslamming my head on the ground\u201d which was what the treatment center told them,  which I obviously wasn\u2019t, and Baker Acted me.  \n\nSo I went back to the treatment center after a week.  And being in such terrible conditions and being so traumatized and humiliated, I was okay with being there. We were forcibly woken up everyday, even on Weekends, at like 7:30 am.  You aren\u2019t allowed to have access to computers or any electronic devices.  They made us do groups everyday from like morning until evening and you were not allowed to no participate.  You did get breaks in between so all I did and what everyone else did was lay in bed.  \n\nI never saw an actual psychiatrist.  I saw a nurse practitioner and they agreed with the psychiatrist at the hospital in my home state that I\u2019m actually Bipolar (no psychiatrist or doctor I\u2019ve seen or saw before thinks I\u2019m bipolar and neither do I). They asked me if I had any trauma and I said yes and diagnosed me as having PTSD.  They also diagnosed me as borderline.  These are not my primary problems and honestly I don\u2019t think I have BPD, Bipolar, or PTSD.  \n\nThey kept me there for like two weeks and then sent me to \u201cPHP\u201d where you lived in apartments in the ghetto and were taken in vans at 8 am each day to the treatment center a block away and forced to participate in groups.  I hated it and didn\u2019t want to be there and they refused to let me leave or they call the police on you to commit you.  They also had lied to me before and said the second phase lasted two weeks and it was so much better and you had more freedom.  It lasts a month and you have no more freedom than before.  They thought me wanting to leave was a symptom of OCD and the nurse practitioner wanted to put me on Luvox again, which seems to have caused my seizures, and I think at this point I was on buspar, 200 mg trazadone, and latuda. \n\nSo I got sent to hospital again and then sent back to the original treatment facility connected to the same company.\n\nAt the hospital they doubled the latuda.  So when I was at the treatment center on like 200 mg of Latuda each week from like the early afternoon until I fell asleep at like 1 am I was having these episodes where my eyes rolled up into the back of my head leaving me unable to look down or see anything and I was unable to move my muscles or my body at all.  I was like a statue and I\u2019d get locked into certain positions like holding my arms in the air to adjust my blanket. My blood pressure would also skyrocket.  The nurses and therapists and staff did not know what this was and said it was an anxiety attack. It\u2019s actually a serious side effect from antipsychotics called acute dystonia/oculogyric crisis. But they didn\u2019t know this for some reason and let me keep having these episodes every single week.  \n\nAlso the first day I was back my new roommate lied about me threatening to hurt or kill her because she wanted to room with another girl so they separated me from her. She did not get in trouble for accusing me of threatening to kill her.  \n\nSo eventually they decided that shit wasn\u2019t working out with this company and I couldn\u2019t continue in this program and I could go to the other treatment center they recommended in the hospital initially.\n\nSo my dad came and got me and took me to Disney for a few days and then we drove to the next treatment center.  I was so drugged on Latuda for the evaluation period I could physically not stay awake, but I got accepted and was happy.\n\nAt this place they had computers to use and WiFi.  You had your own room and bathroom in like college dorms.  They had like a huge campus with paths cars could drive on and greenhouses and a farm and a building for doing art as well as a main building.  Each morning we woke ourselves up and then there was breakfast and a meeting and then you did farm work. You could choose between taking care of animals, working in the greenhouse, wood shop, or gardening. I choose gardening.  You got an hour off for lunch. The food was this healthy shit like vegan food and fish and it was so bad, lol.  The food was the worst part of being there.  After the work crew you had therapy groups which weren\u2019t mandatory but I\u2019d you just never attended anything you couldn\u2019t move on to the next optional step of the program.  The groups were like DBT, yoga, movement therapy, meditation and then a women\u2019s group and men\u2019s group. They also had AA meetings and Refuge Recovery they would take you to and a bible study group.  \n\nYou saw the psychiatrist like once every two weeks and the therapist individually once a week.  Every other Friday they would take you on an outing.  I remember we went to the movies, a coffee shop indie music show, go-karting and a Christmas lights show. Each weekend you went on two outings - one free and one paid - and yeah we went to the movies, go karting, Barnes and Noble,  Mimi golf, mall, hiking, afternoon tea, rock climbing and in the summer they apparently have more seasonal activists like swimming at the lake or tubing.  Every months we went to eat at a restaurant once. You could also leave with a family member and I went out with my dad yo nearby cities twice.\n\nThey were super accommodating and arranged for me to join a local orchestra and take music lessons at a local college.  A lot of people had autism and they took us to occupational therapy and I got diagnosed with autism.\n\nAfter like two months I said I wanted to leave and they said I could if I wanted to and worked to create a plan for me to leave safely.  So I got to leave in early March.\n\nBeing at residential did not help me much in the long run and I\u2019m still really dysfunctional and suicidal, but I don\u2019t cut myself.  I think about death like everyday honestly, lol.  So the first one was horrendous and the second once while being like a solid B experience didn\u2019t help me much in the long run.", "subreddit": "MadeOfStyrofoam"}

This is nothing more than an observation.  \n\nSo pretty much as the title says. I've had this idea for some time, but I think last night confirmed my suspicions----this was the first time in a few months. So yeah, yesterday was pretty rough (internally). I was the most social I've been in a while as I'm pretty much a loner and have social anxiety. But I can force myself to be uh \"normal\" if need be. That said, it's not easy. I spent most of the day with others and it reminded me how selective I have to be with my words and actions. A minor example is when I ran into a classmate (female) and the next thing I know everyone is taking about how cute she is and how I know her; if we're dating; or I'm going to take her to party or; or what's she like. Even when I made it clear I just know get from school they bring it up again a few hours later. It happends every **single time** even so much as a mutual \"hello\" is exchanged. \n\nBesides that example and worse others, throughout the day I get emotions like anger, sadness, fatigue and so on. And in addition to that, when I see people I just get an empty feeling. And this seems to happen everytime I'm out and about. Alone, I feel safe or at least more relaxed than anytime with others. I don't have to act or be the person I'm expected to be.\n\nBut anyway, once the night came the need to cut was as strong as it's been for some time. I was fighting it pretty well until I saw a shard of glass (I recently broke a lamp). For whatever reason all thought escaped me: I grab the shard and just did it. And I kept going. These weren't the worse cuts I've made but probably the most I've done at a time. Arms, legs back, chest. I couldn't really stop until I booted up the Witcher 3 to distract me. When I was finally able to settle down a little and go to bed, my insomnia and sleep paralysis kicked in like 6 times. I'm actually kinda sore right now after it all.\n\nAll this in one night.

I\u2019m trying to work through it, but i can\u2019t get over it overnight. All the apartments around mine are filled with children. I hate children because loud screaming and stuff like that can set me on edge right away. I live in an upstairs apartment, and the children seem to think it\u2019s ok to play on the stairs and to scream and play loud music while doing it. I\u2019ve tried to explain to them why the stairs aren\u2019t for play and are not meant for hanging out around, but they just don\u2019t care. I get that they need to play, I\u2019m not trying to be a dick, and I also don\u2019t think they should be playing on stairs, especially without supervision. And none of them live upstairs, so there\u2019s really no reason for them to even be playing on the stairs or be on them in the first place. In fact, after I have told them to get off, they are now making even more noise, and I am currently on the verge of a panic attack because there is literally nowhere in my apartment I can go where I can\u2019t hear it. I also can\u2019t listen to music, because the loud banging goes straight through the music. There have been many complaints about the kids in our section of the complex (so it\u2019s not just me and my mom complaining, as we\u2019ve never said anything to the management) and the management simply sent out a short notice to watch your kids. Which, didn\u2019t help anything as they still run around with no supervision. I really hate confrontation, and I\u2019ve tried to be polite about it to them. I\u2019m not sure what to do, as the parents don\u2019t seem to care what happens. All this stress is making me want to tear apart my arm, and just try to ignore the panic and fear and instead focus on the pain. Also our lease isn\u2019t up for another month, and it would cost a lot of money as a penalty for breaking a lease. As soon as our lease is up, we are moving out ASAP. Sorry for the paragraph, I just felt the need to put my thoughts somewhere in an attempt to calm myself down.

So, for some background on C, she is a manipulative sociopath. C *really* wants her son and I to get married to she can be related to my mom by marriage, he\u2019s a cool guy and he\u2019s cute and all but I don\u2019t like him that way and I have a boyfriend that I love so much and I wouldn\u2019t give him up for this kid, especially with his mom treating me like this. She kept showing me pictures of him, telling me how amazing he is at sports, she kept telling me how beautiful I am and just being creepy. I got real uncomfortable quick, my mom told C to leave me alone, but low and behold, C didn\u2019t leave me alone. She kept harrassing me about marrying her son, asking me weird questions about my family, my friends, and my boyfriend especially when she was awake (she fell asleep like an hour in to our visit and stayed asleep for about an hour and a half.) When we got home I told my dad about what happened today and he got mad that my mom took us there. He talked to her about it (not what I said, about taking us to C in the first place) because C is a bad person and he doesn\u2019t want his children around her. He\u2019s expressed this to her multiple times but she doesn\u2019t listen because C is her drinking buddy. They got very drunk while they were there (both were already intoxicated when we got there) and my mom was still wasted.\n\n[TL;DR: Mom took me to creepy friend\u2019s house, dad didn\u2019t approve and they got into an arguement]\n\nNow let\u2019s get to what happened that involves me.\n\nAfter my dad talked to my mom, my mom came back to my bedroom and started yelling at me like I had tried to kill her dog. She was calling me  a liar, ungrateful, horrible, bitchy, etc. and said that I should appreciate her and everything she does for me (it\u2019s not relevant to what she was mad about but she said that) and that she wouldn\u2019t do anything for me anymore if I keep \u201cgiving my dad excuses to yell at her.\u201d After she left my room, slamming the door behind her, she said loud enough for me to hear \u201cwhy don\u2019t you go cut your wrists or something.\u201d I was shocked, she had said things like this to me before but still. I quickly responded \u201cmaybe I will then!\u201d She came back in and said that she would call the hospital and have me put into an institution if I did anything to myself. I was confused as hell. She said if I didn\u2019t go into my parent\u2019s room and sleep in with my dad that night she\u2019d call an ambulance to keep me from killing myself (I know, what the fuck woman.) I took 5 almost one year expired asthma pills out of anger and fear. I\u2019m okay, but I wished I took more last night because of what happened today. \n\n[TL;DR: Mom blamed me for my dad yelling at her, told me to cut myself, then threatened to call a hospital]\n\n\nThis morning while I was eating breakfast my mom was still very drunk and started lecturing me about how horrible I am and how much I hate her and how horrible of a mom she is (emotional backamail is her go-to to get her way.) Later, she was yelling at my sister to get her stuff together to go to her friend\u2019s house. I got mad because my sister (10 y/o autistic kid) did nothing wrong and my mom was yelling at her. I told my mom to leave my sister alone, and she told me to shut up and told me that I \u201ccouldn\u2019t talk to her like that\u201d (but she can tell me to cut myself?) My mom made sure to let me know how much she loved me before she left by flipping me off with both of her middle fingers before she left to get more drunk at another friend\u2019s house. I had a peaceful day with my dad but when she got home she was still making rude remarks aimed at me but not directly saying anything to me. Last thing I heard from her was something about \u2018getting revenge\u2019 and at the very end of her tangent she said \u201cEnjoy, Victim-Of-Life\u201d and went outside to get more drunk.\n\n[TL;DR: Mom still being drunk and angry, flipping me off, and plotting some sort of revenge for whatever I did to her]\n\nWhat should I do? I don\u2019t feel safe in my own home with this woman around. I don\u2019t know how to handle this, she hasn\u2019t been this bad to me all at once before.

Only one person in my close circle of people knows and that's only because they caught me when I was at my worst. I'm not suicidal and never have been.

Updates and a weirdass rant", "author": "Ghoulsie", "self_text": "So update on my last thing: right when I was going to fucking try to cut through an artery or something else important, my mom immediately wanted to go shopping and I had to come. When I got back I was having really bad headaches. You know like those kinds of headaches you get when you've been holding tears back practically all day. Yeah I had one of those. But I still felt numb. I just needed a good cry and some good old fashioned deep cuts. I was going to try to cut through important stuff. \ud83d\ude2c It didn't fucking work and my deadass plastic blade broke. It literally broke. Like when does that even happen tf. The cut wasn't as epic as I wanted to be and only the fat was exposed, but not even really damaged. Hhhhhhhhh I'm sad. Also my older cuts are so damn itchy that I could just rip my skin off. I can already tell they're gonna leave pretty bad scars that I'll have for my entire life but oh well. I've been hiding them, but that's really hard to do in summer. I'm sad because my mom wants me to wear all of these dresses she got me from goodwill (\ud83d\udc4c) but I don't want her to see my scars. She doesn't know that I cut, even though I've been doing it for years. She would freak out. But, I just can't help but feel like shit for not wearing those dresses and I'm probably coming off as rude now. I really appreciate her getting me clothes but I can't wear them.\nMost of you guys seem to be clean and I just wanted to say that you are all amazing! It takes a lot of strength to overcome all of this shit and I really respect you!  I feel weird now because when I think about it, I don't even know if I actually want to move on. Self harm is all I have. Sometimes I feel like the best part of my day is when I can just come home and butcher the shit out of my arms. I use self harm as a way of punishing myself and making myself feel better at the same time? I don't know, I'm not entirely sure what I'm getting out of it, all I know is that I can't stop. \n  I really hate it when I'm looking for some good, real medical advice on how to care for self ham scars and prevent infection (This always happens on quora) I make it into a question and post it, but I don't get any actual good medical advice, just people who have never self harmed before and have no fucking idea what we are going through telling me that my cut (which is so deep I could get life threatening infections) will be fine and will heal in like two days. Then, they go on to say that I just need to quit self harming today and go to a mental hospital. It is not easy to fucking stop self harming for one day let alone quit forever, right this minute! And I never asked about my mental health. \nIt would be one thing if they just said that if I can, I should try to get mental help, but to answer the question without even giving medical advice and to basically rant at my for like 6 paragraphs about how what I'm doing is not okay or socially acceptable and how I need to quit right now is just kind of crappy. Speaking of rants, I'm sorry that this turned into one, but I hate it when people just act like they know everything about mental health, but they just have an associates degree in theatre or something and have never had any mental health issues in their lives.

It was more for me than him, really. It helped with all the minor urges, and when I had a major urge I would text him. It worked for a while. Until today.\n\nYesterday, I went to my friend Violet\u2019s house for her family\u2019s Fourth of July bbq and fireworks. Her parents are super chill, and let us have some of the alcohol. Charlie, who is Violet\u2019s boyfriend, wasn\u2019t there because he can\u2019t handle being around people who are intoxicated. It\u2019s actually really bad, he\u2019ll have a panic attack.\n\nThis morning, I woke up to Violet screaming at Charlie over the phone. Apparently he had told her that he would rather talk to her after she cut (she used to, and she\u2019s relapsed a couple times recently, but she\u2019s doing way better than I am) than when she\u2019s intoxicated. She was screaming and crying, saying she was disgusted with him, asking why he would ever say something like that. I couldn\u2019t help but think about how he\u2019s been helping me so much with not cutting, but I drank last night too, not much but I did drink, then he went and said that. \n\nAnyways, I got home today, and immediately went for my blade. It was different though. I was so calm. I don\u2019t even feel bad that I broke my streak. I don\u2019t really feel anything. I just feel empty. So yeah. That\u2019s fun.\n\nThanks for reading this long ass vent.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

When she noticed, instead of getting mad or lecturing me, she actually asked for my perspective and let me tell her what was going on, and within the ten minutes we had before school started, she gave me some pretty good advice.\n\nMy friend from musical is very very sweet about it. She isn't overbearing, but she does care. For example, when I was at her place, we were going to watch Sweeney Todd. Before she put it on she asked me if the movie was gonna trigger me because there were a lot of razors. I told her it was totally fine, and we ended up loving it. Also, she knows I use fidget toys to distract myself, and I had ended up leaving my putty at home accidentally. She noticed I didn't have it and let me borrow her squishy fidget toy for the night. I was so grateful for that. \n\nNow, to the not so good.\n\nMy mom is very involved with my self harm, but at the same time, not in a good way. She'll yell and blame things that help me. She'll barge in, demand I tear apart my bed so she can look for razors, and when she sees a chocolate stain, accuse it of being blood. She'll get all emotional but at the same time make it about her or use it to get angry about things about me she doesn't like.\n\nThen there are my teachers.\n\nI had a really mean history teacher last year. All of a sudden she just reports me to guidance, not saying a word to me about it. At least she said she'd understand if I wanted to go to guidance.\n\nThen there was the worst method out of my teachers. I'm in the gifted program, and the teacher for the program handled it horribly. She let me think I got away with it, then forced the most awkward confrontation possible, and kept demanding I look at her, and then said I needed better 'situational awareness'.\n\nAnother horrible incident was last week when I was at a film camp. They didn't ask if my scars were new or old. They didn't even ask if it was self harm. They just called my mom and threatened to kick me out because I was a 'liability'. Thanks. Cus threats are how you help, amiright?\n\nIDK, maybe this will give people ideas if they're looking to help someone.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I was playing with penknife with the serrated saw blade pressed against my arm, just enough so the teeth of the blade were catching my skin. \n\nA memory came into my mind, I can\u2019t remember exactly what it was but it was like a painfully awkward moment in my life, I\u2019m guessing it was something from school because a lot of these memories are. (It\u2019s like moments where I\u2019ve said the wrong thing, misinterpreted someone and made a dick of myself or anything that was just painfully embarrassing/cringey)\n\nAs I relived this memory I instinctively flinched and dug the knife in, not slashing (cos that\u2019d be fuckin messy) but just pressed it really hard until all of the teeth were in my arm. \n\nIn that moment I realised the route of my self harm. The rejection from my peers I\u2019ve had all the way from primary school to high school and even now, I learned to inflict physical pain on myself as a response to the emotional pain of rejection.\n\nI\u2019d always seen it as using physical pain to escape emotional pain, and maybe it is that too, but it\u2019s mainly a punishment for the times I\u2019ve fucked up (mostly in in social situations).\n\nI feel slightly better for knowing this, I\u2019m more aware of why I am the way I am. But I just feel broken. I feel like my brain doesn\u2019t work the way it should, why can\u2019t I just learn from these memories instead of replaying them every few weeks or months or years in my head just to beat myself up over it.\n\nWhat scares me is that I\u2019m replaying these memories of school still. These memories aren\u2019t really traumatic, just extremely uncomfortable. I\u2019ve got unresolved trauma from other shit and I just don\u2019t know how I\u2019m gonna deal with it, or maybe I have already and I wasn\u2019t that bad(?)... I doubt it though.

I don\u2019t mean the usual self harm. But the thought where you have stopped trying to control the urges and you are genuinely afraid of what you are capable of. I get very vivid ideas of what I want when I self harm. Wether that be to be worse than the last time or for it to look a certain way. Recently I\u2019ve had a few thoughts that I\u2019m concerned I\u2019ll actually go through with. These very specific thoughts and locations of self harm don\u2019t go away until I accomplish those specific urges. I am tired of going back and forth from the ER but I don\u2019t know what else to do. What are you supposed to do when you are worried of what you selfishly desire. Do I tell someone that I want to cause myself some serious damage or do I just keep it quiet so I don\u2019t accidentally reinforce the self harm. It\u2019s just weird how specifically I want to hurt myself. It\u2019s obviously some form of self sabotage and looking for accomplishment and in a weird way it works. Not a good way just a weird and dangerous way. I\u2019ve never let myself go any worse than needing stitches or staples, but a part of me wants to exceed that and do something worse.

I've been self harming now for about 4 years. However, up until this point, I haven't been discovered. I've told two people: (1) a close friend when I was drink, but he's since forgotten about it after a psychotic episode; (2) my girlfriend\u2014she actually saw a cut on my wrist from a suicide attempt this year. I didn't want to tell her I'd tried suicide, so I gave a white lie and admitted to self harm, and told her I'd stop. Since she's only seen my self harm on my wrist she assumes I only self harm on visible locations, but of course I've continued to SH on my chest, upper arms, legs, etc. without her knowledge.  \n  \nAnyway\u2014I've been able to keep it under wraps, but now it's getting hard. I got much worse this past year and I now have scars on my upper arms and lower legs; I avoid wearing t-shirts and shorts, which actually isn't too difficult, but if I'm put in a situation where I *have* to wear a bathing suit, everyone will see.  \n  \nBut I assumed that through strategic excuses, I'd be able to avoid that until I'm financially independent (or until I've killed myself, whichever comes first). But I just made a cut on my lower arm (it's been a rough weekend), and it was a huge mistake. I knew immediately that this will scar, which is something I've been avoiding. There's no easy excuse for this. I'm gonna try to cover it up with makeup for as long as I can, but something tells me that's not gonna work.  \n  \nSo to all of you who have been discovered by your parents, friends, etc.: What was it like? I'm terrified. I never want my parents to find out that I'm broken; all of my suicide attempts have been at college, when they're not around so they couldn't catch me.

But just because there are no cuts doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t scars. They are littered over my body and they taunt me when I feel the need to cut. They dance around my skin, begging me to create some more family for them. Some friends they have never seen. Everyday I have to look at my arms and be disgusted with that. Be disgusted with what I\u2019ve done to myself. But even though I\u2019m disgusted, it won\u2019t stop me. I still find the need to do it. The pain makes sense of my demons. But it also shows them they have won. Because not only are they attacking mentally, but psychically too. There\u2019s nothing I can do to stop the mental attacks but the psychical seems to be out of my control too. I feel as if I\u2019m running on instinct and right now cutting is ingrained into my DNA. It doesn\u2019t matter if I don\u2019t pick up a razor blade for 5 weeks, 5 months, 5 years or 5 decades. There will always be that want and need. I am weak and weak people do what is easy because it is so much simpler than not cutting, \nWhen I look at my scars, I can still remember when I did each of them. I can still remember the blood oozing out of them and I can remember why I did it. Well, there are several reasons for why I did it. Here they are: to feel happy, to feel control, to be focused on it and not focused on my demons in my head but just to feel too I guess. Mental pain is difficult because you feel as if it didn\u2019t happen once it\u2019s over. I guess the cuts and scars are validation that you\u2019re actually going through something. It isn\u2019t so you can cry out for attention and be a baby about. It\u2019s so you know yourself that you are suffering. It\u2019s so you validate what you\u2019re going through. I find it\u2019s hardest to validate why you\u2019re going through to yourself because you always think \u201csomeone has it way worse.\u201d \nI guess my ranting is getting exhausting so I\u2019ll just go now.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

HE WAS CUTTING. he put around twenty slits into his thigh. i asked him \u201cwhy would you do that?\u201d and he simply shrugged his shoulders at me. \u201cyour turn\u201d, says AB. i remembered the pact. i thought to myself \u201cthis is just to help each other. just do it so he doesn\u2019t do it again\u201d, so i did. i put around 40 slits into my right thigh because i had to double his. \n\nthe next day we hung out again. he asked that i didn\u2019t bring my longboard to hang out with him, to which i didn\u2019t think twice about. i got in my dad\u2019s car and drove downtown to meet up with him and his friends. we met at a tim hortons and AB suggested that we go to a nearby abandoned house. the only issue? they ALL HAD BIKES WITH THEM. i ran about 6km in around 25 minutes to get to this house and had to do the same getting back. the whole time, AB is yelling at me to hurry up and stay with the group. \n\nFAST FORWARD TO 11PM THAT NIGHT. \n\nall the rest of our friends are gone, it\u2019s just us. out past curfew alone with nothing to do. so i suggest we go to a local park. we sit there for a bit until he gets bored. AB says \u201cwe should go to the park by the lake instead\u201d. (this park was about 5km away from the one we were currently at.) please note that AB STILL HAS HIS BIKE. he yells at me to follow him, so i do. about 2km behind us, AB has the nerve to say \u201crun faster, you need the cardio.\u201d i was in SHOCK but followed his command. we get to this park and sit there for about 4 hours in silence. \n\nsunrise comes, and we move to a rock to watch it together. he lifts my shorts to see the cuts on my thigh, and laughs at them. i ask \u201cwhy are you laughing? i did this because you did\u201d and he keeps laughing and tells me to pay attention to the sunrise. we walk all the way up to my house (about 12km away from where we were, ALL UPHILL.) the whole time he\u2019s still yelling at me to keep up with him. we get to my house and he gives me a kiss goodbye and i walk in. the second i get up to my room, i get a text. \n\n\u201ci didn\u2019t actually cut\u201d\n\nyeah. AB faked cutting so i would pity him and do it myself. \n\ni had a trip for dance to LA two days later, and every day of that trip i was starving, cutting, the whole shabang pretty much. AB was going to camp halfway through my trip, and we got back on the same day. i was in LA for seventeen days, so on day ten of my trip-i had no communication with him for seven days straight. i started opening up to some of the girls in my group and told them the stuff he was saying about me needing cardio, not liking how i was posing because i \u201clooked weird\u201d, faking cutting when we had a pact etc. they all told me i was being abused. i didn\u2019t believe them, and pretty much shut them out for the rest of my trip. i decided to \u201cshut off\u201d my feelings for him to make not talking to him easier on me\u201d\n\nFAST FORWARD - AB and i are back from our trips. \n\ni quickly realize that my feelings for him aren\u2019t coming back, and call AB\u2019s best friend nathan and i tell him that i want to break up with AB. he tells me \u201cgo out on a date with him. go to a nice restaurant and then see a movie and then make your decision\u201d i responded. \n\n\u201cnathan, he wouldn\u2019t let me eat.\u201d\n\nthat\u2019s when i knew what i needed to do. i called AB and broke up with him. \n\ntwo years later, i have wide and deep scars covering the tops of both of my thighs and white but very prominent scars on my left wrist. the only cuts i wanted to inflict on myself were the ones on top of my forearm. i\u2019m scared to wear shorts, go swimming, anything. i don\u2019t want people to ask if i\u2019m okay, or what made me do such a thing to myself, because i don\u2019t wanna explain to them that it was because of a pact with my abusive ex boyfriend.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Her husband worked with my dad many, many years ago, and her kids are about my age. Given some of that chats I have had with her during my appointment, she seems to be a \"hip\" parent -- she once asked me if I drank and she's mentioned to me about her nieces and nephews drinking underage, she was calling them dumb for leaving beer bottles around the house. Anyways -- I have a friend who works at a derm clinic that managed to get me some samples of scar cream. However, I sorta wanted more than that and I figured that since I do have a friendly dermatologist, I could maybe go to her for a prescription of the creams my friend gave me. Problem is -- the scars are obviously self-harm scars. I could maybe lie and say I accidentally cut my arm, but I think given the number of scars and the location, it is clear they are self-inflicted. I'm just wondering if it is a good idea to still go to my dermatologist. I'm not too worried about her telling my dad because they are a few months old, and I weirdly trust her enough to talk about them.... but at the same time, I just feel like... attention-seeking. Like, shouldn't I be trying to hide my scars? So, why would I willingly tell someone about them? Personally, since I have stopped self-harming, I am not too worried about what people will think. I'm not \"open\" about it, but I'm willing to talk about it... but I am a little afraid of 1) people telling my family (only my brother knows) since my dad is very... skeptical about mental health stuff and 2) I don't like talking about it, per se, but it's not something I guess I'm ashamed about -- I almost feel like feeling ashamed will just make me feel overall worse about all of it, ya know? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Is it a bad idea to go to my dermatologist with my self-harm scars? I'm already seeing a therapist and I stopped cutting 3 months ago. My dermatologist is a \"family friend,\" but I personally feel like I can trust her since she has done a lot for me, and I feel like she would be understanding of this sort of thing since she seems to be a great and understanding parent towards her kids.

It also didn't help that I have very weak ligements in my ankles and I have very flat feet. I ended breaking down when I was being constantly badgered by the teacher I hate for walking too slow and holding everyone up (I was at the very end of the group and my teacher, lesson who was also on the trip, told me to take as long as I needed and they'd wait for me). Well I ended up crying and she asked me what was wrong and checked the slip they made us fill out, it wasn't on because it said nothing about a hour hike and me and my mum assumed they'd check schools medical notes that are accessible to all teachers. She said that they didn't and that's what the slips are for (they only said about allergies etc\n...).

I'm kinda surprised they didn't worry that this is a kinda normal thing for me.  It didn't help that everywhere we went was on giant slopes with barely any surface to place our feet.

So...um, it didn't go well. I was already highly self conscious of my scars (even though at the time there were only about two hundred) but after that I quit wearing shorts and t-shirts. That was only two years into my habits. And after that I kind of dismissed even the idea of seeing a therapist, probably because I was expecting them to react in the same way and call me names or something. And that happened a good many times after that.\n\nI don't know, I guess it just stings that there could have been so many chances for me to get help but because of shitty teachers/shitty mental health care in my country, particularly for adolescents/shitty parenting, I've repeatedly been denied those chances. \n\nAnd now it's been six years and it just feels like it's too late to even try and get help, even though logically I know this isn't true. Plus, after the numerous terrible experiences I've had with mental health \"professionals\" (trying to force me to strip and advising my mother to remove my bedroom door--some of their \"tactics to combat her problem\"), social workers (again, trying to force me to strip, insisting on being present when I went to see a counsellor even when I asked them to leave), teachers (just...mucking things up in general, in the same vein as the stuff before but also including repeatedly phoning my mother (who couldn't give a shit if she tried, apart from to yell at me) and making tens of referrals that never came to frutition), and friends and parents (friends who made me promise me to never cut again)----it just feels like it's all a big joke. Like I won't get any help even if I try to. So I haven't.\n\nQuite a lot of my body is covered in scars, specifically that kind that makes the surface of the skin look crinkled because there are hundreds of medium-depth ones piled ontop of each other. So I'm pretty self-conscious of those.\n\nPlus, I'm way too scared of being sectioned. That idea was drilled into my head very thoroughly: that if I so much as hint at having self harmed in the past, never mind the present, I'll be locked up. Which is probably a bloody load of wank, I know.\n\nWhen it got really bad I used to have to try and take care of myself (stupid things like taking sleeping pills to prevent myself from cutting) and I've been able to \"manage\" my addiction for six years successfully without help. But I know that one day that won't work. Similarly with anorexia and some other things. I don't do too well in school because a lot of my mind is taken up with either trying to steer myself away from problems, or trying to figure out the best way to indulge with minimum damage. \n\nThis turned into a rant. Sorry.\n\nSo, I'm not really desperate to seek help at the moment, but it really sucks knowing that if I ever were to in the future, I wouldn't be able to, and that I can't even talk about this with people in my life because I'm too bloody paranoid. Fucks sake. \n\nSorry again for this bloody rant. I had the urge to get it off my chest", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

While describing the incident to my therapist, as I always do, I laughed at myself for being \"safe\" while cutting. I have an altoids container with a small box of new blades, alcohol wipes, triple antibiotic ointment, gauze, and a small roll of bandage tape-- this is my kit I bring with me everywhere to prevent infections and further in injury after I cut, regardless of where I may be. I said, \"It's nearly ridiculous from a logical standpoint for me to \"be safe\" while self harming, it just doesn't make sense because I'm in the act of hurting myself. It's like that question about lethal injection, why sanitize the needle if the person is going to die anyway?\" \n\nAnd it made me wonder about others who SH, and if they also go out of their way to nurse their wounds as if they weren't the ones to put them there in the first place. Why do we take care of ourselves after SHing if the point of SHing is to inflict pain on ourselves? Is it because we only want to inflict damage we can control? Is it only because it's hard to hide if it's messy? \n\nThis is a deeper conversation I'm continuing to pursue with my therapist and hopefully finding an answer can help me overcome this addiction, or at least give me a better understanding of myself. I just needed to vent, I guess. This subreddit community has shown it's nothing but supportive, so I felt comfortable typing this out as my first post ever.

The 5 years was recent until I relapsed a few months ago, maybe about April? maybe early may but my brain is scrambled lately. \n\nBut my question is this: why are my urges and compulsions to SH coming back? I had been clean for so long and didn't even think about it, but ever since I moved out and have been on my own, it pops up almost randomly. Bad stuff happening and I'm anxious? Urges to relapse. Bored and no one's home? Urges to relapse. Sitting blankly at work not busy? Urges to relapse. I'm a little scared and I have no idea to combat this, and they're getting stronger every time. \n\nI think one thing that keeps triggering me the most is how *uneven* everything looks. Not gonna go into detail about where and how necessarily, but it's a noticeable difference across my body and I hate looking at myself.

At track we have to wear these really short shorts and my cuts are on my upper thighs. So we were talking about something and his sentence just fell away. I looked over at him and he looked wide eyed and said \"Do you cut?\"  a thousand thoughts crossed my mind. I thought that this might ruin our friendship, and I really liked him. So I just said \"I used to, but I quit\" but I lied, I was still cutting, but I felt so bad for lying. I hate lying to people, I'm fine with keeping the truth from people, but as soon as I need to actually lie about something, I feel really bad. Then he said something really unexpected, he said \"good job\" and he smiled at me and punched my arm playfully. All I could do was look down. I was so ashamed. \n\nA while later he was talking about how he tends to overthink things and I decided I would tell him because I care about him a lot and I hate lying to him. I told him that I overthink things, then I cut. And then I regretted telling him. I kept apologising and I felt so bad that he had to take on a burden like me. I kept thinking about how he will have to worry about if I will self harm or be safe. I hate it when people worry about me. Then after I kept apologising he told me that he's not mad he's just disappointed. He told me he didn't know how to help me, and then he made me promise never to do it again. I agreed, but I knew I wouldn't be able to keep that promise. It's not that easy, but he didn't understand and I didn't want to talk about it anymore. \n\nLater on he kept checking in on me and asking if I was ok. He told me that he's always there if I needed him and he was really supportive. But he still didn't really understand it. So I cut again, after I promised that I wouldn't, and he saw because of those stupid booty shorts we had to wear. So I explained to him that cutting was an addiction and that I really was trying to quit. \n\nI went through a time where I felt actually happy. The boy I was talking about asked me to be his gf. But I kept having this feeling that I wasn't good enough for him. I feel like a burden to everyone I know. So I didn't cut for 16 days and that was the longest that I've ever not cut for. Then I started cutting again because family issues and being alone too much because summer and shit. Then I went 9 days without cutting and I was pretty proud. This was a couple of days ago, but I completely broke down from all the stress I was going through and I cut myself about 30 times. My house burnt down and I can't move back for 3 months. So I'm homeless and I'm stuck with my family 24/7. We've been living in small hotels. My mom was super stressed and she took it out on me. She screamed at me a lot, and she was super nice and supportive to my sister. It just really hurt, but now she's been more nice to me. I've been trying to act more happy and I told her that I quit self harm. \n\nSo here's my problem, I promise my bf that I'd tell my mom because I wasn't getting better on my own. But the day I was about to tell her was when my house burnt down. I don't want to add more stress to her life because she's already stressed enough. Also, I don't want her to treat me different again. I want her to be happy about me. I don't want to feel ashamed everytime I see her. I just want her to be happy. \n\nIt's just a really bad situation and idk what to do. Should I tell my mom, make my bf happy and get help from a professional? If I do that, I'll waste the little money we have on me and my mom will start screaming at me for all the little things I do. And I'm really scared of going to a professional. I feel like I'm not depressed enough. I feel like I'm faking everything. I really don't want to go to a psych ward because I've just heard the worst stories about there. Or should I keep this a secret and make my mom happy? I won't waste any money and my mom will finally be happy with me. I'll be enough for her, she only have to worry about me. I won't have to stress about going to a doctor appointment. I won't wonder if I'm going to be sent away or anything. I'll know that I can stay here and support my sister or friends if they need me. But my bf will have to stress about me being okay and have to worry about if I relapse. \n\nWhich brings me to my next problem. I didn't tell him that I relapsed because everytime I tell him that I cut, he blames himself. I feel so bad, I don't want to hurt him. He told me that if I ever need him, to call, so I called him before I cut. I was hoping he could talk me down. It was like 3am and I didn't expect him to answer. So I told him I was testing if he'd actually answer if I called him in the middle of the night. I didn't tell him that I actually needed him because I didn't want him to blame himself. When he didn't answer, I completelt broke down and cut around 30 times. Not because he didn't answer, just like all the shit that's been happening. So I don't know if I should tell him or just lie. I want our relationship to be healthy, but I really don't want to hurt him.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Said pool had at least 200 fucking people. I had really recent self harm. But my mom didn't know. She asked if I wanted to swim and I said no. My excuse was that I wasn't feeling well and she said it was fine if I didn't swim. But then, my older brother didn't want to swim for NO fucking reason. He asked if he could sit out on swimming and she said its fine. So, at this point, only my little brother is swimming, but when we're already half way there to the pool, my mom asks if me and my older brother brought our swimsuits. Obviously, I said no, because she gave me and him permission not to swim. But then she fucking freaks out and starts yelling at us for not swimming. Bless her soul. So I'm sitting there. In fetus position. While my mom is fucking screaming at me. Awesome. We still had to come to the pool, though. But I was wearing a jean jacket, which my mom kept telling me to take off, but I couldn't because my cuts. So I sat there. For three hours. Watching everyone else. Having a normal life. And having fun. Because I. Am too fucking stupid. I decided to cut myself before going to the fucking pool. Then, I had to go fishing with them, too. I hated every fucking second of it. But after we get home, shit doesn't stop there. So. It's four in the fucking morning and my mom comes in my room while I'm asleep. She sees my self harm kinda just sticking out of my jacket. She just says what happened? Are you cutting yourself? You must be in so much pain. I was too shocked that she found out to say anything, so I just burried my face in my pillow and didn't respond. She just walked away. Yesterday was the worst day of my fucking life. Also, at the pool, me and my older brother just sat on a shady bench and had a conversation. I told him that I still self harmed and he said that it was really obvious, which made me feel like shit. Then, he gave me some self harm tips. He said to just cut under/on my ribs instead of my arms and legs. Okay. I guess that was helpful but that really didn't make me feel supported or loved. He just told me to keep cutting, but on my ribs? Like, I will. But now I wonder if he really actually cares wether I hurt myself or not. And I know probably like three people are going to see this post. If I get any comments, they'll probably just be those weird overused 'inspirational' quotes about mental illness and self harm that don't help anyone. For example, that one overused quote, \"your skin isn't paper, don't cut it.\" That's not what I need right now and it's not that simple.

This is a perfectly normal feeling to have. When you\u2019re suffering, part of your mind doesn\u2019t want you to get help and it tells you \u201cwell, other people have it worse so...\u201d but it\u2019s important not to listen to that part.\n\nI was someone who thought the same things. At the end of the day, I was hurting myself with a dangerous tool. When your pain reaches the point where you have to hurt yourself to cope, it\u2019s clearly real pain. All self harm is valid. Part of that self harm can be emotional, in the form of comparing and telling yourself your pain isn\u2019t enough.\n\nBut once you start aspiring to cut deeper or hurt yourself more, it just makes everything worse. I would say \u201cI wish I could go deeper\u201d too, but now that I do cut deep it makes me sad seeing people wish their self harm was as bad as mine. The worst part is those feelings don\u2019t go away. It starts with thinking \u201cI haven\u2019t reached styro/fat so I\u2019m not a real cutter\u201d and turns into \u201cI haven\u2019t reached fascia/muscle so I\u2019m not a real cutter\u201d.

I started a new job in April and it's the longest I've ever held a job.  I usually have a mental breakdown, suicide attempt, and am hospitalized for several months.  But I love this job so much and I am wonderful at it.\n\nBut money's tight and I work basically full time.  My fiance (together 7 years) is used to me always being at home, doing all housework, cooking, cleaning, pet care, laundry, etc., and that's REALLY hard working this much and being in recovery from alcoholism.  I don't like to ask him for help because I don't like inconveniencing people, but I really can't do it all anymore.  My job is incredibly vigorous.\n\nWhat happened just now is I ask him to do stuff, he says he will, but like 90% of the time he forgets.  So I meal prepped for us earlier this week to save us time and money.  He told me to go to bed and he'd put it up.  Woke up for work and the food had been sitting out all night.  $40 wasted again.  I ask him to do the dishes since I do all of the cooking...  He does them like 2x a month.\n\nLike I mentioned, I try not to hound him.  He's a really laid back guy, but for some reason this is where communication breaks up for us...  and we've dealt witch much bigger issues previously with ease.  I told him today when he said he spent too much at the grocery store (by the way, in addition to all housework, I buy about 75%+ of the groceries) that if he'd put up for food like I'd asked and he agreed to that we wouldn't have had to get more before I get paid Monday.  I even laughed!  But he immediately tensed up and then said no one wants to do anything when they're nagged.  I'm not a nagger because I don't like to inconvenience him...  as I've said...  twice now?\n\nSo, to speed things up, I got pissed at myself for speaking up and asking for help.  I want to do it all, so it's humbling even if it's well- received.  But he was just not receptive at all.  We're so broke that I ran out of my psych meds on Sunday.  That didn't help.  I cut the fuck out of myself on my arms and legs and hit my dermis in almost every cut.  It's worse than usual for me.\n\nI would love to do everything for everyone.  I try to be the hero.  But I CAN'T.  Between working from 6:45 a.m. - 9:15 p.m., doing alcohol recovery stuff, and household chores...  It's too much.  I think it finally made sense to him when he said he works even more than I do but I said, \"You do, but you still have time for hobbies and to relax every day.  Even on my days off I might have an hour or two.\" I don't even have time to shower most days because I'm cooking and whatnot.  That made it click for him. \n\nOf course, I was covered in blood by then.  I can't believe after not cutting for so long the urge came on so suddenly and strongly.

I\u2019m too much of a pussy to really cut myself; I\u2019m too averse to pain (as I should be!)\n\nEDIT: Now that I\u2019m sober and looking at these cuts that will definitely leave some scars, I regret trying this out. I hope I never have to have the conversation where I explain to someone that I did this on a drunken whim and, no, I\u2019m not suicidal. If anyone who feels like me reads this in the future, I would tell them not to do it and just find something else to do.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

She told me about her own struggles in the past and was overall empathetic with me. \n\nNow, the problem is that, I have grown very fond of this friend, to the point that I have started developing romantic feelings for her. We still remain good friends, but I can really see myself trying to initiate something beyond a friendship with her. \n\nHowever, I'm scared that my past will come back to haunt me. I have been pretty much an open book with her. I've opened up to her about my struggles, I've made myself extremely vulnerable to her. Essentially, she knows me and my struggles and I fear that she might be turned off by the emotional baggage I am carrying and by my 'unhinged' behaviour. I know for a fact that she has her own struggles with mental health, but she's generally pretty reserved and doesn't share her struggles with anyone. \n\nObviously, I can't know for sure before I try, but it pains me to think that I may have missed out on a good person because of my oversharing.

I never thought I\u2019d live past 16, I almost didn\u2019t on a couple occasions. I started cutting when I was in middle school, and progressively got worse as I went into highschool. I never really felt like existed, I was always just kinda there, that it wouldn\u2019t make a difference if I was here or not. The pain came with a sigh of relief and it started to become the only thing I could count on. For awhile no one noticed but the longer it went on the deeper they got and the more noticeable. I hated myself. People at school would bully me and get physical, would embarrass me in front of my class mates and I always just took it. I believed I deserved it. I was in an abusive relationship with a guy who would bash me about my scars and it\u2019s and would tell me how worthless I was. I lost my virginity to him out of the pressure of him not wanting to wait, I was scared to death and when it started I cried and asked him to stop but he didn\u2019t. It became a regular thing and I stopped crying about it. I never enjoyed it, but I took it. And wish I could say I left when he started being physical, instead of punching the walls in front of me it was throwing me against the refrigerator or pinning me down so I couldn\u2019t leave because I didn\u2019t want to have sex. I started to cut deeper and decided I didn\u2019t want to live anymore. I went to therapy was on a million medications and eventually after losing it was baker acted. I spent a couple nights in the hospital having to see the disappointment on my family\u2019s face and the pain I caused. I was drugged a couple days after getting out of the hospital, I ended up in the back of a car for hours and a friend saw me and ended up carrying me home. I felt even more worthless, so I took a nice long bath and downed a bottle of Benadryl and some medications prescribed to me. I blacked out, I don\u2019t know how long and woke up in a mall, looking for a pen on the ground that I never had. I was seeing things, no one took me to the hospital. My mom struggled to cope with this and I don\u2019t remember the days. There\u2019s a gap in my memory and everything was fuzzy. I tore my family apart, it got around the school and everyone knew.

I was doing alright for a few months but apparently healthy coping mechanisms just don't work for me when sh*t hits the fan. \nAnyway, I grabbed the kitchen knife and realised that it isn't sharp enough; being somewhat impatient, I grabbed the sharpener, did a few passes and took it straight to my thigh. Then I've realized that the cut is all grey because of the metal shavings since I stupidly didn't wash the blade before using it. Now I am wondering if I introduced steel shavings to my bloodstream and how dangerous that might be. Does anyone have any advice? I'm probably being paranoid.

The scars are a constant reminder that this body is mine. I made these marks, I can identify with them - they are mine. The feeling of gently opening my skin, the blood slowly dripping out, the little rush you get makes you feel alive for sure. Such a physical, visceral reminder that I'm in this body, I control it, it's me. It's something my mind can't ignore. No amount of thinking can compare to how well it works in bringing me back when I start losing my touch with reality. An instant tether back into the physical world. It makes sense to me now, why I only cut in the places easily seen. It's not just because it's easier (in fact, cutting on my [redacted], I go deeper and have more if an affect with calming myself down) or as much for attention. It's for me. A reminder that I exist. \n\nHope you all don't mind a bit of a rant-y post. That was from a journal entry I just wrote. I woke up at midnight feeling paranoid, tired and out of it. I decided to just write in my journal about how I was feeling, how I felt yesterday and how I dealt with things, you know, usual journal-y stuff. But somehow in my loopy state I was able to finally put it into words, actually figure out *why* I do what I do. \n\nI've understood for a while that it helps me regulate my emotions. It's the only way I've been about to reliably use. But there's always been something else to it, some reason why I do it even when I'm not overwhelmed with emotion.\n\nNow I've finally figured out why, it's something I've struggled to understand ever since I started doing it. In the beginning it seemed pretty simple, just a way to physically feel and express the immense mental pain I was feeling. But that was 3 years ago. I'm a completely different person now, I've gone through so much change and figured so much out about myself and have grown. I'm seeing that my struggles are so much more complex than what I thought I understood before. New problems that I hadn't experienced before.\n\nComing out of my depression is revealing and allowing other issues to surface. Like fuckin emotions. Such a wild ride. No idea how people deal with them in a healthy way lol. \n\nI hope all this shit I'm figuring out about myself continues to help me heal further.\n\n\nSorry about such a long post\ud83d\ude05 but I felt like I just had to really process this.

I would cut in class, go to the bathroom to hide in the breaks to cut. Had my first very poor suicide attempt around that time. That was my life for some years until I went to boarding school, and things were starting to look up, I started being a happy teen, and I was alright for a few years. \n\nThen at 17 I found a boyfriend, an absolute asshole, but I was so desperate to be loved that I would do anything to be with him. Moved away from my hometown, family and friends to be with him. Then he got me into a lot if drinking and drugs. The relationship was so toxic and worsened my already unstable psyche even more, and I started cutting again. When ever there was an argument between us I would threaten to kill myself, and attempting a few times. This went on for 3 years, until I broke up with him, moved back to my hometown and was completely alone, and my depression got real bad. After 2 more suicide attempts I ended up in psychiatric care and got diagnosed with bpd. \n\nI started cutting worse than ever, got into an assisted living place with 24/7 staff for a couple of years, and after a lot of treatment, meds and support I live in my own flat now, and have been 662 days clean from cutting. \n\nI know that is a serious post, but you guys are the nicest people and I kinda wanted to talk to y\u2019all, I really do consider MoS as my friends", "subreddit": "MadeOfStyrofoam"}

We were hanging out and talking and then we sat down and I guess my dress (which I thought was long enough to cover my scars) must have rolled up a bit without me noticing and so he saw. I was talking and I could tell the moment he saw because he just stared at my thigh a little and I was wondering what he was staring at and much to my dismay I noticed that my scars were showing. I pulled down my dress a bit and we continued talking... he didn\u2019t mention anything the rest of the night so I still kind of had the hope that he hadn\u2019t seen anything.\n\nHowever... Fast forward to when I got back home. I was getting ready for bed when I saw that he was calling. I have a huuugeee crush on him so of course  I answered the phone and he asked me how I was doing etc.... then he finally got to the point.. he told me that he had tried to ignore the scars he saw but he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it and wanted to talk to me and make sure that I was OK. He told me that he was here and asked me if I wanted to talk about it, because it seemed like i was self harming. He proceeded to ask me if I had told anyone else about it and I told him no and then he asked me again if I wanted to talk to him about it and let him know what was going on. I was so horrified and scared that I said no. He told me that it\u2019s OK and that he felt like I wasnt telling him anything because I was worried about the way that he would react....I just told him that it was a long story and that I appreciated his concern but I wasn\u2019t ready to talk about it, which I wasn\u2019t. I was scared I would cry and that I would be a burden...\nAfter our call I texted him telling him again I appreciate his concern and that I\u2019m fine and asked if he could do me a huge favor and not mention it to anyone. He said yeah for sure and added that if I ever wanted to talk just let him know. \n\nBut now... a week has passed and I think I\u2019m ready to talk about it with him I guess, but I\u2019m a little embarrassed about bringing it up. TL;DR\u2014I guess my question is... how do I take him up in his offer to talk ? I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m relying on him for emotional support and I also don\u2019t want to be a burden :-( I also don\u2019t want to overwhelm him because this is a huge thing to know and a huge secret to keep for me especially since he\u2019s the only one who knows!", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

My best friend saw my thigh and my arm and asked me about it, and I just said I fell really hard, but she didn't buy it. I ended up telling her about it, and then didn't really say much else. I've been having a really rough week and I've been cutting more than ever. It used to be a couple times a week that I'd cut, and now it's a couple times a day. I'm going to a bonfire at a friend's house, and my best friend and boyfriend are gonna be there, and usually every time I'm gonna see them I wear long sleeves. I told the friend who's hosting the bonfire about the whole hot wax ordeal, and he kind of got how I felt about it. I'm really scared about showing my scars/cuts to them cause I'm not so sure any of them know, but I'm just gonna suck it up and wear short sleeves. I can't wear long sleeves forever, and anyways, the scars/cuts aren't too big or noticeable. I really want to tell them before we do that though, cause I don't want them just seeing cuts for the first time without any warning. Should I tell them that I'm way worse than I was before?

Because if I make one cut and cover it with a band-aid my mom will know I'm still cutting. Because maybe more people will find out, and suddenly I won't be able to pretend to be okay anymore. Because I don't even know the right spot to cut and I'm scared I'll fuck up.\n\nI want to cut on my arm so badly that those reasons just don't seem so important anymore. I want to see the wound open up before my eyes, I want to see the bandage covering it for weeks. I want to see the scar, red and purple and so obvious to what it is.\n\nPart of me even wants others to see it, because I'm so sick of no one caring enough. I'm sick of my bf knowing I cut yet never even asking me if I was okay for weeks before I told him. I'm sick of my mom knowing and not even doing anything about it, not getting me the counselor I was so ready to see. I'm sick of everyone just turning a blind out every time I finally manage to reach out, because its so fucking hard and it never gets me anywhere.\n\nFuck.... I just want to cut up my arm.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

We go to the same school and our classes are pretty close, so we talked a lot. She's really special and brought me nothing but joy when I saw her. As we got into talking more and more, things got more personal and deep. At 4am we were still talking and she mentions how she's had a crush on me since we first met. I tell her I felt the same way, and so our relationship takes a turn for the even better...\n\n...until a week ago. She mentioned how she hasn't felt confident in herself since she was 12 (we're both 17), and that she sometimes cuts herself on her leg. She's been doing well with school, but she failed a hard class last quarter, and after that she scratched \"failure\" into her leg. As glad as I was that she was opening this up to me, I was immediately sick and felt so bad for her. We've both had the fake \"depression\" as teens usually have, but now she's suicidal and hurting herself for real. After that, she lets me know that she hasn't cut herself since we met. Since she's told me that she cuts, I've been telling her over and over again that she is beautiful and not worthless in hopes that she won't feel depressed. I've also asked her to stop cutting as I think it's a terrible addiction over again.\n\nWell today, she was coming back from a overnight camp trip and I finally tell her this morning (bad timing ik) that as much as I love her and think she's beautiful, telling her every time she doesn't feel confident about herself is starting to become repetitive and a bit annoying. I immediately clarify that I have no problem telling her these things about her, but if I keep doing this, then it will start to not mean anything to her since they are only temporally convincing her.\n\nShe tells me that she needs to think for a bit and so we don't text for about 6 hours. After that, we meet up to walk her dog, and she confesses that she cut herself for the first time since we met today after I told her that. I take blame for it, but she assures me that its not my fault and all I've done to her is help her and show kindness. But then she tells me that she can overcome it herself with time and the only way I can help is if I don't ask her to stop cutting anymore. I really want to be there for her and do anything, but I'm afraid she's going to not be able to stop cutting and possibly die. Her family is in debt and doesn't have money for a therapist, and my gf is sure it won't help her anyway. No one knows this about her other than me\n\nWhat can I do? I'm trying to be helpful and remain open if she wants to talk about anything, but I'm super sorry for her and feel like she needs help. But also, I don't want to do anything over the top in case she's right and she does start to feel better about herself soon.\n\nShe tells herself that she's fat and not pretty, but this is obviously very untrue. She's the most beautiful girl I know and I can picture us being married someday. Can anyone give me some advise? I would be in eternal debt to you guys :)", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Not sure why. I just wasn\u2019t interested in cutting after I was done. The odd thing is it wasn\u2019t some come to Jesus look at all of these scars sort of thing.

When my mother walked in my room she got angry at me and told me to go and just eat and that I\u2019m being a lunatic. Is this normal for a parent? Everyone I know that suffers from such has easily gotten therapy by their parents, but I can\u2019t even get my parents to worry. Don\u2019t get me wrong they\u2019re really caring, they just don\u2019t believe I need any help. I really want help though. I\u2019ve been hurting myself for way too many years that I\u2019ve just developed a paraphilia to cope. Sometimes I plan out my suicide and think if my parents would help me by then. I lost all my friends because everyone senses my depression. I don\u2019t have anyone to vent to, but at least I found this place.

I'd like to make this post to give everyone some ideas on things to do before choosing to sh or to replace it in some fashion. Sometimes I would sh out of anger, sadness, stress, anxiety, or plain boredom, so I hope this can help some of you by replacing your urges with something positive. (I apologize if it's not categorized so nicely)\nIMPORTANT NOTE: If you HAVE harmed yourself extremely bad or are considering suicide, PLEASE seek medical help/treatment. These tips focus on taking care of yourself, and therefore your priority in that situation should be much more serious.\nWith that, here are some tips!\n\nFirst, take a few deep breaths. Take a lot actually! Maybe close your eyes, lay down or sit comfortably, and focus on your breath. You can use the box breathing method, counting, or any other method to take full breaths. Whether you're angry, stressed, or tired, this should help relax you and put you in a better state of mind. Do this for as long as you need or want.\n\nThe next step will depend on your situation and emotions. Do whatever you feel you can or need to do to avoid hurting yourself. Things to try:\n\n1. Go to sleep- sometimes all you need is a good night's sleep or a nap. If it's late at night or a good time of day for it, get some rest. No ifs, ands, or buts. This ensures you're taking care of yourself while also resisting harm.\n\n2. Talk to someone- this can be hard, but if you have a good friend, a family member you're close with, or maybe a teacher or counselor, try talking or texting them. If this isn't an option, write! Having a journal to write in about your feelings holding nothing back is really great, and you can keep it on your phone or physically write it. Just getting those emotions out can help calm you or make you feel less alone. And when talking to someone, you don't have to tell them why you're upset, just explain that you've had a bad day and need to talk, whether that be about the issue or just as a distraction. When in doubt, call or text a hotline.\n\n3. Eat/drink something- if you haven't eaten anything in the past few hours, have a snack or even a meal if it's been long enough. Drinking water is also important to do throughout the day, so remember to stay hydrated and eat properly, as not doing so constitutes self harm in some capacity too. Be sure to eat healthy if possible, or give yourself a sweet treat.\n\n4. Clean up- This could mean cleaning your body, such as showering or taking a bubble bath, or cleaning your room if it's messy. Hygiene is really important if you're depressed or anxious, so be sure to stay clean so you can feel good!\n\n5. Exercise- This can range from doing some stretches or yoga in your room to going swimming to walking your neighborhood block. Whatever it is, getting moving or being out in nature can help clear your head and put you in a better space.\n\nThese next ones are more fun and silly, but if you can't focus on other things and need to distract, these can be pretty helpful and fun. Some might not apply to everyone, but I encourage you to use them as small goals or short activities for however many you can or wish. Of course, please do not let these take away from other tasks like work and school, but use them as a form of self love/care. \n\n6. Draw/color pictures\n7. Write a story/poem \n8. Practice an instrument(or learn a new one!)\n9. Read a book\n10. Practice a language\n11. Sing/dance/listen to your favorite music\n12. Study something you've been curious about (flowers, cars, history, etc.)\n13. Do crafts! (Origami, making cardboard cutouts, knitting, etc.)\n14. Go out somewhere (mall, grocery store, library, etc.)\n15. Gardening\n16. Plan your ultimate vacation/bucket list\n17. Have a fashion show to yourself and try on all your clothes. Make fun outfits!\n18. Schedule time with friends to go out together\n19. Reorganize your room/closet/storage room etc. \n20. Watch your favorite movie/show/videos\n21. Spa day- either out at one or at home! Pamper yourself.\n22. Volunteer at a charity or event(a bit more difficult)\n23. Take pictures of yourself, nature, etc.\n\nThese are the ones I could think of, some of which I have done. They vary in difficulty and specificity, but I hope some of them can help you! If you have something you do, let us know! Let's all fight together \u2661 stay strong everyone!", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I have before, but I just feel different than them. It might sound weird, but I like to look at self harm scars and cuts. It is so terribly triggering but I fucking do it anyways. If I see someone in public, I try my best not to look because I understand how embarrassing and shameful it can be when someone stares at your scars, but for some reason I always find myself looking. I don\u2019t know why, I know its weird. It soothes me, I think. I think I just like to have the reassurance that I\u2019m not the only person who does it? I really don\u2019t know, though. My boyfriend knows that I do it, but he doesn\u2019t understand why. I\u2019ve told him that I literally can\u2019t stop and I\u2019m thankful that he doesn\u2019t get mad anymore. But I wish I knew why I couldn\u2019t stop. My life could be perfect and I\u2019d still cut. None of my friends understand why I literally can\u2019t. fucking. stop. It\u2019s like an impulse. An addiction, even. Whatever, it\u2019s annoying. Does anyone else have friends who get mad at you when you do it? Like, dude, that doesn\u2019t help! In all fucking honesty, it makes me feel worse, and then I just go home and do it again! But I\u2019d never tell them that, because they never do anything wrong and I\u2019m the only stupid bitch allowed to fuck things up. God forbid they make me upset, its always just me overreacting isn\u2019t it?\n\nAnyway, I ranted because like I mentioned earlier, I don\u2019t talk to anyone about it. I don\u2019t have any friends (anymore) that do it, and even when I did I didn\u2019t like talking about it. I feel like they just judge me, even though I know it\u2019s not the case. It just feels like a personal thing to me. So I ranted to this reddit because I know absolutely no one on here and none of my friends use reddit so I\u2019m not worried about it at all and sometimes ranting to strangers feels better than telling my friends.

Most of them aren\u2019t very big and have faded a lot by now anyways, but my burn scars are weirdly shaped so they\u2019re a bit more noticeable. These are the ones she asked about.\n\nWe\u2019ve been friends for almost 4 years now. I\u2019ll call her Sally. She\u2019s probably the closest friend I\u2019ve ever had. I\u2019ve just always avoided this conversation. Not because I\u2019m embarrassed or ashamed, but mostly because I worry people will pity me or try to get me help. (I\u2019m not running from help, I\u2019m currently in therapy, i just don\u2019t want to make it others\u2019 business). \n\nAnyways, Sally asked what they were and I said they\u2019re burns and that I did them to myself. How she replied was seriously just a huge relief because she wasn\u2019t shocked, she didn\u2019t ask if i still do it, she didn\u2019t say sorry or even direct the conversation towards me at all. Instead Sally said she knew a girl in high school who burned herself with her curling iron. This girl wasn\u2019t even Sally\u2019s friend or anything, but Sally gave the girl her number and told her to call her next time she felt like burning herself. Sally told me she actually received quite a few phone calls from this girl. Some days Sally was able to talk her out of it and sometimes not. Whether she did or didn\u2019t, they never talked about her self-harming at school or even in person. They didn\u2019t even actually talk much at school anyways. It was strictly spoken of in their \u201cphone call therapy sessions\u201d. Kind of don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell. \n\nFor some reason, I think that sort of relationship is so cool. And it\u2019s comforting that my best friend already had a pretty intimate second hand experience with sh. \n\nI told her about how when my friend group in high school found out I was suicidal and self-harming, they basically shut me out. I think they were just scared and didn\u2019t know how to handle that. I\u2019ve never blamed them. \n\nBut I think it\u2019s just nice to know that there are people who handle this whole sh situation well.

I've had some nights where I really really struggle to not grab my blade. Tonight was one of those nights. I was literally preparing to cut when at the last moment I decided to reach out to a hotline, which I rarely do. I was actually able to overcome my urges and can happily say I didn't cut myself tonight! It's always been nearly impossible for me to ignore an urge, but I'm getting there! This is HUGE to me!

I\u2019m sitting on my porch listening to the rain. All I can think about is how I wish I could express my emotions. Oh how I wish I could come to terms with how I\u2019m feeling at this exact moment. I\u2019ve had a dark cloud follow me for quite some time now. For years actually. I\u2019m in my late 20s like the majority of my friends. I have a bachelor degree, an okay job, live on my own, and have the best friends and family i can ask for. But yet each time I leave my apartment, or work, or from a friends or family members house... all I can feel is sadness. I\u2019m so sad and so alone. All the time. Yet I can\u2019t cry. I can\u2019t even remember the last time I cried. I\u2019m not dating, but I know that\u2019s what every 20 something year old is doing at this point in their life. \u201cYour 20s is the time for you to find what you are looking for in a lifetime partner\u201d, they say. But I have no desire to. Why would I? Im so good at being alone. I\u2019ve always been. I fear something is wrong with me. \u201cYou can\u2019t love someone else until you learn to love yourself\u201d they say. But what if I hate myself? Both internally and externally? I\u2019ve always been a motivated, and hard working person. But nowadays I\u2019m just so tired. And I\u2019m so exhausted. I am constantly with my family, or hanging out with my friends... the people who mean everything to me.... to keep myself occupied. But sometimes when I leave to come home, i have to pull over. I have to or else I\u2019d drive my car over a railing, or onto oncoming traffic on purpose. I have to compose myself and collect my thoughts before continuing on my way home for the night. Putting an end to it all has been in the back of my mind for quite sometime. For years now. \n\nI\u2019ve thought about what ways would hurt the least. I\u2019ve thought about ways that would make it look like an accident. But honestly I don\u2019t think I have the balls to do it. Yet I don\u2019t know what it is I\u2019m holding on to either. \u201cIt\u2019ll get better\u201d, I keep telling myself. But I\u2019ve been waiting for it to get better for around 14 years now. My life doesn\u2019t suck. I have so much to offer. I know all this. How can you be surrounded by such wonderful people all the time..but yet feel so alone. Completely isolated. Trapped and in a zombie like state the moment I\u2019m by myself. I can\u2019t even wrap my head around what it is I\u2019m exactly feeling. All I know, is that I\u2019m just here. I\u2019m just existing. I\u2019m still searching for my purpose. Yet getting weaker by the day. I have no words to describe how it feels to be alone like I am. I always wonder how others would end up today, If they endured what I have. Would they be as strong as I am to keeping going? I sit in silence for hours upon hours when I\u2019m alone in my apartment, and no one knows. It\u2019s my secret, and no one else\u2019s. I like the silence.\n\n\n\nPlease remember that the friend or family member who is always the shoulder to cry on....the person who is constantly listening and giving advice.... the person that is constantly joking and making everyone laugh....the person who always tends to bring people together...the person to never talk about their own genuine feelings....may be the person who needs those actions reciprocated the most. The saying \u201ccheck on the happy people\u201d, is so real. Those \u201chappy people\u201d are probably the ones posting their thoughts anonymously online.\n\nThere is an emptiness and hollowness that is too embarrassing to expose. Some can\u2019t see that side. We are too busy fixing others problems and lifting others up, to help bring ourselves out of the pits of darkness we are stuck in. Or to ask for help. You just wouldn\u2019t be able to comprehend. \n\n\nIf for some reason I don\u2019t wake tomorrow....Please know i loved as hard as I could, and fought as long and hard as I could. I just need rest. I just need peace. I just don\u2019t want it to hurt.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I'm 22 now, haven't cut for a month but I really might today. I had an interview with a tech company scheduled for 3pm Eastern Time, 2pm my time. I didn't notice the Eastern Time in the email and missed my phone telling me when the interview was scheduled in my time, so I missed the interview. I'm rescheduled for tomorrow so I don't think I should be upset, but I just don't know how I can be so fucking stupid sometimes. Such a small detail and so many ways/opportunities to realize my mistake, but I missed every one of them. I really fucking hate myself. I've been trying to make a conscious effort to stop cutting, rather than just not cutting because things weren't \"bad enough.\" I guess this is the test of that decision and I don't think I'm up to the challenge. I don't even know if I was really clean from self harm though since I still regularly punch my legs while listening to aggressive music to the point where they're covered in bruises. I don't know if I'm strong enough to go without cutting for any meaningful amount of time. I don't know if it's worth the struggle, if I'm worth the effort, or whether I'm even capable of moving past it and learning better coping strategies. It serves so many purposes for me and it does them fairly reliably. Most often, it's just a reset for when I've been burying feelings and problems and it's a way to release so I can start over. I guess that doesn't have a lot of longevity but maybe that's the point. This mentality of intense self-loathing has always been with me since I was at least 4 years old, and I've always been hurting myself emotionally, so I feel like even if I stop cutting, I'll never be able to stop hating myself and that mentality will always be with me, so it doesn't matter. I don't even know what I'm trying to do with this post anymore, I guess just vent and delay myself in the hopes that the emotions die down a bit so I can think more rationally, but I tend to hold on to these feelings since they're a prime opportunity to purge emotions.

I'm terrified of my parents finding out because I'm scared they'll feel like they've failed me. I'm scared they'll yell, scream, cry or just look at me with disappointment. I think disappointment is the scariest one. I wanna stop self-harming and get better, but no one ever told me it's like a gateway drug. I also feel guilty about the fact that I just wanna get worse because I feel like my problems still aren't enough compared to others. I know everyone's issues are valid but I just feel I'm overreacting over mine. \n\nI feel like I'm in a cycle. I realized this cycle in 3rd grade and had an existential crisis over it and basically became a nihilist before I even knew what it was. People always told me that time heals, but I just want to stop time altogether. I wanna go back before the abuse happened and remember what it was like to just breathe. I guess I just became so desperate to break this cycle that I needed some sense of control, even if it meant my own harm.  \n\nYou're probably wondering what this cycle is? It's the cycle of seeing your potential before falling into a hole. It's like each year this hole gets deeper and deeper where it becomes harder to see where to look. I've never had anyone to look up to, not even my parents. Don't get me wrong, I love them but they're just not the people I wanna be. I used to have a special place to go to, the place where I got my clarity. Every time the abuse would happen, I would go the swings and swing for hours. It never solved the problem but it felt like the only place where I belonged. I've been doing it since I was 5. The swings are gone now and I'm trapped in my room with only myself. It becomes violent sometimes. I hate how the violence is now my special place.\n\nIf I do stop cutting, get better, find good people and feel accepted, I wonder if that's when I finally get my happiness. My scars don't define me but they say so much about my pain. When I get out this hole, I want a life where I can just breathe without being suffocated under the weight of never having what I needed as a little kid. I know I'm gonna be the happiest when I'm alone in my room without the terrible thoughts coming in. I know I'm gonna be the happiest when I can look people in the eyes and not ever feel ashamed of who I am as a person. I believe we can all get there, right? I might barely be able to see the sun in this hole, but I just know it's still there.\n\nI'm going into 8th grade this year and I know there will be questions. I hope I'll able to answer with confidence, even if it's sprinkled with a bit of bullshit. I'm gonna try to tell my parents before the summer ends so I can get therapy and not grow worse during the school year.\n\nI'm sorry if this sounded cliche and dumb rambling. I also really hope this isn't against the rules because I just poured my heart out into this post. And I'm sorry for any grammar errors!\n\n-Red", "subreddit": "selfharm"}
{"post_id": "cep0od", "created_utc": 1563432794, "title": "I hope you all heal", "author": "vixowoxiv", "self_text": "I started self harming at age 10. I think it started with cuts, escalated into putting cigarettes out on my skin, to needing wounds stitched shut, and eventually self mutilation that endangered my life. It was a very dark addiction that stemmed from internal pain and trauma. \n\nAt age 17, one of the closest friends I've had in my entire life died abruptly from gruesome bodily injuries. He was 16 years old. I sensed that his spirit would have given anything to have his body back, unharmed, unwounded, and heart still beating. I also knew that as much as I loved him and wanted him to be safe, he would have wanted the same thing for me. \n\nAfter that I stopped cutting myself. It suddenly seemed wrong to purposely mutilate my flesh; the very thing that my beloved friend had horrifically destroyed and lethally taken from him against his will. The \"pain\" and \"relief\" of self harm became trivial. Whatever suffering I had inside me could not be freed through bloody wounds. Suffering lives not within the sacred body, but within the soul. \n\nFor 11 years I abstained from self harm. I have abused myself in other ways and struggled with other addictive behaviors, but also sought healing and karmic resolution. I expected not to intentionally inflict a wound on myself ever again. \n\nFor 18 years I have carried scars of humiliation, shame, and regret. I couldn't cover my scars forever. It's hard to be judged by people for something you can't change, but you know you did to yourself. People sometimes assume that I was in some sort of accident and had surgery for bone fractures, or a skin graft. Some people know better than that. \n\nOn June 10th, 2019 I sliced myself up during an intense CPTSD flashback / psychotic breakdown. I was reliving an episode of self harm in a trance-like state. I think my actions were the result of unresolved trauma, soul loss, and fear. At times I have moved onwards in life without retrieving every last shattered broken piece of my injured soul. \n\nI hope you all can heal. I hope whatever parts of you that are lost or hurting can be retrieved and whole again. You CAN overcome the addiction and be free from self harm, like I was for 11 years. If you mess up, don't hate yourself for it. Healing is a journey and it takes time.  Don't lose yourself in fresh wounds or old scars. If you want to hurt yourself, please know that there is actually nothing you deserve more than to heal. \n\nX \nSigned with love from someone who cares", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I don\u2019t really expect people to read it, I just need to take this of my chest.\nI\u2019ve never been much of a \u201cphysical self-harmer\u201d, I like to torture myself psychologically, and I\u2019m working on it. But every time I enter a crisis I drink way too much, mix drinks with my anxiety and depression meds and make almost deadly cocktails. Last November I had to be taken to the hospital for such an episode, I was so ashamed. \nI came out of a depression crisis about 3 weeks ago and I thought I was better, I had only isolated myself and ate a ton, but it\u2019s been months I don\u2019t drink myself into a coma. But last week, I went to a huge wedding, fancy food, fancy dresses, open bar... \nAt some point I remember downing champagne and Moscow Mules as if they were tequila shots, after that, my only reliable memory is waking up in the hospital.\nI have some flashes of that night, but most of it is what people told me. \nI felt so fucking guilty I had drank that much I took a glass to bathroom, crushed it and cut my leg and my left arm. My uncle had to carry me to a car, where I threw up all over and take me home. I was passed out. My mom would have to take to a hospital, but she was so dosed up on her sleeping meds and couldn\u2019t, so my dad did. \u201cOk, whats the problem with that?\u201d My dad is on house arrest and shouldn\u2019t leave home btwn 22h and 6h. But he did. He did it for me. Him, my aunt and my uncle took me to the hospital, and he slept there with me, his ankle monitor beeping, until I woke up and we went home. \nHe sent a petition to justify his whereabouts and he has a good lawyer, nevertheless,I put him in so much trouble and I\u2019m so fucking ashamed I look at my relatives. \nSo... I decided I\u2019ll stop drinking., at least for a while. Wish me luck.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

While I have never disclosed my mental illness or the fact that I was suicidal and an active cutter about four months before I got the job, they have been accommodating in giving me the days off I need for my therapy and psychiatry appointments - which I just call doctor\u2019s appointments.\n\nWhen I first started, I opted for the long served uniform shirt option to cover up my scars. Most of them have faded enough that you wouldn\u2019t notice just glancing at my arm, but I have about four or five that are incredibly prominent. My work will be switching to a short sleeved uniform shirt in a bit and I am starting to have some anxiety about it. While I roll up my sleeves sometimes, I keep them long enough that nobody can see my arms completely. \n\nI feel like most of my coworkers will be respectful but I have one coworker that is pretty immature and doesn\u2019t seem to understand common curtesy or respect of personal space. She\u2019s pretty known for this. I have a gut feeling that if anyone will outright ask about my scars, it will be her as she doesn\u2019t really like me and loves to readily point out my flaws. I have been trying to come up with explanations other than \u201cnone of your business\u201d because she has a tendency not to drop things even if you tell her to stop. Any suggestions?  \n\nSide note, I\u2019m also very anxious of having such an blatant sign that I struggle with mental illness. I always wear long sleeves during job interviews because I\u2019m scared it would interfere of getting a job and I\u2019ve always had a secret fear that a customer might complain about my scars.

Im just really worried that he\u2019ll think of me differently and like break up with me or something because its already been stressful enough on him to be with another guy. I dont want things to become too much. I was with someone that was codependent for about 5 or so months and im terrified that ive become like her. She had the same fear when we first got together and im worried that people just become codependent when theyre with someone with those issues or with someone that abuses you in anyway. She had so many issues, which wasnt her fault at all, but i found myself always worrying for her life and always having to be there and if i didnt pick up the phone or text her 24/7 it was literally the difference between her cutting herself or worse and i know for a fact that after being with her im not the same, i dont think i will be for a while, and i know i should express all this to my boyfriend, but i dont know how. I was thinking about writing him a letter, or writing this as notes and then calling him, but is that too insincere? Would it be better to tell him all this in person? Hes the kind of guy that doesnt really talk about his emotions super openly (thats part of what i like about him) but i think that deep down he would be willing to, i think he might have an anxiety issue too, but how the hell do i talk about all this with him?? Is it too soon to tell him? Weve only been together for like a month, but i feel like i should still disclose all this. I really love this guy, and I literally wouldnt be alive right now if he hadnt been there, he doesnt even know that he saved a life this summer, how do i tell him that without making him uncomfortable or like guilt tripping him if he doesnt really like me like she did to me?

For information, I'm 18 and they are 17, and I know they've been self-harming for a few years now due to a plethora of reasons and a really unlucky childhood which has led to them being depressed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been doing my best to support them, and I've researched quite a bit to see what the best way to respond to them self-harming is, and I'd like to think I've been doing quite well, and so have they, seeing as they've only self-harmed a couple of times since we've been together, which is a huge upgrade from before, so I do hope I can offer them some stability and support in their life, and they are going to therapy, so hopefully things will continue to get better :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have however really struggled with some things they occasionally tell me when they're not feeling well, and I'd love to hear what this subreddit thinks I should tell my SO to help them out. \n\nSo it's happened a few times so far that my SO would tell me self-harming is the only solution, and that it actually helps. When they're feeling like this, nothing I say matters, and I don't know how to mention the downsides of self-harm without making it feel like there's anything wrong with the scars? Like obviously I think they're still beautiful with or without the scars, but the fewer the better right? I just don't know how to tell them that self-harm is not a good solution without somehow making them think that the scars that they already have are in any way shape or form ugly. The best I could do when my SO started telling me self-harming was good as if it were a rational logical decision to make was to distract them and get their mind off of thoughts of self-harm until they felt a  little bit better and got over the initial wave of urge to self-harm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut what else can I say? When they're feeling like this, what's the best way for me to tell them self-harm isn't a good solution, without implying that the scar they currently have are wrong? (I find this really hard to phrase, I just mean that I can't say: \"self-harming isn't a good solution because it is only a temporary relief with scars that will stay forever which isn't worth it\" because 1. duh, they know the side effects of self-harm and I don't need to explain that to them and 2. they're insecure about their current scars but I want them to know there's nothing wrong with them and that I will always think that my SO is beautiful, so saying this is a no go.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright sorry for the long post and the rambling, English isn't my main language and I'm not particularly good at keeping things concise ahah. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance for any advice :)", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

The last couple of years have been interesting to say the least. I've been strugling to find a purpose in life. To find a goal or something that makes me happy or at least keep me going.\n\n4 years ago I stopped going out. For no fucking reasson at all. Friends would call and i would refuse. I lost intrest. Literally locked myself in. That was around the time i started to think about the future, about my future and what I want to do with myself\n\n3 years ago I met a girl who I wanted to spend my life with. Thought i found my purpose. Problem was, the people around us did not want us together. Different religion and all that, my parents were ready to cut ties with me. She got scared for some reasson and left. \n\n2 years ago i started drinking a lot. Lost 4 jobs within a year. Had 2 car accidents, none life threatening. Stopped drinking about 8 months in clean since november 2017.\nWas feeling down a lot. Became not agressive but easily irritated amd people started to notice since I am usually a calm and to-my-self kind of guy. Replaced alcohol with energy drinks and cigarettes. My diet got fucked lost 17kg in about 4 months. Now imagine a 21 year old with 54kg and 176 cm height. I was and stilll am a walking skeleton.\n\n1 year ago was when i lost hope in myself. Started thinking about suicide and how i am nothing but a burden to everyone around me. 6 months ago when i wanted to shave myself (i got one of those things that barbers use idk the word in english) something pushed me to just make a cut on myself. At first I was scared. Then excited. And lastly i felt empty. I just kept telling myself wtf have I done.\n\nIt did not hurt me, i just felt dissapointed in myself and how i did not seek help as soon aa the first thought of suicide came. \n\nBut i kept doing it.not often. Exactly 18 cuts in 6 months. \n\nA woman i know noticed i been stressed out and caught up in my thoughts a lot and ahe started to ask questions. I did not tell her anything. I dont know why.\n\nI felt scared when she noticed.\nI still am afraid. \n\nWhile writing this i felt the urge to delete all of it and not even share it with random strangers. Thats how scared I am.\nI am scared to talk to people. I am scared to ne alone. I am terrified of the possibility of being alone for the rest of my life.\n\nPlease tell me what to do. I dont want to fall into it too deep.\n\nThats the short version. \nThere were a lot of other things that pushed me here but typing it all down would take time.\n\nTo recap\nI need help.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

{"post_id": "cg5b2r", "created_utc": 1563749796, "title": "Addiction Sucks", "author": "the_lynx2", "self_text": "Hey everyone, I'm very new here (just found this subreddit) and I wanted to share some of my experience. I would be interested to hear if anyone else has had a similar or vastly different experiences.\n\nI am currently 23 years old. I cut for the first time when I was 14 and my mum found out very quickly which made me stop for a while. I had some more flare ups when I was 16. Since then I have not cut for 7 years.\n\nI wont claim to be completely free from self harm during that period. I have beaten my head against desks and punched my fist through a wall. However I dont fully count these incidents, I dont know why but it's different when it's a cut. Its sharper and it tastes like ice. But I can forgive myself for these slip ups.\n\nWhat I didn't realise and what nobody told me is that self harm is incredibly addictive and that an addiction stays with you. I may not have cut for 7 years but I want to nearly every day.\n\nIf you're struggling or dont know how to start getting better then I dont want this to discourage or depress you. I am telling you what I wish I was told. Too many people will tell you \"it gets better\" or other platitudes. The shitty truth is that only you can dig yourself out of this hole. Outside help is fantastic and can facilitate a recovery but it comes from you.\n\nI eventually managed to stop myself from cutting with a promise. I was actually inspired by a decidely average pop song by the wanted. It's called \"all time low\". The premise is a guy asking how you can ever climb up from your lowest point. I told myself that I would never be as low as I had been if I could make sure I was safe in my own head and wouldn't hurt myself. It hasn't always worked but I have had something to hold onto in my darkest times.\n\nI realise this is a very rambling post and I dont claim to be anywhere close to done in terms of recovery. But I do want to summarise some important lessons I've learnt along this journey.\n\n1. Forgive yourself for when you relapse or 'let yourself down'. No one else can do it. It's hard but if you hold onto that hate and resentment it just makes more so you cut again. Break the cycle.\n\n2. Cry. Cry when you're sad. If you're a bloke like me this might be especially hard. Crying is not a sign of weakness. It's a natural process you're body uses to release stress. Plus the endorphin rush you get afterwards isn't half bad.\n\n3. Talk to someone about it. Once you have said things out loud, even to yourself it becomes less of a huge deal.\n\n4. No medical professional should yell at you or tell you off if you turn up in the emergency room with self inflicted injuries. You may have to speak to a mental health specialist (at least in the UK that has been my experience) but they will mostly be checking to make sure you are safe to leave after treatment. If you're lucky you may even get a referral out of it. (Sorry but I cant account for your parents, guardians or friends yelling at you. Try to remember they do it because they care and they are scared.)\n\n5. My final and most important piece of advice which I have learned through painful experience is that anyone with a history of self harm should be incredibly careful with drugs. I drank and smoked weed as a teenager and I had a fun time. Eventually I stopped enjoying alcohol as much, and then it started to really upset me and cause some horrific mental health flare ups. It was around this time that I realised being high would suppress my urge to cut.\nIf I knew then what I know now I would have run. People (particularly stoners) will tell you that weed isn't physically addictive and therefore you'll be fine. I didn't realise that you still get withdrawal symptoms from a psychological addiction. The point of this is that if you are a person with multiple addictions then withdrawing from one will cause the other to be amplified massively.\nI'm not going to tell you what to take or how to treat yourself, I respect you more than that, but I will say that curling up in a ball under your bed and holding your own hands still to prevent them from acting on thier because you've run out of weed and your dealer isn't answering his texts is not a place you want to end up.\n\nI hope this isn't too bleak. I do genuinely feel optimistic about the future about 50% of the time. \n\nI just wanted to let you all know. I'm still here 9 years on and 7 years clean. It's hard but I'm surviving.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

{"post_id": "cg8wge", "created_utc": 1563771745, "title": "Self-harmed for the first time in a year and half, and just need to vent", "author": "three2em", "self_text": "I'm going to go ahead and just say this may be possibly triggering, so trigger warning.\n\nI'm in my earlier 30s, man, been consciously self-harming since I was a teenager, though on some level I've been doing it as long as I can remember. Getting older has helped in that I've learned better coping mechanisms and have a better sense that things will get better. Additionally, being an adult means I'm more aware of the negative affects treating my body recklessly has. Having people employed under me that I have to manage completely changed how I relate to my scars and what they mean to me. Dating as an adult has changed how I relate to my scars, and I have to accept that a lot of people have a hard time seeing past my disfigured skin.\n\nI mostly can handle all this. And it is a great deterrent from self-harming more often. A few months back I went to the dentist for a cleaning. It was hot outside, so I wore a revealing t-shirt, and the hygienist asked about my scars, and while I've learned through experience to calmly say that I don't like to talk about it, the hygienist acted very awkward, and I felt terrible that I made her feel awkward and I felt terrible that my body causes discomfort for other people.\n\nSummer is always a stressful time. On the one hand, I know that I should be going out, I should be having fun, and yet I always isolate myself. It also mean wearing revealing clothing. I work on a campus, and I learned long ago, when I was in college myself, that I have a weird sensitivity to spaces that I know should be teeming with people but have very few people. So working on a campus during summer, when most students are away, brings me down. My supervisor, who is the only person at my job that I have any real kind of social interaction with, has been on a long vacation, so going to work has meant sitting in an office all day talking to no one. And I'm an introvert, a part of me loves that, but it has been taxing too. I also started listening to this musician that makes absolutely beautiful music, but it is very triggering. Her lyrics deal with issues of domestic abuse and violence in a very raw style.\n\nAll of this added up to getting drunk and cutting myself the other night. Thankfully I had no razors, but I had an old butcher's knife that was dull enough to not cause any cuts deep enough to require months to heal, but sharp enough to cause a lot of pain. I chose a part of my body that could easily be hidden, and did the exact same ritual that I've done since I was in high school. It did exactly what I wanted, and maybe the scariest thing to me is that I don't have any regrets.\n\nThere is a journal that I've had since I was 16 when I started meticulously tracking my self-harming. I keep track of how many cuts, and at some point when episodes became less frequent, I started tracking the dates of when I self-harmed. This probably started after a 4 year stint of not self-harming. I say all this because when I went to write down the date of this most recent episode, it was the exact same date as two years ago, which gave me pause. Like I said, working on a campus during summertime brings me down, but I also think that my body is aware in July that the days are getting shorter, and that brings me down too. It just really shocked me that the dates lined up perfectly.\n\nI know this post is long. I'm posting because I want to \"publicly\" talk about all this, but I don't talk to friends about self-harm because I don't want to come off as manipulative. Being in my earlier 30s, and knowing that I've been hurting my body since I was a child to cope, means that this will probably be a life long issue for me. It certainly limits me. I just hate my body. I hate my existence. I want to no longer exist, but I have a deep fear of going to hell if I commit suicide, and for my family and the few friends I have left, I can't bring myself to hurt them that way. I've always been a lost soul forced into a body that I hate and that I don't understand, and yet it is the one that I have and I have to make due.\n\nThanks for reading all of this. I'm not active in this sub because I don't have any advice to offer other people, but as people that use self-harm to cope, the part of me that recognizes that there is probably more that we all have in common than don't loves you all. Thanks again and take care of yourselves. You're worth it.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

N is the type of girl who is very optimistic despite having a lot of problems but she isn't the type to do SH since her coping mechanism when it comes to her problems are drawing and writing stories.\n\nI used to tell her my problems/my tendecy to cut myself and she keeps telling me to \"not do it anymore\" since it's \"bad\". A few weeks ago, I noticed that she had cuts on her wrist but I didn't open it up, thinking that she isn't ready to talk about it but I felt hurt?? I perceived her as the person who thinks that it's not good to do SH even if she has a lot of problems.  But I just continued observing her and her actions.\n\nThere were 4 things that I had noticed: 1.) She cuts herself DURING classes despite there are a lot of people around her; 2.) Everytime she scratches her head or touch her hair, she would make sure that her wrist would face the person in front of her, showing her cuts; 3.) When she gives something to someone, she would face her cuts upwards; and 4.) She would pick at the scabs in public.\n\nI decided to confront her about this since I had this bad feeling in my chest and she just shrugged me off?? and we didn't talk to each other for awhile. Then here comes another friend of mine (let's call her M), who also SHs, and she told me that she talked to N about her \" cuts\". M asked N if she really was serious about doing SH or if she was just doing it to get attention and N replied with \"It's nothing.\"\n\nAfter that, me and M confronted her once more (yesterday, Sunday) and I asked why she was doing it and this time, this time she responded with \"I just wanted to try it...for fun.\" And I really, REALLY felt hurt. Not only me, but also M. We then cut our relationship with her on the spot. Idk if what we did was right but it was like a slap to our faces. I feel like I'm floating in air right now.

Additionally, if you know of any similar apps that already exist that you're using I'd love to hear about them. This app would allow you to register and select your condition(s), anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, ocd, etc... When you're having a really tough time and want to harm, you can go on the app and it will connect you one on one in a chat with a few different people (anonymous) that also suffer from your same condition(s) so you can explain what you're going through and they can help you through it. My passion for this stems from being able to help others with mental illness when they are suffering and also to give others an easy way to connect with someone with their same condition.

I made my bed and now I should lie in it.\n\nI\u2019d been wanting to do a bad one on my arm for a while, it was so tempting.  Yesterday I was feeling so bad and I just went for it, 30 seconds culminating in a lifelong mistake.  I won\u2019t lie though, I loved every second of it.  I love the implication of it being permanent, I loved feeling warm blood just gush out, and it was so so so much better on my arm.  I want to do it again and again it felt so good.  I feel uncomfortable with my family seeing it but outside of them I don\u2019t give a fuck who sees it.  My coworkers were asking about the one I did yesterday and I just smiled and said my dog did it.  But it\u2019s obvious what it is.

My entire life I've been increasingly susceptible to stress and anxiety. The smallest of issues or problems cause me the most intense reactions. I used to think cutting was such an odd way to deal with pain. My sister did it for about a year and I always thought I would never do it to myself.\n\nRecently my friend has been talking a lot about suicide. I've spent hours sitting there on my phone and trying to prevent anything bad from happening. So far I think I am successful, as she is more positive (but still a lot of negative thoughts). I've never had to deal with death before in my life, and she is as close as I think I've been to losing someone I love.\n\nI finally couldn't take the stress anymore. I had no outlet. I had been using scissors to cut into some plastic absentmindedly, and without really thinking of it, I started cutting with the plastic. This quickly went from jagged plastic to a knife, where I leave surface cuts on my skin.\n\nIts an odd sensation, feeling the burn of a cut, but at the same time feeling... satisfied? I'm worried about it, but at the same time don't really think much about it. I actually spent $20 at a hardware store on a duct knife, really sharp, after my first night of cutting, and that's what I use now.\n\nI have no intention of taking it further then surface scratches and the occasional bleeder. I am not suicidal and I think I would be better off living with a shit ton of stress and anxiety then ending it forever. However, I never even really thought about cutting myself before I just started doing it, and that is kind of scary.\n\nIs it wrong for me to cut?

If that isn't enough, it's fine, you can delete my post. No hard feelings.\n\nAnyways, back on track. I feel like this is a necessary evil. I've been relying on my friends to carry my pain for too long now. If I'm the only one hurting, then it's for the better. Just happens to be physical alongside mental this time. But more importantly, the physical pain helps me clear my mind. I've always been begging to find a physical release, mainly to be able to cry again. Well, after about half a decade of trying and failing that, this is what I've got. Scratching and poking to focus and disperse all the emotion. It's better than feeling like I'm gonna explode if I don't talk to someone every single night.\n\nBut, there's a catch. One of my closest friends was manipulated by someone who used self harm to get what they wanted. I knew this before I started (a few weeks ago), and I feel like an asshole for it. If I ever do tell them, it could bring up bad memories when they've already got a lot on their plate.

Since I cut a months ago I have scars everywhere from wrist to elbow. I mean on the in- and outside. Everywhere. I don\u2019t know what to do. The last time she saw scars (the ones that barely bleed and are really small) she burst out into tears. My scars are bigger and deeper now and I don\u2019t know how she would react to that. \nShould I just hide the shirt and say I lost it? What should I do???? Btw. I haven\u2019t cut again since", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

It feels comforting despite the obvious fact that it is alway placed in contexts that are either misleading or borderline offensive. It's used with characters that are explicitly suicidal, often having these characters either attempt or succeed in killing themselves. The idea that Self Harm = Suicide is damaging, and is actually what had me stuck in inpatient as my doctor insisted that my self harm could only be a representation of being actively suicidal (despite both mine and my families pleas that it wasn't. He called my mother naive when she said that wasn't what they meant)\n\nI really wish the whole psych ward girl with cuts on her arm is a ghost stereotype would stop. Just the whole using self harm as a way to demonize psychiatric facilities. I have despised my two inpatient experiences. They have caused some trauma, and as such, I can not personally vouch for the help and therapeutic abilities that these centers hold. However I do believe that it can be extremely helpful when handled voluntarily. I also believe that my first inpatient experience would be less teary if I didn't have this association that inpatient = sick or crazy.\n\nWhile I have come across self harm in games a couple times, sometimes being a mere visual and not something ever mentioned, I've never seen one that treated it as just a coping method. Treating it like it wasn't the end of the world. The best representation i've seen is in Missed Messaged which is a short free game that I would recommend but give a huge trigger warning for. It represents self harm on someone who is using it cope with stress, but even that game has a direct correlation with being suicidal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand why this topic is so hard to handle. You treat it normal, it loses its emotional value. You treat it as this huge thing, it gives it more weight than it needs. If it isn't directly related to character development or plot, its a weird subject to include or talk about. I guess I just wish there were more games where characters had scars. Just scars. No gore. No abusive backstory. No looming suicide attempt.

{"post_id": "chw038", "created_utc": 1564101805, "title": "The Shadow", "author": "LadyBleuuu", "self_text": "Just so everyone is aware: This was written when I was an inpatient in a mental health hospital. I was discharged in March this year (yayye) after spending 14 months there. A good friend told me to post this :). A ligature, for those who don\u2019t know is a non-suspension hanging. Basically, it\u2019s where someone ties something around their neck very tightly in order to off themselves. Also, PRN is a medication that is used in mental health hospitals, and sometimes outside of them to calm people down. PRN stands for something in Latin which means in English \u201cas and when needed\u201d...\n\nThere's this feeling, it's not just a feeling though, really, it's more like a thing. It's mostly black but in some ways it's also more of a dark grey, its colour and size change a lot but it's always there. It resides behind me and is looming over me,, it's wider than me as well, I can feel it wrapping itself around me from behind. It looks and feels like a shadow or maybe a ghost, which is funny really because I don't believe in ghosts but it's what I suppose I'd imagine a ghost to be like. It's cold, heavy and consuming. I can see it in the corner of my eye, both sides, but if I turn around to look for it, there's nothing there. Thus, I know I'm not seeing things because if I was I'd be able to turn around and confront this thing when I look for it. I don't even bother looking for it anymore because I know it's not there. But it is for me. Only me. And I have no idea as to when it joined me. The love of the shadow is evil, but not the sort of evil you would expect to see in a movie but more of a deep, sick, depraved evil that only the shadow could cast upon someone. Unfortunately I was that person; I was chosen by this shadow. \nSometimes when I'm distracting successfully it fades a little and stops towering over me but this isn\u2019t a good thing. As I continue to distract myself it sits there, festering, getting stronger, getting ready to start all over again. Soon, the distraction isn\u2019t enough anymore and it hits me again. Harder than the last time but not quite as hard as it will next time. The urges flood in, the bad thoughts consume my mind, it's all I can think about. I become obsessed, I start planning, plotting, preparing myself, thinking for hours the same plan over and over again. I can hide it for a long time, make myself seem settled, and in some ways I am. I'm settled because I know tonight is the night. I know this most nights and often things get in the way or I mess up and ask for help. I don't know why I ask for help anymore because it's never going to go away; I should have learnt that by now. \nBacking up a bit, the \"thing\" comes back with a vengeance, usually carrying the same three emotions. Despair, frustration and exhaustion. Despair and exhaustion come for the same reason in some ways. I'm in despair because of the emotional pain and it exhausts me. It follows me everywhere. Now I'm frustrated because I'm trapped in bubble wrap. I'm being kept safe here and I can't go home because the doctors who detained me won't let me. \nI start to feel anger build up as I\u2019ve tried to save myself from this hell again and my saviour, my ligature, has been cut and I'm made to live another night. I don't want to be kept safe. The urges are screaming at me, the thing is getting bigger and the PRN and medication is like a joke to this thing because it is almighty and nothing will take the edge off it. It's been growing for a while now; it's stronger than any medication. \nYet again, another day passes and it happens again, except this time I try to find more ways, the ways I went wrong and how I can make it work. I calm down as I finally know again tonight is the night. I finally know that tonight is the night I will be set free.", "subreddit": "MadeOfStyrofoam"}

I was like a zombie going through the motions - go to the store, buy razor blades, rubbing alcohol, neosporin, and gauze, self check out with as few people witnessing my items as possible. Go home, sit on bed, and cut until I feel better. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t even that much a relief...I hated myself for relapsing and I was so conflicted. Why, after 3 years of even very little temptation, did I follow through and relapse? I could\u2019ve stopped at any time. But it was comforting. I knew it wasn\u2019t sustainable but damn it felt safe. \n\nSix weeks pass and now we are to tonight. I\u2019m painfully aware of the blades sitting in my nightstand drawer. Why do I still even have them? I hate myself. Who even am I? I want to cut every inch of my skin until I\u2019m not recognizable. I want to remove every flaw on my body, cut out the acne and stretch marks and (ironically) scars and shape myself into a new person. \n\nI\u2019m never good enough for anyone. In reality I know this is false. I KNOW that I put unrealistic expectations on myself based on what I THINK people want. It\u2019s totally made up, but I swear the thoughts that we make up ourselves are so much more poignant than anything anyone else could tell us. \n\nI just...I don\u2019t want to add any more scars to my body. I really don\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to have to bleed to feel better about myself. I don\u2019t want to hate myself this much, feel this shitty about myself, feel this inadequate. \n\nI\u2019ve been (maybe stupidly?) posting nudes on some NSFW subreddits in hopes that the comments from strangers will boost my self confidence. But it feels so fake. Of course they\u2019re going to compliment a naked girl. Plus, I realized that I don\u2019t really give a fuck what strangers think. Sure, it\u2019s nice to know that people think you\u2019re attractive, but I don\u2019t care about these people. They aren\u2019t the people who I want to find me attractive, you know?\n\nSo basically right now I\u2019m trying to fill this weird empty void inside of myself that I haven\u2019t felt in 3 years. My less-harmful but still not healthy coping strategy of over eating hasn\u2019t helped. I\u2019ve been working out more (in a reasonable fashion) but it doesn\u2019t seem to give me that endorphin boost anymore. I want to chain smoke some cigarettes but they give me gnarly headaches. \n\nI\u2019m 2 months out of a 5 year relationship. I relied on him a lot for reassurance. I could always ask him, \u201cHey, am I sexy to you?\u201d And he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to shower me with compliments. I realize now that it isn\u2019t healthy to depend on someone for confidence. And I realize now how fucking hard it is to learn to be confident from the inside, without factoring in what anyone else thinks.\n\nI guess I just don\u2019t want to cut but I also don\u2019t know how to make myself feel better. This sucks. Maybe I\u2019ll go buy a pack of smokes and deal with the headache when it inevitably comes.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I\u2019m not sure why it didn\u2019t occur to me to search before today. \n\nI searched for this sub because I felt the need to reach out; to read other peoples experiences because I\u2019ve never really fully talked or asked about my destructive behaviors. Today, I felt I needed to because I just feel myself getting worse. \n\nBack in December, I went to visit a lab to learn how to properly run an experiment. Long story short, on my last day, I broke a 2L bottle of dye (which I\u2019m still ashamed of to this day) and took two pieces of broken glass with me. I took them with me because in the moment, even though I didn\u2019t, I wanted to cut. I also felt that perhaps there would be another day in the future where I\u2019d want to cut myself and I\u2019d be happy to have these broken pieces of glass. \n\nToday, I took a late lunch break. I was starving and decided to go buy some food. I brought it home and ate it. I felt exhausted; I passed out asleep instead of going back to work. Luckily, I have very flexible hours at my job but that in no way means I can just go to lunch, fall asleep, and wake up at around 9pm. I felt and feel awful. I received a text from someone I was supposed to do a procedure with. I couldn\u2019t reply. Being depressed, along with having PTSD and bipolar just doesn\u2019t seem like a proper excuse for anything. I don\u2019t want to use it as an excuse. I also don\u2019t want to tell the people immediately around me my diagnosis. I was conflicted, in emotional agony, and wanted all these fucking feelings to just fucking end. \n\nThen, I remembered the two pieces of glass. It felt fitting that I feel worthless over my lab work today and the two pieces were taken from another lab incident that I was ashamed of. My arm now looks worse than it\u2019s ever been. I don\u2019t remember the last time I hurt myself without caring where I was doing it. I wasn\u2019t thinking of how I\u2019d hide it later, which I usually do. I was just in so much pain and had so many feelings I just had to cut. It was the only thing I could think of to help me. \n\nThe thing is, I\u2019ve always been hesitant of using a blade. I think that in my mind, that would be \u201ctoo far.\u201d I\u2019ve used other objects like paper clips, thick plastic, OTC medicine containers... but those never go too deep and they\u2019re mostly superficial scratching with minor bleeding. I\u2019ve used a broken piece of ceramic before but I didn\u2019t hurt myself terribly. This broken glass was sharp and did the job better. I enjoyed seeing the result. \n\nHowever, I feel another sense of shame and worry... How am I supposed to hide 3/4ths of my arm properly in the summer? Why did I let myself do so much harm? How do I hide this from my mom? I see her this weekend and idk how to explain this to her or if I even should... which that thought ended up resulting in more self-harm... I think I\u2019ll just have to wear long sleeves and make up excuses as I can.... but despite this sense of worry and shame, I keep thinking about how at work we have packs and packs of razors. I feel like I want to go \u201ctoo far\u201d and just take a few home with me. I don\u2019t think I should but I also feel I should. \n\nI\u2019m not even fully sure what I\u2019m trying to accomplish with this post.

I stayed another week and then got sent home again couple of days ago. \n\nSh is addicting as many of you might have experienced and I've felt that too but earlier I could limit quite a bit and go some time in between sessions but now after that incident idk, the addictive force or whatever is so much stronger now. I feel proud of how deep I went and I want to do it again, really fucking badly... I know that all this is bs and I don't endorse sh in any way but my brain just tells me good job, it feels like I went to the next level and that I need to keep it up... Idk why or how I began with it but I quickly realized that it eased my anxiety and bad thoughts much quicker than anything else I've tried, it also made me able to go longer without breaking down. I've been harming myself (mostly by cutting) for soon 2 years but it feels so different now. Now it doesn't feel like I'm doing it to ease pain but more like it's something I need and want and should do more of... I'm actually a little scared. \n\nJust wanna mention that I am in contact with people trying to help me who are good at their jobs, I'm doing my best and reaching out to get help. This incident though has changed me and I had to share it to see if anyone else has felt the same. I thought I was doing better actually, I began going longer between sh sessions and it felt like I was making progress but then when everything crashed it was like my brain thought that I had save up sh points and had to spend them all. Now afterwards I feel like I've fallen even lower down than ever before (regarding sh that is).\n\nIt would mean a lot if anyone would share their similar experiences if you've had them and maybe send some hugs as well...

She said we need to find some better coping mechanisms for me. But I just... I've tried them all. Life has been really, terribly bad for me this past year with only a small handful of good things. At what point do you need better coping mechanisms, and at what point do you just need *a less garbage life*? I've tried all of the things she suggested like ice cubes and rubber bands and so on, but none of it works as well as cutting. The only thing I've found other than cutting which makes a big enough difference to keep me around is drugs, and I have been there and done that with the whole chemical dependency thing. I do not want to go down that road again.\n\nIsn't there a point where no amount of healthy habits can keep someone going? It feels like I'm going through a surgery and being told I need \"better coping mechanisms\" than the anaesthetic they would normally use, so I just have to suffer through it with no help. I just don't think it can be done, at least not by me. Maybe I'm weak. Is there such a thing is life just being so terrible that good coping mechanisms aren't near enough? I feel like at this point it's either take a long step off a high rise or tear up my arms all the time. I don't even know which is better.\n\nI guess this is mostly venting. I just don't know what to do. I can't catch a break.\n\nAnd to be clear I haven't been indignant with my therapist or anything. I know she's trying to help. I just think healthy habits and good coping mechanisms can only deal with so much suffering. I'm a mess. I just need bad things to stop happening to me so much.

The entire trip I ate maybe 2 or 3 meals the others I ate I don't count because I threw them up immediately afterwards. \n\nOne of the first few nights people were singing and being joyful but I just sat in my chair staring off to space and I didn't want people to see me cry so I rushed off to one of the many portable bathrooms. I sat there trying to hold myself together and then came the urges. I wanted to cut. So badly but I didn't have anything with me so I tried my nails. I dug them into my forearms and upper thigh but it just wasn't enough. I tried snapping the mirror on the door but I couldn't get it. I looked down and there was a rock about the size of the tip of my pointer. It was round with a slightly jagged edge. I put all my strength behind it ripping a line into my thigh but I gave up when I couldn't go any deeper. I couldn't even draw blood. Defeated I walked out and there was my ex and best friend standing there waiting. She said I was gone for a long time even though it only felt like 30 seconds. I hugged her and cried into her shoulder. \n\n2 nights later she forced me to eat. I grabbed a plastic fork and knife and slipped them into my pocket. I threw up my food and lied there crying my stomach in unbearable pain. My stomach was completely empty and felt like it was eating me alive. It was so tight and if I placed any pressure I flinched in pain and dry heaved. I snapped the fork into a point and tried to cut myself. I couldn't put enough force without it breaking. I grabbed my plastic knife and bit the cheap shitty bumps meant to cut food off and formed it into sharp peaks. It was like looking at a mountain range or a scary jagged chunk of metal. I used one hand to spread the skin and tighten it and used all my force and made several quick swipes blood pouring down my thigh I couldn't continue my hands were shaking so badly. I managed 14 lines. \n\nI'm laying here on my bed watching my hands shake just wanting to feel real. I want to feel like myself. Most times I can't even tell if I'm here or not.

And I get that i can't control her actions, but i also can't ever remove that worry. The fact that she has to watch the way she interacts with me has ruined our relationship. \n\nToday, my closest cousin and very best friend called and he said that my scars are very triggering for him, and that they make him really upset. He asked me if I can cover them up whenever I'm hanging out with him. I said yes, obviously, because he has a lot of problems with SH and honestly it probably really was insensitive of me to have them out around him. But I'm really worried because by his tone and wording, he's really upset with me, and mad at me. I don't blame him, because I KNOW how much SH has affected his life -- he's been in and out of hospitals for years now, and I really, really should have known better.\n\nI wish I had never started. I never would have had any of these problems. I've ruined two of the most important relationships in my life, and it was completely preventable. I can't ever take it back. I'm going to try to improve and assuage everyone's concerns, and I really hope I can build my relationship with my cousin back up, but I know I can never take back what I've done. I can't make my mom worry less, and I can't make my cousin feel better about it. And I can't make anyone not see them when I wear revealing clothing, or stop anyone from being triggered. I think I'm going to stop wearing revealing clothing. I love my cousin, and I don't want anyone to feel the way that he does. I wish I didn't have scars, or that my family didn't know.

We got to the restaurant and ordered pizza.\nI just got my braces, so it was really hard for me to eat it normally. Instead, I got a fork and knife. By then, I was over my panic attack, so I put my music away. We started talking, and the conversation adjusted to my grandparents criticizing me for listening to music the whole car ride, even though they were doing the same thing and never said a word the whole time. I couldn't explain because they wouldn't understand. So they kept criticizing and making fun of me. I started feeling worthless, like that's all I'm ever going to do with my life. I eventually felt like I was going to cry. I excused myself to use the bathroom, but I accidentally took the plastic knife with me.\nI broke down in there. I've known I've had my mental disorders since fifth grade, but I was going into one of the worst depressive episodes of my life then. I couldn't take the pain anymore so I just cut my bottom thumb knuckle. It felt so good to finally have an outlet for my pain. I stopped. I was terrified to what I was going to become with this new addiction.\nI went back home. They had no plastic knives there, so I got a butter knife. I tried that for a few days, but it would take forever to actually cut the skin, so I moved on to a meat knife. Still didn't work. I suddenly had an idea. I saw the heart shaped pencil sharpener my elementary school gave me for a graduation gift. I finally had a blade that would immediately draw blood. And now I've been doing that ever since.\nI've cut myself almost anywhere you can imagine: my hands, my chest, my stomach, my thighs, my knees, my shins, my ankles, my shoulders, but my wrist is where it stuck.

Things were bad, very bad. I self-harmed by cutting, hitting myself, starving myself and when I developed digestive problems and chronic anal fissures, I refused treatment. I attempted suicide multiple times, ran away from home twice. My arms, abdomen, waist and thighs were full of cuts. I'd spend my days crying, sleeping and cutting myself. I dropped out of college (I'm back now with only a year lost, so no biggie).\n\nBut that's months ago now. I've gotten better with help from kind strangers I met online, but no one in my life helped. \n\nI got the generic \"stop doing it\", \"go out\", \"be strong\" and all those non-helpful comments. What little treatment I got was me being taken to a **Neuro Surgeon.** I'm no expert on depression but I don't think neuro surgeons are either. This one straight up told me I was fine and \"everyone goes through shit in their life so I need to just shut up and stop acting out.\"\n\nThat was the worst thing I heard. Specially coming from a doctor who I thought would help me.\n\nAnyhow, I'm ranting. \n\nSo today, 15 mins earlier tbh, an acquaintance of my mother came over. He's still here btw. And he brings up that time. It's still a painful experience for me to talk about. I'm better but not healed so I'm sensitive about all that. \n\nSo now he says how absolutely stupid I had been acting. Depression is when people don't control their emotions or are looking for attention. \n\nI don't know how to take it. I got a lump in my throat as soon as I heard it and didn't want to cry infront of them so I left the room. Last thing I heard was, \"See she knows she was wrong and now is embarrassed about it.\"\n\nI feel so angry and sad. I can almost feel my demons lurking somewhere in the background of my mind. Reminding me where I've stashed my blades. My arms are itching and I'm so tempted to cut. I was subconsciously scratching my arms.

{"post_id": "cio6hf", "created_utc": 1564268036, "title": "My story is what follows. Can anyone relate?", "author": "undermydeathbed", "self_text": "It was mid-July in 2014. I was 14 years old. We were under an incredible amount of stress due to pending homelessness, and I had lost all hope. One day, as we were continuing to pack up our stuff to put into storage, I decided it'd be a good idea to scrape my skin with a metal nail. Just one small cut on my right arm. *That's how it started.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt was the middle of April in 2015. I had survived a three month period of living in a family shelter, as well as two hospitalizations, one in late October 2014, the next in early November 2014. I hadn't cut for 9 months or so, but I resided in the hospital for the third time in less than a year. You know how that goes down. At that time, the adolescent unit had a policy that said level threes must eat on the unit, with trays, in your rooms, with the door wide open. So I had befriended this one girl who was obviously big into cutting, given that she had scars up and down her arms. She was using the plastic knife from her tray to, well, cut herself. I don't remember what happened next, but I ended up making the connection between that action and the sense of the relief I felt back in July of 2014. Before I knew it, I was sawing away at my arm. Still just one or two cuts, but, if I recall correctly, I proceeded to do it several more times over the next two weeks I resided there in the hospital.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI don't remember much of what happened within the two years following that hospitalization in April of 2015. There was another hospitalization in May of 2016, but I don't remember if there was any major regressions (as far as cutting goes) before late March 2017.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Sigh.* March of 2017 was a crazy month. It began with me meeting a girl through an app called Chatous. Turns out this girl is an alcoholic. Or she was. At 15. Scary as hell. Her and I stopped talking by the last Sunday in March. Good thing we did, because the next day I met the girl who would define the next year of my life. But I'm getting ahead of myself with digressions. On March 28th, 2017, my best friend was admitted to a hospital local to her area (I'm big on long distance friendships and relationships. In-person is just too challenging, you know?). I was devastated, but that's beside the point. A few days later, on that following Friday, there was a church event that I was to participate in. I didn't mind the participation, but I felt so alone and dejected. When we returned home, I went straight up to my room, shut the door, put some NF on repeat, and made about 30 or so cuts on my right arm using a travel-size plastic comb in one sitting. I was 17, and, as far as I can recall, I wouldn't cut for another 11 months or so. As has become typical by that point, I would reside inpatient for the first half of April 2017, and for just a day or two in January 2018.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFebruary 2018 was, in a phrase, the beginning of the end. For many things. I'd end up in a series of fights with the girl who I said would define the year. One of those ended in me making a singular cut on the side of my right wrist, which would end up being my last until November 2018, when I made (once again) another singular cut on my right arm. (I'm left-handed, and I have a disability that prevents me from being able to finely control the movement of my right hand and fingers.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDecember went off without a hitch, and Christmas 2018 was by far one of the best times of my life. But the joy didn't last long, for on December 30th, 2018 I made the first in what would become a month-long string of cutting, cutting, and more cutting. By January 30th, 2019, I had made something like 52 cuts on my right arm, the left side of my abdomen, and my left thigh. For no reason other than... literally only God knows why.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe next time I'd cut would be May 1st, 2019. The spring semester had just ended, and final grades had just been posted. I found that while I earned the expected B in sociology, I also earned an unexpected B in human communication, a class where I had held an A all semester up to that point. I was absolutely devastated, and I sought solace and punishment in cutting. By that point, my mother had confiscated all my plastic combs, so I found something else: scissors. Over the next three days or so, I would continue to use the scissors inappropriately, making 5 or 6 cuts before May 4th, at which point I was evaluated in the ED for suicidal ideation as well as an inability to keep myself safe due to two suicide attempts. I was admitted to the hospital yet again for 5 days, from May 5th to the 10th. I was perfectly fine over the weekend, but the 14th is when things started to get foggy. I found where my mom put one of the plastic combs, and I began to cut myself. They weren't having it over at PHP, so they did a direct readmit to the hospital, where I would reside until May 24th. It's well worth mentioning that I was experiencing urges while I was in the hospital.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOn Saturday, June 1st, 2019, I was experiencing really bad urges, and I didn't have anything I could cut with since my mother took the knives, combs, scissors, and assorted sharp objects. What did I do? I used the dull-but-sharp nails of my right fingers to scratch a portion of my left arm up so bad that it not only broke the skin, but also produced a lasting scar that is obnoxiously still present to this day.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThat brings us to this month. I forget whether it was late night on Saturday the 13th or early morning on Sunday the 14th, but I was once again feeling urges, so I made a singular cut on my left ankle. That was that, or so I thought.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOn Monday, July 15th, I had a very interesting therapy session. My, who I hadn't seen in three weeks, asked me if I had done any cutting. I ashamedly hung my head and said yes. We proceeded to spend the next 50 minutes talking about why I do it and what I get out of it. The next thing I know, she directly tells me, \"You're an addict.\" Of course, I deny this accusation because *I don't have a problem*. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBetween Tuesday, July 16th and today, Saturday, July 27th, I have made 33 cuts, for no real reason other than urges. Does that prove my therapist's point? Probably. But I don't care. I don't have a problem.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI tried to tell myself I could quit for my birthday (just give it up for one day) but I couldn't even do that. I feel powerless, and it just keeps getting bigger and bigger. I still don't have a problem, though.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThat's my story thus far. What's yours?", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

A few days ago while I was asleep she  came in my room, probably to wake me or something, and saw the scars on my leg. She freaked out crying, waking me up. She was balling her eyes out and tried to get me to promise to stop (these are old scars btw). She kept asking me about it, and demanded I showed her my arms. Which I refused. She then proceeded to tell me how it was her right because I'm her granddaughter, etc etc. I, fustrated at this point, walked into another room. She then says she dosent understand me so if I dont stop and show her and come clean shes gonna do it to go understand me better. Now I fucking HATE being guilt-tripped, so I said okay and closed the door. It's my body and my choice how I cope, same goes for her. After about a minute she swung open my door, holding a big kitchen knife and asked me to do it for her. I immediately grabbed my keys, phone, and wallet and was out the door in a minute. I went to the park and cried on a bench for about 20 minutes. That was the most triggering thing Ive ever heard someone say, I feel so violated and horrible that she had such a manic reaction.

We were on the phone for no more than 60 seconds yesterday and he was talking to someone else for part of it, so I was frustrated and said talk to you later and hung up. He didn't call or text for the rest of the night and I texted this morning that it bothered me. He apologized but it felt very half assed, like \"you could've called.\" But this was a guys weekend that I was specifically not invited on so I didn't want to interrupt.

We are afraid that when we do someone will say no and it\u2019ll push us over the edge. Rejection is all too familiar for us and when the people who are supposed to help us reject us we think we aren\u2019t deserving of the help. This happened to me. I was sick of being sad so I went to hospital but the physiatrist rejected me. She said \u201cI don\u2019t believe you want to die\u201d. That shook me to my core. It hurt hearing a professional tell me how I feel and say it with such confidence. I have been in pain for so long and to hear someone nullify my feelings hurt. I was too afraid to tell her she was wrong and she sent me back home. She told me that I shouldn\u2019t because it\u2019s \u201ca last resort\u201d but it\u2019s my last resort. I have attempted twice since then one of which was when I got home and the other was about a week ago. I made my Mom a promise and it isn\u2019t helping me. Cutting helps. It\u2019s my release and when she takes it away it will build and build until the time is up and I cut again. It\u2019s an awful feeling. The hospital has only made things worse. They made me stay up all night to ask me questions and they just rejected me after. This is why we don\u2019t ask for help. We feel like we aren\u2019t allowed to because people make assumptions. I wish I had just stood up to her but I couldn\u2019t instead I froze. I went into pretend mode and I pretended my way out of it. I wasn\u2019t even thinking I just did it. Like a reflex.

I know these things might not be universal, and you may have tried them and others over and over.\n\nBut they helped me, so I hope they can help someone else.\n\n\nFor me, intrusive thoughts is definitely one of the things that contribute most to my habits of self harm. Distancing myself from the intrusive thoughts have helped me. I act like a dude called Dean is in my head telling me all of these things. It's easier to just say \"stfu Dean, I don't like you\" than trying to convince myself that I'm not a bad person for thinking those thoughts, and all the other baggage that comes along with intrusive thoughts. \nI tried a similar technique twice before and it didn't work, then I acted like someone was casting the empirius curse (sorry if that is spelled incorrectly) on me, or that Donald trump was telling me these things.\nIt didn't help, because it didn't feel like something that could happen. So calling my intrusive thoughts something normal, like Dean, has helped me distance myself from them.\n\n\n\nThe point above has helped me, but intrusive thoughts aren't the only thing that makes me want to relapse, and honestly I don't have techniques for all of the different things that makes me want to selfharm.\nBut I'd say that the thing that has helped me the most is to NOT CELEBRATE. \n\nI make it a point to not celebrate whenever I've made it a week, or a month without self-harming. If I celebrate, I think everything's okay, and my mind jumps to a place where I think \"well, now that I'm celebrating, I can just as well give myself a little gift\" and then I harm myself. I give in.\n\nI will acknowledge that I have gone certain amounts of time without selfharming, but throughout these 2 months I have not celebrated any one of my milestones.

One time I had to perform in a big improv tournament, short sleeved with the biggest bruise I had ever given myself was at it's biggest and darkest against my pale skin. Told everyone there it was from a dumbell, bruise lasted two and a half weeks. Now usually I focus in one area instead of all along the forearm.

Today I made myself bleed for the first time. I've been depressed for about 12 years, and have had suicidal periods on and off, but I've mainly been fine the past three months with only a couple of bad days. Last year was hell for me, the year before not much better, but I finally felt like I was finding myself again. But the past couple of weeks I've had three pretty bad incidents of suicidal ideations and/or a need to self-harm. \n\nI completely lost it today, and for something trivial. I live in an apartment block that has a laundry room in the basement and I have to use this card that I fill up with money to be able to wash my clothes. The card has been faulty lately, and the people responsible haven't been able to help me. Today, it refused to let me clean during my reserved time, so I had to book again, but our washing machines were already taken. I have access to the neighboring apartment blocks because they belong to the same people, so I tried booking the laundry room in the one next to mine. I was able to get in the front door with my normal key, but for some reason the key didn't work in the laundry room even though I do have access to it. It was the last time slot of the day, all of my work appropriate clothes are dirty and I *have* to clean them tonight. \n\nWhen I got back up to my apartment, I screamed and cried and ended up using my keys harm myself. I started on my arm, but changed my mind and went crazy on my leg instead because I didn't want my coworkers to see the scratches tomorrow. I'm sitting on my bed crying and I look down to see blood running down my leg. I was in shock for a couple of minutes, I mean, I've been doing this for EIGHT YEARS and I draw blood for the first time over laundry?! I didn't do it when I was living under the constant stress of emotional/psychological abuse by my mother, I didn't do it when I got my heart broken by the man of my dreams, I didn't do it when I was in months of extreme stress while finishing my master's, I didn't do it right after or while dealing with the trauma of being raped, it happened when I couldn't do my laundry. \n\nI feel like I'm losing it. The last time I had a breakdown and felt extremely suicidal a few days ago was over something pretty stupid too, although something more understandable given my history (I felt abandoned, lonely and unloved). This is insane though. This is completely insane. There was so much more blood than I thought, but the pain isn't too bad. Blood makes be queasy so I'm terrified of examining the wound. I don't know what's going on with me right now, and I won't be able to see my therapist because of my work hours. I'm scared.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Just very venty, needing to get this out before I burst", "author": "PufferfishBecca", "self_text": "To set the scene, I'm currently at band camp(Sunday through Wednesday, and it's currently 1:18AM on technically Wednesday), and like half my friend group is here as well, including my boyfriend.\n\nWell, obv. lots of my bf's friends are here too, and it's just been really shitty because I keep (stupidly) getting jealous when he shows them more attention than me, or when he just does something that's like a \"but X does it for Y, why can't you do the same for me?\" Just lots of ugly feelings towards myself, him, and those around us. \n\nI know it's not right and that he's completely entitled to hang out with them and not pay attention to me 24/7, but I can't help feeling what I feel, ya know? Mind and heart not on the same level. \n\nI've had these feelings before (I'm really dependent on our relationship, whoops), but they are never this strong and usually I can get over it by enjoying how cute he looks goofing off with them but this time? It justs getting worse and worse and it's really coming to a boiling point tonight since...\n\nWell, we both had to run back towards the front of tbe camp for something. I was grabbing my phone, and 2 friends, so i was going further but I asked him to wait on me, since I'd only really be a minute. And he just refused and said \"I gotta get back\". \n\nAnd it just, I don't know. Literally anyone else would have just stayed, friends, boy/girlfriend, etc etc. It wasn't a big request, and I did make it back literally a minute later than him. It just really irked me the wrong way and I just, I would do it for him? My friends would do it for me? It just seemed so oddly placed and more like \"I don't want to wait for you\".\n\nAnd before that, when I asked if he'd go with me (before I knew he was going for something unrelated) he was just really \"ehh\" about it and like, seemed annoyed or something when I asked about it a second time since I never got an answer. It was like he just didn't want to be around me, and its making me really fucking sad. \n\nI know I'm looking too much into it but I don't know. It's just like, lots of little things building up. Most of it is jokes, or us not hanging out even once during the breaks even though he knows I won't be able see him for awhile after camp. Or just, fuck, so many tiny things and its really wearing me down and now I'm starting to cry again. \n\nI just feel so jealous and ugly and upset at myself, and him, and everything. I don't want to feel this way, and I'm trying to get over it but I just can't. I hate myself for being so weak and dependent on him. I \"hate\" him for not just waiting for me like I asked. I hate this whole stupid camp having to happen when I've been clean for the longest time and barely getting past (broke it tonight though). \n\nI just don't know what to do about the situation. Today I just found myself getting a little snappy towards him and just really distant in general towards the end of the day. I didn't even bother saying goodnight to him because I was so angry at it all.\n\nI have to face him tomorrow and I don't think I'll manage to not mention something. But I don't want to because he's valid and fine and doing nothing wrong, but even if I say that he'll feel bad and i don't want to force him away from his friends. \n\nRelationships really suck when you overthink everything, don't let yourself build good, meaningful relationships with other friends, and rely too heavily on one person for your happiness. Don't do that y'all, its stupid as hell. \n\nUghhh. Thanks for joining me on my rant anyway.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I'm not even a day clean. But put that aside, that is not what I wanted to ask. \n\nYesterday I have a big discovery.\n\nI have a senior who is a close friend of my friend (bad english, I'm sorry) that I admire a lot one way or the other. When she(senior) is talking to my friend, she doesn't mind me also listening. So sometimes I hear what they were talking about. However, yesterday after school, she was wearing a jacket. Pretty normal, right? Yup. Except she pulled her sleeves and reveal her fresh cut to me and my friend. She was telling every single detail about how she did it, what she did it with, and how she is... proud of it?? I just stand there in shock. I don't know what to feel, everything is mixed in the same pot. I felt angry, ashamed, guilty, confused, and proud?? for admitting to us. She said it was her first cut. It was not bad, but I am mortified. As someone who has been cutting for god knows how long, the urge to reach out to her is strong, but I am scared. Again, back to how she reacted when she showed her cut. I wanted to tell her to stop and let me help her, but I didn't. I was not okay. I don't get why she is so proud of it. She left to go home, and my friend looks at me, also confused. She(friend) has spotted few of my cuts in the past, and I told her I don't want to talk about it yet, and she accepted this.

We were lining up in front of the prayer room. My friend talked to her again. I listened to their conversation. She told my friend how she did it again in the class, and other details.

I wanted to scream, I wanted to cry, but I can't. I still don't get why she is proud of it. \n\nYes, I am a muslim, she is also a muslim. Yes, we did our prayers 5 times a day. Yes, our place is quite religious. No, I didn't cut myself because I wanted attention from the leaders. If someone told you the reason otherwise, show them this.\n\nWhat do I do? What should I feel?

I was wearing a bikini so you could see my scars. At this point, I've sometimes even forgotten that not everyone self harms or how scary/uncomfortable they can make other people. They saw, and asked what happened, and I told them that I had been depressed but was better now. It was awkward for a moment and then one friend was like \"Wow I'm sorry that really sucks\" and then changed the subject and I was relieved. Later on, two of the friends separately approached me saying that if I ever wanted to talk to them about anything they were here for me and had dealt with depression as well. I was grateful to them to say that, but I also wasn't actually going to tell them all the shit I was going through at the beginning of a friendship, I think it'd be tmi personally.
