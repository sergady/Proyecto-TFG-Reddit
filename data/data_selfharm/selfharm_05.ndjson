I feel like I\u2019m not a \u2018real\u2019 self Garner if I don\u2019t cause a certain amount of damage to myself or leave a certain type of scar.

They were closed for the holiday, so I tried a suicide prevention hotline. It was so much better than I expected. I had always thought \"What could they possibly do in an hour that my counselor couldn't do in 5 years.\"\n\nIt was nice. They listened to everything I said, they never contradicted me, just listened and gave me reassurance. Typing it out, it doesn't sound like much, but it really really made a difference. To have someone just listen and say \"mmhmm, I understand.\" It felt so genuine, and that really helped.\n\nI was transferred to a local groups hotline, and the woman I spoke with was pretty great. She asked me my name and my age, which...I dunno. I really liked that. Just being asked about who I was.\n\nEveryone's experience is different, of course, but I'm glad I called. Tonight was probably the worst I've had, as far as self harm goes. But I feel a lot better, having called the hotline and asked for their advice.

So when I was told as such, I broke down (yet again; but this time I wasnt able to recover). Now im unable to show anyone (not even him) my true emotions.

I knew her since only a few month and we saw each other only one time but we used to talk about our problem and she was the one i trusted the most. She advised me to talk about my sh to other friends since we were living quite far away and she couldn't help me properly. I told  friend who wasn't living close either, because i was to scarred to talk to other friend i had. He didn't reacted badly but nor understood. He told about my sh to other friends of mine and although they didn't react badly, i knew they didn't really understood.  We never really talked about it since then.

I've been feeling weird before that, had troubles with basic tasks I've never had any trouble before,stuff like that, you all probably know that :D My mom was perplexed at first but eventually became very accepted and hugged me. She even told me later that she researched sf and I felt just so warm inside, u know? She still doesn't really understand some stuff about sf and depression, but she listens when I try to explain it, so that's great. \n\nThe appointment to the therapist went great too. At least, if you can call crying and loudly saying I want to kill myself great! She gave me a new perspective on some things I've been having trouble with lately and I think I finally solved some issues my friend and I had thanks to her. However, after I described her my current situation, how I felt etc, she told me I *could\" have depression and that I certainly should go see a doctor... Kinda scared of that right now. Unfortunately, due to a lot if celebrations here in Russia (we don't work or study for 5 fucking days because of the 1st of May and then we'll have another holiday at May 9) I won't be able to go to a doctor soon, but I'm trying to not stay down right now, although it's a bit hard.

One, my deepest, is not red surrounding the opening of the cut, I can still feel a little indent but just barely, I can see some sort of flesh or something forming in a bubble texture inside that is a paler, slightly yellower version of my skin color (which is white). The second one is a little tiny bit red around the edges, and is growing back fine as far as I know. The third one is the second deepest and growing the flesh stuff inside it but is more of a yellow color, has a little tiny bit of redness around the edges, and I barely feel an indent, if anything it feels almost flat or level.

If I say the red, thick welts on my arms are bug bites, people will wonder what the thinner, longer scars on my arms are.

It's true and I'm sure you've heard this countless times. Here are some reasons why, imo:\n\n- Doing it because you're **numb** and trying to feel something? From personal experience, **the high eventually wears off**. I no longer feel excited and alive after doing it. In fact, I get all the more dissociative, feel vaguely horrified, and ultimately dislike myself even more. \n\n- Doing it to feel a sense of **control**? Trust me, there is *absolutely* *nothing* that can make you feel more out of control than potentially having people you aren't comfortable with seeing your cuts, being forced into treatment when you aren't ready, accidentally hurting yourself more seriously than intended, or just ruining a good clean streak. \n\n- Doing it to relieve **anxiety**? For me, self harm *increases* anxiety in the long run. I panic at the thought of family members seeing my cuts. I panic after oversharing to friends about self harm. I worry about clothing. Furthermore, cutting yourself doesn't solve what you're worried about \u2014 in fact, it might *make them worse*. Just because I cut myself doesn't mean my bad relationships will be repaired. \n\n- Doing it to cope with **isolation/loneliness**? I can definitely relate and I'm sorry, it's awful. But if there's one thing that makes things worse it's hurting yourself. People start looking at you with this specific mixture of pity and discomfort. You feel more like a freak, trapped in disordered thoughts and behaviours. And that's not to mention the social events you deliberately miss/can't enjoy because of self harm related reasons. It's a **vicious cycle of isolation** and you don't deserve to be caught in it. \n\n- Doing it because you made mistakes and want to **punish yourself**? 100% relatable as well. But self harm doesn't help address the thing you screwed up/make amends with people/etc. **And it doesn't at all make you a better or cleaner person**. It's also another a vicious cycle: self harm only normalizes and reinforces the idea that you deserve punishment, causing a detrimental downward spiral. **But you're *not* defective and you *don't* deserve to hurt yourself**. Trust me. \n\nPerhaps most importantly: \n\n- If you're only just starting to self harm, or are considering self harm as a coping mechanism, know that it's an **addiction** that you must absolutely stop now before it gets out of hand. Because past a certain point you won't feel able to stop. And there's no such thing as \"I'll only do it once or twice when I'm in a real crisis\". Even after the crisis is over, **everything will start becoming triggering**. You'll want to self harm even when happy. You'll want to self harm simply out of boredom on an otherwise good day. \n\nI'm sure you know all this already, but here's just a reminder to anyone who may find it helpful \u2013 and especially to myself lmao. \n\nStay strong and stay safe.

We were meant to meet up for a day out (with other friends) over the weekend but he cancelled last minute and then didn\u2019t come to work the next day. I was naturally very worried about him but thankfully he came back to work the next day and has family have taken him to the doctor for professional help. I wanted to give him his own space before approaching him, just to tell him that I would be there for him if he needed anything (talk/sit in silence/go out etc.) and that I wouldn\u2019t judge/pity him/try to make him tell me about it and why etc. I also told him about my previous experiences (I don\u2019t self harm but I suffer from chronic depression and ADHD) and another one of my friends used to self harm. He seemed very responsive and opened up to me a little about his struggles and his coping mechanisms which I am hoping is a good sign as he is an extremely shy and quiet guy. \n\nI was thinking about a small token of showing that I care and that I\u2019m not just saying the above (I\u2019m usually a person of action rather than words as I\u2019m always worried about saying the wrong thing (purely because I like him as more than a friend and I\u2019m hopeless like that \ud83d\ude14).

It is something that I would like to see happen for me but is it too much? Too sappy (I\u2019m a 27 F and he is a 28 M)? Too pushy? Too weird? Too girly?

Plasters, gloves, bandages and waterproof dressings are a good starting point for making a first aid kit.  Keep an eye on existing wounds too - are they inflamed? Are they oozing pus? Are they getting worse rather than better? This could be a sign of infection and you may need to see a doctor.\n\nDo I need medical attention?\n\nHow does blood flow? If it's a small trickle or just tiny beads of blood, a good clean and plaster may be all you need, but if blood is 'pulsing' you may have nicked an artery which will put your health in grave danger unless you seek medical attention as a matter of urgency.\n\nHow big is the injury? If it's bigger than about a 50p piece then get it checked, especially if it's a burn.\n\nIs it affecting a joint? If so, get it checked - you are risking the future health of that joint if it doesn't heal properly.\n\nHave you got something stuck in your skin? Leave it where it is, secure the area with a bandage of you need to and get some medical help.\n\nHave you burnt your skin? Are your clothes sticking to the area? Leave them alone and get some help. Don't try to peel them off. You also cannot do anything about chemical burns - always seek advice if that's the case and tempting though it is..... never EVER burst any blisters. They are all part of the healing process.\n\nAlways make sure you drink plenty of fluids - staying hydrated will help replace any lost blood.\n\nNo-one can diagnose you over the internet, and no-one can assess any injury as well as a trained professional. The quality of care you may experience in different health-care settings may vary, but be bold, look after yourself, and speak out if you need help.\n\nThe biggest rule is to never, ever, hurt yourself whilst under the influence of alcohol or drugs. It's not good when you're sober, but when you're judgement is impaired it'll much harder to recognise when you need help.\n\nLearning to live with scars....\n\nAn important part of the recovery process is learning to live with scarring that may have been caused by harming actions. Scars are permanent - there are steps you can take to improve the appearance of scars, but learning to live alongside them will be a massive part of your recovery. Is it possible to love your scars and view them as an important part of your past? How do you manage if people make comments or ask you how they occurred? We can advise you but the answers will be different for everyone.\n\nIt's okay not to like your scars - liking them is very different from accepting them. Sometimes doctors or psychiatrists will ask to see your scars and you may not feel comfortable with that - again, that's okay, no-one can force you to show any part of your body if you're not happy for them to see.\n\nYour scars are a result of how you have injured yourself, but they are not a reflection of what is happening to you emotionally - not having scars or any physical sign of self-harm doesn't mean you are not having difficulties - you don't need to try and scar yourself to prove you need help, and having lots of scars doesn't mean you can't recover.\n\nWhat you choose to tell people who notice your scars is up to you. There is no right or wrong answer; it comes down to whatever you feel comfortable telling people. Having a history of self-harm is nothing to be ashamed about - we hope that by now you have realised it's more common than you think. You don't have to tell people, but you also don't have to avoid it.\n\nThere are a variety of camouflage make-up products out there that you may feel will be helpful - these have been designed for all kinds of skin complaints, from birth marks to scars caused by accidents. They are suitable for use all over the body, including your face, are waterproof and suitable for use when swimming, and you may be able to obtain them on prescription from an understanding GP. \n\n****found on google whilst browsing not my work!****", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

The scars are fading, so the blade is the item I use to confront myself when I want to cut. I tell myself \u201cDo you want to go back to this?\u201d Then I always put it away.

I have few other memento\u2019s from that time that I kept. But those are all displayed somewhere at home and sticking a blade in the middle would be awful. \nI don\u2019t really want to throw it away, but I do plan on never using it again.\n\nAnyone else who is clean now: Was anyone in a similar situation?

Not all of these ways are understood by those around us nor are they always safe and or in our best interest but we all find ways.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As I hit my teenage years my mental health status was at an all time low. I hated everything and every one. Nothing was ever right and happiness just wasn\u2019t something I did well. I was good at faking it though, when the time called for it. I discovered young that I wasn\u2019t like everyone else. My brain didn\u2019t work the same as everyone else\u2019s so sometimes faking it was something that just had to be done.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It wasn\u2019t just happiness I was bad at. I was just bad at feelings in general. I took everything in and it instantly turned to hate and anger. To be honest I was bad at most things that others seemed to handle with ease. I did my best to fake it to be more like those around me, never with much success. I soon was full of either rage or nothing all the time. It didn\u2019t matter what I did or who I was around nothing was okay and if I wasn\u2019t mad at the world I was empty and numb.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The first time I ever cut myself it was an accident. I was mad at someone for something and I was throwing things around my room. As I grabbed the scissors off the dresser and tossed them I cut my hand and it hurt. I paused.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It hurt. I felt something, something that wasn\u2019t nothing or unexplained rage. I was amazed at the stinging pain and the warm drops of blood that filled my palm and I sat down on the floor calm and relaxed. Two more feelings I hadn\u2019t felt in a long time. I just let the emotion take over and enjoyed every second of it while it lasted. As the pain started to subside so did the feelings.  \n\n\nRead more stories like this one at [brandyclear.com](https://brandyclear.com)", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I had approached a friend of mine at the time and told him that I might not particularly have an attraction to girls. Us both being from orthodox Indian families, the LGBT+ communities weren't particularly known to us so... I had to dig in to find out what meant what and in what context. I told him that I might be bisexual, he was excited with the idea after I explained it to him. I don't know if it was curiosity or whatever but he kept asking me more about the LGBT+ community wondering if he was part of it.\n\nIt was almost by the end of 8th grade when I told him and he was from the Muslim faith and I was Hindu. We decided to use a science project as a guise for him to drop by at my place, I wasn't particularly sure of why we needed to meet for this. When he came by, we both began watching pornography and... well... we had sex...\n\nIt was among the first time I've ever been with someone like this and... I seemed to enjoy it... but... he began to get addicted to the idea of it... I began getting calls so often I had to keep the telephone aside, keep my phone on mute and generally keeping him out... that was not enough... one day he came over and... he went through his way...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter this he didn't speak to me at all... I never got a chance to even ask if all of this was my fault or whether I even deserved to ask... I never told anyone about this and eventually... I realised I had no one to tell this to... I never had any true friends in that class, I was always the loner, and... he was the popular class comedian...\n\nHe gradually led on that I was... an object to be used... and that's when the bullying began...\n\nI am a bright student, both academically and in extra-curriculars... I was among the few to ever score a 100%, i think, in two fields in the CAT4 diagnostic test (spatial, non-verbal - 141). My verbal and quantative skills weren't far off either. I was categoried as a G&amp;T student (gifted and talented) and my skills in art were better than most students... I've been told I'm among the most intelligent and talented student, maybe even the most talented, but I've never really felt that way... I was always average to me...\n\nI guess it's because my parents aren't interested in me as much as my younger brother. They've never really been there when I needed them, and when I told them about what had happened... all I got was new set of nicknames ranging from 'eunuch' to 'prostitute' (in Malayalam of course)... I'm generally called an idiot in the house-hold, both my parents never really liked my artworks or my grades... it was just 'expected' of me to do all that... the insults I would receive for even making the tiniest of errors always stuck with me... if you were to ask me now, I could probably list every mistake I've made in the last year in chronological sequence. (I'm 16 right now)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the 9th grade, things got worse... it was the first time I never wanted to go home... I would generally try my best to find any reason to stay back at school, if I went home I would want to self-harm so bad... I began to stop eating breakfast in the morning and would refrain any contact with food or water from 6am - 3pm... I stopped drawing and sketching, I stopped smiling in general and I couldn't sleep at all..\n\nMy sleep schedule ranged anywhere from 11pm-4am, I barely got any sleep... I couldn't study even if I tried... every moment my mind was living it spent dwelling in the ideas of how separated and alone I am... I went from the class nerd to the near failure... the school had  to revoke the G&amp;T title and I was marked Average in 10th grade...\n\nI couldn't keep quiet about all this frustration and exhaustion... I didn't want to let anyone from my class or peers know about this inability to keep a straight face... so I looked for someone else in the area... I had already convinced my parents to get us a cat so I could my own mental wellbeing in control... but I didn't tell them of mentally broken I was...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got attached her so much and frankly of everyone in my home... she loved me the most... people tend to portray cats as assholistic fur-mats with claws, but... she genuinely loved me... she didn't care if I was a pathetic mistake of a human being, or if I didn't have the audacity to preserve my own rights, or even if I was to tear apart my own body for being a sack of shit... she just... cared for me...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAround this time... I met Dev, he was a year older than me and he was also questioning his sexuality... I thought if I bonded through a taboo link with someone I would have every reason to break them should they go against me... \n\n...i was so incredibly wrong...over the next 2 years, i was assaulted by him five times... the last one in January...this year...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finally came into the 10th grade after... being used thrice... I decided it was time I left this broken mind aside... I took on the persona of 'Krishari'... it's cringey for sure, but the idea of this new human being with an unlimited power set of being so incredibly strong and just... generally more prolific than me... made me feel satisfied with being alive...\n\nI switched the direction of my hair, became generally louder and more extroverted, read more books, painted more, sketched more, participated more, began writing, started taking French, Japanese and German at the same time... frankly, that kept exhausting me more and more... I stayed up late just trying to keep up with my hectic schedule, I couldn't even spare myself time to sleep for weeks... this went on for a few months and my mind stayed with a constant numbing pain, I still have it to date...\n\nI was so enraged with the idea that I couldn't do it that I began harming myself; I began using pumice stones on my chest and shoulders till they started to bleed... they're quite scarred now... and I only stopped this method in November...\n\nI kept going by this schedule like a burning firework, the start was bright... but I gradually began losing the flame...\n\nBy September, I was thoroughly exhausted, I couldn't do anything... the pain intensified and my head generally felt like an elephant took my brain for a trampoline... i was assaulted a 4th time... my dad was inside my home... just sitting there... when I walked in he didn't notice a thing... i managed to lock myself in the bathroom upstairs and tried to calm my mind...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn this time... I made a trustworthy friend... I call him Kenobi...\n\nHe was the first and probably the only person who knows that I'm playing a character all the time and... I've told him of how broken my mind really is... after the fourth one... my mind really lost its shit... I began seeing the world with more sharpened accuracy than I usually did, I could see people being torn apart in graphic detail... my mind showed me their heart beating... I honestly don't know what these moments were... but I called it 'Mania'... it seemed to be similar to how I manically start processing faster when I'm excited sometimes...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next 2 major examinations were evidence of how hard-work means nothing if you're not mentally fine... i digressed into the low-achiever's list of students and that just... broke me... nothing mattered anymore... here came my series of suicide attempts...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy November... I was numb to the world... I was prepared for everything to fall down and crash... and I was prepared to die at any instant... hoping in fact...\n\nMy parents convinced me to give away my cat... in the guise of moving to a new home, in November... I didn't even spare a moment to think otherwise... i just... posted an ad and waited for someone to take her away... I didn't cry when she left my home... i just... stood there and watched her scream in horror of being given away... *\"It'll be fine, she's an animal. Once they start feeding her, she'll get used to them.\"* my mother said... and damn it, i wont ever forget the look in my cat's eyes...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe night we gave her away, she tore open the arms of the new owners and ran away... i was devastated... how could i not realise i was loved? ...how could i throw it all away because some foul-mouthed bank accounts told me to...?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI became even more distant... I just... gave up on even trying to be hopeful... Kenobi... hated how low I'd gotten... he didn't like how I'd spend every other week just... disappearing... trying my best to get away from him... trying my best to... give him a life without me.... that kid made sure to make me feel human enough to stay...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was around January that... the last one happened... this time... i lost everything... my chastity was thrown out the window a while back... but... the guy from before took my first kiss... and that was the last thing keeping me going for love... Dev took everything...\n\nI lost everything... my friends... family... body... mind... all I had was a soul ripe for the taking...\n\nFebruary 10th, my 16th birthday came about and... my parents got us a white Persian kitten... she was relatively expensive and I couldn't really fight with them to take her back... she was an innocent little thing, softer than cotton...\n\nOn Feb 13th, 10:34 she fell from the shoe rack and died in front of me... I was back to that 'Mania'... no emotional thought... just robotic completion... i saw her gradually die before me... i couldnt even cry then...\n\nthe next morning began our study leave for the board examination... i cried... i couldnt control it... i just cried senseless...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI honestly don't know if I even have a chance at life anymore... im going to see a sheet of paper invalidating every drop of effort i've made into being alive... every moment spent surviving and thriving where humanity dies... im going to be shown how pathetically incompetent i am... because i never really mattered in the first place... i just... wanna tear my hands open so bad and just... die... the only thought keeping me from self-harming right now and kms is the idea that i might rip open Kenobi's heart... i cant do that to him... but what else can i do to stop my own shards from tearing me?", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I just want to vent/rant.\n\nMy mum first found out I was self-harming when I was 13. The first time she was very sympathetic and hugged me, and even though i didn't choose to tell her, she talked to me about it in private. She did make me show her my cuts which made me uncomfortable but I understand why. She also made me promise I'd stop, and told me the cuts weren't so bad so they shouldn't scar too badly. Which I know she meant well by, but it just made me feel pathetic, like I wasn't hurting myself right.\n\nAnyway, I didn't stop self-harming, and it got worse. I remember she confronted me at fifteen about it, and this time she was really mad and yelled at me and shook me. I just shut down when she asked me why I was doing it, and couldn't answer. She just screamed at me and kept asking me why and dragged me round the house by my arm. She also told me I had to tell my oldest sister, and sat me down next to the phone. I remember crying and my little sister asking me what was wrong but I couldn't tell her. I didn't phone my older sister and eventually my mum let me get up. She also told me she was going to be checking my arms in the future. \n\nWell i didn't stop cutting, I just started cutting on my shoulders and my hips. I remember my mum noticing some blood on my trousers when doing the washing and telling me that she knew what I was doing. \n\nI know that my mum reacted that way because she cares about me and was upset at what I was doing, and I know she probably was freaked out that I hadn't stopped self-harming and she knew I was drinking and making myself throw up. I know and I'm sorry I hurt her as her child for that, but I was in a really dark place back then. It's probably not fair but I'm still angry at her for reacting that way. \n\nShe's my foster mother not my biological mother, and I had/have a lot of trauma from my bio parents and my upbringing and I don't feel like she was really equipped to deal with my issues. I remember when she picked me up drunk from a party once I was crying and I admitted my bio mother used to sexually abuse me and my foster mum said she'd has suspicions about something like that. But even after telling her that she used to tell me that my bio mother loved me and arrange for me to have contact with her. \n\nI think she didn't take it seriously because the sexual abuse was by a woman not a man and because my bio mother is mentally ill, but that really fucked me and damaged my relationship with my foster mother.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I can't make up my own mind or take action. I can't even decide my own morals. I've been told what to do for so long. \n\nI barely have relationships with others because I am deathly afraid of rejection. I have never been in a relationship. My parents are growing not to be very fond of me. I think they see me as defective and useless too. My mother always seemed to believe the best in me, but lately, she seems to realize how pitiful I really am. And that's very depressing. My father's opinion hasn't changed. I've always been a failure to him since the day I was born. He made me into the shameful mess I am today. To him, I will always be just another whore. \n\nI have 2 friends. My closest friend is very kind, and she makes me feel like nothing else in the world matters. I'm not scared when I'm with her, I feel normal. But I worry about her. She's unhappy, she hides it, but I know. She's almost as alone as I am. I worry that one day she will realize I'm not worth it.\n\nThe second friend is someone I've know for years, since I was a small child and yet she feels like a stranger. We are all in our early twenties, and she's been an alcoholic for at least 4 years now. When I was in school with her, I was so jealous. She was a top student, she could play multiple instruments, and she seemed like the smartest person in the world to me. But when we graduated, she just ended up a person who spends most of her nights drinking and her primary socialization is bars. It feels like such a waste. You could look at me back when we were teens and see I was a mess, that I was hopeless. But she was the exact opposite. I have no idea what well of pain she's trying to drown with alcohol. And maybe that's why I'm a bad friend. I'm not there for either of them enough. I'm afraid both of them will abandon me. I'm afraid I'd they get to know me better, they will see I've only gotten worse. \n\nI cut my thigh up again. It hurt. I have a kitten that runs up my pant leg, and his little claws scratch my tender wounds. Its annoying. I cut it because I fought with my mother. She has a lot of health issues but refuses to go to a doctor. She says they don't help. We have all been to a lot of doctors. I suppose she is right somewhat. Doctors have let us down. But that doesn't mean they are useless. I talk her she should go see one about her ankle that's swelling. She complains every day about something on her body but doesnt attempt to treat it. I tell her this and we fight. She might have called me a bitch. Can't remember. She says she will leave and find a family that likes her. She threatens that at least once a week.\n\nIt upset me because me and my mom never fight. Its always her and me against my dad. I felt very bad about it and cried and cut my leg. I don't know if it actually made me feel better. All I know is that my thighs are gonna be fucked for swimming this summer.

I should feel guilty because people I love know, but no. I\u2019m sat here worried sick because my dog seems to know, and I hate that. He was sat in my armchair earlier, I\u2019d just got done cutting (I had to shower early, ages before dinner, and I had to go down to help mother pick a film for dinner later) so I went and sat on the sofa. He, as usual, came running over. He grabbed his toy and began thrusting it at me, continuously pushing it into my sore thigh. My mother isn\u2019t aware of my current relapse, but knows of my history. Though my relapse is suddenly becoming less temporary, which is slightly troubling but I\u2019m not too bothered about that right now. \n\nAnyway, I tell him no, because he\u2019s hurting me. He doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s hurting me, of course. I ended up whimpering slightly, and felt the cuts open back up (they were That fresh) and he noticed and began sniffing my thigh and attempting to lick the wounds. After that he stopped punching his toy into me, playing with it on his own alongside me instead, which is Very unlike him (he\u2019s a massive toddler; 78 kg, four years old and still acts like he\u2019s a tiny puppy). And then he just sat with me, for ages. He didn\u2019t leave my side until he got tired and fell asleep on the sofa. He\u2019s been nice. He\u2019s usually a bit of a knob (I wouldn\u2019t change him though; he gets a bit much but he means well). But not tonight. He was gentle and sweet and wouldn\u2019t leave me, but didn\u2019t bother me either. I feel bad. Really bad. He\u2019s seen me in this position before, two years back, when my mother was aware. I used to go and sit with him after I\u2019d hurt myself, or was on the verge of suicide. I didn\u2019t think he really understood what was going on. \n\nI still don\u2019t know if he\u2019s acting weird because he knows, or if he thinks he was the one that hurt me. Either way I feel bad. My other dog is ancient. She\u2019s fifteen, deaf, going blind, and has dementia. She thankfully doesn\u2019t seem to really be with things anymore. I wouldn\u2019t want to worry her. I grew up with her. I want her last years to be okay. The idea of my dog knowing is sickening to me right now. Even before he wasn\u2019t like this. Maybe he knows I\u2019m kind of alone in this. Only one person knows of my relapse, and she\u2019s ages away. In a different country. So she can\u2019t do anything, thankfully. I don\u2019t want people worrying over me. But him? That stings. Maybe he knows nobody knows, and wants to make sure I\u2019m okay. \n\nOr maybe he just wants a walk haha. We were too tired to take him today.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

The tissue damage that has been caused can progress very rapidly so you must rinse the area under cold running water for at least 10 minutes.\nDo not apply any creams, balms, oils, moisturisers or anything except cold running water.\nIf there is any clothing surrounding the burn please remove this by either taking it off or cutting it away; this also applies to removing constricting objects such as rings, watches, bracelets; just take it off. This is done because once tissue has been burned or damaged swelling of the area will follow; also the tissue can become sticky and attach to clothes or other things. IMPORTANT If there is anything that is already stuck to the burn, DO NOT remove it, this could make the situation worse.\nThe skin can also be burned when it is exposed to certain chemicals. If the chemical you have used is liquid, wash this off with lukewarm water for at least 30 minutes. If the chemical is dry, then brush the chemical off before rinsing the area in water. Please do not try and neutralise the chemical; if you have used an acid DO NOT try and reverse it by adding an alkali.\nAll chemical burns should be referred to a Doctor, either by attending your local Walk-in-Centre or the nearest A&amp;E Department.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Gender, age, sexual orientation, race, religion, background \u2013 they are all irrelevant. If, rather than considering who might turn to self-injury, we instead focus on who could possibly suffer from the emotional distress that can lead to self-injury, it\u2019s much easier to imagine that self-injury really can affect anyone.\nBeach\nSelf-injury is a coping mechanism. Anyone who has anything distressing to cope with might potentially turn to self-injury.\nSo instead of looking at who self-injures in terms of such things as gender and age, we might consider that there are certain characteristics that some people who self-injure share. These include, but are not restricted to, low self-esteem, perfectionism and high achievement, poor body image, trauma and abuse. Of course, a person who self-injures may experience all, some, or none of these characteristics, as may a person who doesn\u2019t self-injure.\nLow self-esteem\n\nMany people who self-injure often talk about intense negative feelings towards themselves. A significant cause of low self-esteem is chronic invalidation by others.\nPerfectionism and high achievement\n\nPerfectionists may be very successful in their every-day lives, but it often comes at a personal cost. Perfectionism simultaneously pushes people to succeed to the highest standards, but it also inevitably causes a person to feel they could have done better, or even that they have failed. Similarly to invalidation, this may lead eventually to low self-esteem.\nPoor body image\n\nSome people who self-injure have a poor body image. This may, again, be due to invalidation (i.e. consistent comments about weight, looks etc) or may even be due to the media\u2019s attention on the \u2018beautiful people\u2019. A person can feel inadequate, or even ugly or inferior. Self-injury may be a way of coping with these feelings by \u2018punishing\u2019 the body.\nTrauma and abuse\n\nSome people self-injure to cope with traumatic life events, either currently or in the past. These may include bereavement, bullying, break-up of relationship, financial crisis, or physical, emotional or sexual abuse.\nOther mental health issues\n\nSelf-injury may also be associated with mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, etc.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I\u2019ve tried to get therapy started twice but I couldn\u2019t ever address this issue and I\u2019ve always hated how I cried and couldn\u2019t ever admit to how serious my problems are. I\u2019ve always had this idea that if I did tell them about hurting myself there would be this permanent record of prejudice and insanity on me forever.\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone can truly like or appreciate unhappy or mad people, they just tolerate them. I would enjoy being left alone too, but I am scared of escalating the self harm. What can I do to cope, or say about my problems if I do seek therapy or treatment? What can I expect about what is going to be done to me? I need to weigh these reactions to know if it\u2019s worth it, to know that hurting yourself is a better mechanism than help.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

But after some thinking I went on I said \"I've been trying to stop self harming but its really hard\". I was hoping if I phrased it that way he wouldn't need to tell anyone.\n\nWe talked a bit and he said that I wasn't alone, and that I was brave and strong and that although I've had setbacks it's okay and that doesn't mean I've failed or anything. And he left lots of room for me to talk if I wanted to. On the one hand I felt like he was only saying those things to make me feel better or to stop crying but it really helped.\n\nThe conversation kind of gave me inspiration to be able to get through this and he kind of helped me make a plan. That if I ever had a bad day or anything I can text him and just say that I had a setback or whatever(no context or extra info needed) and he would pray for me and that I should keep trying to contact counselling. It feels good to know I'm not going through this alone.\n\nI also admitted that my main setback was the day of my baptism (in march) and that I felt bad about it but he said like that it was just a setback and theres lots of stressfullness leading up to the baptism and that was normal and that it was just a trigger and that I'm no less of a Christian because of it.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I piled up some advice and tips to keeping yourself safe and stopping self harm from becoming an addiction. I don\u2019t encourage ANY ONE at all, but if you have already started, this is what i can do.\nFeel free to comment down more tips and share feedback or stories!\n\n- Don\u2019t do it on a stupid place, know your habits and clothing choices. Ask yourself where you are most comfortable having scars.\n- Be conscious of the harm you are doing and its possible severity. Keep yourself safe.\n- There will be permanent marks in a lot of cases (depends on method), be aware of that.\n-Please, please, do try to talk to someone about it, or get help. It can be super scary, but it could go very wrong if you are struggling through hard times alone.\n- Remember that you don\u2019t need to be ashamed of your scars.\n- Keep each session responsable (be conscious, don\u2019t do it too much).\n- (If you use any) Clean your tools before and after.\n- (Optional) Have someone you trust know, so you can contact them when you need it.\n- Only do it when you feel entirely sure about it.\n- Always think thoroughly before you decide to do it.\n- (Optional) Challenge yourself to long periods of being clean.\n- Have a support system, someone you know or a safe community, family members, teachers, etc. (An example could be this Reddit community)\n- Know how to treat your injuries, whether it gets out of hand or not. Always wash open wounds, and run cold water in burns. Have bandaids and gauzes in hand.\n- If you don\u2019t wanna do it, but have a strong urge, try to avoid it as much as you can. Look up things to do when you have urges, message someone you trust (you don\u2019t necessarily have to talk about your struggles). Distract yourself, meditate or rest/sleep. Watch something on tv. Occupy yourself, do some work, clean your space.\n\nIf you have anymore please comment them down, you could help a lot of people.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Just I can't do anything so... You can call me a liar and hate me I guess a bunch of my friends already do. If the mods mod here as well... I... Great just fucking ban me you know, I've tried everything you sick bullying evil awful just sick people. You're bullies. You'll always be bullies just like everybody else who hurts people. Because you like feeling powerful. I hope one day it stops feeling so good and the people you've hurt start to make you feel bad.\n\nI talked about drugs on the discord. I'm addicted to amphetamines. And also coke and some opiates.. but this post was about ephedra. In the Eating disorder safe space I called it 'brain candy' in a long post about how I'd relapsed and was about to crash on stimulants. The mod deleted my post without telling me. I started getting really anxious because I got gaslighted a bunch as a kid as a part of the abuse and rape stuff and now I have trouble separating what is real and what I've thought up so I was like \"can someone tell me if my post was deleted I'm super freaked out\" (I don't have the exact words I said I'm trying to go off memory but everything is deleted so only the mods have the logs).\n\n- mod said it was one of the team members and if I felt strongly I should DM not air 'dirty laundry' in public.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- I said I wasn't comfortable with that and didn't like how they were acting and how it wasn't fair to delete stuff without telling people because a lot of people have trouble with gaslighting in their histories.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- mod came in yelling at me for saying I'd said she was gaslighting. I said I wasn't saying that and that I didn't think that. Mod said I was glorifying drugs and 'trying to trigger people to relapse' I said that wasn't fair and that I would never want that for anyone.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- mod said to be quiet and stop talking and that 'literally every other mod agrees with me' I said that was bullying. Because it is.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- Mod muted me and I said I was sorry multiple times in the intro channel.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- Mod forbid access and allowed access only to a channel called \"jail\" I said that was really insensitive and triggering and humiliating to even call it that when muting people for talking about sex work and drug addiction.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- All the mods chimed in saying what I'd done wrong and how I was upsetting them and how it would be better if I left and 'even the neutral mod thinks you should leave' I said they didn't care about triggers or safe spaces or helping people or being moderators they were just abusing power.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- They banned me, I relapsed on cutting hard. They made a long announcement about how I was being abusive to the mod team and a lot of friends from discord were asking me if that was true and now I've lost a bunch of friends who cut because they think I'm evil.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- I went back to the main pics website and made a post about what happened. I said I hoped we could talk about stuff together and work things out because I didn't want for any of this stuff to happen and if people could calm down and talk it would really help. And that I was sorry for upsetting the mods and hurting people's feelings. Other users were also posting about how the mods had made them uncomfortable in the past.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- They banned me for 3000 years. With the reason listed as: gaslighting.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- I made a new account begging them and apologising for everything and saying I wasn't a threat and that all my recovery stuff and pictures and posts were there and how they could at least give me access to get those back.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- They banned me again for another 3000 years. Saying I was avoiding the ban.\n\n\nSo that was my whole support network. And a lot of my friends who self harm. It had all of my pictures I posted to try and make myself feel better. I didn't save them anywhere. It had my pictures of my drawings on my arm. And my drawings on paper. And even a stupid poem I wrote that people really liked and said it helped them but now that's gone too. They didn't even ban anyone else for like saying they were backstabbing or scum and I never even said anything personal at all.\n\nIt sounds stupid to be upset about but I'm in a rape relationship with a long term pimp while doing underage sex work and getting really fucked up on drugs to cope and stay thin and everytime I self harm he beats the shit out of me or make me do group work which I hate so much and all I have is this stupid phone that I'm too scared to even save pictures on of my own self harm or any of the stuff I write or make to try and stop myself from cutting. I just want that stuff back if anyone can still access it or knows a mod who can help me just ... Please..\n\nCan someone just please just talk to me I'm so fucking alone. I don't have anything or anyone. I'm killing myself with these cuts and they're just getting worse and if he finds out what I did he'll probably kill me anyway.\n\n**Tl;dr:** I lost all the stuff I had. And all the stuff I had was a few internet friends and some stupid pictures. But that's what I had.I'm going to die alone at 16 and high while probably being raped by someone I hate. I know that.

It\u2019s weird that I want to harm myself but not kill myself. My own boyfriend helps me financially and that is what bringing down our relationship. He told me last night \u201cyou need to start caring about our relationship instead of yourself\u201d and that hurt me because I would give my last dime to someone who really cared about me as I did to them. I would go to restaurants with him and spend my last couple dollars just to have a nice date with him. I know I have PTSD. I have never went to a doctor for it but at the age of 5 I was molested by my cousin that was a girl for three years. (Kept that secret until I was 21) when I was 9 I was molested by my dads BFF who lived right across from him. He would have raped me but I kneed him in the chest and ran. Didn\u2019t go to court until months later and when I did he got non guilty. At the age of 13 I get bullied by my whole class. They start calling me a owl and making pictures of one saying I had really big eyes.. then at the end of that year I was diagnosed as dyslexia. But the only reason I had trouble in class was because of the bullying. I hit 8th grade and my friends that were guys start to harass me. I was wearing skinny jeans and a tight shirt. I\u2019m in class and they start to poke at my butt or boobs and I got really upset and told the principal.. they get kicked out of school and I tell my mom and she blames me because of what I wore. The day after this kid that I knew comes up to me and says let me see your arm .. and I did without even thinking and he used a sharpener blade and slides it across my arm.. I\u2019m bleeding pretty bad and he tells me. Just say you got scratched by a cat. I go to the principal again and that kid gets kicked out and my mom said it\u2019s my fault. I start to talk to random men online at the age of 12-20 on a site called my yearbook because I felt alone and I would fake who I was so nobody could see me. Over time I had a personality disorder where I would tell everyone I met I was from a different country and used a accent. At the age of 18 my mom finds a hicky on my neck. She calls my stepdad and he comes in grabs my hair and almost punches me in the face. I tell my mom I\u2019m going to leave.  She calls my real dad and he tells my step dad he would have done the exact same thing. So I go to a guys house that I only talked to for one day and him and I get into a abusive relationship pretty fast.

From the perspective of someone who began self-harming because I was an impressionable 7th grader that was depressed and saw people on the internet talking about cutting like this tragically beautiful thing, it seems so toxic to portray it like this.\n\nThis same author also talked about the classic, 'someone self harms until they find a bf/gf and then their romantic partner kisses their scars and they never feel sad again,' which is bullshit and makes me so angry. Self-injury is a mental illness and real struggle for a lot of people, and to see someone treat it like another cheap way to write angst makes me really sad. \n\nIt isn't healthy to treat depression and self-harm like a fiction trope instead of a real issue. Most art portraying self-harm feels stale and fake unless it was made or inspired by someone who had issues with self-harm, or someone close to them struggled with it.

I'm really self conscious about the stuff I did back then, and for years ive been trying to fix myself. Honestly I started cutting to help find that way. After I got home I was just kinda dull. I've been using the same piece of glass for 4 months, and just decided I need sharper,,because of today. So I went to target to buy a glass bottle. I broke it, and found a really sharp piece. I cut my finger to test it out and ive never bled so much before from such a tiny cut. I loved it. Also today was the 4th month since I broke up with my girlfriend. She broke up with me when she found out I was cutting. Honestly I just want to get to summer vacation so I can improve myself better. I got my first job, which is good (I'm a freshman in high school btw) and ive set a goal to get back In shape. But I'm still scared because my cutting has gotten out of control.

I'm reposting this to two other subreddits (in case you've already seen this) - also going to keep this as vague as possible for personal reasons\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, for a bit of backstory I have SHed in the past, it's always been a way for me to calm myself and let myself know that I can still feel something. recently I moved in with my distant family as mine had passed away after our house burned down (with my mom dad and siblings inside - all while I'm at school). recently I joined a school team to \"get back out there\", all is going well and then life's just like: TA-DA! here's a tournament. Now I know I'm not the best at sports or anything (at all) but I'm really good at this one (first year on an official school team) and I'm playing doubles with this one girl - we're one of the best teams in the league. (now I've always been horrible at keeping relationships, both romantic and platonic) So I get this brilliant idea that when we qualify for the championships I'll ask her out because you know, I really like her. Everything's going well until we face these two teams - both absolutely f\\*cking decimated us. So at this point we're 3 - 2 out of 6 (as a few teams couldn't make it). It all comes down to this last game, we lose it (OFC!) by five points. Throughout the tournament my gameplay had been... well horrible to say the least, I kept letting my emotions get the better of me and cause me to either choke up or hit horrible plays, all resulting in us losing a few points (note; because of me) So come the time for the best teams to advance - we miss out to the team we just lost against by 3 points. 3 F\\*CKING POINTS!!! (most games were a 20 - 30 point difference) And these guys were no better than us! This is all my fault. had I just played strategically as opposed to emotionally we would have made it... but no, I decide to ruin our chances. but the night just gets worse from there - firstly I was asking a friend to do me a favor (won't get into detail) in exchange for some pop, money, etc (P.S. no - not drugs) and low and behold my family who is taking care of me finds out, now I'm 100% grounded - no hanging out with friends, phone, etc. can't even go to after team meetings. I let her down, I let my team down, I let my school down, I let my family down, I let my very few \"friends\" down, I let myself down. I'll probably never get to ask her out now, ... not that she'd ever date someone like me. (she's a grade below me and I hardly see her as it is) nor play on a sports team again (although I'm being asked to play again next year)...

They weren't saying it in jest, but they were very much serious. And that the fat in our brains makes us not be able to tell we're overweight or something. \n\nNow that second one sounds like bullshit but I have heard the idea that being overweight affects your memory elsewhere.

There was a rule to show wounds after you had self harmed. I didnt follow that rule in the beginning because I was ashamed. Then they said I had to or I would have to leave that specific ward. So I started showing them wounds but always a bit later so it couldnt be stitched up anymore, they began telling me to come earlier because my wounds \"required stitches and were deep\" which I didnt really see the same way. One time I did show them in the 24h window and the nurse told me I had to go get it stitched up, I disputed this, so she involved a doctor who told me: \"I literally can see your fat, Sir, this is not up for discussion\".\n\n\nNow that I'm like half a year clean (don't know when exactly I self harmed last) I'm seeing how bad that perspective was. I didn't see anymore that this was something to fight against and not something to accept. I didn't see how bad my self harm was (and even if you don't cut as deep as I did, it's still fucking bad). I feel like some communities on the internet can make you feel even more like it's normal, I don't know though, because I never was part of those.\n\n\nPlease please please just think about what you're doing to yourself. I'm not talking about the scars looking bad, I'm talking about literally not feeling worthy enough to stop slicing up your body.\nYes, you will feel urges. No, it won't be easy. But try to do it less and less. At my worst I was self harming two times a day while in the closed mental health ward. Of course I didnt go from that directly to not doing it at all anymore.

In the beginning this was one of my main skills along with ammonia smelling sticks. With both of these I don't know the brand names in other countries, I live in germany.\n\n\nThe skill is basically a cream you put on your skin in quite a thick layer. After around 15-30 minutes it starts to burn. This distracts you from the urge to self harm quite strongly, as you already have a sensation where you want to cut. The active ingredients in this cream/gel are *nonivamid* and *nicoboxil*, in germany the brand name is \"Finalgon\".\nI always buy the extra strong one, the strong one also works, with the normal one I'm not sure.\n\n\nTake caution! Always wash your hands after applying (even better is not touching the cream with your hands at all) and cover the place where you applied the cream. This stuff can get very uncomfortable when it gets in contact with your eyes, mouth, nose or genitalia (no I didnt try this on myself, but I did accidentally put some on my lips and it wasnt nice).\n\n\n\n*TLDR: Apply a cream with the ingredients of nicoboxil and nonivamid (more important one if you cant find them combined)(called \"Finalgon\" in germany) to your skin, this will make it burn which releases some of the urge to self harm.

I know this isn\u2019t good, but I\u2019ve just felt the need to punish myself, and also I\u2019m trying really hard to get really skinny for my school over night trip to Philadelphia (May 28) even though it\u2019s not a good way to lose weight. Ik that but I just need to lose this weight quickly and this is the easy, fastest way. \n\nEvery time I cut I have to think more about where to place my cuts since it\u2019s almost summer. I\u2019ve never really cut on my wrists besides two small small cuts a week or so ago that barely show, so I\u2019ll be fine with my arms, but I like cutting on my ankles and my upper thighs but I love swimming so I won\u2019t be able to hide those well at all.

However, I think that most people would agree, myself included that this would not be classified as an act of self harm.\n\nBut then here is where I am not sure about. There are actions which I know are harmful for myself but I do it for reasons which are not with the intent of self harming. I don't keep a record of this because it happens numerous times a day and often doesn't actually cause much harm. This is what I have historically classified as a \"face palm\" kind of action, other than using something which may be slightly harder than my hand and carries a greater moment. This I never classified as an act of self-harm until because I never intended to be such an act but now I have managed to bruise my forehead by taking such actions and it got me thinking, granted in a semi-dizzy while trying to keep myself sitting straight.\n\nIt is just that such an action made me wonder whether committing actions which you know harm you but aren't done with the intention of self harming you is actually a form of self harm.\n\nSorry for such an odd and poorly worded question.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Before we get into some tips, there's something very important. \n\n**Always make sure your open wounds are covered. Especially important for burns. Never put makeup or other beauty product on open or healing cuts.**\n\nNow onto some tips!\n\n**Concealing Scars**\n\nA good way to conceal scars is with makeup. If your scars are reddish, a green concealer will help mute the color. [This palette ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0061KQEVW/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_8dO1Cb0JDAJH0) includes a few shades and a green shade that will help conceal redder scars. \n\nAnother hugely effective tool is *tattoo concealer*. As name suggests, it's used to completely cover up tattoos, and is very useful for covering scars. \n\nIf you have any open or healing cuts, you can still use makeup on them *as long as you first put on a bandage that is closed on all sides and make sure they are fully covered so no makeup can get in them.* Bandaids with the pads in the middle with the sticky part surrounding it are good for this, and bigger bandages with the pad in the middle are even better. \n\n**Hiding Cuts and Scars for swimming/hot weather**\n\n*Arms*\n\nIf your cuts are on your wrists, wrist sweatbands and bracelets can help hide them. Another thing is a wrist brace or wrap, which can easily be explained with a stiff wrist or carpal tunnel. If your cuts are on your arms, there are light long sleeved cardigans or light jackets (denim is always good, plus it stays relatively cool sometimes). For swimming, there are plenty of long sleeved swimsuits available, and there are some [here](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=long+sleeve+swimsuit&amp;ref=is_s). \n\n\n*Legs*\n\nFor your ankles, hiding cuts is relatively easy with socks or boots. If you have cuts on your calves, some capris can cover them, or pants that come a little higher off the ankles. If they're on your thighs, longer skirts or longer shorts can cover them. *Long shorts can be cute as hell and don't let anyone tell you otherwise!!* For swimming, you have a few options. For cuts down on your legs, some long swim pants are available, and full one piece swimsuits are also available. Some examples are [here](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=surfing+swimsuits+long&amp;ref=is_s) and [here](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=swim+pants+for+women&amp;sprefix=swim+pants&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_10). If you have cuts on your ankles or feet that pants don't cover, swim shoes can help, plus protect your feet from getting sandy or cut by rocks if you're on the beach. Thighs have a few more options. Swim shorts are out there for women, and you can never go wrong with trunks. Another really good option are [swim skirts and dresses](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=swimsuit+skirt&amp;ref=is_s). They're usually longer and cover most of your thighs.\n\nFeel free to post any other tips you have in here, too! I hope I could help someone this season.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I started mumbling shit about how I'm an idiot and want to kill myself and my teacher hears it and tells me to see him after class. Keep in mind that I am TERRIFIED of this guy. \n\n\nSo I meet him after class, and at this point I'm trembling and seriously considering just leaving and hauling ass to chorus. He tells me that what I was saying concerned him and that he has to \"test if I'm a self-harmer\" or something like that. So, he takes out a needle and rolls my sleeve up, revealing my (clean) arm. He then begins scratching my wrist until it bleeds, which hurts like hell mostly because I don't cut on my arms. At this point I can only assume that the \"test\" is to see if I react like a non-self-harmer would to that pain, wincing and looking away instead of enjoying it or something. I dunno, it's stupid.\n\nSo then, he moves on to my legs. I'm VERY uncomfortable, because there's about to be a grown man touching my thighs, but I grin and bear it. I look away, and he kind of makes an \"uh-huh\" sound when he sees my scars. A minute later, he says I'm done and I assume he didn't even do the needle test because he saw my scars and fresh cuts.\n\n...then I look at my thighs and see a bleeding cut on each of them. I didn't feel it at all. I guess my brain thought I was so used to it that I wouldn't feel it. I then get this overwhelming sense of dread before waking up. \n\n\n\nSo, there.

So they eventually let me go.\n\nI still struggle a lot with my urges to self harm and even go trough days, weeks, months in which my eating disorders creeps back up and i eat little to none. I feel miserable a lot of the times, but i have the feeling like nobody really cares.

I'm gonna try to avoid my own personal BS that led up to it all, because I'm not sure it matters for this sub or that talking about it is helping me in anyway. I've struggled since I was 12 so well over a decade now. I never took it too serious though. Cutting the arm at 12, definitely was a cry for help I didn't try to hard to hide it. Even showed some people. School found out, stopped for a while. At 16 cut the thigh- no one could find out. Grew out of it myself with support from close friends, parents never knew or anything. Have amazing parents, had a great childhood, I've just always been a bit like melancholy or something. Nbd. So 18 or so I start fighting- you know those kids looking for a fight and going at it like they have absolutely no fear. Eventually I got in enough shitty situations and finally matured enough to realize that violence is never the answer and also that often innocent people are the ones who get hurt not the ones who want to be hurt or the \"bad\" people. Maybe fighting and this next one aren't your typical self harm, but for me its always sort of felt the same... The next one was punching walls. Until I broke my hand very badly- surgery, pins and all this. So I mostly have stopped doing that... However the current one.. it scares me the most of them all. I have never been suicidal, but I now self harm by hitting myself or clawing at myself. Its scary because I really am trying to stop. I want to be healthy and calm and not do this. But the urge to hurt myself is so strong... my thoughts get so insane like I just want to absolutely rip my skin off or break my own jaw or face bones or slam my head into the wall. I am usually able to stop this- primarily however with thoughts that should I leave a mark bad enough or be injured seriously enough, I could be hospitalized. Or people in work will ask questions. Or when I lived at home that my parents would see and we are very close as well as they know my history, so my cover story would be less likely to work. I felt so bad after yesterday- just a couple punches and some very minor scratches that barely scabbed- but two on my face which is annoying because I feel much less heavy today but looking in the mirror gives me that sinking reminder.... But yeah I felt so bad and scared yesterday I almost called the Samaritans. But I'm scared the way I want to talk they may try to find me and hospitalize me. This would be very bad for me at this time for various reasons. I'm not going to seriously hurt myself, I think my self control is pretty good. Hopefully is goes without saying but I would definitely never kill myself, or hurt anyone else. I just don't know why I am doing this again. I worry it is linked to when I am in love. I think I may have mild PTSD from past relationships and I really thought I had worked past it- but yesterday really scared me. Maybe I am not mentally healthy enough for a relationship? Sometimes I think I should be alone forever simply because I seem to do quite well when I'm alone. Anyway I'm just here to talk and to vent and also if anyone else needs someone to talk to- especially if you have similar self harm behaviors... well I'm here. Good luck everybody, I know we are all able to be okay if we try hard enough I think and help each other.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Especially because her dad had taken her to get hospitalized right after I told him and hospitalization isn\u2019t going to do anything. Hospitalization only works if you\u2019re actively suicidal.\n\nLike he didn\u2019t even ask her about it, he just immediately took her there without asking about her feelings. I was extremely pissed at him because he told her that I told him. Like you can\u2019t just automatically think your child is crazy for wanting to harm themselves! That\u2019s just going to hurt their trust in you. She ended up not getting admitted because she straight up lied and said she did it for attention.\n\nBut the thing is, if I tell on her she\u2019s probably going to tell my dad my deepest secret that I\u2019ve had for years way before I even knew her, and she just found out about it recently.\n\nBut at the same time, I feel that she wants people to care about her because she doesn\u2019t care for herself. She won\u2019t admit it, but when I asked her if she cared if anyone found out (because she wears short sleeves) she said no because they don\u2019t notice it or just ignore it.\n\nShe\u2019s also 17, about to turn 18 in October of 2019 and I\u2019m afraid she feels like nobody is going to care about her anymore once she\u2019s an adult. Her older sister is 19 and has been treated differently since she turned 18, but I don\u2019t think my friend knows that she\u2019s the exact opposite of her sister and that I highly doubt her father will treat her any differently.\n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do, I need help because I deeply care about her and I\u2019m just stressed.

Well now I noticed I am becoming more sad every day and feeling like shit and wanting to die whenever im conscious. I think this all started last year around summer where i started to get these suicidal thoughts and stuff. The last like 6-8 months have been really shit and I dont even know how Im still alive tbh. And for a long time now I've been googling stuff like \"i feel like shit and i want to die\" \"i hate myself\" or \"what can i use to cut myself\". Now to my original thought about making this post, I've noticed, that there are these articles from newspapers and idk any shitty news things, that i dont even know who they are writing these for(for me appreantly lmao), which mostly mention women suffering and stuff. I only remember finding 1 article or post on one of these kind of websites on which a guy has just told you how he was become suicidal out of nowhere and shit. Tbh i feel kind of weird about it, cuz this makes me think like im weak? I mean I already am a skinny weak piece of shit on the outside and now im weak on the inside too? Idk why but i started selfharming like 2-3 months ago which started by just scratching my wrist with my nails to try to make it bleed. Now im using my compasses(if thats the right word, idk, this thing that you use in school to draw perfect circles with) and im starting to push it down even more day by day. And just thinking about like, why isnt any male going through this shit, am i just a fucking pussy, was i intended to be a female? I mean Im not gay but honestly i'd suck a dick just to cuddle with that guy after because im so fucking lonely. Im sitting at home all day, and i hate it, Im really weird in social situations and i cant make any friends. And my current \"friends\", i feel like dont really like me and it feels like im just following them around because i dont have anyone else. I dont really have anyone to talk to and if i wouldnt talk to anyone tbh, cuz just thinking about it makes me think i just want attention. Okay at this point idk where this shit is going anymore, i think i really just want attention, but only online tho lmaoooooo. Anyways to go back to that woman thing, am I the only one feeling like this? Or am I truly just completely useless and weak. I really dont know anymore, sorry if this post feels like me just flaming and crying about my shit while you all truly have it worse if i just read through this sub, i guess i truly am just a pussy 4Shrug", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Then this weekend happens.\n\nSaturday I have a full blown panic attack during a small arguement with my boyfriend. When it becomes obvious that this isn't fake he starts to try and calm me down and help me through it (this is the first panic attack I've had around him in our 4 months of dating so it's not something he had to deal with before, thus the first idea being maybe it was fake). It was rough for the rest of the day/evening with emotions doing rollercoasters for me.\n\nToday was ok but for some reason the Mother's Day stuff really got to me and I started feeling depressed. Not too serious, but by the afternoon I had a full breakdown, was ready to try suicide, and then my boyfriend called me and calmed me down. Later that day my emotions dipped super low again and I ended up cutting several times in different spots. My roommate found out and called my parents.\n\nI was already planning on calling off work for a mental health day to recover from the weekend and just relax with my boyfriend. Now my parents are wanting me to visit them tomirrow because they are worried about me and my self harm.

{"post_id": "bnyl4g", "created_utc": 1557720120, "title": "Years later", "author": "looogaaaaaan", "self_text": "Last Friday, I had a bad night. \n\nHere\u2019s a back ground story first;\n\nSince I was 12 I\u2019ve dealt with depression and anxiety. Only then, it got worse. I got bullied, my life threatened, several texts a day telling me how bad of a person I was, and the worst thing I did was believe them. \n\nUntil I felt so much pain one day, I had to let it out. I\u2019ve never even thought about harming myself before, but I truly believed I was all the things those girls said to me. I self harmed for the first time. \n\nThis went on throughout high school. I\u2019d have bandages always on my wrists, hidden by watches or lots of those I Love Boobies bracelets that were so popular at the time. And when my mother started noticing them, I blamed it on the dog and started harming on my hips. \n\nA close friend of mine approached me, she knew I was dealing with depression and genuinely asked me if I was okay. I broke down in the school gym and I told her everything. She told me that she self harmed as well. Later in the school year, she got clean and I was inspired to do so as well. May 30th 2014 I was clean for almost five years. \nAlmost. \n\nLast Friday, was a rough day for me. All this week I see people my age graduating college and moving onto better things. I, however, took a semester off to deal with health issues and will not be graduating on time. My grandfather messaged me asking how college was going, when he found out I took a semester off, he asked me if I was giving up on my future. \n\nSo I began to think...am I giving up on my future? I overthought about it, decided to drink to relax myself, get sleepy, and put my sadness to bed. \n\nBig mistake. I became reckless, I felt destructive. I wondered why I was here and why I had people who loved me when I was a failure. I picked a fight with my boyfriend, pushing him away, annoying him. I stopped answering him, he FaceTimed me, I was beyond drunk by then. And I placed a pair of scissors to my wrist. \n\nI told my boyfriend I wouldn\u2019t bother him anymore. He\u2019s screaming at me to get help. But all I could do was stumble into the bathroom and fall on the floor. I started crying and crying, I hung up on my boyfriend, he kept calling and calling. I began throwing up on the bath mat that I had. I couldn\u2019t move, I was well choking on my vomit. \n\nMy mom ran into the bathroom and freaked out. She lifts me out of my vomit and balls up the mat. My boyfriend keeps calling, my mom keeps hanging up while I\u2019m blacking out. \n\nThen I feel my boyfriends hands lifted me up from the ground. He helped me pee along with my mom. Sadly, I was on my period and whipped the tampon outta no where, throwing it into the trash can beside my boyfriend. They pulled me into my room, I insisted on laying on the floor. I was crying still and kicking my feet back and forth, at some point I hit my toe on something and bruised it badly. \n\nThey finally convinced me, after another pew break, that I needed to lay down in my bed. I felt them begin to leave or move away from my bed and I began crying again. I threw up once more into my trash can in my room, and cried for my boyfriend to hold me. I repeated myself over and over, I wanted him to hold me. He handed me the teddy bear that he got me and talked to me until I was quiet. He sat on my chair in my room watching me for hours, even falling asleep in it. \n\nI hit rock bottom, hard. And the point of me even posting this is to tell people that it gets better and that people TRULY love you. I didn\u2019t expect my boyfriend to stay, there is much more that I cannot even type because I blacked out, but it was a rough night. I didn\u2019t expect my mother to take care of me, I had it in my head that we were always at odds with each other and that I didn\u2019t matter. \n\nBut you do matter. You are beautiful and wonderful and people NEED you to stay alive and well. I know that it gets hard, believe me, I do, but whoever is actually reading my long post - IT GETS BETTER even when it doesn\u2019t seem like it. It took a bad night like Friday for me to actually begin to take care of myself. Please take care of yourselves, this month is mental health awareness month, so become aware of yours! Be in tune with your body, get help! I\u2019m always open to talk to anyone that needs it, even share some things that I\u2019ve learned in therapy. It\u2019s worth a shot. \n\nI love you guys, keep being warriors and finding the strength to keep going!", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I never did any deep cuts except one on my right forearm, which I did more than a half year ago, and it's still pink and pretty much visible. The rest of my scars is white and thin and they're on my left arm. Many times while cutting I was thinking that the cuts and scars look cool anyway so I never really cared about them. \n\nMy boyfriend has been a friend of mine for almost three years and we've been dating since 5 months. Everything is cool - he keeps complementing me and I feel appreciated. He knows I cut myself and he multiple times told me to stop and said I can always talk with him if I have a problem, if I want to do it again, he worries and wants to support me.\n\nBut sometimes he would mention that I have scars. And that they're not pretty. He would always do it delicate so I didn't mind that much, but it still hurt. He would grab my arm and be like \"not cool\". Today he was telling me how much he likes the way I look and said that there's this one, thing he doesn't like. And he meant my scars. I told him that I know I'M HAVING THEM and I know they aren't the best thing in the world but still they're a part of me and I don't want anyone to remind me about them. All he said was simply \"but this is not looking nice\" I was like \"I know, can't rewind the time\" and he just said \"okay\" so I guess he won't talk about it anymore. \n\n\nNow I feel bad about having them, I feel like I should be like the girl he dated before, she would never do such things. I feel like I'm stupid and I'm overreacting just to make everything a reason to cut. Although I'm trying to stop it, I can't undo my scars. I feel so ugly with them now. \nJust had to say that somewhere.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

My mom asked me to help her with cooking, and i still agreed. I was just so tired that I've done it a little poorly. When I finished, I watched TV for a while. Mom started to ramble about my laziness, because i want to do literally no housework, and that girls have to know those stuff. At that time i was too tired to argue with her anything, so i just quietly went upstair, and rested a little. When our family was having lunch, she brought up my laziness. Then she told me that everytime I was upset, angry about something, I would cut my arms, my legs, and that everybody knew it. She said everybody could destroy their body like me, and I was not something special for knowing how to cut, even the dude with Down syndrome (living in our neighbourhood) could also hold a knife and create a perfect cut on his arm. And she felt like all I did was just a \"revenge\" to her. She joked that I would surely cut myself after this, and turned 360 degree to \"Don't cut yourself anymore\"\n\nNo shit what the fuck? \n\nThey (my family) is the reason why I cut myself too much, I just want to let things pass because physical pain is easier to deal with than emotional pain.

They gave me pills for the 3 days and i called them today to find out what's going on.\n\nI first called my original therapist to see if my appointment with her was still open. They said I've been discharged because I'm now under the crisis teams care. Cool, I'm fine with that.\n\nI call the crisis team, tell them I've finished my course, I'm not feeling any better, what do I do? They told me that they will book an appointment for me, next month. I said I can't wait a month. I'm suicidal, can't keep myself safe, I was under the impression that I'd be seen this week. Nope sorry, the earliest we have is next month.\n\nI call 111 (non emergency NHS number) for advice, I cry for half hour down the phone, tell them I can't wait that long, I can barely function now, god knows how I'll be in a months time, if I can keep myself safe that long! They tell me to go straight to the hospital. My mum had the car so I had to tell her to take me. I had to tell her I'm suicidal, I've been hiding everything from her so I don't upset her.\n\nI spent 4 hours in hospital, I spoke to 2 psychologists, they both agreed that I've been treated shit. I got given a promise that I'll get the help I need, all I have to do is keep myself safe for 1 more day. I got a call, not 10 minutes, after I got home booking an appointment to see someone tomorrow. The kicker? It's at the place that said there is no appointments for a month. So they bare faced lied to me earlier this morning!\n\nI'm fuming! They knew where I was mentally, they knew I was suicidal, but they still wanted me to wait a month!!

He told me a mutual friend encouraged him to go seek professional help for his mental health and it was helping slowly.\nHowever he has lost a lot of weight in a short period of time.

I guess it started about a year ago when I briefly picked up smoking, but when my partner and I moved in together I had to quit so they wouldn't find out about it. At the time that felt like \"self harm\", I think that was why I was doing it (as opposed to the other reasons folks pick up smoking). Anyway, the other night I had a bunch of pent up negative energy and self hate that I couldn't get out any other way, so I decided I would cut my inner thigh a few times. I've been doing it semi-regularly since, and I'm afraid of how this is going to affect things like my ability to be intimate with my partner without them finding the wounds/scars. I don't really want to stop, even though I know it's bad for me, it's not how I plan on living forever, it feels like something that's just getting me by for the time being, but it's still something that I know will have adverse effects on the near future, if not the rest of my life if it persists even for a while. Not really sure what my point of writing this is. Guess I just needed to get my story straight with myself to clear my head a bit. Thanks.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

So I have been self harming since some point in middle school (I recently graduated high school now.) My friends and family knew, as did my therapist. For a while we all just knew I was doing it and I kept doing it and there were a few incidents where my parents caught me and got upset. Eventually I just decided to hide it. Every time my parents or therapist asked me if I had self harmed I would lie and say no. After a while, they stopped asking. I'm assuming they think that I have stopped since I basically told them I stopped. My friends also assumed I stopped so I'm kind of stuck in this place (that I, admittedly, put myself into) where I'm still self harming but am to ashamed to tell anyone. This leads me into my second problem which is that I have absolutely no motivation to stop. I am truly apathetic about it. I feel guilty for lying to my friends/family/therapist, but otherwise I really don't care that I'm hurting myself. I feel like, this way, it really doesn't affect anyone but me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, what is some motivation to stop self harming that doesn't revolve around other people? My main motivation is just not wanting anyone to find out and confront me and that hasn't made me stop, it just made me hide it better.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

These posts break my heart because I too had a moment like this. I started self harming when I was as young as 8 or 9. It wasn\u2019t much. Digging my fingernails into arms and hands when I was being yelled at was the only method of self harm I engaged in, until 9th grade. I was struggling with anorexia and no one knew. I was so alone and had no one to talk to about what I was going through. Being in that dark place, I decided to return to my original method of self destruction. It was around this time that I started taking it further. I would take sewing needles and repeatedly stab them into my upper right arm until I saw dots of blood. I knew I had a problem. I recently found a letter I wrote, to no one in particular, outlining all of my current issues. In that letter I talked my eating disorder but also about how I was worried the whole \u201cself harm\u201d thing was going to escalate. Even knowing how terrible my new habits could become, I still didn\u2019t seek help or tell anyone about what I was facing. Just a few months later, after the stress of my boyfriend moving away and school ending, I turned to cutting. The first time I cut I had the \u201cwow, I know why people do this\u201d moment. Now, almost a year after I made those first cuts I struggle everyday to stay clean and most of the time I fail. Everything makes me want to cut. Sometimes I can have a really good day and will still relapse that night. My body is covered in scars. Wrists, Shoulders, thighs, and hips with little white lines that reveal my pain. I wish I could go back to that girl a year ago and tell her not to do this to herself. I would show her all of my scars and tell her about all the times I was judged because of them and how people always treated me differently after they found out. Whenever I see the \u201cI just started cutting posts\u201d I think about how different my life would be now if I would have just stopped back then. So, I ask all of you who have recently started self-harming to really listen to my story and think about the effect it will have on your future. I know it will be hard but in the long run making the decision to stop now will be so helpful to you. \n\nWishing you all luck in your recovery journeys, wherever you may be. :)", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

But back then, we didnt know that it was BPD. Once in a while, she would cut herself. And no one would know about it, except me. \n\nIt was terrible every time she cuts herself. Therefore I made a package box and had it delivered to her. The package contained of some gauzes, antiseptic cream, antibiotic cream. I told her that I dont want her wound to become infected. I taught her to clean her wound, everytime she cuts. I would try my best to help her supressing her SH needs, avoiding triggers, as well as listened to her whenever she was triggered. And of course I encouraged her to get the proper help she needed from a trained psychiatrist.\n\nA while later, she did get herself into therapy, and properly diagnosed as BPD. It's good, she got better. However she was told, that I am the enabler for her SH. Somehow I was told that I were not helping her properly. That actually, I made her become worse. Unintentionally, of course. It laments me that the fact is, all I did was trying to help her. I'm the one who took her to see the psychiatrist, when no one else, not her family, not her fiancee, cares about her mental health.\n\nI never intended to become a bad influence, nor to lead her astray. I had my hands tied behind my back, in trying to help her, so I was doing everything I can. To help her get better, that was the purpose.\n\nWell, the good side is, she is better now. Although she kinda hates me and distanced herself away from me. And now that she's better; everyone around her, keep telling that I'm the bad guy, the bad influence. \n\nI accepted my fate. What began as a honest, sincere act, turns out to be a malevolent one. Not to mention that, I too, started SH. I finally understand why she needed to SH in the first place. It is a great way to channel the emotional pain, the one I cant bear it causes my chest to ache, sharply, knife-stakingly.\n\nI guess its true, we are all bad in someone's story.  I am, in hers. Well, at least, she got the help she needed. I got none. \n\n(This is my first post in Reddit, I apologize if it's not exactly in the right place/way)", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I don't feel like I have earned this tranquil feeling that I\u2019m experiencing right now and I know deep down that there\u2019s a layer of guilt and shame beneath it that will have to be addressed. \n\nI wonder who I\u2019ll tell. Last time, which was 51 days ago, I told one person that I had relapsed, and that was a month after it had happened. Before that I had been eight months clean. I wonder what people will think. Will they be angry? Disappointed? Ashamed of me? Am I projecting all of these emotions onto myself because that\u2019s how I truly feel about my relapse?\n\nYou know how people will joke about hurting you somewhere else when you\u2019re in some sort of pain, to make you forget about the original sensation? It\u2019s like that for me. On those late nights, when my anxiety is ruling me and I\u2019m in tears, when I have no support and it won\u2019t stop, that\u2019s exactly what it does for me. I don\u2019t feel anxious anymore. Self-harm feels good to me because I control the pain. I choose when it starts and stops, how much or little of it I feel and most importantly, I can\u2019t feel the other pain. My head will always be clear when I cut. \n\nI still know it\u2019s wrong. I know this is not a healthy way to cope. I have tried every self-help book, been to therapy, I have done congestive behavioral therapy, exercised, eaten healthy, if someone suggested it believe me, I\u2019ve tried it. Nothing ever feels the same as this. \n\nI\u2019m going to be honest, I don\u2019t have the solution either. When I first started, I was 16, I\u2019m 21 now. I don\u2019t have the kind of family support when it comes to this. When I first told them, I had been doing it a few years ago, they almost kicked me out of the house and accused me of doing it for attention. I was probably 18 around that time, so I haven\u2019t brought it up again. I have one close friend who I\u2019ve told, but to be honest I\u2019m terrified to tell him this time. I feel so alone and I\u2019m terrified about my anxiety inevitably coming back. I know the shameful calm can\u2019t last forever and I\u2019ll be unable to leave my house again soon. \n\nThe worst part?

No people over just a nice quiet apartment. \nMoving also causes me a lot of stress and anxiety due to some traumatic events that took place a while ago so I really needed a quiet calm environment. \nTurns out my friend isn't actually antisocial, she just doesn't like the people currently around her. And the ones she does like, she invites over and let's them sleep over; mainly her new bf which I didn't know about. \nIt's been causing me a lot of stress because intimacy is still taboo for me and I don't feel comfortable having people over yet. I need time to calm down and get used to the place, and she knows all about that. \nWe've talked about it and she assured me that things would change but nothing really has. \n\nI started cutting after the first few times and I think I'd get used to her having people over but I can't get used to her lying about them staying over or her \"accidentally\" locking me out of the house for a while. \nThe worst part about everything is that I've been trying to calm down with my issues and keep them internal so that I don't get in the way because I know it's not normal for me to feel this way (it causes me to be a bit numb and cold with people cuz I don't want to snap or lash out or something) and she tells me that she doesn't like seeing me that way and that if I keep it up it'll cause her to become depressed too. \n\nShe expects me to deal with my issues so that I don't inconvenience her but she won't do the same for me. I regret moving in with her and wish I'd just roomed with random people from Craigslist because that way I'd at least not care about the other people. \n\nMy self harm is getting worse and it really scared me. My mental state is getting worse, and this was supposed to help me since I'd get more sleep. \n\nIt's just a lot of emotional crap and I know it's illogical and whatnot but it's hard for me to deal with my emotions right now and it really sucks. \n\nI'm sorry to anyone that reads this, I just needed a place to rant and I hope you have an amazing day!\n\nUpdate:\n\nTalked to my mom about it and she's really mad at her... My mom thought she was super sweet and nice. \nSo she thought of a plan to get back at her. \nBasically I'm gonna remove myself from the lease and move to a one bedroom apartment. Won't give my roommate a notice untill the day of me moving out. So basically she'll be fucked. \nShe'll probably get emails about it but idk if she will notice them. \nI know it's really messed up and I'm still having an internal argument about it but I believe in treating others the way you want to be treated, and I just see it as a way of returning the treatment. \nYesterday we talked and she made up this shit about it being the social networking age and she can't help it and that I have to get used to it... I don't have a problem with socializing with people when I have to and have enough good connections to not have to worry about things; I just don't like having people over that I don't know or trust without any notice or her lying to me about whether they stay over and having them sneak out before I wake up. \n\nI went to see my mom yesterday and we had a nice day, she drove me back home and wanted to use the bathroom... She had at least two guys sleeping in her room, they were \"friends\" from work and I'm sure her bf wasn't in there either. So now my mom thinks she's been sleeping with a bunch of guys and that made her even madder. \n\nShe also helped me realize that all she's been doing is manipulating me to get what she wants with complete disregard of my well-being.\nSo now I'm just returning the favor.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

So... I haven\u2019t told anyone about my sh. I made the mistake of showing my friend my leg where there were three huge cuts (barely even styro) and told her I fell. She got suspicious, and later on showed my teacher whom I\u2019m very close to. My teacher didn\u2019t believe me that I fell. She thinks I cut myself. Then, about a week or so ago, I cut my fingers (idk why exactly I just did) and my friend who I showed my cuts on my leg to thought it was suspicious that there were so many on my fingers and that it couldn\u2019t just be thorns and my cat. My teacher also noticed. Fuck me. She won\u2019t stop asking about them cause she KNOWS I do, but I just can\u2019t bring myself to tell her. I don\u2019t want my mom knowing. I don\u2019t even think I want help. I just want to fuck it all. And help myself if needed. So then today, my friend and she was like \u201chow do I get a blade to slit my wrists\u201d (joking) and I was like \u201cget a little pencil sharpener, break it open and use that blade\u201d and she was like how tf do u know that. I just said I know things and she was like show me your wrists and so I did (because I don\u2019t cut on my wrists) and then she was like lemme see your ankles. My fucking blood drained from my face instantly. I didn\u2019t wear long socks that day and those were the cuts I didn\u2019t even show her. I showed her ones on my calf. And she fucking lifted my jeans up and saw them and then yelled \u201cI knew it! I knew you were depressed!!\u201d but I pretend to fall on the floor and so she couldn\u2019t see them anymore. I joked about it and was like yep I\u2019m depressed yep I cut with a straight face meaning I\u2019m being sarcastic even tho I\u2019m not and then dropped the conversation. She didn\u2019t ask me about it again. \n\nAlso!!! The only person I had EVER told about my sh irl is my bf (or ex idek).He calls it \u201cdoing stupid shit\u201d. Which I agree with but it\u2019s my way of coping. We were dating for two and a quarter months and then he ghosted me after a fight we had (don\u2019t wanna talk about it). He never answered my texts or called me for 17 days. Until today. He called me in class, thankfully with my fav teacher who I\u2019m rlly close to and who is convinced I cut, and I showed my friend and told my teacher I had to answer it. So I did without her officially saying yes and everyone watched me. It was so awkward but I couldn\u2019t move to get up. I was having an anxiety attack on the phone with him. He just said hey how\u2019re you doing, stuff like that, and then he was like how is it with ur mom and dad and yeah. Then he said are you done doing stupid shit? (Cutting) and I couldn\u2019t say no... so I said yes kinda and he said okay. And then he said I\u2019ll let you go, I just wanted to see how you were doing. And I was like okay and then he said goodbye and hung up. Wtf. I don\u2019t even know where to fucking start. This fucking bastard made me cry every fucking day for NINE DAYS!

I often don't do this if I don't feel like it, and might wear the same clothes for a week. If you feel like self-harming, try a really hot or cold shower, that sometimes helps me.\n\n\n3. Do something nice for someone else. Even something small like holding the door for the person behind you or saying thank you to the bus driver.\n\n\n4. Watch, read, or listen to something funny. \n\n\n5. Do something you want to do.

My arm was numb and at the beginning the cuts were just on surface there were not to much blood. And the darkest time of my life has begun. I ordered some razor blades from internet because in my country it is not easy to find them in shops. I learned how to cut deeper. I started doing it now I have a lot of scars on my arm. I thought about suicide a lot. I was saying to myself \"nobody gives a goddamn thing about you, just cut a bit deeper, nobody will be upset when you gone\" So yes. I tried to suicide with antidepressants but mom caught me so I failed. I am gonna do it sooner or later.

Big and dark bruises, marks that stays for weeks all over my body.

It would bother me (and does bother me) to think of anyone else harming themselves. But it is different for me somehow - like the things I believe about others don\u2019t apply to me. In my mind, it is not damaging when I do it to myself. It generally has a positive association to me personally - it was there for me when no one else was. It was my safe place when I needed one desperately. It was my coping mechanism in so many different situations and for so many reasons. It became my solution to any problem, and when things get rough, it still comforts me to think of turning to that. \n\nBut my life is headed in such a different direction now. I am doing so many good things for myself. I am beginning to love myself and believe in myself. There are people who love me who would be destroyed to know I hurt myself, and though I wish my current motivation was myself and my newfound sense of self-worth, I\u2019m just not there yet. I\u2019m still in a place where cutting often feels comforting and soothing when I am overwhelmed. I mostly no longer need it as punishment because I do feel much differently about myself, but I still crave it as a physical release. I know it \u201cworks\u201d for the things I struggle with, so it doesn\u2019t feel like a bad thing when I think of turning to that. The reason I am here is because I don\u2019t want to hurt the people who love me anymore. I have hurt them in the past with this, and I no longer want to be selfish like that.

Help.", "author": "ENTP4", "self_text": "Hello! I just created this throw away account because I wanted advice from people who may understand the situation of my partner a little better than I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will quickly break down the situation: So, I live out of province for university and for summer break I was going to visit my home town for 2 weeks before heading off to a fishing lodge. Upon arrival in my home town, I began to reconnect with all of my childhood friends (from 4 years ago before school) and realized that a big part of my heart was being neglected. One of these first 2 week nights I went to a Beer Fest event with a group of 10 friends who had secretly 'set up' me and this guy (both of us a part of the same friend group, but never had met). They did not have to do much because as soon as we saw each other, we felt something neither of us had expected. After that moment, I knew I had found the person I wanted to be with.\n\n\\*\\*background on why I say that: I am a 24 year old female who has only been in 1 long term relationship of 4 years, besides that I have only casually dated where my partners feelings were strong but mine weren't. I guess I am considered attractive, and I have been courted many times, but I never seemed to find much interest in men. I have broken up with everyone I have been with because I know my morals and what I want, and I don't want to compromise as I am very happy with myself and don't struggle from loneliness\\*\\*\n\nSo, anyways. After that moment, it made perfect sense to me why people fall in love and want to listen to love songs. He is everything I am not, but in the perfect way. He is soft-spoken, emotionally in-tuned, generous, furiously honest, comforting, caring, etc.; I, on the other hand, am extremely driven, operate through logic/rationale, outgoing, fun-hearted, and desire to turn any mundane situation into a fun time, I am also fiercely loyal to those who deserve it - this becomes relevant later. The result was an instant connection which made perfect sense (we have the same group of friends who we have had since we were 10, he is introverted so he didn't go to the events where everyone gathered but rather hung out more one-on-one with people).\n\nNOW, TO MY AREA OF CONCERN.\n\nThis man has been cheated on, lied to, manipulated in severely brutal ways over the course of his entire life by female partners, yet he loves to love. He trusts way too easily and allows his girlfriends to treat him poorly. He has been cheated on three times and has been broken hearted more than I can even imagine. He is very honest about everything when I ask. Most recently, he was living with a girl who cheated on him, stole over 5,000 dollars, and had a full blown relationship behind his back when he was in the same room via text. He moved out before Christmas (alarmingly recent, but I fully trust and believe that he has no feelings for her. He hates dishonesty and he feels disgusted with the idea of even hearing her voice). The issue is that when he began to open up about his previous relationships, I saw a pattern of him falling for girls who are depressed and engaged in self-harm. He has multiple girls tell him that if he breaks up with them, they will commit suicide or engage in self-harm via cutting. The case is not isolated to one or two, but rather is a pattern I have heard. Later on, he opened up further to reveal two previous attempts at ending his own life. That is when I really began to notice the scarring on his arm. They are quite bad, but have healed up and are white in shade now. as in They looked really, really big and deep. I would never in a hundred years have guessed he would have ever done that. He is so caring, big hearted, and outwardly concerned that it is such a foreign idea for me. That being said, I have slowly began to piece the puzzle together. I see how quickly he was willing to give me his heart which is exactly the reason I wanted to take it, and believe me when I say I never want to lose it. I have found the one I have always wanted and I have no intentions on letting it go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said, I have a slight notion that he self-harms when these relationships aren't working out. I think he places a great deal of happiness on a relationship and I am more than willing to give it to him. But what I don't know is how to connect all of the dots: is being with him after he recently got out of a serious relationship a bad thing? Am I going to cause serious harm to him? And how should I address - if at all - his history with cutting?\n\nI can't seem to shake all of this from my mind and I really do not want to damage this relationship based on his past.\n\nI am super unfamiliar with cutting/self-harm, and I really do care about this guy.

They threatened divorce several times. Had I been much older at the time, I would\u2019ve seen this behavior and believed they were fine and would patch things up like they always did. However, I was naive, so every time their marriage was \u201changing in the balance\u201d it tore me apart for WEEKS. That\u2019s how long they fought for; weeks. They would have a blow out and scream at each other the whole night whilst my brother and I hid in our rooms. Then they\u2019d be silent for 3-5 weeks afterward. Playing mind games with each other and using my brother and I as messengers to \u201cconverse.\u201d My dad hated my brother for reasons I won\u2019t say, actually physically abused him early on. So when arguments were started, they were about my brother or money. Since he was so hated, he was safe from being IN the argument. However, I have a similar mindset as my dad, (he and I are more logical and base our behaviors on facts/my brother and mom are very emotional and feeling based.) So, at the ripe old age of 8-9, I was a mediator for my parents marriage. I clearly remember telling my mom when I was roughly 10, \u201cbe the bigger person and say you\u2019re sorry, instead of wasting your time together.\u201d \n\n\nThat\u2019s the short story, I may go into detail in the comments or something.\n\nWhen I was 11, I grabbed a paring knife and went to my room. I\u2019d heard of kids at my school doing this kind of stuff, but I didn\u2019t really think much of it until that night. I didn\u2019t do anything, I was too scared. I wrapped the sharp end with a Kleenex and shoved it in between my bed frame and the mattress; I\u2019d put it back at a later time. A few months later, my mom picked me up from Show Choir practice, and as she turned the vehicle off in our garage, she confronted me about it. My brother had gone through my stuff (that BASTARD) and found it. I came clean, told her that the constant fighting and bringing me into it was wearing me out. The convo ended sometime later and we\u2019ve never spoke of it since. I\u2019m not even sure if she brought the topic up to my father.\n\nWhen I was 13, I was a teenage girl going through puberty. I had body issues, family issues, trust problems with friends, didn\u2019t feel like I fit in anywhere. I was a clich\u00e9. So one night, I was having a breakdown in my room. My brother had an old pocketknife on my dresser and I grabbed it and made one cut on my left wrist. That hurt like a bitch. I immediately hated it, why would someone do that to themselves? I scrambled to dab away what little blood there was (\u2018\u2018tis was only a scratch) and bandaged it. I spent the next several minutes anxiously figuring out how I\u2019d hide the wound until it healed. I ended up wearing those [Silly Bandz](https://www.amazon.com/Silly-Bandz-Fun-Shapes-Pack/dp/B002NBN7CC) and thick rubber bracelets that were so popular back then. It was gone within a week.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until awhile later than I realized that hurting myself had worked. The anticipation of the blood, the pain. The actual act of hurting yourself. The clean up, and hiding it. It all distracted me from what I was originally anxious about.\n\nWELCOME TO THE BEGINNING\n\nSometime after that, I began harming myself regularly (at that time it was a few times a month) and I took care of all my scars. I hurt my thighs and hips, since I believed my wrists were too obvious of an area. I was so shallow with my cuts and so careful about everything, my scars faded pretty easily. Until...\n\nWhen I was roughly 14, I cut myself deeper than I ever had. Which, when I look back on it, wasn\u2019t that bad. But I\u2019d \u201clost my control\u201d and went deeper than I was used to. I thought I was going to bleed out. Or that someone was going to walk in on me and call the ambulance (I hate hospitals.) I woke up before my alarm the next morning, having cried myself to sleep, I had blood on my sheets and my legs. (You know how a minimal amount of blood looks like a crime scene when smeared.)  I swore to myself that I\u2019d never cut again.\n\nHahaha!\n\nI relapsed once or twice after that, but I was clean for about 1.5-2 years before I relapsed again. This time because I had recently gotten my first bf (I was 16) and we had a minor disagreement which made me believe I\u2019d fucked everything up. That lead to binges that happened once a week for three weeks. I marred my basically perfect skin, using the entire front of my right thigh as a canvas. Gone were the days of shorts and swimming.\n\nI screwed up several times after that, but again managed to stay \u201cclean\u201d for about a year. But when I turned 18, I broke up with my 17yo bf because of my abandonment issues. He was the only one I trusted with my heart, we dated for 2 years, and he knew about my self harm and even coaxed me out of it a few times. Not having him there was devastating.\n\nWELCOME TO THE BEGINNING OF THE END\n\nI didn\u2019t have my bf. I\u2019d been lying to my parents about my health for a decade, I was beginning to hate my job. And said job put me on swing shifts. I worked 7-3pm some days, and 11-7am on others.\n\nIt\u2019s always worse at night.\n\nIdk if it\u2019s the loneliness, the fact that I\u2019m tired after a long day, the darkness, etc. but working that night shift was detrimental. I no longer had any qualms about my safety. I would sit in the staff bathroom and cut myself nearly every time I worked nights. Blood would drip to the floor and seep through my black pants. I no longer feared the blade. When you are inexperienced, you\u2019re scared of what it can do, how it can hurt you. But as you use it, you become numb to it. The blade is an extension of your hand, and you control it. Cutting became something I did out of pure boredom. Gone were the days that I hurt myself only because I was about to break down. Had it been too long? Cut. Had you eaten to much for dinner? Cut. Didn\u2019t you forget to pay that bill? Cut. Oh yeah, you also broke the heart of the only man who has truly loved you, and you still love him. Fucking cut,\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m a bit better now, I quit that job, and I also got back together with my BF (4 years now). However, I still struggle a lot. I find myself, at random, wanting to lock myself in a bathroom and mark my thigh. But I know the BF will find out, and I hate his disapproval. \n\nWhat I wouldn\u2019t give for that release. I miss the blood, the scabs and the scars. It\u2019s demented, but it\u2019s reality. It\u2019s been damn near a year since I\u2019ve cut myself and I\u2019m feening at an opportunity to sabotage that victory.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Immediately all my classmates care about her, tell her they'll be there for her, ... Reacting when they hear a mere pension of the 'depression' or 'mental health'. And I am meanwhile still getting ignored, even though it is obvious that I selfharm and even though I oftentimes walk around with a thousand yard stare on my face. \n\nI feel terrible for that girl that her depression got worse and I am happy for her that she is getting help and that my classmates at least care for her. But I just feel so ignored and lonely right now.\n\nNone of them cares about me. Or they all seem to go 'he is a guy, he'll deal with it, he can take it'.\n\nIt's not because I don't cry that I am alright. I just have been feeling so bad for so long that I can't cry anymore.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

She even refused to help me go to a therapist because every therapist in Germany (don't know how it is in other countries) needs a meeting with the parents (I'm a minor) twice a month and she couldn't risk her job. \n\nSo to sum it up: My mom won't help me get therapy, gets mad at me for having unhealthy coping mechanisms, tells me to commit suicide and would rather lose her child than her job.\n\nShe hasn't apologized to this day and still calls herself a \"great mom\"\n\nEdit: I can go to therapy but it won't really work because my mom is the main cause of my problems and she would need to change her behavior\n\nEdit2: I will definetly go search for a therapist myself and just tell my family that I will be out with a friend. Maybe I will even move to a good friend's house for a few weeks.\n\nFunfact: My mom was bullied for 4 months and got slight depression because of it. She talked about it all the time, went to therapy every second day and even took meds. I was bullied for 3 years and never got support. Not from the teachers nor from my mom. I was kicked so hard that I had a visible footprint on my back for over a week. The only thing my mom did was yell at the principal.

{"post_id": "bsaxpg", "created_utc": 1558661118, "title": "My self harm story", "author": "dumbperson26", "self_text": "I started cutting back in January 2019. Everything felt like it was going down hill, I would cut almost every night on my forearm. Let me tell you they were very noticeable if I wasn't wearing long sleeves.One day I took off my sweatshirt to do some handstands with my \"friends\" (you'll get why I put that in quotes later). The night before I had cut so there were a lot of fresh cuts on my arm. I knew that some of the girls saw them but said nothing, you have no idea how relived I was when they said nothing about the cuts. By the end of March things started to get better and I was clean for most of April. Then May rolled around. I started cutting my right hip, they were not deep cuts so they healed pretty fast. One day during lunch the girl I supposed to be my best friend (who we'll call Ashley ) completely turned against me. She told everyone that I had pictures of my crush (who we'll call James) on my phone. Of course James didn't belive Ashley so he shrugged it off while my anxiety was slapping me in the face. During class I pulled out my siccors and tried to cut my calves to try and relive the stress, thank god no one noticed. On the bus I was sitting by my other friend Britney and I was telling the guy across from us what happened at lunch. He said maybe she just has feelings for James, all of a sudden Britney jumps in and says \" Ashley doesn't like boys, she asked (My name) out just last weekend\" (which was true). Ashley starts crying and of course. When I get off the bus I get a text from James on snapchat saying \" Ashley showed me the chats, don't ever call me bae again\" then he blocked me. Long story short I absolutely hated Ashley, James hated me, Britney went on Ashley's side and so did all of my other \"friends\", and now I'm the out cast. Every night since then I would cut my thighs, hips, and forearms. Everyone was so mean to me for no reason. Not to long ago Ashley wrote me a letter saying that she wanted to be my friend again and all I had to do was apologize. WHEN I DID NOTHING AND IT WAS ALL BRITNEY WHO SPILLED HER SECRET. I took one good look at my arms, hips, and thighs then I wrote back making it clear that she caused all of this, and that I will never even give her a second thought. If I cut because of someone I will never be nice to them and I will not even think twice about denying their friendship request. Since then Britney relized how rude Ashley is and came running back to me, she is the only one who knew about when I would self harm back in January but she has no idea what she has done..I don't think I can fully trust her again...\nEdit: School is starting to get so much worse, a few people have started making fun of a stuttering problem I have, even my brothers are. Things are going ok between Britney and I even though I can sense that she is only trying to gain my trust so she can stab me in the back again. For some strange reason Ashley keeps staring at me in class and every where I go. Last night I burned a Polaroid of Ashley, I stood right by the fire with the biggest smile on my face. It honestly felt great knowing that I had finally fully let go of her. I had the worst urges to cut today and for once I was able to fight them. I hope that I'm at least able to stay clean for all of summer.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

First put pressure on for a few minutes, then clean the area/check for debris and apply dressings.Dressings/plasters/bandaids/whatever should be changed at MINIMUM once after the first 24 hours, but really they should be changed every day or every two days.\n\nAfter day 4 or 5, leave dressings off so that the area can get air and finish healing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf the yeet does not stop releasing yeet-juice within 15 minutes, and/or is pumping/spurting yeet-juice out periodically, **SEEK IMMEDIATE URGENT MEDICAL ATTENTION, YOU'VE HIT A MAJOR YEET-JUICE PIPE.**\n\nIf the yeet is deep and near/on a joint, and/or you can see fat (weird bubbly stuff, different to styro), **SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION. If you have hit fat DO NOT SUPERGLUE IT. Normal glues are very different to hospital glues, and whilst going to A&amp;E is scary, superglue in yeets is** ***incredibly*** **dangerous.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor burns/hot yeets:  First cool the area by either running under cool (not *cold*; don't want to cool it too quickly) or applying a cool wet flannel or similar for minimum 5 minutes, generally 10-15 minutes. DO NOT break blisters, as they are there to protect you against infection. If a blister breaks by itself, clean the area with water. Don't use ice or cotton, these increase damage hugely.\n\nAfter the area is cooled, apply lotion such as aloe vera or a moisturizer. Then antibiotic cream if you have it.\n\nDON'T hugely cover or immediately cover the area. This is apparently the #1 mistake people make: immediately or heavily covering the area causes heat left over from the hot yeet to be trapped in the skin, increasing damage, causing severe pain (particularly damage and pain to areas deep underneath the skin) and increasing healing time.\n\nInstead, wait a few hours and continue to apply lotion. Then cover with a LOOSE gauze (that doesn't put pressure on the area), which should be taken off for an hour each day and should be replaced frequently. When it's taken off, apply more moisturizer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf the hot yeet causes the skin to look leathery and/or white and/or waxy, is deep, has charring or is near a joint, then **regardless** of the pain levels **SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION, THIS IS A 3RD DEGREE HOT YEET.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd of course if you're ever worried about a yeet, regardless of whether it meets points I've put above, seek medical attention. Better to be cautious and check than get something infected.\n\nTake care of yourselves, people. I know you're probably gonna yeet, but yeet safely.", "subreddit": "MadeOfStyrofoam"}

The things Im thinking of are all bad. I want to try smoking (which ive never done before) or cut again or something else. I just feel wretched and i dont know what the fuck to do. I just try to find some kind of tasty food, it runs out, i try to do some other thing, it get old. I need a release. I need some advice. But im too tired to chat really, and i dont know if that would help anyways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFuck... I need a release. This hurts... I feel horrible... I want to cut even though i know its not fucking good. or just something. Some pleasure. Some release. Anyone know any really addicting video games or something?", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

{"post_id": "bt44q8", "created_utc": 1558846793, "title": "6 Years No Cuts [22M]", "author": "VerzChain", "self_text": "Hello All,\n\nThe first thing that has helped me is cutting hair, specifically my own hair. I like cutting my hair off, I've even shaved down to bald before. I also manage other areas of my body with a razor and this is somewhat peaceful. Cutting with a purpose you could say, I don't use a straight razor, that could be too much temptation.\n\nWhen I'm up North, another thing I do is chop wood. It's a very fun and active way to deal and cope with whatever you're going through. Although, please do be careful to not hit yourself, it's possible if you miss entirely. Just take it slow and after awhile you get used to it.\n\nI write sometimes about my feelings, albeit this proves to be less of a help and kind of makes me angry at myself. I have a very bad habit of reflecting on everything I wish I did differently so I try my best not to write about me but to write short stories. \n\nRoller coasters are fucking fantastic. If you want to flirt with death and get a great release of stress these are perfect. \n\nMusic is a beautiful thing, I do subscribe to the theory though that the content of the music you listen to will have an affect on your mood. So try to keep at least some of the songs Happy, my favorite songs are depressing but I have to balance that out with a couple of happy songs that I like.\n\nMovies are great too, watching others deal with possible real life situations that may be like your own or harder can sometimes put things into perspective.\n\nHaving a job is helpful sometimes. This kind of goes along with keeping yourself busy, having something to do during the day is a good way to keep your mind off things. Also making money and being able to buy stuff feels good.\n\nOne last thing is something that I wish I kind of knew before getting into a relationship. You can't get a happy GF/BF/AnyF and expect it to change your mood. It does help sometimes to be in a supporting relationship, but they never will truly know what you're going through. Most of the time if I tried talking about said issues it would kind of send her to an awkward dark place. Don't feel bad about being alone is the point I'm really trying to get to. Just because you can have someone in your life doesn't mean that their happiness will rub off on to you. \n\nOh and don't forget to Live! Make some friends or try to, drink some and maybe even smoke some weed if it's legal in your state. Improve your mind and body, read some books or listen to them, maybe even watch some podcasts. I can't guarantee that any of these things will make you feel better. We all have dark days, some more than others. The important thing is that we try to not drown ourselves in misery and despair, but try to keep our heads above the repetitive crashing waves.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

This year especially has been pretty bad and now I have three very bright redish pink raised scars I dont understand why, all the cuts that drew blood before have never left scars like this before.

Me and (let's call her Liz) started dating after she moved in, so we like a skipped the whole dating/honeymoon phase and immediately jumped to the comfortable living stage.\n\nLiz has a history of self-harming. In the past month she has been flat out with work (working 40+ hours) and we've been finding it difficult to give each other the space that we both need, as well as struggling with her personal matters. \nWe had a minor falling out last week - because of all the stress in her life right now she has been irritable and actually quite condescending towards me, undermining everything I say and generally being a bit of an asshole (We give eachother healthy amounts of abuse normally but myself and the boys have noticed it's actually becoming quite mean). \nSo I decided to discuss it with her and stand my ground, not taking it personally but saying it in the sense of 'here I don't like to be talked to in that way', which I think is fair. I understand how the stresses of life become overwhelming sometimes and I also understand poor mental health from my own experiences, but I always try to figure things out myself and not lash out at others for my own problems. Anyway, Liz got quite upset at this and felt very guilty, but I assured her that it was sorted- we discussed it, no grudges held, it's in the past. \n\nA few days passed and I noticed fresh cuts (maybe a day old) on her thigh while we were getting ready to go to bed. \nI don't know how to bring this up with her, if at all.

I told my bf I cut about a month ago, and while I have talked about it, it's been very light talk(no details, rarely actually telling him, making jokes, etc). I know it hurts him and he didn't sign up for it, which is why I keep it a minimum and only mention it explicitly to him when I really really need to\n\nWell... One of those times came a couple days ago. It was a rough day, and I ended up taking some over the counter painkillers and cutting on my upper arm. \n\nWell, after it happened, I texted him because I was just in a dark place. I admitted what I did, and we had a short honest talk about it.\n\nHe said he feels guilty and sad whenever I mention it, and feels sad knowing that I cut. He says he feels guilty that he isn't able to help, as if he isn't good enough because he can't make my stop. Even if he stops me 99/100 of the times, that one time just kills him. \n\nWithout going into details, he admitted that this is how he felt when a close family member died. He wasn't sad they were gone, but sad over what he missed/what he could have done better.\n\nI just... I don't know what to do. I don't want him to feel this way, it makes me feel terrible on so many levels. But... I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should just stop mentioning it, if I should help him understand it better, or what.\n\nI don't want this to divide us, and I've been toying with the idea of taking up my mom's offer to see a counselor. I don't know how much I'd be open up, but a part of me wants to simply so that my bf could be happier. \n\nI just want some of y'alls advice before I talk to him about it. \n\nTldr: Bf feels sad/guilty knowing I cut/whenever I mention it because he wants to be able to help more.

I started to use razors to cut , I loved it seeing the blood come out wow was so much of a rush and release of pain.

As in, she laughs at me, makes fun of me for it, and always wants to see it. My dad just looks very upset. I haven\u2019t cut in three to four days. I\u2019m actually proud of myself. I hope I can make it to a week. I\u2019ve been wanting to post on r/selfharmscars but I need to see how long I can stay clean.\n\nBut last week was the worst week I\u2019ve had in the last two months. I\u2019ve apparently contemplated suicide heavily, recently. It is the equivalent to what I said in my other post on here. \n\nMoving on, because I don\u2019t want to get into that, I asked my friend if he had a box cutter. I was very certain he had one because he\u2019s the type to have blades just for fun or hunting. He said he did but he asked why. Now, I told this friend that I cut.  (In April I told him, I believe) And he said that he used to do the same, so he knows where I\u2019m coming from. He showed me his and they were a few but deep. But, when I showed him mine, he was very shocked and upset. He said he doesn\u2019t want me doing it, and I completely understand. But, I couldn\u2019t stop then. So, he made me promise not to cut and that he\u2019ll check my arms. I made the promise. But last weekend, I broke the promise. I cut my right upper arm a bit. And I confessed to him, saying that I broke the promise and that I\u2019m really sorry. He was upset at me and he doesn\u2019t trust me with the box cutter. He\u2019s only letting me keep it for now to see if I\u2019ll do it again. My boyfriend doesn\u2019t approve of him giving me the box cutter so I had to promise to him too. I also confessed to my boyfriend that I failed to keep that promise. He was also upset but he is actively trying to help me. \n\nI hope to update soon.

I purposefully scratched my thigh so hard it bled and felt so much better yet 100 times worse.\n\nI suffer from severe depression and GAD. I\u2019ve always been super anxious and started becoming depressed once I was in fourth grade. I\u2019ve gotten diagnosed, go to therapy, and take meds for my anxiety and insomnia. TL;DR I\u2019m an emotional wreck, I\u2019ve just gotten better at hiding it and convincing people I\u2019m getting better.\n\nI love my family with all of my heart. My mental health is not due to any trauma caused by them or someone else, and I suppose I\u2019ve had it pretty good. This has caused me to hate myself for having these thoughts in the first place because I have so much. My family are the only reason why I\u2019m alive today.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean I still don\u2019t wish I was dead. It\u2019s so hard to look in the mirror and pin point everything I hate about myself. I feel like a burden though no one has said something to completely convince me of that. Again, the only reason I haven\u2019t killed myself is because I know they\u2019d be heartbroken.\n\nThis has turned the suicidal thoughts into self harming ones. I don\u2019t want to die necessarily, I just feel as though I deserve pain. I\u2019ll hit myself, scratch myself, burn myself, and have considered cutting almost every day for the past week.\n\nI know self harm is a slippery slope I don\u2019t want to go on. But it feels like my options are killing myself or hurting myself. Everything seems like such a daze and I feel like I\u2019ll just break down at any moment. I really don\u2019t want to tell my family because I know how much they love me and I know it\u2019d hurt them if they found out how much I hate myself.\n\nI know I just seem like a typical edgy teenager but I feel so lost and hopeless right now.

This\u2019ll be very ramble-y. So I was actually fine for a long while but I don\u2019t know how long. Either two months or maybe six? I have periods of time where I\u2019m utterly unstable in every aspect of my life, and other times where I\u2019m able to bury that easily with a minor amount of self harm, dissociation, and a sprinkle of disordered eating. It\u2019s easy for me to just ignore the Bad Thoughts when I\u2019m in the latter times, when I\u2019m not debilitating unstable ya know?\n\nSo I was ok until a couple days ago... I think? Been dissociating a lot and it feels like my grasp on reality is real low right now lmao. Nothing really happened I just literally didn\u2019t do any of the homework I *have* to do and I got stressed out. It isn\u2019t a minor assignment that won\u2019t affect my marks at all, this time it\u2019ll pretty much destroy my fragile self-worth haha (kill me!). I decided I would rather spend the valuable time I could\u2019ve spent on the project laying in bed dissociating and reading shit on the internet and only leaving to obsessively do body checks. Or maybe to purge or cut. Or maybe to lay on the floor because sometimes I just want to lay on the floor, so at least I\u2019m not laying in bed all day. Really anything that involves my self-destructive and/or impulsive behaviours in some way.\n\nI just feel so empty inside? I haven\u2019t dealt with mood swings almost at all since my last mental breakdown, not enough to ruin my life like before. But my constant feelings of being dead-inside are all-consuming now. It feels like I\u2019ve hollowed out every emotional side of me to the point where I\u2019m hardly a person anymore. In my efforts to get rid of my extreme emotions I got rid of my regular ones as well! I became too good at self-destructive coping mechanisms apparently... It was easy to ignore when I felt like I had friends. The emptiness I mean. Now I\u2019m isolating myself again see? I feel like I\u2019m only letting myself stay anorexic and a habitual self-harmer because it keeps these feelings at bay (but it doesn\u2019t anymore anyway???). I don\u2019t even know what to call it...\n\nI really want to go to a hospital sometimes, in my more rational moments. It feels like I have very little self control and I want to stop destroying my life but I can\u2019t rely on myself to do it. I think I\u2019d have to be forced. But alas, I have school. I\u2019ll just hope to stay alive till I have time to get committed.\n\nIn a nutshell it\u2019s been a rough week because of reasons I caused! I wish I\u2019d stop. Thanks for reading my rant.\n\nIt feels like my coping mechanisms have created more problems than they\u2019ve solved. It feels like I can hardly function now lol.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I guess you could say I like trapping myself in other worlds so that I can escape real life and my emptiness.

This post became a bit long (too long) but feel free to give any kind of advice if you think I need it (what to do re: my friend, but also who else I might reach out to, anything about self harm, a more appropriate subreddit to post this)\n\nI wrote up my story of cutting and kept it below but it\u2019s not crucial to my main question. I have a good friend A who has disclosed a lot of her former/current mental health shit to me including selfharm. She was also a huge rock for me last year when I struggled a lot with depression/wanting to quit my work. I started self harming last August (after my tough year, and after she had told about her self harm past a bit). I can\u2019t remember if I had brought it up to her at all (I think I eventually did) but we haven\u2019t talked about it much if I did. I also told 1 other friend and my therapist (and have generally kept my therapist 100% up to date, also I have a therapist thanks to A suggesting it) up to date.\n\nNow things might be getting worse and part of me wants to reach out to A \u2014 since she can understand, support, and provably advise me in ways my therapist might not be able to \u2014 but I don\u2019t know if that would help either of us. I have heard stories about people who break their clean streak specifically after trying to help out friends in similar situations, and don\u2019t know if that\u2019s fair to her. I know she hasn\u2019t done it in years but other issues have been popping up for her and idk. I also worry that I\u2019m \u201cpicking up\u201d her habits/coping mechanisms and issues as ways to deal w my own (is that a thing?) so maybe talking to her isn\u2019t the best for me either? I feel like I\u2019ve subconsciously avoided her this year, mostly because I feel like I shouldn\u2019t talk to her about these things (but would want to) and she\u2019s having a hard time in general, and if I hang out with her I\u2019ll just dump my own issues on to the plate (mental health and just general life is stressful shit).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThe story of my self harm and why I feel like reaching out now \n\n I self harmed for the first time last year in August and have probably only done it 6-7 times since, as a way to try to cope with feeling really depressed, panicky, angry at myself, apathetic etc. I haven\u2019t been too worried about it since I only think of it when I feel crappy and it\u2019s honestly felt like it\u2019s been an OK coping strategy \u2014 I would think back to the year before I had cut myself and I had many panic attack like moments that might have been shorter or addressed better had I had this coping strategy. I also generally have not been increasing the intensity of the cutting sessions: the number, location, depth (v shallow) of the cuts has generally been constant \n\nBut also I\u2019ve felt that part of what has kept it in check is simply that I\u2019ve been feeling better overall. The reason I haven\u2019t cut deeper/more might be because even though each cut does less each time, I also haven\u2019t been feeling that bad, so it doesn\u2019t take much to feel OK. These past few days have been the most stressful I\u2019ve had in a while and I had a pretty bad panic attack and dealt with it by cutting \u2014 and cut a lot more and in more places than I had before (still very shallow and I think safe health wise). And after I felt better I had a weird sense I wanted to keep going and cover more of my body. I didn\u2019t because right now it\u2019s still not possible for me to bring myself to cut unless I\u2019m feeling especially shitty/in a dark place, but the appeal of cutting for the sake of cutting and the extent to which I had cut are both new and I\u2019m worried they signal a slippery slope from cutting as a coping mechanism to something both more addictive/physically dangerous", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I am very introverted and stuck in my head a lot. I have C-PTSD just to kinda help understand what is going on in my head right now. I've had it since age 13 and I follow the C-PTSD subreddit as well. I have a really stressful job and have had a lot of terrible things happen in my life. Granted I took up smoking to knock off the cutting, still trying to quit that replacement habit as well. I cope with writing in my journal, artwork, reading (Currently finishing up the trilogy of \"The child called it\") I knit to keep my hands busy, writing poetry, carving objects, so on so forth. I've been self harming since age 11 I am currently 22. (Sorry if I'm getting too over-personal, but its just me being out of my mind and venting.) I work a very stressful job and I feel myself tip toeing between what feels like psychopathic and sociopathic thought systems. I feel like if I do not stay in the middle of those thin lines of corrupt thinking I am pushed over the edge into a sea of guilt, desperation, insanity, darkness, isolation, fear of society, judgement, etc. I am currently seeing a therapist and I am about to try to get back on my correct medications. I feel like I am in survival mode again and I feel so disconnected from reality. I am going through burn out at my job and my relationship is becoming strained because I am unconsciously not taking care of myself. When I do not relieve myself through this coping skill I developed that is frowned upon, I do not eat, I force myself to throw up, I day dream about it, I toss and turn at night, I stay up 72 hours at a time, I overwork, I neglect all of my positive coping skills. I am just at my wits end. I normally do not post anything. I hate to speak up or out about my problems publicly. I prefer to be a private person. I prefer to be proud in the background for peoples success. I prefer to cry in the background when I feel empathy towards someone, but I cannot bring myself to offer what I have to say, because it just feels like I will say something wrong. I like to think about myself as a background character in even my own life. I just pretend to watch my life like a movie and I'm always on the edge of my seat. I apologize if I will trigger anyone with my venting. I know what it feels like to struggle. I know what it feels like to feel defeated because you relapsed. I know what it feels like to be on top of the world because you have gone SO long without doing it. I understand that my body is precious and for right now its the only one I got. I realize as well that my mind is different from others so I am more prone to this behavior, that is not a justification, that is just how my reality is. On top of that sometimes you don't even need what I have, your life can just be a living hell hole and its just a coping skill you pick up. I was able to get out of this habit and now I'm being anchored back into it. I don't want to sink again. Being in that black hole is terrifying because I have no idea when I will get back out. I'm too close to the edge and no amount of my cognitive therapy and finally going back on medication is helping take off the pressure. I am attempting to address the issue in therapy tomorrow. I just need some comforting and reassuring words. Also I apologize for this huge block of text. I just need to empty my very full head.

When she told me this, I made a decision to stop. I had to, for her sake.

But I relapsed, which was pretty selfish of me. \n\nSo then a couple days ago I thought fuck it, I'll tell her I've been self harming (before this she had no idea that I ever had). When I told her she freaked out. She blamed herself and I'm so afraid she's relapsed too, which won't help anything. She's replying slightly faster, so I guess in that sense it's helped, and I have been cutting less since I told her. \n\nBut then the other day I saw a couple cuts on her arm, but it turned out they were from her dogs (I trust her on this, her dogs are quite rough and I've seen them scratch people before so I don't think she's trying to cover up any self harm).

That hurt really bad. 0/10 don't try. I made a discord server with just me in it called the Hurt Zone. When I harm like that in an eyecatching way i post it there to document, fun stuffs.

I tried telling her that I was feeling guilty about cutting and it feels like she just said \"nah it's fine\" so it's hard for me to like, feel motivated to not do it again, if that makes any sense.

{"post_id": "bud5i1", "created_utc": 1559127278, "title": "PSA: Looking after it.", "author": "Liquid_Is_A_Paper", "self_text": "\\[Mods gave permission to post\\]\n\nBeen looking up stuff on how to take care of fresh cuts/burns, also spoke to a few nurses/doctors about it (they don't know why, I just asked \"out of curiosity\"), and they all say pretty much the same thing:\n\n# Cuts:\n\nFresh cuts should be kept covered for 4-5 days. First put pressure on for a few minutes, then clean the area/check for debris and apply dressings.Dressings/plasters/bandaids/whatever should be changed at MINIMUM once after the first 24 hours, but really they should be changed every day or every two days.\n\nAfter day 4 or 5, leave dressings off so that the area can get air and finish healing.\n\nIf the cut does not stop bleeding within 15 minutes, and/or is pumping/spurting blood out periodically, **SEEK IMMEDIATE URGENT MEDICAL ATTENTION, YOU'VE HIT A MAJOR ARTERY.**\n\nIf the cut is deep and near/on a joint, and/or you can see fat (weird bubbly stuff, different to styro/dermis), **SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION. If you have hit fat DO NOT SUPERGLUE IT. Normal glues are very different to hospital glues, and whilst going to A&amp;E is scary, superglue in cuts is** ***incredibly*** **dangerous.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Burns:\n\nFirst cool the area by either running under cool (not *cold*; don't want to cool it too quickly) or applying a cool wet flannel or similar for minimum 5 minutes, generally 10-15 minutes. DO NOT break blisters, as they are there to protect you against infection. If a blister breaks by itself, clean the area with water, no soap. Don't use ice or cotton, these increase damage hugely.\n\nAfter the area is cooled, apply lotion such as aloe vera or a moisturizer. Then antibiotic cream if you have it.\n\nDON'T hugely cover or immediately cover the area. This is apparently the #1 mistake people make: immediately or heavily covering the area causes heat left over from the burn to be trapped in the skin, increasing damage, causing severe pain (particularly damage and pain to areas deep underneath the skin) and increasing healing time.\n\nInstead, wait a few hours and continue to apply lotion. Then cover with a LOOSE gauze (that doesn't put pressure on the area), which should be taken off for an hour each day and should be replaced frequently. Whenever it's taken off, apply more moisturizer.\n\nIf the burn causes the skin to look leathery and/or white and/or waxy, is deep, has charring or is near a joint, then **regardless** of the pain levels **SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION, THIS IS A 3RD DEGREE BURN.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Bruises\n\nMost of the time, bruising is not serious and will go away on its own. If it's more painful than usual or raised, holding a cold flannel or an ice pack to the area reduces swelling and pain. Hold the ice pack to the area for about 20 minutes at a time, then take it off for 20-30 minutes before repeating.\n\nAs the bruise heals, there's not much you can do to speed it up to be honest. But there are a few things to make it a less painful/easier experience. After applying the ice pack, you can bandage the bruise with *some* tightness \\[not too much, don't want to constrict it\\], which limits the amount of blood leaking under the skin. You should also try to raise the bruised area so it is above the heart; for example, lying down with your leg on some pillows, or sitting with your arm resting above your head for a couple hours. (Note: RESTING. Not just holding your arm or leg up for hours on end. Use cushions or pillows).\n\n**AVOID ASPIRIN OR IBUPROFEN**, these thin the blood and can increase bruising. A good medication to reduce bruising pain is Tylenol.\n\nThe bandage can be kept on for about a week, though it's best to change it at least once during this time and take it off for washing.\n\nIf a bruise swells a lot or is very painful, does not improve in 2 weeks, or does not disappear in 3 weeks, then SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION.\n\nIf there is major bruising, and/or, extreme pain, and/or lots of swelling, and/or a weird \"crunching\" feeling in the area, **SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION, YOU MAY HAVE BROKEN A BONE.**\n\nIf you ever believe that you may have broken a bone with the bruise, even if it doesn't meet the points I put, then go and see a doctor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd of course if you're ever worried about any type of injury, regardless of whether it meets any criteria in this post, seek medical attention. Better to be cautious and check than get something infected or permanently damaged.\n\nTake care of yourselves, people. I know you're probably gonna harm, but do it safely.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

But honestly I don\u2019t give a shit if it\u2019s culture or not, it\u2019s still a fucked up thing that not only it is accepted, but it\u2019s actually encouraged and expected. I\u2019m talking boys actually get bullied in school if their friends found out they\u2019re uncircumcised.\n\nOnwards to the trauma part (LAST CHANCE, DON\u2019T READ THIS PART IF YOU\u2019RE SENSITIVE TO TRIGGERS),  I was probably about 8 or 9 years old when my parents decided that it\u2019s about time for me to get circumcised. Naturally, I was nervous about it. But all my relatives gave me reassurance that it will only sting a bit (like being bitten by an ant or something), and that\u2019s the biggest bullshit I have ever heard in my entire life.\n\nThe thing is, my mother doesn\u2019t trust total anesthesia out of fear that I won\u2019t wake up from the surgery. So we went with local anesthesia, which means I will be awake for the whole surgery and I supposedly won\u2019t feel a thing on a part of my body. At that age I wasn\u2019t aware of how that works.\n\nSo I was unpleasantly surprised when the doctor stuck syringe needles twice to my penis. And that\u2019s not even the bad part.\n\nThe doctor decided to execute the surgery before the anesthetic before it even fully took effect. I expressed my concern but the doctor told me \u201cyou\u2019ll be fine\u201d.\n\nLong story short, I felt the whole thing; and it\u2019s just every bit as excruciating as you might expect. I felt like I was going to die, and because I was just a very young kid not exactly knowing what\u2019s going on, it was terrifying. I screamed and cried, and what did the doctor say? He just deadass yelled me to shut up.\n\nEver since then, I became oddly tolerant to pain and I don\u2019t really flinch much whenever I SH for example, because any other pain which I had so far experienced pales in comparison to that incident. But on the other hand, I developed an irrational fear of needles. Not to mention, I really feel like shit knowing that this was done to me and I have no say to refuse about it because it\u2019s already the societal norm. And just because of a norm, I have to get all this childhood trauma and the haunting realization that I probably won\u2019t be able to experience sex the way it supposed to be naturally because of this stupid modification.\n\nEven my mom who was there got second-hand trauma, I remember one time the event was brought up in a conversation and she told me not to mention or remind her of that anymore; my screams still haunt her dreams apparently.\n\nThe thing is, where I grew up, body modifications is something very frowned upon. Tatoos and certain piercings are generally very stigmatized and viewed under negative light, you can imagine what happens when someone is seen with self-harm scars. I just find it incomprehensible that something as fucked up as child circumcision, which is done without personal consent, is expected and even encouraged in the society while you can get a lot of shit for having tattoos.\n\nI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s \u201cculture\u201d, something\u2019s very WRONG with a culture if this sort of shit is widely accepted.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Nobody seemed to have an answer, but someone said they also wondered. I found out today so I thought I\u2019d tell you all. \n\nBasically, bruising is present when there is apparently large amount of bleeding or it\u2019s damaged deeper tissues. The article doesn\u2019t seem to state how deep. This doesn\u2019t feel like the case though. So I dug a bit deeper. Apparently repeated injuries in a particular area can cause blood vessels to inflame and bruise easier. So it doesn\u2019t take much. Also factors such as anaemia can mean you bruise quicker. People losing a lot of wait/are on a diet (or suffering from an eating disorder, as I know some do here) can also affect whether you bruise or not. Now I feel anaemia probably plays a bit. I lose a fair bit of blood daily. Perhaps it\u2019s not so bad once a week, but daily, sometimes multiple times daily, is probably slowly making me anaemic. From what I\u2019ve learnt in Health And Social, a lot of people become slightly anaemic on their periods purely based on the fact they\u2019re losing blood. So I\u2019m willing to bet that\u2019s playing a part, at least for me. Prolonged blood loss, however slow, can cause anaemia. \n\nSo that\u2019s that. You probably didn\u2019t want to know. Probably didn\u2019t need to know. But I\u2019d thought I\u2019d share it with you anyway, it was interesting reading. If anybody is suspecting anaemia, is suggest a blood test. I\u2019m deathly afraid of needles (can\u2019t even think about them without becoming faint, it\u2019s okay though I was already faint so this is Fine), so I\u2019m avoiding it. I need to at some point. Last time i was checked for blood problems it showed I had pretty much no vitamin D. Don\u2019t be like me. Unless you cut your arm, in which case, perhaps it is easier to be like me unless you Really, Really are suffering from symptoms.

It was like an orgasm of pain. But then I started to feel invalid/like my pain wasn\u2019t real because I didn\u2019t cut. I felt like since I didn\u2019t express my pain in the right way then my pain wasn\u2019t worthy of help, so I lived a lonely and isolating life of a burning self harm. \n\nThen I started cutting so I would feel worthy, then I started to feel invalid because it wasn\u2019t \u2018deep enough\u2019. So I\u2019d cut myself over fifty times per session just to try and be as severe. \n\nNow I\u2019m so tempted to cut deeper. I brought myself some new blades and it\u2019s like slicing through butter-hurts so much less than my old, rusty and crusty scalpel. \n\nI tend to go long periods without self harm, but when I relapse I relapse hard. And I love the scars they leave-it\u2019s like proof my pain is real. \n\nBut I\u2019ve told myself I wouldn\u2019t berate a friend for not cutting deep enough, I\u2019d instead console them and try to get them to quit with love and support. So that helps with my whole \u2018not cutting deep enough\u2019 issue. \n\nRubber bands and ice cubes never worked for me, but tattoos and drawing \u2018cuts\u2019 on myself in red sharpie help. With tattoos I get the pain but with art at the end instead of scars. The red sharpie gives me the visual stimulation. \n\nFor me I self harm mostly for seeing my own blood, which makes me feel alive, the scars at the end which prove my pain is real. But I don\u2019t want to live this way anymore, self harm never helped my pain-only complicated it. \n\nI hope my story helped someone.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Since the emotional pain was so intense it didn\u2019t help out right away, but I don\u2019t even know if cutting would\u2019ve helped out right away for this either, but I think it helped the painful feelings go away a little bit quicker than they normally would\u2019ve.

My parents know I have scars too but they don't know I still actively struggle with it, and seeing scars on someone else is extremely triggering to me. My mum isn't okay with me wearing shorts sleeves around my sister because it could trigger her. I get it because she's young and she's finally doing better in her revovery, but the whole situation is just extremely complex and unfair in my eyes. It's not that I seriously want to wear short sleeves because I get it that my sister needs to be protected, but at the same time I just don't feel seen and validated in my struggle.

I truly don't care if no one reads this I just need to write it down.\n\nYesterday, I had to go to the hospital for a visit and the doctor noticed my scars. I am 20, but I have never been independent. Both my parents came to the hospital with me. The doctor who visited me is a friend of my mom. I also live in a country where health care is not as expensive as in other countries.\n\nDuring the visit my mom stayed with me, but I asked her to go out before she could see my cuts. It was all very sudden but I didn't know what else to do. The doctor noticed and she also noticed my cuts.\n\nWe talked and she basically said that if I didn't comply and talk to a psychiatrist immediately she would tell it to my parents. I said I didn't want to talk to anyone and that I was pretty sure she didn't have the right to tell anything to my parents as I am of age. However she persisted, she said she HAD to do something because otherwise it'd be UNETHICAL and I didn't know if I could trust her or not. So in the end I said ok.\n\nMy parents didn't know anything. She brought me to a psychiatrist and I talked to him for an hour and 10 minutes maybe. He said I need therapy and help and he basically suspects that I have depression and anxiety. I don't think I said much about my problems but apparently I need the same antidepressants that my grandma takes. My grandma who has dementia and anxiety.\n\nI said I didn't want to go to therapy and that I didn't want to tell my parents anything of this meeting. However that can't be done because the doctors have to report these things, obviously. So I had to comply once again. However he lied to my parents. He lied, he told them I only have some anxiety problems, he booked a visit to a psychologist without NO ONE asking and he wrote that I need antidepressants. A bit too much for someone who has \"anxiety\" right? Right.\n\nSo now my parents keep asking what the fuck happened and I don't want to give them any explaination. They've been treating me like they treat my grandma, like I'm a pathetic human being who whines too much, they want to check every two seconds and I feel suffocated. And I'm scared. Because they don't know about the scars but they fucking analyzed bit by bit the doctor's report and they don't understand why he prescribed antidepressants. (Which they don't want me to take btw and I'm grateful for that because I wouldn't want to take them either). But they could ask. They could ask to see my arm and what the fuck would I do then? I can't hide them. I don't have make up or anything to cover them with. They'd know why they want me to take antidepressants. They'd want to talk...\n\nI'm scared and I don't know what to do. My parents don't really think mental illnesses are real illnesses, they joke about them and use them as insults, they used to call me bipolar and autistic far too many times when I was younger (\"our daughter must be autistic, her behaviour is so rude, why can't we have a normal daughter?\" or \"she's bipolar for sure, she's not normal, she's crazy\"). They also believe that whichever problems you have, they are caused by external factors (so chemical imbalances are a myth) and you should just deal with this factor and then everything goes away. My mother talked to me about an hour ago and she said this thing exactly and that someone who doesn't want to get out of an uncomfortable situation is just weak and \"is not trying hard enough\".\n\nI want to fucking disappear. I don't want the help I need while I still live with my parents. I can't do that. If they knew everything they would also think it's their fault that I feel suicidal. It happened with the psychiatrist as well. He said I have anxiety and they went \"ah, I knew it was our fault\". They always say that. I'm not a good daughter, I'm not the daughter they want, why can't they have a normal daughter? Why can't I be perfect? they should have tried harder... \n\nI'm tired. I feel suffocated. I don't remember a time in which I wasn't. I didn't really have any freedom before even over my own body but at least I could cut myself. At least I had that. Not anymore I guess. And as it was the only way to calm myself down completely now I won't even know what to do when I'll panic.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

If you go to an interview, you have to wear long sleeves (If you have cuts on your arms) and you can't work a job that requires you to wear short sleeves (such as nursing, since the patients find the scars \"disturbing\" and you may be terminated because of these complaints, and even though this is considered an act of discrimination, good luck proving that is what it was). You'll also be barred from jobs such as being a fireman or police officer. \n       You'll never be treated the same as when you didn't have scars, people will straight up avoid you or pity you to the point of them not even seeing you as another human being anymore. Plus, once you begin, it's so hard to stop, and even when you do, you'll have the scars to follow you for the rest of your life. So please, consider the professional consequences before you take the blade to yourself, and if you are already cutting, please stop before the scars become too deep.

It's been in the back of head for the past few months.\n\nI started SHing my sophomore year of high school and continued until sometime in late junior year. I was clean for a few years, basically. Recently though I was hospitalised for mental health reasons (discovered I have major depressive disorder, had a breakdown) and I relapsed using my fingernails in a hospital bathroom. If I'd remembered to bring my knife, I absolutely would've destroyed my arms, I'm sure, but then they put me in the red scrubs and took away anything I could use to hurt myself.\n\nI'm on meds now for the depression and my OCD and other disorders, so I'd like to be clear: this isn't borne of any kind of sadness. I feel great, unironically. I'm loving my life basically. But I guess I've always just...identified, if that makes sense, with having a huge amount of deep-ish scars. I really like the way they look when they go keloid and get all purple-y and big. I hope that doesn't sound insensitive to any of you.\n\nMy upper and forearms are covered in scars, but the majority aren't keloid scars, is the thing. I was always too afraid to do anything super deep, and I am *not* suicidal. Even during my worst cutting days, I never had the drive to slit my wrists or anything. It's just on my arms, for the same reason anybody cuts.\n\nSo I guess...I'm asking if anyone has any better way of looking at my scars. I want them to be the way I always \"imagined\" them, I guess, but I never got to the point where they would look like that. I kind of halted my \"progress\", although that sounds horrible to say it like that.\n\nLike, if I could cut myself a whole damn bunch right now and my friends would just be like \"ok cool\" and my parents wouldn't notice, I absolutely would. I don't even fully understand why, so I would love to hear some perspective about like...why I shouldn't do it. Because I know, rationally, that it makes little sense. I'm not sad, suicidal, or even depressed anymore, but I want the scars! Argh. It's so frustrating and I feel silly even typing this out.\n\nI'm sorry if I come off as entitled or like, the worst kind of first world problems lol. It's a hard thing to articulate, and I mean this genuinely when I say that I'm not trying to offend or be insensitive to people who have been through this. You're all awesome.

How can I help her.", "author": "J_UK_2019", "self_text": "  \n\nWe discovered my younger daughter\u2019s  self harm some 3 months ago. I self harmed in the past, long ago and undetected by those close to me at the time, but my harm was never to the prolonged systematic extent of my daughter. She\u2019s 13.\n\nI understand that it helps to cope, I want to address the dark thoughts  that makes it necessary. Remove the motive, resolve the problem, is what I believe.\n\nWe have engaged professional counsellors, but as her father how can I best show her that I love her exactly as she is and support her on this journey.\n\nDetail:\n\nHer elder sibling is a high academic achiever and slim and fit. My younger is a capable student and I am proud of her , her public face is the light of our life. But she feels she's \"not good enough\", and end of day withdraws to her room and punishes herself. Ending life has been considered.\n\nWe moved state and then country in the first 10 year, settled now in a good community. Maybe some need to fit in with new peer groups adds pressure etc.\n\nI thought we had a breakthrough when she came out to me as liking girls and I and my wife have 100% supported her. \"Be happy\" was our message, this is just part of the richness of variety of human life. I myself have many gay friends, my daughter knows this, they come for dinner, they're good mates. My wife is OK with this, but her religious background gives my daughter cause for concern about her acceptance.\n\nSelf-harmers at young teen: what words or actions might have helped to make you like yourself more and reduce the self-harming? \n\nMany questions: any resources or personal anecdotes shared would help to educate us to do it right.\n\nTHANK YOU FOR ALL ADVICE.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}
