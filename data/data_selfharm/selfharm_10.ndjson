She called today to tell me I would be approved If I chose the rehab route. So my questions are, have any of you been to rehab for selfharm? If so what was your experience, did it help you, do you still feel cravings to do it?", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I come up against something i just can't process or handle and out come the razors.  It used to just be a quick thing, one and done.  Lately its turned into several over a day or so.  They're never very deep, I'm too much of a coward.  Just enough to leave a scar.  Luckily(?), i have a job where little cuts on the hands and arms are pretty routine, so i don't even have to hide it.  Just my little way to get release when I'm overwhelmed. \nFew days ago i had an arguement with the wife (we're in our early 40s) and it was pretty real.  Had some painful things pointed out to me.  She suffers from depression and anxiety (mild to moderate) and I've always felt as her husband its my job to comfort and protect her.  Faced with the fact that I haven't been doing such a great job, I immediately resorted to hurting myself.  I spent 20 minutes crying in the shower because i know how fucked up I am and how pathetic it is that instead of facing and overcoming challenges and problems, i run away and hurt myself to feel better.  \nShe deserves better.  And i want to fix myself so i can be the strong capable husband she needs.  I know i can't beat this without help.  I don't know what to do.  My birthday is coming up in less than a week, and the last few years I've given myself a few scars as a presents to myself.  I'm ready to be done with this shit.  I can't bring myself to tell her about all this.  I'm too proud.  I'm supposed to be her rock.  If I go to the doctor and tell them about the cutting, are they going to think I'm suicidal? (I'm not).  Are they going to try to admit me to a facility?  I've thought about going on welbutrin to quit smoking, maybe I could just do that and the pills will help me cope with stress better so that i don't cut anymore?  \nIdeally i could handle this without her knowing about the cutting.  It's like this dark ugly secret that if she finds out will forever change how she looks at me.  I'm at my wits end and don't know where to go from here.  Any and all advice would be welcome, and thanks for reading this mess.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

There were a couple reasons I wanted to tell him first off because he\u2019s my best friend and second because I\u2019ve already come out about multiple other things to him specifically. However he\u2019s the closest person to the innocent one in my friend group so I wasn\u2019t completely sure he knew what cutting was but thought that he might have known because of my friend who I\u2019ll call Anna. Anna was pretty open about the fact that she has pretty bad depression along with a few other things along those lines and I knew that this meant that at one point or another she probably explained self harm to Cory. So with all of these things considered I started thinking of the best way to tell him, so what I had finally decided on doing was saying something along the lines of \u201cI have some good news and some bad news and I\u2019m gonna need you to keep an open mind\u201d. so any skipping past 2 hours of anxiety, lunch comes around and I have my mind set on telling Cory so I sit down where I usually meet up with him I wait a minute and then I see him coming towards the table and have a mini anxiety attack. he gets to the table and... he had to go. So feeling slightly defeated I go to where Anna usually hangs out and I told her by saying I was two weeks clean, and she a little bit shocked by it but she mostly just congratulated me on being two weeks clean and after a pretty awkward conversation between the two of us she eventually sees Cory out of the corner of her eye and tells me I should probably go tell him if I haven\u2019t. So I go get Cory and ask him where he was and start walking him back to where me and Anna were hanging out and when we got there I told him \u201cI have some good news and some bad news but you have to keep an open mind\u201d he said ok and I took off my wristband and told him I was two weeks clean and at first he reacted in a way that was a mix between worry, confusion and denial but I honestly expected his reaction to be 100 times worse than it ended up being so it honestly went pretty well, and with Anna\u2019s help we managed to talk him down pretty quickly and of course he had some questions but at least he didn\u2019t ask me to draw a fucking butterfly or some shit. So all in all it went pretty well and as I was walking to my ride home I ran into him and we talked about something stupid for a minute or two and he ended the conversation by saying something like \u201clet\u2019s work on making it to three weeks\u201d and that was really cool of him and I\u2019m so glad that I have people I can talk to face to face about my self harm.\nTLDR: I told some friends about my self harm and I\u2019m so happy that I did", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

{"post_id": "dcup9v", "created_utc": 1570126241, "title": "How I stayed clean for 4 years (in unhealthy ways) and then relapsed", "author": "4yearsalive", "self_text": "Welcome to my tedx talk, now come with me on my stupid fucking journey\n\n\nTldr: I quit sh cause of a codependent-relationship which eventually ended terribly, I managed to stay clean for ~2 years after that happened, then relapsed cause of lonely circumstances + falling into a familiar dark place (missing that ex-S/O)\n\n\n-I was in a co-dependent relationship where my gf cared a lot about me not having any more scars. Tbh telling myself that sh was 'cringey', that my gf deserved better, and that my parents deserved better were the most significant thought processes that I used to dodge cravings. I used the same half-truths method for quitting cigarettes recently, so maybe that method has some merit. I also \"tapered\" off, by using more un-noticible parts of my body for the last week before I quit. I found no luck tapering off the severity of the sh, so in that way I quit cold-turkey. \r\n\n\n-I immediately started smoking more weed, habitually multiple times a day, as a replacement for sh. Apparently doesn\u2019t happen to everyone, but I get bad weed withdrawals, so it\u2019s quite an addictive habit. \r\n\n\n-unexpected traumatic events in both of our lives led to an ugly end to the relationship\r\n\n\n-I was in an incredibly tough spot, felt suicidal every day, and didn\u2019t care about much of anything besides trying to reconnect the relationship (even though I knew that a relationship where I'd been physically abused would never be good for me)\r\n\n\n-immediately after the breakup, I got into a major argument with a few friends in my friend-group, and it escalated to me falling out with everyone in the group. From my perspective, this was all over one guy calling me a faggot (I was 2 weeks out of the closet as bi), and 3 people would defend him, but nobody else would defend me, so I felt mad at the whole group. but I think that me being in very poor mental health and starting to smoke cigs, and the peer pressure to ostracize me, contributed a lot to the rest of my friends deciding to not talk to me anymore (not answering my messages) \r\n\n\n-I somehow decided that I\u2019m not gonna relapse, I couldn\u2019t focus on caring about the future though, so I started smoking tobacco with my weed (mostly so that I could afford my smoking habit)\r\n\n\n-dropped out of 1st semester of University, cause my personal life was shattered. After dropping out I experienced violence in my home (which I never thought could happen)\r\n\n\n-smoking weed and tobacco kept me from feeling too suicidal, but the habit and my mindset at the time that was caused by all the sudden trauma led to me lashing out at my family and therapist every time we would speak.\r\n\n\n-I was hospitalized twice at this point, it was all in the details, but the summary is that I was very verbally aggressive because nobody would tell me how I got there or when I could go home (I lost a lot of memory from the forced anti-psychotics combined with the forced benzodiazepines: most short term memories where totally unreachable). I was put in a solitary cell 24/7 (not the hospital\u2019s usual policy apparently), and I\u2019d go to the toilet in Styrofoam cups because nobody would answer the buzzer. My personal experience was extremely, extremely scary, lonely, and depressing at the time. My parents wouldn\u2019t confirm that my then-recent traumatic-experiences were true to the doctors, but I suspect that this was because of leading questions, or cognitive dissonance on their part. so the psychologist described me as psychotic (hallucinations + manic symptoms), and would leave immediately (for 24h )if I argued at all with what he said. So I ended up deciding to lie about myself and my past to get out of the hospital both times (\u201cno, there\u2019s no problems at home, and no, I feel totally fine now\u201d: I would just repeat that for 4 days in a row and then I\u2019m released from inpatient).\r\n\n\n-I struggled to live a normal life while on a high-dose of antipsychotic. I eventually switched psychiatrists and was allowed to taper off the meds. That made a big difference in my mood and life (cause I had such bad side effects).\r\n-been ~1.5 years off the meds now, 6 weeks clean from tobacco, over 2 years since I had issues with (prescribed) benzodiazepines, and 4 weeks into a new college. I gotta admit that my circumstances are much better and healthier now after all my hard work, it's still hard to cope often, but it's progress. My depression is just a circumstancial way to cope with intense anxieties (mostly about failing at everything). So it is nice to only deal with my anxiety disorder most of the time.\r\n\n\n-I relapsed to sh this week cause of unmanageable social and school-work stress, combined with being home alone for this week (no family to talk to, and my parents \u2018stole\u2019 my dog: haha) and my close friend wasn\u2019t available to talk. Being alone and using every available coping mechanism to no avail made me not care about breaking my 4 year streak.\r\n\n\n-I used to sh before bed to get to sleep on weeknights, I relapsed for the same reason: cause I spent as much time as I could doing homework, barely finished, and was panicking cause I only had 4h to sleep before school, I didn\u2019t want to waste any time getting to sleep and I really wanted some emotional relief. Usually I\u2019m able to get relief from a healthier alternative (or smoking weed) but it didn\u2019t work: and I think that\u2019s cause my mind was flooded with the good times I had spent with my ex (I haven\u2019t talked to her in 2 years). That\u2019s really rare for me to think about, let alone dwell on, but I think that my recent failure to get a second date with a girl I liked, and my lonely circumstances really worsened the isolated and depressed feelings.\r\n\n\n-dogs are my only good advise for an  anxiety disorder and or trauma. My new dog really really helps with negative emotions, and it doesn\u2019t even feel like work to go and pet the doggy (compared to meditation, exercise, conscious mental exercises etc.) people always talk about having a dog to take care of, but it more helps me because of how much he cares about me. He\u2019s always excited to see me, and get in my lap, whether I\u2019m crying or panicking or feeling just fine. He really cares about me, and puts more effort into understanding me then most humans haha. And he\u2019ll get up 24/7 for me whenever I leave my bedroom, just cause he loves spending time with me. Humans aren\u2019t even capable of loving you as much as a dog can. They\u2019re truly, truly special, and I wouldn\u2019t have been able to get back into college without his help.", "subreddit": "MadeOfStyrofoam"}

{"post_id": "dda549", "created_utc": 1570208483, "title": "My ex ruined my life by convincing me my SH was a sex thing", "author": "operation-quartz", "self_text": "I just sort of had this realization and really wanted to get it off my chest somewhere.\n\nFor context: I've had self-harm issues since I was about 14, in 2012. I met my ex in winter 2018, when he was a senior in college and I was a junior. I was in the middle of a gender transition and was feeling insecure and desperate for validation; when he messaged me asking to meet up and get tea (he was an old freshman year classmate whom I'd always had a bit of a crush on) I was thrilled.\n\nWhen we met, I was in the middle of a bit of a depressive episode, and had been thinking a lot about hurting myself already -- this is why I guess it didn't trigger red flags when he started talking about his self-harm fantasies (notably, not actual self-harm -- just elaborate fantasies). I commiserated, saying that I thought about injuring myself too. His next response was to suggest this was part of my sexuality.\n\nI don't know why I accepted this so readily -- possibly because self-harm has always been closely associated with my gender identity, or possibly just because I was infatuated with him and was willing to listen to whatever he said. Either way, it became a fixture in our relationship that he and I were both blood fetishists. He encouraged me to look up erotic art of people being hurt or killed as part of \"exploring my sexuality\", and convinced me to let him cut me. I consented to all of this and told myself I enjoyed it. He didn't do anything nonconsensual or illegal.\n\nMy mental health experienced an absolutely precipitous decline and I went from being a reasonably confident student with some psych issues to constantly abusing drugs and alcohol, cutting frequently, and being essentially academically incapable over the course of a couple of months. I really wasn't willing to put two and two together and was still happy at the time that I had \"figured myself out\", and was convinced that this just sort of happened to people like me.\n\nEven after we broke up, this continued to be the framework through which I saw my self-harm. It was a sex thing for me, and I was a fetishist, and therefore I a) cut because I wanted to and enjoyed it, and b) needed to avoid people who cut for other reasons because I didn't want to upset or encourage them. I started cutting to deep styro, then fat, then deep fat, needed stitches several times, was hospitalized twice, and essentially ruined my body over the course of a year, but had no framework to process this beyond \"I like blood I guess\". I purposely stayed out of recovery- or support-oriented groups (so as not to hurt the people in them) and tried to hang out in gore communities instead for emotional support, which obviously didn't really work. Meeting other people who self-harmed terrified me, because I was afraid that they would find me out and judge me.\n\nA couple of days ago I finally convinced myself to join a support-oriented group chat, which was a huge relief. I realized that seeing other people self-harm and talking to them about it was not at all a sexual experience for me, and that in fact I was actually really happy to try to help others and myself recover, and to treat cutting unambiguously as an unhealthy, unwanted addiction. That led to questioning the framework my ex had given me, etc., etc. I think I'm significantly closer to recovery than I was even a day or two ago, but I'm really mad about that past year.\n\nI'm not sure how much of this was his fault and how much was mine. I did go along with most of his suggestions and never really protested or questioned what he was saying -- I'm certainly not claiming that he forced me into anything or broke any laws. At the same time, I was in a really vulnerable position and I very much doubt he had my best interests at heart.\n\nFor clarification, I do think it's entirely possible to have a healthy blood/guro/whatever fetish and I don't want to judge people who do. But like fuck my ex lol\n\nThank you for reading!", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

After cleaning the graphite off the sharpener/razor it served as an excellent tool, cutting deeply and cleanly. So I'm sitting in a chair with blood dripping down my arms, and after like 14 tissues I realized the bleeding would not stop anytime soon. So I stupidly trusted a peer and asked for around 4-5 bandaids. Unsurprisingly, he proceeded to tell a teacher, who then called the guidance counselor, who called the vice principal.

FriendGuy is fresh out of an abusive relationship, and said that he had started to miss the bruises that his girlfriend used to leave him, so he would pinch and jab at his skin for long periods of times to replicate the pain that his girlfriend used to cause him because it helped him to not feel so alone. \nFriendGuy is known to be a bit dramatic, but I don't judge because we all grieve differently. \nHe was kind of beating himself up tonight and calling himself crazy for doing these things to himself.

My dad on the other hand, still no clue if he wanted me but we'll talk about that later. My mom and dad never lived together and already had a child before hand, so they were had a history of yelling at eachother over dumb reasons. My mom was an alcoholic who was also a complete nut job with no regard to who she hurt or how she hurt them, I live with her up till the age of 4 but in the time I lived with her a lot of bad things have happened. I barely have any good memories with her because all I can remember is being slapped, punched and her trying to kill me on many occasions. She used to try and drown me in the bathtub, she also hit me in the head with very heavy objects. she hit me so hard with a slipper once it popped a blood vessel in my left leg and caused what is called a subdural hematoma and even to this day it's still here causing me pain\n\n4 years of this goes by and that was only part of it. In this time my mother gave birth to my brother, and he was the only thing I cared about there. It got to the point I didn't even know how bad it was until I started to see how my brother who wasn't even 1 year old yet was being treated. We were barely fed and we usually went to bed hungry (brother since he was a baby he would just cry all night) and even then sleeping was the only way to make the pain go away. But even sleeping was bad, I didn't have any sort of bed, I slept on a singular thin blanket on the freezing cold floor with not even a pillow.\n\nOne day my mom dropped us off to go see our Father who was taking care of our sister for the past 5 years. My sister and him were the happiest 2 people this world has ever seen, always a big bright smile on their faces. That is until my mom never showed up to pick us up. A day passed, nothing. Then 2.... Nothing. Then a week, and my dad suddenly realized that he now has to take care of 2 more kids in a one bedroom apartment because my mom wasn't coming back. That was the last day my dad wasn't under stress for a long time. So my dad now had a bunch of things on his plate, he had to get me into kindergarten, find my little brother a daycare, take care of us in a 1 bedroom apartment, work near minimum wage, while the nice life my sister had disappeared in front of her eyes. \n\nFlash forward a year as I entered grade 1 I had the responsibility already to make lunch and breakfast for the family. Barely had any money for groceries. Usually parents do most of the cleaning while the kids have maybe a chore or 2 to do, but not us, we had to make sure the whole house was clean. I did the dishes, bathroom, hallway, bedroom and living room at the age of 6 and never got any praise or reward for it. \n\nAnother year into living like this, with my dad under alot of stress finally hit a snapping point and resorted to some....... Physical means of getting me to listen. He left my sister and brother alone but I was his target, he has beat me, slapped me and when he got really angry he would grab me by the throat and slam me into a wall and hold me there while yelling in my face and my brain snapped and ever since then I've been getting anxiety attacks whenever he even raises his voice. At this point I'm making dinner, cleaning and shopping for groceries mostly on my own and with no friends, or family I can trust with nobody to talk to about anything so I bottled everything up for many years to come.\n\nNow I'm in grade 6, still doing everything for my family. And my dad this time got really angry and just basically punched me and told me that I am a worthless piece of shit who doesn't matter to him or anyone, and it broke me. And I believe that was the first time I self harmed, it was on my upper legs and I just grabbed a knife and just pressed it hard and cut a big cut on it. And throughout time my self harm would grow to other parts of the body. My dad always got mad and shouted when I talked about my mental health. So I never have anyone to talk too about it\n\nSecond to last time jump\nNow we arrive to grade 8, my first year of highschool and at this point I thought that my life wouldn't get any better so I almost did what I thought I'd never bring myself to do, I went to the bridge that's known for suicide and just sat on the edge of it for a good 15 minutes thinking \"hey it's not like anyone would care\" but just before I did my brain thought \"hold the fuck up, you are only 13. You've got a whole lot more life to live\" and I got down from the edge and just went home completely silent in my head not thinking of anything and the moment I got onto my bed (crappy bed that hurts my back and it's not even an inch thick) I started crying and didn't stop crying for a few hours. Nobody in my house cared so they all just minded their own Business. Later in the year I met this very lovely person whole we will just call OF (only friend) who showed me that there are good people in this world who will listen to you and show you that you mean something, I can never tell you how grateful I am to have OF in my life and she was the only person I looked forward talking to everytime I woke up\n\nFast forward to the end of grade 9 and I start to know people I can trust and talk to about this and stuff to. And OF confessed that they loved me and I couldn't have been happier, so OF was now my girlfriend and she is the only thing that makes me wanna carry on, she has showed me that I mean something and that I have a place in the world and without her I probably wouldn't be alive. Now grade 10 rolls around and I'm starting to talk about this crappy life story to adults who can help me. \n\nThis is the end of my story so far cause I'm still going through these troubles and I still self harm but I'm getting much better. And I'm so glad that I have people I can trust in my life and I feel like everything is going to start getting better soon\n\nDisclaimer, there is a lot more to this story but if I added it I don't think you'd ever hear the end of it and most of the topics are a little sensitive to me so I don't feel like sharing. I hope you understand\n\n(If this has alot of missing holes or has any poor grammer, please forgive me I've been typing for while now and didn't want to proof read and correct it)", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I just feel like telling my story, I don't really know what I expect from this post, but I have never told these things to anyone and I feel safe placing it here.\n\n\nThe first time I came into contact with self harm was when I was 15. I was struggling big time with my sexual orientation and felt really isolated, it was my way of coping with all the fears and feelings of guilt I had at the time. I self harmed on a regular basis, it was almost a daily thing for me. That lasted for about a year, maybe 2, I don't really quite remember. When I was getting more comfortable with my sexuality, it kind of just decreased until a point when it only happened every few months or so, mainly when I was feeling stressed or very guilty about something.\n\n\nI am 22 now, and self harm is now something that returns only a couple of times a year. I also noticed that the last 4 years or so, it mainly happens during the fall/winter months. Usually, from the middle of October onwards, I start feeling really down, and when deadlines and exams at university start approaching, I get really stressed. Often during those times I lose control and the urges to self harm return. I always feel really guilty afterwards, but I always have a reason to justify my selfharm, if that makes sense. It's because I'm stressed, so I can forgive myself and move on.\n\n\nMy problem now is that this year is different. I have been feeling down since the beginning of September already, and the last 3 weeks or so I have a building urge to self harm, but this time I don't see why. I am not stressed at all, it's only the beginning of the academic year, no deadlines in sight, and overall my life is going really well. I don't want to give in to this urge, because I'll have no way of justifying it for myself. It's just really frustrating and it keeps me up at night, making me really tired and feel even worse. I don't know how to stop this cycle and friends have, for the first time, been picking up on my low mood.\n\n\n\nAs I said, I don't really know what I want to get out of this post, I guess I just want someone to listen...\n\n\nAlso, I feel like my self harm is not 'real' as it's never been really bad or dangerous, they are basically just scratches on my skin. This is also why I am afraid of opening up to friends about this issue, because I'm scared they won't take me seriously or something and think it's embarrassing. But I'm also really embarrassed about the fact that I self harm in the first place, so idk...", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

(I'm on mobile so sorry in advance). \n\nI'll try to keep certain things vague cuz I don't want to end up hurting anyone but basically my relationship with my mom has been getting worse and it's freaking me out. She often goes on work trips and when she's gone I really feel better, but I also feel like I'm an awful child for feeling that way and she always flips things around to be my fault and I just don't know what to do. I remember when I was younger I hid (because we were playing hide and seek) during a big get together, but when it was time to leave, I just kept hiding. I don't know why I just stayed put and even when adults came looking for me and even looked into the room I was hiding in I didn't come out until they found me. I think she was really embarrassed and just rushed to get me out of their house. I remember her ignoring me for about a week. I specifically remember calling out to her in our old kitchen and she just ignored me. I also remember she would use my brother as a threat a lot. Like when my brother was playing with my favorite toys, but I wasn't eating my vegetables, she would say that I don't deserve anything because I can't just do this one simple thing. She would also always reprimand me and yell at me in public and in front of people so now I start crying when adults raise there voices and stuff and everyone calls me a crybaby and thinks I'm too sensitive. Don't get me wrong, she still clearly cared and stuff I guess, but it always felt like my dad was the one who tried to keep things equal between me and my younger brother, though it's obvious they both favor him to this day. \n\nLast year we had to put down my 1 year old cat because she had some sort of cancer that was really rare. I loved my cat, she always cuddled with me when I cried and she liked to stay with me and to be honest it felt nice to have something or someone like me above my brother. So her death really hurt me and that combined with the fact we put her down 3 days before school started kinda set the tone for the year. \n\nAbout three months in, my childhood friend and the person I considered to be my closest friend lied to me about her parents abusing her, playing it off like her self harm scars were her parents doing. But three days later she sent me a video of her showing a \"hi\" freshly cut into her arm and then turning around to show all the other cuts on her arm, threatening suicide if me and some other friends told anyone. I freaked out and when my mom got home I told her about it and let's just say my friend ended up getting the care she needed in the hospital. She still had access to her phone though, just not a charger, so she kept spamming me with texts about how it was my fault and that I was horrible and a monster and not her real friend. I know some people might sympathise and that's fine but just... I just didn't want her to die okay. She didn't want to die either. She told us that she was getting scared she'd die during her breakdown, so I know that it was just self harm. Not her truly trying to commit suicide. \n\nSo why am I saying all this? I don't want to end up like her, if that makes sense. I already scratch myself a lot and I have really really strong urges to stab myself and cut myself and bite myself all the time. I miss going to therapy, I only was able to go for six sessions to a therapist I didn't trust (but honestly I just have trust issues with councilors in general since one time one blamed me and called an issue where a boy was bullying me the \"*my name* situation\"), but I just miss being able to talk to someone. I don't know what to do I really don't. I can't talk to anyone. I just feel so numb I don't even care about me dying anymore. I die in a lot of my dreams but recently I had a dream where I can only remember the feeling of me dying and feeling blood drain from my body but instead of the fear driving me to fight to survive I just laid there in my blood, not caring. I don't know I don't kknow I don't know what to do. I feel like no one will take me seriously until I pull a big stunt but I don't want to be like my friend. If I tell my mom she'll just say I'm accusing her of being a bad mother and twisting her words like I always do or tell me I shouldn't be complaining since there all lots of people in worse situations. My dad has no control over this sadly. I love him for not being awful but at the same time both my parents are loose canons and will sometimes just be mad over something random and stupid and will yell at me. I can't go to any councilors, all they'll do is call home and that helps nothing, I don't even trust them anyways. My friends all have the privilege of having supportive parents and I don't want to scare them away. I don't want to become the next big drama at school or within my family I just wish I could discreetly go to a therapist myself or just FUCKING DIE ALREADY. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety but it's not like anyone around me cares, for better or worse.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Now i\u2019m 19 and after not selfharming for a year, ive been feeling so much pain and not being able to manage it i have resorted to my old tendencies.\n\nThe thing is when I was a teenager, I didn\u2019t really mind most people seeing cuts or scars tbh, besides my family of course. But now that i\u2019m an adult i feel so pathetic and embarrassed. Like if anyone at work notices (im not sure if they have i wear an under shirt but have had to pull my sleeves up a few times when cleaning), im just so fucking ashamed and feel like a crazy person. How am i an adult and still doing this shit? Something is seriously wrong with me.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

An apology ahead of time .\n\nMost of you that read this , I assume you have shaken a soda can or a carbonated liquid in a bottle . This is how I would describe myself . Things happen , I get stuck in my thoughts and have no one to cry to . Why would I ? I don\u2019t want the attention . I want to feel normal . I don\u2019t want everyone to see how weak I am . But yet , I always tell people I am not as strong as they think I am . It\u2019s something that\u2019s laughed off .  \n\nWhen I first started cutting , I would do it really slow . It made me nervous. I would do it once or twice and go a long length of time without doing it . By that time those small scars would heal. \nBut lately it\u2019s different . I realized how good it feels . To be completely shaken and holding everything in to where I can let it out on myself . \nThe way I cut has become faster . Deeper . Nightly . In higher number . The more I focus on everything that is shaking me , The less it hurts .  \n\nI keep these hidden secrets , that represent every unspoken word on my upper legs , inches above the knee .  A list of excuses from my own actions , to abandonment , PTSD from physical and emotional abuse . Most of all the fear of not belonging .  \n\nBefore I decide that I\u2019m going to cut . I have been triggered . My insides feel like heavy weights . I want to cry and I can\u2019t . \nEvery time I start to cut , I scream inside and ask myself why can\u2019t I just let everything out . Why can\u2019t I cry ?  Begging myself just to do it . It sounds ridiculous .  I find myself ridiculous . Self doubt , fear , overthinking and letting my thoughts grow and run into each other . I\u2019m not high , or drinking . It\u2019s not influenced by a drug . \n\nOne thing that does influence it , is every time I shower . I don\u2019t want to shut the water off. I don\u2019t want to leave . Sitting or standing there for an hour , sometimes two . Sometimes I dry off and go right back in . It\u2019s my favorite place to cut . It\u2019s not just the beauty of watching the blood run down from each cut to the drain . It\u2019s how the warm water makes each cut feel. During and after .\n\nThat\u2019s how it was at first . Now when I step out of the shower , it usually does not stop .  . Vertical , horizontal , crossways . A cut is a cut to me.  But now it\u2019s more . Now it\u2019s my stress reliever and escape . I had tried to only understand why people did it to feel like I could understand them . \n\nNow I do it to try to understand myself . \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this . This is the first time I have posted on reddit . But I spend a lot of time reading through different subjects and reading others words. I respect everyone\u2019s time they take to share their feelings and opinions .", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I was wearing ridiculously short shorts and a white crop top (nothing I\u2019d normally wear) \nAnd blood was dripping out from under the gauze\n\nI didn\u2019t remember cutting but I knew that\u2019s what it was from.

He was right. It did cover it.\n\nHe brought me some more gauze and an ace bandage wrap thing and I re-wrapped and covered it.\n\nFor the rest of the dream I was just sitting on a couch next to him, while all of the other people at the get together thing were on a different couch laughing\n\nEvery now and then he would look over to make sure I was okay..\n\nI can\u2019t get that dream out of my head.

I was pregnant (from April until July) But I'm not anymore.. I told my parents that I was pregnant they weren't too happy with me but they weren't mad. They were very supportive and said that choice of what to do is up to me. My boyfriend also said that the choice of what to do is completely up to me. (my bf will be 18 on October 16th, Also im 19) When I first found out I was pregnant, I freaked out and I did not want to keep it. But my boyfriend did want to keep. Well I was so stressed out that I was pregnant, that I ended up being put in another mental hospital, before they took me and they did an emergency ultrasound .. that was my first ultrasound, and seeing my baby. And ever since that I wanted to keep  it. After 5 days in the hospital I signed myself out, a few weeks later I was at my boyfriend's house and it was about 1 a.m., his mom called us upstairs and asked us to help her look for something. About one minute later she turns around and screams at me asking me when I was going to tell her that I was pregnant. (She found out because my drunk cousin was flirting with her and she denied him so he got pissed and told her)  She then continued screaming at me and my boyfriend saying that we would be terrible parents because we couldn't take care of ourselves, and she said how are we going to take care of a baby if we can take care of ourselves, she said the baby would probably be dead within 2 days. (Me and my bf have depression and anxiety really bad, and a history of suicidal thoughts and attempts, I also have a history of selfharm, but as of right now I'm  over 6 months clean) After she calm down, me and my boyfriend went to his brother's room because his brother and his brother's girlfriend had heard the whole thing and was talking to us about it. I was pacing around the room crying and I looked at his brother's girlfriend and my boyfriend and said it was my fault because I believed it was, I ran outside crying and my boyfriend right after me, I ran to him and cried into his chest and kept saying how it was my fault. He was saying that it wasn't an calmed me down while hugging me. We went back down to his room for a couple of hours, little bit later as mom called us back upstairs and said she wanted to talk to us. She started yelling at us again, and I lost my temper, (bc she called my bf retarded and stupid) me and her started screaming at each other. We were screaming at each other and getting closer to eachother until we were in each others faces and then she just grabbed my arms and i was trying to get her away from me and she screamed \"get the fuck out of my house im calling the cops\". I stormed out of the house knocking over a chair out of anger as i left and started sobbing, i left without my shoes or purse or any of my stuff and called mom and told her what happened and her and her friend came and got me. I left without my shoes or purse or any of my stuff... And when I left my boyfriend was begging me to come back because he was worried i might do something bad.. But i was too scared and stayed hidden where i was.. then I called mom and told her what happened and her and her friend came and got me. It was about 3 a.m. at this point, she called her friend and they came and got me, I wasn't allowed to go back over to my boyfriend's house for a while, eventually I did just end up going over there one day a little bit later. Me my boyfriend's mom and my boyfriend all sat down and had a talk. Basically what happened is my boyfriend's mom talked me and him into getting an abortion .. I hated it, I still hate myself for it I think about it everyday. At the abortion clinic, my mom went with me my boyfriend's mom was there and so is my boyfriend. No one wanted to be there. My boyfriend couldn't even get himself to go into the building for the first 30 minutes, he came in to check on me cuz we were there for about 7 hours. We both cried. But we don't talk about it, he gets really sad if someone even mentions something similar or something that makes him think of it. I've been thinking about it a lot lately. And I really really hate myself, only a few people know that it was an abortion. We're telling everyone else it was a miscarriage, but to me it really does feel like a miscarriage. I feel so empty like I've lost something, like I've lost a piece of me. I want my baby back. I really do.. Because of this another horrible series of events was set into place. There was so much drama and lies.. The day after I got the abortion, I went to one of my \"friend's\" (she is not my fucking friend anymore) house, and she wanted me to stay the night. Well, she got out a bunch of alcohol and I ended up getting blackout drunk. (bc i was really upset obviously) But I do remember quite a lot of it. When I woke up the next morning I apologized because I was very embarrassed. When I was drunk I remember I even called my dad and talk to him on the phone for an hour. He knew I was drunk and he comforted me. Anyway a little bit later in the next day she asked me if I wanted to get drunk again, and I said sure. She said I can invite my boyfriend over if I wanted him to join us, so I did. (she'd never met or talked to him before) I'm going to take out people's names and just put letter's instead.\nMy bf: E\nMy friend: L\n~\nI spent two nights in a row at L's house. The first night.. I got black out drunk.. I don't remember much but I woke up with bruises on me and it hurt like hell to move my arm, also I had drunk texted E and a bunch of other people for hours and I could barely read them. Anyway, the next day L asked me if I wanted to get drunk again and I said sure. She told me that I could invite E over to join us if I wanted, so I did. He got there at about 6pm and he brought his PS4. Also, L would NOT shup up about how mucb she wanted some dick and I remember her saying \"I will literally try to fuck anything in sight.\" ((this was before we all started drinking)), and she was texting like 20 guys including one of E's friends. Then we got out the Vodka and started drinking. L had 2 shots, E had like 1. I had 8. When I was first starting to get tipsy i remember L kept telling be to take my shirt of and E tried to also. When I said no she got up and tried to take it off of me, I could barely hold my shot glass even. E got her to leave me alone and he said we should go and sit in the living room, I tried to move but all I did was fall over and the chair went down with me and I landed hard on my back, hitting my head. I laughed but E was suddenly standing over me helping me up and asking if I was okay. I tried standing up again but I couldn't. I can't remember very well, but I think I tried crawling to the living room. Then I blacked out. I can remember bits and pieces of things that happened.. But when I woke up the next morning, E was asleep outside and I think L was in her room. I was still very drunk, but not blackout. I pretty much stumbled outside and got E to come inside and he fell back asleep on the chair.. A little bit later L came downstairs and I was asking her what happened.. She told me that after we went into the living room E and I fucked in the middle of the living room floor right in front of her, she said I tried to pee on him afterwards and then says I passed out and peed all over the floor..((E confirmed this to me later)) I don't remember any of it except some flashes here and there. I also remember that the second night, L invited 4 guys and a girl and the were all walking around naked and shit. Then she went upstairs with them and they had a freakin orgy. E stayed downstairs with me and then him and I went in the hot tub. I remember we also did fucked in there.. Next thing I remember E was helping me get to the bathroom to dry off and put my clothes on. Then I remember he left the bathroom because the other girl needed to pee. I was sitting on the  floor in there in only my underwear and jeans trying to figure out how to put on my bra and just talking to her. I asked her to get E to help me after she was done, and he came back to help me.. I dont even remember what any of the people looked like. That's how fucked up I was. Well, anyway after she told my all the embarrassing af stuff I did when I was blacked out, I got a text message. I was still veryyy drunk mind you, but not blackout. And when I got a notification I said (very loudly) \"SoMeOnE sEnT mE a T--\" and she quietly shushed me before I could finish my sentence. I opened it, and it was a message from her through Facebook Messenger. [[It actually upset me very much having to go back and look through these]], ((((I'll copy &amp; paste the exact text here)))): \"He took advantage of me while I was drunk. I didn\u2019t want to I really didn\u2019t...and he kept asking me stuff and I just didn\u2019t know what to say I just kept saying idk I don\u2019t think we should and he did it anyway. I was fucked up and I didn\u2019t know what to do\"  I texted back, \"E did that?\" ((my texts were very misspelled obviously but she knew what I was saying)) She sent back \"Yeah...\". I was very confused and believed her right away and texted back \"What the hell. Did he rape you, is that what you're saying?\", she sent back \"Idk.... I really don\u2019t want to talk about it..it makes me uncomfortable\". At this point my drunk ass got up, went outside and started sobbing. I texted her asking what happened she replied \"He kept coming on to me and I was like aware of stuff but I was still really fucked up..he told me it would be fine and just.. I kept telling him I didn\u2019t know and that we shouldn\u2019t. But..\". I went back inside and texted her that I was gonna wake him up. She told me not to, but I said no. She said \"Fine, but let me leave first\". Well, anyway. I woke him up and I dragged him outside (bc L was still there but i thought she had left so that's why i woke him). Well, I started yelling at him I said \"Did you fuck L??\" and I think he was really confused. He said \"I don't know. What?\" and i read to him what she had said to me, and i just looked at him and started hitting him and pushing him. I stopped and was shaking and crying I looked right at him amd said \"Did you rape my friend?\" he looked extremely confused and said no. I dragged him back inside and screamed at him so much that I nearly lost my voice. I called him awful things and said awful things. I asked him again if he fucked her and he yelled back \"no, and if I did it would have been with your permission\" and I said that I didnt give my permission and he says that I did but he didnt fuck her. I yelled back \"Why would I give my permission? And even if I did I was DRUNK, you KNOW that I wouldn't want you fucking anyone else!!\". And a lot of other stuff was said.. I figured out what happened about a week or so later. She lied. Has lied about things like this before. I went to my boyfriend's house a few days after that, when I first got there he saw the look on my face and asked if I was okay. I told him no, \"No?? He asked, looking very worried, and just hugged him, I asked if we could go sit down and he said yeah, and I just hugged him more. I couldn't even get myself to look at his face. But I was crying and just said \"I'm sorry I didn't believe you.\" and he just hugged me tighter and told me that it was okay. About two days after that L sent me a message on Snapchat that said \"It was real. Can't help what happened.\" so.. Me being pissed I sent back.. \"Well. I actually don't believe you. For a MULTITUDE of reasons. Yeah, I believed you when you first told me because I was drunk off my ass and couldn't think properly. Hell, I even tried beating the shit out of him in your living room. But, I've thought about EVERYTHING that happened that night and what I've been told. I remember you trying to get us both to fuck you. And him and I wouldn't. And you called me a pussy for it. You would NOT shut up about how much you \"wanted some dick\" and was literally texting like 15 or however many guys including E's friend. I remember you walking around saying shit like \"I'm sooo drunk n' fucked up.\" You were walking around just fine. People who say they're \"super drunk\" typically are not that drunk at all.  Also, I know the kind of person my boyfriend is. He'd NEVER do that. And if he did, I know for a goddamn FACT that he'd tell me. The guilt would eat him alive. And another thing, this supposedly happened while I was passed out, correct? Why would he take advantage of YOU when I was RIGHT THERE fucking unconscious and wouldn't have been able to stop him?? I know he'd NEVER cheat. I also know that you've accused other people of doing the same when they never did.  And I haven't forgotten that you've wanted me to dump him for almost a MONTH. Tbh, you're probably pissed cuz we fucked on the floor in front of you. I'm done talking about this.\" I could have been meaner. That was me trying to be nice, but the more I typed the more pissed I got. I blocked her after I sent the message.. I don't like blocking people at all.. But I did.. I feel better and am thinking about not as much. But I still think about it sometimes, it really upsets me when I do.. But it's over now. That's the end of my story. I'm sorry it was so long. I know that I left a lot out, but I actually know for sure about everything including how I know why my boyfriend wouldn't cheat and how I know why he would feel so guilty, and I also know why I shouldn't trust my quote \"friend\" she bullied me for the better part of my life when she found out I was pregnant. Sorry if y'all are annoyed by how long this is.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I did a lot of cuts on one of my arms and it made me feel good and I know I shouldn't have done it and kept making quite a few cuts. I sometime have some dissociative episodes and it was kind of like that I was like curiously watching myself.\n\nI don't know but my feelings came back when I was done and I felt good good enough to laugh and go and eat(I haven't been eating much a nibble here and there like once a day). It felt good and I knew I shouldn't have done it though but after eating and talking to some friends through text(I did tell them that I did something that I shouldn't have done but I didn't specify). But after that I ended up cutting my other arm with less but longer cuts (the cuts are pretty shallow).\n\nAnd today I ended up going to the bathroom and cutting before my class started. And I ended up cutting again later today (I also did extra stuff to make it sting more). And then again I did a couple more cuts in a different area. I'm most likely going to do it again everything is so stressful and I have a lot of problems and anxiety. I don't have good coping skills since the majority of my life has been spent suppressing the bulk of my emotions (I'd still feel them but at a very lesser extent).

I always used to know that I was quite a bit on the sad side and didn't care about being alive, but it's only recently been confirmed to me by a professional that I do have severe depression. This actually hit quite hard, I guess just hearing others say it just made it more real? Anyways, I used to SH when I was younger (Maybe 13-14). But I eventually gave up because it really didn't feel like it was doing anything for me. \n\nHowever, recently I decided to try it out again. It actually seemed to help a bit, mostly taking my mind off of the things that made me feel horrible about life. Now, the reason I decided to start was more rash, I was just in a really dark place emotionally that day and I started to mark my arm up with a nearby tac. I got a little carried away on day one and before I knew it my right arm was covered from wrist to shoulder in scars. I quickly realized how big of a problem this was going to be when it came to hiding. I ended up having to go to school the very next day, and as you can imagine, my arm was on fire for pretty much all of it.\n\nI managed to hide it from the more \"generally populous\" by wearing a baggy hoodie. However, at lunch my friends found my arm jittering a little too noticeable and one told me to lift up my sleeves. (They had known I was going to therapy.) At this point I was pretty much forced to tell them, or they just came up with it on their own. While I wasn't comfortable showing them, I was willing to tell them that I was, but not willing to explain why.\n\nEach of my friends had their own reaction to it, all of which were definitely not what I was hoping for, I guess? I have a friend group of about four people that I regularly hang out with, and they each had the worse possible reactions to it. One friend told me that \"I was a fucking idiot for doing it...\" and just generally shame. The second reaction I got was shockingly actual laughter. He seemed to find it funny that I was doing it? I really have no idea why, but now he makes nonstop fun of it and tries to point it out whenever I'm in a room with him. The third reaction was from the only girl in our group who seems to blame me for not thinking of others. She's mad about it, but treats it more like it's my fault because I don't care about how other people would feel about it? That one confuses me the most I guess. Of course the last real reaction I got from one of the guys I'm closer with just thinks I'm trying to get attention out of it. That one I excepted the most.\n\nAnyways, I'm now pretty worried about telling my therapist. I'm not so much worried about her reaction then I am my parents, because I know she's basically forced to tell them if I come out to her. I just don't know how to go about it I guess, I'm wondering if maybe I shouldn't say anything at all? Seeing the worse possible reactions all at once from a friend group really hurt I guess. The weird thing is that I don't feel exactly self-conscious about my cuts, if I could have it my way, I'd totally wear short sleeves because I think they're more comfortable and I don't own many long sleeves. In a perfect world I'd really like if nobody brought them up at all, but that's not the world I live in.

For the scars and wounds on my wrist I mostly say that I accidentally scratch me to a wall or a door or so (this always works for me), but what can I say for my thighs? Because it ain't gonna sound realistic if I say it was a cat or accidentally scratch myself, so...\nBy the way the cuts on my thighs are not so small so the chance that no one is going to notice is small.

The urge never goes away", "author": "sleeeappplying", "self_text": "Venting here, this is my first post. I\u2019m turning 21 in a few days, I started self harming in the form of cutting when I was around 11 which turned into a full blown addiction within about a year or so. I did it every day if not multiple times a day and it never felt satisfying. I didn\u2019t learn it from anyone or any show or whatever like I see a lot of people saying about self harming. I never did it to cope with how people treated me, not that it wouldn\u2019t have been justified. I have CPTSD from a life with a narcissistic mother and an equally as emotionally abusive father. The only reason I ever cut myself is because of my terrifying realization that I started to become numb to myself and I couldn\u2019t feel emotionally anymore, or physically. I mutilated my arms and legs usually with a sedated knife because it made me feel the most but not enough. I would go back every day and do it over healing scars and fresh wounds and alternate between body parts in hopes that one time it would make me snap out of this daze I was in. That one time I would just feel it. I never did, and my dissociation has been progressing over the past 10 years now and every day I wake up it\u2019s worse. I live with it full time but am numb to even that feeling most of the time, anti feeling feeling. But when I realize how nothing in this world feels familiar to me and I know nobody and I have nothing inside my empty body cavity it makes me feverishly want to self harm again. To which I have  conflicting feelings over. I stopped harming around age 16 or 17, to then relapse again at age 18 or 19 I don\u2019t know time is fuzzy. But between those years I didn\u2019t self harm I didn\u2019t even feel it, I didn\u2019t have urges, I didn\u2019t need it. It just shut off like a light switch. Then one day out of nowhere I needed to do it so I did and that was the last time until tonight where I can\u2019t seem to get the thought out of my head. I think about it from time to time but when I do feel it I feel it very hard and I can\u2019t get it out of my head, the only thing stopping me is that I can\u2019t get my hands on a serrated knife right now, I\u2019m not a kid who can cover scars anymore, and my preferred arm is covered in tattoos to cover my healed scars. I could on my leg but it isn\u2019t the same. Which is where I relapsed last time. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m even going with this. I know I can\u2019t do it but I want to I know it won\u2019t help but I want to, I know it won\u2019t make me feel more like I own this body but I want to. I know I\u2019ll regret it when I have more scars to hide but I want to. But I would do anything to try to get rid of this feeling. It\u2019s also going to be my birthday in a few days like I mentioned and i always struggle more this time of year but I\u2019m going out with my boyfriend and we\u2019re getting a hotel for the night I don\u2019t want him to accidentally see anything when we\u2019re out to dinner or when we\u2019re having sex. He would feel so guilty and disappointed for so many reasons I don\u2019t want to do that to him again. I\u2019d love to have people share their experiences with dissociation and self harm. I don\u2019t hear much about it. I more hear about emotional driven self harm not like \u201cI can\u2019t control this foreign body that\u2019s connected under my neck and if I cut myself maybe I\u2019ll feel real pain real emotion real anything.\u201d I haven\u2019t had too many other perspectives like that. Also if you have any advice that\u2019s welcomed too. Like I said more of a rant, but if anyone feels the same, so do I.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

That was one of the worst times I\u2019ve ever done it. I don\u2019t remember what news I got but whatever it was, made me cut myself like I never have before. That was the last time I ever self harmed. The reason I stopped was because after that I sat in the bathroom for a good 45 mins &amp; looked down at my wrist &amp; my legs &amp; all I could think about was \u201c what have I done to myself \u201c I knew I couldn\u2019t do this any longer. I felt really bad for myself. How could I let it get this far? I had to help myself since no one else was. I started from cutting myself twice a day, to a couple times a week &amp; then finally I stopped. It was a really hard journey for me,  since I had no one by side, nor anyone to talk too about it, but I picked myself up &amp; promised myself I would NEVER go down that dark path ever again &amp; I\u2019ve never looked back since! I wish I could just erase all my scars honestly but it\u2019s a reminder to me of a battle, that eventually I won.  It\u2019s crazy to think about it now because I\u2019m 22 &amp; even when someone mentions razor blades or any sharp object I kind of cringe, or want to look away because I would never do that now. Even if I get a tiny paper cut I\u2019m a big crybaby lol. It\u2019s amazing how far I\u2019ve become. If you or anyone you know is self harming or is thinking about it. Please get some help there is so many resources out there. &amp; I\u2019m also here if anyone wants to talk.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

{"post_id": "dhaxse", "created_utc": 1570975268, "title": "Judgemental to fine to not", "author": "Neoprenejoe", "self_text": "I never understood cutting. I wouldn't say I thought it was for attention, but I did think it was a certain type of GIRL who did it. I would never become that type of girl, right? Well, I didn't but I did start cutting. And I have a male friend who did. And two female friends. I realized how fucked up my thoughts were and I am still so sorry. And one started when she was in 4th grade. Stupid fucking me would roll my eyes and stare when her scars peaked through. I feel like such a piece of shit now!\n\n It wasn't until 6th grade I sort of understood, and 9th grade when I really did. Thats when I started. My life just fell apart so fast! I held on for a year (everything started in 8th grade) and I legitametly believed I was fine, but I wasn't. \n\nEventually, I just fell apart infront of my favorite teacher, Mr M (Band teacher) because I fucked up the ending of a song in a festival. I was crying and shaking and all the pain and betrayal of the past year came pouring out like never before and I was so embarassed but I couldn't stop.\n\n He got so concerned and at the time I couldn't understand this, but I now know that he was seriously concerned and didn't want to leave me, but he really did have to go so he offered to send out a chaperone. I said no, absolutely not, leave me alone. He agreed on the condition that I stayed in that same spot without leaving. He said if I wasn't back in 5 minutes, I had no choice and he was sending a chaperone out. I was back in 3 minutes and life carried on.\n\n When we got back home from the festival a few days later, I found out by the councellor that he contacted her. She convinced me not to be mad at him, but she didn't convince me to open up. I told myself I wouldn't ask the teacher about it, as I really thought he was legitamelty concerned, but hey, I also told myself I wouldn't cut, which I did about 3 days later. \n\nI really wasn't ok. And I did confront Mr. M about the whole councellor thing. He basically just said that he was concerned about me, and would not apologize for it. (I wanted him to) I insisted that I was fine as he said he was worried that I wasn't and that he's seen how I went from happy to \"happy\" and it \"worried him\" because he \"cared\" about me. Sure, I tirelessly insisted I was fine, meanwhile my arm had maybe about 50 cuts at that time. \n\nMy cutting got worse and worse, and so did I. Fast forward a long way, and I thought I was free from the chains I casted upon myself (SH) and I promised myself that I would never judge, like I had in the past. My body was ruined, but I wasn't about to make it any worse. For 3 months. And I wasn't even clean for that long, but I certainly believed that stabbing myself with sewing needles didn't count. \n\nHowever, things got bad again and I relapsed, majorly so. I can't stop. I want to right now so bad, but I can't. I even first cut (since 3 months) on my BD and called it a birthday gift to myself. One I actually deserved. Now, I have to wait 4 hours until morning until I can cut again, (long story) but I can hang myself with a belt and goddamit I'm thinking about it. \n\nNo one would miss me, people would infact be happy. The ironic thing, I made a post a few days ago about how I cut so I can live, but I can't cut right now when I really need to soooo... \n\nBesides, when I made that post, I thought my life was worth it, but I realize now that my life ain't shit. I don't deserve life and I am a disgrace on this planet. Nobody deserves to so much as lay an eye upon someone like me, and I can make sure no one ever does. People would for once, for the first time ever be happy about something I've done.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

It wasn't meant to be a suicide attempt but it looked like one. It burst with blood all over my apertment, two pools as I staggered around for something to hold against it as I panicked and called 911.\n\nI was faint and pale by the time I was in the ambulance. I was in emerge for 12 hours.\n\nMy phone died 3 hours into the initial ER visit. I was in a Er room at the end of the hall with little foot traffic. I was alone. I was scared. Blood started to leak up my IV and I had one of many panic attacks. One time I called for the nurse and no one came. I cried. A woman with her mother saw me and fetched a nurse to get help. My heart rate was tachycardic the whole stay because of anxiety and fear. \n\n After getting stitched and IVs and heart monitoring I was placed involentarily into a psyc ward for 2.5 days. No cellphone or nintendo, obviously... But the place didn't even have a bookshelf, just an empty hall and ONE SINGLE coloring book and crayons between 20 unstable mental patients. My nurses were kind but I heard them act cruel towards the less mentally sound patients. It was as hot as a sauna and the beds were covered in gritty plastic. I couldnt shower without supervision.\n\nI couldnt call my parents or my boyfriend or friends because the numbers were all long distance, even though the ward had a communal phone. (Im in my current city for college.) I had to wait for them to call. Sometime other patients would pick up the phone then hang up if it wasn't for them. I could only get visitors a total of 4 hours a day. My parents weren't there the first day until late. They brought me a tamagotchi and it was my only solstice. Now I love tamagotchi.\n\n\nI didn't want to die that night, but if that exact same cut had been on my arm, I would have. I was isolated, scared, depressed. I was faint and dizzy. I was tired for the whole ward stay. I had nothing to do, my brain melted into mush. All I did was sleep. I was more depressed in the ward, but had to act as peachy as possible to get released on time. \n\nNothing in my life has wanted to make me stop cutting so much until this. I'm going to try my damndest to never slice an inch again. I never want to go back to that ward. I never want to feel so helpless.\n\nI just wanted to get this off my chest, sorry there's no really coherent message.

I lit a match, blew it out cuz I was too scared to put the entire flame out on myself and then I put the match head on my arm before the embers went out. I first only touched my arm briefly and reflexively pulled my arm away but the second time I pushed it down on my arm and held it there. Not to sound, I don't know, alarming but the pain was good. Really good. I tried keeping it there until I didn't feel the pain anymore but I wasn't able to which still really upsets me. I don't know how long I held it there but when I pulled it away I had an indent the size and shape of the match head on my arm, it looked almost like my skin had melted. The pain wasn't excruciating tho, like at all. I then went on to hurt myself in other ways but no more burning.\n\n After I finished my self harm binge so to speak, about forty minutes later maybe or longer I took a shower and then had to go out. I put on a long sleeve sweater and forgot about it completely for the next four hours. I never felt the sleeve rubbing up against it or anything the whole time. Once I got home it had blistered and I accidently popped it and my impulsive self destructiveness made me feel like I had to get rid of the skin that had been the blister. So I peeled that off of it and that didn't even really hurt either. Once I finished doing that I had a bright white spot there and it still didn't hurt. \n\n That was at like midnight on Thursday. It's now noon on Sunday and it looks sort of like a crater on my arm. The edge of it is like a thin brown line and the burn sort of has a tan tinge on it and the center of it is whiter than the rest and you can see small thin red tendrils in the center, it looks like really small veins but I know they aren't cuz that wouldn't make sense. It still doesn't hurt. The most pain I get from it , both the first and second burn I gave myself, is just the sort of dull pain you get if you push down on a scab or something if I push down on them. \n\n I know third degree burns don't usually cause pain because they kill the nerves and stuff but I don't know how a not even still lit match could give me a third degree burn, especially since both of the burns don't hurt, and one of those burns was from less than a second of a contact with the match. It would make more sense for the second burn to be third degree I guess even though that still sounds unlikely but for both of them to be just doesn't make sense to me.

Things like molestation, childhood abuse, neglect and TRAUMA are the real gateways. These things manifest into addiction, hyper sexuality, violent tendencies, self harm etc. All of these things are the SYMPTOMS not the cause of a much larger issue. All of these manifestations stem from some sort of emotional trauma or childhood abuse. This is why traditional 30 day rehabs and medications don't typically work. We need to get to the root cause of the trauma that leads so many to look outside of themselves for relief from SELF.\n\nAddiction is manifested in any behavior that brings temporary relief or pleasure yet causes negative consequences. This behavior is then difficulty to give up. We need to realize that addiction is not a CHOICE, addiction is not an inherited disease. Addiction is a physiological and psychological response to a painful life experience. \n\nI think so many can agree, if able to put their egos aside, that many people have dealt with some sort of traumatic experience. Maybe not as extreme as something like sexual assault, but maybe growing up in a toxic household around parents who yelled and were always stressed or even depressed. Trauma doesnt have to be so significant it can be anything that our bodies/minds (especially when children) cannot comprehend or process. These past experiences subconsciously manifest in creating barriers or walls to protect ourselves. When we become adults they really reek havoc and manifest in all types of issues as noted above. I'm sure many of us can also agree we have at one time or another had some sort of addiction behavior whether it be, overworking, shopping, unhealthy/over eating, gambling, sex, drama, codependent relationships, etc.. We need to come together and stop judging one another. We need to stop bandaging our issues and get to the root cause, the root trauma and reach out for help when needed. This is a sign of strength not weakness. Trauma can also store in our physical bodies which can also manifest into sickness and disease, making us more at risk for cancers and things like autoimmune disease.\n\nTRAUMA is the real gateway.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

You know, the kid of freaks out when they get a 90% and seems to think school is the most important thing on earth. Well, goddammit, I have issues too. I know it seems like I'm complaining about nothing when I get that 90%, but do you know how much of failure I feel like when I get that grade? Literally all I'm good at is school, and if I can't do that well then I don't know what the fuck my purpose is. And you know what the best part is? I'm not even that fucking smart. I'm a fucking idiot. I'm just so afraid of being seen as a disappointment that I can't not put 110% effort in.

I hate myself and I don't think I'm ever actually going to get better. My life is just a big series of ups, where I think I can do anything and accomplish any unrealistic goal that I set for myself, and downs, where I think I'm the most worthless person on earth.

and meticulous self harm planning which will sometimes turn into random random disturbing shit and suicidal scenarios. i\u2019ve envisioned myself jumping out my bedroom window onto that concrete patio in the backyard for probably 8 months. and i\u2019ve now graduated to lying and buying utility knife sand box cutters with my mom\u2019s credit card at cvs. \n\nso. another thing that will happen is my perspective. it will just completely diminish and i\u2019ll have this strange, foreign, flat affect and will be in complete silence and lie around for hours. i won\u2019t even cry or anything. i can\u2019t stand any sort of noise, or music. god i can\u2019t even put it in words. and when it\u2019s over i act like my typical self i guess. talkative. don\u2019t really care about stuff but it\u2019s fine. i\u2019ll engage in my hobbies and giggle and shit. \n\nanyways. that\u2019s what\u2019s been happening. i went on an antidepressant two weeks ago that put me in absolute agony and made me sick for about 6 days straight. intensified this dissociative state massively. it hadn\u2019t ever been that bad. and i\u2019ve been lying to my parents telling them that i\u2019ve been taking the new one because i refuse to put myself through that again. and part of me just hated how it completely deadened all my emotions and made me miss feeling depressed again. and wanting to be in that familiar comfortable state again, and just wallow in it forever. and just fall asleep to music that suits the mood. on cloudy/rainy fall days in my bedroom and stuff like that. that\u2019s what i wanted and it\u2019s not what i got. i absolutely fucked myself is what i did and i feel insane. i haven\u2019t been sleeping. \n\nit\u2019s currently 12:40 right now and i don\u2019t care. i don\u2019t care and i\u2019m taking the percocet. im too tired and i can\u2019t go to school in the morning and i\u2019d rather just lacerate myself completely instead of commiting suicide now that i feel like i have some sort of grasp on myself so that i can stay in inpatient and not end up hurting myself on another random impulse, that only seems to be getting worse. i have no legitimate reason to go at all and i doubt anyone\u2019s gonna take me. so i\u2019ll just call an ambulance after i do it and stay at the hospital for a few hours until my parents find out hopefully after they leave for work (thinking that i\u2019ve already left for school) yesterday i thought about it and just didn\u2019t want to go at all. i just wanted to die. i didn\u2019t want to self harm, i just wanted to die. and the scariest part was that i didn\u2019t care and there suddenly wasn\u2019t any contradicting thought forcing me to dismiss it. i was just so tired and didn\u2019t feel like thinking about anything at all. i didn\u2019t have the energy nor the desire to. and it felt like that\u2019s all it\u2019s ever felt like. it wasn\u2019t going to be any different and i didn\u2019t want it to be?? this probably makes absolutely no sense and it\u2019s all so fucked up. \n\ni bought this extremely sharp utility knife (so sharp that just grazing myself with it made me bleed all over my hands) to cut myself with. i really really really tried last week and i couldn\u2019t make myself do it. i whimped out probably six fucking times in my school bathroom and twice in my bathtub. and just felt sick to my stomach because i couldn\u2019t do it. and it made my heart race so fucking much it was unbelievable. \n\nanyway. i wanted the percocet so that i\u2019d feel more relaxed and so the pain would be easier to deal with, and so i wouldn\u2019t back out. i can\u2019t go to school anymore. and no one cares. so i feel the need to legitimize myself, so that i fit the criteria so that i can actually get better. idk. \n\ni plan on leaving around 3am. everyone will be asleep hopefully. i\u2019m gonna take the pill and wander outside until i start to feel dizzy and distracted hopefully. and then i\u2019m gonna sit on the bench and do it. redo it even so that i\u2019ll get it right. exactly as i envisioned it. and press down with gauze for fifteen minutes. and then cut further down if it seeps through. oh fuck. idk if i\u2019ll actually do that. i don\u2019t honestly think i could even tolerate that. whatever. \n\ni was so fucking unclear in that previous post. i purposefully only took one about six months ago and decided to wait until they would be completely gone and i wouldn\u2019t be tempted to take more of them. and because i had been such a fucking pussy about it before and was too reluctant to do it. just how i too reluctant to cut/stab myself on friday. jesus i sound so aggressive. this is exactly what i was talking about. it\u2019s like i want to hurt myself and i keep envisioning this figure holding me down and lacerating me with that blade. and i\u2019m just watching myself resist from a third point of view. \n\nanyway. the point isn\u2019t to even get high anymore. i don\u2019t remember why i stole it before. it was probably because i thought it\u2019d make me feel better or something. my parents don\u2019t drink alcohol so they don\u2019t end up like addicts like my other relatives (hardcore ones). so this is probably gonna be one of the most stupid things i\u2019ve ever done in my entire life and i don\u2019t give a flying fuck. i don\u2019t even know why i\u2019m posting this. and i highly doubt anyone\u2019s gonna even read it. \n\nI\u2019m currently failing all my classes, and am probably gonna end up dropping precalculus and all my ap\u2019s (again). and i live in such a conservative fucking state where people think mental illness is some kind of bullshit excuse, i\u2019m probably not gonna be accommodated, they\u2019re probably gonna deny my request to do online school 2 months late into the year (as i\u2019d be such a major inconvenience to them) especially since a letter from a fucking psychiatrist isn\u2019t gonna satisfy them. but maybe a hospital stay would. able to drop any of them, reset my failing grades and be able to pass the rest of the year at this point, not have \u201cwithdrew failing\u201d on my transcript for junior year without a good enough reason. and this would be it. i\u2019m scared. i don\u2019t want to do it. and i don\u2019t know how to make myself do it. i\u2019m so exhausted and if i fall asleep i probably won\u2019t wanna get up. everything\u2019s all so screwed up.\n\npeople in the other post were talking about how i\u2019m the lowest kind of thief there is and how i\u2019ve been making so many self justifications for myself and how i\u2019m gonna regret everything they\u2019re probably right. i hate myself. and i actually feel like crying so i guess that\u2019s better than numb blunted fucking emotions. \n\nAND JESUS. this is so humiliating. i\u2019ve said nothing constructive except bitch and moan and ramble nonsense about my issues that have nothing to do with this subreddit. whatever. i have two hours to lay here and cry about it and maybe feel better afterwards, and not be so anxious.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Once I'd finished I tucked my lighter back into my pocket, sat there for a bit and after 20 seconds or so I started to slam my fist into my leg repeatedly out of frustration and he properly sat up, once i stopped he continued to give me this really sad look, I was sitting there for a few more minutes but he kept looking at me instead of going back to sleep, which isn't something he ever does.

I've tried to quit multiple times over the years and the longest I've been clean for at a time is about 6 months. this year after there was an incident involving my grandfather, I've completely spiralled mental health wise, and I seem to be having major manic episodes and major depressive episodes.

I can't stop and it's the only thing that brings me calm, except for smoking weed which I have none of because I'm too unmotivated to hand my resume out and get a job. my boyfriend is really worried for me and it often happens when we have arguments. he struggles with anger issues and suppresses his feelings so it does escalate our arguments but they sort out, but it has really gotten to the point where I can't stop hurting myself when I get like that, no matter if he's watching or not. he often has to physically restrain me so I stop and at that point, I just feel weak and out of control and a bit crazy. it's so humiliating and I feel like a horrible person for putting him through all this.

Our relationship today is great, but when I was young he was a very volatile person. On some days he was great, but on others he would explode at the drop of a hat. We were spanked as children, but not to any extreme we can remember. Punishments always sucked, but it was the enraged, furious yelling and screaming from my father that hurt the most. I still have vague memories to this day, of him berating us for misbehaving. Of course there are several instances I recall where he was especially vicious.\n\nSometime around 2000, I saw an opportunity to express how much he was hurting me. Much to his credit, he made a dedicated effort to change himself, but by that point it was too late. The damage had been done, and the seeds of self loathing were sown. \n\nAlmost a decade ago, we moved into an apartment complex, and he was having a bad day. He wasn't angry at me, just angry in general and yelling about it. Somehow I managed to hide it, but I was in tears as he did whatever he could to get something done. A few weeks later he made a sarcastic comment about me washing the dishes, and it started a phase that lasted for years. While he was sleeping, I looked myself in the mirror, and it was like someone played a tape recording of a voice in my head telling me that I was a shit son, and that my father would be happier and better off without me.\n\nEventually I learned how to silence that voice with another, but it evolved.\n\nI don't hear that voice anymore, but I'm completely convinced that I have no worth, and that I deserved all the abuse I got as a kid. A hurtful fantasy I have, is being presented with something that would end my life at the benefit of saving someone else's. That it would be, \"For the best. My life would never have had much value otherwise.\" Of course I know that something like that will never come. Life isn't an anime. For added pain, I also throw some of his words back at him before offing myself. A petty revenge so that he'd be haunted by his words as much as I am, but it kills me to think of hurting him like that.\n\nMy Dad has apologized so many times for not being there when I needed him, has SHOWN how much he loves me, tells me he loves me almost every time I talk to him over the phone, but it still doesn't scratch the surface. \n\nI still hate myself, and see absolutely no value in my life.

Also...sorry if this doesn't belong here. I kind of turned it into a storytelling rant.\n\nOne memory in particular stands out to me. I remember being in the cafeteria for lunch in middle school. As I was leaving I looked over at a table and saw a group of kids sharing a couple razors and leaving marks on their arms. I didn't understand how someone could intentionally do something like that to themself. Oh, how much that poor boy's mind has changed.\n\nStarting in middle school I had a little self hatred and whatnot, but never did any actions. Unfortunately, as a freshman in highschool I found some razor blades while digging through a cabinet, and curiosity got the best of me. I wish I never found those blades. I would only use a blade once or twice, tiny cuts, then throw it away in regret. After off-and-on slight usage during the winter months, in my sophomore year I made a cut on my forearm that was deep enough to leave an inch long scar, thankfully not too visible. I decided to stop and try to put SH behind me.\n\nBut as time passed I would feel the urge to hurt myself more and more often. Originally I started just punching my thighs, sometimes bruising them to the point where I couldn't even walk or had a heavy limp. But I wanted to draw blood. Regretting the scar on my arm, I moved to cutting my thighs; after punching them so much in the past it wasn't as painful anymore. I'd break apart new disposable razors and use the blades. Threw them away in regret. Moved to breaking and using pencil sharpener blades. Threw them away too and bounced back to breaking razors. This happened throughout highschool, and now I've got a couple dozen scars on my thighs that range up to a little more than 2 inches. THANKFULLY they're not too obvious unless you know they're there.\n\nTowards the end of highschool I wanted to stop cutting, so I tried jabbing the side of my thigh with a hot lighter. Did that for a week or so, didn't like it. It's 2019, HS Graduation came, along side it my first job over the summer, paid a decent bit, but my anxiety exploded. Towards the end of summer shit happened and my first relationship ended, ohhh boy. (Only a few months, but still my first girlfriend.) With my parents' support/listening, a breakdown ensued. First about the breakup but turned into how I've felt worthless, fuck everything in life up etc. A new wave of shitty thoughts and feelings of loneliness and all sort happened.\n\nEventually I learned about using a stapler, so now I tend to staple my thighs every other or every few days. Went out and bought razor blades too, only used them once in the past month.\n\nRight now I'm in my first semester of college, and I honestly didn't think I'd make it through highschool. Hopefully I make it through college too.\n\nIf you're new to this world and considering trying self harm, DON'T. Please. I miss the innocence my middle school mind had. I fucking hate the fact that I found those blades, and that they opened me up to the world of self harm. It got me addicted. I am slowly opening up to my parents, as of now it is becoming easier talking about anxiety, but my bad thoughts are still hard to talk about. I've yet to officially be diagnosed with some sort of anxiety/depression, hopefully I will soon and I can get help. Had 1 visit w/ family doctor so far to get things started.\n\nI've been typing at this for over an hour and a half, I need to go to bed. \n\n\n((I'm typing this on my phone near midnight, been up since 5-ish, so I apologize for poor grammar or word choice or whatnot.))", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

One which you can use to track your SH and your urges and will tell you how many days it's been since you last harmed or had an urge. I also thought to include all the different types of SH there are with information on them, as well as advice for what to do when you've harmed which can also be specific depending on the type as well as your age. \n\nI thought it may also be useful to include some calming strategies and advice for when you feel like doing it. I have seen an app which has a tracker for urges which is password protected which many people didn't like, but I recognise that this is something very private for many of us so I thought of making it optional if you would like it PIN protected.\n\nI would also probably include a list of services specific to your country that you can access online, by phone or by text. Whilst these services can be found searching online, I thought it may be helpful to compile a list of support so you don't have to search online finding the right service. \n\nAs someone who SHs and has done for ~7 years I feel like this is something I personally would find useful, but I want to know what others think would or wouldn't be useful.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Maybe I'm just bad but anyway. My boyfriend   gets mad sometimes and this past couple of days I got beat up pretty good by him (  long story short we fought ) but something in me broke this time .

Right under that . But I mean if he does notice he can't get mad right? Because he cuts . I burn . We both have scars . He can't judge me for the same thing he does right ? . I don't know if I want him to care about it or not because if I know him he will maybe  be shocked and not let me keep any lighters or anything . .

She just said \u201cOh they just snag on my shirt so much and it hurts\u201d so conversationally. C was like \u201cNo seriously are you okay\u201d and L said yes.

She then blocked me on insta and unfollowed me on everything, which I\u2019m not even mad about. There\u2019s no school today or tomorrow so on Monday I\u2019m gonna try to distance myself from her again, and hopefully she won\u2019t guilt trip me again.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Although, some of my friends (NOT family) know that I\u2019m bi but I came out on the terms that I was going to kill myself. As in, I was giving a piece of myself away, was looking for rejection and a reason to hurt myself. So really I didn\u2019t come out because I was ready and had accepted myself but because I was looking for another reason to end my life which would ultimately push me over the edge.\nUnfortunately for that voice inside my head, everyone was supportive and this motivated me to hold on. It was a hard time and I had planned my suicide but a conversation I had with a friend one night which distracted me. I still wanted to die but I just cut myself instead to fill some kind of void. Ofc this friend doesn\u2019t know about my self harm. Hence, I stopped caring about anything (life) and inevitably my sexuality. In some twisted way, I had finally accepted myself after years of self-suppression.\nWhat happens when I don\u2019t want to die anymore? Will I still \u2018accept\u2019 myself? However, this seems impossible to reach a point of happiness as self-intolerance continues a cycle of self-harm, self-hatred and consuming suicidal thoughts. \nP.S. other than the people on this sub reddit, no one knows about my self harm and sorry if anything didn\u2019t make sense.\nThis post is not asking for advice, I just wanted to rant and thanks for reading", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I first started cutting myself when I was 13. This lasted for several months, eventually stopping when my mother found out and I realized how much it was affecting the people around me. The urge was always in the back of my mind, but for 5 years I was clean, and a part of me was proud. I don't know what happened, I don't know what it was that pushed me over the edge this time, but I relapsed a few days ago, and I think it's even worse than before. I don't want to hurt the people I care about by telling anybody I know in real life about this, but I'm not sure if it's safe for me to keep this to myself. Basically for the last 4 days, if I'm not at work, eating or asleep, I'm cutting my thighs, non-stop. I went to the store today and I was literally shaking because I hadn't hurt myself since last night, and if I didn't do it again today then that meant I was a faker and just trying to get attention. \n\nOn another note, this violent relapse lead to me suddenly remembering a lot of things from when I was first self harming. One of these things was that I had told a girl I was friends with at the time about what I was doing. A few days later she told me that she had started as well. I felt horrible, thinking that I had put this idea into her head, and that I was disgusting for forcing my bad habits onto others. She had showed me her 'cuts'. She has dermatographism, she would get welts if you tapped her a little too hard, and to me the 'cuts' looked like she just dragged her nail across her wrist, but whatever. Self harm is self harm, just because you don't draw blood doesn't mean you didn't hurt yourself. The thing about this that bothered me was that when we got to class, she had rolled up her sleeve and placed her arm on her desk with the welts facing straight up, not trying to hide them at all. It was such an odd experience because I hid mine like my life depended on it, but the last thing I wanted to do was bring attention to it, so I said nothing. Another story about this girl: We were at lunch with some other friends (about 7 people besides me, and only 2 people in the group knew I was self harming) when she had whispered to me that she had self harmed again. Feeling repulsively guilty I told her that she had to stop, that I wish she would have talked to me before she did it, so that I could have tried to help, or at the very least, comforted her. She then loudly shouted \"You do it too!\" She basically outed me to all of my friends, they all treated me different after that, and some of them stopped talking to me period.

I am two years clean, but reading these posts really struck a chord. I wanted to explain my story a little bit and how I was able to overcome SH. \n\nI started cutting myself at 11 years old. It was a VERY well kept secret, I kept them hidden on certain parts of my body. I practiced self harm basically every single night for about 9, almost 10, years. I really picked up self harming when my physically and emotionally abusive father passed away. I was cutting myself MULTIPLE times a day. This continued, add a few suicide attempts, and now i'm 2 years clean. \n\nBut it wasn't easy to stop, and I understand that. I know we hear the same suggestions, so I wanted to explain how I coped and how I weaned myself off this very addicting act of self destruction. \n\n* Learn and understand your triggers\n* Journal, try a rubberband, \"cut\" (hah) back on how frequently you SH\n* Pick up a distracting hobby\n* Meet new people, online or IRL. Join any type of community\n* Seek to help other people and make them feel better\n* Talk to someone. A friend, family member, your dog, a therapist/counselor\n\nIt took hitting a really big low for me to decide I needed the help. I suck out therapy when I turned 18, and it didn't help me much. I understand that picking up a new hobby while already depressed is near impossible. A few states in the US hold SMA meetings, which are self-harm anonymous groups. They are FREE and run exactly like an AA or NA meeting would work. They are where I have found most of my therapy. \n\nI had to FORCE myself to try something new. So, I turned to playing instruments and knitting. I forced myself to sit there and play the guitar for hours until my fingers bled. I picked something to keep my hands busy and my brain focused. \n\nI wrote songs, made my friends things out of yarn, and kept in regular contact with friends. A BIG thing I REALLY suggest: If you have a friend that is understanding with SH/Depression and you trust them, please please please tell them about your struggle. Text them when you're feeling low (you don't even have to say you're low, but reach out) and have a conversation. If you want, you could be honest with them and tell them how you're feeling. Keep yourself accountable but also open to help them too. \n\nPLEASE understand you are NOT alone. There are people everywhere. Online, IRL, school, old friends, family you trust, etc. I felt so alone for so many years. I still feel alone sometimes. But find some people you work well with and try to trust them. Try to see the good in others and form meaningful relationships. \n\n\\---\n\nI wasn't able to quit cold turkey. I applied these methods for a long time until I finally threw my \"stash\" away (it took me a WHILE to throw it away after I stopped SH). \n\nYou don't deserve to feel worthless or hurt. It doesn't matter what you've done or what you've gone through. You do not deserve to live this way. I felt like I deserved it. I deserved to feel pain and feel as terrible as I did. But I didn't deserve it, and you don't either. \n\nI still have urges. My best friend of 11 years died about 2 weeks ago and my urges are as high as they have ever been. But I don't deserve it. So I will go see my therapist, I will take my medications, and I will give myself the best fucking shot at life that I can. I really hope you give it your best shot too.\n\nIf anyone wants to reach out to me, feel free. I know this all seems cliche, but it saved my life and I really want all of you to feel safe too.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

So I'm not going to preach on why you should stop cutting or burning or anything like that, especially when I do it myself. But I am making this post to hopefully encourage some of you to self-harm in a healthier and/or safer way.   \nI see so many people posting about how they use a knife from home or a kitchen knife or rusty blades or blades they found somewhere. Please please stop. A kitchen knife... You use it to cut open your skin. it gets blood on it, then you put it right back for someone to cut their food with... To me, that is just a line that shouldn't be crossed. For your health and others. If that knife wasn't washed right or you don't wash it right, someone could get very sick. It is just unsanitary, if you use the knife only for self-harming (which I again do not encourage) then that is fine. Just please don't use a kitchen knife then put it back. And rusty blades... I think you guys should know why I am discouraging the use of rusty blades. But finding blades, no matter how clean- is also bad. It could get you very very sick even if you wash them because there are germs and bacteria that you cannot see and that might not come off with soap and water.   \nSo again, I'm not trying to tell you not to hurt yourself because I'm sure you all have heard it before. But I am asking that you at least be safe... ish. about it. Please wash anything you're going to use before and after using it. Please keep your 'materials' stored in a relatively clean and safe location. And please don't use anything that will have to be put back where it came from for others to use (such as a kitchen knife).", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I'm making a lot of those lately especially when I become numb or like kind of disconnected (I still feel a little bit of my anxiety in the pit of my stomach but otherwise I don't feel much considering I'm typically in a very depressive state before the numbness takes over). \n\nI never thought about self harm before, though I did and still do think about suicide. The way I've been lately being all over the place is actually kind of scary, there is a huge possibility that from my behavior in the past month that one of my next numb moments or mental break downs I'm gonna do something really bad. Like either intentionally commit suicide or end up cutting myself or doing some other kind of self harm that would end up killing me.\n\nOr that ill just be completely lost with no way to ever get better. End up being so addicted that I have to cut almost every second and have to continue going deeper and deeper. I'm so messed up. I've posted on a suicide watch on Reddit, I actually had one of my breaks recently and while I didn't end up doing my mind was so messed up in that moment really scattered and kind of dizzying and slightly blurry or kind of like in slow moiron while my vision was not focused in certain areas of my field of sight.\n\nKind of like the mind is braking or something I don't know if any of my explanation makes sense my heads really heavy and pressured feeling right now. I'm having a hard time finding reasons to resit cutting or just ending it, the only reason I haven't ended it is fear so I guess that's where the self harm comes in or something.

I'm about to go end my streak, and he proceeded to bitch about everything I do. Right after he turned off my router, my mom turns on a hotspot on her phone so I can finish and say bye to my gf.\n\n\nAnyway, he yells at my mom for helping me out, I'm like welp, fuck it. I go to 'shower', and he says to not spend more than 20 minutes in the shower. I'm like ah yes, good to see I'm a waste of money.\u00a0\n\n\nI do the yeet and then shower, people are pretty pissed cuz I yote for about 30 minutes, then showered for another 15. I get out, and my dad immediately says \"should I text your coach that you won't be at the games tomorrow?\" I play rugby, and we have a big game tommorow. I'm like no bitch. He says, \"how are you gonna get there?\" I say \"I'm sure I can get a ride from coach\" he's like \"how are you gonna let him know? Gonna figure things out or go and ask your mommy?\" He says that in the most mocking way possible. I'm like \"can you FUCK-\" and storm off cuz I'm mad as hell. He sticks his head into my room and says \"I'm trying to help and you try me like trash\" I respond, \"yeah, guess I'll hang myself BITCH!\" And he says \"look at you using all those big words\" this fucker doesn't even give a shit if I die. I cut myself up even worse, now, after a week clean, I'm covered in stryo yeets again.\n\n\nI'm pretty much ready to die now. My girlfriend is the only thing keeping me in this shit hole of a life. My noose is hung from the rafters, but I think imma cry myself to sleep now. Fuck, I hate it so much.\n\n\nTL;DR my dad's a dick and my clean streak gets raped anally.

Crossposting in r/selfharm and r/OCD\n\nSo I'm 10 years deep in this shitty recovery journey and my weapon of choice was always a blade. I'm coming up on 4 years clean December 15th. I have OCD and my harming usually took the form of an elaborate ritual of cleaning my tools, disinfecting my skin, doing the thing, then taking care of the wound carefully and with (probably too many) first aid items. Since quitting my OCD has slowly morphed into something more resembling Tourette's. Rather than planned rituals to relieve anxiety, my compulsion to relieve anxiety comes on so quick there's no time to think. Punch first, ask questions later. \n\nI've been punching my arms and legs. It's usually just once and not too hard, but it's escalating. I'll also hit my forehead against walls. It happens so fast I can't stop myself when the urge is strong. It's like if I don't do it, I'll die. I have a lot of violent intrusive thoughts about breaking my skull open on a corner. I'll also dig my fingernails into my palms for some subtle relief I can do On ThE gO.\n\nMy doctor changed my medication from Wellbutrin and Seroquel to Wellbutrin and Abilify. I'm not willing to try another SSRI after having 3 bad reactions. When I was cutting, my partner helped me by taking all my tools out of the house. Now 4 years later, we have things I could use in the house again but I don't have the urge. It's just the punching now. I can't exactly remove my hands from my environment. \n\nI don't know if this is a question or a vent or what. I want to hear other people's experiences with punching. What helps? Should I take a boxing class? Get a massage? Buy a straight jacket? Starting to feel like I'm CRAZY crazy.

I\u2019ve been having to get drunk more, and drinking more to get the same effect and if I don\u2019t drink I get other issues like hands shaking uncontrollably - my girlfriend saw my hands doing it the other day, and my friends are getting concerned about my drinking habits, but i\u2019m scared to tell them the reason behind it (in case they tell my family) Over the 3 or so weeks i\u2019ve put so much willpower behind not picking up my blades and cutting, it always releases the mental and emotional pain. Sometimes I pick up my blade and just think to myself what I want to do. I went to counselling and always denied the way I actually felt, I learned to act shocked when they asked if I wanted to commit suicide, my answer was always no, but in my head it was always yes, I never see the point in living. At this point in time I am still contemplating whether I do or don\u2019t, I just feel so weak (mentally). Another thing I have are intrusive thoughts which doesn\u2019t help, I keep seeing and thinking of my friends dying in my arms and me not being able to help them, since I started getting these thoughts i\u2019ve started carrying a first aid kit on me because it helps me feel a bit safer, but these keep happening, I can\u2019t get rid of them. The only way I can get through a day is with alcohol (enough to forget about my pain) or I really struggle, I hate the way I am. \n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not expecting anyone to read this rant but if u do thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Also the main question is at the end.\n\nJust so we are clear, I am a 16 year old male who used to self harm from about 14.5 to 15.5 (February 2018-March 2019). In fact I will be eight months clean on November 9. Also worth noting when I had severe depression at ages 10-11 (that is not a typo) I would also engage in self harm but it was more hitting my head and extremely negative thoughts (your ugly, you look different than other boys, no girl will want you, etc. but that\u2019s a different story).\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing, I have no cuts on my arms. Fortunately, my self harm never got to that point (also because I frequently go in the pool with my mom in the summer.\n\nMy method of choice was always digging my nails into my skin. If I ever got stressed out in class I would dig my nails deep into the palms of my hands in my sweatshirt pocket. This would leave noticeable gashes for an hour of so but never any scars, although I did bleed from it once.\n\nMy other methods included whipping with headphones, hitting, falling from a few feet, and negative thoughts.\n\nI sometimes feel urges but that\u2019s more rare now. I also did put a knife against my arm one night but I doubt I was actually gonna cut. At the time I had moderate depression, social anxiety (still have that), and completely tanked self esteem. In March I began to rapidly recover and was a mostly normal 15 year old boy by April. Sometimes all you need is a change of mindset.\n\nBut did you go straight to cutting or burning?

What should I do?\n\nSo far, I have resorted to screaming and lashing out. I have ranted and raved at a professor I was familiar with. I have screamed non-stop for almost an hour. I have thrown things - plushies, books, and even my suitcase. I have even said very hurtful things to my father.\n\nIt's an improvement in the sense that I'm not physically harming myself. But it's not much of an improvement in a broader sense because this time, I'm causing distress and harm to others. It was much better back when I would just hit myself - you'd be surprised at how people can overlook a person beating themselves in public. I'm trying my best to work towards a healthier way of releasing the anger and tension towards myself. \n\nAugh. The urges are still there. When I feel insecure, I start to wonder what it would feel like if I, well, best not say what is on my mind there. Let's go somewhere a little less dark. I said a little. I considered having someone hit my face really hard with an aluminum bat. Will it suck and possibly lead to my death? Most likely. But the pain will feel so good - I think it'll lift me up from the mire of self hatred I'm in.\n\nAgh.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I had cut so deep that I had this huge gash in my leg. I did this to myself to deal with back pain. It worked, I could feel no more pain. I didn't get the incision sutured. It took nine weeks to heal.\n\nI've made many deep incisions and lacerations over the past two years, on my arms and neck. I have very prominent scars on my body from doing this to myself. I've gotten sutures many, many times. I've cut veins many times, and have even nicked arteries. It's been a lot of visits to urgent care, as well as the ER. \n\nDeep cuts require an explanation, every time you go in for sutures. You will be poked and prodded, both physically and psychologically. When you become a \"regular\" at urgent care or the ER, it comes with a burden of shame you have to carry with you. Bedside manners can change when you go in for treatment a lot.\n\nAll of this to say, please don't follow in my footsteps. If you must self-harm, please keep those wounds shallow and manageable. If you do make a deep cut, go to an urgent care centre or ER for sutures, and try your best not to cut that deep again. Deep cuts come with a heavy burden alongside the prominent scars.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Here's mine", "author": "Benners-Peach-Tea", "self_text": "TW FOR DIRECT LANGUAGE (like using the words instead of yeet and big yeet\"\n\n\n\nSo far I've had 4 and could remember 3. \n\nThe one I can't remember, I remember he feeling of immense sadness because it was a suicide attempt. \n\nDREAM TWO: The second one was after I saw my friend get her gauze removed from a surgery. It was just a little string shoved into a small hole in her armpit, but I know that's what triggered this dream. \n\nSo dream two starts off with me walking down the sidewalk towards my house after I just got out of being stitched up for a suicide attempt. Somberly I pull both string gauze out of my suicide wounds not caring if I live or die and I continue walking home.\n\nThe somber feelings in both dreams are ones I've experienced rarely and only when I have the impulse to kill myself (which I've had only two or three times which were kinda bad). Side note: I've never gone through with an attempt, I've only gotten to the impulse stage when I then go \"wtf, no.\"\n\nDREAM THREE: The next dream happened pretty recently. So here I am, taking a needed nap and all of the sudden I get a text from my mom with all my pictures of my cuts. Every.single.one. \n\nI'm freaking out. My brain isn't working because I'm so scared. My feet go cold, my fingers struggle to type, I can't even think of one complete word because of how much I am shutting down. I'm trying to text her back and say something like \"why have you invaded my privacy like this? These were hidden for a reason. I am not ready to get help yet.\"\n\nBut then I fucking wake up. My heart is racing, I'm nearly crying, my hands and feet are tingly, but I reason to myself that it didn't happen. \n\nThen I went back to sleep.\n\nDREAM FOUR: So this one actually happened last night. So I'm at some sort of school event and I'm trying to find a good stall to go cut in so I go to the last stall. For some reason there is no door at first but I think it should be okay because I'm on the end and people should be able to see my feet and know not to walk all the way down, except this bitch walks into the one across from me, but she has a door. Eventually one appears and I'm able to close it. All of the sudden, a ton of guys start running out from behind me (like the wall) and run out of my stall. Apparently there was a hidden door in my stall. \n\n(So a little analysis on my part. I'm thinking this was just me representing how afraid I was too get caught because I was fearful the entire time)\n\nAfter I get interrupted, I say fuck it because I'm frustrated. I cut on my arm/wrist because I don't care anymore. I make a deep, gapey styro, but it doesn't bleed. I slap a band-aid on it anyways. \n\nSo I go out of the school bathroom and now it's onto the school event, which is kinda like the Hunger Games, but more mild. We are in teams and have a period of time to ransack nearby places for supplies. I (thinking of the future) take a ton of bandaids and first aid supplies. \n\nAnyways I bring it back to my teams tent and a dude from another team (classic Chad, but brunette) is trying to fight me. He's basically double my height and I'm like \"haha nope.\" So we he ends up chasing me for a bit and I eventually find the headmaster guy. \n\nI make the tough decision to show him that I am already injured by dramatically peeling away my band-aid and he takes the other guy away, disqualified. Because he is disqualified his stuff has been removed from the campsite. \n\nSo I walk to my campsite and my tent and teammates are gone. I've been disqualified because I hurt myself and I had to go home, which was dishonorable.", "subreddit": "MadeOfStyrofoam"}

Today I broke. I\u2019ve been fighting these severe thoughts for so long, the visualizations, the overwhelming and all-consuming feeling of pain, the dissociations that I found myself unable to come back from for hours, and I\u2019ve been so good at fighting the craving - until today. Lately the thoughts haven\u2019t even been thoughts, they were almost like facts. Like, you\u2019re going to cut yourself today. Today\u2019s the day you\u2019re going to mutilate yourself again. You\u2019re not strong enough to keep yourself from doing it, so why even try? I thought, maybe I just need one more cut to bring myself down to earth again. \n\nI\u2019ve been doing EMDR and somatic experiencing twice a week for almost two months now, and as much progress as we\u2019re making, I feel like it\u2019s making me worse. I was expecting that, since we\u2019ve been having to work on my complete detachment from my emotions since my latest trauma. I knew that I would have to start feeling again, and it scared the shit out of me because the last times I truly felt things I started self-harming. I was doing so good... and I\u2019m so disappointed in myself for giving in to my sickness. I hate myself. I feel like there\u2019s no hope, that I\u2019m disgusting and unworthy of love. But at the same time, I\u2019m riding this high from the pain-relieving chemicals rushing through my brain. Honestly, I\u2019ve missed it - but that also makes me feel worse. How can someone MISS mutilating their own body? I guess I still believe I deserve abuse, and since there\u2019s no one else around to do it I just do it to myself.\n\nPlease, if there\u2019s anyone out there who\u2019s overcome the need to self-harm to ground themselves after dissociating... how did you do it? How did you stop completely?\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I cut for the first time in 6 months after fighting the need to for so long, and I feel hatred for myself but also ecstatic from the high that comes from the relief of my emotional pain.

I ended up relapsing but since I gave him most of my things it wasn't physically bad at all.   \n\n\nI've resolved the enrollment issue and have tentative plans in place to make school manageable, and I think at this point I don't need him to hold onto them.

Wearing long sleeves isn\u2019t obvious at all at the moment as it is cold here but I really hate sleeved shirts and I keep rolling my sleeves up without noticing. It\u2019s like an automatic thing. A friend of mine already saw my cuts because of this (but turns out it\u2019s not a bad thing because knowing my history with self harm she was really good in bringing it up in a sensitive way and supporting me.).I haven\u2019t cut since that day (about 2 weeks ago) and my wounds have healed but they are still super obvious red scars and I just don\u2019t want anyone else to see them as long as they are that fresh. Does anyone have advise on how to stop rolling up my sleeves automatically? \nThanks in advance.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

And lost it. They walked away without me, even though lunch wasn't over yet. I decided to let my boyfriend who goes to another school, ask my \"friend\" why they were being distant.\nThis is the shortened, less rude version of the whole list of what they said.\n-[redacted] has a tendency to judge people he doesn't know, he saw rosa's post and commented \"oh fuck olivia, i hate her\"\n-another example of this: elijah asked for [redacted]'s pronouns. [Redacted] looked disgusted and walked off when elijah said he was trans too.\n-[redacted] prides themself on being mean. Calls himself a self proclaimed bitch. I do that too, but it's obviously a joke with friends. [redacted] even said that if someone showed him their art, and he thought it was bad, he'd say so.\n-however [redacted] chooses to express himself is none of our business but,,,,, i'm pretty sure one time i heard him call himself an e-girl. \n-[redacted] is way too open about his sex life. Like, not every day we want to hear \"GOD I WANT [bf's] DICK UP MY ASS\" during lunch. Like, we get it.\n-you know those people who are MAD loud at 7am? Yeah, that's [redacted]. Social etiquette exists even in public schools.\n- [redacted] is way too opinionated on topics. It's always \"FUCK THIS\" or \"FUCK THAT\" like, maybe if he was a bit more educated on his opinions, this could change.\n-[redacted] brings a very negative energy to the table. Like i get he hasn't had the best life, but in reality, who has? I'm Hispanic, not skinny, and gay. This doesn't mean tyler can't be sad or anything, but when you're putting it up for the world, it kinda ruins everyone else's time too.\n\nReading these just hurt so extremely badly.

If so please focus in on a main cause.\n\nFor me my main cause would be my parents, specifically my mother. It\u2019s not right to place all the blame on them but I feel a portion of it is their fault.\n\nBtw I\u2019m (F15)\n\nAs a child (as well as now), my mother...ummm...let\u2019s say disciplined me harshly as I wouldn\u2019t go as far as to call it abuse. It ranged from a variety of things like slapping, paddling, spanking (with hand or belt), backhanding (rings hurt bro), pulling my hair or ear, dragging me, scratching me, slamming me into walls, throwing sharp or heavy objects at me, punching, kicking, hitting me with whatever is in her hand (ruler, spatula, book, phone), grabbing my jaw and squeezing, pinching, etc. \n\nWhy she does these things I\u2019m not to sure but she claims it\u2019s the right way to raise a child and that that\u2019s how she was raised. She also tends to scream in my face a lot. For example, today she yelled \u201cF*CK YOU! F*CK YOU! F*CK YOU! F*CK YOU! F*CK YOU! F*CL YOU! HOW DARE YOU?!? NEXT TIME YOU DO THAT I\u2019LL SMASH ALL YOUR FINGERS AND I\u2019M NOT KIDDING!\u201d Keep in mind all I did was move the papers on the stove so I could cook some food for me to eat cause she didn\u2019t feed me -_-\n\nAnyways now that you have some backstory let me dive in. I had always done some sort of self harm as a kid. At the time I didn\u2019t realize what it was but when I was about 4-5ish I would slam my head into any object I could find, pound my fists into the ground, or slap/punch myself till I felt it was sufficient. I did swim lessons too so I would try my best to stay under water so long that my lungs would start to fill with water. \n\nThese types of behaviors continued and worsened as I got older. I would now touch burning pots or pans on purpose, do dangerous activities in order to injure myself (which resulted in a few broken bones and sprained tendons). It wasn\u2019t just physical either. I yelled the same things at myself that my mother yelled at me. Like, \u201cYOU WORTHLESS SPOILED B*TCH! YOU TREAT ME LIKE THE DIRT UNDER YOUR SHOE! GO DIE FOR ALL I CARE! YOU\u2019RE AN ASSH*LE! WHY CAN\u2019T YOU BE MORE LIKE YOUR SISTER?!? YOU ARE THE REASON WHY MY MARRIAGE IS FALLING APART! IT\u2019S YOUR FAULT IF WE GET A DIVORCE! GO F*CK YOURSELF!\u201d Etc, etc, etc, the list goes on.\n\n\nYeahhhh.....saying those things isn\u2019t good for the mental health of an 8 year old (or for a 15 yr old lmao).\n\nFrom there it just kinda spiraled out of control and I began cutting myself at the age of 10-11ish. I remember how it started too. It was July 4th at around 10 pm right after annual Fourth of July Party, and what do you know my mom had just screamed at me again for 15 minutes or so. After that, she walked away and told me to clean up. I start to clean up and I notice the watermelon and a giant knife next to it. It\u2019s about 12 inches in length with a serrated edge. I was crying, angry, livid, and wanted to punish myself for making the mistakes I did that day. I picked up the knife put it against my left forearm and just slid it across. I did that about 7 times and then decided to go into the house to do more (I was outside at the time). I went in locked the house door behind me and went into the bathroom, just as I was about to cut myself again there was a knock on the door so I quickly ran to the kitchen, while wrapped in a blanket, to put away the knife. I opened the door and there was my older sisters fianc\u00e9. I remember I was quaking with fear and probably had a strange look on my face cause he said \u201cWhy was the door locked and why did it take you so long to open it?\u201d I lied and said \u201cMom and dead always tell me to lock it and I was busy putting food away.\u201d He gave me a skeptical look and said \u201cUh huh, sureee,\u201d but ultimately dropped the topic.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that I think my sh stems from my desire for self punishment as I had been taught my entire life that that was the answer. I only found out about a year or two ago that it\u2019s not normal for parents to savagely beat and swear at their kids. Even so, I\u2019ll always have pity for me mother cause she must of had a bad life to be this messed up. \n\nDoes anyone else relate? Or if you don\u2019t what\u2019s your story?

That's not normally a problem but I just started doing ultimate Frisbee at school and it's kinda fucked up the way I budget myself.

Now I'm running 'n shit and all if of a sudden my limbs start to go numb my vision gets all dark and splotchy. I know I'm probably going to pass out because this same thing has happened to me before and I just dropped in the middle of the hallway at school, but that's another story. So I tell my friend whose next to me \"hey ****** I'm probably going to pass out in a sec so I'm going to sit out for a bit\" he was confused and I jogged off to the sidelines. When the drill ends he comes over I'm super out of it but I cought it fast enough so as long as I don't run/walk/stand up I'm going to be fine. I make jokes he's not worried but I sit out for the rest of practice. When practice ends I realize I'm going to need a ride even though it's only a 15 minute walk home so I call people but apparently the team captain asked my friend why I was out and he told him (this becomes important later). I go home eat and drink cover myself with some stupid lie I don't even remember. \n\nThe next day I'm in first period and I get sent down to my guidance counselor (GC) and I'm thinking I'm bout to get yelled at because I have a D in English. Turns out my team captain snitched to my GC. Luckily for me the captain didn't give much detail about the matter, so I managed to wriggle out of it saying that it was just that morning not almost two days and, I made up that I was late so I skipped breakfast and I had to do a project during lunch. GC bought it and I got away Scot free. \n\nHowever I have practice tomorrow (today technically because it's 2:30 lmao) and I don't know what to do and I can't stop thinking about what if the captain tries to follow up or watches me closer or this spreads through the team or the school, if it gets to my GC again she will have tell contact parents and they are already super suspicious about me and eating so I'm freaking the fuck out. \n\nWhat do I do MOS?

One of my friends does it way worse.  She uses razorblades and had 4 cuts and some scars today.  She is open to me about it.  Do you think I can talk to her about it?  My life is blessed but ever since my stepmom came, I wasn't allowed to wear anything to school but jeans.  I cant wear slides, flip flops, or scandals.  She never lets me have a view on anything because ''im a kid and she knows best\". I am not allowed to get below and 85 on anything or I will get severely punished.  She also acts like she knows everything.  I have some hermit crabs and she wants me to mist their cage with TAP water Wich is horrible for hermit crabs.  She is over obsessed with my baby brother and doesn't have as much patience as she used to.  Every time i tell her about last few or school she is like \"can I watch my show now I really don't care\"  Im in middle school and it is very stressful.  There was this one kid from before I moved to Georgia and he would touch my butt and he would say horrible things to me. When I moved to Georgia I had a crush on a guy who had a crush on me too.  I didn't want to date but he would constantly try to hold my hand and he would be like come on why won't you kiss me?  And he would try to kiss me.  My neighbor who I hang out with a lot has family problems.  The mother has daddy issues and the dad does drugs.  One day their pitbull escaped while they were inside and I was waiting outside for them.  He came outside to me screaming \"HARLEY STOP\" Because it was mauling a chicken to death.  I tried pulling the pitbull of the chicken and the chicken didn't die but then the oldest brother came out and swing it by it's legs into the air until it hit the ground.  Then my friend just looked at me and walked inside.  Once their dad was drunk and Harley escaped again so I went to go get her like I always do and he started screaming at me so I ran to the backyard and started crying.  Like ugly crying.  Then he tried to strangle my friend so his little sister (also my friend) walked me home.  When I was little my mother was horrible.  She always beat me and made me eat soap while she recorded it.  I was yelling \"I don't want to die\" and she just laughed at me.  She also made our dog run away until we found the dog again.  When I was older she left.  I also have health issues since when she was pregnant with me she was still a stripper until her baby bump was visible.  She also smoked and drank while she was pregnant.  Because of this I have a thing called scoliosis that hurts my spine. Once she left me with a nice lady whom I called aunt Christina but aunt Christina was also a stripper and a prostitute.  My dad is always at work and when I try do do stuff with him my stepmom ruins it. I'm pretty sure I can be an actress because I can cry on command if I think about my life.  I'm I depressed?  What do you think about my life am I normal?", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I'm part of the BDSM community, and while most people are respectful and understanding, I did get asked about my scars quite a lot, and they tend to be on display at ... *ahem* ... \"parties.\" I've had more than a few people tell me they think my scars are sexy, so I finally posted this:\n\n**TW for descriptions of self harm**\n\nSo I'm making this post inspired by one recent comment, but it was one of many and this isn't meant to call any one specific person out or to make anyone who's said something feel guilty. If you've told me you think my scars are sexy I don't continue to hold it against you, but it really does make me uncomfortable. I'm not ashamed of them, but I don't want to sexualize them either, and it bothers me on a visceral level when others do.\n\nI say pretty explicitly on my profile \"I'm not ashamed of them [my scars], but they're not a fun sex thing and telling me you think they're hot will not go over well.\"  \nThat was my attempt to put it kindly and euphemistically. But it doesn't really explain why.\n\nMy scars aren't there to be sexy. The memories they're associated with are not sexy. They're tied to some of the worst parts of my life and the height of my self-loathing, shame, guilt, and disgust with myself.   \nI was at a play party in [larger city] recently and they used isopropanol instead of madacide to clean the equipment. Being hit with the overpowering smell, even more than a year later, I was struck with strong memories and feelings associated with sitting in my shower, the entire thing sterilized, cutting and suturing myself until 6 in the morning and then getting ready for work after a night with no sleep after significant blood loss, anemic as fuck and completely exhausted. I did this more than a few times. That's what some of those scars are from. Others were times I decided I had to pay for some mistake I'd made, punishment and penance for being a bad person, cutting until the deep feelings of guilt and shame eased up a little.   \nThey're Bs on exams I didn't study hard enough for, stupid mistakes at work, presentations that didn't go as well as I'd wanted. Times I failed others and let them down. Times I felt I failed to live up to some impossible standard. Times I wasn't good enough or times I just wanted to make someone hurt for the pain I felt and decided that person should be me.   \nThey're the reason all the docs at the local ER know me. They're nerve damage so when a partner runs their fingers along my arm or leg it just doesn't feel quite the same. They're itchy and deep and permanent marks of my many years of struggle with mental illness. They're uncountable, certainly thousands if not tens of thousands. They're impossible to miss, but seeing is not understanding.\n\nMy scars mean many things to me, but it's important to me that those are the meanings that I ascribe to them, not meaning or significance that others place. I don't want others judging or defining them, as sexy or a badge of honor or \"tiger stripes\" or a mark of strength or any other meaning that I didn't choose to give them. They're not there for the aesthetics. They're not there for your viewing pleasure. They're not there to share my story with you any more than I choose to. They're not there to show how \"brave\" and \"strong\" I am. They're not your scars, they're mine. They're part of me.\n\nAnd I promise they're not some taboo you can't acknowledge. I'm fine with talking about them, I just don't want others placing any significance on them for me. When you touch my scars you're just touching part of my body, unless you make it more than that. If you touch my scars with significance in some symbolic way, that's an entirely different matter and unless we're quite close it's probably something I didn't agree to and don't want to share with you.\n\nIf you've commented on my scars in the past, don't worry about it. At least you're not the guy who wrote me a long and unsolicited and objectively terrible poem about them. But please don't share your opinions of them with me. Let me decide for myself what they mean to me and how much of that I'm willing to share with you. Until that point, they're just scars. It's just my body.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

So, I've had a long history with self harm. I started when I was 14 and stopped after I was caught and threatened with being sent to the local psych ward. I was clean for a few years, relapsed and felt awful about it and even cried when I confessed to my now ex about it. Recently though, in the past 3 months, i picked the habit back up again but this time it's different. It just feels... like no big deal anymore. Before it felt like such a huge deal but now it's just like part of my ritual. It doesnt serve the same function at all anymore its just like a thing I do now. However, irs escalated. More cuts, deeper, stealing blades from my job (I work retail and we have box cutters they give us) and actually like... knowing which blades work best and under what conditions. It's almost down to a science and when I do cut, its deeper than ever before and more in a single sitting than ever before. \nRecently, earlier this week I even carved a pentagram into my skin. Now, I dont believe in the devil at all or hell. So it's not like I'm trying to be satanic when like I dont think satan exists at all. It's just like. Hey, thisll be something new and fun. Obviously its escalated to this new level. \n\nHas anyone else like experienced this kind of like normalization of the act and escalation? Like I keep trying to find research on this but I cant find anything to see if this is indicative of a psychotic break or something. I never tell anyone about it and dont care to. I'd bring it up to my therapist but I'm always scared that theyll just lock me up so I've never mentioned that I relapsed or that I've done it again.  I will mention I found out that I've been living with untreated bipolar disorder for the past 5 years with meds that only make it worse since the person who diagnosed me with bipolar disorder used the old name and my second one didnt know the old name so the diagnosis was thrown out.

Technically. I began slow, but, I just really want to look out for myself before this gets worse.\nI\u2019m effeminate. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being effeminate. I don\u2019t hate effeminate guys. But the thing is I don\u2019t want to be effeminate. Before moving to where I live rn, I was constantly bullied because of my effeminate behaviour and mannerisms. I hated myself. I did not want to be seen. You know, to put that pressure on a 12 year old sucks, because that really fucked me up. I couldn\u2019t live one day without telling myself I had to be someone else, and failing that day.\nI moved and people changed, things changed, everything changed. I\u2019m not bullied anymore, and I felt happy. I had a self-esteem. Until last week, when I found out \u201ceveryone has thought I\u2019m gay at one point.\u201d. Had it not been for the people I had met back in the day, I would not have done any of this. I wouldn\u2019t have felt sad or offended or had the trauma return. My father\u2019s been constantly telling me to \u201cact like a man\u201d when he saw me do anything of feminine nature, but that\u2019s only because he loves me, and he doesn\u2019t want me to be treated poorly like I was before. I used to fucking return home from school crying. And I feared that it would be a cycle that went on and on, over and over again. So this week I did something I had been planning but never executed.\nI devised a discipline method.\nFor each time I caught myself doing something unmanly, I\u2019d hurt myself. It started with a leather belt to my legs. But last night I took a nail cutter, and quickly grazed my arm with it. I felt worthless. Sad. Emotionless. And today I hit myself with the belt several times and scraped on my arm several times too. They\u2019re not deep cuts, but I heard this is where it starts. My parents would kill me. I\u2019d be under constant vigilation. \nBut I admit I need to stop. I don\u2019t want advice, or consolation. I just want to vent and admit to myself that this is toxic behavior. I have tried to make myself throw up many times these past days, but I didn\u2019t have enough energy. But I\u2019ll be glad I wrote this in the long run. At least I hope so. \n(I\u2019m not against LGBT, I just relived a \u201ctrauma\u201d from when I was younger because people used to bully me over this, and make me feel miserable. While I haven\u2019t been treated rudely, it did spark a very strong emotion of anger and sadness. These people have told me to not pretend to be another person; but I just want to be like every other guy at my school.)", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I was absent from self harming for months and rarely self harmed during my first year. It was fine to go. \n\nBy 2018, it started staging to where I cut about once in 1-4 months. But that\u2019s nothing compared to how to became at 2019. During the beginning of 2019, I would cut about once in 2 weeks. The number of scars became more by each time as I just wanted to feel the burning feeling of doing so. It is my escape for feeling sorrow. But by June-July 2019, It worsened way much. My mom started screaming at my face whenever I cut. She threatened me too many times about it. And my grandma just thinks telling me to stop cutting would actually stop me from cutting. And my sister just never understood me and made fun of me for it. By that, I started cutting my thighs since I only wear long pants. It became way more addicting. Now I can\u2019t stay a week without cutting. And sometimes I found it disturbing to look down at my thighs. I found myself less mobile at times and it burns and itches too bad. \n\nWhen I use to self harm my arms, at least I use to cut less just so I would be less embarrassed. But since this is a body part no one is looking down at, I did a little too much.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Started doing things I probably shouldn\u2019t have to do just to please others. I just want my family to like me. The thought of anyone disliking me or being annoyed with me terrifies me. More than anything, honestly. I feel like people at times take advantage of my leniency with being treated poorly. But that\u2019s fine, at this point it\u2019s hard to genuinely believe I deserve better. And if I did I\u2019m too scared of possibly being left alone to bother seeking out a better situation. I\u2019d rather stay in a shitty situation than have my family abandon me. Maybe it\u2019s an autism or depression or social anxiety thing or a general self esteem problem, I don\u2019t know what makes me like this exactly.\n\nAt least I haven\u2019t cut today though, at least sucking up to people prevents my mood swings right? Nearly all of my cuts are fully healed again and I\u2019m very excited :) My eating habits could be better, but I don\u2019t really care to recover from my ED yet, I\u2019m too attached to it since it makes me feel more in control over myself. I feel extremely depressed today, but I managed to clean my whole house (just to make my family happy of course lol but at least I did it... hopefully they\u2019ll be happy with it). And I only contemplated suicide once! Only had a couple mood swings, not unmanageable ones. Which is a sign of some improvement I think.\n\nI am having an identity crisis again which kinda sucks. Every once in a while I get into a weird episode where I just become unstable in every way. It sucks because this time it revolves around my sexuality again, even though I thought I had figured it out already. What\u2019s the difference between romantic love and hero worship? I don\u2019t even know. I just don\u2019t know who I am lol. I think it\u2019s why my ED has gotten worse again, at least I know I\u2019m a person with an eating disorder, if nothing else.

This is going to be long, so if you don\u2019t want to read it all, you don\u2019t have to.\n\nI\u2019ve struggled with depression for the majority of my life. Middle school amplified that. I was bullied heavily, and I was outed for being bisexual, which only made it worse. My home situation wasn\u2019t good either. I had an abusive stepfather and a mother that was working horrible hours to try to keep the lights on. I felt that the only control I had in my life was hurting myself. Cutting was primarily what I did, although I tried other things as well. I have an addictive personality, so it didn\u2019t end well\u2014at one point I was doing it just to function correctly. Then my mother found out, and I had to quit for some months at a time. \n\nThen, in 2014, my mother got ill and went into the hospital. This left me alone with my abusive stepfather, so naturally, I relapsed. When she passed away in early 2015, I had the worst relapse yet. Ever since her funeral, I\u2019ve been clean. All of the changes in my life at that time distracted me from my own mind, so I managed to kick the habit for a while. \n\nNow, I\u2019ve graduated high school and am going to college in January. I\u2019ve been struggling with my mental health again and am having extremely bad urges to relapse. All of my scars are covered in tattoos, but goodness, the temptation is strong. I haven\u2019t picked up a blade yet, but I have been bruising myself, if it counts. I\u2019m afraid to tell my boyfriend about these thoughts because I\u2019m afraid he won\u2019t be able to handle it, and my father is a military father, so he doesn\u2019t believe in getting help.

Mid June I started to act on my self harming thoughts, with cutting and scratching. I haven't been cutting nearly as much these past few months because people were asking about my scars, although I do still struggle with urges. I've never had a particularity healthy relationship with food, skipping meals a lot, and generally eating crap. About two weeks ago I made a decision to start using food as a way to hurt myself. Since then I've eaten about 600 calories a day, with most of those being \"social calories\". If I didn't eat then, people would have asked questions and I can't let anyone know I'm trying to hurt myself. My \"goal' was 500-700 calories a day, and I stuck to that pretty well. I've started giving myself more and more \"rules\" as to how much I can eat and have started planning out what I will eat when. Today I \"slipped up\" and ate like 1200~(half a box of mac and cheese, 4 small cookies and a pack of pop tarts). I feel good because I'm full, but I feel so bad for eating so much in one day. My mind has been racing with ways to \"make it up\", like not eating tomorrow. I really don't know how I got here, but I'm pretty sure I'm going to have a full on eating disorder soon if I can't sort out how to stop. I don't really feel \"ready\" to give up SH, if anyone knows what I mean. I feel like I quit cutting for the wrong reasons, not because I was truly ready to stop. \n\nI know why I was cutting, because I felt I had made mistakes, was worried I'd mess up my future, or because I was lonely. I really and truly can't pinpoint why I'm starving myself. I know I'm not overweight, and I still don't eat when I'm around people having a good time. Maybe its just general self loathing?

I should start by explaining that Ann has a very supportive family.  Ann's mom was pregnant by another man when she married Ann's \"Dad.\"  Ann spent the first 9 years of her life thinking this man was her father only to find out he isn't her biological father.  Now this man has been a father in every sense of the word, he's supported and loved Ann from the moment she was born.  I'm not sure why her Mom and \"Dad\" decided not to tell her about her real father and keep it a secret but since Ann has found out the truth she's struggled a lot with depression and cutting herself.  We found cuts on her arms about a year ago and signed her up for therapy.  She's been in 1 on 1 sessions for a year now and even included family therapy and group therapy.  We thought the cutting had stopped until we found a broken razor this week and fresh cuts on her arm.  In my personal opinion I think Ann has trouble trusting the adults in her life because they lied to her about her biological father.  Ann and I have a very close relationship and I feel like we can talk about anything.  I just feel so lost in this situation because I don't know the right thing to say and I don't want to do any more damage than already has been done.  I'm writing this to get some advice from people who are more knowledgeable on this topic.  Ann really likes to read and in the past I've found books to help her with different situations in life.  Are there any books for young girls that self-harm?  What are things I should avoid saying/doing?  I love her immensely and will do anything to help her.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

It was great, I guess: it was hard a daily battle. those months were terrible, I was bound and determined not to  cope that way. Then one day my husband was being a jerk, (like the typical I can\u2019t drive, I am a retard. I lost my shit I stood up for myself, explaining actually I can drive cause I am not the one who lost my license for the 2nd time. ) then I went numb completely and utterly numb, I remember him losing it after I stood up for my self, you know the old song and dance...\n\nI just wanted to know I still felt something. That I wasn\u2019t as dead inside as I felt. So I just carved my hand up, in the same place, whilst driving. Husband was then so high on dope he didn\u2019t notice or care. \n\nEver since then I have had to do it weekly. I\u2019m back just to cutting. (My mom saw my hand and immediately freaked, granted it was kinda big and she just knows the slippery slope I had with it in the past. ) but now for the last week it\u2019s been daily. \n\nI can\u2019t just do one. I have to do 7 at a time. 3 on one and 4 on the other. I usually end up having around 21-28 a day. \n\nIt used it help, and it does for the first 15 mins. But it\u2019s like there is this massive blackness in my core just eating me away. It doesn\u2019t hurt. I am not sad. I am just nothing. I don\u2019t care. About anything. The thing is, I want to stop, I want to care again. I want too, I just don\u2019t. Like nothing.... \n\nYes, I know my husband sounds like a total jerk. He is. He has been our whole relationship, but you know, can\u2019t deal. I tried to tell him I didn\u2019t care about anything anymore... and he said he didn\u2019t want to hear my mouth, to shut up. I said, what made you so mad, he said your attitude and is now sleeping in the other room so he doesn\u2019t have to be around my negativity. This all started because I have slept all weekend, and didn\u2019t clean house like normal or cook. That\u2019s when I told him I didn\u2019t care about anything, specifically dishes, cooking or my life. \n\nI just want to feel again. Even if it\u2019s pain, hurt, loss and sadness. I haven\u2019t felt anything in a long time, except the pain/relief I give myself on the daily but that doesn\u2019t last. And it\u2019s not real. \n\nI never have posted. I don\u2019t have any friends. My best friend died 4 months ago today. My husband is a addict and doesn\u2019t care about me but about his high (which I know is all an addict cares about) . I am estranged from most my family right now because of him. The career I worked so hard for the past 5 years is going down the toilet.  I should feel, but I don\u2019t. At all.

I first started cutting about 7 years ago and i tried again this morning. Back then, i took the blade out of a pencil sharpener and used that, this morning... I don\u2019t know. I went to the bathroom and thought i could take one of the razors apart to the blade but i couldn\u2019t so I just grabbed this eyebrow razor thing. Real tiny blade. I\u2019ve been thinking about relapsing for 3 months straight now, and this while time ive been kinda scared of infections so i dumped some rubbing alcohol on the blade and used a lighter because that\u2019s what i\u2019ve seen in movies. And i went at it. Just this one portion of my arm that i thought would be easy to cover. Nothing really deep, only a tiny bit of blood, my hands shook a lot and i didn\u2019t really feel all that different after i did it versus before. I was good about disinfecting it and applying a bandage, something i didn\u2019t do years ago because i was 11 and stupid. i was going to buy a box cutter or find one around my house so that I could do it, but i don\u2019t have any money so i avoided it. \n\nOn one hand, after months of thinking about it... I\u2019ve finally done it. I didn\u2019t feel anything except for the physical pain of it, and with the eyebrow razor you can\u2019t really go hard with it because there\u2019s a lot of plastic so the exposed blade is quite small. A few days ago I thought about cutting on my leg because i thought it would be easy to hide but then i remembered that big ass blood vessel you have tuning down your leg and decided against it. Because it\u2019s been so long since i self harmed and there\u2019s a bunch of stuff coming on in my life, i\u2019m kinda scared of what I\u2019d do to myself. Before i never went \u2018deep\u2019 and i feel like all of these pent up feelings i might end up hurting myself too bad and having to go to the hospital for it. I had this idea of just... wanting to go as hard as i could and bleeding as much as i can over and over again without dying and now after this tiny relapse, a tiny part of me is just... ready to save up enough money to buy the box cutter like i wanted and to see how much i can hurt myself.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I went to try on another short sleeve shirt and my mum decided to come in with me so she wouldn't have to wait in the small hallway with a pram blocking anyone. She asked me first if I wanted her in the room and without thinking I said yes. I realised my mistake when I went to change. \n\nI tried to take of my shirt weirdly so that she wouldn't see the bruising but once the short sleeved shirt was on she saw them. I had prepared an excuse, so when she asked about the big bruise (which was the only one she saw at first) on my arm, I quickly said it was because I kept accidentally smacking my door (My door has stuff behind it so when you got to open it, it kinda pushes back, which she knew). She immediately knew I was lying, especially because I start smiling when I'm nervous or lying. She then noticed the other small bruises and grabbed my arm to take I look. I was internally freaking out at this point and just wanted to start crying. I pulled my arm away and she asked to see my arm again. I used the excuse 'can I at least put my shirt back on' and she let me. After I put my my long sleeve shirt on I quickly asked what she thought of the shirt, avoiding the subject.\n\nI was extremely stressed for the rest of the day, worried to say certain things incase they would remind my mum about the bruises. I got so upset with myself because I promised I wouldn't let her find out and now I just feel horrible. Because of how stressed I was it made my OCD compulsions become a bit harder to control.\n\n(Sorry this was so long, I just needed to get it off my chest)", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Now, when I theoretically live alone it is easier for me to hide the scars or wounds. I don't feel any form of control from my grandparents or family in general because they don't know about all of that. I started doing this because my dad got sick like five years ago and because I was only a child I didn't understand his illness. And at the and of July 2019 my mom died from cancer after a year of fighting. Because of this, problems in my relationships and stress related to new school I can hurt myself few days a row. Usually I do it on my hips, it's so much easier to hide it there. But today I burned skin on my arm with matches several times. It was really interesting feeling and I quite liked that. So I started to wonder will it ever end? Or will it follow me for the rest of my life? So far I don't treat this like a real problem like I used to do because now I don't have any consequences from this. Do you think I should do something about all of this?

But, I recently managed to make some friends and I also started cutting again for unrelated reasons. One of my friends is very caring and has told everyone that he\u2019ll listen if you need to talk. So, I told him that I started again, I don\u2019t want to tell my family for reason I\u2019m sure you guys can probably guess, but I I need to have someone to talk to. I do have a therapist but I don\u2019t want to tell her either, because I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll get put on a watch list or something and that\u2019s not gonna help at all.\n\nStill, now that I\u2019ve told him I\u2019ve started to feel bad about it.

I can't. My dreams force their way back, taunting, jeering.\n\nI sit up. My body struggles to hold me up like the framework of my family that is slowly crumbling and tearing. The pictures I left on my thighs scream like my uncle did to me as he was coming off his high. Kill yourself he yelled at me. I tried I replied. You're worthless he cried. But I already know. I've known, as what kind of son can't even take care of their own mother.\n\nI try to stand. As I lean my body forward all that I see is my constant failures at doing anything I know I'm capable of doing. I know I can stand, I did it yesterday. Then why does it seem as if I've never stood before in my life. I can't bring strength to my legs as I have no will to waste my strength on myself while my mother barely has enough to wake up.\n\nI leave my room. As I leave I can feel the demons breathing down my neck. I can feel judgement's gavel swinging through the air. As my sentence is determined I feel anxiety wrapping it's chains back around me. I see pain's shadow as he flies circles around my head, reminding me of his existence. Like I needed it. \n\nI walk to the bus. As I'm walking a chain gets pulled a little as anxiety questions if we are too late and missed it. Pain is busy reminding me about last nights artwork. At the bus stop judgement shows me the other's laughter and taunting comments. Here comes the mistake is what seems to be pinned not just on my back but everywhere as no matter what angle you view me everyone seems to know.\n\nI arrive at school. As i walk towards my friends, i hear anxiety question their motives. After all, no one wants to be near me. As we talk I can feel them looking for an escape from my presence. So I give it to them. As I walk to class I can feel students changing their path to avoid me, likely preferring the plague over me. During class I don't talk. I can't talk. Talking means I need to pull the chains anxiety has placed around me away from my body long enough to be able to speak. But anxiety is stronger than I. I look at the work we are given just to hand it back blank. Depression makes sure I don't do it. It goads the others into torturing me more. It goads me into hating myself. Hating my weakness. It makes me jealous. Jealous that others can live and look happy about it. While others are succeeding I'm failing at everything. \n\nI go home. I go back home just to do nothing. I hear my mother struggling to make dinner. I watch her struggle to get ready to buy groceries. I hear her tell me she's fine. But she's not fine. She tells me I'm fine. I have to be. I have to be there for her. But while I'm there for her, it's only in presence. I'm too pathetic to offer to help with dinner. I refuse to buy groceries for her. I'm failing at being a son. I hear anxiety ask if she even wants me here. She probably doesn't. Why would she. I've already abandoned her. Just like everyone else me. I play games as a distraction. It helps lighten the chains around me. If but for a moment. But it's only delaying the inevitable. It's just a useless action. My pained mother brings me my dinner. She won't eat, as she has no strength for it. I stare at it and nibble at it. Only to feel disgusted by it. I can practically feel the weight gaining as I eat. I stop, just to throw away the dinner my mother used her days worth of strength for. I force myself to hold in whatever I did eat. It's all I do for her. At night I go to take a bath. Why laying in the bath, I can feel my skin getting softer. Losing whatever strength it managed to keep. I put my head under water just to keep it there. I start counting. 1. 2. 3. 5. 10. 30. 60. 100. I come up. I can't do it. Depression is down there looking back. Taunting. While anxiety is using it's chains to keep me up. I get out and dry off, just to sit back down before getting dressed. I take up my brush. And make some new artwork. My body is my canvas. I paint myself new pictures. I watch as the ink runs down the canvas and fills in my lines. I put my brushes down and admire the work. This is my true relief. Judgement admits the work is quite nice. Anxiety is glad it has no places to attach it's chains. Pain is getting stronger. And depression starts to back away, as I've done what it asked. I remember to scrub the ink out of the now glistening tiles surrounding my feet. I struggle to stand and tentatively place my clothes back over my body. I look in the mirror and watch as my demons relish in my life. I can practically smell the brimstone and hear the screams as the temperature in the room rises. For a moment I remember I'm in hell. I turn back around and leave the room. I head back to my bed and lay down, knowing that ink will leak through and stain my sheets. I go to sleep hoping that tomorrow I'll wake up and the demons will be gone, but anxiety informs me I'm wrong. And depression lays it's arms over me embracing me for the night. \n\nI wake up.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

The reason I'm bringing this up is because I don't want (family friend and kids) to see or ask about them so can you please cover them with foundation.\" \n\nLuckily she agreed, pretending to believe I had gotten them from \"accidentally\" smacking my arms on my door (an excuse I used when I first got caught and). \n\nIt was EXTREMELY AWKWARD when she had to put the foundation on. At first it was completely silent which made me so uncomfortable, like my throat would close up; so I tried to make some conversation, joking about a couple of random things.

I wouldn't have asked her for help if i had foundation or if I knew her foundation was close to my skin tone and knew how to apply it. \n\nI'm starting to think that my mum believes I'm not SH anymore (I am).
