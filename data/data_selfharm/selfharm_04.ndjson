This was normal and something I didn't think twice about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA month or so after the break up, I was feeling especially hopeless. I saw the knife on my desk and thought \"I just want to feel something\". I slowly pressed the blade onto the back of my left thumb and then pulled away as fast as I could. There it was. A small and thin red line across my thumb into the back of my hand. It didnt hurt. I did it again. And again. And kept doing it until my left hand has several shallow cuts, all bleeding in unison.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a month of cutting every few days, I decided that I had to stop. But it was hard. I had no motivation to stop. No motivation until my ex and I (the same one) started to get closer again. Not as lovers but as friends. Soon enough we were inseperable best friends. Just being around her made my heart sour, not even romantically, but just out of happiness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, my breif moment in heaven didn't last forever. It was only a few months before we started to become distant. We were both becomming increasingly busy with life. Our schedules just didn't line up anymore. It was like we were on different sides of the planet. Soon enough, I begann to get frustrated with our lack of contact. She was my best friend and I felt like a complete stranger.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe ended up meeting a new guy. That was the day our friendship died. It was also the day a part of me died as well. She pushed me out of her life to make room for her latest obessesion. I was left in the dust. Wondering what I did wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis has all been occuring in the last few weeks. I've been angry. Bitter. Irritable. And just miserable overall. I feel so inadequate. So I started cutting again. All over my left hand. My arm too. I can't stop.

What about a broken childs. These thoughts seem to be worse. The isolation and built up anger of a broken kid eats them up. The absence of a figure can drive them to do terrible things their entire life until they finally confront themselves and ask yourself why? The question \u201cwhy?\u201d Can be the worse one to ask . It leads to anger and self hatred. These feelings buried feels good until you realize what it has made you into. The mood drops/swings. The thoughts haunting my dreams and even my restless nights are what can drive a man crazy. Drive him over the wall or even drive them into a wall. Fullspeed. There's no breaks on a brain. No breaks on a wave of pain and loneliness. Or sometimes the worst, guilt. As kids we are always told to take fault for what we have done. That drives a kid to tell himself it\u2019s his fault for everything that happens to them. Especially when blamed. Someone leaves, I drove them away.  Someone leaves me, I fucked up. Parent does show emotion or perhaps to much, I drove them to this. Alcoholism drapes over a household, I\u2019m the reason they need their potions. Trying to cope with everything they say not too can be just as bad as bottling it up. Writing notes just incase one day I actually have the balls to end it once and for all. One person's mistake can make you have a displeasure for everybody else. Give you the thought that everybody is full of shit. But I realize everybody has their demons but some people feel the need to give people more. THe thought of not being good enough for someone can be the worst. Or the thought that you just lost the most valuable thing in your life will forever be one of those things that hang over my head. The constant want of a true friendship but the only person that I have will leave before I grow old if I even do makes me want to push away everybody so I get all the pain out of the way right there and maybe just maybe that will push me over the edge. I can\u2019t even fall into a deep sleep because if I do I drown in my ocean of thoughts causing the worst dreams I could ever Imagine. Waking up with tears rolling down my face but having no possible way to more for up to 10 minutes is the scariest things. It\u2019s just me and my thoughts about what was on my mind while I slept, The thoughts that never fade and always linger, stalking and waiting till the mood drop makes me vulnerable enough to take advantage of my mind. So that's why I wear headphones, to drown out the thoughts, the voices of other and myself, weather they are actually verbal or mental they still will come back to get me in the ass. Few people actually help which actually has a trend. They are all females. Because I have mommy issues. Like how girls find comfort in guys when they have daddy issues thats me but for my mom. I find comfort in females and find it way easier to open up to which I don\u2019t mind but I know I can never replace my old mom with anyone, not even the new mom I\u2019m stuck with. I can find comfort in girls all I want but nothing will ever be the same so I\u2019m not fixable and I have accepted that. These are the the thoughts that haunt me at night.}    \n    January 10th\n    {Everybody wonders what they could do better in their life. For me it\u2019s not how can I do better. It\u2019s more what did I do wrong? When did I go wrong? What made me this way? And it all comes back to emptiness and uncontrollable loneliness. All comes back to the broken family i walked out on because I was too damn selfish to stay. I try and find faith but all of it sounds like bull shit to me. Church makes the thoughts worse not because of the actual religion but because I see everyone with such hope in themselves and things that make them happy out of thin air and it doesn\u2019t do the same for me. The thought of following rules with some made up consequence nobody has proof of will probably in the end drive me mad. The thought of a so called \u201cheaven\u201d a safe haven just for believing in something doesn\u2019t sound right. A safe haven has never been an actual place more of a person for me. But the person will forever leave me to be happier on their own and I can\u2019t get mad because they are finding happiness. I can be jealous all I want but in the end jealousy means nothing but selfishness. I\u2019m anything but selfish. More selfless. As I come to find out, Selflessness is a never ending battle, You win some and you lose some but the losses are much bigger than the wins. You save someone's life and you feel like a hero. Now to them you are useless and left alone. That makes you want to end your own and question helping other people. But the common thought of not wanting anyone to ever feel the way you do, ever go through what you have, always comes back to bite you in the ass. People are always going to be different and some just stay because they know about the thoughts that go on in my head. That right there is worse then them leaving after being helped. Instead of feeling used you feel betrayed, instead of being a temporary fix you are a long term blow off. The person is too scared to be the reason of you ending your life after you are the reason they didn\u2019t end thiers. If that doesn\u2019t describe betrayal I don\u2019t know what does. The fact that I was someone's coping mechanisme makes me so happy. The thought that later they are the reasons I\u2019m going to the extremes to find more coping mechanisms is what really gets me. Doing the worst to feel like the best. Doing the bad stuff that can end it or be just enough to keep me going.  Just to fall under the haze like my parents of addiction. That\u2019s what made me stop feeding my brain the chemicals that kept it from thinking too much but just enough for what left of a heart I had to keep beating. It\u2019s funny. The chemical offset of my brain is the main reason I think how I do yet adding more of a chemical offset can be the reason I stop thinking like that. Stop thinking at all. Enough to get me away for the night or two. Enough to upset my stomach for a week and maybe even crash a kidney. I don\u2019t fear death. I fear life. I know what\u2019s after death and it\u2019s absolute nothingness and I\u2019m already used to feeling that. There is no telling what comes from life good or bad, that\u2019s what fuels my mind with fear causing me to expect the worse so that when it happens, it goes as plan. And when something good happens I wonder what fucking vase in the house I rubbed just right so my wish came true or at least somewhat true so that the worse didn\u2019t happen. And as long as it isn't the worst I\u2019m fine with it. That\u2019s what I've learned through what I\u2019ve been through. Don\u2019t hope for the best. Prepare for the worst. Lessen the disappointment that way.}\n\nJanuary 11th\n    {People speak of dreams as things they hope to have or visions they have at night. Others dreams are hopeful happy things like find love or get rich. I\u2019m not that simple. I couldn\u2019t care less about money as long as I get by with what I have. Everybody else's literal dreams are always happy or really goofy. Not mine. Ever have an out of body experience dream? Now think about how weird those are. Now think about walking in on yourself killing your self, watching the chair hit the floor while ur feet dangle above the ground and having no way of helping you self. Seeing your self laying on the floor balling with a razor blade to your wrists while the blood seeps out in an endless river of red. Then waking up crying but not being able to move as you lay there straight faced with tears rolling down ur face. Then due to not being able to move you fall back into the bottomless ocean of sadness that all those thoughts circle in. Like sharks with blood in the water. Vicious and cutting just deep enough to fuck your whole day and keeping you thinking about the thoughts, the dreams, the images you just witnessed. Those thoughts will keep you up for the following next few days. Thats damn near weekly for me. The amount of shit that apparently goes through my brain a night is terrifying. It\u2019s worse because nothing can turn off a brain besides death. That\u2019s what is always comes back to is powering off everything, thoughts, movements,organs, and every bit of life. No matter what happens it comes back to thinking I\u2019m better off dead but suicide is selfish they say. If they can make it through life then why can\u2019t I? The answer is because I\u2019m weak. Vulnerable and my own sick mind takes advantage of that.  Isn\u2019t that sick? How you can be your own worst enemy. The fact that the organ that runs your entire body and keeps everything moving can be the one telling you to make it stop. That's why I fill it with foreign chemicals, Slurs the voices in my head so I don\u2019t hear the voices so clear. Maybe even puts them to sleep if I\u2019m lucky. But if i was really lucky then one of the times i drown my thoughts in chemicals it\u2019d finally please my mind and shut my body down forever, but the chances of that aren\u2019t strong enough for me to rely on. To many ways to be saved from an overdose.}\nJanuary 13th\n\n    {The thought of somebody actually enjoying my presence is borderline imaginary. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the fact that I know the things I\u2019ve done  or if it\u2019s the fact that I know the thoughts that go through my head. I don\u2019t know how somebody could ever love somebody as broken and as dark as me. How can somebody ever enjoy the presence of a boy wishing there was a barrel in his mouth just so he can pull the hammer back but never have the time to hear it band against the bullet even though I pulled the trigger. The only reason I\u2019m still here is for other people. To help others not feel the way I feel because nobody deserves to go through what I go through on the daily. When/If I get older and I have my shit together I want to be a counselor for teens just so they don\u2019t go through what I go through. I could connect with them on an unreal amount and it\u2019d be crazy to see how many kids go through hard times. I only know about how many girls in my grade and a bunch of the sophomores go through the same shit as me. But if I ever go through with ending myself I want my family to read this but I want none of them to feel blame. It\u2019s my fault none of theirs but I do want them to know that it was too late to save me ever since 6th grade. I want them to know that I\u2019m sorry. For everything I\u2019ve done and the money they have spent on me because it will have all gone to waste. I mostly want them to know how sorry I am for putting them through this but that\u2019s how I feel every day. But it\u2019s my fault not theirs, they tried to help but I pushed them away. I could have tried to accept their help but instead I thought I was going to be strong enough and relied on time to fix my problems instead of taking the time to fix myself without anyone help. That\u2019s my lost. I\u2019m sorry.}\n\n", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

When she self harms she talks about it rants on her private snap, tells her friends at school, posts self harm memes and shows her closer friends like me her cuts. Now Im not belittling her for cutting for attention thats a valid reason a lot people cut. And because i know her personally i know its because her family doesn't give her enough attention or love. It can be hard to break a self harm habit but I know what helps her case specifically. She needs someone to talk to her pay attention to her and ask how she is and I think ever sense me, her other friends and her now bf have started doing that its helped her a lot and Im so happy that i can help her to try and over come that struggle. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut its different for me, I would flip out if anyone found out i harmed. I would aggressively deny it and blame the marks on something else. I know maybe sometimes maybe i do, do it because i want some one to love me and help me but thats not the main reason for me. I do it to punish myself every part of my mind screams at me that i deserve to suffer and feel pain that its the only way to make up for the wrong I've done and its still not enough.

I don't want to share it with close friends or family because they might worry too much, or think that I'm hungry for attention.

I've been listening to sadder songs, and always feel like crying. I don't feel motivated to do anything, and can't think straight. My grades have been going way lower because I don't study well, but I try to study. I've been having too many distractions from studies, and I have anger issues. I don't get offended easily, but when I do, I overthink a lot of stuff.\n\nMY FRIENDS: A really close friend of mine has depression since 2 years. I only found this out now, because my friend was unsure of it.\n\nI've been having a lot of friendship problems, but I'm not gonna blabber on about it because it's personal, and not that big of a deal.\n\nMy ex best friend lied to everyone about having depression. She's so hungry for attention, it's almost funny when people point that out.\n\nMY FAMILY: They're supportive. But every time we socialise we argue, and they expect so much from me. \n\nME: So I've been self harming. I don't have depression, I'm fine. I think I might have FOMO or anxiety. I have a few other problems as well. I know it's not normal, but from the start I've liked the way scratches and scars look on me.\n\nI used a sharpener blade to cut myself, but it was quick and not deep. There's just something in me that urges me to cut, and I didn't tell anyone because people might think I'm a psycho. Or people might think that gaming affected my brain.\n\nI've told you guys this because I read articles written by people who have been in the same situation as me - not having depression, get urges, for self harm.\n\nIF YOU HAVE EVEN THE TINIEST OF A PROBLEM THAT BUGS YOU, TELL SOMEONE.

This seems like a good supportive place to share and get advice so here goes \n\n(It starts sorta unrealated)\n\nWhen i was younger maybe 12 or so I started really strugling with my school and home life, I was really struggling with my parents we used to constantly argue over the most insignificant things and it drove us both insane (when i say parents i mean mom and stepdad, my mom and dad sperated. Relevant later) \nThis went on for maybe two years or so getting progressively worse, it got to the point where every night we'd fight and it made me hate myself. I couldnt figure out why i was how i was and why they were so much different to me. It made me hate them and hate me so much to the point where i constantly thought about drowning myself. \nI then found out i have ASD and finally had an explanation for all of the shit that was going on and in the october of that year i feel in love with my first girlfriend things were starting to look up and i think i started genuinely being happy for a while but its been three years since then. We started fighting and i always blamed it on myself because i thought differently to everyone else.\nThats around the first time i self harmed. \nI remember thinking \"im sad and this is supposed to make it better right\" \n\nIt didnt help thank god but i started getting consious of the scar on my arm from it and that coupled with my asd becoming a problem again i began getting anxous and not the \" oh no my exams\" kind. It was the crying running screaming pannic attack kind whenever i was in a class where the students spoke to loudly and it lead to me staying in bed and making myself be sick in a desperate attempt at getting a day off. I find it kinda funny to think my mom thought i was just sick or faking like normal kids. \nThe panic attacks and anxiety and autism struggles all culminated in what i still consider one of my worst days. \nI got so bad one week that i made myself vomit for a week straight which made me freak out and have the worst attack ive had untill that point it which my mom decided to get my dad involved because of how much time ive had off. He decided that there was no mental health problems and that i was bullshiting and on drugs. He dragged my around my fucking room by my hair and tried to drag me outside. I have dreams where i hear him screaming at me and pulling me out of my door so hard i tore my forearms on my door frame leading me to go to hospital.\n\nAfter this i managed to get put into a crisis team and was assigned a therapist. You guessed it things were looking up again untill i started having problems with my at the time first girlfriend. \nAnd that ladies and gentlemen is where the true self harm part begins. We started having problems because of her, she hardly ever spoke to me even though i called her every day and tried to meet her as often as i could. She just wasnt interested but whenever id say it was making me feel bad shed spin it and blame it on me. Yet again i stared hating myself and then i told myself i deserved to cut. That was about a year ago and i managed to stop for a while \nWe broke up a few months ago and i blame it all on me. I shouldnt have told her she was making me sad it wasnt fair on her. \nThats not the point im saying all of this. In all honesty its because im scared. Its been getting worse lately. It used to be only to the point where it was like falling into a thorn bush but like i said its getting more severe. Last night it took 20 minutes for the bleeding to stop and i dont know what to do. \nCan anyone give me some advice please. Just please dont say the usual things like \"go to your doctor\" or \"tell your parents\" because ive tried both. My parents just got mad and all my doctors have told me unless my life is in danger theres nothing they can do. So please if anyone has any advice send it my way.\n\nJust as a note im not verry good at this kind of stuff so sorry this is so long and dumb.

Then, she said it was a joke and started laughing again. She then asked why it got me so upset...I honestly cannot deal with my family anymore.\n\nI then proceeded to cut, just a few mins ago, after having been clean for like a week (not too long, but it was something for me). I find April Fool\u2019s jokes so damn stupid, especially if they have to do with such sensitive topics like death.

There's a beautiful forest inside of me, dense bushes of lush flowers bloom, but in the midst of it all, there's a pit. It's a sinkhole, expanding, the forest is collapsing into the pit. Everything that's good about me disappears into the pit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen people first meet me, they always seem to be enamored by my friendliness, until they enter the forest and they see the sinkhole. Then they run away and once again I'm alone. I try to shield my pit from their eyes, but somehow it's always discovered. I try so hard not to overshare, and to not talk about my past traumas to them because I know it'll just chase them away. And I'm so tired of people always leaving me. I pour my heart out to them, and they can't bear it, although I never once ask them to help me carry anything. I know my trauma is mine alone to carry.

I don't feel the need to text him or call him.\n\nI will probably see him this weekend (if he doesn't break up with me before then) and if I keep up this coping mechanism to avoid being overbearing I'm afraid he will see. I don't blame him for my relapse. I am responsible for my own actions.  I never have cut deep and have always been able to stop myself form cutting too much. Hopefully I can completly stop again.

It's the typical excuse I give everyone. She then told me to roll up my sleeve so she could put on a new bandage on for me. She began to ask me many questions about my cat like what color, how old, and what's it's name and gender. I know it was to see if I was lying about the scars on my arm though but I just played along with it. 2 days later I come into her office again because I wanted to get out of Math but I told her it was for a headache I had. I asked her if I could just go and lie down for a bit and she told me I could. She comes out to me after about 10 minutes and tells me to roll up my sleeve again. She holds and examines it for a little before she goes and gets a new band-aid for me. She says \"It looks like its healing up nicely\" and gives me this encouraging smile like she can see right through me and its given me this odd comforting feeling about the fact that she knows or may know about my self harming habits. Like the fact that I don't have to say it out loud for her to understand whats going on. Also I have this really big and prominent surgery scar on my ankle for surgeries and she told me \"That is a really pretty scar\" and it made me wanna cry because everyone who sees it has called it \"ugly\" or \"hard to look at\" and it just so happened to be a rare day when didn't wear longer socks or high tops.

We were assigned a task to complete in pairs and the only option for me was to work with someone I've recently been in conflict with. But I love him so much, so I was excited. I went over to sit at his desk in the far corner of the room - the one least noticeable by the teacher. He didn't say much to me and I didn't say much to him. It was heartbreaking knowing all I wanted to do was hug him and tell him I miss him and ask about his sister and his grandma, but I couldn't. So I didn't.\n\nHalf an hour in and everything's going alright. I hadn't slept in 3 days so my eyes were burning and it took every ounce of energy I had just to stay awake. I began to daydream - as one does - staring aimlessly out the window. But he gently shook me out of it: we only had 20 minutes left and we were barely halfway through. I nodded and placed my hands back on my keyboard.\n\nExcept this time, they weren't my hands. Well, obviously they were mine: the same dry skin peeling and cracking at the cuticles; the same rings worn everyday, one on the left ring finger and one on the right middle; the same nails chewed down to tiny stubs; and the same scar on the left thumb from a burn years ago. They were my hands. But they felt like everything but my own.\n\nI began turning them over in front of me, examining them, telling myself in my head: 'These are yours. They've always been yours.' I let my fingertips touch each other, made my palms meet, clasped them together, and ran them up and down my arms. But if anything, I began dissociating more severely. These hands became unrecognizable. Not only were they no longer mine, but I had never even seen them before.\n\nI hadn't realized I'd begun crying till I noticed tear splashes on my sweater. I tried digging my nails into my palms, but they were too short. I wanted to cut my hands; to take a blade and hack at my palms and my fingers. I knew that feeling that pain would prompt my consciousness awake. My friend noticed me and asked what was wrong but, being the only one in my life who knows of my tendency to dissociate, I didn't have to say much to help him understand how I was feeling. He threw his sweater over my hands, removing them from my vision.\n\nSuddenly my mind became clear again. I was shaking. I knew this because his sweater on my lap was shaking as well. He began hugging me, rubbing my back and smoothing out my hair, telling me it would all be okay. I wanted to hug him back or say something in return, but I couldn't find the strength. Its a miracle our teacher never noticed but honestly maybe she did; it was all the same to me. That night, I cut for the first time in 2 years.\n\nSince then, I've dissociated a few additional times - but only once at that severity. These times, there was no one to shake me awake, no one to hide my hands, no one to lead me away from a mirror as I scratched at my own skin trying to persuade myself that the person staring back was, in fact, me.\n\n....\n\nTL;DR : I dissociate, makes me want to self-harm.\n\nI don't really know where I was going with this post. I've experienced dissociation my entire life and honestly, its more common for me to feel detached and 'observant' of my body than it is for me to view the world through my own eyes. This is just one of the times its become an inhibitor to my regular activities. I'm sure it was probably triggered by sleep deprivation and emotional stress (the main reason I provided context about my friend). As far as I know, I haven't met anyone I know who can relate to what I experience on a constant level, so I guess I just wanted to know if anyone on here can? Is this normal? Am I making a big deal out of this whole thing ? Please share your thoughts, I feel so alone in this &lt;3", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I have lost my way, but by admitting it I wish to find myself again. \n\nI don't really have anyone to look up to.

I was lonely. Not a wolf, just lonely. I still am. \n\nI saw the good in people and I was optimistic. However, I despised my parents. They have always taken good care of me, that is something I cannot deny. \n\nThey weren't fitting role models to me, and rather than following their path, I wanted to avoid it. I felt misunderstood and they questioned my beliefs, eventually making me question myself. That is when I got lost. \n\nI feel like I'm being ungrateful. I feel like I blame them for nothing. My feelings are in contradiction. \n\nJust recently I have opened up a little bit to two guys I spend time with at school.

They have never really been alone, but I am sure they have been lonely like I have.\n\nEmotions don't make us weak, they make us humans. Without them life is... being alive but never really living. I've been numb, I've been empty. I never want to be that way again, even if it means me being in pain.\n\nSometimes it's hard to find a reason to stick around.

I don't know how much they would bleed, or how long it would take to stop. I don't want to cut deep but I don't know what I might do in the moment when I get worked up because if I can't get the entire thing out I might keep digging until I think it's all gone.\n\nI think I would buy some antibiotic ointment to put into the wound after squeezing it out. I'm not a hemophiliac so I think it should scab over, but I'm not sure what kind of blood supply moles might have or how long that would take to staunch. It is skin after all, but the diameter of these things is all less than half a centimere (&gt;5mm) and I imagine a lot of people who cut end up doing longer lengths than that.\n\nI guess my concern is that I don't think I would limit myself to a single line, but rather to cut the circumference of these things and scoop downward. Or maybe I could do a single plane if I pinched the skin outward and just cut across the bottom, like felling a tree...\n\nThe mole on the back of my neck and the ones on my inner thighs are the worst and most tempting to go crazy and hack off, but also I realize the most dangerous, which is part of why I rationalize to myself that going after the smaller torso ones first could minimize danger. But I should still have a plan to avoid blood loss and infection afterwards so I don't faint or get sick.\n\nI had a tetanus shot a couple years ago I don't think it matters if my exacto has some rust on it, probably less dangerous than using a kitchen knife and slipping and impaling myself. These are too small to do with nail clippers and serrated knives just look like they'd be too painful and leave jagged wounds. I believe I will eventually give in and use anything at hand though, so if it seems inevitable I want to make a smart choice.\n\nMaybe that should just be working to pay a dermatologist, but the idea just makes me so angry, when I know it's a legitimate health problem I have no control over while people with health problems they CAN control through lifestyle changes still get free treatment... it's like I'm angry to think about doing it on principal and figure I should be my own free treatment.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I am writing this mostly for myself but if someone reads it and it helps them, all the better. \nI am 20 years old and have been self harming since I was 13. My whole life I have suffered with mental health issues I inherited from my father and it is difficult a lot of the time for me. I know what its like to be young and turn to harming yourself as a way to cope/distract yourself/feel something. \nIf you are self harming something is wrong. Doesn\u2019t matter how deep or if you\u2019re planning a suicide note or how old or young, if you\u2019re hurting yourself something is deeply wrong. I\u2019m going to be honest, holding icecubes and rubber bands on ur wrists probably won\u2019t do shit all to stop. Something is wrong with your life or with your mental health and self harm will not help you (you know this already though, don\u2019t you)\nTherapy, psychologists, medications all help. Its not the immediate relief of self harm. Its not euphoric or fun and it probably won\u2019t make you feel good for a while. In fact, its difficult and sometimes upsetting. However, having a good therapist or psychologist or counsellor will help your mental health get more in check. (And remember therapy is a two way street, if you are not honest you will not get the full benefits of the sessions) You might need medication or a short hospital stay or a long one, but if you /need/ it, its something you must do. Recovery from any addiction, and yes, this is an addiction, requires concentration and a steadfast constitution. You will need help from others sometimes, reaching out is a positive thing. You will need courage and stamina and support. \nTrying is the first step. If you relapse within and hour or a minute or a year it\u2019s ok and you can start again and be stronger next time. \nIf anyone needs to talk message me please. If you\u2019re young and just beginning to self injure, tell someone and try to nip it in the bud. It can be a life long affliction and i promise you dealing with your situation now will be easier in the long run. \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95 much love to you all! ", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

The amount of times I have self harmed in the 4 years we have been together doesn\u2019t even come close to a month in high school. I didn\u2019t grow out of it. I just rarely had a reason to do it. He barely responded to me in tech school. I know he was busy studying but I only wanted I love you and good night texts every day. In another training that he couldn\u2019t use his phone for I would send him daily texts to make myself feel okay. It kept me happy knowing he was constantly getting I love you texts. I think about him constantly. I probably looked pathetic but he is the only person I\u2019ve truly loved and the only person I trust. If you were in my position you\u2019d smother him in texts too. Did I mention I think he dumped me because of a sudden decline in health that I couldn\u2019t control? All I want to do is hurt myself but the only reason I haven\u2019t is because of him. I still have ALL of my blades. I want to prove to him I can do it. I want to prove to him that I can handle whatever the air force throws at us. Even if it\u2019s long deployments. Because I can. Did I mention I have tried medication to get rid of my anxiety and depression throughout our relationship? I was so depressed when he was in basic I started taking meds and went crazy on them. They made me so much worse. He got a lot of depressing letters in basic because the meds made me manic with severe depression, as if my depression wasn\u2019t bad enough before. I\u2019m in so much physical and mental pain. I don\u2019t get enough therapy appointments because of my health care system. I couldn\u2019t get a grip on a healthy lifestyle like he could  so I couldn\u2019t lose weight. I don\u2019t know what to do but I don\u2019t want to be depressed or hurt myself anymore so he will want to be with me. I\u2019m tired of being miserable to be around or talk to and I\u2019m tired of wanting to slit my wrists in a ditch to bleed out and die I\u2019m tired of this life and I don\u2019t know how to make it stop. I WANT IT ALL TO STOP. I want to be happy and healthy and feel safe. I want to be able to do this with and without him. I want the pain to stop. I want the pain he is accidentally causing to stop. I want the pain of things before him to stop. I want the pain and lack of safety I feel driving to my best friends house because my rapist lives on her street to stop. I want the pain from my ex best friend\u2019s physical, mental, and sexual abuse for 11 years to stop. I want the pain of never being good enough for anything to stop. But it\u2019s not stopping and it\u2019s not getting better. I feel so alone and isolated. All I asked for was an I love you text once a day. I\u2019m 5 months self harm free and It\u2019s almost a year since my suicide attempt. I have too many wants and needs because now I just want the thoughts telling me I\u2019m not important enough and that I should have jumped a year ago to stop. It probably won\u2019t stop.

The fear in his eyes scarred me for months. I was worried about my brother and thought maybe something bad had happened to him. When I got the call and went down to the counselor's office and saw what I was walking into, anger instantly filled my entire body and I knew what was going on. I pulled the \u201cI have no idea what you were talking about\u201d but it didn\u2019t work. They said I needed to go to the hospital and there was no other choice. The scars on my wrist both proved that statement wrong, and right. There was another option. I could leave school and go back home and finally finish what I started or I could go get the so called \u201chelp\u201d that I had been begging to get from people that never truly noticed or didn\u2019t care enough to do so. As I sat emotionless in that car I realized how much my choices affected other people. I looked over and saw my dad crying in the driver's seat. Not because of embarrassment but fear, not for himself but me. I never have been emotionally close with my father and probably still never will. So the few people that I do talk to about my problems, they don\u2019t get bits and pieces. They get the whole fireball thats brewing inside of me waiting to just be thrown out onto somebody else. But that\u2019s not what I want. I don\u2019t want to be somebody else's problem. I don\u2019t want to be a constant worry for someone so I\u2019d rather just push them away and let me deal with my own problems even if it boils down to me making my own fate of a rope around my neck. But it\u2019s just that about opening up to people that scares me. They can be your solitude for a day, week, month, maybe even years but it all comes down to everybody leaves at some point even if they say they never will, they always do. This same thought could be the one that saves me or ends me due to my shattered childhood.\nIt\u2019s crazy how much your actions can affect other people. But that to me is the problem. Everytime I open my mouth I feel like I\u2019m hurting someone or I\u2019m burning down myself just to keep myself from hurting other people. My actions the day of the hospital only hurt the people I wanted to be happy and didn\u2019t matter to the person who I thought it would matter to the most. My own mother, the person who developed me inside of her and gave birth to me. She didn\u2019t care that I was there with the intent to kill myself just hours before getting to school that day. She didn\u2019t come to see me, or see how I was doing. The only reason she was there was because she had been forced to be by the police. Not even for me but for herself. That killed me and took every ounce of happiness that there was left in me and crush it like a empty pop can. I sat in that car getting texts from people asking where I was. And the people that did know where I was, I was angry at. They couldn\u2019t keep one secret and just let natural selection do it\u2019s thing and kill off the weak. After that I through my mask back on and put on what everyone wanted. \u201cThat pretty little smile\u201d that she says she made. She may have made it but she also took that away and chipped at it to make it never work again. My ability to be happy.\nSince then I have felt like a car without gas just rolling as the road goes without having enough energy to care about what happens. I\u2019ve lost the urge to even open my eyes in the morning and every day I wake up disappointed by what I have become. A leaf in a river just floating by until I reach the lake of life which will probably just pull me deep down into its depths like my emotions do to happiness. But it doesn\u2019t make sense, you\u2019d think that by how much I don\u2019t care I\u2019d just keep floating and just go with the emptiness of my self. Everyday I wake up and just go day by day slowly letting my mind get swallowed in the storm of thoughts in my head like a sinkhole that started as a small crack in the road.\nThe storm only seems to get bigger and bigger as I carry on with my life and I have finally started to understand that I was doomed from the start and that once the cracks get big enough there is nothing you can do besides just let it shatter and deal with the consequences after even if that consequence is becoming just a pigment of an imagination or memory, only able to be seen in the back of somebody\u2019s mind or in a picture that will forever be fading like the thought of me in the people who once cared about me. I can not be fixed and will always be a shattered broken kid with a shattered smile. I am broken\n", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

So 2 nights ago I was having a rough night and misjudged my actions. I had to get some \u2018liquid stitches\u2019, which I\u2019m pretty certain was just surgical glue and then steristrips on top. I put a tegaderm (waterproof) dressing with no pad in the centre of it over top (dumb idea looking back). When I showered today I was reacting to the adhesive, which is normal for me, but I wanted to take it off and put a new one on so it would stay clean and fresh. Anyways, I tried to slowly pull off the tegaderm but it pulled one of the steristrips off no matter how slowly I did it. The glue appears to have come off and I re-opened the injury in the process. I put on new steristrips to the best of my ability, put on the proper tegaderm padded dressing, and cleaned up but I\u2019m worried that I screwed up by messing up the liquid stitching. \n\nI left town so I can\u2019t go to the hospital/doctor to get it fixed for another 3/4 days. It\u2019s definitely open again and I\u2019m freaking out cause I was already beating myself up about it and needing to get help but I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve tried googling things but there isn\u2019t much online that I can find. Are just the steristrips fine? It\u2019s clean, so I\u2019m not worried about infection, I just need to keep it that way. the other glued parts are fine it was just that one that I messed up. I\u2019m so embarrassed, I don\u2019t want to go back to the doctor/hospital (plus I\u2019m certain they\u2019d think I did it myself again and admit me, which wasn\u2019t the case), so if I can avoid that or if anyone has any suggestions please let me know. :( \n\nI\u2019m not asking for expert medical advice just if anyone\u2019s been in a similar position and how they fixed it.

Rarely any conversation. \n\nAfter two weeks I was placed in the Adolescent Psychiatry Unit. \nWas pretty much a groom home for depressed teenagers. 8 rooms, 2 of them with cameras.

I became extremely reckless and my personality changed pretty much all together. In my case I got so used to being secluded and constantly discussing mental health that I had a hard time returning back into society. \nThis happened to majority of the people I was with in the APU. \n\nI\u2019m not going to say that being hospitalized like this is a bad thing, because for some people it\u2019s what they really need. But before you go make sure you are given the amount of time, and what you should expect from it, and then from there make your decision.

All was going well until the last stitch, I thought I went deep enough to get underneath scar tissue, but I couldn't get the eye of the needle through the entrance point for awhile, and right before I did it started bleeding (none of the others bled, they just oozed clear liquid). Then once it went all the way through the exit point both started bleeding, it was a lot of blood considering these are just tiny holes. It's mostly stopped now, it was only bleeding for a few minutes. Did I just puncture scar tissue or is this something more serious? Should I be concerned? \n\nEdit: trying to tie it off and it started bleeding again. Smth to do with pulling on the thread... \n\nEdit 2: got it tied off, and it stopped bleeding. I think it's okay for now but any advice would be appreciated \n\nEdit 3 (last one I swear): I didn't think to mention it at the time, but that stitch was also much more painful... Not that I minded much, but even now the others dont hurt at all, and that one still does. Thinking scar tissue is likely the reason, but still not sure and that makes me a little nervous. I would take it out, but I did them in a way where they're connected, so to take out one they all have to come out, and I don't really want to ruin my work. Not sure it would make much of a difference either, if I did any damage it's not going to fix that, it's not bleeding anymore and the pain is much less. So I'm probably gonna keep them in for a few days and admire the product of my fucked up masochistic urges. ", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

To me that screams reliance but part of me is like \"Addiction? No. Can't be. You can't be addicted to something. Simply impossible.\"\n\nIt also seems like it's affecting my memory.  It honestly seems kinda bizarre that for about 19 years I didn't feel like this and that for 20 I had never self harmed.  The happy memories seem like a fake facade and the boring memories memories have become evidence that I've always been a dumbass outcast that no one wanted to spend time with.\n\nIn addition to all that it's so hard to open up about it because despite the fact that none of my friends know I cut and that I try to hide my depression, I'm always worried about being some fake attention seeking cunt. Like wtf brain pick a side.\n\nAnyway thanks for reading and responding. ", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

But no one ever sees those because I always wear long sleeves or bracelets etc. \n\nAlso considering I have had a couple very stressful weeks, it's kind of a likely assumption to think I was cutting. And on the day my mom must have seen she was close to tears a couple times, but didn't say anything about it. I just can't stand her crying, it just feels so overbearing it makes me feel sick/nauseous. And I know that it this makes me sound like a dick, but I have no empathy for her crying about me. And I\u2019m pretty sure if she does believe I cut she's gonna talk about it to family members and/or her best friend. I dont want her to talk about it, but to tell her _that_, I'd have to admit to her I cut before I ask her to keep my secret, and that would \"deepen\" our \"trust\" and the idea of that just makes me wanna puke. I don\u2019t think any of my family members would directly confront me about it, but I could be wrong. (I'm in my 20s and live by myself btw)\n\nOn the other hand it is also possible that she was close to crying because it was a very important, stressful day that in a way would decide about my future, so she noticed how tense I was, and she was probably also afraid that I would get negative response in the up coming conference that afternoon. \n\n**So anyway, the question is how do I make her believe that I'm not cutting/have never cut?**\n\n**My first idea** was I could go up to her, maybe say that that scalpel probably make it look like I cut and then explain to her that I just use it to pick at my skin, but I always hide it, because I feel embarrassed about my picking habit. But I feel like approaching her this directly would make it seem like I'm lying, and draw her attention to the fact that I'm trying to convince her I'm not cutting, and then she'd probably think I talked like that to her because I'm actually cutting. (sry for the awkward phrasing, hope it still makes sense)\n\n\n**And my second idea** is to just leave some hydrocolloid bandages laying around next to the scalpel in the bathroom (I use hydrocolloid bandages to cover up pimples when I'm home alone). I also use the scalpel to cut little square pieces off the hydrocolloid bandages in order to stick them on my skin/spots, so that don't pick at them. Meanwhile I would also just leave some hydrocolloid stickers on my face and when she comes visit, she'll probably ask \"what's that in your face?\" and I could casually explain that I use this to keep myself from picking at my skin, but I usually always take those stickers off before she visits because it looks weird and I feel embarrassed about my skin picking habit. This way I would give her an alternative explanation for the scalpel laying in may bathroom, hopefully without letting on that I realize she probably thinks I cut. \n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

{"post_id": "babung", "created_utc": 1554604024, "title": "I Think I'm Addicted to Cutting", "author": "Miserable_Ant", "self_text": "So, I've been cutting for only about a month and a half now and the first few weeks of that were with knives and it is hard to do much with a knife unless you sharpen it.\n\nAbout half a year ago, I was thinking of opening my arteries so I wanted to test the sharpness of the knives I could use. To my surprise, skin is deceptively tough and it's actually pretty hard to even just draw blood with regular kitchen knives (or at least the ones I had). So these knives would basically just draw a shallow line in my skin and, if I pushed hard enough, maybe draw those little beads of blood. So obviously I wasn't going to reach any major arteries with these unless I really tried but I thought I would just end up making myself look like a fool. I kept making those really shallow cuts for a few months because that was all I had. \n\nIn February I turned eighteen and bought myself some pocket knives. Not to cut myself with, just because I'm kind of interested in knives and I think they are handy tools to have. Anyway, I found myself in the same scenario but these knives were sharper and could actually cut at least a little bit.\n\nAfter covering my shoulders in these pathetic little cuts, that barely bled, I decided it was time to buy some actual blades. So I bought some double edged razors and a half bottle of Russian Standard. I know that to some people a half bottle might not be that much but, like I said, I had just recently turned eighteen so I didn't drink much. So, I chugged the lot all in one and it was enough to get me well and truly pished. I'll admit that the first few cuts weren't the deepest because, whether you are Rambo or not, it hurts to dig a razor in to your own skin (even when you are drunk). Once I got the balls to push it a little deeper though, I loved it. I don't mean to sound twisted but watching the razor effortlessly glide through my skin, seeing the skin part, watching the gap fill with blood, and watching the blood run down my shoulder or thigh was so satisfying for reasons unknown to me. I just kept doing it for a couple hours until I and everything around me was covered in blood. Because I was drunk I was just stumbling around my bedroom, which resulted in my room looking like a murder scene.  I wasn't trying to kill myself but when I started to sober up and realised how much blood there was I honestly thought that I might die. The cuts weren't the deepest but each one had 2 or 3 points where blood would run out of and there where 50-70 cuts so it added up. Anyway, I obviously didn't die but I've done it a few more times and each time I do it, I tell myself 'never again' but I always find myself thinking about it.\n\nWhen I look at myself in the mirror and see hundreds of lined scabs and scars or when I bleed in the shower or when it hurts to walk because my legs are covered in cuts, I do regret it but I can't stop wanting to do it more.\n\nI've been to professionals and they have given me a few possible explanations of why I do it. Perhaps, I am testing myself. Maybe I am trying to get relief. But I honestly don't know. All I know is that it is almost like an addiction and I love it.\n\nAnyway, I'll wrap it up here. Sorry for the long post. I'm not looking for pity or sympathy, I just wanted to get that off my chest. I appreciate anyone who took the time to read it and sorry for the terrible grammar.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Eventually, I reached a full year in between relapses. My relapses were also very insignificant, being only \u201ccat scratches\u201d compared to my normal of hitting fat/muscle.\n\nHowever, recently I have slid backwards in a way I don\u2019t fully understand. I have been removed from treatment for about five years now, but I still have occasional contact with my counselor. I am in a very stressful place in my life, seeing as I am in university and living alone, and have begun to start relying on self harm again. \n\nThe self-harm, however, is not functional in the way it used to be - I WAS cutting for relief and a release of internal pressures. Now, the cutting is more of a hobby. I am cutting just to see blood/fat, to feel pain, and to make scars. I am also seeing how deep I can go without needing stitches. I genuinely do not feel depressed and can not pinpoint why I\u2019m cutting because I am not doing it when I am in distress, I\u2019m just bored or curious. \n\nHas anyone else had this experience? It sounds silly, but I\u2019m worried my cutting has evolved into a hobby - rather than a coping mechanism - that will eventually accidentally be taken too far. ", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I tried to distract or ignore it (didn\u2019t work), tried \u201chealthy alternatives\u201d like rubber bands or writing on my arms (didn\u2019t work very long) and eventually I was just worn down. I stopped caring if I did cut or not and gathered up the items slowly. That little voice telling me to not do it shut up too. I did it, small shallow cuts under a quarter of an inch. Enough to draw a bit of blood to the surface. I didn\u2019t feel bad or guilty while doing it or after and I actually just laughed about it. I did it a few more times and the relief it gave me from dysphoria, depression and anxiety was pretty enjoyable. Felt bad to see my scars go. Most recently was like 4 days ago or more, I cut and didn\u2019t feel that usual wash of relief. Figured I was doing it too frequently and I got used to it.

Then during the May is previous year I started to cut deeper and focused primarily on thighs, fingers and wrists. I was overall pretty messed up then, drinking, punching and choking myself with belt several times. Everything stopped when I've cut my forearm and during weekend visit to parents they've noticed the cuts.\n\nAfter this incident I decided to be clean and was like this until autumn when I started with small not deep cuts again, as well as bruising knuckles, punching myself and so on. But it was again not consistent and I've eventually stopped.\n\nThen some small relapses happened, but right now I feel like I'm going to go serious again. So the question is - maybe there is some advice you have to prevent this? Simple distractions like YouTube or else don't seem to work, just as I'm starting to lose interest in them again.\n\nJust to mention, I'm not officially diagnosed with depression or any other mental illness because I haven't visited therapist since I was 11 and had some serious problems. So I cannot say that this urges come from some mental issue or whatsoever.\n\nTL;DR Help, my stupid ass wants to relapse again.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Nothing good will come from that. Well anyway, I lied to my parents, and told them I only did it once, which is quite far from the truth. Luckily, my friend only knew that I cut on my hips, and I only cut where undergarments cover, so my parents didn't see anything there. No one knew about anywhere else, so that's good.

Even if I were, that wouldn't make it any less valid. When they say someone is doing it for attention, they mean that they're silently asking for help. They want someone to ask if they're okay and encourage them to seek help, not oogle at their cuts and scars. \n\n2) It's not teenage hormones; It's depression. Even if it were hormones, why would that negate any reason to seek help? \n\n3) Please do not point them out unless you know me. If you do know me, please dont treat me like I'm crazy or act disgusted. That won't help anyone.\n\n4) Also, don't point them out loudly or in public. Even if I'm wearing a t-shirt with my wrists slashed to ribbons, I definitely do not want you to broadcast or shine a light on my issues in front of others. Keep your thoughts to yourselves.\n\n5) No, self harm is not exclusively done by teenagers. Adults self harm, and that is 1,000% valid. Don't demean me for never learning any healthy coping mechanisms when I never had the chance.\n\n6) I know it hurts to hear this, but even if you mean a lot to me, you don't have the power to change me in a week. One conversation won't help. This does NOT mean I love you any less, or that you are any less important to me. Self harm is just so hard to deal with on so many levels. It can take years to stop. Please be patient with me.\n\n7) Positive reinforcement goes a lot further than negative reinforcement. You could threaten to leave me or take stuff away, and I'd still find myself with new cuts that very night. However, when you praise me for a week, a month, a year clean? It makes me feel like I can do it.\n\n8) Please don't play mind games with me. Don't guilt trip me. Don't tell me, \"How would you feel if I did that!?\" It will only make me feel worse and more likely to cut. I can't believe anyone would think that this would make me stop. (Please refer to point 6 if you still don't understand.)\n\n9) Self harmers are desperate. If you take away my blades, I'll use my nails. If you start to check my body, I'll cut beneath my bra and under my feet so you won't see. If you threaten me in any way, I will still cut. Don't think for one moment that this physical addiction is anything that can be stopped at the drop of a hat.\n\n10) \"Have you tried coloring? Happy music? Talking to someone? Maybe watching a funny show? Maybe marking your skin with a red pen?\" Okay, let's get one thing straight: self harm gives you tunnel vision. It often feels like my only option, and sometimes my depression is so severe that nothing in that moment makes me feel happy. Don't give me generic alternatives you know will only delay the inevitable. Being a self harmer takes strength on my part to quit, but giving half-assed suggestions is not going to help me. I find that talking with someone helps a lot more than \"happy music.\"\n\nThese are just some things that have weighed on me for the past few years. If anyone has any more points, feel free to add them to my list!\n\nEdit: Holy shit, thanks for all the positive feedback and platinum/gold/silver!!! To anyone wondering if you can share this... please do. Go crazy with it. Send it to your loved ones who don't quite get it yet. Send it to a fellow self harmer who needs help explaining what it's like to their judgemental parents/friends. Post it on other platforms so more people can be exposed to it. I spent three days trying so hard to articulate what's been swimming in my head for years, and I hope this effort helps you all to spread what really helps a self harmer and what is detrimental to them.

The trolls and the ignorant know-it-alls, the immaturity... my husband and I did it together, deleted FB and Insta and reddit and have been focussing on living in the real world. Playing video games and watching movies, working out together, exploring our city. It's been really good, for both of us. I was feeling so much more settled...\n\nBUT...\n\nI'm severely bipolar, and like clockwork a couple of weeks ago I had a major depressive episode, all the uncontrollable anger and frustration reared it's ugly head, the sadness and the fear that I'm 34 and I am between careers and I have no fucking clue when I'll be succesful again... and then while my husband was out for a few hours fishing one night, I downed a bottle of wine, a small handful of each of my many pharmaceuticals (not with suicidal intent, I just wanted to get fucked up and delirious), and I retrieved one of my secret blades. Proper surgical scalpels; maximum damage. \n\nAnyhoo, I don't remember much but when I DID come to they had a crash cart on standby as my heart rate was 26- 31bpm (took way too many beta blockers), I was still warm and fuzzy and high as a kite from the other drugs I had taken, and I had three gaping wounds in my thighs and one in the middle of my chest. Two parallel on the left, one huge T-shape on the right, and what looks like an incision from some sort of heart surgery now. 87 + 14 stitches, once my heart rate finally stabilised after about 12 hours. Including some internally because I cut so deep (about an inch) that mounds of yellow fat were being forced up out of the wounds. \n\nAnyway. I guess the point is I fucked up. And now I'm disappointed and mad at myself because I have ALWAYS cut or burned my arms and at 34, I am STILL escalating my self harm behaviour each time it happens. My last PB for stitches was 40-something. Now I have 101. Before that it was 20-something. The need to cut deeper, wider, more severely is like some fucked up competition my messed up mind plays with itself. What's next? I've fantasised about the theatre of slicing my throat when I've been manic; how do I know I won't do something like that? How do I know that next time I won't KILL myself by accident? Hit an artery? My husband came home from fishing early when he couldn't reach me on the phone. What if I go back to cuttinng in my car and nobody knows where I am, bleeding out?\n\nI don't know the point of this expulsion of feelings except to say I just maybe need to tell it to someone who will UNDERSTAND. Not just feel bad for me, with me, but someone  who knows the fear, the lack of control, the demented satisfaction of seeing the damage we cause ourselves, and the crippling guilt that comes after.  I feel such a mess again. I hate what I've done and yet I still can't shake this almost PROUD feeling; look what I'm capable of doing to myself. Look at my pain tolerance, look at my PAIN. \n\nBut there IS no cure. So I'm doomed to repeat this cycle until I die. What the fuck kind of life is this?", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I ''started'' having depression when i was like 15 years old, maybe even younger (I acknowledged that i had depression at that age tho). Missing parents in house, abusive dad used to beat the shit out of me with school stuff. I remember on primary school HATING weekends cuz that's when my dad made me grab my backpack and i had to take out all of the folders with the shit i've been doing in the course of the weekend. \u00bfSpelling mistakes? Get yelled at for being a failure. \u00bfA broken sheet of paper? Get yelled at or even slaped because of being disorganized and well, not caring about my school stuff. Fun fact not so fun fact: My mother and my brothers never stood up for me and said they dont remember any of that stuff happen, but i remember them not giving two fucks about it.\n\nSo yeah, weekends as a kid where like ugh, i can't even describe it tbh, just something horrible, my freaking heart would go crazy when i heared him say my name, just that took to make me go crazy.\n\nSo yeah, i said i have brothers. Well they aren't really brothers as in full blood brothers, they are step brothers, 8 to be precise. 4 Step brothers and 4 step sisters, they never gave a fuck about me. They really gave 0 (zero) fucks to me, nor they acknowledged me as a brother (At least from my father side of step brothers n sis), my mom even told me one of my sisters sent my father a letter that said how's the bastard child. FUCKING BASTARD CHILD.\n\nSo yeah, home hasn't been a... home, never. Not that i remember tbh, Shit in school wasn't good either, i've always been a stout kid (A lil bit fat ain't gonna lie) when i was younger, and reaaaaally sensitive. Like really fucking sensitive, another reason to laugh at me, when i failed at something i started to cry, and beg to not tell my parents that cuz i knew what home was like.\n\nShit hit the fan when i tried to kill myself in the school, a teacher caught me redhanded (No pun intended) on the bathroom and they called my parents and well you know the drill, if you don't, got to meet with a psychologist, yadda yadda.\n\nWent to her till i ended with primary school, parents thought i was fine and i did too.\n\nThat's when High School came in, and shit hit the fan again, classmates started to bully me cuz well i became a brony, i just watched the show with my niece and really liked it. That was on 2nd year of High School, 1st year was normal shit that happens everyday.\n\nAfter telling that to the one guy i thought was my friend, the rumour spread across the fucking school, despite i never really carried anything pony related and shit, they started to pick on me and say horrible stuff that i have locked away in the darkest corner of my brain. That's when i started to cut myself.\n\nI don't know how to describe how freaking good it felt to do it, like really. It was such a pain killer, it was like being in heaven (Sry if it sounds fucked up but it really felt good) still have some scars on my wrist and the ones in my legs are thankfully covered in hair. But the wrists ones i still carry em as ''war scars'' (Ik it sounds stupid but that's how i called em), back to the topic, i really became WAY more shy and sensitive i ever was. I'm also a really introverted person but that just made it go like x200 more.\n\nLong story short, i got caught in maths class, after teacher saw i was bleeding on my shirt. And well i didnt heal my scars (Stupid me ik) so they where infected.  (Another fun fact no so fun fact is that my classmates knew i cutted myself, i even tried to talk with my preceptor about the bullying but she didn't give two fucks about it either)\n\nAfter that, class was ended early and i just went with my teacher (Which i really love her, such a sweet old lady, never talked back to her tho idk if she's even alive tbh) to the principals office and waited for my parents there.\n\nI left school, for about two years or so. Went all days to a psychologist and a psychiatrist, got medicated and stayed 24/7 locked up in my room on my house.\n\nHad some crazy episodes i started to scream and shit like that, so i also ended on a clinic for 2 weeks, worst experience on my fucking life. It was a psychiatric clinic (Hope that's how it's written in english) there where not only mental patients there, addicts too. I even remember the familiars of the people giving them cigarrettes to them so they forgot about the drugs they consumed (ikr wtf).\n\nForgot to say i went to church in between all this shit, i really believed in that, can't say i do now, but church helped a bit i guess.\n\nSo yeah, i got missdiagnosed for a mental disease i didn't have. My psychologist didn't even tell me what she talked with my psychiatrist cuz it was really fucked up and i didn't want to know tbh why i had been miss diagnosed and had to chug THAT many fucking pills.\n\nThe pills, those fucking pills made me a zombie, i slept 18/7, didnt move from my fucking bed, when the dose went down i started to do minimal stuff but still that really fucked me up. I gained weight, a lot indeed. Still not able to lose it, but that's going for later.\n\nAfter the two years recovery i went back to school, 2016, third grade High school having 17 years i felt like a complete failure, ain't gonna lie. I still do, like i'm 19 (almost 20) and i'm at the last year of highschool.\n\nThings went.. good i guess. In 2017 or 2018 (dont remember that well) i stopped chugging the anti depressives they gave me but i still felt like shit, stopped going to the psychologist, and things went downhill again. Had some problems with one of my best friends, that ended me on being used by her to acomplish some sick stuff but i dont really want to talk about that.\n\nYears 2017, i met a girl. Thru a group from whatsapp called Enfermitos Por el Warcraft sad i know, knowing a girl thru whatsapp idk. I didn't give two fucks about her at first, tbh i never really gave two fucks about girls on my life, people even thought, damn even one of my friends last year thought i was gay because of how i am and i dont talk about girls (Stupid ik but idk stupid people is stupid i guess, ofc that made me feel like shit, thinking girls saw me as a gay guy ugh, nothing against gay people but i really dont like being mistaken for one) so yeah, things went good i guess. I talked with her a lot, and after a year or a couple o' months we started to go deeper on our stuff. Like, more personal stuff talks and shit like that, ain't gonna lie. I started to understand her shit and she understood mine. I've always been a good listener but never had anyone listen to me as i did.\n\nShe.. idk man, she really understood me. And at one point we both clicked and decided to see eachother irl. That was on 2018 near June, yeah on june. We started \u00bfDating? Idk i think i should call it like that. And we went on a some kind of weird relationship. We were really close to eachother, i did stuff i never did with anyone with her and felt i bonded with her. I even loved her, damn, i really sound stupid or at least feel stupid typing this. I started to visit her more often it was a fucking 50km trip from my house to hers, but i didn't give a fuck i felt great, she did too we both did good. But then, the open relationship shit came, and i felt like crap.\n\n\u00bfWasn't i enough for her?\n\n\u00bfAm i really that disgusting that she needs to be with others to stay with me?\n\nIdk, that's what my stupid fucking mind told me all the time.\n\nI stayed with her until i couldn't handle it anymore and decided to break up with her. I'ts been 3 months since that, i stopped doing exercise, been getting fatter. Can't even look at myself anymore dude, it's horrible i'ts really freaking horrible. School is getting heavy, can't look at myself, considered to start cutting myself again. I don't get out of my house that much, i'm isolating myself again. Closing myself.\n\nI never posted on reddit, but i've been here for a long time and decided to just throw this shit out of me.\n\nSo yeah, that. I don't have the courage to go outside and do exercise, can't look at myself. I eat like a pig, like really, like a fucking pig with my anxiety. It's horrible seeing how my body is transforming like that.\n\nI miss my true me. But i don't remember him either, i just feel hollow.\n\nSo yeah, that's my story.\n\nEdit: Typos.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

So a little bit ago my mom found out I self harm after she believed id stopped after 8th grade (I'm in 9th but have been doing it sense 6th) but i was in the car with my mother when I started talking about counseling and how i didn't like it, and how i kinda wanted to see a psychiatrist so i can get a diagnoses. Mostly so i can prove to her that I'm actually struggling and that it's actually serious. But no, my mom said if i go then it will follow me for the rest of my life and everything like that and just started talking about how I'm a teenager and everyone goes through shit like this, blah blah. It just made me so angry that she cant see how much pain her daughter is in and how she is the main reason. I live in a broken family where I'm yelled at all the time. everything is so shitty and my depression is at an all time low. I literally am only living for ONE single person, because idk what she would do if i wasn't there. I'm living for other people, not myself.  There is a part of me who wants to get better, but idk if that will ever happen. I want my mom and others to understand that i am not lying and that theres a serious problem. But no  im a teenager so nothing is real, and if i vent and cry and blame my mother, she says it's all me and that i need to get better myself.\n\nEdit: ok this has so many upvotes?? ialsksksns idk why ppl care    Also there is a lot more to this, it\u2019s not just me being mad bc my mom says I\u2019m a teenager", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Six whole years. It might have been even longer, I just know that it was at least that long because I met a celebrity in 2012 who was actually a big reason why I stopped. And I know I stopped before I met them. Anyway, I've been wanting to do it again off and on for the past few weeks and I just feel like I've completely thrown recovery away. I thought I was over this coping method. I thought I was finally free and safe. Of course, I had urges within those six years but I was able to handle it. The thing is, I kind of knew this was coming. Leading up to my relapse, I had often been thinking of ways to break one of the cheap razors that I have so I can hurt myself. And I probably could have stopped myself if I got rid of anything that I could use or at least told someone. But of course, I didn't and now here I am on Reddit trying to distract myself from relapsing all over again. I just feel like I'll never get to six years again.

She argude that since I can't smoke inside where I live I atleast get some fresh air and a bit of a walk if I smoke. Im more on the side that cutting is dageruos for me (physsically) only a short time, while smoking can cause long term damage inside.  She ofc countered with that my scars cause a lot og emotional damage also because of shame and stuff like that.  \n\nI think it was quite an interesting discussion, so I wanted to hear if any of you had some input on this subject. What do you think: SH or Smoking?", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

(By the way this knowledge might only be useful for people who cut, I've never burned or poisoned myself or anything except scratching and biting which is pretty similar to cutting anyway so)\n\n\nMakeshift Bandage: Dont know how many people already do this, but I just discovered this today so yee\n\n\nThis one is good for if you make a big cut that a couple of Band-Aids ain't gonna cover. So basically all you have to do is find a spare bedsheet, or a shirt that no longer fits, or really any type of thin-ish fabric. Then, use scissors or whatever you used to cut in the first place to cut or tear the fabric to the right length and width. The bandage should be at least a little wider than the wound and slightly long enough to tie around whatever body part the wound is on. I would recommend white or pastel fabric to monitor the blood flow, so that you can avoid an emergency in the case that it won't clot.\n\n\nHiding Razor Blades (or other yeeting paraphernalia): If you live with a guardian, roommate, spouse, etc. and don't want them to see your yeet tools, DO NOT PUT THEM WHERE THEY WOULD LOOK FOR THEM. They could rummage through drawers, purses, bookbags, and god knows what else (trust me, my mom searched my purse today) if they're concerned or even if they need something innocent like a credit card. I try to hide my razors in something (preferrably disposable in case something happens and you need to throw them away inconspicuously) that nobody would think, or want to open. Why does this sound like an infomercial ffs jeez\n\nAnyway, I'd recommend either the wrapper for a pad or maybe a condom (? I don't know, I don't think I've ever actually seen a condom wrapper.......) with the pad or condom still in it, of course, so it won't be thrown away. My personal favorite is emptying out a stick of deodorant, then putting the razors inside. BUT, if you do this, be sure to put it in a plastic bag or something so it doesn't get deodorant on it. I don't know what deodorant does to wounds but I'm sure it's bad.\n\n\n\nAnyway, thank you for reading my wall of text and I hope this helps!", "subreddit": "MadeOfStyrofoam"}

Does being clean really mean anything if i can lose it all in one moment and be back at square one?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I started self harming in 2016 (age 13) and I last self-harmed July 2018 (age 15) I'm now weeks away from turning 16 and I am currently 265 days (almost 9 months) clean and counting with no plans to ever start again. I'm very proud of how far I've come, but the thing is, I didn't plan to start self-harming. I don't think anyone really does. At least in my case, I didn't really even understand it as i did it, and i certainly didn't think i'd still be cutting myself years after the first time. I'm really trying not to waffle on to much,  but what I'm trying to say is that things don't always go to plan. I know first hand what it's like to stay clean for months, and then one bad night, one lingering thought, one day where i just don't really have the motivation to tell my mind no, and all of my progress is gone. I feel like I'm in a really good place right now, 4 months into the year and I haven't harmed myself once, 3 months away from the big 1 year milestone and I can't remember the last time i seriously considered self-harming. If i were naive, I'd consider myself recovered. But I'm not. I'm terrified of slipping up. I'm terrified it will all get too much again and everything I've been working so hard toward will be gone. I'm scared something really bad will happen and I just wont be able to cope. Because what if someone i love dies for example, its a normal part of life, it happens, and a normal person will grieve and eventually get over it. But I'm so scared if something like that happens, I'll just crumble and lose everything I'm fighting for in my pain and I'll just slip up. My last relapse happened after my friend of 10 years said she hated me over text and said we weren't friends anymore; that was such a bad time, i can't even describe it. I see posts about people going years without it and just slipping up one day and losing it all, I see things like \"10 years clean and counting\" and I guess it terrified me that they're still counting, that it's still something they think about. Because i feel like you can't be recovered if you're still counting, still waiting for the day the numbers turn back to zero. I'm terrified that the days between men nothing, that I'm just counting days till i next explode. DAE feel this way? Does being clean really mean anything if i can lose it all in one moment? (I'm sorry this was so long, I ended up ranting a bit I'm just really scared...)", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

My friend found out and he told me something that made me feel good. He asked, \"when ever you feel this way, could you text me first? I know this is probably annoying for you but I love you so much and I don't want to see you like this. What if you accidentally hit a vein and die? That would make me more depressed.\" Honestly, it made me feel wanted. He's really the only person that can make me feel like that. I'm glad he said that and I promised I would tell him. But I feel like that almost every day and I don't want to annoy him. It's not that I won't tell him, I just won't tell him every single time I feel this way.

Basically, I\u2019ve been dealing with a lot of self-doubt, feelings of not being as good as everyone else, and fears of being alone and friendless. I go to this uni where we have a type of rush season - think frat/srat rush but not for Greek life - for these \u201cexclusive\u201d groups. I\u2019ve always been told, though, that there are so many of them so if you\u2019re a normal person, you should be able to get in. It\u2019s been my dream to be in one since my first year...I sooo wanted to do it and I am crushed that after rounds and rounds of interviews, I wasn\u2019t accepted to any of them. I\u2019m super afraid that now I won\u2019t have friends; I do have good friends, but I don\u2019t have that many - and a lot of them I don\u2019t let on to my SH and anxiety problems for fear they\u2019ll leave like so many others have- so I was really hoping getting into one of these clubs would help me make more friends/connections/friendly faces. I\u2019m kind of crushed to my core and questioning who I am and if I\u2019m even worthy of friendship or respect at this place because I didn\u2019t get tapped for membership. However, I\u2019m even more crushed that all save one of my closest friends are doing these groups, and I won\u2019t be, which means they\u2019ll be spending over 15 hours a week with all of these super amazing cool people. They will probably become better friends with their group members (I\u2019ve seen it happen to other people), and never speak to me again.  My friend who didn\u2019t get into a group is just as upset as I am, but has plans to move off campus and a full sports team so he\u2019s not that worried about being alone next year. \n\nI don\u2019t currently have a doctor, nor do I want to find one. I had my last SH episode over a year ago, and voluntarily went to get help. They tried to hospitalize me first, which was very weird and scary since I wasn\u2019t suicidal and was asking for help to stop an episode. When I went through four other doctor\u2019s screenings and they found me as not suicidal and didn\u2019t recommend hospitalization, the head psych told me five sessions of group therapy would cure me. I went to the therapy but it didn\u2019t really do anything for me. I think it made me really skeptical of doctors, tbh. Outside of group therapy, I re-evaluated my life. I realized I use SH as a punishment for fucking things up. Instead of SH, I left a lot of toxic friendships and relationships behind, and I was feeling better and stable for an entire year until tonight. Got out an old lighter and a spoon and just stared at them. I threw the lighter away and put the spoon back, but I feel like they\u2019re taunting me - offering me a way to punish myself for being such a failure in this process. However, I deeply do NOT want to start cycles of SH again, but it gets super hard when a wave of self-doubt and fear of being alone hits. I also don\u2019t want to go to a doctor because I don\u2019t have money or time for more group therapy sessions.

I'm not comfortable telling my mom because she'll just freak out and keep me on constant surveillance, and I really value my privacy. I dont wanna keep a diary either because I'm paranoid someone will read it or whatever. So I guess I'm just putting my thoughts down here. Idk if its acceptable or normal to keep updates of my life on reddit since idk anything about this app really. But I was recommended this app for welcoming communities so here we are. \n\nI don't really struggle with a lot of emotional problems, I don't have depression or anything accept social anxiety disorder. I'm not seeing a therapist or taking medication because our family cant afford it currently. That's one of the reasons I hurt myself. I suffer from panic attacks daily, but I despise attention and want to avoid anyone looking or talking to me. So I hide it. My attacks can get pretty bad so nothing but extreme measures takes me down. In my case, feeling something else other than panic is the only way to get me to calm down. Fidgets have never worked. And of course, various methods of self harm depending where I am is the most intense feeling I can give myself. The ways I hurt myself vary. I pinch and scratch myself, dig my nails into my hands/arms, pull out my hair, cut, bite myself, and probably others that I dont remember. I really dont want to, but if I dont I'll most likely faint and like I said, I'm deathly afraid of attention. So far I cant make it past 2 days clean without relapsing a few times a day. My mom knows I've hurt myself in the past, but she thinks I've stopped because I told her my anxiety went away to avoid any more attention. In reality its worse then it's ever been and I just cant stop. Like I said before, if I told her she'd panic and tell the rest of our family (because she did before) and I just cant deal with that humiliation again. \n\nSo basically my entire problem is that I dont like or want to self harm, but it's really the only thing that makes panic attacks fade. I cant get professional help or medication because of money, and I'm on my own because my mom just doesnt know how to handle it.

I'm not saying attention seeking cutting is bad (i mean all cutting is bad but thats besides the point), but it goes deeper into the brain than people that cut themselves for self hatred. Attention these days is what everyone desires, through social media, and irl, perhaps school.

Sometimes, we have to try something to prove it won't work to find a better solution.\n\nIce Cube technique:\n\nSome of you may have heard of it, some of you may even use it, but I will talk about it anyway. So, here is what you do. Take a cube of ice and hold it against the area where you self-harm. If you cut on your arms, put a cube of ice there and hold it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMarkers: Take a red marker and draw where you want the wound to be. Sometimes self-harm can be a physiological thing.\n\nMusic: This one is simple. Put on some headphones and blast some music. Not too loud, you don't want to go deaf or get tinnitus, but just zone out. In the words of Uncle Kracker, \"Give me the beat, boys and free my soul, I wanna get lost in your rock and roll, and drift away.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDelay: Just wait it out. Start out with 10 minutes or 5 minutes. It is possible the urge can go away during that time. Just tell yourself that  you won't SH for ten minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrozen Spoon Technique:  Put a spoon in the freezer and once it\u2019s cold enough, rub the edge against your skin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWall Sits: All you have to do is stand in a sitting position, but without the chair. You lean your back  against the wall and try to keep your legs at a 45\u00b0 angle. It takes a  lot of energy, that you would otherwise take out on yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHeating Cream:\n\nFinalgon is  a heating creme(there usually for cramps and in different  \"strengths\") Put a little bit of it where you would hurt yourself(but  please wear gloves!) Spread it a bit and wrap a bandage around it. At  first, it will feel really warm, but after a while it stings and  hurts, like you were cutting there, but it goes away after a while and  doesn't leave a sign you ever did something\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what this one is called, but I will call it the Frozen Knot Technique: What you do is, knot a wet washcloth or a cloth and freezing it, then work out the knot.\n\nThis one may not help subdue the urges to SH, but it can help you stop if you combine it with the above or other alternatives. (I will put a link to a website that I got these alternatives from. It has a more complete list.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor every cut that you make, you can't cut for that many days. Say, you cut yourself 5 times. You can't SH for five days. If you burn yourself or bruise yourself, say that you can't SH until it heals to a certain point.\n\nIt may not help you stop immediately, but it will probably be better than stopping cold turkey.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's all for now, folks. I will add more if I get any suggestions in the comments and I will add the breathing exercise once the person responds to my message.\n\nAlso, if you need someone to talk to, pm's are always welcomed. I may not know much, but I am a good listener.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Your desire to not self harm is a lot like your desire to swim against a fast flowing current. If you're stuck in a rushing stream, swimming against current, hoping to make gains against it will lead you nowhere. It is exhausting and eventually you capitulate to the currents will, which is analogous to relapsing and spiraling downwards from there. When you break your streak it feels like all the time spent not self harming, a time that you may have come to distinguish from the times before then involving self harm, feels almost invalidated. It seems like it never happened, since it all eventually led back to you doing what you did before, which makes you feel like nothing has changed despite your best efforts. The truth is a lot has changed. You clearly don't want to self harm, self harm doesn't define you. Your swimming against the current is an expression of your desire not to be defined by it. But just like the swimmer, you end up exhausted, drifting with the current, and in turn hopeless. Instead of swimming against it you must swim adjacent to it. You must swim to shore. There is a reason why you are self harming. Understanding the history behind your present state and the reasons you are engaging in self harm, can help to put distance between you and the overwhelming currents. The rapid is turbulent to navigate, and can cause you to crash or lead you far astray. Trying to fight these currents will end in you either feeling broken or lost, and often a combination of both. Swim to shore. Put distance between you and the current. A rushing rapid can be very beautiful and relaxing when viewed from outside it. If you find yourself unable to swim towards shore and if you find yourself drifting, grab a branch of a rock. Hold onto something. This could be a certain memory, or maybe the thought of a person that inspires you. Somebody that is like an indirect, mentor in your life that you may have never met but know a lot about. Or it could simply be your awareness of your present state. Our emotions have a great deal of leverage over our intuitions, since intuition is a feelingly process. We say this does not make sense, or that makes sense, or something feels off, because intuition is a feelingly process. Logic is known through intuition, and without feelings, reason if even in the most abstract form, would not be possible. Because of this, overwhelming emotions can have a great deal of influence over our intuition, causing it to search for any immediate way out of the matrix we find ourselves in. This makes our perception very near sighted, and therefore looks for short term relief at the expense of long term heartache and confusion, this is why we self harm. It is our intuition searching for an immediate way out. Anxiety is a very short sighted emotional state, that causes us to end up making decisions and acting in ways that we later regret once we've calmed down. Wait out the currents, it may be stormy now but the sun will come out. In the process, you will gain a great deal of strength, and an understanding of these currents that can be fruitful later on in your life. With every negative there is an equal positive. Despite how painful it is now, this experience has the potential to bring you an appreciation for life, and a sense of compassionate awareness that would be absent if you didn't experience this. So you relapsed, I know how that feels. It is no different than the way I view self harm in my life. I wish it never happened. But, if this experience can serve a purpose greater than itself, such that because you had this experience something positive can come about that wouldn't otherwise, it will find its place in the grander scheme of your life.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

So i just grabbed the blade i used to shave with, took the razors and just cutted myself a little bit around my thigts and felt relaxed for some minutes for the first time, so i kept doing it to this day, every day i cut myself not more than 1cm deep and around 5cms lenght like im just making myself some food, simple as that. \n\nThe thing is, now i go along with everyone at my school and just live a normal life, but i still feel so fucking depressed when i dont cut myself, i have learned to control and numb all my emotions with a blade, burning myself, drinking pure alcohol, eating some pieces of glass, you name it but even tho i live a normal life i still feel like a stupid piece of shit everytime i stop selfharming longer than some days and everyday im dealing with suicide thoughts like its nothing.\n\nWhy cant i just be happy? i work so hard to put a smile and treat everyone nice even tho some treated me like shit, i changed my whole image, my personality, im always cheering up everybody even if they're already happy and just try to not be a burden to everybody BUT IM STILL FEELING LIKE SHIT AND IM SURE EVERYBODY HATES ME AND JUST WANT ME TO KILL MYSELF i cant deal with anyone talking shit just because i help people that they hate and its driving me crazy i just want a true hug and cry, smile, scream and let every feeling inside me go away im fucking tireeeeeeeeeed to be alive.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

It was 6 years ago, I had just turned 15. I had been in a bad place for almost a year. It had indeed been a very busy year. I had witnessed my brother almost dying over the summer and fell for a guy who became my distraction, helping me overcome the trauma. The guy ended up c heating on me, and more importantly, physically abused me. His new gf was bullying me along with him and the whole school started to do as well. \n\nNeedless to say i felt very lonely, and with all of these events, i realised that i was bisexual as i met a girl. This girl has been my anchor to the world for a while but also showed me the world of selfharm, as she was severely depressed. \n\nAnyway, i was seating on my bed, and i had just broken a glass. I remember the moment exactly. I looked at the glass on the floor, took a big piece of it. I looked at it with an intense curiosity, and instead of throwing it, i cut the skin on the palm of my hand. A long, lean cut. It bled a lot, and i watched the blood flowing for a long long time. I didn\u2019t feel anything, i was in a sort of trance. \n\nLater that day, i went iceskatting with friends. We laughed. The difference between how i felt inside and what i transmit struck me. \n\nIt was the first time i selfharmed. It was not the last, of course. It became an addiction quickly. As everyone, it was a way to materialise the pain, to *see* where the pain was coming from. The gesture also calmed me deeply. I had frequent panic attacks, and selfharming was a way to make it all stop quickly. \n\nI stopped the intentional selfharm 4 years ago, because i started dating someone i was truly in love, who had very little experience with traumas, selfharm, and mental illness in general. I didn\u2019t want them to enter that world and put up with it on a daily basis. So i found the strength to stop in the unconditional love they gave me. \n\nI broke up with them last summer, and the urge immediately came back to me. However, i\u2019m not starting again, because i\u2019m too afraid. Too afraid of the consequences, what it means, and to face the state of my mental health. \n\nHere, looking back on all those years, i think i can say i\u2019m proud of what i achieved. However the fight is not over for me, i still physically hurt myself without realising it, and that\u2019s what i have to work on. \n\nI don\u2019t really know why i felt like i had to share, but i\u2019m glad i did.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I\u2019ve hit a point where it\u2019s gotten really out of hand, but I don\u2019t reach out. At all. No one. My best friend has a history with sh too, and at the beginning of the year we both promised to stop, although i knew deep down i wasn\u2019t actually going to. I know that\u2019s really awful of me, to blatantly lie about that, but he just looked so happy when I told him I would try to stop. I didn\u2019t want to disappoint him.\n\nAbout a month later I already relapsed, and pretty bad (you can actually find the picture of the scars in one of my firsts posts that I put on r/selfharmscars to celebrate them being 2 months old). I tried so hard that following week to confess to my friend, but I couldn\u2019t. A month later, I relapsed again, and couldn\u2019t bring myself to tell him either. I\u2019m just so terrified of disappointing him, and I\u2019ve been in really abusive relationships in the past that reacted to it all so awfully.\n\nMy old \u201cbest friend\u201d, instead of asking if I was okay or show any amount of concern like I always did whenever she told me anything, lashed out on me telling me that my troubles were nothing compared to hers, and that she had it so much worse, belittling me. (This caused me to adopt a really negative view on my struggles, and how ill never be \u201cas bad\u201d as anyone else and that I\u2019m insignificant and fake, and I started to plummet a lot and started cutting *deep*, to \u201cprove myself\u201d). \n\nMy ex girlfriend reacted to it by self harming, herself, trying to replicate all of my cuts and stuff. I stopped telling her because whenever I did she would do it herself. She was extremely manipulative in our relationship and caused me to spiral downward, and it was her that was pulling me down. The only reason why I was able to leave her was because of my best friend, who I love with my whole heart. \n\nHe pulled me out of it all, and helped me, and still is, helping me heal. But he doesn\u2019t know, or at least didn\u2019t know that I was secretly still cutting. I didn\u2019t want him to know. But these past couple weeks it\u2019s escalated a lot, and I don\u2019t feel in control with myself anymore. I don\u2019t trust myself. I can get really reckless in the moment, and deeply regret it. \n\nBut another reason why I didn\u2019t want to tell him is because I know he has baggage of his own. I know from experience with my ex, it\u2019s awful when someone just carelessly or purposely dumps all of their mental health issues on you, causing you to have to deal with it and try to fix it. It\u2019s too much, and it ends up dragging you down with them. I didn\u2019t want to do that to him, and I\u2019m still afraid that I\u2019m going to. \n\nAnd I was afraid that he was going to get mad at me like my old best friend did, and yell at me. He didn\u2019t at all. He was so concerned and wanted to make sure I was okay. He gave me advice on what to do if I had the urge, and kept saying things like \u201cit\u2019s all going to be okay, we\u2019re going to get through this together, I\u2019m here for you\u201d. I started crying, because I\u2019ve never gotten that reaction before. No, I have, but it was from him too. When he wanted me to break up with my ex because he saw how trapped and how it was crushing and breaking me. He\u2019s the only person that\u2019s ever shown real genuine concern for me, and I don\u2019t want to ever lose him.\n\nI finally gathered the courage to tell him, and we\u2019re planning to go tell the school guidance counselor after spring break (the whole week off is *so* convenient *yay*) although I\u2019m still scared. But I\u2019m so glad after two months, I was finally able to tell him, and if he were to ever read this, I would just want him to know that he is the most kind hearted person I know and I love him so much and I wouldn\u2019t give him up for anything. I\u2019ve never met someone I care about more, and would do anything for him.\n\nI love you so much J*****, thanks for dealing with all my shit dude", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I immediately choked on my words as I noticed this man behind the counter had hundreds of scars from cuts going all the way up both of his arms, starting at his wrists and going up his bicep into his sleeves where I could no longer follow. I paused for a second, I blinked, and continued with my order hoping he didn't notice that I'd noticed his scars, because I didn't want to make him uncomfortable. While I finished my order, my entire mind was screaming. I was focusing on just ordering food normally, but I felt my voice shaking as I spoke. \n\nI don't really know why, but I very suddenly felt a strong connection with this man. I have never seen scars like those anywhere except my own body. He probably had no idea I connected with him, because I always cut my thighs, not arms. I hadn't cut myself in about a month, but while I sat in the corner eating my sandwich, I began to feel that familiar itch on my legs and the desire in my head to go home and cut them open again. \n\nMy question accompanied by this story is this: When you see someone else in public, and happen to notice they have scars, do you feel a connection with them? Do you feel a desire to cut yourself again? Is it rude to say something?

Now all I want to do is a cut in this incredibly specific spot on my shoulder and a bunch on my hip.\n\nI know I wouldn\u2019t stop.  I just don\u2019t want to worry or upset my boyfriend.  I plan on wearing mens swim trunks, so I\u2019ll have zero problems hiding it in the summer.\n\nIf I knew this would have an end, where I won\u2019t have urges anymore, where I won\u2019t want to cut, this would be so much easier.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019ll ever happen.\n\nOh, I wanted to ask if anyone gets a sensation where they want to or normally cut whenever they have urges.\n\n^^Fuck ^^Spring\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to bed without a new cut.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I do still cut myself from time to time because it's easy.

There is something about the way they can burn through the skin as you grind them in. You can hear them burn away the flesh and the smell is like nothing else.\nI'm one of the fortunate ones for many reasons because I don't scar heavily and the work I do let's me explain away many of my injuries. It's easy to lie to people about the cuts Burns bruises and scraps as long as I don't do it to often.\nI try not to do this crap but sometimes I just don't have a choice anymore. I know we always have a choice but choosing not to just seems to worsen the inevitable.\nI fought it good recently. I decided I wasn't going to cut myself to calm my head. I had only put two fresh cuts in my arm; nice shallow ones just to bleed a little. After that I decided I wasn't going to do anymore. I put the knife back in to my toolbox and decided to get back to what I was working on. \nBefore I even knew what I was doing I grabbed a nice course round file, the kind used for woodworking and drug it across my arm. It hurt nicely as it tore away a little skin. The next two times, same thing. It was a new type of hurt as it tore away skin. After that I kinda stopped feeling it and by about two dozen rips with that file I realized I had torn a good sized area up. That was a new kind of pain that settled my head nicely and lasted for days.\nThere are times I wish I could stop. There are times I do manage to go a good long spell without doing it at all, simply finding non harmful ways to cause pain. The problem is, since no one seems to care I find no reason to ever fully stop. \nIt is what it is and it's better than my other solution for now.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

It was at the point that I didn't want to keep doing it, but I was addicted, and couldn't bring myself to stop. I had thought about suicide a few times, but always wised up before I could ever consider it seriously. I was a miserable mess due to severe anxiety, and I was borderline eating disorder (anorexia). I would spend a few nights a week having anxiety issues over the tiniest thing, and crying out the frustrations and stress of it all. I was at the point in life where I wasn't necessarily seriously suicidal, but I wasn't at all afraid to die. I wanted to have a future, but I didn't want to keep being so trapped inside my own head. It was hell, to be blunt.\n\n Update, April 12th, 2019:\n\nI threw out my razors a few weeks ago, and I'm a month clean this Thursday. I finally realized there are people out there who love me to the moon and back (my best friend Carlie, who I wouldn't trade for the world, and my then best guy-friend, and now boyfriend of one month, who I love SO, SO MUCH, and now we're working on getting him clean, too, to name my top two reasons for getting better \u2764) and that I needed to do it for them, if nobody else. I've recently auditioned for a Senior Apprenticeship at the dance studio I take ballet classes at (I find out the results sometime around May 2nd. Fingers crossed!!!!) and I've decided to take my college major in the future as psychology, so I can help people who have dealt with these kinds of things, and people who are legally psychologically disturbed. And I want my minor to be something to do with dance, or more likely, art so I can work with tattooing on the side, and if all goes well, open up a parlor with said boyfriend. (I thought teenagers could never ACTUALLY be in love, and all they wanted was to be able to say they had a S/O, but honestly, I think he's in it for the long haul with me. \u2764 My first boyfriend ever, too! It's worth the wait, girls and guys, trust me.) And, I'm eating healthy, and I'm back to a normal, stable diet. Honestly, I snack now, too, and I didn't think I would ever be proud to sneak into the kitchen at 12am to make ramen. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02  I'm doing better than ever, all thanks to the people who love me.\n\nMy advice to anybody going through this kind of thing, IT GETS BETTER. I *PROMISE.* I didn't think it would, but lo and behold, in just a few months, I've turned my life around 180\u00b0 and I'm the happy, cheerful, lively person who I never thought I'd be again. Get help, please, for the sake of yourself and the sake of those who care about you. I promise, it isn't worth suffering with until it's too late. Thank you to everybody who stuck with me through it all. I couldn't have done it without you. Catch you on the flip side of everything.... Carlie, and my goofy little Dork of mine...

I was a little stunned, and mortified. A mutual friend confirmed that he was in fact, cutting himself. But the bulk of this story is about a week ago. We were moved to sit back to back, and we would chat a bit during class, mostly laughing at other kids, and him getting annoyed at my fidgeting, and his sweatshirt sleeve slipped. It was unnerving, his cuts were perfect and uniform, I only saw two but they seemed like the same length, about an inch, and semi deep and fresh-ish I'd give it 2 days. I confronted him about it over snapchat after school and he told me it wasn't what I thought it was or something. I'm not sure how to help him.

Their depth means a long road to a full recovery. Help groups and therapy are going fantastic, and I'm hopeful I won't continue to make the same mistakes. \nMy scars extend from my wrists to my shoulders. Some completely healed years ago, some still healing. I can't help but notice the condition of my skin taking an odd turn. Scars (no matter how old) are covered in large pores that look similar to blackheads, and small white bumps that look so much like a pimple that I've tried to pop them. These 'blackheads and pimples' are on upper and lower arms and are always directly over the scar. \n\nMy question is: Has anyone experienced similar things on their scars? I dont know why it's concerning me so much, but it would put my mind at ease to know someone else is experiencing the same patterns. \nOutside of my therapist, I don't actually talk openly about anything self-harm related.

I'm a 20 year-old male student athlete who should be at college, but I was \"nudged\" into taking a medical leave of absence for this semester. I started cutting when I was 14. I still get asked today what the scars are from and I usually say that it was a biking accident and I landed on a metal grate. It didn't stop when I was 14, and only got worse. I've been to 3 psych wards, a wilderness program, and 2 different residential treatment centers totaling to just around a year and a half in in-patient treatment. After all of that, I went to a non-traditional but non-therapeutic boarding school and finally finished high school after being held back a year, which is hard to explain discretely when you've pretty much had a 4.0 your whole life. I've tried so many different meds and different kinds of therapy, including Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and Electroconvulsive Therapy (yes, they still do that; also I was the youngest person there by about 25 years at the hospital). The point is that I've tried everything for my depression. My trauma, anxiety, OCD, and insomnia just make it that much harder. I'd also like to point out that this is my first ever reddit post, so please forgive my bad storytelling. I just need to get this off my chest and hopefully find some people who can relate. I feel so alone at \"home\" and stay in bed all day. I talk to my girlfriend everyday who I followed from high school to college, and she is just living her own life now. We used to be so close and did everything together at boarding school. Now she just responds to all of messages once or twice a day saying \"I miss you too.\" We've been together for over 3 years now and I can feel the flame dying out, but I'm doing everything I can to kindle it and make her happy, as I always have. I stayed away from cutting for a while with only the occasional slip-up for a long time by just burying myself in my schoolwork and sports. But you can't continue on like that for that long, hence the leave of absence after going to an adult psych ward with a convicted felon and people who ran away from ghosts in the halls. At least I have some stories to tell after all of my treatment experiences. But as fate would have it, even that has been partially taken away from me with the memory-loss side effects from getting my brain zapped one too many times (ECT). My short term memory is not that good anymore and I've lost some memories from the past, but lucky for me, all of the trauma got to stay, making me wake up with nightmares every night, which I never did consistently. So, after this and family problems and my depression sucking me deeper into the darkness, I've fallen back into my old ways, only worse this time, seeing that my pain tolerance has only increased over all of the many attempts to get a break from feeling worse than nothing. As a result of this, I've been going to the hospital and now burn clinic consistently because of my more serious \"accidents.\" I hope this post didn't make anyone feel worse, and especially not make anyone want to self-harm. I did my best to make everything as PG as possible even though we all know life is rated the one after 'R,' and not X or XXX, or else we'd all be a little happier. I hope that you all and myself can get away from this one day, and hopefully soon. Please feel free to comment and ask me questions. I'll just be sitting in my bed and going to doctors. Nobody wants to be alone. One of the worst thing you can do to a person is make them alone, hence solitary confinement. And if there are any guys out there who can relate, I'd especially appreciate it if you reached out to talk or even just make a comment. I've met very few guys who deal with this issue that we all subscribe to on some weird website. \\~Q", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I\u2019m terrified of telling her because what she saw was ***nothing***.\nI\u2019ve screwed up so bad, there\u2019s not an inch of me that isn\u2019t covered in scars and fresh wounds. And I can\u2019t cover them easily either, they\u2019re deep. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do. She always has to be perfect for my grandma too, and the first thing she talked about once she saw a tiny bit of my leg was \u201cYour grandmas going to be on me, and say that I\u2019m a terrible mother and you should be in therapy now, thanks a lot\u201d. Like umm, maybe she\u2019ll say that because I **should** be in therapy?? Like I\u2019m sorry people are going to comment on your bad parenting, maybe you should, I don\u2019t know, *do the right thing?* . So what if people know that you have a mentally I\u2019ll daughter, they\u2019d **like** you more if they knew that you got your kid help when they needed it, rather than hide it to save your *perfect image*", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I\u2019ve never felt any shame, even when confronted about it by my friends, family, and boyfriend. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m so used to it being an emotional outlet that it seems fine to me. But I\u2019ve never felt any reason to stop. \n\nI know when I cut on my torso it\u2019s out of sadness or grief. Any other time where I was stressed out or overwhelmed it would just be on the forearm. I\u2019m trying to understand why I don\u2019t feel ashamed, why I want to cut all the time and why it\u2019s so pleasing to me when I make hypertrophic scars. \n\nI think part of it might be because I like the smooth protrusions when they heal over. They feel kind of special. Since I\u2019m in at art school, nobody calls me out or asks me about the scars just because a lot of students have it so there\u2019s no shame there.

I was wearing it the last time I cut, and must've missed one when emptying my pockets of the other blades I had in there. I was going to put it away, but on my way to do so wondered how sharp it was, and didn't think twice before testing it out, which of course didn't stop at one or two shallow cuts. I realized like halfway through what I was doing and that I was supposed to be trying to stop, but by that point I had already thrown my streak away and I was still feeling like shit from earlier, so I kept going. That proved to be a stupid decision, because I hit a vein a few minutes later. Everything was fine, as I'm used to dealing with this and they're never major bleeds (so far). Now I feel better, but also worse because my resolve only lasted a day, and hitting veins more frequently was a lot of the reason why I wanted to quit. Last time I cut I hit three in a row. I'm worried my cutting is getting more dangerous, and I don't want to kill myself accidentally. \n\nIdk how to end this so yeah :/", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Now that I'm thinking about it she has put me through so much unnecessary shit I could make a book about it.**\n\n+-----------+\n\nLike all of the incidents including her it happened in school cause she does not \"have time\" to talk to me after school because she \"has homework\" (*even though we have the same classes and the teachers don't have the time to be grading 200+ papers.*) That day I didn't want to deal with people if I could've I would have just stayed home and slept all day or just play Splatoon and try to forget about my problems...\n\nSo my \"friend\" she only likes me for my fake happy personality. I pretend to be happy and like the people at school but if you're my friend i expect you to be able to appreciate the real me. But she obviously does not so that's why I'm so excited to be able to not see her again. She never likes it when I try to ask her to help me. In my opinion, a real friend should be able to help you when you're down... Unlike her.\n\nOkay, tangent over now okay so I was not in the mood to deal with anyone and my \"friend\" noticed that. So she leaves me alone... Now i know I said I wasn't in the mood to talk I just like having company cause I know that if I were to be left alone I would probably just cut myself. (*I don't bring razors to school but I can get pretty creative...*) I made it known to her before that If I'm not in a good mood not to leave me alone... Just don't talk to me and I'll be fine because it makes me feel like more of a piece of shit if you leave me alone.\n\nSo what does she do... SHE LEAVES ME ALONE. So at this time, I was in reading class which is the worst class to leave me alone in because I sit in the back at the teacher's desk in this class. (*it's not because I'm trouble or anything it's just that the teacher never sits there and he doesn't say me and \"friend\" can't sit there.*) And of course like a good teacher he has extra school supplies at his desk... Push pins, scissors, pencils, paperclips...etc. So all class I tried to ignore the abundance of sharp objects around me(*which I failed and also i couldn't move seat cause 1. There were no other seats and 2. The teacher hates when people get up*)\n\nI would probably be more forgiving If she wasn't looking at me every 5 mins with a smug look on her face. (*I feel like she left me alone on purpose and she knew what would result in doing that. Also it's not like she could see my from the corner of her eye she had to turn her head 90\u00b0 to see me.*)\n\nThen after class, we went to history (*we have assigned seats*). Where she says to me \"why can't you be happier.  I know you have depression and all that but sometimes you just need to lighten up. You know you're just bringing all of our moods down.\"\n\nSo I just spent the whole class trying not to cry and hating humanity a little bit more than usual. I don't know why her approval of me is so important to me I just wish I wasn't like this.HHHHH.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

It\u2019s 00:25 local time here and the people of the night have appeared. \n\nFirst of all, in the waiting room I get into a conversation with a drunk old man and a woman who had cut her hand while slicing bread. \n\n\u00abDo you think they\u2019ll get to us before sunrise?\u00bb the woman asks. The drunk man groans and I just nodded in consent. \n\nThey both get in before me and I am left alone to listen to the yelling of a livid drug addict who just had to pee, the poor guy. Things quiets down until another clearly intoxicated guy, younger this time and eastern european, not speaking the language, sits down next to me. I barely glance over at him and see that his whole face is covered in blood. Lucky me got to find out why later. \n\n\u00abHow u doin?\u00bb he slurrs. Mind you, I have a deep gash in my arm, I\u2019m tired, he\u2019s drunk and has blood dripping from his chin. I am in no mood for conversation. I just nod and say that I\u2019m good. \nHe keeps going for a while, asking me how I\u2019m good if I\u2019m sitting in a waiting room in the ER. Luckily he gets picked up by a doctor before I have to answer. \n\n20 mins later a woman arrives with a police escort. She\u2019s furious and violent and the nurses obviously didn\u2019t want any of the other patients to get in her line of fire because I\u2019m brought to the room where the stitches will be done before the doctor has arrived. Again I am left waiting and I can hear everything that is going on in the hallway outside as well as in the room next door, which was this:\n\nIn broken english a nurse is desperatly trying to ask someone with equally broken english if they fainted when they were injured. \n\n\u201cWere you unconscious?\u201d\n\nNo response.\n\nA sigh. \u201cDid you sort of black out?\u201d\n\nAgain no response.\n\n\u201cI mean, did you pass away?\u201d\n\nI almost fall off the table I\u2019m sitting on.\nUnfortunately I didn\u2019t hear the answer (if there even was one). The nurse gives up and starts talking about x-rays before I hear her leave. \n\nNext door is quiet before there is a sound like a shower turning on,  followed by a loud burp. \nA doorknob turns behind me and I think it\u2019s finally the doctor, but lo and behold: it\u2019s the drunk Eastern European guy from earlier. He\u2019s just standing there, slightly swaying back and forth before he dumps down next to my legs on the table i\u2019m sitting on. Turns out there are unlocked doors between all the treatment rooms and that this guy is my neighbor! What a genious idea! Good for doctors perhaps, but at night, when the majority of the patients are under some sort of influence and can become downright violent and quite scary, this isn\u2019t great. \n\nThe guy starts chatting me up, asking what my name is and why I\u2019m here. He\u2019s watching me, looking for any sings of injury, but my arm is still bandaged and under my sleeve.\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d I turn the question to him, trying to steer the conversation away from me. Turns out he had taunted some people in a gang and had gotten a fist in the face for his effort. \n\nI\u2019m trying to be polite to this person. It\u2019s the middle of the night, I\u2019m alone in a room with this very drunk and very impulsive man who shouldn\u2019t be here and I\u2019m honestly feeling unsafe. I try to get him to leave and go back to his own room, but he won\u2019t. \nHe then tries to place a hand on my knee after telling me that \u201cI look nice and that I should be good.\u201d and I reach me limit and just growl at him not to touch me. Fortunately he gets it and backs off, but not before he opens the door to the hallway to holler that \u201cthis girl needs help!!!!\u201d\nAnd then he\u2019s gone. \nI tell a nurse who peeps into my room and she apologizes, and after she closes the door I hear her say to her colleague: \n\u201cWho the hell is he and where did he come from?\u201d referring to the guy who just left my room. Apparently the staff has just as little overview of their patients as I have.\n\nThe doctor arrives and starts with the stitches and during the while process I can hear the drunk guy have yelling matches with the furious lady mentioned earlier. He also manages to peep into my room through the back door while I\u2019m getting the stitches. \n\nAll in all an interesting experience. The doctors and nurses were kind and understanding, but I could have done without all the extra events. It didn\u2019t help that I met my elementary school bully on the bus stop on my way home, haha.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

And I'm setting my sights on even more clean days this next go around. \n    \n     This is super unstructured and ramble-y I know, please forgive me and my post-harm adrenaline high, but my main goals ig were to reach out to anyone who feels like their self harm is 'odd' in any way, whether it be method or location. And to remind everybody that recovery is about small steps and ups, downs, plateaus, etc. Y'know, \"progress is never linear\" n all that sappy shit. You can start the quitting process RIGHT NOW. Please try to appreciate each good day for what it is and take on each bad day just the same.  Good or bad, you still gotta swallow. And hey. Take it easy on yourself. The key for me was the difference between the thought process of \"I do bad things\" vs \"I am bad\". The latter sentiment immediately snuffs out any hope of improvement. The voice that's telling you that is your mental illness, and it's a big fat liar. \n\nLife is one bitch of a fight. Good luck n keep fighting everyone.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Left arm. The scars go up to about an inch below my elbow, mostly on the bottom of my arm, but a couple are visible even on the top of my arm. I kinda just hacked and slashed-- deep cuts, scars quite raised.\n\nI'm not really fashionable with clothing, my aesthetic is essentially Ted Mosby: Jeans, shirt, open button-up. I like wearing a bandanna now and then, but that's irrelevant. I also like bananas. Also irrelevant, but I looked at the word bandanna and thought it said banana and thought it was funny.\n\nI lurk mostly, but just found this sub and am hoping to find some advice.\n\nScars too raised for tattoos. Not that I have money for tattoos, likewise can't afford surgery.\n\nIdeas so far: sweatband, whatever Rey has on her arms, leather cuffs (I'm in a rock band so that's not as stupid as it sounds, I have a 90's grunge vibe), or like a surgical thing, and I just say it's cuz of my tendonitis-- that's really only a temp solution though.\n\nMan, that's it. As I said, not so fashion forward, or even fashion current. But I'm happy to try new things.\n\n(From here I kinda ramble, read if you want but it's not super related to the question)\n\nI've been pretty casual about my scars for the past couple years. Work in sales, uniform is short sleeves, and I'm in Aus so too hot for layers, so I'm concious about which arm I use to gesture, I fold my arms or have them behind my back when talking, but now and then customers notice, and I get that look... One customer asked. I said it was something from my teens. He showed me a tattoo he regretred. He was trying to relate and I appreciate it, it was nice.\n\nThe looks get exhausting though. All my friends and band members have seen the scars, but have never asked. It's....well tbh I don't know what it is. But one of my bands is picking up, regular gigs, and more and more photos of us performing-- a couple of which I can tell have been touched up to hide my scars. I'm singer, frontman, arms are out and up and gesturing all the time-- people are drunk so they dont notice probably, but nonetheless I'm centre of attention.\n\nBut mostly it's just casual outings. Meeting new people, I'm tired of awkwardly folding my arms / angling myself certain ways in hope new people dont notice. And then they do. There's always that beat of silence before they continue. I always notice it. I honestly appreciate that they're kind enough to look past it and treat me like normal, but I wish I didn't have to give them that burden in the first place.\n\nI guess this turned into a rant more than a question, but this sub allows rants so I hope it's okay.\n\nA couple pints in, so I just wanna take a second to say the people I've met since having these scars have been genuinely nice by ignoring them and treating me normal, and I'm super grateful. But, I'm terrified of that time I meet someone who isn't like that. Hence this question.\n\nSo, back on topic... other than tattoos or long sleeve shirts. What can I add to my casual attire that would hide the scars?\n\nThere is no tl;dr, the title is the point of this post, the rest is just a rant.\n\nThanks in advance to anybody who comments.\n\nEdit: quick edit to say thanks to everybody who commented. I learned something about myself too: that I'm onlg comfortable talking about my scars after a few pints. Hence my late responses. I'm getting my drunk on after weekly rehearsal. That 's a whole thing I gotta look into myself, but again thank you to everyone who commented, I appreciate your advice, and most importantly I assume you're all on this sub for a reason, so, I wish you all the very best :) thanks again and much love xoxoxo", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I ended up in the hospital for about 8 hours. 2 of those were waiting and getting my stitches done. I got 15 in total, 3 of which were dissolvable while the rest were your standard stitches. Then after that they whisked me away in a wheel chair to a gurney down stairs where I changed into a hospital gown and wait for 6 hours for a psych eval. \n\nLet me tell you, the lady who did the eval was probably one of the worst people that I\u2019ve met for that. Not only did she keep trying to insinuate that my mother might be autistic, which she isn\u2019t, but then she kept going on and not even explaining things like type 2 bipolar or BPD. \n\nAnd I know I\u2019m not the easiest person to work with since once I find you distasteful I shut down and will get hostile. This of course didn\u2019t help the fact that I had managed to acquire a fucking migraine and my arm was hurting. So this coupled with the fact that I found her to be a rude cunt did not help the situation. At all. \n\nBut for some strange reason she decided to discharge me. She asked about the precipitating event like I knew what that and it took me looking confused for her to explain what that meant. And I told her that yes, the event had deescalated and while my girlfriend was technically a part of the reason this happened, she was and still is genuinely concerned for my well being. She was like alright well time to discharge you. \n\nI was so confused because the way she acted up until that point was totally different. When I asked her why she did a whole 180 and changed her stance. She told me, and I quote. \u201cQuit while you\u2019re ahead.\u201d She felt that I should have been admitted yet because this momentary fight with my girlfriend was over, and yet I know the feelings I had will pop back up, that because she was concerned for me that that was enough to discharge me and send me home. \n\nI got out the hospital at 2am and I went straight to my best friends house to just decompress. I got maybe an hour and half of sleep before having to go home and change for work.\n\nAnd guess what I still get to work. On a limited capacity. Meaning I only get desk duty now.

We were celebrating a birthday of my group mate and eventually discussion somehow reached gay people. Usually, I can make a facade of indifference, since stating my opinion on the matter can potentially really harm me, unfortunately. This time I was surprisingly able to resist the urge to voice my thoughts, but then theu started to talk about how gays apparently cut themselves and how apparently \"funny\" it is. My hands started shaking and I felt my heart beating rapidly. I immediately left the room without any warning and didn't come back. Some of my groupmates know I cut but here it doesn't really matter. On my way home I couldn't hold back tears. I literally cried in public transport and wasn't even the first time. I don't even know why I cried. I just couldn't NOT cry. \nBefore I got home I went to the pharmacy to at the very least buy something that can help me heal the cuts I was going to do.\n\nAt home my cat greeted me, as usual. I was devastated at this point so I wanted to cut as soon as possible. But my cat missed me while I was gone, so I picked her up for a little cuddle. She immediately began to purr loudly. As I scratched behind her ears, she closed her eyes (a sing of happiness and trust for cats) and put her head on my shoulder.\n\nAt this point I couldn'thold it any longer. The urge to hurt suddenly disappeared. I was myself once again. Even for just this brief moment. Even though I didn't want to kill myself this time it felt like she gave me one of her lifes.\n\nWell, sorry for being kinda cheesy at the end here :D And thanks for reading this, hope everything's is going well for you.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

It's been a while since I've made myself heard on this subreddit or any subreddit at that. I just needed some time to think, I guess. But, I thought if share the past few weeks of my life with you guys.\n\nSo, about three weeks ago; my mom jokingly told me she thought I was cutting and needed to confirm her suspicions. This all went down because I got a little reckless one night and slashed up my arm pretty bad. All the cuts were shallow, but I made so many at one time that my entire upper arm turned red from irritation and became really noticeable, especially if you take into account that I was covering it up with bandage wrap ( my father is a former Army medic). I tried to wriggle out the hole I dug for myself, but after I realized she wasn't gonna drop the subject and was becoming increasingly impatient, I admitted to cutting.\n\nI was so sure she'd be mad; lately (5-6 months or so) she had just seemed so disappointed and disapproving of me. It had gotten to the point that I began suppressing any positive emotions I felt around her because I knew whatever came out her mouth would hurt me 2x as bad than if I just felt numb. But, that didn't happen. She called my dad in to inform him, and he did seem very shocked; he just held an \"I'm in very deep thought\" look most of the time. She talked to me for about three hours after my reveal, and it was the most reassuring conversation I'd had with anyone for months. I had actually convinced myself that no one loved me and I would rot alone. I thought that I was worthless trash. But, she just hugged me close, and she held me in her arms for hours. \n\nI laughed and giggled the whole time; to the severe concern of my mother and father. I didn't find anything that was happening funny, though. I don't know why I laughed; maybe smiling and laughter are just my coping mechanisms for when I feel on-edge and uncertain, I don't know. All I do know is that I feel happy and wanted, now. I get yelled at and berated a whole lot less, and my emotions on topics that I find sensitive are taken into account more. My mom has this \"no shaving\" rule for me now; which kind of messes me up considering I am a teenage girl with hair. But, I'm just glad that she cares; that's all I've wanted.\n\n I had never cut to gain attention; I just genuinely couldn't give less of a fuck if I'm all scarred up. In fact, I love cuts and bruises. I often look at the scars of the people that surround me, and I find myself wanting a particular scar someone else has. I cut myself up in the past because I wanted a distraction. I often bottled up my emotions, and I still do, so much so that by the end of the day I'd be in full-on rage mode. I could've punched a hole in the wall many of those nights. \n\nI haven't cut in almost a month now, and although I wouldn't mind seeing a few fresh cuts; I wanna stay clean for my family. In addition to flustering my mom and dad; I left my sister in tears and my eldest brother concerned after they found out. When I hurt myself, I hurt them, too. And, I don't want that.

She knows I \"used to\" cut last year but she thinks I was done with it after I went to a psychologist (which did help, but only temporary, since it not exactly a doctor). \nAnd I don't think my problems even need treatment. I don't know. Ugh.\n\nThanks for reading this. And also thanks in advance if you can advise me something..", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I stay in there until the bleeding stops (if the cuts are minor. If they\u2019re serious, apply pressure beforehand, and go to the emergency room if the bleeding is out of control or looks like it\u2019s pumping out with a rhythm/is too deep) \n\nStep 2 - while I\u2019m in the shower, I clean. I mean everything. Shave, exfoliate, face wash, shower gel, wash hair. I find this helps distract me. I have something to do while waiting for the bleeding to stop, and it stops me from immediately relapsing. Also, it helps me feel cleaner when I get out of the shower, so I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m covered in dried blood and sweat. It\u2019s kind of refreshing. \n\nStep 3 - when I get out the shower, I dry both myself and the cuts, treat them with antiseptic, and dress them. \n\nStep 4 - I get changed into completely fresh clothes. Again, this helps with feeling cleaner.  \n\nStep 5 - if I still feel like I need to distract, I clean my room and change my sheets. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if this isn\u2019t helpful, but it works for me so I hope it can for someone else.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

We were there for a while but after my evaluation the person we were talking with recommended I be partially hospitalized for around 3 weeks which is basically the rest of the school year for me.

Bare in mind I have cut since 15 and I'm 23 now. (Also on mobile)\nThere's so many young people struggling with mental health issues these days that self harm is not uncommon. It's ALWAYS a problem. It helps, but it is also downright an issue. So I'm not shaming anyone. However as someone who has struggled with this more or less for years now I noticed that for most people self-harm is a phase in their life. I know many eho have self-harmed but the common thread that separates most of them (and some of you guys might relate) is for them it was only a phase at a bad time in their life. Some are left with light scarring and don't even have urges anymore. Some are more severely marked and probably struggled more with urges later in comparison. Many of them still struggle, but they don't self-harm. In the same way anymore at least - important to note. Alas, there is me. This has become an addiction. I have had good periods of course. I have fought battles and won over this impulse to harm myself so many times. Even now in such a hard period of my life I still win many days. I am proud. But I'm also ashamed of still being so trapped. That I never feel as clear and free in my mind as when I go juuust deep enough. If only people knew. Seeing young teens speaking way too casually about their early days of self-harm hurts. Knowing they have no real idea what they could potentially end up with. You will shock people sometimes but simultaneously it'll fade into a simple fact. Proof of my cutting was found; mum tells me slightly frustrated to \"not do it\". Having to ask my doctor to take blood from the other arm and again; \"You shouldn't do that.\" Confiding in someone while drunk and then they'll ask you if you're doing better.

It disassociates us from self harm and the thoughts with it. So far it has helped me tremendously. I'm so where in the one month mark now I think, but honestly I have no clue! All I'm focused on is not doing it today. Not the days ahead, just today. And if you do relapse, try not to be so harsh on yourself, just focus on tomorrow. \n\nYou can do this, I believe in you.

I almost lost my closest friend, just because she was convinced that I was doing it for attention, even though she was the only person she knew that was aware I was doing it. AND she found out by accident. (She was still right, but it says a lot about your best friend when they abandon you over you needing support from them).\n\nI'm not posting this for attention in the same way I cut myself again. I just need to let off some steam, but I want this to also serve as a PSA to those who suffer from similar behavior on this subreddit: if you're doing it for attention, don't be ashamed of it. It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't mean you don't deserve help and support any more than those that are mentally unstable or face true urges to cut. You matter to me, and it doesn't matter why you're doing this. You are, and that means something is wrong, so make sure you get help. You'll be glad you did.\n\nAnd on a final note, I've hidden my knives from sight or access. I am learning lessons from self harming for attention and I want this chapter of my life to end. Not to be all r/congratslikeimfive or whatever but I am really proud of myself for having not done it again since last night!", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Iused to cut a bit about a year ago, but not much. I got cleaned up for the summer, had some small relapses throughout the fall and winter, but nothing major. I\u2019d never really sought out any help with it as it wasn\u2019t a big problem. I told one friend who stopped talking to me about a week later, and told another one who was incredibly unsupportive and was the cause of a lot of the things that led me to start cutting. I tried to cut her out (no pun intended), and managed to do this for a little while which led to me cleaning up, but recently she has started trying to be a part of my life again.\n\nI cut because I feel the need to have some control. If I can\u2019t control my thoughts or other peoples actions, at least I can control my pain. This has led to me not reaching out to people who I suspect are cutting as well, because I know that they will cause me to cut more, because if they cut too, then they\u2019re mental state and suicidal urges are yet another thing that\u2019s out of my control.\n\nRecently, I started dating someone who also cuts, but for different reasons. He does it as an escape, as he has seen a lot of shit, and I think he may have some undiagnosed PTSD from various things that he had been through, but he has managed to get very clean for me(as far as I know, but we\u2019ve been intimate and ive seen him, and he tells me when he relapses.) I\u2019ve told him whenever I have big relapses, but Ive had several more than he knows. Learning that he cuts causes me to relapse a little because I care about him so much, and it reminds me of everything that out of my control. I want to get clean for him, but sometimes it all seems fake. He seems too good to be true. When I\u2019m with him I can\u2019t imagine cutting, but as soon as we leave each other, it makes perfect sense. I feel like I\u2019m causing him too much of a burden by telling him whe I relapse. It doesn\u2019t seem as serious as his, and I worry about coming across as somewhat of an attention seeker I guess. I want to know when he relapses, and I want to be there for him, even if it means I might relapse too, but I don\u2019t want to tell him how frequent it\u2019s been because I want him to still feel comfortable talking to me and coming to me if he is hurting. I don\u2019t want him to worry about making me cut, but I don\u2019t know how to tell him without it coming across in a way that would make it seem like me relapsing is his fault and have him close off. Over the past 3 days I\u2019ve cut at 5 times, he knows of one and knows the reasoning being because j reached out to someone who ended up sitting too, and the whole control thing, which isn\u2019t a lie, but isn\u2019t the whole truth. I worry about him and i cope by cutting. He had a bad relapse a couple days ago and it (among other things) has caused me to have this relapse.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I should tell him or not, because I want to be able to share it with him because he is helpful, and I don\u2019t like hiding anything from him. I also don\u2019t want him to become closed off and fall further into darker places (he has tried to commit suicide a couple times, I can\u2019t have him do it again, I need him, I love him) and knowing someone cuts because of you, even if it\u2019s out of care and love (wow how fucked up is that) can\u2019t help your mental state.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Pretty obviously sh.\n\nAnyway, I've been wearing long sleeves despite the warm weather. Today I had a fitness test, but I don't have the long sleeve version of the uniform shirt, so i just wore the uniform sweatshirt over top. The sit ups and push ups were ok, but by the time we got to the cardio, i was sweating bullets. I was so hot that I felt weak and shakey. It was either take off the sweatshirt or risk my career. So i took it off.\n\nPassed the cardio portion alright, but I had to go throw up immediately afterwards. I think i was just nervous and overheated. After Id been in the bathroom for a few minutes, the girl running the test came in to check on me.\n\nNow this girl thinks we're friends, but I don't like her all that much tbh. She just grates on my nerves a little, nothing too serious.

But she couldn't have known if i was lying or not.\n\nShe said \"Im not going to. Ive been there too.\"\n\nThat hurt so much. I dont know why. But i did not want to know that about this girl.

Thanks, SH community.", "author": "needacoldshower", "self_text": "While a lot of people think that these communities can be harmful to participants, it's always been a big help and comfort to me. It's meaningful to me to know that other people go through similar things and that I have a fairly anonymous online space to turn to. \n\nSaturday I ended up buying a new box cutter and set of blades after not being able to access my old one (BF was keeping it). I've been having a hellish time for a very long time now but Friday-Saturday was particularly difficult. Had a pretty emotional talk with BF Saturday night, andddd...I handed over my blades for him to keep them away from me. It is a huge deal. I have *never* willingly given up cutting tools before. It has been a hard thing to do but I guess it's for the best.\n\nI don't remember going through a time in my life previously where I wanted to quit so bad but had so much trouble doing so. I think this is the worst it's ever been but at some point I've got to let go of it forever. I need to teach myself that I can't just keep a clean streak for however many months or years and come back to it; I've got to leave it behind as a solution because it's just *not* anymore. \n\nAnyways the point of all of this is to say thank you to all of you, because reading your posts and talking to you all is really beneficial to me and it's like having a little secret online support system.

I used to have a passion for both now I don't know what I want. I've started cutting again because I've been so anxious and my thoughts just get to me. Docs say I have depression but sometimes I wonder if I'm just lazy and cracked under the pressure. I'm scared about how much I've been self harming. It's not super deep but I feel myself wanting to do more and more damage to get relief and it freaks me out because I don't want to end up in the hospital again. It's just so hard being in school when I'm not as passionate and driven as I was freshman year. It's like I don't even know who I am anymore and I hate this person so much so it's so hard to not self harm. I don't even want to stop anymore. I'm in therapy but it's just not helping. I've never failed anything in college before and even though I don't care anymore, I still kind of do if that makes sense. I don't know what to do. I hope I can make it through the semester without stitches. \n\nThanks in advance to anyone who wastes their time looking at this.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I've thought about self-harming a lot for the past year but always held out because \"the new medicine is going to work.\" Which I now see is a complete and utter lie. So I caved. I'm so pathetic. Was unsuccessful the last couple days because the blades weren't sharp enough and only indented my skin. Today, I took the blade out of a pencil sharpener and did it. Finally. I don't even feel that much better. I mean I definitely do but it's like carrying a 80 pound load instead of 99. Then again the cuts are small. The blade was cheap, though, and I think I got some slivers stuck in my skin. Do you tweeze them out like splinters? I don't know I guess I just came on here bc maybe there's someone on here going through this, too. But realistically I hope no one is. fml", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

And without self-injury, I struggle with all of those things. \n\nThere\u2019s also very little reason to worry. I\u2019m always careful. I cut too deep once, 7 years ago, learned from it, and have made sure to never do that again. My cuts have never gotten infected. I always clean everything up well (in part because I have no idea how to take care of myself emotionally, and bandaging allows me to do that physically). I even use Mederma religiously and my scarring is, all things considered, very mild. Really, my habit of getting drunk to deal with emotions is much more \u201cdangerous\u201d than self-injury- but getting drunk is seen as somewhat socially acceptable, when self-injury often isn\u2019t.\n\nWhy does self-injury seriously upset the people in my life? I explain all of this to them, and they usually just say, \u201cWell, still, how would you feel if I hurt myself\u201d? Of course my heart would break for them and I would rather they not hurt themselves- but I also understand how necessary self-injury can be, how it can be less destructive than other coping mechanisms like drinking yourself into a stupor, and I would still love and accept them.  I just honestly don\u2019t see anything wrong with hurting myself as long as I\u2019m being safe and sane and I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s such a big deal. I understand and don\u2019t judge the people in my life for all sorts of things that I don\u2019t do myself- like smoking, random hook-ups, and illicit drugs, for example- because I try to put myself in their shoes. Is it because self-injury scares them? They can understand wanting to get drunk or have sex, but picking up a blade frightens them, maybe? I don\u2019t know. But it makes me feel like I don\u2019t belong sometimes.\n\nAlso, why does everyone seem to have the expectation that I want to quit self-injuring but somehow just can\u2019t? When I tell people I don\u2019t have any intention to stop self-injuring, they\u2019re always shocked and upset. While I don\u2019t enjoy self-injury, it works for me and I\u2019m content. Again, everyone brushes it off and tells me I must just be \u2018addicted to self-injury\u2019 and that one day I\u2019ll be able to quit, but that\u2019s not the case.\n\nAll of this is part of why I usually don\u2019t let people know (and because I don\u2019t want them to worry about me).\n\nHave any of you dealt with similar reactions from the people in your lives? How did you handle it? Or any other thoughts you have on the matter!", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Well basically today my friends were being a bit rude because they saw in phys ed that i had practically covered my right forearm with red marks. They were all shouting at me because I went away from them at lunch to read outside on a bench and they all followed me and they were mad. As they were shouting, my tutor came over and he asked why we were all shouting. Nearly all my friends were quiet and just tried to make up an excuse at we were just arguing over a rule in a video game because obviously they didn't want to out my problem to him. But then this other girl was just like 'oh sir we are arguing because (my name) has been cutting herself up AGAIN' and he just looked shocked and he looked at me as if to say what is she going on about but i think he could tell from the look on my face and because i was crying at this was true. He ended up asking me to follow him and whilst all my friends stood in our usual corner he took me to his classroom and got somebody to quickly cover his lunch time duty shift. He sat me down and of course i was crying because i was scared for him to tell my mom but he just looked really concerned. he started talking to me about how he kind of noticed since the beginning of the new school year and when he just became my tutor at he always thought something was troubling me but he couldn't figure out what it was. He then asked me to show him my arm and I didn't want to at first but because I kind of trust him as I have to see him everyday for tutor and he's really nice I showed him and he told me he would have to tell the guidance counselor as it is his job as a mandated reporter (i think that's the phrase) and he has to tell because he'll get in trouble if I killed myself. I said it was fine because I already knew at as I have read stuff on here about that. He then just asked me a bunch of questions and he was really understanding and sometimes i answered in dark humour because thats just what i do and he looked a bit confused and i told him thats kind of how i cope with depression and stuff, with humour, and he let me carry on. he then took me to my next lesson and explained to my teacher at i was with him so i wasn't late and this was english and my english teacher is really nice aswell and he said he would email her explaining what was happening because he didn't want to announce to the whole class why i was late. The rest of the school  found out because my friends told everyone  and idk what to do about this whole crazy situation. My mom will probably be mad at me for self harming because she says my life is good and i shouldn't have a reason to be sad most of the time when i am. And i kind of feel bad because me tutor looked really sad when i showed him my cuts and i don't want to make him sad because he's usually so happy and seeing him like at made me feel really guilty for cutting. :(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nif anybody has any advice or stories of their own please share them with me because i'm new to reddit and maybe i can find some friends here on my sad posts lol. :D", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I\u2019ve just never seen this idea anywhere (I\u2019ve tried all sorts of other alternatives that never helped like holding ice/ rubber bands/ cold showers/ etc.), and it\u2019s been really helpful and a creative solution for me personally. I discovered it by trying a low temperature burn candle in my own bedroom life and didn\u2019t like it for its intended purpose, but found the feeling was similar to SI (without the long-term damage) and it\u2019s helped me so, so much. \n\nI\u2019d say the only downsides are 1. You have to wait until enough wax has melted to use it. Since it\u2019s a low burn temperature, it happens quicker than most candles, but it still takes some time and isn\u2019t available immediately like some SI forms 2. It does require an open flame. Some people may not be comfortable with having an open flame or keeping a lighter to light one, and some apartment complexes/ dorms forbid open flames. 3. It\u2019s often very clear what it is, and while you can peel the label sticker off and then it just looks like a regular candle, it still may not be discrete enough (like my roommate asking why I have a \u201ckink candle\u201d was a little awkward, for instance). For me, however, the downsides are all definitely worth it, but just wanted to give a fair warning! \n\nFeel free to ask me any questions! Stay safe. Lots of luck and love. \u2764\ufe0f", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I told her that I understand and that I used to have similar coping mechanisms. She wants to stop but really has trouble.\n\nFor a few months when we started dating, her self harm was a very occasional thing. She would tell me what she did afterward and she seemed very ashamed and apologetic. I would tell her I was there to support her and also remind her of her friends who want to be supportive that she can talk to. I made sure she was going to her therapist regularly and being honest. This went on for some time.\n\nRecently, she has been cutting more frequently and I've noticed that the cuts are deeper. I know that she has heightened stress right now (which is probably the explanation), but I still want to do more. I don't want to be selfish or make her change just because of how it affects me, but it's really hard for me to see what she does to herself and it makes me feel like I'm not doing enough to help her.\n\nIt's getting hard for me to say that I understand. My words aren't doing anything. I feel like saying \"I'm here to support you\" does nothing to actually support her. She doesn't ask for help or tell me that she needs anything.

I was only 3 when I already knew he could die and was so afraid of losing him I never left his side.  \nWe ended up moving around a lot to go to the better doctors for his treatment. This caused me to never make friends and have a hard time in school on top of learning disabilities. This caused me to never really like school and it later caused problems in high school getting me expelled at one point. back on track with my father and his cancer. we moved a total of 4 times through out my 'child hood'. which might not seem like a lot but I was never in a school for more then 2 years before we moved till middle school when we stayed in one place because he had beat his cancer. Well it ended up coming back a few times and each time he had to go to surgery my anxiety went nuts. Not much else to tell about that part so we are going to step back to me getting expelled from high school.  \n\n\nWhen I was expelled from high school It was for protecting my sister and getting in the principals face for allowing someone to tell her to end her life because no one cared about her. more then once I bought up that she was being bullied and they did nothing. So this caused me to get pissed and I blew up. The police came to my house and searched it while holding me on the couch. they where looking for weapons because they thought I was going to shoot the school up or something. clearly not the case but the principal was a pussy. I was expelled and was unable to return to school till I have an psychiatric evaluation done. 4 months later I was diagnosed with depression.  \nReturning to school was stressful because I had to make up everything I missed on top of what I already had to do and I don't handle stress well.   \n\n\nNext big step is when I was working as a bus monitor on a school bus with special needs kids. I loved my job so nothing wrong there. But I meet someone and she lived in another state. long story short I ended up moving out there with her getting a job car all that jazz. Well it didn't work out and I was left homeless and my car didn't make it so I was left with nothing at all and forced to make my way back home with my parents. This entire ordeal destroyed me and left me feeling lifeless. I was afraid to feel anything and for awhile just felt numb to the world around me.  \nshit was starting to get worse at home and A friend offered me a place in Arizona. The gesture was a nice gesture but it had ulterior motives behind it which I soon bound out. making me feel even worse and not having a  room or anything drove me crazy. I left my family a decent job and the little friends I had while unstable to move to a new place to have nothing. I was ignored, made to feel like shit and like I upset people around me and worst of all left alone in a quite house to let my mind wander. I ended up starting to self harm I was so upset. I cut myself over 34 times, counting each cut I took. I ended up starting to see shit like cats out of the corner of my eye or people standing in doorways that where not there. I had a break down and my cousin from a state over came to send me back home to my family.\n\nI have been a bit better since then and only cut maybe 3 times but its been 2 weeks since I last cut and I'm afraid to relapse and repeat it all. so much goes on in my head at any one given time.  \n\n\nI knot this is kind of a mess but its more so me just venting and throwing everything running through my head out there.  \nIf you take the time to read it all you're awesome and thank you.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Either way it's probably a good thing. I was looking at my scars today and they've started to fade, despite the fact that a few weeks ago they looks huge and very obvious. This should be a good thing because the effort I put in to hiding them has been stressful but when I was staring at them I couldn't help but feel disappointed that they started to fade. As if I'd be losing any thing I had to show for what I was going through when I made them. Then I felt annoyed at myself for having such a weird reaction to it, as if I'm upset that I won't get to show them off to someone at some point in my life when I've overcome my depression and feel comfortable sharing it, like they were some trophy I got for being so depressed that I self harmed, I was worried I'd lose that. Makes me wanna cut more and even deeper so that they'll stay but I realise that is such a stupid thought process to have. I dunno. It's confusing.

I can't talk right now. \n\n&gt;But I can't get out of my mind your excuse about us both having \"self control issues.\" That comment really really hurt me and I'm only texting you about it because I woke up from a nightmare about that conversation and it's just sitting there and rotting in my head.\n\n&gt;[EX], I use and have used self harm as a coping mechanism to deal with suicidal thoughts. It distracts me, I like the feeling and the sight of my blood in a sick kind of way. It leaves you with a rush of endorphins afterwards acting like a high. The high really just = not feeling like udder shit for a short while. \n\n&gt;It's an addiction. I was addicted before I met you, and I struggled so badly with getting clean. I was seperated from you once and relapsed because I was in such emotional distress. You made me promise not to do it again, and you know what?\n\n&gt;I didn't do it. Not even after years of relying on it, not after the near nightly urges. You told me to tell you if I get the urge and I'd find any excuse to call you because I was determined to stay clean because it hurt you and I loved you too much to do it again. \n\n&gt;Don't ever compare my struggles to your actions. You have complete control over your body and your choices. You have a brain, and I thought you also had a heart. Thought. \n\n&gt;When I relapsed it wasn't just an urge to SH that was just \"too good to resist\" it was pure desperation because I was having a break down. It was survive and self harm or face the consuming insecurities that I'll never be enough for you (my fears at the time) and that I'm worthless and replaceable and I should just take my life. These feelings were then reaffirmed in our conversation, and that's why I broke down so badly. \n\n&gt;I was already battling for days and nights because I promised to my then love that I'd make sure I was okay. Self harm was a last resort. I felt so ashamed and guilty. It brought me so much pain, and at times I was in a mild psychosis. I had hallucinations and frequently passed out because of days without sleep and it caused my mind to become confused and terrfied. Even then, the self harm that took place that day I did because I was desperate. I needed to be in control of th situation when I felt like I had lost my mind. \n\n&gt;[EX], you fucked me over and there is no excuse. I know you are sexual, and I know it can be a lot for you but I also know something else. You can stop. When I'd say \"no\" or our safeword you would stop. You stopped back then because you cared for and respected me. \n\n&gt;You knew it was cheating. You knew that it would break my heart beyond repair to be betrayed like that. You did it anyway. \n\n&gt;You had every control to not do what you did. You could think for a moment \"this will really hurt [ME], he loves and trusts me, I shouldn't.\"\n\n&gt;And if you did think that and did it anyway you have even less of an excuse. \n\n&gt;Your not selfish for leaving me, you are selfish for betraying me. For being a cheater. For not giving me even an ounce of pity or care to even break up to me to my face. You are selfish for your caring being conditional because I was being \"rude\" when I was in tears and under so much pain and stress. \n\n&gt;You and I are nothing alike in this regard. I gave my everything to give up years of addiction for you because I knew it hurt you. I gave it up for YEARS.\n\n&gt;You didn't even care enough to last a week. \n\n&gt;And that doesn't even make me angry, it just makes my heart hurt. It makes it hurt more that you'd also point out a huge personal struggle of mine and compare yourself to it. To excuse your actions. \n\n&gt;I shouldn't be talking to you because right now I'm in pain and I can't handle it. But you need to know.\n\n&gt;You are wrong.

It was like I was there just to prove to myself that I wanted it, but I still didn't.\n\nSo I drove home afterward, figuratively beating myself up for not trying something that could have helped me, and mildly burning my fingers with hot air from the climate control all the way home. Once I got there, I thought I'd sharpen my pocket knife as a form of meditation to get out of my head (it's worked before, but bad idea in hindsight, I know). I didn't think I was in the mood to cut myself (the mild burning should've told me otherwise), but I thought it would help calm me down and center myself. Obviously that didn't work.\n\nI took a shower to try to calm down, but you can guess how it ended; now I've got two slashes down my shoulder from the recently honed pocket knife that was in the pants pocket lying on the floor outside my shower, and I can't be sure I won't add onto them again in the near future.\n\nI don't really know what I'm looking for right now.

So my stupid brain decided that, for two weeks, it\u2019d be a good idea to suggest a session in the bathroom, where I can clean up easily, lock the door, and take my time as nobody would be home. \n\nYeah that went to shit. Blood everywhere (walls, floor, on the shower curtains?) and when I went to grab something off the side, I instead picked up my box of razors so round two happened. Needless to say my entire body is sore. \n\nI crashed big time after this. The adrenaline rush saw me through the last of clean up and cleaning myself up, and then I could barely stand. So I\u2019ve felt even worse since (so bad I\u2019m tempted for a third round). Going to bed was shit, because apparently my brother didn\u2019t want to stop playing his Xbox. So he got angry, there was a fight between him and mother. She walked away and he told her to fuck off. He treats her like shit and apparently I wasn\u2019t standing for it tonight and told him to stop acting like an ass. That was the wrong thing to do, as he decided to punch my door again, so now he\u2019s broke through to the other side. Another punch and he\u2019ll break right through. (He has severe anger issues; he\u2019s broken my door, his first door, and his second door. At our old house he also broke his wardrobe, and used said door to gouge holes out of the wall there. He\u2019s trashed shelves, tables and chests of draws). Which wasn\u2019t helpful because he sent me straight back into that shaky, anxious state. \n\nI had my BJD on my bed (for those who don\u2019t know, BJD stands for ball jointed doll; they\u2019re really pretty, but expensive. I saved up for ages to get mine, but she\u2019s perfect) so I sat with her and combed her wig out because it was messy and hugged her for a bit. And then I grabbed my American Girl dolls and brushed their hair out and popped them back on their shelf, and then I grabbed my My Little Ponies (80\u2019s ones; I don\u2019t display my new ones anymore. I like the 80\u2019s ones better), and brushed them for a bit. It was pretty calming, to be honest. I made my ponies talk to each other, and I spoke to my BJD the entire way through. Retreating to a more childlike state was really quite soothing and I feel better than I did. And everyone looks neat and tidy again, so that\u2019s a bonus. I know it sounds dumb, but it did seem to work for me tonight. It isn\u2019t something that always works, but it did tonight, so I\u2019m hoping I don\u2019t do anything else today. It\u2019s also nice to care for someone, you know? I can\u2019t care for myself, but my BJD is almost an extension of me (it sounds dumb, but she has a personality. I project a lot onto her I suppose, mostly because it\u2019s easier to care for her than myself. So if I\u2019m panicking I can tell myself it\u2019s her, not me, and I talk her down as if she\u2019s real, when actually I\u2019m Tricking My Brain and actually talking myself down instead. It\u2019s complicated, dumb and childish but it works so I\u2019m not arguing). \n\nI\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m sharing this, but I am. Maybe someone would be able to relate. Maybe not.

I think it might be because I\u2019m not feeling feelings of self hatred, but just of sadness. And when I would cut, it would kinda be my own way of saying \u201chey I\u2019m messed up right now.\u201d \n\nWhich brings me to my point, is it fake to cut and be open about my scars and such when I haven\u2019t been struggling with self harm for that long? When I first started, I would wear shorts around my friends without a second thought because I didn\u2019t really care that they knew, but I tried to hide them from my mom for a month or two. And sometimes I cut and look at myself in the mirror and think they look good? Like my messed up head thinks that I look better when I\u2019ve mutilated myself. \nBut yeah, I don\u2019t know, I just seem really fake not having been shameful of them to people (other than my parents or family) because I feel like self harm is something you have to hide and if you don\u2019t hide it you\u2019re just attention seeking and fake.

{"post_id": "biiu8t", "created_utc": 1556502594, "title": "Need some advice", "author": "clockworkstudent", "self_text": "Warning, lots of text ahead!\n\nTLDR: Tried to cut myself for the first time yesterday, didn't have a sharp knife so the wound was barely a wound, don't know if I should tell someone (such as my school counsellor). I want help, but I don't want my parents or teachers to be told.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi everyone, just to introduce myself, I'm a 16 year old high school student and I've only recently discovered this sub-reddit.\n\nUp until recently, I've always considered myself to be very mentally healthy. I've never done anything to hurt myself before, until yesterday when I thought it would help. Long story short, I felt really guilty last night because I felt like I'd wasted the whole day I should have spent studying, so I tried to cut my shoulder, but the blade was too dull. I tried to slice the same spot a few more times, but I wasn't brave enough to push down hard and in the end there was barely any blood.\n\nI felt like I'd failed to even cut myself, and felt even worse. It didn't even hurt when I showered afterward, or when I move my arm. It makes me feel really useless and guilty, because as I'd said earlier, I feel like I can't even cut myself properly. \n\nI'm a little scared that I might hurt myself more in the future, even though I don't feel any SH urges right now. I also don't know if I have some sort of depressive problem, and whether if I have a mood disorder or if I'm going through a depressive episode. I've tried doing research and online tests, and I know I fit a few of the criteria, but I worry that I may be over-exaggerating my symptoms. My poor mental health is sometimes debilitating (though only on the bad days, and not to the point where I can't get out of bed), and I want help. I've spoken to my school counsellor, but I'm really worried that she'll tell my parents if I tell her about my self harm (attempt). I'm afraid I might come across as attention seeking (which I guess I am to the degree that I want help). I've considered just taking a few of my mom's antidepressants, but research says they make take a few weeks to work and I can't take that many pills without her noticing.\n\nI also believe I may be slightly emotionally repressed. I really hate showing any sort of negative emotion to anyone (especially crying), because I think it makes me look weak. I know objectively that crying isn't a sign of weakness, but in the moment I can't stop the shame and the embarrassment, hence why I do my best to suppress any of that unless I'm alone. Unfortunately this includes my counsellor \u2013 the last time I saw her I was really struggling, but I really didn't want to cry in front of her, so I just redirected topics to things that I knew wouldn't make me emotional.\n\nI've never tried to self harm before, but I am a compulsive scab picker. If I don't pick at my scabs I'll feel really uncomfortable and fidgety. Even if I don't have scabs, I'll pick at my skin until new ones form. I've been trying to do research but I'm not sure this counts as SH, since I don't do it with the intention of causing myself pain \u2013\u00a0it's just something that I feel like I have to do to relieve myself.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the rant, and if you're still here, I really appreciate it. The entire reason for this post is because I want advice \u2013 should I tell someone, such as my school counsellor about how I've been feeling (about the possibly-depression and almost-self harm)? I'm scared it may make things worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel a little guilty that I'm here because I'm not really a self harmer, but I'd still like to take this chance to say that to any one of you who's struggling right now, I hope you're okay and that you feel better soon. I know a lot of people say this, but please DM me if you would like to talk, especially if you're a student \u2013 I understand your struggle!", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I've had a couple years of self-harm but the most severe ones were actually the ones I loved the most (on my chest). There's something about feeling the bumps and valleys that I like. I'm not ashamed of them either. I've kept the recent cuts hidden of course because I can't alarm my managers or fellow students at work.

I guess I think about how they (the scars) came to be but I don't necessarily *love* them for that reason. \n\nI like the feeling of the bumps and I want more in the form of art on my back or somewhere else. I actually hate the look of scars on the arm. They're a bit offputting in my opinion. I cut on my arm sometimes but quite lightly, only when I'm frustrated. The ones on my chest were the ones I could cut the deepest and create hypertrophic scars. But during that time, my self-esteem and mood was in a really bad state.\n\nSeems as if every time I get really low, it's like a chance to cut even deeper to get the same scar formation but of course, they never turn out like they did before. I'm also not in that state anymore, there's no point in trying to cut deeper if I can't even handle it. Which is why I was thinking about scarification. \n\nThere's something about being touched there that makes me feel really nice. I feel content and safe when someone touches the scars on my chest.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I act like I have two sides: one that only wants to watch my favourite series and be with the girl I love and be happy in general, and another one, that wants to continue to cut myself or self-harm in another way. \n\nI feel reaped. That's the only way to describe it. I want to cut so badly, but.. my parents made me stop, what if they discovered that I relapsed again? And.. maybe I should try to live on happily? Forget about everything from my past - the self harm, the suicidal thoughts, the fights with my parents... I am improving and I fight less with my parents, why start to worse everything again...?\n\nBut the thing is, I can't forget. Everyday, I think about what should I do about this mess. I wake up in the morning and think, \"so should I cut myself or not?\" I go to school and on my way I think, \"I can stop in the pharmacy after school and get a few bandages. I can start it all again. It was my plan ever since I got caught by my parents. Why not do it again? It helped me to calm down, I could take my anger on myself in a way that would hurt me and me alone, because I deserve this but the people around me do not.\n\nIt clamed down for a bit a few days ago without me having to harm myself to stop these thoughts. I thought that I could finally live on. Of course, it still bothered me. But a lot less, and it was a relief.\n\nUntil clever me researched a book from a series I watched. It was called, \"the complete manual of suicide\". I found it, was amused that it actually exists, and I thought that I'll be done with it researching suicide but nope. Last night I couldn't sleep, so I started to count the ways you can kill yourself that I know. But now I know more about methods of suicide than these 14 I counted last night, because I read about it all day in school - the methods, of course, but only that - statistics of suicide, things to consider before killing yourself.. and that's only one site. I opened endless tabs of several sites like Wikipedia and Quora, everything full of information about commiting suicide. \n\nThen a thought came. \n\n\"Do I want to kill myself?\"\n\nNo, of course I don't. I don't have a reason, and my life is fine right now.. not completely, I am still severly broken, but I'm a lot better... I'd understand if I wanted to kill myself when I was still self harming. But I don't anymore. Why would I do this? \n\n\"Well, I don't see a way to answer the question if I should self harm in a way that would be completely fine about me.. maybe killing myself will be a solution.\" \n\nBut.. no... it's not a good enough reason. I have things in my life that I don't want to lose, like my crush. And I do have people who are close to me, and even though this number is very small, like 1 person, there is my family, and they woukd be shocked for sure. What would my parents do? Hate me for that probably.. and my brother? Well, he never hugged me or sajd he loves me, and it seems like he's irritated by everything I tell him, so he probably won't even shed a tear. How my classmates would react? They will all probably be like, \"good thing that she's gone, we all never talked to her anyways.\" And the \"friends\" that were ignoring me most of the time I was hanging out with them? They will say, \"you know, she cutted herself.\" And be done with thinking about me. \n\nBut... I have my life. I want to experince things, like kissing, that have not occoured in my life yet, and also - I have my crush who right now is my only friend, I have my favorite series to watch, music to listen to, even... a watermelon in the fridge to eat! Part of me wants to be alive and be happy, but on the other hand - do I even deserve to be happy? Perhaps I should cut myself and be sad. And maybe even end my life.\n\nI know that for people that want to kill themselves because of better reasons will laugh at me and say that I don't know what I'm talking about, but... I do. And I want to do several things ti kill myself that I won't mengion because lf the rules, I WANT TO COMMIT SUICIDE. But... I really do..? Ugh, I DON'T KNOW.\n\n\n\n\n\nI know this post is about both self harm and suicide but I didn't want to post it on r/suicidewatch because it was kind of about self harm too and I'm more familiar with this subreddit.

In addition, my brother who is 5 years older than me used to beat me up regularly since i was like 8yo all the way to 14yo. We still live together with but we haven't talked for 6 years now. Anyway the aftermath of that is that I've always been fearful of physical contact, and even now when someone does a quick, rough or unforeseen move near me i think he/she is going to hit me and i freak out and protect myself. So I've always been very shy and fearful toward social interaction and contact. Until when i was 14 i was in a holiday camp and there was a girl i didn't really interact with but she spent quite some time with one of my best friend there so maybe that altered the things a bit, and the last day she caught me off guard and hugged me and i was really dazed but in one way i feel like I've been craving this for a long time. \n\nAnyway i got back in my shy and introvert life until 3 years later (a bit less than 3 years ago) i spent a afternoon with one of with friend and some of his friends i didn't really knew. At the end i got hugged by 2 girl friends of him and again i feel extreme relief. One of the girl i ended up talking with her and fell in love but that is a long and complicated story. After that i started feeling worse and worse because my demons caught me and i and to choose my college so i was stressed out and i \"tried\" self harming (cutting) out of curiosity because i needed a way to feel better (i was 2 years ago). Quickly i developed my addiction which I'm still in and tried to understand the reasons why i cut and i figured out there was several of them but one of the main one was because i was craving for physical affection so much and the closest thing i could get from a hug was doing the exact opposite, cutting myself open and feel the blood running down my skin. Anyway i keep doing that and my last hug was still 3 years ago and ain't close of getting another one. \n\nI just wanted to get that out and if anyone felt something like this, thank you from reading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR I have a huge affective lack and use cutting as a substitute for physical affection.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Just I can't talk about my innermost feelings, the ones that have been completely ruining my life for the past few years of high school. I just don't fucking know a. HOW yo talk about them or b. WHEN/WHO to talk them. how it cones naturally for people to \"oh i have to leave school for the day because i forgot my earbuds and i have anxiety\", i'm fucking jealous cus I'd like any help whatsoever. Weather it be me having a breakdown quietly in my room or having a shit day everywhere, there's always something that I dismiss and just deal with it. Well that was fine and dandy, but it's done a few bad things that I really need help with but CAN'T GET RESOLVED. \n1. School. My grades just dropped like a rock halfway through freshman year and they've stayed low (I'm in junior year for reference). My parents don't give two shits if I graduate or not, and the way things are going I'm probably gonna have to spend another year in high school. Nobody wants to take the first step for me, and I just can't fucking bring myself to speak with anyone about it. Just joking with my BFF about my trash grades and getting angry at her when she says shit like \"omg it'll be so weird when im in college and you'll still be here\". like. i'm about ready to become a traunt if i have to deal with that alongside the stresses of staying at school when i'm so bad I can't even read full sentences or am having major bad feels and staring at my phone is the only thing keeping me from.... well it's not keeping me from doing anything, I'm still gonna sit my ass in that chair and take all of it without any clue how to make it better if i don't have my phone to stare at it. Worst part is i don't even know what words to use to describe that feeling that school puts me in so I can't say \"sxhool makes me feel like x\" (and either way that'd always be dismissef as \"ph i dont like school\") WELL FUCK. fuck...\n2. I'm really fucking angry around everyone else. I play the smash bros., and I attend tournaments regularly. Which sounds dandy, but I'm always super salty and am really agressive towards others (and no matter how much I try to fucking control myself, I can't. Feels like I'm powerless to change this at all.). I've been considered for bans since 2017, but yesterday someone forfeit the set because they were afraid I was gonna continue my salty shit and break my controller again. For everyone else's sake, I hope I stick to my word and never attend a tournament again. \n3. FUCK MY FAMILY. not alabama style. \n\nAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\nFuck\nI have been trying to fix myself using online resources, but a. idk always what the problem/fix is,\nb. it can be really hard to stay motivated when i'm the only thing motivating myself and my mood is swinging left right and center like, let's play a game, let's see if we can go 2 hours without having a fucking breakdown (no not one you dance to)\nAnd fucking c. it doesn't fucking WORK\nAHHHHHHHHHH\n\nI CAN'T FUCKING TALK TO ANYONE ABOUT IT AND THEREFORE I CAN'T USE PEOPLE TO TRY AND HELP, INSTEAD I'M THE SALTY VILLAN AND DESERVE THE BAD SHIT/AM MAKING IT UP BECAUSE I WON'T DO THE OBVIOUS ANSWER TO IT, TALK ABOUT IT....\n\nwhy can't I talk about it?\ngood question. Well.... my parents are always angry about something. idk. They don't pay attention to me, and we can go months without any meaningful conversation. well ok. Also that speaking to my mother is the most nerve-wracking thing. I refuse to even walk diwn the stairs while she's awake because I'm so fucking afraid she'll hear. And whenenever she makes any comment to me, it kinda destroys my mood. idk why it's like this, but it is what it is. \nAnd her boyfriend that lives with us I feel the sane way about. \nMy father I see about as often as I speak with my mother - I saw him last week and before that it was January. I'm not gonna ruin what little time I have with em with \"hey my life sucks\" (plus i wouldn't know HOW or WHEN to speak with em about it). \n\nI'm not close at all to my family..\n\ni'm also not close enough with any friends to talk about hiw I'm about ready to intentionally get caught doing something real bad (cus I have urges to destroy my life... well i've already done that, but even more lol.)\n\nOh I guess this is a self harm sub so i should post the links too lol. \n\n\nI've been cutting since 8th grade (after mother's and step-fatger's divorce, 2nd I've had to be around for in my span). I've never once been caught. Nobody's seen my scars (cus I'm a thigh cutter mostly) except formor cowworkers when I forgot to wear sleeves without designs on em. It's so fucking easy to hide em. Jeans and a long sleeve, and thanks to my heat tolerance (I'm tolerant to about everything that isn't drugs), i go about my days just ok. \n\nOh yeah.... fucking ruined my career at a fucking fast food job. If I wasn't already bad enough, whenever thibgs would get at all stressful (or it happens when i have too much fun too), i'd jump out of my body and I'd essentially be on a shitty autopilot. Made hours go by real fast, but it sucked ass for all of it. fuxk. fuck. \n\nI just want to get better... IDK HOW TO!!!!!! \n\noh yeah... i should mention I sent my mother a text and it said something along the lines \"interacting with ya is the most nerve wracking thing\" and she said to me \"you made me feel like i've fucked up as a parent and that my kid hates me forever\".... in addition to ruining my mood from speaking to me, you also made me feel guilty af and want to slice up my thighs. i know im a dumb asshole already, please don't confirm it for me...\n\n\nfuckfuckfuck\nI'm fucking screwed, probably gonna wind up working a shit job and living in my car with no social life aside workworkwork. I might invest in one of those helium exit kits, but I damn well know I'm never gonna use it no matter how bad it gets - because I'm making it all up cus I won't try to make it better. Yeah. That's it. \n\nfuck.\nI probably missed a lot of shit. I'm not satisfied. That's ok. I'll deal with being unsatisfied as I do everything else in life. I'll just take it. The feeling'll pass.

He even compared me with his stupid fucking father, my grandfather who was essentially disowned by his family.  I also ran into two people from that toxic group that really set me off on the wrong path this morning.  Seeing them makes me feel like puking on sight.

My mom got mad at me for doing that, and even though she's been really nice and understanding for the past month or so (I have a lot of depression and anxiety), she all of a sudden turned on me and told me that I was the reason that the family was going into debt and that I needed to be more willing to do things around the house. The conversation made me anxious and I almost threw up, but when I told her that I didn't want to eat the dinner that had been made because I was nauseous, she told me to stop being so manipulative and ungrateful. She kept telling me that I'm ruining the family because going to therapy isn't working, and that even though I told her I have a very hard time opening up to people, she said it was that I just didn't want to get better. She know about my history of self harm, but not my recent relapse, which I won't ever tell her, but she said that I self harmed because I wanted to hurt her, and that the only reason I've ever done it is to make her hurt and show her that I'm not okay.\n\nI feel like shit and I'm going to cut, and there's nothing anyone can do to stop me. I'm also feeling the most suicidal I've felt in a long time and even though I probably won't kill myself, I wouldn't mind if I died right now. I just want everything to stop. I don't have the balls to kill myself though. I've been so numb for so long and cutting is the only thing that helps it. Fuck. I don't even know that I want to get better anymore. My life is already completely screwed up and I don't think there's anything else I can do to make it worse. \n\nSorry for the long rant.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}
