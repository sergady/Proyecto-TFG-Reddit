I'm 19 and I'm working hard to get my life on track. Recently, I drank an entire bottle of vodka and ended up slicing my entire forearm. Like 10 cuts, and when they saw me it was just blood trickling down the whole of my arm. After a bunch of events I don't even recall, a ton of my family and friends ended up surrounding me at one point. I was blacked out from before it happened until the next day basically (from drinking nearly an entire bottle of grey goose in my room). I do have a few random memories from the night, so I guess the stress made me sober up at certain points. Basically it was the worst night of my life. I just have these random memories from that night like being put in a car and driven away or just looking up and seeing a bunch of people I know circled around me looking at me like I was a monster. I have this sense of \"they all know now\" every time I see any of them. I don't even know how it fucking happened, which makes it worse I fucking used to black out at least once a week and do dumb embarrassing shit and be over it but this is an entire different level. It's like I got possessed and lost my shit and my best friend said I sent him a picture of my arm to him on snap so he contacted some of my family members to come over, I guess it was bad. I had an episode like this where I slashed longways up and down my arm the exact same time last year. It doesn't help that my mom also has had to go to help facilities for the same mental shit and then also self harming, so now it looks like I'm the one child who gets to have her issues passed down. This whole thing happening didn't make me more sad or more anxious (it only did for the first week or so), it just makes me constantly uncomfortable. The insane thing is that for someone who rarely cuts it's fucking mortifying to have your closest friends and family all surround you and stare at you when it happens. Every time I have an episode I don't even know until it's over. I remember this time I grabbed the knife I've always used and laughed thinking \"holy shit I remember this thing\" and hating the idea of it. Next thing I know I'm already making little slices. Little slices over weeks, over Christmas. Eventually it's real cuts again, and the rest is history. It always comes back to you, and alcohol is its friend. \n\nThe shittiest part is I remember being a little 8th grader, crying and then experiencing the first little cut into myself, continuing until I was scared enough to stop. Not even long after I remember being with my little \"emo\" friend and listing to music that was romanticizing the idea of self harm. It seemed okay or maybe even cool to hurt myself in such an extreme way, I guess \"edgy\" would be the term. In reality it was only a downward slope to disassociation and further mental damage. Listen, I'm not a god damn mental health expert I'm just venting my past shit.\n\nI don't drink nearly as much anymore. At the time it happened I was getting drunk like 5 days a week, not even phased by the hangovers on the way to work. It's insanely awkward when I'm obviously hiding scars around the people I know very well, and I hope they don't see me as a cutter or something because what the fuck none of them have any idea what it is I guess? One of my closest friends in my life must've told his dad (I know his father well and we've always had sort of a friendship but we joke in a sarcastic way like he'll say shit like \"alright get the fuck outta my house\" when me and my friends are over. He's sort of jokingly Red Forman from That 70's Show). When I was leaving my friends house he was in the garage and told me to come sit. He spoke to me how we usually do, a little harsh but in a loving manner. It was entirely him speaking and he talked about depression and anxiety in a very visceral way, no dramatic bullshit. It meant an insane amount to me whether he knew it or not. The only problem is I've always known this guy, I'm over my buddy's house all the time and I joke with his dad, but fuck I hope it isn't any different now because of this shit. I'm always normal as fuck around everyone and I genuinely am a normal person are they going to think I'm fucked up now or something? Is my dad going to change the way he thinks about me or the things he says to me? Like fuck dude he's my dad we've always been close and it's insane to think that something fucking stupid like this is even a thing that he thinks about. I'm trying my best to just do everything like normal because that's how I feel it should be but I have no idea if they are getting over it or not. The biggest issue is my sister and my dad because they were both there with everyone else when I was blackout drunk and bloody. I distinctly remember the look on their faces and I can see it in my head at random moments when I'm trying to fall asleep.

When you are ready to change, you will look at it as a point in the present moment that is subject to change in the future. In other words, which was taught to me by a heroin addict:\n\nYou must learn to be in the present moment. The present moment is filled with emotions- self hatred, self destructive impulses, and other negative emotions. The goal is to set a new goal for yourself. That goal is to be alright with not knowing the next time to self harm will be. That means not imposing \u201cnever\u201d into your life. \u201cNever\u201d is a word that has a lot of bearings on yourself and can be proven wrong, given any life circumstance. Someone could make fun of you, you could make fun of yourself, you\u2019ll remember that bad memory and have no other way to cope. In other words, you\u2019ll find a way to hurt yourself once more. Cope by learning to direct anger outward, by turning aggressive impulses not at yourself, but at symbolic substitutes. Who made you mad? It\u2019s so hard to find this out. It\u2019s so hard to know your body, to know what\nYou\u2019re feeling. You feel so split and hateful to yourself, your nature. But that must be overcome. You must find a will to survive for yourself, to care for yourself. What emotion are you feeling and how can you hit something or let out your feelings so that not a single person gets hurt?\n\nBut the best thing to do in the situation, if stopping it is your goal, is to be in the present. You never know if you\u2019ll hurt yourself again after the time you just did or the time you just didn\u2019t. \n\nBut promise yourself this. This is my axiom of truth:\n\nIn this moment, right here in *THIS* present moment, I will not hurt myself. I\u2019m not sure if I will do it tomorrow, or next week. But right now, regardless of how I feel, I will not do it. I could not help myself before. But now I will do what I can for myself.\n\n\nI hope I could help yourself.\n\nWith love and admiration to you,\nXS", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

This is not in any way meant to be insensitive, I know the struggle and I've been in a similar situation that cause my mental health to deteriorate badly.*\n\nThis is about my sister.\n\nShe's 15, 4 years younger than me. My sister has a friend. That friend cuts herself, badly. This puts a lot of strain on my sister, because she's often the one that her friend texts when she's done it again. My mother and I have been trying to help her as best we can, by telling her to take some distance if she needs it - because no one should deal with something like this when they're 15. I did as well, and looking back that whole situation has damaged me. I wish I could get her away from it and undo it all, but I can't. \n\nToday, when I got back from grocery shopping with my dad he got a call. It was my sister, she was crying and told him she was on her way to her friend, who had cut herself quite badly. My dad told her he was coming and I said I was going with him. My dad isn't great with blood and injuries, so I thought it best to come, for both him and my sister. My mom quickly pushed some gauze and bandages in my pockets and off we were. \n\nWe arrived and went upstairs. My sister's friend was in her room, a small pool of blood on the ground and a large gash in her arm. I asked her if I could take a look, told my dad she needed stitches and started unloading my gauze and bandaids. I tried my best to close the gash a bit and cover it up so she could move around without it bleeding or tearing. While doing this, my sister was calming her down and telling her it was okay, we were here to help. we cleaned up the blood and waited for my dad to return with the car so he could drive them to the doctor's. I went home.\n\nThe thoughts that went through my head? First off, \"I should take off my scarf so it doesn't get ruined\". When going back home, \"why is this the reality my sister is living in? why is her friend hurting her like this?\"\n\nIt's not fair. It's not fair to burden the people around you like this. You need to get help. I know you're in pain, but think about the damage you're doing to other people. My sister has shed a lot of tears because of this. She's been seeing a therapist recently because her own mental health has declined.\n\nThere's a big difference between sharing your pain and almost forcing people to participate in it. When you tell someone \"I cut myself\" they can't back out. They can't say \"I'm sorry, that sucks\". At least my sister can't. I couldn't either.\n\nI don't mean this to be insensitive, but please, please, don't be like my sister's friend. Get professional help. Expecting the people around you, that care about you, to be your therapist and saviour will give them an experience they'll want to, but will never be able to forget.\n\nThanks for reading.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Should I tell them that, \"hey, I've been awfully stressed lately and I've been self harming,\" or should I do something else entirely?

So basically i was at my grandparents house and all my family was there, like it was thanksgiving or something, ya know pretty normal. Then my grandma saw my cuts and everyone got super shocked/mad. i freaked out, but didnt tell them anything and ran upstairs.  everyone stayed where they were and was basically like \"well think about what you did and when your ready to explain your self get over here!\" So i was pacing around the room thinking of what to say. Irl my aunt has rlly bad depression, but in my dream i saw that my aunt had cuts. So i tried snitching on her for that but obviously they didnt believe me. And the dream just ended with me pacing around  and having a panic attack\n\nI know this may seem crazy, but a lot of my dreams like come true sometimes,, like no joke, fore example ive had dreams where i would argue with my aunt about aetheism, and it happened, i had a dream where my teacher died, and literally the day after she was gone for a month.

Honestly I\u2019m not entirely sure myself, but I think because I do a lot of other self harm stuff (pulling hair, eating my fingers, picking at my skin and acne to a fucked up degree, hitting my head against things), and because pleasure is more of a byproduct of why I do this, I thought I should post it here.  \n.\n.\n.\nSo I shove my fingers up my ass until my rectum bleeds.

There is no way I\u2019m going to be able to stop by myself, and it\u2019s definitely not a healthy or even sexually motivated habit. I started doing it because I was convinced I had too much shit in my body, and I think I kept doing it because I realized on some level I was hurting myself, and fucking my shit up made me feel really good. I\u2019ve always justified it as medical necessity given my made up intestinal issues, but I\u2019m doing serious damage to my body at this point and I\u2019m afraid this ends in a really bad place. \n\nI managed to lie to my mom a few years ago about \u201csqueezing to hard\u201d after It dawned on me that maybe this action had consequences. I got a rectal check where the guy basically told me I had a fuck ton of hemmorhoids. I don\u2019t think he checked hard enough because that shit is defiantley prolapsed as well. I pretty much vomit pre-digested shit at this point and my metabolism is fucked.\n\nmaybe this is an anomally or something, but I justify it for the same reasons as all of my other self destructive behaviors: I don\u2019t really care about hurting my body as long as nobody notices, and it feels good to know im taking poor care of myself. I\u2019m honestly just confused and angry at this point. Maybe I should think of this as an eating disorder? I\u2019ve been in so much fucking denial I don\u2019t even have a grasp on what the fuck is going on. Somebody help me.\n\nTLDR: I shove fingers up my ass and it\u2019s bad for my health.

I tried so hard to not cut while he is away but now I\u2019m really not able to anymore. I KNOW he cares a lot but these actions don\u2019t show it at all. I feel unwanted, alone, scared and mostly depressed af. \n\n\nI\u2019m no even blaming him. I can\u2019t force him to stay and telling him I\u2019d be cutting without him is just abusive behaviour. I\u2019m not resenting him for leaving me alone, I\u2019m hating myself because I can\u2019t seem to be able to do something remotely useful alone right now.\n\nBut what do I do? I can\u2019t hold on any longer. I need to study, I can\u2019t concentrate. I threw up three times but I can\u2019t tell him because he\u2019d feel guilty when he isn\u2019t. What do I do? When I cut he\u2019ll blame himself. I don\u2019t want him to feel burdnend, yet I can\u2019t hide it either because I don\u2019t want to break his trust. \n\nI had a huge panic attack earlier this day because all this stress, this depression, everything reminds me of my abusive ex boyfriend. \n\nWhat the fuck do I do? I really really want and need to cut. I\u2019ll definitely be able to do something then for my studies and yet it\u2019s so stupid. Plain stupid. \n\nI\u2019m not even sure how I managed to write this when I can\u2019t really see anymore or read sentences.\n\n\nSorry and thank you to anybody reading this, I just had to rant I guess. Not like I can do much now anyway. Maybe I\u2019ll hold on cutting until he comes back. Maybe I won\u2019t. For sure I won\u2019t be studying today I guess. And I can quit University.

Sometimes I cut because it makes me feel close to her again, to help me remember her. I'm afraid of forgetting her in totality. It doesn't work completely of course. At most I delay the process. My memories of her are on borrowed time. That's why I cut, to help keep her alive in some way. ", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Which is a rather dangerous thought, as I look back on it now.)\nI dont think I was feeling particularly bad a week ago (when i started it back up) but the whole time i was like \"why am i doing this?\".

I can read people well. This was not manipulative. This seems like a relapse in her bad habit. She is very open with me, and she forgave me, but I can't shake the guilt. Those will be there because of decisions I made, and probably for the rest of her life. It makes me twitch. I do feel really good, though, because I bandaged her up, and she's never done that before. She's told me how these ones weren't/haven't been itchy. I gave her a [big band-aid](https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fmascporter.files.wordpress.com%2F2011%2F04%2Fbig-one-little-one.jpg&amp;f=1). She said these ones don't hurt as much. But they're five big red cuts. I saw how much blood she lost when she moved the little white towel she tried to use to stop the bleeding from her thigh. I went into mama bird mode and searched her pantry until I found band-aids that were huge. She allowed me to put it on her. I've played Doki-Doki literature club, and not being able to stop one of the characters from suicide (no matter what options you choose) made me watery-eyed, but I knew it wasn't real. I got Doki-Doki flashbacks when replaying the events in my head. Before she went away to cut herself, I asked her not to, but I wasn't too assertive, because I didn't want her to think I thought she would cut herself. She was stoic, and seemingly unfeeling. The way her mouth hung slightly open haunts me. Her eyes haunted me. This person, who looked so unfeeling, was the same person who ate cake with me. This was the same person who laughed with me. The same person who kissed me on the lips. She looked at me, but her eyes weren't focused on anything. Nobody seemed to be home. I saw nothing. She went away for a while, I assumed to ruminate on how I hurt her, but she came back about half an hour later, and she seemed more alive. I don't remember why or how she did it, but she showed me what she did and I went into mama bird mode. I immediately regretted not going to check on her, especially because I thought about going to check on her very much but I didn't want to make her more upset. From what I know, she does not like thinking about things that hurt her, and this is her escape. She's gotten better now, but I feel like the reason for her relapse. If I didn't lie to her, she wouldn't have hurt herself. But I know it's ultimately her decision. I'm not upset at her, but I want the best for her. I'll give her how every many band-aids she needs and stay with her unless she'd like to leave. I don't want to lie to her again, and if I do lie, I hope it doesn't make her hurt herself. I don't want to lie, but I'm pretty weasel-y. Why did these cuts seem to make her happier?", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Now, I deeply despise myself, and am completely alone in my daily life-stuck in my sickening mind constantly dwelling on my lifeless past. And so I want to cut myself, out of both self hatred and a desire to validate these feelings I've had. I've thought about cutting before, but sharp ends penetrating my skin have always been a particular phobia of mine. The thought of even something like fingerpricking with a lancet, something that diabetics do on the daily, makes me squirm. When I press the blade into my skin I feel faint and my legs turn to jelly. I don't want to be a bitch. To me all the badfeeling has been very real, but I'm so insecure and unstable I even feel insecure about being depressed, and I need to cut myself to validate those feelings.

I don\u2019t have much to say on the subject but the other day I was in the bathroom, looking for a towel, and I\u2019m wearing a flannel with the cuffs unbuttoned.  My mom comes in, she said she was about to take a shower (in other words, kicks me out, because she\u2019ll be \u201creally quick, I promise\u201d) and we go back and forth for a quick thirty seconds or so.  It\u2019s light, whatever.  I raised my arm up to stretch and didn\u2019t notice that my sleeve sort of fell down and gave way to the noticeable cuts on my wrist.  Now I don\u2019t know word for word what she said, but it was something about the lines of, \u201c[name] what is that on your wrist?\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cNothing,\u201d quickly, put my arm down.  My eyes were wide and I knew I was likely flushed.  I was stricken with fear.  I hadn\u2019t ever felt so ashamed and afraid.  This is something I wanted to remain a secret.  I usually am one to burst out laughing or just start smiling/giggling at things that are sad, serious, etc, but my face was grave.\n\nShe said, \u201cWhat is it?  It\u2019s not nothing.\u201d\n\nI insisted it was nothing.  I was nervously playing with my sleeve.\n\nShe said again, \u201cWhy?  Why would you do this to yourself?\u201d  \n\nI didn\u2019t know what to say, so I told her I didn\u2019t want to talk about it.  We stood in silence for a little while longer before I walked past her to my bedroom.  I laid down in bed and started to cry.  I pulled up my sleeve to look at my wrist.\n\nI texted my best friend.  He\u2019s always supported me and he\u2019s one of the only people I\u2019ve told.  I told him last year, too, when I was cutting.\n\nSince this reddit doesn\u2019t allow photos, I\u2019m going to write what the texts said:\n\n\n-My mom just saw my wrist\n-Just a little bit of it\n-My sleeve fell a bit when I raised my arm and she was like \u201cwhat is all over your wrist??\u201d And I said nothing, that I didn\u2019t want to talk about it, and she said \u201cwhy shouldn\u2019t we talk about it??  Why are you doing this to yourself?\u201d And I just sort of left the conversation omg \n-Im crying idk what to do\n\n\nI continued to cry, my friend never saw the texts until later because he was napping.  \n\nI laid in bed and tried to look at memes, whatever, make myself stop crying.  My mom came in after she had showered and closed the door behind her, said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about this.\u201d\n\nI told her I\u2019m suicidal and that I\u2019ve told her before that I need help.  She said she shrugged it off before because she thought that maybe I was saying it only in the moment sort of thing.  And i told her that i was doing it last year too and I\u2019ve repeatedly tried to reach out.  She asked why so i said that I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just stressed and suicidal and it\u2019s just the only way for me to cope with it when I feel like every time I try to get help it\u2019s ignored.  I also asked her not to tell my stepdad, who I feel like has always been a cause of my stress.  He\u2019s one of those people who has brought me stress and it\u2019s like one of those \u201cbroken family\u201d scenarios where it\u2019s like, this great man/woman steps in and takes care of the broken family, and the family doesn\u2019t realize how horrible he is until after it\u2019s too late.\n\nI didn\u2019t know how to express this.  I\u2019ve been constantly hurt by people and I didn\u2019t want to tell my mom that I was cutting (badly, too\u2014this time it was all up my arm, elbow to wrist, deep cuts) because I didn\u2019t want her to feel like it was her fault.  But, again, I have said that I need help,  for the past two years I\u2019ve been asking\u2014BEGGING\u2014for help.  Last year, (I was cutting then, too) I told my mom I was suicidal and it was like \u201coh, we\u2019re going to get you the help you need, we care about you, blah blah blah\u201d but then I never got that help, because we didn\u2019t have the money.  $100-200 a week for some sort of counseling\u2014meanwhile my stepdad spent more than that weekly on beer, cigarettes, and lottery tickets.  \n\nI was angry.  I was hurt.  Several times after this I tried getting help.  Just this early winter, I told my mom that I\u2019m STILL depressed.  I said I feel useless and numb and sad.  I said I NEED help.  Still, nothing.\n\nI even told her that I feel like every time I reach out, nothing comes from it.  So now I\u2019m just hopelessly waiting to \u201cget better\u201d on my own or... what?  To kill myself?  For something bad enough to happen that it makes people actually care?\n\n\nWhen I think about how my mom found out that I\u2019ve been cutting myself... it feels so surreal.  Like, it\u2019s painful to think about.\n\nThat night I even had a dream where my mom and dad were in the kitchen, and they started yelling at me because of my self harm.  It was frightening.  My dad yelled, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?  Your father?\u201d\n\nand I yelled back, \u201cBecause you\u2019re never here!  You left!  How am I supposed to tell you when you\u2019re gone?\u201d\n\n(He\u2019s across the country, by the way.)\n\nI don\u2019t remember much else but then my punishment was to scrape the linoleum off the floor or something... which I cried about, I said I didn\u2019t do anything wrong,  I cried and said I need help.  \n\nIt was scary.  I\u2019ve always hated being yelled at or embarrassed in front of people.  My stepdad would always do that to me.  In front of family, in front of my friends, in front of his\u2014it was like his greatest joys were always making me look like some brat for no reason.  \n\nFor months and months last year, winter, when I started self-harm (on my arms\u2014I had cut my thigh the fall before) I wore sweatshirts and I barely left my room.  I ate very little, probably once a day.  If I did eat, I binge ate.  I cried.  I didn\u2019t know what to do.  I would be snappy because I felt so lost and sad and nobody would just ask me what was wrong.  It felt like nobody cared.  The only people who cared about me were online, (I say that\u2014I mean mostly my friends from school who I could only access from my phone) and everybody in my family was constantly rude to me.  Maybe I was being irrational.\n\nI remember one time I had almost started crying in the living room, saying something about being stressed.  My stepdad said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know stress.  You can\u2019t possibly be f*cking stressed until you\u2019re an adult and you have to work.\u201d\n\nOther times he\u2019d make fun of me for crying.  He\u2019d call me out in front of people.  Last summer, we were playing cards (+ my mom, Uncle who is also a teen, aunt who is a year older than me, other aunt who is an adult, and her boyfriend/my stepdad\u2019s coworker) and I was happy, my uncle and I were looking at cool apartments and whatnot and I was talking about wanting to move to the city for college since Columbia has always been my dream university.  My stepdad goes on, butts into the conversation, just so he can berate me.  He says I can\u2019t do it, I\u2019ll never make it, I can\u2019t work hard enough, etc.  I was angry but said nothing.\n\nI\u2019ve always been there to babysit the adults in my family when they get drunk or whatever, with little kids in the house.  I\u2019ve always cleaned up after them.\n\nSo, yeah, I\u2019ve been stressed.  I just didn\u2019t know how to tell my mom that self harm isn\u2019t something you can just bring up.  It takes guts to be able to talk about it, tell somebody, especially a parent\u2014those kids of guts I don\u2019t have.\n\nShe was upset because we\u2019ve always shared everything (not really, I\u2019m a lot more closed off due to being yelled at, promises not kept, berated, etc) and I didn\u2019t share the fact that I hurt myself with her.\n\nIt still feels like it didn\u2019t happen.  I feel physically ill knowing that it did. \n", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

A few weeks ago, the mods put out a survey for us to take if we wanted. It asked a couple questions that could be plotted to charts, so that's what I did today. A number of the questions were not really conducive to analyzing (free response), so these are just a few of them. Anyway:\n\nAll in all, we had **379** responses at the time I took the sheet to analyze.\n\nThe most common Meyers-Briggs type by far was **INFP.** [Here](https://imgur.com/DAhsV5t) is the data and the graph for most of the data. Every Meyers-Briggs type had at least one response. There were a number of no responses.\n\n**13%** of responders wished not to be contacted via PM. **49%** didn't want to commit to being available via PM :P ([Link to data](https://imgur.com/wund8zh))\n\nAnd, finally, the one I was most interested in personally: age. More than **half** of responders said they were between the ages of 16 and 20. There was equal representation in the 13-15 and 21-25 groups. The oldest age group represented was 41-45. There was no one in the 36-40 group. [Here](https://imgur.com/nwIMT7F) is that data.\n\nSo, takeaways: this survey was designed as a directory, not as a statistical survey; these results should be taken with a few grains of salt max. But nonetheless, they're really interesting. I find it fascinating how many people marked themselves as being available via PM. I wonder why a quarter of us said INFP. And it's interesting just how many young people there are here; people under 26 made up the vast majority of responses.\n\nThanks to the mods and to everyone who responded.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

You've turned to self-harm to deal with the stress, the emotions, whatever may be going on in your life. You live a double life, hiding your self-harm from the people around you: parents, friends, teachers, etc. You don't want anyone to find out for any number of reasons, be it fear of consequences, embarrassment, or not wanting your \"poison\" of choice taken away from you, among others.\n\nHowever, despite the fear and anxiety accompanied with opening up about your self-harm and mental health, please, please, PLEASE do it now while you're still a teenager. The time to nip these mental health issues in the bud is NOW. Not after you graduate and move out. Not when you're 24 years old like me, having been addicted to self-mutilation for almost seven years.\n\nThe reason I encourage you to open up to someone now is because of my own experiences. You do not outgrow self-harm, you become addicted to it. You do not outgrow the underlying mental illness(es), either. It will just continue to fester and get worse until you open up to someone who can offer support and help.\n\nTrust me, you do not want to be an adult who self-harms. The more years you put into self-harm, the harder it can be to stop. Plus, there are virtually no resources for adults who self-harm (at least where I live), and there are TONS for teens. Why? Because self-harm is still (mistakenly) viewed as a teenage mental health issue. Also, sad truth is, doctors are more interested in helping teens who self-harm than adults who do it.\n\nSo try and open up to someone. A friend, a parent, a teacher, a doctor, someone you feel you can trust. And maybe you feel you can't trust anyone because you're still a minor. But here's the thing: you've got to take advantage of your age now to get help now before adulthood comes on. Adulthood is a bitch. It's a tough world out there. Now, imagine moving away, going to college, and trying to start a career/get back on your feet, all while trying to manage mental health issues you never addressed earlier, things that could have been addressed earlier. That's my life. Seven years, and still no relief. I wish I had opened up to my family doctor years ago when I was 17, but I didn't, and now here I am, several suicide attempts and cuts later, 24 years old and I'm still struggling immensely every day.\n\nAs someone who wished she had spoken out earlier, I urge you to take my message into consideration. Get help now before you're an adult, so you can potentially thrive as an adult.\n\nTL;DR Teens, please try to seek help before you're an adult because things are going to get harder otherwise", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I'd struggled like many with depression and all sorts of mental health issues for years, and when it started, self harm was the first coping mechanism I turned to within the first day. After finally reaching a suicidal point last year to the means of attempt, I had decided on the other end of it that despite the mental torment everyday, I'd least abstain from self harm, as the only place of I've ever done it is, again like many, on my forearm. It gets so boring everyday to cover it up with something, and only serves to feeds into my anxiety around people. I've kept it to one spot, but if I wear short sleeves I still have to put something over it. After my 'ultimate' decision to stop, the goal was to give it enough time to heal that it could be tattooed over, and at least camouflage it, if not hide it conpletely. Well, my mental state isn't as healed as I thought it might be. Self harm was escapism, and when I wasn't self harming it was drugs or alcohol. Well alcohol played a predominant part past year, and it only made me sad, and made me want to cut. When i started to cut, I would be sober, and the physical pain meant nothing to me, cut (pardon the pun) to 4 years ahead and the pain was scary to me. I no longer want the physical pain. Sure I want the release, but not the pain, or the pain and shame of hiding it; but i strongly underestimate alcohol. It can really bring out the sadness and the desire to feel like s##t. Suffice to say, the only time I have self harmed since my decision to not to has been becuase of alcohol! I'm 24, this journey of growing up is definitely one step forwards and 4 steps back, but with each step backwards, i feel like i learn something new about how my brain works, or not necessarily works, but more so the habits I've formed because of the coping mechanisms I've relied upon in the past.\n\nI'm always looking to escape, and if alcohol is involved, 9/10 times I'll cut, but the sober truth is I dont want to. I know what I need to fix is the vices I use to escape reality. Each time I cut is a promise to myself that I'll stop. It's one last release. One last moment to myself. I really hope that one day that comes true. \n\nAnyways, I'm just venting on a throwaway. I always read this thread, and it's so reassuring to me that so many others struggle. We're all a collective yet so isolated at the same time. Such a bizzare living we lead. \n\n\nMuch love and hope to all of you. We all need to be our own friend, but when we cant, it's always nice to remember we have friends out there we don't and will never know about. \n\n", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I had to tell my mom in the first year because of my psychologist and my age at that time. She had always thought that it stopped in that first year, but I just lied to the psychologist and stopped seeing her and never talked about it ever again to my mom. This was not something I ever shared to other family members, mostly because I felt like I should be ashamed and I felt like I would be punished more than helped for this behaviour. \n\nLast year I went on a trip with my whole family and since we spent most of our time in the beach, they saw my older scars on my legs. Prior to that trip I didn\u2019t cut for a few weeks, therefore I could just say that they were old scars and that I was better now. My father was the only one who brought them up because he didn\u2019t realize what they were until I told him. \n\nThis year, I went on a trip alone with my mom. Although I took the same precautions of not cutting for over a month prior, some cuts just wouldn\u2019t heal and stayed very red, especially compared to the others (I don\u2019t cut deep so they usually turn white after 2 weeks). When my mom saw them on the first day, she just made a comment about it, in a voice that told me she was disappointed and kinda disgusted. There was no sympathy and she never asked what made me do it. This was the only time we talked about it. \n\nMy sister-in-law invited me over for dinner. I\u2019m not necessarily close to my family members because I only have brothers and they are all older, but when I got the invitation I immediately said yes because I want to be on better terms with my brothers and their girlfriends. While over there, we talked about many different things and the trip with my mom was brought up. We were talking about how my mom can\u2019t keep her mouth shut about anything and my sister-in-law was saying how it must be sad that I can\u2019t tell my mother anything because she\u2019ll tell my whole family about it, no matter how private it is. She brought up how during the trip, my mom told her and my brother how I had new scars and that I was still self-harming. My mom called this brother every single day so I never paid attention to what she was telling him, but apparently I should have. \n\nNow I don\u2019t really know what to do because my self-harming is something I was very private about and never wanted to tell my brothers. I know they won\u2019t tell other people, but we\u2019re not close enough that they\u2019ll actually come to talk to me about it, but they\u2019ll probably talk about it amongst themselves. I also want to tell my mom how she had no business telling people about what she saw, especially considering that she didn\u2019t even ask about it to me, just made a negative comment about it. This past year has been quite shitty and I\u2019ve been having a hard time, but I can\u2019t talk about it with my mom since she won\u2019t understand. My girlfriend and best friend used to cut and recently said something kinda offensive about people who SH, as if she was belittling me so I\u2019m not comfortable anymore about talking to her about it. I grew apart of most of my closest friends and feel like I would bother them with my problems. I don\u2019t have the money to go see a psychologist, especially that my workplace are slowly cutting my hours due to a restructuring of the company. I like my sister-in-law and appreciate that she told me that she knew, but we have different view points on mental health (for example, she thinks people with ADHD should just go outside more and that pills are only detrimental) and don\u2019t feel comfortable talking to her about it. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that this is all just rambling but I don\u2019t know what to do right now and felt like sharing with other people. What this thing was supposed to mean is that my mom talked about my SH to everyone except me and now i\u2019m uncomfortable because everyone around me knows about this even though it\u2019s been my secret for the past 6.5 years.

Sometimes i feel like im not living nor dying.\n\nI have cut, punched, scratch and pouring boiling water to myself, but thats the way i have to deal with things, I do not believe thats the right way to deal with pain and the urges get higher every time.

That way it seems like what im doing is for nothing but for me is like a way of SHing more healthy? It doesn\u2019t make sense but what i mean is that i have learned to take care of myself, cleaning the cuts and taking care of them instead of doing it in a dangerous way.\n\nStill i think this way of \u201csurviving\u201d and living is really bad, but it was the only way to stop me of being suicidal and at least i can force myself to look happy in front of my friends and family not for me but for them. I don\u2019t wanna hurt them in any way and i feel sick that i have come to this, but at the end if I can make happy my friends sometimes i feel not-worthless. If i keep this for myself until i can get help and get away my parents and brother and get support then i could be fine someday.

I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m complaining, I think I\u2019m writing this to not feel so alone and reading what you all put on here gives me comfort to know that it\u2019s okay to be where I\u2019m at, and that I\u2019m not alone.\nI guess what I\u2019m really asking is if anyone has ways of working on being more comfortable about speaking up and if there are any small measure I can start taking to start the process of opening up about it.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I cant stop thinking about how it feels, even though I know thinking about this stuff literally causes nothing good.\n\nAlso a while ago a song came on and it's one of the ones that tends to put the thought of sh into my head.

She admitted to cutting and being extremely depressed, and at some point they found out that she has been thinking of ways to commit suicide. I'm assuming my mom freaked out, and she was getting ready to take my sister to a children's hospital nearby when she saw that my sister had gone into the bathroom and cut her arm up with some blade. They're at the hospital right now, and my mom just told me that when they were coming in, the security guy found a blade hidden in her phone case. She is being considered \"high risk\" and they have found cuts all over her arms and thighs. She won't talk to my parents at all really, right now. My mom thinks she's going to be committed to the psych ward at the children's hospital for a few days.\n\nShe has one friend, who has apparently been calling her a \"fat cow\" among other things. She is very isolated, and stays in her room almost all day unless she's out in the living room playing Roblox. She's been dealing with some other stressful shit--a while ago, we found out that one of the neighborhood kids she was playing with was forcing her to sign up to porn sites on her phone (!) and another neighborhood kid she's closer with told her that this girl made her little brother masturbate in front of her. We recently found out our old dog has cancer and may only live for a few more months, and we had to put down another family dog last year for a different type of cancer (she didn't want to come to the vet when we had to put him down, and she didn't really talk about it afterwards). She really doesn't do much other than play video games, watch videos on her iPad, and create videos of her toys on YouTube. I thought she may have had depression a while ago (she has a really messy room, is super isolated, etc.--stuff I did back when my depression got really bad) but because of her age and because she seemed to be doing okay otherwise I dismissed the idea. \n\nI'm sitting in bed right now, shaking a little bit, completely unable to sleep or calm myself down. What do I tell my mother? What do I tell my sister? What do we do going forward? I am away at college right now, an hour away. I have zero experience with any of this and I'm kind of at a loss.\n\nI will try to update this thread when I hear more.\n\nEdit 1- her friends have been calling her \"fat and retarded\", and she apparently got the blades from her pencil sharpener\n\nEdit 2- she was discharged from the ER. My parents have been ordered to lock up all sharp objects and medications. She is going to receive counseling and medication for anxiety, and my mom is taking her out of public school for now and doing online school instead (she has been having issues with nasty kids at school). I'm going to try and go home this weekend if possible, and I'll try to text her in the meantime. Thank you for the responses so far\n\nEdit 3- I'm passing on all your posts to my mom. She's probably napping right now, so she may not respond for a while.\n\nEdit 4- mom woke up, has been talking to me about what's going on. She is thankful for all the info on what to expect. She sent me a couple pictures of the art my sister's been drawing (anime, wolves, and stuff that looks like it's from drawing tutorials, and she seems to have figured out how to blend shading). I'm bringing her some art supplies home this weekend. My mom is planning on taking her into counseling ASAP, get her on medication for her anxiety, and keep her out of school for now. The mental health doctor she saw at the ER is concerned she is going to have body image issues, so she will be going to an adolescent medicine department at the children's hospital for that. She seems to be convinced that she is overweight, not good at anything, and not smart (all of which is not true). They've been trying to talk to her but she has shut down right now and won't really talk at all.\n\nShe apparently has an online friend who she texts and snapchats with, who my mom says is really nice. A girl from across the street (i think the one who signed her up for porn on her phone) was at one point texting her, threatening to beat her up, so my mom is trying to have her phone number changed. She hasn't responded to my texts yet but at this point I think she's not really feeling like talking to anybody right now, so i won't pressure her.\n\nEdit 5- turns out I've been texting the wrong number.

I just need to get some stuff off my chest. \n\nI have depression. I haven't gotten help or even been diagnosed, but I know I have it. I used to cut when I was about thirteen or so. I had a pretty rough preteen stage in life. After I was about 14 or so, I went into a sort of \"remission\" I guess. It stayed that way for years. During those years the was only passing episodes of depression that didn't stay. \n\nThis past year has been different. I realized I have anxiety, along with depression. I don't know... Maybe one caused the other. Anyways, ever since autumn 2018 my life has gone in a downward spiral emotionally. Some good things have happened, like me being a boyfriend and getting accepted into my dream university, but my emotional and mental state has gotten progressively worse. Things got worse when I had an anxiety attack in January. I couldn't handle anything and was out of it, I was in pain, physically and emotionally. Oh, and I also am always in pain physically because of some kid of back problem... Anyways, the anxiety attack was so bad that I could only focus on one thing. Cutting. \n\nI had been able to suppress that urge for years, I haven't done it since I was 13. I'm 18 now. And I January 2019, I relapsed. I forgot how cutting made me feel.... How much I needed that distraction... \n\nIt also made me realize I need help.\n\nFunny thing, the one good thing in my life has given me the ability to do this to myself. My boyfriend was the one who gave me the knife I now use to cut. He didn't know. It's not his fault... It's all my fault. \n\nI didn't cut deep in January. It was only once that month. The cuts healed, no scarring, I was timid that first time... Then a few days ago I relived some trauma I had gone through my entire life, I'll spare you that story, but it left me distressed and hopeless... And so fucking mad. I cut again, just two days ago. I am afraid I won't be able to stop myself if something happens again. I'm afraid I'll do something worse, maybe cut deeper, maybe something else. I just can't do this anymore. I absolutely adore my boyfriend, he is madly in love with me, I want to live. If only for him. But I don't want to keep doing this to myself. I don't want to keep hurting myself. I don't want to be hurting.\n\nI don't know what I was trying to accomplish by writing this... I feel stupid for even typing this out...

But I\u2019ve been using things to strangle myself on and off since elementary school, and I\u2019ve started doing it again, to a more severe level than I ever have. \n\nI\u2019m stressed about how I keep lying and not talking about things I don\u2019t know how I can get better if I don\u2019t clear this up but the irrational side of me keeps convincing me that it\u2019ll be easier/better to just work around the lies and not have to stress about any potential consequences of admitting that I\u2019m worse off than I have indicated to him.\n\nI\u2019d like some advice on how to go about clearing it up I guess. I think if he were to bring up the topic of self harm or suicide, I would then be willing to talk about how I lied, but I clam up when I try to bring up specific topics often and I don\u2019t want to have to wait indefinitely for it to just happen to come up in conversation Bc I don\u2019t really trust that I won\u2019t hurt myself again...", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I told one of my closest friends, Rebecca, about me cutting since she used to and I was looking for advice.

I have 1 friend whose like \"good for you my dude!\", but they're all either salty or just kind of like I'm crazy. I can just tell I won't be happy unless I'm with him. He calls me beautiful like it's my name. Calls me just to say I'm beautiful and that he loves me. Its frustrating people can't see what I see. Idk we won't change our minds about it. So people need to get over it :/ Any advice???? We've talked about the future alot and we can see ourselves getting married and stuff, but legit I'm frustrated with the world.

She was genuinely upset and I felt so bad about myself, after the argument was over I got a razor and cut myself on my left shoulder. \n\nI've already starting seeing a therapist about a week ago, and I've told her about my dysphoria, depression, desire to self harm ETC. My next appointment is in a couple of days.\n\nBut I don't really have anyone to support me.

My closest friends moved away to other cities after high school ended, although I still somewhat keep in contact with them through Discord.  They know I am trans and they've always been really supportive. We're really close and I feel like we can trust each other with anything. When college started on September we haven't talked that much on Discord anymore. It's rare when we have a conversation that lasts beyond a handful of messages. However, we do our best to make up for lost time during school breaks.\n\nI feel like telling them would just upset them, especially since they can't really do anything because they're in other cities. And I know that they've both had suicidal thoughts in the past. It's actually kept me from committing suicide, since I'm scared about how they would react after I do it. \n\nBut I just feel really alone, and I don't have anyone to talk to. I'm really scared of being a danger to myself.

Sorry if this gets asked a lot, this is my first time in this sub, but how do you stop from hurting yourself or cope with the thought of hurting yourself? For context, I'm a 21 female who had been in an abusive relationship for a few years. During that relationship, I would hurt myself whenever I felt guilty or that I had done something wrong or to inconvenience that partner, although a lot of the guilt stemmed from fear conditioning and the emotional and verbal abuse. I had another relationship soon after the toxic one ended. That new relationship was totally healthy and good, yet I still felt conditioned to want to hurt myself if I felt guilty about something and thought it was just because not enough time had passed. Then that healthier relationship ended, not related to self harm or what I mentioned, though.  \n\n\nNow, I'm in an even better relationship and it has been a year since ending things with the abusive partner. I'm able to speak my mind with this person 99% of the time about anything, except this one thing we just got into. It wasn't even a fight or anything huge. What happened was I misinterpreted something through text that was meant to be a joke and then I apologized after for not understanding. But the problem is is that I think that for most situations, people should mutually apologize. Of course some things are more so one person's fault than the other, but in this case, I just wanted my partner to also apologize in the situation, just something simple like, \"Sorry, I realize that joke didn't exactly go down well through text\" or something along those lines. It came down to him just not realizing it was something to apologize about, which was fine. I hid my feelings about the whole thing for a bit though until I finally just poured it out, which I apologized for doing as well. We talked on the phone, and everything turned out fine. But I suddenly just feel horrible and guilty even though I know everything between us is okay. I don't know why I feel like this. I did feel like I inconvenienced him a bit because this all went down when he was supposed to be working on an assignment for school that is due in the morning, so I felt bad about that, but he reassured me that this was something important to talk about and that he wanted to make sure he mutually apologized for certain things in the future and understood me better. He really is the best partner I could ask for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor insight about the mutual apologizing thing, I have grown up with loved ones (mostly family and some friends) around me failing to apologize when they should. So I always apologize for every little thing to show someone I care and respect them, like if I'm wrong in correcting something they said, or if I bumped into them, or if I misunderstand something, etc. I know I can't expect people to be like me though, but my partner was really kind and understanding thankfully and wanted to start apologizing mutually in situations that called for that.  \n\n\nYet, why I am sitting here wanting to hurt myself and cry? Things are supposed to be better, and the entire call where he explained himself and I explained my reasoning was calm and rational. Am I really still just conditioned to want to hurt myself whenever I feel guilty about something even when the event has passed? How do I cope with these thoughts besides just being self aware and understanding where they stem from? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: Still conditioned to want to hurt myself whenever I feel guilty about something. Any healthy way to cope with such thoughts?", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I'm new to this sub, and I'm glad I found it. I've had a question weighing on me for some time now.\n\nSo I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. I was told I would grow out of it, but I'm almost 21 now and my major depressive disorder is still going strong. I'm ashamed that I am still cutting as an adult (as my mother said I should feel), but I really can't help it.\n\nI didn't start cutting until I was 18. A litany of family issues and self image issues lead up to it, and I can remember how I felt when it first happened. I liked the pain a lot. It gives me clarity and helps me relax when I can't sleep. It's like a sudden wave of peace. \n\nThe scars are beautiful to me. I love looking at them in private, but I feel ashamed when I am intimate with my s/o. He doesn't ridicule me or point them out (he's very supportive and wants me to stop), but I am painfully aware that he can see them. I don't like it when others can see, because I know what they will say/do. (Surprise! Self harm doesn't always mean you want attention lol)\n\nI also burned myself for a while, but I didn't like the burn scars as much as the cuts. With the cutting, I like how clean they are, and how they heal. My favorite thing is the bruising around them. I like the texture of the scars that remain after a couple weeks. I dream of seeing them all over my body.\n\nThere's so much to love, but I really want to stop. I rationalize it in my head so much that it's hard to see it under a negative light. Yes, it would kill me to see a loved one do it, but that doesn't stop me from wanting to cut.\n\nI've stopped a couple times, but I just start my mutilation cycle again. I think about it obsessively. Even when I'm not that depressed, I think about it. I want to be healthy, but all of those healthy coping mechanisms just don't help me 100% of the time. I often find myself cutting again.\n\nHow do I avoid relapsing like this? How do I stop thinking so much about it? I want to put it behind me, but a big part of me wants to keep cutting even when I've run out of easy to hide places.\n\nDoes the obsessive thinking ever stop?

This usually carries over to right at the beginning of school and it only usually lasts one or two class periods, because my friends and my great teachers can usually distract me and put me in a better mood after a little bit. Well, for all of this week I've been sneaking my pocket knife to school in case I got the chance and the urge to cut, and though the urge has been there every day at first hour, I could never get the chance to actually go to the bathroom to cut because I couldn't get up the nerve to ask the teacher if I could go. Well, today I got the chance.\n\nI still had the urge to cut by the time first hour was over, and we had an extra long break today because of some stuff the seniors were doing. I distracted myself for the first part of break getting some stuff done for my meeting with the school counselors later in the day, but that wasn't able to last me the whole extended break, so I eventually gave in to my urge. I dropped my stuff off at my next class, went inside a stall in the bathroom, got out my pocketknife, and did it. I was really fast about it too, I got it first try without any hesitation, which isn't usually the case. I guess the sense of urgency prompted me to do it quickly. It was also deeper than many of mine are because I was able to push the knife down a bit harder and slashed it a bit faster, probably because I was trying to do it quickly and I needed the first cut to satisfy me enough. So I did the deed, let it bleed for a second until the blood dried, washed it in the sink and dried it to make it less noticeable, and went on to my class. The unfortunate thing is that my next class almost immediately cheered me up, so if it hadn't been for that extended break I might not have done it at all.\n\nI'm not sure why I'm making this post to be honest, I guess I just had to tell somebody about this. This is a new milestone for me I guess, although definitely not a good one.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Hearing this broke my heart. I don\u2019t normally open up with anyone but after her prodding, I shared with my girlfriend what was bothering me and I cried in her arms like a baby. I felt weak, helpless, and more than anything embarrassed.  \n\nI\u2019m also struggling with school. I\u2019m in my second semester of college and I can\u2019t handle the pressure of it all. I did very poorly first semester (1.865) and am not doing much better now. I know this isn\u2019t a lack of intelligence, I am usually very smart. I just can\u2019t force myself to apply myself. \n\nI also compete in division 1 football and the physical, mental, and time demands are exhausting. Along with the struggles of normal football demands, having a terrible season and then losing most of our coaching staff makes me question if any of my hard work is worth it. \n\nFinally, my girlfriend. Recently my girlfriend started self harming as well and was brave enough to share this with me though I don\u2019t think I will share with her. We also just found out she has to withdraw from the university due to health reasons and I\u2019m not handling this well at all. \n\nComing out of high school I was very excited for everything in store for my bright future and was looking forward to all of the promise and potential college held for me.

All this to say, I stayed up all night last night thinking about everything that\u2019s gone down lately and made the decision to self harm. I cut my upper thigh. At first it was terrifying but then a sense of calm came over me and now I\u2019m worried that I will continue to do this or worse. I need help but don\u2019t know where to start. \n\nSorry if this was a bit of a rant, just a bit lost right now. \n\nTLDR; Things have not been going well in life. I\u2019m stressed and sad.

I couldn't take it though, telling her I wanted to go home. She got frustrated, drove us home and yelled at me about ruining her plans and how I would regret the way I treated her when she's gone. I spent the next two hours crying and trying to block out the overwhelming world, and she had a snack. Now somehow I'm the one feeling guilty and she's giving me the cold shoulder.

A few times in the past I would take a shaving razor and contemplate doing it while running the flat side over my skin. I had originally dismissed it as typical teenage angst, but now I'm starting to act on those urges and it's making me rethink it.\n\nThe first time I ever did this this was in a school club. Basically my anxiety got to a breaking point, and I hated myself so much that I felt the need to punish myself, so I started scratching the hell out of my forearm. If I had nails it might have looked worse, but thankfully I already bite them so it didn't leave lasting marks. I told my mom later on, and she got mad at me as if it was an attack aimed at her, and then threatened to punish me if she saw any more marks on me. So, now I know I can't tell her anything.\n\nLast night I saw that a girl in my grade and like 24 other students were getting an award for their class rank. I'm already super insecure about my academic achievements (and it's a major source of my self-hatred) and seeing that kind of set me off. I was already pent up from having a mountain of material to study for in AP Physics, and I think seeing the newspaper article pushed me over the edge. I started hitting myself in the head, and then scratching my forearm with my hands, and eventually I took a key off of my desk and started scratching with it. At the end of the whole thing I felt kind of drained.\n\nAfter doing it again today (my girlfriend saw me do it and got really worried, as she self-harmed in the past and was afraid for me) I decided I was going to start wearing an elastic band that I can snap to get the same kind of sensation. \n\nHow can I tell if any of this is real? How do I know that I'm not just looking for attention? I'm really freaked out by all of this, it feels like I'm in a different world.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

She told me she\u2019s not fully equipped to handle trauma and I thought she was gonna refer me to someone else, but she ended up telling me and calling a partial hospital program. I was doing better, so  I thought, but I told her I SHed the night before my appointment.

I started crying and it felt a release of all the anxiety and pain that was built up. I knew what I was doing was not good but It in a way made me feel better, i made 2 More small cuts and went to bed. The next few days I continued to do it, each time more than the last.

I was wearing shorts and they were riding up and she saw marks on my thighs and asked me why I did that, I promised I would never do it again and I didn\u2019t...for almost a month , my depression got worse and I started again.

New to Reddit as a whole, actually, and I started this account to ask for help. Gonna be a bit long, sorry.\n\nI started self-harming years ago, 6th grade actually. Now I\u2019m in 9th, and even though I\u2019ve been doing it on and off since that first year, I recently started again after I had a breakdown over Christmas break. I was worried because I\u2019ve never cut over my wrist, and never this deep (couple mm).\n\nSo I told a friend. A close one, even if I\u2019ve only known them since the beginning of the school year. They\u2019ve dealt with similar issues in the family before, and after I told them I found out they used to self-harm as well. They wanted me to tell my family or my doctor, but I\u2019m pretty confident that if, or when, they find out, it won\u2019t be my choice. But that\u2019s fine, I don\u2019t think they\u2019d help and honestly my relationship with my family means that I wouldn\u2019t accept it if they tried.\n\nThat aside, I think it helped. Now, this friend, though, I only told them last week, y\u2019know? And they have their own problems. I\u2019d like it if they helped me stop, but I don\u2019t want to force them or overwhelm them. I had this idea, where I\u2019d ask them to maybe be my friend for, I don\u2019t know, the long-term? And ask if they could help me come up with the tattoos to cover the scars, because there will be scars. And I\u2019d stop, because right now all I need is a reason and someone to help me out a bit, and that would be enough. \n\nThe problem is, I don\u2019t want to come off as controlling or clingy.

I don't remember who gave me the idea. I'd take pins from my sewing kits and lightly scratch my skin. I would irritate my skin to the point where I'd bleed and be left with peeling, red skin that itched in class. Once, I tried to take my Dad's razor once and cut myself but didn't actually take the blades out... haha. That one stung like a bitch. \nI stopped during the summer. I was too busy, not yet addicted enough to continue. I was so self conscious of my arms, though, that I'd keep them covered. Then, I went to an amazing summer camp. People told their stories. One of them I remember mentioned self harm. I was drawn to her. I did that! Hey! We're... similar.\nIt felt so good to see someone like me. Except I had no scars, no 'proof.' (Spoiler alert, you don't need very visible scars, or even scars at all to self harm! Not all methods result in physical marks. Self harm comes in many forms.) \nThen, this year I started high school. I remember the first time I  saw her. She had scars running up and down her arms, legs... everywhere. I tried not to stare. 'How would I feel' I told myself. She's my good friend now. I trust her. She is strong and she has made it this far, I am proud of her. \nThen, in mid November, I saw a post. About pencil sharpeners. It was that stupid generic one with the blade-less sharpener and a screw laying next to it labeled 'if you understand this, I'm sorry.' Or some shit like that. I immediately ran downstairs, grabbed all the sharpeners I could find. Took out the tool box. And all of a sudden there I was, alone, scared, sad, and in possession of tons of new tools. \nI don't remember the first cut I made, I don't remember if it bled, I'm not sure where it was, although I suspect it was on my arm. What I do remember was the rush of relief. I had a coping mechanism. And it worked. I remember the boost of adrenaline. 'I can't keep doing this,' I would tell myself. 'I can stop at anytime,' I reassured my worried head. If only I could stop at any time. \nIt continued like that for awhile. I'd keep them in little bags, or in that one pocket in my backpack, or in my pockets. I'd ripped out the post-it's from a box of them, and replaced it with my tools and anything else I might need. At first, I would try and keep my blades clean. I used alcohol or hand sanitizer and I'd put band-aids on my cuts, despite knowing I'd rip them off hours (or minutes) later because keeping my cuts closed irritated me more then getting them caught on my sleeves. I liked the pain.\nSomehow I realised there might be big blades in the toolbox downstairs. I ran down. I remember that day. I was supposed to see my cousins that day, go swimming. I grabbed the blade, knife, whatever you'd call it. I noticed a latch. There. An extra blade. I was terrified. It was so big. Then, that same day, I realised blades were in razors. I found a bag of old ones. Cheap ones. I used my new tool to rip them open. I think I cried that day. I never cry cutting. \nI didn't stop. I couldn't. I've been hiding for so long. I thought I could hide it. I found a friends vent account, an anonymous one. I don't know how I knew it was her. I just... knew. She talked of self harm. Again, what a relief. I wasn't alone. I'm not alone. She understand me. When my mom found out a few weeks ago, she was there for me. She hugged me the day after I told her over text, tears dripping down my face. My parents knew. I thought I was done for. I still do. \nI had just gotten myself (okay... shoplifted) some nice new blades. I accidentally left one in the cupholder. I noticed and put it in my retainer case. Because I had to go to the bathroom. Because I was tired. Because I honestly didn't care. Part of me knew she would notice. She did. \nShe pulled me into her bedroom. Told me to wait while she put my brothers to bed. I knew what it wasabout. Exactly what it was about. I could've run out, hidden. I didn't. She asked me and immediately pulled my sleeve up before I could answer. She was so stern. She didn't care about me, just about my 'precious body' being marked up. My scars aren't bad. At least not on my arm. At least not on that arm.\nShe hasn't gotten me help. She doesn't realise I've gone on to cutting my other arm instead. And my leg. I do it worse now. Deeper. She doesn't care. She's know for two weeks, maybe three. I have a swim party next weekend with my family. Today she told me I either have to go swimming, or she'll tell everyone there why I refuse to swim. I told her she might as well tell them. I don't know what to do. \nI feel like giving up.... \nIt's such a bitchy thing to do. Refuse to let your child hide something that personal from family they barely know. She doesn't get it. Isn't trying to get it. \n\n\n\n\nBut I've made it this far. I can keep going.\nI have to keep going. ", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

So I have been self harming for about 9 years now and this is the longest I have been clean. I am happly but oddly terrified at the same time and i dont quite know why. I have always found comfort in knowing that the blade is always right there and i had nothing to live for until about 4 monts ago. 4 months ago i met the most beautiful woman who is now my fiancee. She gave me a reason to get out of bed in the morning and to get better. I had not felt truly happy since i was about 6 or 7 then life got really hard. I was abused physcially,mentally sexually by my parents and a few other people. I have made huge strides these past 4 months. I went to rehab and I'm officially 1 month clean from doing drugs for 3 years I also shaved my head and am making tremendous progress in beating trichotellamania.(compulsive hair pulling) and a bfrb (body focused repetitive behavior) I am finally actually talking to,my therapist about whats really on my mind and not bullshitting my way thru a session like i always did. I feel so,much better and i feel I can only go up from here but there is something holding me back and i cant put my finger on it. Not cutting all the time feels amazing. I can finally wear short sleeves and not have to waer a hoodie over it to cover my cuts. I have bllod draw education from being a emt and I have found that when i have the strong urge to cut if i draw a vile of blood I feel better and it only leavs a tiny until noticeable mark for a day. The term I belive and feel free to correct me if I'm wrong is bloodletting (I will put a disclaimer here that if you are not a trained or licensed professional do not attemt to draw your own blood at home and dont steal or illegally buy blood draw equiment if you are intrested in this go get trained there are special corses for it and financial aid is available to those in need) this has been so helpful to me and it has become a new coping skill for me (I only do it about 3 times per 7 day week dont do this in execess it is dangerous and unhealthy if not done properly) my fiancee fully supports me in this.

If you bruise or burn or cut or pick or anything else to harm yourself, you are a valid self-harmer... scars or not. This is not a post to say that if you're not bleeding then you're not valid... its just to clear up some confusion I've seen on here and other related subs. \n\nBut I wanted to clear up something that bothers me... the idea of cutting to \"styro\", also known as the dermis. \n\nSo here it is: if your cuts bleed AT ALL, you've hit the dermis (\"styro\"). Your epidermis is avascular, meaning it doesn't bleed. If you cut and you see blood, that means you've cut past the epidermis to the dermis, and cutting to the dermis is what we call \"hitting styro\". \n\nIt doesn't matter if you can see the white layer under the epidermis that is the dermis... you've cut to it if you're bleeding. You don't need to cut deeper to see the white to have your cuts be considered \"styro cuts\" or to be considered a \"real self-harmer\" or \"valid\". \n\nNow obviously, in a perfect world, none of this would matter and people wouldn't feel the need to cut deeper to be valid... but from a medical standpoint, if you're bleeding, you've cut to dermis.\n\n*other notes to clear up confusion...*\n*if you're bleeding = you've hit \"styro\" or the dermis.*\n*the dermis (\"styro\") = the white layer. It takes a few seconds to fill with blood.*\n*subcutaneous tissue, or fat, = yellow and bubbly.*\n*fascia is underneath the fat tissue and is shiny and white.*\n*muscle is pinkish red and is under the fascia.*\n*if it gapes, get it closed.*\n\nThat is all, thank you.\n(source: 12 years of self harm and am a nursing student)", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I feel like that I have to be on the edge and compete against everything and everyone becuase I feel like the entire world is competing against me or else I will fall behind. \n\nI am 25 now and I genuinely feel old and feel like I am losing time. The many times people told me 'life is short' constantly irritates me and scares me at the same time as if I have to plan or capture every opportunity that I can encounter or else I might lose it and regret it and end up in the 'what if' rumination scenario. \n\nI feel like I have to be constantly on my toes and make sure that I am on the top of my game all the time, often times I even make comparisons with others and their achievements as if I am in a constant \"top people\" match or some sort of Battle Royale game to compete who is left standing. \n\n\nI get that this competitive edge can be useful both personally and maybe even socially if you want to be ahead on the competition but I feel like I am getting older slowly and feel like time is racing faster than I can keep up with, the constant fast paced nature that the world is in right now makes me overblown with anxiety and information overload and sheer uncertainty and paranoia because I feel like I cannot keep up with everything and I feel like this completely contrasts the whole idea that being good at something takes time, maybe years or even decades (the whole 'slow and steady wins the race' mentalitu), and the fact that I know that adversity, suffering and unfairness is a part of life but that is also very stressful becuase it makes me wonder if I ever will be able to get back on my feet again or be able to get back on my feet quick enough to reach the finish line or at least have an impact on the race. \n\nI am 25 now and I feel I **should** have a good grip of what I want in my life, as if it is expected of me to be in that kind of position right now (especially I will admit that I encountered plenty of drawbacks throughout my life so far, from bullying, neglectful parents, poor upbringing, mental disorders and the actual drug abuse, and unfair school systems and exhausting job hunting and sheer lack of self esteem and confidence. All of these put a lot of baggage on me and I felt like I was falling behind) , but in reality, I really **do not** have a grip on my life right now and no matter how much I try, I sometimes fear that I will never achieve it or fear that having a good grip in my life will make me becuase more laid back or having a good grip on something will make me fall back on something else. People tell me that being 25 I am still young but I definitely do not feel young\n\nAll of these combined, plus the uncontrollable factor of time and the uncertainty of the future or on other things that I have no control of, this constantly irritates me and frightens me all the time.\n\nI feel constantly on edge, constantly feel like I am racing and feel as agitated as if I am a guy who is constantly late for something or constantly wants to get things done as soon as possible (like within minutes but with the emphasis on being hasty instead of being fast and efficient. As if I am constantly losing my patience)\n\nI feel like I am constantly at war against everything and everyone and I feel like I am always on survival mode and focusing on who is left standing but I feel that my options are limited becuase my days are often either pre-planned or involve work which limit my possibilities for expanding my exposure to other things just to keep up or even just to be able to compete with others. (I know that life is short, or at least that is what I was told constantly and constantly for years but the more people say it to me, the more it utterly terrifies me!)\n\nIf I do not do this, even if I have little resources or time, I feel like I have nobody to blame but myself (which i have been doing for a long time especially that I graduated a few years late becuase shit happened in my life. I know that sometimes shit happens without you expecting it or without you being prepared for it, let alone if it was something that happened long ago or was beyond your control, but I feel like either you eat or be eaten or either you stand on your two feet or walk away and with that mentality, I feel like I have nothing to blame but myself. I know that the world is pretty cruel sometimes (or maybe all the time) and I know that life is pretty unfair sometimes (maybe all the time too) but I just feel that I really really really need to be on top of everything and everyone just for me to feel 'safe'.)\n\nHeck I sometimes wonder if I am feeling this way because I am the problem here (my reactions, emotions and interpretations of this whole shit show) or whatever I am conditioned to think like this becuase of how fast paced the world is and the other insane amounts of factors that are affecting how to think, whether it is the media that is telling me to be afraid or what to attend to, or whatever social media news or trend pops up or whatever photo is better that who or who is better in advertising themselves as the superior \"happy person\", or whether I am told that if I take this drug or this food or this TV, I feel better or feel like a classy person or whatever, or whether my political news are either genuine or biased or just do not care at all and all they can  think about is pushing an agenda and make the other political sides as supporters of the devil, or whatever I was told and emphasised by my family, culture and country and conditioned on how to think or what to think", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I have never been the self cutting person, most of the time I deal with my depression and I would just want to end myself. First off, I knew that self cutting is a way to relief emotional pain. After the encounter, I looked up, and I found that cutting is also a way to feel pain if you are not allowed to feel bad growing up and that they are the harshest critic of themselves and cutting is a way of expressing that.\nI want to get closer to him. I did not ask him about it and I like him a lot. We did not have sex, even though at one point I found out that he presented the opportunity but said I wasn't going for it, I'll spare the details. Not that I wasn't going for it but we were playing strip game, like card game with striping but with video games. Let your imagination runs with that. I can sense the passion in the time that we have intimacy, super awesome kisser. We have a lot in common. We both military. We both love games, cooking, reading , outdoor, traveling, etc. He in more introverted and I'm quiet the same and don't go out that often. He doesn't drink much but he loves wine and so do I.

I was in a relationship with someone who wasn't very emotional and quite cold and this became very difficult for me so the relationship ended. I was happy being single for a while. I've just ventured back out onto the dating scene and I only seem to find very unstable people that aren't very nice in a negative way - some of them are rude or too full on too quickly. Its a bit lonely being single for me at the moment; but it's begged a deeper question for me. \n\nI have self harm scars on my body, and hundreds of red cuts and white scars all over my right shoulder. I've never been ashamed of them. They are part of me that's very personal, however if I start dating somebody properly again (probably not anytime soon lol) how is she going to react when some of them are quite fresh, or if I can't stop?\n\nI managed to go a long time without self harming until I started withdrawing from my Quetiapine which I am on for bipolar disorder (I'm also on Pregabalin and Lamotrigine). I'm on a quarter of the dose I was on and I'm now feeling very low. I was supposed to start Aripiprazole but I didn't because I'm scared of the risk of diabetes or TD long term. I wanted to come off the Quetiapine because I was gaining a lot of weight and have become self conscious about my body. However now sometimes I get up and wish I didn't live in a body at all. I've been self harming a lot to cope with the feelings that have come back in the last four or so months.\n\nI might change jobs, because management has changed and my supervisor at work can be a bit of a bully and that's made life difficult at times aswell. I love my job, but need more support.\n\nI've got to a stage where I don't know what to do anymore. The only reason I keep on going is because of my Mum. My Dad died just over a year ago and she's the one person in my world that keeps me from ending it sometimes.\n\nSome people say that I'm the most positive person they know. They have no idea how much pain, sadness and loneliness that hides behind my smile. I am very friendly, and help many other people in life.\n\nI don't really know why I'm posting this. I know that no one can really answer any questions for me because I'm not asking any, I guess I just needed to tell someone who isn't going to feel upset about how I am at the moment as I feel so lonely. I guess that I'm not the only one who feels lonely and isolated, so want to reach out to others who also feel this way. You are not alone. You never know, I could be the girl you know who always smiles and says hello to you.\n\nIf you have taken your time to read this - thank you very much.\n\nStay safe everyone.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I had originally posted that it was an inch long, but when I looked at it later it was actually more like half an inch. A little bit is still dermis near the end, but the majority went to fat. (This was on my upper thigh btw.) I attempted to close it with butterfly stitches but I couldn't get it more than halfway shut (with tape to stabilize), remembered I never cleaned it, so took them off and realized the smaller cuts around it may pose a problem when several of them opened up upon removing the strip. Cleaned it with water, then decided it wasn't worth the hassle to try and close again, so I just bandaged it. I still don't plan on getting stitches. I can't afford to, and it will only make existing problems worse, the same problems that lead me to cut today.

Well I guess there's been one or two momentary slips since then but in terms of doing it regularly, it's been like a year. Not anymore. At first I thought it was just another quick slip. But yeah no it's been happening maybe every other day. Which I guess is better than at my worst but it's still not ideal. Ideal is not at all obviously. \n\nIt all pretty much has to do with college. My relationship with due dates and stuff is SO unhealthy. I'm depressed and have no motivation to do anything so I always wait until the last minute. And then I panic and I get super anxious that I can't even focus on what I'm doing. Like I'll try to finally do some work but I can't even think right. So to calm myself down I'll self harm. Usually cutting but sometimes other stuff too. And the sick thing is that it works. 8 times out of 10 it does actually help calm me down enough for me to get some stuff done. But then I always feel guilty and it's this viscous cycle. \n\nThat's where I'm at right now. It's a little past midnight and I have my first test of the semester tomorrow in chemistry.

But that's not as good of an idea since I can have the full intention of waking up at 7am to study and then I'll actually wake up at 9:30 and only have an hour or so before class.

The thumb tack didn't work, so I went and got a knife, which I've only ever done once before.\n\nI feel like absolute shit.

I don't see her the same anymore, and she doesn't treat me with as much understanding and affection. I feel starved for affection.\n\nI can't leave, though. I know someone's going to tell me to leave, but I don't know how. I'm about to panic just thinking about it. I've tried to just take a break for a *week* and I can't.

Obviously, it is not the best way to handle the situation but considering all the other alternatives, why is it considered to be so negative if it relieves one's pain? How is cutting yourself when going through a tough time any different than going for a run or working out for example.\n\nEach one of these has an impact on the body but if you create micro-tears in your muscle tissue through workout it is considered normal and healthy. Even though cutting yourself does not have a positive effect on your physical health, if it helps to stop a panic attack or a breakdown and helps to cope than it has a positive effect on your mental health. And in the end, the only 'negative' aspect that self-harming brings is scars which are just our bodies' natural response that doesn't affect your physical wellbeing anyway.

I\u2019m guilty of self harm (cutting), and nobody knows (although I think people are suspecting but I\u2019ll do a different post on that) and I have a friend who heavily implies she is too. She\u2019s very open about wearing bandages and bandaids on her arms, but here\u2019s the kicker.\n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s self harming\n\nI know know this a bold claim. She does have problems but here\u2019s why I don\u2019t think she is. Whenever I see the bandages or bandaids, I say, \u201coh, I hope you feel better,\u00a0\u201d or \u201cI hope your okay\u201c and she\u2019s expressed to my friends that she thinks I\u2019m \u201ccold\u201d\n         She has NO scars or even evidence of healing cuts. She doesn\u2019t wear the bandaids for too long, only about 2~ days. Certainly not enough time to heal unless it\u2019s a paper cut (which it\u2019s not \u201caccording to her\u201c and it\u2019s a bit sus considering she doesn\u2019t seem to wearing sweaters or long sleeve or anything (it\u2019s a uniform school) and it\u2019s odd to me. I KNOW it takes a while to heal from experience, so I call bs.\n       \n     Context to this one: she come to school in a f*ckin mask, and told me to pretend she cut herself on her face. \u201dWhat the hell?\u201d Was my first thought, but soon the mask got taken away.  She pretends there\u2019s a cut on her face, and she goes to the nurses for a bandaid. She comes back and I think to myself, wow the nerve of this girl, but I don\u2019t say anything because I don\u2019t want my friends to be suspicious, y\u2019a know?\n    \nLastly, she texts me stuff about how she\u2019s openly cutting her wrists and then when we get back to school, she\u2019s totally fine. I mean completely normal, no bandages, nothing! I would NEVER do that, and I don\u2019t even cut on my arms (I\u2019m more of a thigh kinda person tbh). \n     \n  If she\u2019s willing to lie about that, that\u2019s kind of enough telling for me. I want to be away from that friendship because she after this realization, not a good influence and a serious trigger to me. \nI think she\u2019s lying hardcore.\n\n\nTLDR: I have a friend who I suspect is lying about cutting for attention, mostly because she has no healing cuts or scars and asked me to lie to our friends about her cutting on her face :/\n\nI\u2019m not pulling this out of this air as a NeurotypicalTM would because (read the top paragraph) and I just don\u2019t know why she would lie about something like that.\n\n", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

And yet, there's one thing from that dark period in my life that I feel terribly regretful and ashamed about, and it's my self-harm behaviour. And I chose the dumbest way of doing it possible, too: I would hit myself on the head. When you're down in the dumps, you can't think straight, and the most unreasonable things make perfect sense, as to why would I do that. \nAnyhow, as the perpetual depression-induced brain fog began to lift, and my urges to self-harm went away along with my self-hatred, I looked back on this self-injuring behaviour of mine in utter horror. \n*\"Why would I do that?!\"*\n*\"What if I had done something to my brain?!\"*\nAnd I started noticing things. I became slower. I became less sharp. I lost some of my wit. It became harder to focus. I was forgetting words. You name it.\nFor the first one and a half months after the sudden realization I simply couldn't bear it. I would have sleepless nights, I would lay there in my bed, sweating and thinking about all the negative possibilities, trying to remember myself as I used to be, reading various medical sites, watching videos on the topic of brain anatomy, injuries and whatnot. Then I thought that it was health anxiety, but again, no conclusive evidence on whether or not I had damaged my brain. Doctors couldn't say anything about the matter, too, but told me to worry less. I would search and ask about head banging related brain injuries, and all I'd get is condescending or simple answers that didn't quite take my situation or my particular type of headbanging in consideration. Because, see, I wouldn't outright punch myself or bash my head against the wall or hit it with some blunt object; I would kind of, *knock* on my head with my fist, with the upper part of it where the thumb is, rapidly, with force that one wouldn't call strong, not to mention the fact that I'm a dweeb and have girly wrists. These knocks wouldn't cause any rapid jolts, wouldn't leave bruises or bleedings, wouldn't entail any concussion symptoms. It was enough, however, to cause the feeling of my head being \"full\", as if I can feel my brain pushing against the skull's walls and hitting them (I still get this sensation when, say, my car hits a pothole) Plus the cognitive and emotional relief, kind of like a high: your perception feels sharper and you generally feel fresher, but it soon changes with certain inability to focus. I'm not sure if I had the latter, because my memory of these events and the depressive episode itself is quite blurry. Not because of all the head banging, *hopefully*. I would hit myself on the top of my head and on my forehead.\nWhat I'm really trying to find out, is if my self-harm could've led to permanent brain damage. After skimming through this subreddit I found a couple of threads about self-harm via head banging, and some people were even voicing same concerns, which made me feel better, as at least I'm not alone. Yet again, some of the crucial details were lacking or were different to mine, like the force of the hits and the way they did it. I would greatly appreciate it if I could maybe hear some more stories from past or active head bangers, and maybe have some common sense bashed into my skull for a change, like scientific evidence on what hits are and are not dangerous etc.\nThanks in advance. It feels great to get all this off my chest.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Today it was different today it was anger.  I know for some people this is the norm and if so you don't have to read.  But I'll tell this weird story. So it starts with my friend, shes probably addicted to nicotine and she does weed. Similar to me she has pretty bad parents and is very familiar with self harm and the hospital. (we will call her D)  so D has pretty much been having problems with her best Friend  (who we'll call J)  to sum it up J knows D self harms and does drugs, he knows that shes getting pretty obsessive with her drugs and wants her to stop. D differently does not want to stop so what does J do???  He THREATENS HER.  So, already i was pissed with this guy who i was mutually friends with, it got worse after i read their messages. Pretty much he was threatening to tell her mom and the school, usually this would be a pretty okay thing to do, but J knows that telling D's mom will freak D out and stay quiet. (J is a drug dealer) yes welcome to my school. Another thing is that D's Mom is very abusive and will freak the fuck out if she knows D is doing drugs and she will be sent away to her fathers house, (who is even worse) or she will be sent to another family. (she could also get admitted to the hospital).  Well, i really didn't want to loose one of the only friends i have who i can really relate too.  Things have calmed down slightly and there's no communication between D and I and J. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWow, this paragraph just deleted im peeved))) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I have ceramics with J, and it really pisses me off how he acts all friendly and stuff while he knows his friend is skipping classes crying in a bathroom and having breakdowns. Now shes even doing more drugs than before and even started self harming a little.  It honestly doesn't help that nobody else in that class even helps me let alone talk to me. It just pisses me off. I didn't do much though, just purposefully threw  some clay and water during our time in the clay wheel. It brang me little satisfaction.  I ended up while i was cleaning up, finding a sharp dotting tool which i think is used to decorate some pieces of dried clay. I found it, cleaned it, and dragged it a few times. It ripped open some of my healing cuts on my wrists. I find it weird how i was feeling nothing but rage and then did that. I'm not mad at myself though. I personally love my self harm and know it's the only thing that helps me from killing myself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut that's whats happened today, please say if you've had a similar experience or a friend that had a same situation \n\nStay safe &lt;3\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

The basics are, I've self harmed for about 17years - cutting/burning/hitting myself.

I went crazy at my leg, I felt release but then soon after the usual shame and guilt. My partner noticed and it really hurt her. \n\nSo, fast forward 6 months and since then ive resorted to different tools, different methods and even gone so far as to stay up at night on the dark web researching how to commit suicide effectively. \n\nI have been to see my GP 7 times this month, to no avail but \"here try this tablet\" which turns me into a zombie. \n\nI guess what I'm saying is that for 15 years my self harm helped me to cope.

I was like \"PSH nah, not since September\" but that's a lie. I did it a few weeks before the conversation and again last night.\n\nA few weeks ago I went to the senior formal at my college and after I got back, I cut myself. I was miserable. Truly miserable.

I was the last person to get to the table that people I hang out with was sitting at and the only seat left was next to someone I really felt uncomfortable around. to top it off, the person that I've been infatuated with for the past few months seems to like my friend \"A\" better and was sitting next to her. I've stopped talking to my friends again because of this. I've not contacted them at all because I feel... desperate... that they don't like me and I don't want to come off as desperate or an asshole.

First - I talked to the wife of a homicide victim who did not know her husband had been slain. This was super shitty because I heard kids in the background of her call. She did not know her husband had been murdered earlier today, and not being able to tell her ate me up inside. I ended up setting up a call for homicide detectives to go out to her and talk since her address was in the same city. Made me sick. Second, I delivered a still born baby over the phone. Again, made me sick. There\u2019s nothing like the sound of two hopeful parents begging to God for their baby to be born alive - when you already have enough medical knowledge and experience to know it\u2019s a miscarriage. These calls pushed me past my comfort zone and really fucked with my head.\n\nAnyway, I texted the crisis text line tonight. I drank 8 beers and was barely able to talk \u2014 but needed the alcohol to help me ask for help. I was feeling a little suicidal earlier and just telling someone really helped. I feel less freaked out about my thoughts. I feel like I can just go to bed now. I\u2019m still not feeling super OK about stuff but I\u2019m defiantly NOT wanting to harm myself or kill myself right now.\n\nThe Crisis Text Line is 741741. Just text HELP to them, and they\u2019ll start a convo. I\u2019m thankful tonight that I had enough alcohol to give me courage to ask for help when I wanted to kill myself. I hope I never feel this way again but if I do, at least I know I have someone safe to talk to that won\u2019t necessarily end in arrest or loss of job.Thanks Crisis text line.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Now when I'm trying to quit self harm it backfired. A lot. I find them literally everywhere - they're on every shelf, in each cabinet, anywhere you can imagine. I was disassembling my broken laptop and have found 3 large blades for stationery knives in different parts of it, they've been there for almost a year now. Funnily enough, I flew internationally at least 20 times with that laptop with blades in it, and security hasn't said anything whatsoever. \n\nI've kind of been managing this problem by just not being at home most of the time - working until night in my lab or wasting my time at parties, but I got sick a couple days ago and have to stay home now. You can guess how hard that was - laying in bed knowing that if I just move the matress a little, I can find piles of blades under it. It feels like I'm haunted by them at this point - wherever I go, they're waiting for me in all sorts of places - the weirdest ones were probably in a pillow and behind a baseboard. I'm afraid to move in here at this point - I just go to the kitchen for some water and bathroom, and in my room I either lay on the bed still, looking up at the ceiling wondering when this will end or just go to my desk and start some game hoping to forget about everything. Even then I'm afraid to look anywhere but the monitor because I know there are blades on the table and just seeing could make me relapse. \n\nI still have at least one day before school starts and I probably won't be able to get out of here tomorrow as I'm still very sick, so that sucks. What would really suck though is ruining my 18 day clean streak - it's not much and I've done better but this one was insanely hard so far. Even when I won't be sick anymore I don't really have a way to not be at home - the roof of a building near the lab has crashed and the lab is closed for now, and there won't be any parties soon either because all of my friends are busy anyway.

I didn\u2019t quite know why I self harmed before. Obviously the chemicals being released in my brain when I cut is another reason. \n\nIt helps in so many ways. I\u2019ve been replacing it with eating, which only makes me feel worse because even though I\u2019m a decent weight, I\u2019m insecure about my body. I prefer being very thin. I have gender dysphoria so being thin really, really helps with my chest dysphoria. Not only that it squares out my jawline, makes my stomach and hips thinner, and I overall look more like a dead white boy than I do when I eat normally (lol). Although I\u2019m on testosterone, I still have a shit ton of dysphoria. I\u2019m only 15 so I can\u2019t afford top surgery yet, I plan to get a better paying job soon. \n\nI\u2019m extremely behind in school. I\u2019m online schooled so it makes it easier to fall behind. I\u2019m in this constant loop of being suicidal, then getting behind in school because it seems so pointless when I plan on dying soon. Then even if I am happy, that little bit of happiness is destroyed as soon as I open up my laptop and see how many assignments I\u2019m behind and how dumb I am. \n\nThe only reason why I haven\u2019t followed through with killing my self is because of friends and family. But, it\u2019s slowly starting to get easier to think about killing my self and following through because my friends and family rarely act like they love me. I have a boyfriend and I love him to death, even though I\u2019m young I do believe I\u2019m in love with him. He\u2019s 17 so we do understandably get shit for being together. Even more because we are gay. \n\nIt\u2019s possible that he has Aspergers. (I\u2019ll call him E from now on). My counselor and I have noticed symptoms that E has that matches up with Aspergers. I have no problem with this, it\u2019s just slightly hard to deal with sometimes. He gets angry and upset pretty easily, which luckily is rarely with me, but no one is very understanding of how sensitive he is. \n\nWith this the possibility of him having Aspergers in mind, he\u2019s not very affectionate. Affection is pretty important for me because I have Borderline Personality Disorder, so reassurance that someone loves me is extremely important. This was hard to accept at first, but I have come to realize that he doesn\u2019t show his affection in a physical way. I told him that I like physical affection and he does give me physical affection when I ask for it. \n\nHe is the most wonderful person to me. No one has ever been as nice to me as him. But sometimes he\u2019s unintentionally very rude. I told him I was having urges today, which I half expected him to drop everything and come to me and help me. Which I now know I shouldn\u2019t have. He just kinda texted me \u2018try your best not to do it\u2019 and continues hanging out with his friends. I\u2019ve tried my hardest not to get in the way of his other relationships with friends. But he much prefers hanging out with friends than me. Maybe that\u2019s just my BPD thinking that he doesn\u2019t like me, which happens often, but he really does act like it. He hangs out with my adopted sister a lot, mostly because she has weed and he has a dependency (which I don\u2019t like).\n\nHe basically goes where weed is. I do not have marijuana, so he either brings weed to my house or goes to his friends house. I really don\u2019t like that he can\u2019t handle being sober. I do understand it partly because I have an addiction to self harm. I wish he would at least try to not smoke it as much, but he really doesn\u2019t see any problem with it. I honestly don\u2019t have any problem with it, it\u2019s just when you can\u2019t go a minute without it and drain your money on it is when I have a problem. And because he\u2019s high quite a lot, he doesn\u2019t want to be bothered by me. He gets irritated easily when high. He\u2019s part of my friend group and all my my friends have a dependency on weed. They\u2019re all constantly high. I\u2019m relatively new to the group, so they brush my problems with the constant use of marijuana as just not being used to it yet. \n\nThey hang out without me, which is extremely upsetting because my adopted sibling is part of the group. They hang out without me in my own house. E obviously feels bad but he wants to hang out with his friends so bad that he comes to check on me for 2 minutes then goes back to them for an hour or two. I\u2019ve tried countless times to involve myself but whenever I enter the room they are in they just go silent and when I leave they start talking again. \n\nSince today they left my house with my sister and I was left here alone after already having pretty bad urges while they were here, I couldn\u2019t handle it. This is when I tried to text E. They only just left when I texted him so I expected him to maybe come back to make sure I was safe. When he didn\u2019t, I tried to call my mom but she left her phone at the house. I just said fuck it and now 45 days clean is completely down the drain. I was so mad and sad that I didn\u2019t even wait to take the blade out of the razor. I scraped it so hard agains my skin that here are burns. \n\nAnother problem is that my parents don\u2019t handle my self harm the best way. They threatened send me to a program whenever I do it and they said last time that the next time I do it, that they will. My parents are divorced and my mom, who is the most understanding about my self harm, is concerned that my dad will try to get full custody of me. I love my dad but I really don\u2019t want that. He is bipolar and doesn\u2019t handle things very well when he\u2019s mad. I\u2019ve learned to just shut up and let him yell at me. I can\u2019t cry anymore so when he yells at me I don\u2019t hyperventilate and ball my eyes out like I used to. For some reason that only made him way more angry. I\u2019m glad that I can\u2019t cry anymore for that reason. \n\nSo much is going on and I really just wanted to write it all down. I plan to self harm again tonight since I didn\u2019t do it very deep. I have a weird urge to want to cut to fat. I\u2019ve nicked fat before but definitely haven\u2019t gotten all the way down. I don\u2019t plan to go to fat tonight but if it happened I\u2019d probably be really proud of myself and I\u2019d feel relieved for a few minutes. A few minutes is all I need. I\u2019m tired of constantly suffering in silence. \n\n", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

For what I know, the odds to die from slicing a vein on your forearms are very low - I mean, you could die from severe anemia, infection, heart attack, but not for the cut itself, even if you're going to lose a lot of blood, right? So, she faints because of the blood loss, then she wakes up after a bit of time, presses a towel on the wound to stop the blood flow, ties it and lets it there for hours, because if she takes it off the blood will run again... given this case, is it possible to not get stitches, even if she hit a vein?\n\nI don't want to give bad suggestions to anyone who's currently struggling with self-harm.

I stopped because I found myself impatient to come home, so that I could cut, and I craved the way it felt whenever I was out. That scared me a lot, so I cut it down until I stopped cutting altogether, almost by accident. It stopped being something that I needed to do.\n\nI was pretty proud of myself, because it seemed like I was coming out of a place I'd been for several years. I wasn't sure who I was without the cutting, but I was ready to make some other changes in my life that have ultimately lead to me being very content with where I am now. I'm not ashamed of those scars, but I'm not upset that that part of my life is over -- I feel like I've moved forward, and I'm proud of who I'm becoming.\n\nAt least, I thought I was. Recently, I've been pretty upset and playing around with burning a little. Over the past two or three years, I've cut maybe once a year, mostly out of a rock bottom panic. After the fact, I feel a little bad, but it's not something I need to do anymore. More recently, I've been pretty off-kilter, and curious about burning, so I've done it a couple times. I've been looking up safe ways to do it, because I've heard bad things, and in my research I came across the fact that bruising is self harm.\n\nWeirdly enough, I never knew that. I guess I'd never read it anywhere, or seen it on anything. Cause in the four year interval from when I stopped cutting and present day, I would hit myself across the collarbone a couple times a day, more if I was upset or frustrated. I craved the way it felt, and it got to the point where I started being able to see the bruises on my chest, and where I had to move to different parts of my body because my collars were too bruised.\n\nI figured this was normal -- it wasn't leaving a mark, and sometimes people punch walls when they're frustrated or angry, so it was a totally normal thing to do, right?\n\nApparently, it wasn't, and I guess in all those years I was proud of myself for moving forward, I hadn't been moving at all.  I never stopped self-harming. I'm kinda shaken up, because everything I thought I was becoming -- more level headed, more confident, etc., everything that I associated with moving forward in my life, maybe that's not true. Maybe I'm still the same person I was four years ago, and I've just fooled myself. I was a cutter, then I bruised, and now I burn. I never stopped self harming, and I'm not moving forward. Am I? I don't know. Maybe I'm not changing.\n\nSorry for this weird venting post, it just completely blindsided me and I feel like I'm that kid from four years ago again. I feel like I don't know what the past four years were -- my view on them has completely shifted, and I don't know where I stand. It's okay, though. I'm not sure exactly where I am anymore, but I do know that if nothing else, I'm four years older and am capable of dealing with this accordingly. I've handled a lot of things, and I'll be fine.

This is my first thread here.\n\nSo, a little background story: I'm a 20 years old guy. I was always vulnerable to self-harm. I remember cutting myself first time when I was around 13, but those were just one-time occurences. I mean, I was not addicted to it, I just did it about 2-3 times a year when I felt really frustrated.\n\nHowever, in the last 6 months now, I started self-cutting and it somehow seems to work for me as some kind of remedy for my depression. The happenings of my past 6 months or so introduced me to a whole new level of depression. I was always sensitive to depression, due to many traumas I had as a kid (mostly family problems and tragedies) but this past 6 months is the worst so far. But after I cut myself like 4 or 5 times, I feel a great relieve. I know it might sound disgusting, but it almost feels like one would feel after sex. I feel like my problems are gone and I feel very calm and lightheaded.  I might look sick and disgusting now, but sometimes I even take pictures of my cuts and the blood that flows out, and looking at these pictures gives me some kind of euphory.\n\nAlthough this feeling lasts for usually a few hours, and after that, my depression is back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNevertheless, my question to you is: do you guys feel the same after self-cutting?

I'm doing it now every 4 to 6 months, which I'm a little proud of. But as the title suggests, I want to stop completely.\n\nDue to my afformentioned depression, I am pretty much numb 90% of the day, the remaining 10% being made up of stress and an overflow of different feelings - all building up a \"pressure\" in me that I give in every few months, by cutting myself. I've tried various things to fight this pressure but so far, to no avail.\n\nI tried concentration exercises to steer the mind away from the pressure, aswell as different kinds of stress relieving balls (soft ones to squish and harder ones with little spikes) and rubberbands you pull and release onto your wrist/arm. The latter got so excessive though, that I started bleeding from it, defeating the purpose.\n\nSo I'm asking here if anyone knows of anything else I could try. In general I'd love to hear stories of anyone that managed to stop and how.\n\nThanks for reading through my rambling and for any reply! ", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I would cut to briefly ground myself with pain, but I kept pushing myself to make deeper cuts. It was (is?) an incredibly skewed cycle of \"self-care\". Make deep cuts and then take care of them. Losing the distraction that came from methodical care during the healing process made me want to cut more. Cutting deeper lengthened the healing process, so, while I wasn't cutting as often, I was still doing a lot more damage. It turned into hurting myself just to see damage, then into hurting myself more trying to feel the effects of minor blood loss.

My emotions take over usually at night though, and everyone's asleep when i need someone to talk to the most.   \n\n\nCan anyone relate? or give me ideas for solutions?  \n\n\n(I have had many different therapists and they stop sessions because they think I've gotten better, but i just needed someone to vent to. and they left.)", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Most recently, I found a cartridge with 5-6 in it hidden in the night stand, but instead of throwing them away, I hid them in a bathroom cabinet, out of sight, because some subconscious part of me wanted to have them for if I ever needed them. \n\nI can\u2019t really say I\u2019ve self harmed in the past - the last time i did it was a few years ago, with a really dull pocket knife that didn\u2019t leave any scars.

The only thing stopping me is that I don\u2019t want my boyfriend to see my cuts because I don\u2019t want him to relapse again. It\u2019s unavoidable that he will see them bc we see each other naked all the time.\n\nIdk. I\u2019ve been feeling really shitty and can\u2019t really explain why and it\u2019s really frustrating.

The feeling of comfort, relaxation, and peace. I usually cut to punish myself for all of my mistakes, but it's getting to the point where I want to do this all of the time. I just want to apologise to everyone that I have damaged in my life one final time before I die (I chickened out if Suicide before, because I was too scared. Nine times). This monster has hurt too many souls to keep moving any longer. Just say the words and the big bad monster will vanish before your eyes.

I was so close in the past, many, many times, but I always managed to hold myself back. But not this time. This time, I cracked. Heavy snow, cancelled date, winter blues, felt horrible, cried a lot, felt no catharsis. Needed a release, some release, any release. I was hurting, I was in tears, but the tears weren't helping, not this time, this time they weren't enough. A voice in my head was screaming \u201cThis is a moment of suffering, you have to acknowledge that, and you must choose to approach yourself with compassion. Please, don\u2019t do this.\u201d But. The mirror next to my chair, I caught a glimpse of myself, forehead scrunched up in agony, tears streaming down my face, makeup running in ruins, soft whimpers escaping my mouth...I looked pathetic. I felt like garbage. I needed to feel something else, anything else. I gave in.\n\nDidn\u2019t have time to get to the kitchen, I worried that I might lose the nerve if I didn\u2019t do it right then and there in that moment. Eyebrow scissors next to the mirror, thin sharp blades. Not as good as a razor, but it would have to do. Left arm, I'm right handed, didn\u2019t wanna fall further behind in art homework. I pressed the tip into the skin, and raked it across, just a few inches long. No blood, a shallow wound, tearing skin but not cutting through it. Blood would have been better, but this was still quite enough. The emotional pain seared off in a flash, the sadness evaporated in a rush of adrenaline. It felt good. It felt unimaginably good. It was incredible. I wanted more. Another cut. And another. And a fourth. Deeper, longer, harder each time.\n\nThe moment was over. The sadness was gone, the initial rush was gone. A sharp burning pain was all that was left. I wanted to keep going, to keep feeling more of that rush, just a few extra seconds of that ecstasy if I could. But that voice in my head broke through. I realised what I had done, I realised that I had fucked up. I put the scissors away and dried my tears. I had to tell someone. I did. I reached out to friends. I reached out to my therapist. I am reaching out to you guys. I have a therapy session coming up in a few days, our main focus has been night terrors and panic attacks due to PTSD from my abusive family. I've moved away, I'm safe now, I'm healing now. Or at least, I was healing, until tonight. We're gonna focus on self-harm in our next session. I am hoping that this won't become a pattern, but tbh it's already too late. I did it again this morning. And again, this afternoon. I know it's wrong, but...it just feels so good.
