But I did go through this stage where I'd make myself throw up as a sort of \"punishment\". I'd self harm for many reasons and \"punishment\" was one of them. Like if I felt bad or wasn't productive, said something shitty I'd either cut or throw up. I never did it to lose weight so to me it doesn't sound at all like bulimia. I liked the feeling of being physically empty and violent act of vomiting and the sour taste also made me feel better in a sick and twisted way. Also, I'm doing much better now so need to be concerned.

I did not mean to cut that deep at all but it was dark and I was having a panic attack on the side of the road after running out of my church building freaking out... my legs were basically numb and I couldn\u2019t even see/feel what I was doing. And then I didn\u2019t go home for another two hours because when my mom (bless her soul for finding me) picked me up on the side of the road we immediately had to take my cat to the vet because she was very sick so I just kind of bled all over myself for a couple hours. \n\nIt was so deep I could see fat but I really did NOT want my mom to see anything that scary on her own kid and didn\u2019t want to go to the hospital because they\u2019d keep me for heaven knows how long  and it would screw up my schooling.  \n\nThat thing took months to heal. By some miracle me tending on my own with tons of gauze and antibiotic was enough to keep it from ever getting infected.  About two months later it still wasn\u2019t totally healed  and I broke that leg and the swelling from the break re-opened it. I\u2019m just so lucky none of my doctors really questioned how I got it in the first place. \n\nAnyways, there\u2019s this big sort of crevice in my leg now. It\u2019s gotten a lot shallower over time but even as my old scars fade, the dent is still there. I wish I got stitches.  \n", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

You could barely tell anything happened they were very light but deep down I knew that I shouldnt have  done it and I regretted it but it\u2019s an addiction once you start you can\u2019t stop and it\u2019s really the truth I would cut every day after school no matter if my parents were home or they weren\u2019t home it got really bad and could tell by looking at my wrists that I cut.I stopped for one day eventually I told my best friend Anna  she was shocked but was very supportive and I love her so much for that I\u2019m glad that she always stick by my side and helped me out a lot she told me if I had an urge to call her to text her she was just so great and I\u2019m so thankful that shes still in my life now so eventually school was getting worse I was so tired sometimes I couldn\u2019t even get out of my bed and I don\u2019t even know why I was sad it was just kind of like I was empty and lonely and felt worthless  and didn\u2019t have any emotion and I would just sit down in my bed and cry  and listen to lil peep and Billie Ellish and I wondered why I couldn\u2019t be happy again and I wondered why things ended up like this and it just got really bad to the point where I couldn\u2019t control it anymore and anytime I would video chat with my best friend she always asked to  see my cuts  I know she was only doing it to see how much damage it was it made me feel like she did care but at the same time I didn\u2019t \u2019t want to show her sometimes because I was afraid she would judge me but she didn\u2019t  she understood my pain that I was going through she was just such an amazing best friend and I was so sad that she lived so far away from me So I decided to tell my mom about my cutting we were in the car  I also made a second friend which was great but one day I was sitting next to her and I noticed that she cut and I asked her and she told me that she does cut I finally told my mom and said I need to tell you something and she ok? And I said I\u2019m having a hard time I don\u2019t know how to handle it so I self harmed. she was like are you dumb why would you do that yourself?  she was like you matter so much to me and your dad I don\u2019t understand why you would do that after that I told her that I wanted help and I wanted to get better she said OK and that was the end of the conversation we drove eventually to the place that we went to and as we were coming home she didn\u2019t talk anything about it I wasn\u2019t sure why but then a month went by I was still cutting doing the same thing I couldn\u2019t stop it was like a cycle of sadness and feeling depressed lonely Numb. so my sister had a wedding I loved it it was great I had to wear a dress and I was very scared cause I didn\u2019t want no one to see My cut so I put makeup on them so no one could see. No one asked me or even questioned me I was  shocked.   \n\nso my dad drank way too much  he\u2019s an alcoholic to be honest my mom said let\u2019s go we\u2019re leaving say bye to the family and I said OK I said bye to my cousin who I was very very close with we had so much fun at the wedding. I thought my mom is going to drive because my dad was not able to drive he was not Sober enough, to drive and he should not have drove we got in the car packed everything up I sat in the backseat.My mom sat  in the front I told my mom you should drive because dad is drunk and I said he\u2019s not sober so he shouldn\u2019t drive she told me OK I was thinking she is going to drive. Well definitely not what  she did my dad got in the driver seat and drove and I said Mom why aren\u2019t you driving she said your dad wanted to drive and I said OK whatever, she knew I was pissed I was angry and sad at the same time because I don\u2019t like see my dad like that he\u2019s a great person when he\u2019s not drunk. We got on the road and my dad was going way past the speeding limit the speed limit was I think 45 or 55 along that line,I don\u2019t really remember but I definitely know it wasn\u2019t 100 or 90 so in his car he has a thing where it says you\u2019re going over the speed limit in the car it\u2019s like it\u2019s hard to explain.But it\u2019s this little like monitor for your speed and it kept going off because he was going like 90 or hundred which wasn\u2019t 45 or 55, at all I started to notice I was having an Anxiety attack I was having a hard time breathing and I was shaking I was crying because I thought I was gonna die and I was scared we were going to crash. My dad had road rage and it just wasn\u2019t  good makes especially when he was drunk.\n\nThere was this motorcycle that was driving in correctly apparently and my dad honked and he started yelling out the window and it was really, bad and I started crying and my dad noticed he pulled over and was like you should drive to my mom and my mom was like no it\u2019s fine like let\u2019s just get home and he got out of the car and he screamed he was just throwing a huge tantrum and I remember it like it was yesterday and my mom said get back in the car and my dad wouldn\u2019t do it so my mom got out and said what\u2019s going on and he was just like your daughter is crying and I don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s crying and my mom is like you\u2019re scaring her that\u2019s why do you know when he got even more angry and start yelling he finally got back in the car I was sitting in the car while all this was happening and he got in the car he slammed the door and he\u2019s continue to drive my mom did not take over and my mom was like shut up don\u2019t say anything and I was like why are you driving and she was like I\u2019m sorry so he\u2019s driving us in the car he noticed that I\u2019m crying because I\u2019m having an Anxiety attack and my dad he starts yelling at me and says why the fuck are you crying and I said you\u2019re going over the speed limit and you\u2019re drunk why do you think I\u2019m crying and he was like I\u2019m sober as can be and I was like but you\u2019re still going over the speed limit and he was like no I\u2019m not so then he continues to yell at me and he goes why do you play these games and I just sat there and was quiet and kept crying and I didn\u2019t know what to do you know there\u2019s not much you can do that situation we finally got home I will slam my door in my room I calmed myself down and the first thing that I did after I wash my face was I grabbed a blade and I cut now I\u2019ve never cut with blades it was always a pocket knife and I cut pretty deep to where it started bleeding and my cuts never bled they were very light cuts but you could still tell that I cut because there would be a mark  but that night I just went overboard I was in so much pain and rage and sadness because I felt like I I kept playing these games apparently and I wasn\u2019t  a good daughter and I took it out on myself and I felt like I was fat I was ugly I was disgusting like who gives a shit I\u2019m worthless you know that\u2019s automatically what I thought because of what my dad said he says that I play all these games and I just took it out on myself and I just kept cutting there were like 10 slits on one of my wrist and it\u2019s like five on my other wrist so then the next day I woke up I was mad and I went to my moms room and I said why didn\u2019t you drive I was like you hurt my feelings and she was like what do you want me to do I can\u2019t do anything it\u2019s done and over with and I was like OK just know I\u2019m mad at you do you not she would take a hint because you I  told Her  that cut so I don\u2019t know why she like wouldn\u2019t ask me or like be concerned she didn\u2019t care then the next day I felt like no one cared about me I wanted to die I want it to just slit myself to where I wouldn\u2019t be able to live anymore I was done I feel like there\u2019s no meaning in my life I\u2019m worthless no one cares no one ever cared so what\u2019s the point so I cut again with the blade eventually I told my Best friend and she said I\u2019m so sorry I don\u2019t know what to tell you I just hope that you feel better and I was thinking like there\u2019s nothing she can do I was like I should just throw the blade and pocket knife away so I threw both of them away and  I told myself I\u2019m going to start fresh  and new but deep down I felt a huge cloud of sadness and emptiness. \n\n All the sudden I got a huge urge and I didn\u2019t know what to do you don\u2019t really think when you\u2019re in that situation so I automatically went through the trash to find the blade  in the pocket knife but I couldn\u2019t find it so I went back in my house and I have got this artist set for drawing And I found a sharpener with two blades I only used one I grabbed a hammer and I smashed the screw off and I grab the blade and I cut their were About 20 cuts  all together and one cut Started bleeding really bad and I was in a panic so I automatically put pressure on it so it would stop the bleeding eventually it stopped so my mom came home and she got a rat for my snake and we are both trying to feed the snake she wouldn\u2019t eat and I went to my mom and she noticed my wrist and she said have you been cutting again and I started breaking down crying and I told her yeah I was like I told you I wanted help and I want to go to therapy but you didn\u2019t listen to me and she was like I didn\u2019t think it was that bad. And I told her don\u2019t tell dad because my dad doesn\u2019t know How to handle things and she said OK well I said I\u2019m gonna go back into the house and grab a sweater so he won\u2019t see my cuts and she said OK\n\nAnd as I have my yellow sweater on my dad was like I thought you had a report and I was like yeah and he was like do you want me to help you and I was like sure so we\u2019re sitting down and we\u2019re doing the report and I finally finish and I went to the living room I said you didn\u2019t tell him right and she said no and I said OK and all the sudden my dad went into my room and said will you take your sweater off and I said why he was like just take it off and I said OK I took it off and he saw the cuts on both my wrists and he said why would you do this and I said I don\u2019t know I was like I was so sad and depressed and he was like why are you depressed you have nothing to be depressed about and I said I know it just happened and he was like you\u2019re so beautiful why would you do this to your body and I said I don\u2019t like myself I said I hate myself I said I hate my body I think I\u2019m fat I think I\u2019m ugly And I feel worthless and I was like I don\u2019t know how to handle it so I took it out of myself and I punished myself. \n\nAnd he took it calmly for the first part but then it went from being good to him trying to help me out to him not caring and he walked out of the door and on the way out he slammed it and I started crying and my moms like calm down it\u2019s OK and I was like you\u2019ve lied to me I was like you told me you were going to tell him and I was like I knew this was gonna happen and she\u2019s like it\u2019s his decision he walked out don\u2019t worry about it she\u2019s like do you want to eat and yeah as I sat down and ate I finished and I went to watch a movie and all the sudden I heard the door open and he slammed the door so hard and he started yelling and he was like I can\u2019t believe you would do this like you\u2019re beautiful I don\u2019t understand and he just kept yelling at me and he was like you\u2019re not in the correct mind state he was like you have so many problems then he was like maybe I should drive you down to the mental hospital and I just sat there and I just kept thinking wow  he really doesn\u2019t care and I was like I am really worthless and he was like what what am I supposed to do and I said take me to therapy movie that will help and he said so talking to a stranger about your problems gonna help and, Then he said she\u2019s just gonna put you in a mental hospital what\u2019s the point and my mom said she\u2019s right she can tell her therapist anything and sometimes that\u2019s what they need  he was like you can tell me anything and I was like are you sure because right now you know doesn\u2019t seem like I can tell you anything because of the way that you\u2019re reacting and he was just so against therapy and I never understood it   And at that moment I wanted to die because I wouldn\u2019t have to be in that situation and I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about it eventually he calm down and he removed everything that was sharp in the yard which was good I guess and then he asked me do I have a blade and I said no I said I threw it away in the trash and I lied to him because I still have that other blade and I said how can I go feed the dragon this because I have a bearded dragon you know and there was no more worms left in the container and there was \n\nBedding in it for the worms and I put  the blade in there and I threw it in the trash So then they went in search my room and they didn\u2019t find anything and they wouldn\u2019t let me sleep in my own bed so I had to sleep on the couch eventually I said I can\u2019t sleep I need to go to my own room and they let me and they said have the door open and you\u2019re not gonna sleep with the door closed and I said OK that\u2019s fine and my mom was like you don\u2019t have anything to cut with Right and I was like no but I have a shaver and just in case I have an urge you should take it and she was like OK and she took it. \n\nThe next morning I woke up went to school came home and I was definitely her from what my dad said and how he over reacted in my opinion he could\u2019ve took in a little bit more calmly but he didn\u2019t so he said I\u2019m sorry I never meant to do that to you and he was like I think we should take you to therapy and I said OK thanks I went on with my day did my homework but I had to stay outside of my room and not inside my room because typically I would just stay in my room and sleep all day and be sad and depressed and I felt like one day I was just like die in my room because I was in my room so much but eventually I got out of my room because they wouldn\u2019t let me be in it. \n\nAnd then and then the next morning it was a Sunday and my mom said you have therapy tomorrow and I was scared because I thought the therapist was going to put me in a mental hospital because my dad mentioned that and it definitely scared me so then Monday came along that was rough I was terrified to go but I got  in the office where I am at my therapist her name was Pamela she was so nice and she was like you seem very nervous and I said yeah I was like, she was like why is that and I explain to her the situation and then I said because my dad said that you would put me in a mental hospital and she said no we try everything in our power to help you before we consider putting you in one and I said OK then the session was very short because she was just getting to know me and what was going on and eventually towards the end of the session she brought in my mom and my dad because they both went with me and she said your daughter has clinical depression and anxiety and she said I\u2019m gonna put you in counseling she was like do you want to switch to a different therapist and I said no and she said OK I will see you in two weeks she gave us the time and the date my next session rolled around and I was clean for those two weeks then we booked another schedule in two weeks again and my dad started drinking very very badly and I hate seeing him like that and I felt like a shitty daughter because there was nothing I could do and I took it out on myself and I grabbed a shaver because my mom thought I was clean for like two weeks she said OK here\u2019s your shaverBecause I was doing really good then all the sudden I relapsed I was in the tub thinking about everything that happened that night just my dads drinking and then on top of that I was hating on myself and and I told myself you\u2019re ugly you\u2019re not beautiful you\u2019re fat you\u2019re worthless no one cares you should just slit your wrists so that\u2019s what I did I did two cuts on my thighs and five on my wrist and\n\n the next day I went to school and I told my boyfriend because he\u2019s always there for me and that it was easier to tell him first then I told Anna my best friend that\u2019s the one that was anonymous but she let me put her name in and I told her and she said you should definitely tell your mom and I said I can\u2019t she\u2019ll be so mad at me because I was doing so good and she said please do it for me and I did it because I didn\u2019t want to lie to my mom because I felt guilty and also because of Anna and I told my mom and the car started breaking down crying and she was like you were doing so good what happened and she was like I can\u2019t believe you would do this and then she said do you know if you keep doing this you\u2019re going to hit a veinAnd then we\u2019re gonna have to take you to the hospital to get stitches and she said this is not right don\u2019t do this and I said won\u2019t I promise I Said but you can\u2019t tell Dad and she said OK I won\u2019t after that I told Anna and she  was like I\u2019m so proud of you that\u2019s great and then I told her what my mom said and she was like well it\u2019s true she\u2019s like if you do continue to do this you\u2019re going to hit a vein and I said I know So one day my mom couldn\u2019t pick me up from school and my dad wasn\u2019t home so my grandpa pick me up and my mom told him to keep me at their house and not to leave me alone at my house because like her and she said don\u2019t tell anyone and he said I won\u2019t then another month pass by I was  clean \n\nthen my dad came home drunk from my grandpas house and I was cleaning out the snake cage and my dad was there and all the sudden he grabbed me and he looked at my wrists and he didn\u2019t see anything because I was clean for like two months now and he was like why don\u2019t I see anything and I said because I\u2019ve been clean for a while now and he said you\u2019re such a liar and I said no and he was like you\u2019ve been cutting somewhere else haven\u2019t you you liar you\u2019re just gonna lie to my face and I said I haven\u2019t and I ran into the house and my mom is there and she was sitting on the couch and I started breaking down crying like the hardest I\u2019ve ever cried because I felt so ashamed of what I did and I regretted every single moment that I can\u2019t and I started having an Anxiety attack I was shaking I could barely catch my breath and I was bawling my eyes out and all the sudden my dad came in and was super pissed because I never told him and he started yelling at me and was like why would you do this to yourself and I said because I hate myself and also because of your drinking I was like it makes me feel bad about myself makes me feel like I\u2019m not good enough and he\u2019s like so that\u2019s an excuse so if I\u2019m not feeling good enough I can just go slit my wrists  and I said I never said it was an excuse and then I said it was wrong of you to look at my wrist and I said I even talk to my therapist about this and I said it gives me anxiety and my dad said so now i\u2019m your anxiety and I said I never said that I said you\u2019re putting words in my mouth and all the sudden he was like you have so many problems and he was like your therapist can\u2019t even fix it and I said you know what don\u2019t act like you\u2019re perfect because you\u2019re not I said no one\u2019s perfect I said at least I admit to my problems and he got so mad he flipped over the couch and left a hole in the wall where the couch was at  and I said This is why don\u2019t tell you stuff because you act like this and he was like like a concerned parent I said no I said you get angry you start throwing a fit I said this is not how you\u2019re supposed to react and I said I need you to be there for me not Yellit m this is why don\u2019t tell you stuff because you act like this and he was like like a concerned parent I said no I said you get angry you start throwing a fit I said this is not how you\u2019re supposed to react and I said I need you to be there for me not Yell at me tell me how many problems I have I was like you have problems too and he was like what problems and I said do you have a drinking problem I said you won\u2019t admit to it but you do I said I\u2019m getting help and you\u2019re not so don\u2019t tell me that my therapist can\u2019t fix my problems because I was doing good until this happened \n\nAnd I went to bed he took my iPad because he thought it was gonna make a huge difference but he tried to look for my phone but I hid it from him and he was like so you can lie to me about this too and he called it my phone was on silent and he just took my iPad and that was it like I said I went to bed and the next day I was expecting an apology because that\u2019s what you did last time but nope and my wonderful cousin had me over and I got to leave the house for three days and through all of this my best friend Anna was always there for me Along with my cousin and my sisters and Anna talk to me the next day And was just talking it out with me and was telling me to not feel bad about what I said because I need to say it and she made me feel like it wasn\u2019t my fault and that I was in a bad person because of What I said to my dad. \n\nI spent one night at my cousins house and I talked it out with him but we went to the mall we had a wonderful time and I Wasn\u2019t worried at all and it was so nice to just be out of the house and not be as sad and me and my cousin became super close and My cousin was just super supportive and anytime I would be sad I would always text him and he would always be there for me and with Anna\ud83e\udd70 it was the same thing we were extremely closer and I would text her about anything and she would always help me out and then the next two days I spent with my sister now I told her about everything that was happening and she looked at me dead in the eyes and said you\u2019re so strong Especially when you\u2019re going through all that stuff I don\u2019t know if I would be able to handle it as well as you did and that made me feel so good and so proud of myself and just that little words of inspiration made me feel great I was like oh I can totally do this like speaker got it you know especially when you\u2019re going through all that stuff I don\u2019t know if I would be able to handle it as well as you did and that made me feel so good and so proud of myself and just that little words of inspiration made me feel great I was like oh I can totally do this like yeessssss and eventually it was getting better every day occasionally I would have mental breakdowns but my cousin was always there to cheer me up or to FaceTime me or to just write me a paragraph telling me how much I matter and do not worry about other people he was just so supportive and has help me so much and same with Anna she would talk to me every single day and would ask me how I was doing and when I was sad I would tell her and she would just be there immediately no matter if she was doing something and she just talk to me and it was great because I had my support systems  and in conclusion I just want to let you guys know that you\u2019re not alone and it\u2019s extremely hard to stop self harming but you can do it I have been clean for about three weeks now and I\u2019ve been super happy lately it\u2019s just been great and it\u2019s so nice to feel happy again and to feel like I actually matter and that maybe I\u2019m not ugly and I\u2019m slowly Gaining my confidence back but just know That no matter what you\u2019re not worth less and that you are amazing and you are beautiful and it\u2019s not easy it takes time but eventually you will stop and you will be so happy that you stopped and I just wanted to share my story because I want to make sure that people didn\u2019t feel like there alone because  there are so many people that are going through similar situations and you\u2019re never alone.\u2764\ufe0f", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

She also believed that you cannot kill yourself cutting across your wrist. But I had schooled her about so much shit. She doesn't know I cut and the funny part is that I sit next to her with my bare arms and I have visible cuts and scars. She was so shocked when I told her about how \"It is impossible to hurt yourself unless you are a psycho\" was wrong.  I wanted to tell her I can prove you can hurt yourself.

I just need to vent (?) I am as close as I have ever been to full remission from depression. But this last week, I've been slowly growing more and more depressed. I ended up cutting on New Years (I mean, like at 4am so 2019, i think) I was drunk and I gave myself my worst cut. But it really was superficial (like I knew that), it was just one that I couldn't close with butterfly bandages. I wasn't sure, so I went to the ER (I know, stupid of me, even though the doctor said I did the right thing and I got great insurance). Best thing of it all: I got a tetnus shot. But I still can't shake the depressed feeling. And I just want to cut myself. I feel so low, and I just realized, I will never be the same person I used to be. I've been procrastinating on this one project and have tried to take care of everything instead of it. I've lost myself somewhere. I didn't realize it until now. I just slowly faded away. In some ways thats okay, but I can't tell if I've matured or I've just become more cynical and hopeless. And I don't think I'll ever be in \"total remission\". I just want to cut myself all over. All over. All, All, Alll freaking over.\n\nthe number one trigger this week: thinking of the future. And the future is something, even at my best, I can't believe in. And sometimes I cut myself because I feel like I can't handle the future. And yeah, I try to live day by day, but if you are applying for financial aid, study abroad, internships, and a progressive degree (getting a Masters and B.A. in five years total) it's impossible to think in the short term.  Oh, and guess what. I have to take a full course load to even have a chance to go for the masters. I don't think I can do this. I don't think I can survive this. I'm sure I'll survive for the next few months. But every semester is the same. Beginning is nearly suicidal, middle is suicidal, and end may or may not be depressed/suicidal. I'm in therapy, but someday i won't. I know I got things pretty good, but my anxiety and sleep issues are slowly leeching me of what I want and could do.

I AM NOT SELF DIAGNOSING MYSELF WITH DEPRESSION. THAT IS DANGEROUS AND UNACCEPTABLE !!!! But I am diagnosed with Anxiety. I have not been diagnosed with depression but I want to get it tested. So last night I was up on reddit like I usually am. I was listening to NF and just browsing when at like 3 AM I got a wave of panic. I don't even know why. I opened my pocket knife and was very paranoid. I think I fell asleep soon after that. Before that, though, my sister was downstairs (1 AM) and she was eating MnM's that I'm pretty sure were mine so I said \"I feel like you're eating my food\" and she said \"I feel like YOU'RE eating MY food.\" and Idk man I just felt so depressed with her saying that that I said \"It's ok... you can have them\". Fast forward to like 20 minutes ago we were fighting and she spilled my hot chocolate on me and pushed me against my brothers bed and yelled at me saying it's MY fault we don't have a good relationship and I'm the one to blame for this. I cut wide. I don't know how wide it was but I'm actually kind of scared of infection since I've just been using two bandages (now that have lot's of bloodstains) and I ran out of bandaids a while ago. I keep thinking: It is my fault. My best friend probably wouldnt care if I killed myself and my parents only use me to do household chores. I know the part about the parents isn't true but I'm just an ungrateful retard who can't even  get good grades in school. When my mom found out about my sister cutting she tried to take her to a mental hospital and I can't have that. I try with my school studies and I can't let that interfere. In the argument my sister kept interrupting and she wouldnt even let me apologize. I felt like she was just dismissing my pain and my points. She has all the right to do that since it's my fault in the first place. With the \"friend\" I told he said \"You already tried to commit suicide\" when I made an edgy joke in  the group chat. If he really thinks that my self harm is a suicide attempt and he doesn't even make a damn  effort to report it or help me, it makes me believe he probably doesnt even care for my well being at all.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Also, having the anesthesia doc greet you with a friendly \"Oh, hello Owl, sorry to see you again\" is kind of awkward.

But I think about hurting myself a lot still, and I keep my razors in my bag and cut myself maybe once every week or two? I also pick my skin and I like the pain. In a fucked up way, I love it because it makes me feel high and stress free. Nobody knows I still do it and Im embarrassed because I know it's wrong.

Just over a year ago her Mum had an affair with a married man, it was all very complicated as she was the child care worker for the mans little girl from his new marriage and his wife was pregnant at the time. I moved out with my children in to a new home and we started again. Her mum has her 2 days per week and every second weekend. She kept our old home and turned it in to a full time day care centre for children and promptly moved my children in with him when they are with her.\n\nMy daughter hates going there but does so as she misses her mum. The affair partner sounds very controlling and to be honest rather nasty in a sort of underhanded way. He regularly says strange things to her such as saying I\u2019m a bad parent and don\u2019t know how to discipline my children, he tells her she needs to make her mummy happy or he will stop her seeing his little girl again. He bet her money to eat a whole chilli from the garden which made her ill.\n\nI noticed last year she began biting her fingers quite hard and we had a chat about it. She has now began using needles to scratch her fingers and they look very painful, when questioned by anyone she says she burnt them on the kettle. We\u2019ve always had a very close bond, especially when her Mum originally abandoned us. She has opened up to me about it and I have to say I\u2019m unsure what to do. I\u2019ve asked her to stop and sat and listened to how unhappy she is when she visits with her Mum, but despite my pleas to her to consider staying home more she insists she wants to go as she misses her mummy.\n\nI have to be very careful how I handle the situation and who I can confide in, as when I\u2019ve reported issues in the past and shared with her school or her mum, she is then disciplined for sharing problems with me by her mum and she clams up for weeks at a time. I want her to know she can share things with me without the worry of her mum finding out she\u2019s told me these things. It really does feel like I\u2019m stuck between a rock and a hard place. I recognise these issues are arising when she visits her mum but I\u2019m not in a position to stop this. If I try the legal route then this may make her feel worse as I\u2019m keeping her from her Mum. My son has suffered a lot too when he\u2019s there, they both prefer to be home with me but as you can imagine they love their mum very much and miss her.\n\nSo, what can I do to help her find a way to let out the pain she is feeling instead of resolving to self harm?\n\nI apologise that I have no knowledge or understanding of self harm. I\u2019m trying to learn more about this and what steps I can take to help her... ", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

{"post_id": "adccir", "created_utc": 1546823819, "title": "Relapsed last night after a year of being clean...", "author": "Iiwets", "self_text": "I been dealing with depression, anxiety, and self harm for a while, but it felt as though I kicked my SH habit, mostly replacing it with weed. However, the fogginess in my brain that weed gives me is causing me to fall behind in college, so for 2019 I decided to give up smoking. My (ex)girlfriend of 5 months also broke up with me in mid December, and that hurt a lot.\n\n\n\n**Background:**\n\nHer and I met in the fall of 2017 in our first semester of college. We lived in the same dorm and quickly bonded over similar music taste. We became best friends and she even gave me a stick and poke tattoo of the Sagittarius symbol, my astrology sign, on my thigh. To me, that tattoo was a symbol of how happy I was at college, unbeknownst to me, the elation would only last for that semester...\n\nWe began hooking up for a week or two and then abruptly stopped, but the friendship was still strong. It stayed that way for about year, until this summer, when we both confessed our love for each other. She was my first love, but despite that, she still caused me pain. Over the five months of dating, she broke up with me twice, the second one being the final time.... so far... she has started hinting at maybe picking things back up upon return from winter break.\n\nThis has been a complicated time for me and my emotions have been all over the place. I have been actively working to combat my depression and I've been seeing great improvements, but I've also had to fend off very close counters with taking my own life (last night being one of those, which I will get to at the bottom if you'd rather skip to that). I hadn't cut myself since Finals of Fall 2017 and I had been working on creating a more rigid daily routine, which was boosting my outlook on life. \n\nOn all levels, I want her back. I still love her. Why wouldn't I? I didn't want things to end, she was the one who broke up with me. However, I also know shes not good for me. During our most recent break up I reach insane levels of instability and irrationality. These feelings were brought on by a specific incident; when she came to my dorm room, drunk at 3am one night in December.  This was a couple days after she had broken up with me. \n\nShe had ended things because she questioning everything and didn't feel like she was in the right place. She wanted to work on herself. However, these feelings were not long-lasting and the very next morning she texted me, telling me she had made a mistake. I held my ground and told her I'd consider restarting the relationship, but not until after we had some time away from each other to think. We still kept in semi-frequent contact. Things were cordial, but not flirtatious in anyway. \n\n**One of the worst nights of my life:**\n\nThe night she had come over, she had texted me saying she has a few more things she wants to say and would like to come over to my dorm room. I didn't respond until about 8 or 9 pm saying, \"Sure, come over.\" She didn't respond until about 2am, asking if it was still okay to come over. I  was sober and naively said yes, because it was a weekday and I wasn't expecting her to be drunk.\n\nShe shows up around 2:30/3:00 am, and I can tell she has drank, which she admitted to. She was being very flirtatious and trying to make some moves (wanting to sit in my lap, etc.). I declined and told her it would be best if she would go home, and then offered to drive her back to her dorm, as I was sober. Halfway into the car ride she begins sobbing, explaining how shitty she feels. I begin to console her, but at this time, I was aware that it was not in my interest to take her back, despite every neuron in my brain telling me to do so. It wasn't long before I was sobbing uncontrollably, to a point where she stopped crying, realizing how fucked up of a situation she put me in. We sat outside her dorm in my car for like 15 minutes, all the while I'm crying. She eventually leaves, but I don't stop crying. Through my tears I start to drive back to my dorm, and, despite her absence, my mental state continue to deteriorate. Had it not been for my 1.5+ years of training with my therapist I am confident I would have drove my car into a pole. But I was able to recognize my downward spiral and put a stop to it. I park the car and walked the rest of the way to my dorm. This was by far my most unstable night.\n\nShe apologized the next morning, but I was never able to get over how inconsiderate she was of my feelings, mostly because she is aware of my mental state. Even knowing that she acted the way she did.\n\n**Last Night:**\n\nLast night was entirely my fault, I got really drunk and consequently, depressed. For the past month, I've been tripping myself up over this tattoo she gave me, a constant reminder of her. I hit a breaking point and just wanted it gone. I dismantled one of my razor heads as I had done before and went to work disfiguring the small tattoo on my thigh. The cuts ranged in depth, one in particular is deep, but none are serious enough to cause concern. I can't count how many I did, probably 15-20 on the tattoo itself. But that wasn't enough for drunk me... After I was satisfied with my work on the tattoo, I carved \"Fuck you\" adjacent to the slashed tattoo. \n\nI remember cutting my thigh, but I don't remember who the 'you' was referring to, me or her. I have a feeling it was me. I wrote it upside-down on my thigh, so it's legible from my perspective, but upside-down from an outsider's perspective. And I can't imagine saying \"fuck you\" to her, I still fucking love her man...\n\nI feel pretty shitty about relapsing... I was making such great strides and I really didn't see this coming. And besides, now I'm gonna have to explain to future girls why \"fuck you\" is carved next to a slashed tattoo on my thigh.\n\n\nIf you read this, thank you. I just needed to get this off my chest. I'm not giving up on making my life better, but god dammit this shit is hard.\n\nIf anyone wants to chat, I'll probably be active for the rest of the night. I just finished my 4th beer, but I'm done after this. We don't don't even have to chat about this, I got some gnarly music recommendations and I'll be playing Old School Runescape all night.\n", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I have very bad scars all up and down my calves (on the inside of my calves). I go to a school in a country that is hot all year, meaning my school uniform is a skirt that goes down to about the top of my knees, which means I can't cover the scars up with clothes when I am at school. Long socks are not an option as they are against the school rules (I would probably get made to take them off) and it is so hot that my legs would be super boiling all the time. Since my open wounds healed, I have been putting masking tape over the skin with scars every day. It looks like a thick white line on the inside of both calves, and is not super noticeable unless you are looking right down at my legs. However, the masking tape idea is completely unsustainable because it both attracts attention and is super bad for my skin, and also doesn't help the scars heal well. I also can't just show my scars because they are big and red and horrible and I absolutely would not be able to cope with attention/questions I would get at this point, especially since I've only told my absolute closest friends.

I spent the two year clean anniversary contemplating just falling back on the habit of cutting every night, but I didn't because ultimately what's kept me from doing anything again is fear of being sectioned again and for longer and a fear of letting people down. I don't know what got me to finally do it again last night, didn't even realise it was exactly an extra month clean until afterwards, I just started with a tiny scratch and then when I saw it I went again but slightly harder again and again until it hit me what had happened and I'd stopped... Come tonight and my brain locks onto the thought of doing it again and eventually I do. I'm terrified it's going to start being a regular thing again but then a sick part of me wants it to become a regular thing again just because I get the biggest immediate wave of relief directly afterwards and the endorphins are great and if I could just keep going without having to stop and feel guilty I could well be in bliss. This shit is almost an addiction to me, fuck it probably is a minor addiction and Ive just gone and gotten myself back into it and I'm so stuck between being guilt and... The sick feeling of relief that still slightly persists and the knowledge that I no longer have 2 years behind me of not doing it makes it so much easier to keep going.... \n\nI don't even know how to ask for support this time around because to me self harm is very much and embarrassing thing that should be of my past and should be left behind with the rest of the standard pre/early teen cringe but it's back and even with people I could easily feel comfortable talking about other deep topics, even suicidality, I can't bring myself to talk about self harm beyond a small disguised call for help to one person I trust that kinda just went undetected because it was too disguised and the person normally needs full out bluntness to pick up on stuff. I have a counselling session tomorrow and I don't know if I can tell the counselor just because of that fear of being returned to the hospital, even if that probably wouldn't happen this time around. I just wish it was easier for.me to bring my struggling up in conversation and get a tiny amount of support but I'm so used to hiding stuff and am generated pretty rubbish at communication on easy topics that there's no way I can do it.

Apologies in advanced if this seems scrambled, I\u2019m just a little lost. Since I have a difficult time opening up to people about this topic, Reddit seems like like the best place for some insight. Thank you, everyone in this community, for being so accepting and kind! \n\nI\u2019m a senior in highschool, graduating this year. When I first got the impulse to self-harm (around September last year), it was a very emotionally distressing experience. I used a random pair of shitty scissors and pressed it against my skin, and I did it because I felt like a disappointment. To my family, to my friends, to everyone around me\u2014so I felt like I needed to \u2018punish\u2019 myself, which sounds really stupid. The fact that I have a normal family life, parents that care about me, and no excuse to want to mutilate myself, made me feel worse. But I did it anyways, now it\u2019s become a bad habit. The more I relapsed and cut myself, the more apathetic I grew. Nowadays when I self-harm, it feels more like a mundane habit rather than a huge emotionally distressing experience. \nI come from a traditional, non-western family, where mental health is treated like a taboo, so I was never formally diagnosed with depression or spoke to my parents about it. When my friends asked about my wrist, I avoided the topic because it made me feel ashamed and stupid. \nTo be completely honest, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a case of depression, or if it\u2019s just shitty teenage hormones at play (as my mom would put it). \n\nI\u2019m a few months clean, but recently, I\u2019ve been feeling the compulsion to do it again. I don\u2019t know why exactly. I just need to feel something authentic, and physical pain is something unabstract that I can understand. \n\nSorry if this is a huge incoherent ramble, I just don\u2019t get myself. I don\u2019t get why I self-harm, and I don\u2019t get why I can\u2019t value myself enough to get help. \nEverytime I try to talk to someone about it, I just feel like I\u2019m being dumb and dramatic. I know cutting isn\u2019t a healthy habit to keep to myself, I just don\u2019t know why I feel like I don\u2019t matter enough for people to take me seriously.  \n\nIf you read this whole wall of text, I really appreciate it. Your personal experiences and insight would mean a bunch to me! :)", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Stalk me if you're curious, but I'm not much worse than the rest of you guys. Started self harming before I was even in my teens, I wanna say 11 but my memory is bad. I remember my first cut though, it was made with broken watch glass on the upper side of my wrist (Still not sure why I did it there and not the inside of my wrist). I got pretty bad in my teens, 15 or so I was at my worst, like hitting fat with every cut and never caring for them at all, lived 50+ km from a hospital so no stitches. Though aside from those days I always tried to hold back to stop scarring, so I'm not too disfigured.\n\nAnyway I'm rambling. I quit once I left home at 16, and aside from the odd slip up I was clean, maybe with the odd couple weeks of intensive sh. My pain tolerance came way down. \n\nLately I've been struggling with what I think is autistic burnout, and I'm much lower functioning than usual. I was \"almost high functioning\" at my best, now I can't do anything or leave the house alone without a meltdown. And my girlfriend has depression which is also at a low point, so she often can't help and just tells me to go away. So I studied the blade. (Big sarcasm jokey joke I couldn't resist) but yeah I've started cutting again. I thought I wouldn't be back here again.\n\nIt's the height of summer and my forearm is shredded, but because my pain tolerance is back to normal, I only have these lousy ass pussy cuts to show for it. I miss getting faint from the blood loss and my hearing going funny. I miss when I felt valid-like I had a good reason for being depressed. Now I've got it made, dream house in a nice area, friends who care, thousands of km from my various abusers, but I'm miserable. And I can't even ducking work because I'm too bloody messed up. I feel worthless, but I couldn't die because of how bad it'd hurt my girlfriend. She'd kill herself too most likely, and I couldn't do that to her .

My immediate family see the marks but don't really say anything. I think that's cos I don't really matter. Nobody else knows I don't think. Most people think this is for young people. I'm not young. I just can't communicate how intensely bad i feel so scratching helps me get that out. ", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I don't expect anyone to see this, care, nor sympathize because I know other have it worse off, but writing at least fills some time that I wish I didnt have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been chronically suicidal for 2 years. I'm a 20 year old female. Last christmas I attempted suicide and did so again in the summer. I've been cutting since Dec of 2017. I can stop for a few weeks but always go back. People paint it as some gruesome thing but my scars are induced by a simple metal comb, eyebrow straight razor or a sharp cut key. I dont go too deep and the sensation is mostly seeing myself bleed. Sadness and emotional pain is so much more difficult to deal with than anger and physical pain are. I wish people who judged people who cut would take one look at this subreddit. See that these people aren't sadistic, they have stories, they have pain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was 17 I was sexually assaulted. I was tutoring a boy who was younger than me but taller and much bigger. I moved on and gave up tutoring and got a part time job while I wrapped up my last year of high school. I worked the night shift, 11-7am and was harassed by a customer who would try to sneak in to the back room where I worked. He would threaten me when he came through the drive thru and I did my best to hide. I had to leave that job as well. I decided to put off going to University for a year and got a full time job which started in September. I've never had a boyfriend, nor any friends for that matter. I always kept to myself and just did what I needed to get to University. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen i started this job everything was fine. It wasnt glamorous but it wasnt in customer service anymore and it was as secluded as an entry level job could be. Then my manager started to get friendlier and friendlier with me. I liked him, he was so much older but we were just having fun. I had never flirted or been interested in a guy before. They had let me down so many times and I honestly started to hate them all. It was super casual until he drove me to my apartment one night after a late working day. After that we were very close. We'de spend most of the working day together, open up to eachother, and I finally thought I had a friend in someone. When it got closer to the winter I started having anxiety about submitting my applications for University. I was still upset about things that happened to me in the past and was questioning my boss's intentions. I really liked him, he had a girlfriend, and I knew deep down he was a womanizer who just wanted attention. But I played into it. I always have played into what a man wants me to do. I hated myself. I hated that I had developed feelings for someone whose heart I suspected wasnt in the right place. But for a  brief moment my boss made me feel like I was special in some way. He was charming and I was vulnerable as fuck. He noticed one day that I had marks on my arms, even though I did my best to hide them. He hugged me for a long time. He just held me and I began to cry. I told him everything about myself. I told him that I was sexually assaulted and how much it affected me. He told me he had a friend who committed suicide and he wanted to help me through this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe listened, he seemed to give a shit. When i left that job in August to leave for school I was in a really dark place. I attempted suicide again and then was just angry at myself for failing twice at it. So I decided to change my mindset. Focus on the big picture and forget the past. I would suffer through school, go to work on the breaks like I was promised and if I cut so be it. It was a crutch that at least brought some relief. I wanted to be a lawyer. University to me right now feels so useless. My degree doesn't matter, the classes are useless, everyone in this place simply cares about having sex, partying and getting loaded. That isn't me. I have no friends here and everyday I want to die.  I planned to attempt suicide once again in the winter, on the date of my birthday. The thought of making it to 20 years old made me sick. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen the winter break this past December came up I desperately needed money and when I went back to my job which was secured for me to come back on the winter and summer breaks I was declined. They told me they didnt need anyone and \"they'll see how the summer goes\". Yet I found out later that right after that they let someone else who was a student come back. Then a co-worker told me that my boss had been telling people I sexually assaulted him. This broke me. This right now, is killing me. You can't trust anyone in life. He told people my story. Claimed it happened to him. Claimed I grabbed him by the dick and initiated sex. Thats what happened to me and he knows that. I was grabbed and forced into sex acts. The betrayal and pain from that is unbearable. \n\nMy birthday came and went, I took prescription sleeping pills and slept the whole day because I was too weak to try to commit suicide again.\n\nNow i'm just so lost. I have no money to pay the school, no money to pay residence, no support system, and am too cowardly to off myself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

It's a SH website and my post is explicitly about SH and wasn't graphic; why the fuck is it being taken down?)

Currently I\u2019m with my third therapist and I\u2019m considering telling her the truth about my self harming (I lied when she asked because my mom was seated right next to me when this happened. Bad move.) My best friends and my boyfriend are the only people aware of what I\u2019ve done, that is till today. \n\nLet me introduce you to my favorite teacher. I\u2019ve had him for two, going on three years now. We typically joke around with each other and have cool conversations which always calms me down. A few people including myself and my best friend, eat lunch in his room because screw cafeterias. Today my best friend (I\u2019ll shorten to \u2018T\u2019) and I went in as normal. Had our normal laughs and chats, it was fine till T got up to grab something from the fridge in the classroom. \n\nMind you, where I live is incredibly hot so I had my jacket off. I also forgot that there were cuts from a few days ago on my arm because I\u2019m that forgetful. When I picked up and drank from my water bottle my teacher walked right by me. He must have looked at me or my water bottle, or something. I don\u2019t know if it was my forearm that he noticed or my behavior as of late or what. \n\nHe abruptly stopped and asked, \u201cIs everything alright?\u201d And not thinking I instinctively said yeah in a cheery tone. His tone was dead serious, but it wasn\u2019t the same as when he\u2019d get pissed at us students. He kept repeating the question and saying that my answer wasn\u2019t reassuring at all. T walked back and he immediately changed the subject, to something about me and I could still hear that same tone he had when he asked. \n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do now. Whether or not it\u2019s right to ask why he asked me in the first place, or to just leave it. He\u2019s the type to tell me before he notifies anyone of higher positions about my thing, which is required by law in my state. I feel so incredibly guilty for shutting him out so quickly. He must\u2019ve been genuinely concerned and I pushed him away. What do I do now?\n", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

And Carlo, with his torturous split personalities and insomnia. I just want him to be healthy, he\u2019s so caring. \n\nOn that queer note, I came out to my family and friends recently about how I\u2019m really a guy. My brother and dad are great, my friends almost never slip up, and my mom is still a bitch. She fucking gets it wrong on purpose. Anywho. \n\nOn a slightly happier note, I started running again. I went 4 miles, but not very fast. I felt great. \n\nA question I like to ask friends is \u201cIf someone gave you a pill right now, and all you had to do was take it and you would go painlessly and instantly, would you take it?\u201d They all say \u201cNo!?!\u201d.  I would take it in a heartbeat. I\u2019m done. Just done. \n\nAnother thing about me, I crave intense and unhealthy friendships. It all started 2 year later ago. When she and I became friends. Pia. Suddenly, we were inseparable. We went from mere classmates to so close that we literally kept each other alive. I\u2019ll never forget those 30 minutes in my backyard, tears streaming down my face because I was about to lose my other half. I talked her down then, and her to me. Then I left. I couldn\u2019t bear it anymore, so I walked away. I left her. She ended up fine, but I never did. Now, whenever I make a friend, it gets really intense really fast, and then I lose it all. I\u2019ve been abandoned and heartbroken too many times to count. I don\u2019t even remember how I did it to her, so I just flail around hoping something will work. I\u2019m so broken that it\u2019s no longer \u201creal friendship\u201d unless we\u2019re so close it\u2019s suffocating, carrying so much we\u2019re in physical pain. I can never have a healthy relationship ever again. I am toxic. Toxic toxic toxic toxic. \n\nNow you know me. Mostly. It\u2019s motherfucking awful, and I despise what my life has become. Leave a comment. Or don\u2019t. Whatever. (Especially about the first issue. I could us assistance. )\n\nTl;dr: lazy cunt. Go read it. \n\nThe End", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I realized that I did not want to live my life like this...shortly after I made that post I made myself a doctors appointment to get a stronger antidepressant, I am happy to say that a month later i am 2 weeks clean and my deepest cut is almost healed. \n\nI am posting this for those of you who are struggling. For those of you who do not want to go to the doctor For those of you who are embarrassed to reach out and get help... Making that doctor's appointment SAVED MY LIFE.... the self-harm lifestyle does not have to be the life that you are forced to live. Even the deepest hole of depression can be climbed out of it just takes a small bit of work. No matter how many things go good in your life if you can still feel lost. There is absolutely nothing wrong with getting on an antidepressant and I strongly recommend doing so. I feel as if a weight has been lifted off my shoulders and a cloud of fog has cleared from my brain I can see the world so much more clearly and I am so much more happy now. I wish all of you the best of luck out there and if anybody...

I personally just wrote things like 'Mom' or names of loved ones on myself because I knew it was more personal.\n\n\\-Tape:\n\nI actually started this on my own, I had a diary that I wrote my poems in, my feelings and thoughts. Well one day I decided to take a thick piece of packing tape and taped the razor to the page. I wrote a bunch of really nice things on the page, things that would discourage me from hurting myself. So not only did it inhibit me from getting to the razor it made me look at all the reasons I shouldnt hurt myself.\n\n\\-Short Nails:\n\nAssuming you have already tried other techniques and are going through withdrawal, or your just a scratcher, then keeping your nails short help you not scratch hard enough to break through skin. I personally love long stiletto nails (ironically) so I dont do this, but I have enough control now to not scratch myself.\n\n\\-Ice block\n\nSimple enough, fill a tub half way with water and freeze it, place the item youre hurting yourself with in the center and pour more water on it (if it floats put something heavy on it to keep it down) then freeze it again, now it is stuck in a block of solid ice and the only way to get out would be to painstakingly chip at it or wait an hour or so to melt it down. Hopefully that gives you enough time to distract yourself with something else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\nThese are all of the ones I can think of at the moment, there are others like the rubber band and whatnot but I might cover those in another posts, but for now I hope these helped some people. &lt;3 xoxo", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Someone reported me for self-harm at my school.", "author": "Bookie_Curls", "self_text": "I don't know who it was, a friend or teacher but it came out of no where. I just started cutting again about two weeks before Christmas, the last time I did I was in 6th grade so about 5 years ago. No one knew about it back then and still don't except a single girl I met at camp that summer and haven't seen since. \n\nWhat I'm getting at is that this wasn't someone breaking my trust or something. They just figured it out somehow. I still wear short sleeves and while it's winter I'm not wearing shorts, but I still wear ripped jeans that show my thighs (at least enough to avoid suspicion but not show anything overt) , and I even just recently wore a skirt! \n\nThis may seem to be inconsequential details but I just don't know how they would know, unless someone was literally studying my thighs through my stockings the other day if my skirt rode up a bit or something, which is extra concerning for obvious reasons. \n\nI don't think I've been acting differently. I'm still just as obviously depressed, sleep deprived, wracked with increasingly dehabilitating anxiety and overwhelmed with stress as I have been since the first week of school. I know that sounds like the perfect storm for the stereotypical \"cutter\" but if any of my friends or teachers thought that, why now?\n\nI won't say that these things haven't been getting worse because they have. I feel like my life is spiraling out of my control (again, stereotypical, but there is a reason those exist, to an extent) and getting worse every day. But I've mastered being able to wear a mask. Or rather I just have a mask for a face. \n\nI'm not known for being the most expressive person. I'm told that I always look bored, even when I feel like I'm beaming or about to have a nervous breakdown. My own family isn't even able to recognize what exactly my face is telling them. So how could my friends or my teachers who I only met this school year be able to decode what I'm thinking. \n\nI'm honestly just baffled and this all may sound super na\u00efve and what not, but I'm just a 15 year-old girl with midterms next week and pressure building in me like an asthmatic trying to hyperventilate into a balloon. In short, I'm terrified and can't tell anyone because I'll just be chucked into a loony bin for the probably third time in five years. \n\nAlso, I obviously didn't tell the nurse/counselor shit because fuck off, your patronizing tone of \"oh I'm here to listen\" bull shit is just teacher speak for \"after I'm done interrogating you, I'm calling your parents and breaking that promise I just made just so your parents don't sue us if you become the third suicide victim we've had in the past four years\". If I sound like an overly cynical \"angsty edgelord\" teen it's because that's what I am. \n\nI just want help or reassurance. I'm just lost and don't know how things like this work. Are they going to call home just because someone was suspicious of me self harming? My mom already has enough stress and this would only exacerbate her problems and in turn mine making things infinitely more miserable for everyone involved. Except the counselor as she can sit back in her literally shower curtained off \"therapist office\" with the false sense of pride for \"helping the poor insane teenager who was too stupid to realise that mutilating herself isn't good for her health.\"\n\nThis has turned into an overly long rant that won't be read by anyone but it helps a little to get it off my chest. Not much though. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I want to figure out who reported me and find out why. I don't want it to happen again. I honestly think I went into shock when I first heard her say it. Thanks for suffering through this shit. I really appreciate any time just spent actually listening not just saying you are listening.

(please don't take that as i'm looking for sympathy i can't even understand why people get sad when someone dies)\n\nthen theirs my mother i guess i don't agree with her choices but i honestly don't care about them maybe i'm heartless but she's had her own problems and i guess it was her way of dealing with it, she's lied about money constantly through her life to the point where she nearly got the home repossessed, she's spiraled in and out of a drinking problem and lied about other things too but i feel the house is the most important to mention, she's emotional crying, laughing, shouting ect. and i dont get why i'm sorry if it feels like i don't care about anything i really try to but, how can i put this it's like i know how i should feel i know what i should do but i  can't do it each time i try it just doesn't happen.\n\nthen theirs me i don't value my life it's not important to me and i don't feel it's important to anyone else it probably is but i personally don't care about it I've honestly tried to kill myself more times because of just being bored but i guess i just have a little luck to say a few times i have tried standing in front of a truck that managed to miss me by literally about an inch, then theirs the time i tried to lay in the road and the first car that went by was an ambulance, then theirs the time i tried to overdose and i nearly did die but that attempt failed because they got me to hospital in time the list does go on but i think anyone reading this gets the point i have some sort of curse or maybe i'm just lucky i'm not sure what it is. i sleep outside some nights on the street just because i find it more comfortable yes i have been robed but it doesn't bother me. if you read this thank you it's only part of my life but i want to share it and try to find out why i dont care even about my own life and how people can be so emotionally invested in things and if your like this too please say so because i honestly feel like it's not important anymore like i should just stop trying to understand people \n\nsorry for any spelling errors ", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

The thing about healing from self harm and getting control on your thoughts is that you have to WANT it. Sure, you need to get better, but do you WANT it? It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t, to be honest I\u2019m not sure I want it either, but I do want to make my family happy and bring them together instead of rip them apart with their guilt of MY problems. I always here people say that self harmers cut for attention, but the only attention we get from it is negative. So, if we\u2019re feeling negative and then we do something to get a response and the response is also negative, it doesn\u2019t cancel out. This isn\u2019t math. When you add something bad to something bad, it just gets worse! Anyways, back to what I was saying. You have to want it, because if you don\u2019t you won\u2019t fully commit and, sure you might feel a bit bad if you relapse, but you\u2019ll have expected it. You\u2019ll have expected it because you told yourself that you weren\u2019t strong enough, because you told yourself you were going to cut. What would happen if those thoughts weren\u2019t there? If you somehow convinced yourself that you could get through this and that you won\u2019t cut again. I think if people can convince themselves of the positive possibilities instead of the negative we might have a more successful chance at healing. And trust me, I am NOT shaming anyone for relapsing or being negative or any of that shit cause I\u2019ve relapsed many times and I\u2019m negative all the time. I\u2019m just saying, that maybe, when you\u2019re ready to let yourself make the first step on that long scary journey of recovery, you need to want it and you need to believe you can do it. I\u2019m sorry for going on a rant I just saw this and it made me sad cause I want everyone to be happy and safe.

I've also been told I'm bad at telling stories, so we'll see how this turns out. I'll be leaving out a few details that aren't super important to the story, so if anything seems like it's missing that's why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe'll start in November, the week before Thanksgiving break. I've almost always kept to myself because I have trouble approaching people and making friends, but I did know 1 person who's fairly important to this story. We'll call her L, L was genuinely pretty cheery person and pretty fun to be around, and we would talk for about 20 minutes after school while we waited for our bus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a while, L introduced me to a little friend group she had, all the people in this group were great, but one stood out the most, we'll call her K. Once I was introduced to this group K and I hit it off immediately, we would usually pull away from the group and talk just to each other, mostly about random stuff, but whatever it was there wasn't any effort and everything just came naturally with her. After a few days of talking K finds my Instagram, and she shoots me a message, a message I will never forget because it started the shittiest rollercoaster of emotions and feelings I've ever been on. It read \"Hey Ethan, it's K, I'm not usually for good at conversations but we seem to click pretty well at school, so if you're up for an awkward text conversation here you go.\" I responded and we hit it off still, eventually things came to movies and given how well we hit it off, I invited her to go a see a movie the coming Monday, on the week of Thanksgiving, she agreed and we started looking at movies. Eventually we decided to see \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" because she was a huge Queen fan and I like their music and had heard good things about the movie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday comes and I walk to the movie theater, it's about 20 minutes away from my apartment so it wasn't much of an issue. K texts me and tells me she's running late because her mom is horrible with timing, it's all fine and good, it isn't her fault. After I wait and wait and wait she gets there, we head in and go to watch our movie. Nothing special happens, we talk a bit before the movie but it was good, and I enjoyed seeing it with her, her mom was there to pick her up and she gets in the car, I start to walk off to get home when her mom offers to take me home. Not wanting to look ungrateful I agree. I get home and everything is fine, we text as usual, and from here on out we would text every single day for nearly a month. This same night we made more plans, I would go over to her place the day before Thanksgiving and we would chill and watch some movies for a while.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe day before Thanksgiving comes, and I walk over to K's apartment, it's a 30 minute walk and it was pretty nice out so I wasn't complaining, once I get there I come up and we go into her room and put on a movie and just start talking, as normally and effortlessly you would think we'd have known eachother for years. After the first movie is over we put on another, and lay down next to eachother in her bed, and within about 10 minutes of that we're cuddling. Let me tell you now, at that moment that was the happiest I had ever been, everything was just perfect, nothing else mattered except this girl and what we were doing in that moment, we laid there and laid there until she had to get up to go to the restroom, and when she came back her mother was telling us we had to leave since they had Thanksgiving stuff the next day. I get a ride home and before I'm halfway up the stairs to my apartment I have a text from K, talking about how amazing it all was. I couldn't have agreed more, that same night we made more plans to hang out the next Friday after school, I would take her bus with her and we would hang out again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to that Friday, I take K's bus back to her apartment, and we put on a movie, we're sitting on her bed, I have my arm around her and her head is on my shoulder, and we're happy, she moves away for a second, and kisses my cheek. For me, the 15 year old who thought that no one in their right mind would want to show any affection to him, I was ecstatic, and I asked her out, because we obviously both felt strongly about eachother, she accepted, and we went back to sitting with eachother, just enjoying ourselves. Before long we're back to cuddling while we watch our movie, and at some point during this, she goes in to kiss my cheek and I went to do the same, resulting in what was pretty much a peck on the lips. Not even 30 seconds later there's more kissing, and I'm still the 15 year old who truly believed that no one could want to do anything like this with him, and it was a light in the dark. After a while her mother has to take me home again, as they were doing things the next day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe're going to skip a few weeks to Christmas Night. We hadn't hung out at all in between Christmas Night and the Friday after Thanksgiving week, just because we were always busy during the weekends, so the opportunity never presented itself. Knowing that it would stay that way over the Christmas break I had given her a hoodie of mine to hold on to. Now on Christmas Night, while we were texting things got extremely intimate, and there a few reasons why.\n\n1) K is a rather sexual person, both because we are teenagers and because of some things that had happened to her while she was young, I won't go into it because it isn't my story to tell.\n\n2) We had both been \"hinting\" at feeling that sort of way for a while, and Reason 3) brought it out.\n\n3) Before I say it, I would like to preface this reason with one of the main reasons I started cutting. K was drunk, she was just wanting to have fun on her own and her way of doing that was with alcohol, I hated that decision, and tried to at least tell her to take it slowly, but she is extremely stubborn and was having none of my advice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings were intimate, no pictures were exchanged, but a lot of things were said. It had never crossed my mind to not go along with it because she was drunk, and I fucking hate myself for that decision, because when we talked the next morning she had told me that she regretted almost all of what she remembered.\n\nAfter Christmas Night she started growing distant, we didn't talk as much and it was obvious something was wrong. I tried to get it out of her, so I could help, but she wouldn't tell me. This was when I made my first cut. I knew why she was upset, I thought I had violated her by letting her say the things she said, and I felt like a monster. I grabbed my pocket knife and I made a cut just below my elbow on my left arm, I had never been privy to hurting myself before, but I was so angry with myself, I felt like I should be punished, and so I did it. about an inch and a half long and not very deep, but it made me feel a little better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe'll skip over the next week, nothing important really happened, she grew even more distant and I began to felt even worse. We'll skip to January 8th. We started talking, and here's a half decent paraphrasing of the main idea.\n\nK: I have a fucked up mind  \nMe: No you don't, you're an amazing person, why do you think that?\n\nK: Because I'll always be really happy in a relationship, and then after a while I'll just start to hate it, and then I break up with the person even though they did nothing wrong.\n\nMe: What are you saying? Is that it? Are we?\n\nK: I think so, I'm sorry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have never felt worse, than when I realized what she was getting at. I spent the next 3 or so hours crying my heart out. I loved her so much and she didn't feel the same way anymore. I'm amazed I made it to the next day. After that night, every single day I got home from school I would make another cut, underneath my elbow, in roughly the same spot, every time going slightly deeper, and it feels like the only release. I could count the amount of times I've talked to other people at school of my own volition on 2 hands. I felt so alone and worthless, and cutting was the only escape I had. The only other idea I had to get away was to try and tell the story, which is the main purpose of this post. I never thought I would start cutting, I always thought I was better than that, but the sting of the knife, and seeing the blood come out of my arm, it's a temporary release, almost like a high. It's the only escape I really have, even if it isn't healthy, I don't know what else to do. I just miss her so much, from the second I woke up to the second I fell asleep she was the only thing on my mind. Now the physical pain I get from a knife is the only freedom I have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI realize this looks more like an r/relationships post than one that belongs here, if it doesn't focus enough on the cutting tell me and I'll remove it.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Cops, paramedics, hospitals, etc. Now in my notes that follow me around, my sh is noted as severe. So if anyone gets wind of any potential sh, I get jumped.\n\nWell I got back from treatment in 2018. Yeah, I got locked UP man.\n\nI have been on very very good behavior. Mainly, sh'ing in different ways that are less messy, and being very careful to not leave evidence if I did cut (i.e., flushing bloody toilet paper down the toilet instead of using nicer material to blot blood and having to throw away or wash physical evidence).\n\nWell, I got sloppy. I hit an artery. Toilet paper was uhm, no shield whatsoever against the flood. Nbd, tho. I got this. I grabbed a towel and calmly waited for the blood to coagulate and voila, magical blood clot, bandage wound, all is good.\n\nTOWEL WAS FOUND. Literally hours later. Such bad luck.\n\nMom called therapist.\n\nSo I met with her yesterday. Convinced her I was okay, cutting was under control, nbd, etc. Emphasized I had an important meeting right after the appointment. She reluctantly let me go if I signed a no harm contract and agreed to another appointment today.\n\nSo I debated not showing up. I realized it was a trap. If I didnt show, I was guaranteed hospital. If I did go and talked, I was guaranteed hospital. I figured I had a better chance of avoiding drama if I showed up and tried to talk my way out again.\n\nSo I basically talked in circles for an hour. She came to the decision that she would let me leave without hospitalization if I agreed to arm checks and family sessions. We would discuss final treatment plan monday.\n\nYo, I'm screwed. The moment she sees my cuts, I'm heading straight to the hospital. If I don't agree to arm checks, I'm heading straight to the hospital. \n\nHow the fuck do I get the fuck out of going to the fucking hospital?\n\nI'm fucking fucked.\n\nThx guys &lt;3", "subreddit": "MadeOfStyrofoam"}

I had been jumping from home to home (from my adoptive parents to my biological mom and to my maternal grandmother) and it was really hard on me. I felt super unwanted and due to prior abuse I was feeling extremely worthless. \nI had a desktop computer at my adoptive parents house. We were in the family room (second living room). They were sitting right behind me with their backs turned. I was searching up methods of self harm and what to use. I found some information on yahoo answers, but looked in my drawer on my desk and pulled out a pencil sharpener shaped like a puppy that I probably got from my school book fair years prior.\nAnyways I was extremely nervous. I went to my back yard with my dog and that\u2019s when I did it. I don\u2019t remember where on my arm but I know it was my left arm. I sat there for a while and then I went inside up to my bathroom and that\u2019s all I really remember. From there I\u2019ve been cutting. The longest break I\u2019ve taken was 3 months because my ex was pushing me to. \nCurrently I\u2019m not doing very good and I\u2019ve been cutting (and burning) almost every day. \nI want to recover and I want to get better but I always end up lying my way out of therapy and I don\u2019t know why. It\u2019s almost like I want to recover but I\u2019m almost scared to. \nI\u2019m 16 now and i wish I could go back to 2017. I was with my ex and we were happy. He made me happy.

I'm terrified of pain if it's not self-inflicted.\nSo my question is that has anyone gone to the doctor and did they put numbing stuff on it or are they just assholes and don't give u any since you're a cutter?

Thanks u/voidnasp and u/[fragilebird\\_m](https://www.reddit.com/user/fragilebird_m) for your comments, it helped a lot.\n\nNow, most of my urges are gone. I still get them, but in the background, they're reduced to voices instead of urges. I'm selfharm free for three years now (not counting two minor events).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now my question. I've been wanting to get a tattoo for as long as I can remember. I think they look really cool and add something to a person when done right. I dont NEED to get a tattoo, but I just want one. But here is my fear. I think my scars look really good. I dont have many scars, and none on my wrist or anything(I always made sure to only cut the surface), and whenever a wound is fading i get kinda sad. My preferred spot for a tattoo is on my right arm, which coincidentally is the spot I would mostly cut myself. \n\nOne of the side effects (so not on of the main reasons) of my selfharm was that I became obsessed with my wounds and my blood, I just really liked the look of it. I know I still have that part in me, I dont mind it, I dont care about it, but I dont think it's wise to feed it. So here is my question. Do you think it's a bad idea for me to get a tattoo on my preferred cutting spot? I just don't know whether my intentions are pure, or should be. I'd like to hear your opinion so I can make a better decision.\n\nThanks for reading", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

It has been at least 8 years since my last episode and the struggle never goes away. \n\nI'm married now. I am married to a wonderful soul that knew what he was signing up for. He takes care of me through manic episodes, my extreme anxiety, my fear of driving, and social anxiety. He takes care of me when my bipolar swings to the dark depths of depression; understanding why I simply sleep for weeks on end only leaving my bed to go to go to work because I'm too much of a pussy to call out sick. He, despite my efforts to push him away, will hold me tight when I randomly wake up sobbing for no reason. \n\nMy emotions are getting out of hand. Sometimes all I can think about are downing all my sleeping pills and all my Xanax and never coming back. I know this is the wrong thing to do but my alternative to easing the pain isn't an option. My beloved sees my naked body every day. He knows I used to self harm as the deep scars are evident all over me. Sometimes lately I begin to understand why my father is an alcoholic. \n\nI want to hurt myself. But I don't want to see the hurt manifest on the faces and hearts of those that I love. \n\nAnd the justification? Just as pointless as my existence. My fucked up brain chemistry aside. I feel as if time is running out. I'm 31 years old working in a career that I actually have a degree in. This career will never pay me enough to move out of my mother's house. My husband has a construction-like job: when there's a project there is a paycheck and when there is no project there is no paycheck. He is trying to find another career. Will I be too old to properly raise a family when that time comes, when we finally get a place of our own? I feel like I will. \n\nI work the graveyard shift. I enjoy this shift because it fosters an environment that allows less triggers for my anxiety issues. But all my mother and step-father see is me sleeping. Always sleeping. They complain about how much I sleep. To be honest, I often sleep longer to avoid interaction (sometimes to pretend that I no longer belong to this world). \n\nMy mother is cheating on my step-father and I am my mother's confidant. I did not want this responsibility, I hate it. My step-father has been in my life since I was 2 years old. He's not perfect but does not deserve to be blindsided. During my wedding planning all my mom would talk about was about her and her issues. I had enough and told her that she needed to see a therapist because I can't do this anymore. I was trying to plan a wedding and all I heard about from her is how to destroy one. We hardly ever actually talked about my wedding because every time I tried to include her she just made it about herself and her problems. \n\nMy annual work review went great! I did not know that my managers thought so highly of me. Yet, they happened to speak about how my work ethic is so amazing that I can come in half dead from an illness, put on a mask, and continue to do my job without complaint. This further confirmed my fear that they expect me in when I am completely physically I'll so I'm assuming that mental illness will be along that same path. \n\nAlready in an extreme anxiety swing, had a full on panic attack at work last night. It's easy to hide the dry heaves, heart palpitations, shaking, and sobbing when no one is there to see it. I can't take a rescue Xanax while I'm at work. It will severely impair my ability to concentrate. I am a registered veterinary technician at a 24 hour emergency hospital. I have patients that need me awake.\n\nIt irks me when I have coworkers that take a \"mental health day\" or go on leave for mental health. I think it's because I feel I don't deserve such luxuries. I know I'm expected to go to work. Besides, no one wants to fill in for a graveyard shift and I don't want to abandon my coworkers on a 3 person team. \n\nI do get asked \"how are you doing?\" And this most recent question come from a coworker. I could tell in her voice she wasn't trying to make small talk. She knows I had to call 911 for my mom last week. So I said \"I'm good, mom is home from the hospital now\". I'm not good, I think she knows it. \n\nBack to last nights panic attack. I was so close to taking a scalpel to my wrists. Or the pocket knife I carry. But all I could see in my head was the disappointed faces of those that love me. I still want to. I want to make myself bleed so bad.\n\nMy doctor scoffed at me when I said I wanted to try Xanax. He also forgot that he diagnosed me as bipolar. I have been on and off antidepressants since I was 12 years old. He caved and gave me half a standard Rx. I've been rationing for when times get too dark. My supply is getting low and I can't afford nor I am not sure if I can trust seeing another doctor. My problems are petty and not worth the air I waste. \n\nPeople around me seem to be able to talk about their problems freely. I cannot. I cannot verbally express what is going through my head or how I feel. I was a teenager the last time I tried. They wanted to institutionalize me. Everytime I try to fix a problem I just get handed shovels to dig this pit deeper and deeper. Almost like I am in trouble for even trying to call out for help. \n\nSo I've stopped calling out for help. \n\nI need to cut again. It's been years but I need the release since words only make things worse.\n\nI'm sorry that this post is so long and all over the place. I just needed to break my silence and vent for once.

I first learned about what suicide ment when I was like nine.\n\nI don't know why I have been thinking about suicide for so long, maybe it was like, a past life.thing or something? I didnt really think about it again until my two best friends got me one of those Amazon Fire kindles or whatever, and that's when I started staying up really late watching Youtube and such. I could hear.my parents fight all the time, and I really couldnt understand that. One day I asked my mom why they didnt just get a divorce, and she said it was because he still thoguht he was Christian, even though he had me before him and my mom were married. \n\nThe only Christian belief he holds (from what I can tell) is that he HATES gay people and anyone from the LGBTQ+ community, of which I am part of, so that makes it worse.\n\nFlashback once more about why I hate my dad, he has always verbally abused me. He yells at me about not being good enough, useless, stupid, spazz. Sometimes he'll flick my forehead really hard. He still does this.\n\nFinally, I found his drug stash awhile ago. We have an extra freezer down in the basement, his territory. I was poking around and I when into a corner it started smelling REALLY bad. I have never smelled weed, so I didnt know what it was. I liked around a bit more, and found it. Some weed and a bit of crack. That night I cut myself for the first time. This was a bit after Thanksgiving, I think?

So far the wounds are pretty minor. They bleed a little, but they're shallow. I think I might have brushed the top of styro a couple times, but I haven't had any gaping or persistent bleeding. I mainly use pencil sharpener and disposable razor blades. I can't get  new ones often without drawing suspicion, so I tend to reuse them. I always try to wipe them off with isopropyl alcohol before and afterwards if I have it on hand. Sometimes, though, I'll get the urge to do it somewhere where I don't have any way to sterilize. Once I used a freshly-unscrewed sharpener blaze that had been in my pencil case for months. Luckily it was too dull to break skin. \n\nI also dab a little alcohol on the cut as well. I've read that this inhibits the healing process a little bit, but I can't think of anything else. \n\nI also don't use bandages. If the cut won't stop bleeding I might stick a band-aid over it for a day or two, but we don't really have a lot of them and my family is going to notice if their supply starts running out. I stashed five or six in my backpack just in case, but I'm hesitant to use them.\n\nI've read that this might have increase the chances of scarring and slow down healing, but I'm not too worried about that. Most of my cuts are in areas that don't get exposed a lot anyway. I'm mostly concerned about infection. Most of my cuts are covered by my clothes, and I already use the alcohol to eliminate any bacterial presence, but I'm still really worried that one of them will get infected. I really don't want to have to visit a doctor, because that will lead to my parents finding out. Is there any way for me to minimize the chances of infection without medical supplies?", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

{"post_id": "ai0r55", "created_utc": 1548009429, "title": "First time SH", "author": "neinmv", "self_text": "Hey, I'm new and I don't even know how I ended up in here but its really cool that there is a safe place like this  \nThe reason why I'm writing this is because I have the need to express my thoughts safely without judgment. I'm not even looking for an answer I just need to vent. At the same time, I feel very silly and weak for feeling like this because normally I'm a very reserved person.\n\nSince the first time I cut myself I have been reading articles, blogs, etc, and I realized that a lot of people that harm themselves are really young, teens. The first time I thought about harming myself was 3 to 4 weeks ago, maybe a month ago, and when I actually did it was a week ago, and I am 24. I felt very old and awkward when I realized this was a teen \"trauma\". But fuck that, we cant choose what we feel and when we feel it, I just find very sad that there are 1xx year olds feeling as shitty as I am feeling right now.\n\nWell, I'm about to tell the history of my life and try to explain how I ended up like this.\n\nI'm not depressed (I think?), I have what you can call a good and comfortable life. My family loves me and I have friends that care for me. Financially speaking, my parents allowed me to continue studying another degree so I don't need to work or worry about money, I just need to focus on my studies. I travel, I go to festivals.... what I said, a very good and comfortable life. However, I never felt truly happy, that I fitted in somewhere. I have always been an outsider, not because of the people around me treated me poorly, but because I don't know how to engage in the life that I live in...? \n\nI don't even know how to explain it... I'll try again.... its like I'm watching people live their lives through a window, and they are encouraging me to jump from my secluded place to the real world, but I just don't know how to. I want a normal life with ups and downs, happiness and sadness... but I just feel nothing, total apathy. I'm never happy nor sad. It has always been like that. \n\nAnother factor that keeps me feeling like an outsider is that I am asexual. So while I see people falling in love, enjoying their sexuality, I just can't. I don't feel that. I can't do that. And I never wanted to do that. To me, love only makes you weaker. (So yes to your question: I am a 24year-old virgin and I have never been kissed)\n\nNow, something has changed and its fucking with me. Half a year ago a saw a new bartender in a pub that I frequently go, and I became very.... intrigued... It was very rare and new to me. And very stressful too, I didn't know how to deal with that. A month ago I told myself that I need to seize life opportunities, that I need to allow myself to feel love like everyone else does. So I got the courage and went to talk to him. We talked and talked, we had a lot of things in common and he even asked me for a date. My fucking first date. I was very nervous but the date went great, at least for me. We went to grab some beers, then dinner, and then he invited me to his house to watch a movie. \n\nI'm not silly, I may be asexual but I know the meaning of Netflix and chill. I like him very much, yes, but I don't feel sexual attraction to him... not yet. I'm not opposed to doing anything sexual, but just not so soon. So while we watched the movie I felt that he was waiting for me to do something. To get close to him, to flirt... but I fucking couldn't. We went out for a second date and it was almost the same. He was very cute and I got the feeling that he liked me a lot\n\nFuck... was I wrong.\n\nNow, he doesn't give a shit about me. And it is okay. I get it. I get why.\n\nAnd just like that, I came back to that dark place in my mind. I was again looking through a window. Again, watching people living their lives that weren't meant for me to live. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I not heartbroken, I just hate to feel this apathy again. Like I'm feeling nothing at all. I have always blamed my asexuality for everything. I never accepted it. But it is only now that I'm truly hating it. \n\nSo, to cope with that, I started experimenting with self-harming. And fuck I'm hooked. This gives me everything that I needed. The rush of the moment when I see blood... is indescribable. I realized that I don't mind the pain, what I like is the blood and the look of my scars. I like to look at my arm and see the mess that I made.\n\nNow I'm happier. I feel better with myself. I always felt like I didn't have the right to feel so down because I didn't have a \"real\" problem. Now I have a reason. Now, if I feel bad I just look at my arm. Now, I have a problem and I can feel depressed because of it, which gives me sooo much mental peace.\n\nAnd that is all I got to tell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*PS: this is my first time posting something on Reddit, if I'm doing something wrong or if I'm breaking any rule just let me know and I will correct it.*", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

When she was 19 and we were engaged, she made a resolve to quit cold turkey. This was really successful for her and led to an entire year of sobriety. But life threw a curve ball and due to some extremely hard circumstances surrounding our life, she relapsed and has found it difficult to continue to stay away. \n\nOver the last few months she has expressed a want to change, I however do not know what I can do to help encourage her to do what is necessary.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nEdit: this is my throwaway account to remain anonymous as my main account has pictures of us.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I like to use humor as a way to cope, and I understand if you don\u2019t appreciate that. If you feel this may trigger you to harm yourself in anyway, run. Run far away from this post, maybe even this subReddit. The rest of you, enjoy.\n\nBefore cutting I have swallowed inedible liquids such as Pantene shampoo, which does not taste nearly as good as it smells, and nail polish remover, which tastes even worse then it smells believe it or not. And according to my past self, swallowing Bath and Body Works Hand Sanitizer is a good coping mechanism for having a bad day at school, while at school. I can never smell Japanese Cherry Blossom the same way ever again. Aside from that I have also slapped and hit myself with my hands and other objects, or hit myself against other objects, hit walls, etcetera, etcetera. I have also burnt my skin with fire, matches, hot metal, etcetera, etcetera. So I have an extensive history of being a jerk to myself in a variety of ways. But today I wanted to try something new but extensive, and as much as I would love to whip out my Bath and Body Works candle and get cooking, it\u2019s not the most quiet way to self harm in a house full of sleeping people. I looked around my room and found exactly what I was looking for, a pencil sharpener. No, I was not looking to vent my feelings into my diary with a newly sharpened pencil, instead I had other plans. I used my nails, a small key, and a cuticle clipper before I could screw open the grand prize: the metal edge. With sweaty hands I grazed it upon my skin. The dull dollar store edge would not do. I sharpened it against a metal surface and we were ready to rock and roll. Trial and error. I kept going to soft. Finally, on my upper left arm, I went all out and ripped right through my skin. Once then twice. \nWhew. \nWow. \nI hate to say it, but that felt good. I felt like I finally did something right. Not to mention, my whole day prior to this has been utter shit. And so now I lie, my secret and I, in my bed on Reddit. Do I plan to continue? Maybe. I know it\u2019s not good for me. But for some reason when I harm myself on the outside, I feel better on the inside. A sense of peace. Quiet would be a good way to describe it.

Around 17 yrs old it upgraded to using kitchen knives to make very small serrated cuts, again when I was sad. These were very rare and happened with months in between, sometimes even a full year. Around 18-19, it upgraded to the sharper exacto blades and box cutters when I got stressed from college or when I got frustrated. This happened maybe twice a month for the remainder of my college life.\n\nAfter one time of cutting really bad in the school\u2019s bathroom (during lecture, I had said I was simply going to the restroom. It had been almost 15 minutes), I stopped cold turkey for almost 9 months. I just didn\u2019t feel the need for so long. I never had any scars from previous ones (they usually healed within a few weeks , only leaving a bit of discoloration), and i just sorta ignored my problems till recently.\n\nOut of nowhere, my need to cut SKYROCKETED. I\u2019m not even in school anymore, but I collect knives and always have one on me, so even when i\u2019m happy and hanging out with friends, I just get a sudden urge to do it. I excuse myself to use a restroom (at their house, at a restaurant, in a mall, hell, even in an arcade in vegas) and do it. I\u2019m bleeding a lot more with these ones, and I feel the need to do more at a time. When before it was a maximum of 5 small cuts, now turns to 6-10 per bathroom session (and i\u2019ve learned there can be multiple sessions per day, even if i\u2019m busy laughing and hanging out) , them usually being around 2-3 inches long down the sides of my forearms or above my knee. They all need to bleed enough to drip now, when before the pain itself was enough. \n\nI usually don\u2019t have anything that sets this off though. No stress, no school, no arguments. Just a wash of numbness that makes me feel like I have to do it, so i do. Why?

My parents thought I stopped  in August and I hid new cuts from them when I went inpatient in October because a new psychiatrist overreacted because of some passive suicidal thoughts. Since I got out, I stopped telling my therapist about it since I am afraid that she will send me to a higher level of care because the whole reason I got sent to inpatient in October was because a new psychiatrist overreacted about something I said. So now I'm afraid to tell anyone about it. I don't feel as great as I did after cutting when I first started and now I am never satisfied, so I sit for hours trying to get myself to cut deeper. Then after I finally get myself to stop, my thoughts of not cutting deep enough bother me until I get the chance to cut again. I tried to get a lighter today to try to burn myself but in my state, you have to be at least 21 (I'll be 21 in five months) to be allowed to buy one. Its gotten so bad that I have a box of different types of sharp objects under my bed I bought in hopes of cutting deeper and maybe being satisfied so the thoughts will go away. \n\nWhat makes it worse is that I have been eating only a small meal a day for close to a year in order to lose weight (I have been restricting for years) and I make myself feel worse by looking at myself in the mirror and comparing myself to people who are thin. Sorry this is literally a pity party, I have no one else to really talk to so its been building up for months. If I tell someone then they will take away my supplies and probably send me to inpatient or residential and never trust me again and then I'd have to leave college again, but its probably has gotten out of hand and I feel guilty for technically lying to everybody. Sorry this is a lot, but I just needed to vent and I honestly don't know what to do, so any feedback would help. :)", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I mostly cut on my thighs more than anything, and from 11-15 I cut on and off. Around 13 I did it pretty often. And from 15 - 18 I had pretty much stopped completely. I would \u201cbreak\u201d my clean streak but honestly I never kept up with it because it wasn\u2019t something I was addicted to.\n\nI\u2019m about to turn 19 and the other day I was having a really shit day mentally (stuck inside all day, house was a wreck, and I had been late with my antidepressants for the past few days) and I was having massive suicidal thoughts. I knew I didn\u2019t want to kill myself, I mean I really wanna fuckin live. And instead just ended up scratching the hell out of my forearm. \n\nThe thing is, I\u2019m a decently heavy drinker, and have had my fair share of drug binges, so in terms of self harm, scratching my arm really doesn\u2019t concern me. Do I know it was dumb? Yeah. Will I do it again any time soon? Most definitely not. It\u2019s always been an impulsive thing for me. And considering the fact that I do/have done drugs, some cuts on my arm are the least of my worries!\n\nA few friends know I have hurt myself in the past, my older sister and younger brother included. I\u2019m not too worried about my brother or friends knowing, I think they know me well enough to get that it\u2019s not that big of a deal, and my older sister doesn\u2019t live with me and like I said, they\u2019re really not that bad. \n\nBut the other day I wrapped my arm in some gauze (really didn\u2019t wanna wear a sweater all day, but it\u2019s freezing so I could have. Dumbass mistake) and my mother noticed and when I told her I fell (I was at a party the other day and it\u2019s icy out, so if I admitted to the party it would have been more believable) and she asked if I was lying and hurt myself. I assured her that I didn\u2019t but that fucking look on her face man...\nWhen I was younger and my sister and mom found out (mom found out through sister, sister also had those habits) their worrying was the main thing that made me stop. It just felt so, I don\u2019t know, disgusting? That\u2019s a bad word for it. But I can\u2019t stand them knowing. Maybe it\u2019s because I see myself as very independent. I don\u2019t like having other people involved in my problems, especially ones I think I can fix on my own, and I know I can with this.\n\nDoes anyone else have this? I don\u2019t know, but when I originally self harmed, their constant asking about it made me feel worse than how I felt before I did it! Like I would go weeks without even wanting to, and then they would bring it up and I\u2019d feel nauseous and it would almost trigger me to want to self harm.\nDoes anyone have any advice to now avoid all of this fucking worrying (of course number one being, not to do it again. I already got that)? It almost makes me want to isolate myself. I don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t shake it.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

My parents found out and forced me into  therapy until I straight up refused to go, and said I was all better. I wasn't, but they heard what they wanted to hear. This went on up through the rest of middle and high school. Getting worse and worse, deeper and deeper. I was endlessly exhausted and felt as if my life was only going to go on for the next month. Feeling as if I had an anvil on each shoulder and a black hole in my chest. Until a day in 10th grade I had cut on my upper arm, and they saw. My mom sat down with me and talked to me calmly this time. I was at the point then that I was so run down I didn't want to feel like this any longer.. I told her everything I could manage. We started on the process of finding a therapist, it was one, two. I hated them, three, she is an angel! She was exactly what I needed, I found someone that knew how to get to me. I got onto meds, and I resented it at first, and hated the little pink pills. Over the rest of high school and the first half yr of college it was up and down, cut here, crying in the shower there.

I started thinking about cutting, and eventually I started doing it purely for attention. I soon realized that I actually didn't want anyone to find out so I began cutting my leg instead so nobody would see. It turned into a way for me to express (if that's the right word) my feelings, and tbh, I liked the way it felt after I did it, mostly the throbbing. The cuts weren't deep at all, they kinda looked like cat scratches-probably because I used a needle to do it. I only cut from around mid-October to early-November. The cuts have scarred, so now I'm absolutely horrified to wear shorts when the weather gets warmer. I don't want my parents to find out, and I don't trust any of my other friends enough to tell them either. My best friend-who we'll call K, has been here for me and she already knows all of my issues; except this one, and I've known her for a few years. I know she has a LOT of strong opinions about mental health and other things similar to that topic. I don't want her opinion of me to change, and I don't want to disappoint or worry her in any way. I'm not sure how she'll react. She just recently stopped talking to one of our friends bc of something she did, I don't want the same thing to happen to me. I just don't want to dump this on her either because it's her first year in university, so she's getting used to a whole new lifestyle and she has so much going on in her life. I still have thoughts about cutting, I always have ever since I first did it. It usually happens when I have a really bad breakdown, but I haven't brought myself to do it yet.\n\nIt's hard for me to make a decision because I know she'll be here for me 100% but I also don't want to worry her to death, you know?\n\nShould I just tell her what I did?", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

(I\u2019ll just state now that I work in retail for a well known supermarket chain.) My first thoughts were (as you could probably understand) nothing but hatred towards this woman, how dare she diagnose me when iv done nothing but work my arse off for her giving her nothing but 110% all of the time. When I had time to cool off and think about it I did go see a doctor and was put on a course of sertraline 50mg. And in all honesty, it helped... a lot. I was happier at work, in life, in day to day activities I felt normal. After 6 months my doctor began to reduce my dosage and I came off them completely after a total of 12 months. And everything was fine. Fast forward to present day (2 years after the story I just told.). I\u2019m working for the same company, but for a different boss. I absolutely love working for her, iv never felt as happy in my job as I do right now. And that\u2019s where it stops. Work is my happy place. I work 48 hours a week and I genuinely only feel happy at work. My home life is shit. I\u2019m 29 years old, single, and still living at home with parents, trapped in a cycle that I can\u2019t ever see ending. So back to the doctors I go. Start of December just gone (2018) I get prescribed a dose of sertraline (50mg) once again. A small part of me feels happy, safe in the knowledge that it fixed me last time, why shouldn\u2019t it again. No dice. Follow up appointment a month later (jan 1019) my dosage is increased to 100mg. Now we are at present day. 3 weeks into the new dosage and I can honestly say I have never felt more normal than I have done in a long while and that things are finally starting to look good. Until the other day. Massive argument with my parents who (because I still live at home) think I should be spending more time with them rather than treating it as a doss house/hotel. The argument went on for a good hour or so and all I felt at the end of it was.... nothing. I felt nothing. I know they love me unconditionally and they are aware of my current situation and they only have my best interests at heart. Even so, I felt nothing, and have shut myself off from them for the entirety of today. It was when the argument was finally over I noticed a Stanley knife on the side (the one I use for work.) like I said at the start of this post I am not suicidal and have never thought of self harming but something got to me today. I took the knife and went to town on my right forearm. I didn\u2019t want to kill my self. I just wanted to feel something. Which to be honest makes it all worse because I didn\u2019t feel anything. So I repeated the process on my left forearm.... still nothing.  Am I dead inside? When did I stop caring? I\u2019m actively pushing those closest to me away from me and for what? Iv never felt so lost in my life and I can\u2019t for the life of me understand why. I have good friends, I have a family that loves me. I have a job that I actually love yet I still can\u2019t get rid of this self loathing depression monster that\u2019s buried inside me. To top things off I now have to go to work tomorrow with what resembles a barcode etched into both my forearms and for what? Because I just wanted to feel something.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

My mother insisted on coming in with me at first which she usually doesn\u2019t do because I can\u2019t talk about my problems with her around, and when she came in she was sobbing, saying she can\u2019t cope, and suggested hospital admission because of my risky behaviour. I attempted suicide 4 times last year, three overdoses and one attempt using a bag and a helium tank. My sister is mentally and physically ill, not a month goes by where she isn\u2019t having organ failure. My mum is stressed and seeing her in tears like that made me cry for 40 minutes straight, and I haven\u2019t cried in months. I feel like a burden to her. Furthermore, my psychiatrist saw a lot of issues with my 600 calorie restriction and said my antidepressants wouldn\u2019t work on so little nutrients, so today I had to eat 1276 calories which has made me feel disgusting. I don\u2019t ever want to be seen by anyone again. And I\u2019m so exhausted and so tired of feeling like this that I\u2019m ready to end it all.\n\nRight now I have really strong urges to self harm. I used to do it frequently, stopped for about 6 months and a few days ago I relapsed. Each time I\u2019ve done it I\u2019ve tried to go deeper and deeper. I\u2019m trying to ignore the urges but because I hate speaking to people that I\u2019m close to, I\u2019m left to deal with it and usually end up giving in. Right now, I have a really strong urge to press down hard and swipe fast, when I usually only press down gently and cut slowly. I also feel as if I may cut my artery because of the exhaustion I feel, if not tonight then within the next week. I just want this to be over, I don\u2019t know how to avoid my urges today but I\u2019ll do almost anything to not self harm tonight and to stay around for my mother who\u2019s downstairs.

You try to kill yourself, but you can't even do that right.\n\nIdiot. Worthless. Stupid. Useless. Unlovable.\n         It's your post secondary years. Nothing's changed, really. You've started a degree that you don't want to do, but it makes your parents happy, and all you want in the world is for them to be proud of you, to consider you truly as their son. You take up some harder drugs to hide your darker side, you drink, alot. You make friends with people who you really shouldn't be friends with. They care about you but they care about the facade, you aren't you. You're too much of a coward to try killing yourself again so you start cutting.\n\nIdiot. Worthless. Stupid. Useless. Unlovable.\n        You're introduced to her. She's amazing, and the first person that knows the real you. You're falling hard, she's the first person you've trusted enough to open up to.

Those dark thoughts don't come nearly as often, the cutting has almost completely stopped. You met someone, you're cautious, but they've been through the same hurt. They've experienced the same pain, and you can feel a real connection.\n        You're wary of opening up to someone again, you'll probably get hurt again, but what's the point in going through life totally alone? What has it gotten you this far? A ruined arm? Constant nightmares and panic attacks? Why not take a chance?\n        So you wait for her. She's not ready, and needs time to open up to you.

Maybe, maybe not, but it's a chance at true happiness for the first time.\n        You laugh with her, have fun, learn and grow with her.

The problem is, that the bad things haven't stopped, and I haven't found a better coping method, but I can't for the life of me cut myself - I try, I make a small scratch and immediately give up and put my knife away. It's not because of the pain, in fact the pain is the #1 reason did it in the first place. It's also not because of the scars, as I know they'll soon heal, and on top of that, they didn't stop me before. I understand, that cutting is bad, but now I'm left with no coping method - I just sit around all day, staring at the wall, ceiling, a chair, whatever, occasionally trying to start doing something like playing the guitar or a video game, but I give up in 2-3 minutes and go back to feeling bad about myself.

I don't feel like it's bad or harmful or dangerous (even though I know full well it is but doesn't mean my mind will accept it) but I still know I should find a way to stop.\n\nThe reason I want to stop is that my best friend tells me he wants me to stop and it makes him stressed and worried about me. Although I don't want to stop, I care more about him and know it's for the better anyways.\n\nThe reason I'm asking is because I don't feel how most other people feel so general advice doesn't work. The main reason I cut, other than helping me feel better, is because for some reason I think it's very aesthetically pleasing. I love seeing the scars and it makes me incredibly happy to see all the old scars overlap and the pattern of it. I like the feeling of the knife across my skin, but I don't do it because I want to feel pain or bleed or to punish myself.\n\nAnother reason I enjoy it is the taking care of it. It's really satisfying to clean my skin and knife with hydrogen peroxide, wipe the blood off my knife, clean away all the blood from my skin, and bandage myself.\n\nI DO feel an addiction to it, which is something I dislike. It's hard to stop. It's hard to tell myself that no, one single cut isn't inconsequential. It's not harmless. Cutting is not a reward for resisting to do it for a period of time. I can't wean myself off, doing it just makes me want to even more. I know I've lost control but I can't make myself take it seriously.\n\nI don't do it when I feel especially bad or angry or get triggered by anything, so it's not like I need to calm myself down. I don't feel ashamed of it and love the results of it, so I can't pride myself or congratulate myself on not having scars. I don't hate myself or want to die or punish myself. I know logically it's not a good thing but I just don't feel it in my heart and don't have much internal conflict about doing it. My friend told me I should stop for my own sake, not his or anyone else's but my mind doesn't consider it bad or detrimental in the slightest.

I always have the capability of doing it, but i dont. Here is why:\n\n1.) make a promise:\n\nI promised a friend who i love dearly that i wouldnt hurt myself. Because she hurts to see me hurt, i dont want to hurt her. So i dont hurt myself. It can be anyone you love that you make this promise to, but be honest about it. Otherwise the promise is empty.\n\n\n2.) find better uses for your time:\n\nI love science, so i research and play around in Science-based video games to get my mind off of things. Now from what i gather, you enjoy art. So paint, or sculpt, or what ever you enjoy to do with your time. This develops a coping mechanism thats healthier than self harm, and lays a framework to build upon.\n\n3.) Understand that failure is okay, but also understand that honesty is important\n\nIT IS OKAY TO FAIL, IT IS NATURAL. But being honest to the person you made a promise to is important. so if you fail, tell them, explain to them how you feel and why you relapsed. This is to maintain a geniune promise and will keep you in check. \n\n4.) Convince yourself you want to stop\n\nYou need to tell yourself that stopping is important, whether you think its true or not. Self-harm is not the best option, nor a good one. So this part is completely in your hands. Nobody can convince you better than yourself, so this part is SUPER important.\n\n5.) Work on it, and practice healthy coping skills\n\nThis is where the skills you learned in step 2 come into play, instead of self-harm, do what YOU enjoy to do. \n\n\nI hope this helps\n\nThis comment didnt get very much attention, as i expected. But i think its important to share with you guys and gals that are suffering, feel free to ask or comment anything you want. \n\nGood luck on your roads to recovery, friends", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

There is this fat cut that's like an 1 1/2 inches long on my thigh that I made on the 21st. I made 4 other fat cuts on my thigh but those had pretty much 'closed up' by themselves on the first day (the sides had pressed together on their own and it started healing like that.) \n\nSo this one fat cut has been healing open. Now I will admit I probably haven't been doing the best with wound care. I change the bandages everyday, dont touch the wound with my fingers but that's about it. Each time I change the bandages I look for signs of infection, theres no swelling, heat, puss, foul smell ect. \n\nSo today when I changed my bandages that one fat cut had this green kinda crusty discharge on the bandage. I've seen this before. Ive had some deeper and longer fat cuts on my arm a few months back and one of them had that green stuff around it. I didn't worry too much about it because I was kinda taking my antibiotics and just thought it was something deep cuts did since they heal gross. \n\nBut now I'm kinda peeved bc 1.) I'm not taking antibiotics and my wound care is a bit less mantinace 2.) The edges of my bandages keep coming up and sometimes I dont realize it till the side is not sticking to me at all anymore. I'm kinda not worried bc this has happened before and the cut healed fine. But ofc the things on the internet say my cut is horribly infected and my leg is going to die and need to be amputated. I dont want 5o go to a doctor at all. I don't want anyone to know I'm cutting again, I just to keep this to myself. \n\nDeep cuts aren't even truly w o r t h it. For the past couple of days I've been doing alot of small cat scratches and omfg they are so much easier to deal with. The only con is that they sting like hell for some hours, but other than that they are a breeze. No fucking bandages, no excessive bleeding, no accidently hitting a nerve, no stitches, less money spent on medical supplies, lower risk of infection, etc etc etc. Right now I wish I could revert back to where I was only doing cat scratches and was scared of going deeper.

I can't handle much pain, it sometimes almost triggers me in a way (when I was a kid my friends would hurt me on purpose and then give me shit for not being able to handle it, and purposely hit my mouth when I got a frenectomy, etc), so why am I here harming myself? Plus the physical lingering pain in my arms and the looks my friends gave me upon seeing them and hearing my explanation did not feel very good at all.\n\nI've noticed all of the marks have gone away except for one big main one. For some people, I know a scar like this on their arm would be a power object of some sort. A constant reminder that things are better now, that they've overcome their difficulties. For me when I look at it, despite it being faint and can be easily passed off as a freckle, I know deep down inside that I did it to myself, and that I can't believe I let myself hit that level of emotional turmoil.\n\nHave your scars disappeared?

Here's the summary of my situation.\n\nI've been self harming since April of 2018, and 3 days after I did it for the first time I told my parents. It was probably one of the hardest things I've ever done. But I'm glad I did it. Their reactions hurt me so much. They were so sad and scared... They ended up finding me a therapist as soon as possible and I'm very grateful for that.\n\nHowever... They think I only cut that one time in April. I've been cutting at least once a week since then, without them knowing. I'm pretty damn sure my most recent cuts are infected. There's a fair amount of redness around the wound but that's my only symptom. \n\nSo here's the deal. I'm going to have to tell my mom about it tomorrow, because I probably have to get it checked out by a doctor. I'm hoping in the morning (Tuesday the 29th) it will be magically gone, but that's highly improbable.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the timeline.\n\nIt is in the evening here on Monday the 28th (Jan 2019).\n\nIn the morning, my mom will go to work until about noon. She's got the rest of the day off\n\nThen we will go to Barnes and Noble.\n\nThen after that she will take me to my therapy appointment.\n\n(Here's what I'm thinking of doing from here)\n\nI will talk to my therapist about telling my mom/dad/both, and hopefully she can encourage me.\n\nThen my mom and I will drive home (dad's at work) and I'll break the news to her that I've been cutting since April and I need to see a doctor for a possibly infected cut. \n\nI won't tell her before we drive home from the therapist because I'm not sure if she'll be able to drive after I tell her. I'm not sure... Another option is for me to tell her before she leaves for morning work tomorrow, but she'll have to call in sick because she won't want to leave me alone. \n\nThings I'm afraid of: \n-Telling my therapist about my worsening mental state and possibly being committed to a hospital.\n\n-Telling my mom and her possibly taking me to the hospital for reasons other than to get my cut cleaned of infection\n\n-The infection getting worse and it being too late to save me. (Highly doubtful)\n\nI cut on Wednesday (23rd I believe), and I'm pretty sure I began to see symptoms on Saturday/Sunday. I don't think I'll die, because the wound doesn't look that bad. It's scabbed over with a itty bitty bit of yellow crust on it, but hardly any. It's significantly more red than the rest of the minimal cuts I made. From what I've read online, the Normal redness should have gone away by now. It doesn't hurt very much and I don't have a fever. It doesn't stink either.\n\nIm just wondering what you guys would do in my shoes and any tips/thoughts (ANYTHING) you might have.\n\nThank you for reading this far!\n\n(I hope I didn't miss anything)", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

First time posting here, and it did take some courage, but... Figured might as well. Maybe you guys would understand.  \n\nI started cutting first when I was around 10 or so. Honestly amazed I never got any infections then, did it with rusty scissors, barely cleaned the wounds with water, and hid them in sweaty hoodies that I never washed (because I always had to cover myself from head to toe). \nBack then, I was bullied at school and home was problematic, to say the least. Had no other way to express my feelings, since I had no one to talk to. It brought moment of clarity to when the thoughts just went far too fast in my head, and I just wanted a moment of quiet. And it was a way to punish myself, since I hated (and still do) myself. \n\nI stopped cutting when I was around... 13-14. I had been to therapy, sought it myself, and things had been looking okay. Home was not as bad, my parents had gotten help for their issues. I finally had friends. I had hopes for the future. I ended therapy when I was 15, thinking I would never seek it again. \n\nOnly, things have taken a turn for the worse now. I'm 20 now, and in therapy once again, and recently, like the title says, I started cutting again. And I'm so ashamed of it. \n\n\nSo much has just happened. I'm in a relationship, and it's really emotionally tasking, since... My SO also has a lot of problems. And I try to take care of them, but it's... Just a lot. We have been talking about that, but I'm not sure if things are going to change soon. \nI don't hold it against her, she comes from a bad home situation, and has overall lot of mental health issues. And she does try a lot, and I'm proud of her for that. \nLot of my friends also have problems too, and I tried to help them, putting on a mask and saying that I'm fine. \nI think the worst was, that I did not get to any places to study after high school. I tried to get to places, but did not get accepted to any place in a few years that I tried get into. \nMy dreams have been almost completely crushed, and it still hurts. And it made me feel so useless and stupid.  I still live with my parents. I have done some odd jobs here and there, and trying to find something new to dream about. \n\nAnd with all that, I'm cutting. All the progress that I made when I stopped have been washed away, and I'm back to old habits. Just last Thursday I cut because of stress. I was just so, so tired... And I could not deal with being someones shoulder to cry on again. We were talking trough chat, so they could not see me cutting while they were venting to me. I did not know how to really help and the day had just been so exhausting already. \nI know that I*m not anyone's therapist, and I should not be. It's hard for me to simply place that boundary, since it's kinda what I tend to do. I want to help people. I know how being listened to is helpful. \nI think that people around me know that, they like to vent to me, but since I don't ask for it back, they themselves just...Forget about it. \n\n\nI'm just..Ashamed of cutting again. I thought I was done with it!\nThe biggest thing is, that there is yet another reason why I do it. Besides the ones I mentioned before: self punishment, wanting a moment of clarity, expressing emotions... There is a new one. And I kinda hate it. \nAnd it's attention. \nSee, before I hid my wounds. I hid them, never showed them to anyone, and hated them. \nWhen I started again, my therapist encouraged me to speak to ones I trust about problems that i have, instead of just keeping it all in. So, I told my best friend and SO that I started cutting again. From there, I have been learning to be a bit more open about it. It has been helpful, and I have a few times even called for help before I have cut. \nBut the thing is, I... Like, the attention, when I show my wounds to my SO or friend. \nBefore, I felt like my pains had no place. My SO had so many troubles with her own mental health, issues with her family. Her depression is so bad that I often need to kick her a bit to get her to take care of her apartment and needs, like taking a shower at least once a week. I felt like I had no place to vent about my troubles, even though she assured me I did. She always does, she want's me to talk more, but when I want to, it's like something always happens to her. That needs solving first, more than my little troubles. \nI felt like my friends did not give me enough attention. I always took care of them, made sure everyone was comfortable, swallowing my own anxiety in case it came around.\nNow, all I need to do is show my scars and I get attention. My SO takes care of my wounds, and we might talk why I did it, for a while we talk about what's wrong with my life. My friends look at me more, I can SHOW that I have pains. I can just show that I'm not feeling great, instead of trying to explain. \nWhich, they would not hear anyway. If we are in a group, the loud ones have a habit of speaking over everyone. And I rather not shout to say something. \nI have just been supportive all my life, so...Getting some attention like this feels just...Good. For once, I'm noticed and cared for. \n\nBut it still makes me feel so ashamed. The one thing that is often said about cutters is that we do it just for attention, and here I am. Doing it partly for attention. Just partly, but it's still a reason. \n\nI told my best friend about it today. As well as my therapist. \nThey were both understanding. But the feeling is still there, even though I am more relieved that I was not judged by them. \nI don't think I can tell anyone else, not even my SO. I don't know how she would be. I'm afraid she would be paranoid about venting about her own problems from then on. Or...Something along those lines. \nOr maybe I'm just worried that the sweet moments where she takes care of me are taken away, in case she is worried that those encourage me. I would not blame her. \n\nI do hope that in therapy, this all would get better. \n\n(And yes, I know this is all partly my fault. I should know to make my own needs more clear and be more open about needing more attention but damn it it's hard.) \n\nSo yeah. Thank you for anyone who read it. I would be interested in hearing any thoughts you might have. \n", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I do too much around the house that I need my sleeves rolled up for, and the sensory feeling of having sleeves in the way and risking being found out because my mom notices that (how I got caught a couple times before) isn't worth it to me. I tend to bruise my arms instead and cut elsewhere, because those go away and they're easier to explain than cuts. Lately the bruises have been getting bigger and worse, primarily because I started using things like small hammers to strike myself with instead of just my bare hands. Last night was bad. I already had bruises from a few days ago (don't remember exactly when), and I tend to go for the same locations unless i'm trying to avoid them. I wasn't sure before if I ever dissociate, but I think I did then because while I was doing it, the only thing I can remember clearly and felt present for was taking out and putting what I used away. The pain and my other senses felt dulled in a way I wasn't used to, and I knew that didn't feel right and my arms should be killing me (they usually are even when i'm incredibly emotional). It almost was like a partial blackout, where I remembered bits and pieces of the moment enough to piece it together in my mind, but there are holes where I don't know exactly what happened, and places that feel like there should be holes and Im unsure if there are because my sense of time was so screwed up. It was the whole night really, I know I'm usually bad about time but it was even worse, and I couldn't put anything besides major events in chronological order (dinner, brushing my teeth,etc.). This was difficult to explain, but hopefully I did a good enough job. (And I wasn't under the influence of anything by the way. If I were this wouldn't be so weird lol)\n\nAn hour or two later, I was putting lotion on my face and still upset about something my mom said to me. I suddenly decided to punch myself in the jaw, and afterward I looked in the mirror and felt a weird disconnection with my own face? Like I knew it was supposed to be mine, but I kept looking at it and trying to figure out how. What made it mine I guess was what I was looking for. That time I was present enough to feel pain, and based on that I thought I may have bruised my jaw. I still don't know if I did, going to check after, but if I did it's minor because the area isnt extremely tender. My arms, on the other hand... Never would I have guessed that they looked that bad, because I barely felt anything. Maybe some of the sensory stuff was from hitting multiple bruises, but those bruises I hit now look a reddish-brown and are larger and more painful bumps than before. (This is on the inside of my forearm) They are much more noticeable than the standard blue-green I leave behind, and i'm kicking myself because the whole point of refusing to cut there was to fly under the radar. I'm angry that I wasnt being careful and didn't go around the other bruises, because now I have to be more careful about rolling up my sleeves. Several minor ones are much easier to hide than a single major one. ", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I told her that I tried to SH in middle school as a cry for help, but stopped, and she reacted well, so I told her it continued into high school (in college now) but it was more of a punishment thing, still a good reaction; non-judgemental. Eventually I just spilled because I was dissociating and about to cry. I never understood the word \u201ccathartic\u201d before this moment.
