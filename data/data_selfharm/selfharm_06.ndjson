I don't really understand it either. Sometimes when I get really upset I'll hit myself (face and legs), bang my head against something, or grab at my face/push at my eyes. I probably started doing this around two years ago, I don't remember it happening any time before that. It doesn't happen often, but it's happened enough that it's a problem. I've bruised myself, very small, underneath my eye from grabbing at my face probably around three times. I think I do it because when I get upset I believe I deserve it.\n\nI guess I'm finally realizing that this *is* self harm and it's a bigger issue than I originally wanted to believe.

Just rambling, but I am actually desperate at this point\n\nI am so fucking done. I am crying hysterically right now. Had trouble sleeping and have had a headache all day. I haven\u2019t slept properly since I started trying to stop self harming, which was 17 days ago. I fell asleep around 3am, then woke up in a confused, panicky daze. I was shaking and sweating and felt horrible. Woke up my dad because I just wanted someone. He was worried because I was obviously not okay. I took two ginger tablets (helps with nausea) and we started talking. I told him that I am extremely paranoid at night, that I hallucinate. He knows that I suspect that I have depression so I told him how I feel that I have an empty, bottomless hole in me that I need to constantly \u201cfill\u201d, and that is the reason I am on the internet all the time. I even came clean about that I used to basically starve myself just so I would feel something. His response? \u201cThat is not smart.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t understand. He meant well, but he kept talking about how \u2018everything mental can be fixed\u2019 and \u2018it is not physical, so you can always get rid of it if you want it enough\u2019. Needless to say, that didn\u2019t feel good to hear. And since I have no fucking control over my stupid emotions, I tried to explain that it isn\u2019t that simple. He didn\u2019t like that. It got more and more heated. Eventually it morphed into him saying that I was being aggressive towards him, while I just sat there crying hopelessly.\n\nI am so confused. I love him, he is my dad, but he freaking sucks sometimes. I have always felt that he is manipulative (but maybe not on purpose?), but I cant even mention anything close to it (while furiously blaming myself), or he will make me feel like the bad guy who made him sad because I \u2018use everything he says against him\u2019. Tonight I said something like \u201cI have all these confusing emotions. People can easily toy with my emotions because I am over emotional and have no control over my feelings. I feel like that sometimes when we argue, and no matter what, I always end up feeling super guilty. It is totally my fault but I cant help it. It causes me a lot of stress. What should I do to fix it?\u201d AND THEN HE ACCUSED ME OF TRYING TO PERSONALLY ATTACK HIM. At this point I was crying so much I almost struggled to breath properly. I said that I didn\u2019t mean to do that, I just wanted advise on how to stop feeling so guilty. He told me to shut up.\n\nHe went to sleep again about an hour ago. I was so out of it. I have never cried like this before, ever. Not even during panic attacks. I wanted to kill myself so badly. I almost went to the kitchen for a knife, but instead went to the bathroom and my tweezers. I slaughtered my clean streak. Back to day 0, but I don\u2019t have the strength to try again. \n\nPlease don\u2019t say that my dad is abusive or anything. He is not. He has never made me hurt even close to as bad as this before. He is awesome really, I love him. And he willingly woke up in the middle of the night to help me calm down. I just don\u2019t know what to do. My mom is not home right now, she will be tomorrow. She wouldn\u2019t understand my problems. I don\u2019t want to drag my siblings into this mess. Am I in the wrong? What can I do?\n\nMy chair is still warm after he sat in it. It hurts so much\u2026  \nI just want to hug someone who cares about me, and who I can manage to trust.\n\nAfter all this, he is now outside my bedroom door, all sad, asking if I am okay and if he can help me. And i feel bad for him. I don\u2019t think I can fully trust him ever again.  I cant stand this anymore. It is like everything turns upside down every five minutes. I am done, I cant handle this.

Around lesson 6 Mr P decides to come to class and take me out for a chat, this is pretty common since the school had recently found out about my self-harm and suicidal tendencies so he would checkup often. Only problem with this is that this particular day was very low and I had so many urges so I was in a bit of a different mindset all day. He proceeds to ask me just general stuff and I reply normally, everything is ok until he started asking about coping and whether or not i\u2019m safe, not wanting to lie but not wanting to say the truth, I said \u201cyeah let\u2019s go with that\u201d impulsively which immediately started the fire of questions. Somehow in this time I had decided it would be an appropriate time (it really wasn\u2019t) to make some suicide jokes and hint that I might not be safe, idek why but it was just my humour and I usually joke like this with friends. I kept repeating that I would \u201cbe fine and i\u2019ll try not to die haha\u201d and that I would \u201csee him on Monday, maybe? haha\u201d. I then proceeded to laugh almost hysterically and tell him its a joke and that everything is fine for real. Yeah well he didn\u2019t believe that and had to pass this on to the school counsellor who I hate with a passion, as well as the other house-leaders, one of them being a favourite teacher who then sent me a message telling me how much she cares (I cried yikes) and then called my mum. Thankfully this was the last day of the week for me but now I have to face all of them on Monday, and I now realise how much of a mistake this was and how much this is going to affect me all because I was stupid.

So, she's throwing a going away party today and invited all of our friends and a bunch of other people to the party. It was supposed to be this huge pool party and then when they were done they would go back to her house for a sleepover. I really wanted to go but my family planned a camping trip for the same day. The camping trip also meant I wouldn't be able to see her before she moved. \n \nSide note: I hate camping more than anything else in the world. It's my least favorite thing ever. There's nothing worse to me than spending a week in a tiny crowded camper with my family of five in the middle of the wilderness with no wifi in the summer. \n\nI told Hannah I couldn't go to her party so she offered to let me stay with her for the duration of the trip so I wouldn't have to go. I told my own mom this and she said I  couldn't do it, for no apparent reason too. \n\nAnother side note about my friend Hannah: She has really bad depression and anxiety. I was worried that the stress of the move might trigger some of that so thats why I really wanted to stay with her for the week also. \n\nI told my mom all of my concerns and all of this and she still said no. All of this made me extremely angry and upset so I decided to cut. I told my mom later that night and she basically shamed me for cutting and made me feel like shit. She was like \"Why would you show me this? Why? Are you trying to make me feel bad for not letting you stay at Hannah's? I truly dont know what to say to you anymore. I've lost all trust in you. I dont think I can leave you alone anymore. I just.... why would you show me this? Why?\" She made me feel 10 times worse than I already did. And now I have to spend a week with her while camping.\n\nEdit: We arrived at the campsite and my mom had the audacity to tell me that \"other kids have it worse than me\" and that \"I should just suck it up\" and that \"I could choose to be miserable or choose to be happy.\"", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Sometimes, I wonder if I'm just not built for this world. If maybe I'm not mentally strong enough to take on anything and if maybe I should just take my life because I feel like I cant accomplish anything.\n\nAnyways, hi, my name is Autumn, I'm 19 y/o transgirl and I graduated high school last year. As far as I'm aware provided my psychologist and psychiatrist are correct I have Borderline Personality Disorder, Asperger's Syndrome, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and ADHD. I've always had a hard time growing up. I was bullied so much in school, my parents werent the best, they physically abused me when I was a child, and mentally abused me in middle/high school. A part of me doesnt hate them (at least my mother) because I feel like they're not trying to hurt me nor do they hate me, they just dont know how to properly raise me or approach me. They just decided to go the \"old school\" route of hitting me until I got better grades. Anyways, I hate my father. He's a manchild with anger issues who does destructive things and I wish he would just disappear. \n\nAnyways, onto my personal life with friends. I am severely emotionally unstable, I experience things in extremes and I always constantly split between loving and hating my friends. I constantly fear being abandoned or left alone and result in drastic measures to avoid those situations, I selfharm, I spend so much money. Haha, I had a job with an income of 1.6k monthly without any bonus commission, but I'd spend all of it on everything. I cant control it. I always ended up burning bridges with my friendships, I didn't mean to, I dont want to. But I cant control my behaviors and I hate it. I'm trying real hard to go to therapy, I'm hoping I can start DBT to help me with my BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder).\n\nI just want to have friends I interact with on a regular basis and play games with. I try my best to reach out but I guess others are busy playing with their friends or just overall not noticing me. Which can really hurt I guess. One recent thing I've really gotten into is FFXIV. I try to ask other friends to play but, I just get ignored and such. It hurts a lot. I dont hate them I think, I dont. I just, I wish I had friends they have and play with. It gets really boring and lonely. Aside from those things, sometimes, I wonder if everything would be better if I was dead. You see, I never knew escapism existed until a few months ago, and that's when I realized how for the past 19 years my coping mechanism of constantly retreating to the fantasy world I've created in my head was extremely unhealthy, and because of it I dont see any reason in going on, I think what's stopping me now is how Ill informed I am with taking my own life and how afraid I am of coming out with permanent damage and not death. Aside from that, there are 2 other people whom I love very much and cant bear to leave alone. My dream job is to edit videos for a YouTube channel or do something game grumps-esque with a friend. I'd love that so much, but that's just a dream, given the current state of YouTube and everything like that, the chances are that's not going to happen. Sometimes I just wish I could fall into a permanent sleep and live forever in my dreams.\n\nAnyways, thanks for letting me rumble a bit. I'm not happy. I'm not okay. I dont want to be alive. But maybe i can make it through, i just sometimes wish i had friends like others I see, but I'm extremely shy and suck at conversation and such, its really hard. I think I'm going to go cry some more now, I'll see you all some other time. \n\nIf you took the time to read through all this, thank you... from the bottom of my heart.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I'm new here. so i started yeeting today.. at least kinda. this all started from my fucked up grades.\n\nSo school is ending in a week and my grades are supposed to be out next monday, but then our school *has* to use managebac, which is a grade managing website and torture us all by telling the scores right away after every assignment and also provide feedback as to why I got such an such score, depending on the criteria (my school is an IB school, so number grades from 0\\~8 for normal assignments and 0\\~7 for the end of year/). My mom is not your typical tiger parent, but still cares about grades and shit cuz 'that determines my future' and stuff;; which it actually does. I want to go to a really well-known private school in the USA, so ig it does. so she checked managebac, and about 4 subjects out of 8 have (or will definitely have) the score of 7 out of 7 yet she still focuses on the remaining 4, and how i probably will get a 6 out of 7 (or 5 for the one subject I hate, which is PHE smhh;; i'm not sure yet tho, but i'm pretty sure it's gonna be a 5). So keep in mind that school is ending in a week, and all the scores are mostly finalized; both for the final assessments and the final overall grades, and many of the teachers clearly explained that there is no retest/regrading for these last assignments. But my mom decides to say 'no you should email the teachers for another chance! smh it's really *that* easy to do. right?' Somehow she doesn't understand that there's no going back now, since theres a *week* of school which is just play time, and not only does that disturbs the teachers, it's also unchangeable at this point, like every single fucking teacher mentioned. Whenever I try to explain that to her, she says 'It's because you're not confident enough/you didn't try enough. If you really *did* try, you would have gotten a higher score. It's all your fault for playing around, not doing what you're supposed to do.' well;; i did actually try?\n\nso out of rage and annoyance and some depression that has been piling up inside of me for months, i decided to yeet. My yeeting rn is really light tho cuz i can't muster up the courage to do anything deeper.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\noh also back story: around March my parents and i had a fight cuz i wasn't getting good grades, so I told them out of desperate urgency that I'll get all 7s for my final grades, and they said that if I didn't I wouldn't be going to my school anymore and moving back to the city I used to live in before. So this is a big deal and stuff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsry for that long nonsensical rant/vent thing;; it probably doesn't even make sense to y'all i'm pretty sure i'm missing something in this story but;;whatever...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nif anyone actually read this and understood this i'm impressed.

TLDR on the bottom .\nOk, so, here\u2019s some context: \nlast week it made 1 year since the last time I\u2019ve selfharmed. \nI\u2019m 20yr old and have been cutting since I was 12. I started therapy at like 13 or so for it. I was doing it everyday back then and after a year or 2 of therapy it was like a couple times every few months thing instead. From 15 &amp; on I wasn\u2019t really cutting because I switched to another unhealthy coping mechanism, substance abuse, instead \ud83e\udd2a!don\u2019t do drugs kids! This bitch is 2 1/2 yrs sober now tho uwu \n\nSo moving on to the actual topic~\nFrom age 16 til now it\u2019s been like a once a year thing but it hasn\u2019t been like... an accident? Like it\u2019s not impulsive, not acting out from my emotions, not for any real reason at all tbh \nThe one year mark will hit and I just feel off. I keep thinking about it and wanting it. Looking up pictures of it and watching YouTube videos about people\u2019s scars. And eventually I\u2019ll end up planning a day to actually go thru w it. I\u2019ve only ever gotten to like 1yr 8months. I enjoy the rush it gives and it\u2019s such an addictive feeling. I used to do it when I felt so much emotional pain I couldn\u2019t handle it but now I want to do it because it feels good and makes my body feel icy. I am into masochism and do enjoy pain but self harm is so frowned upon that no one ever listens to the reasoning I have for it and the guilt from letting other people down is the only thing to keep me from doing it. \nDon\u2019t get me wrong, self harm is awful and dangerous and I\u2019m in no way condoning or trying to glamorize it, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the only person who feels this way about it so I\u2019m asking y\u2019all \nSo.\n\nTL/DR;\nI no longer self harm for emotional release like I used to, but now I enjoy self harming as a way of unmatchable pleasure. \n\nDoes any one else feel this way regarding self harm? \nDo you wish you could do it more without consequence? \nIf you can\u2019t relate,, what are your thoughts on this mess of a situation I always put myself in?", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

They are struggling and don't know how else to deal with their pain. It's not their \"fault\" or something they're doing to hurt you. God wants to heal them, and you can help. Galatians 6:2 says to \"bear one another's burdens.\" How can you love your friend and show them that they matter to you and to God?\nIf you are struggling with self-harm yourself, please find help in a trusted adult right now. Even though these actions may seem like they help, they could eventually develop into even greater struggles like addictions to drugs, alcohol, or even eating disorders. In fact, you may be dealing with some of that right now. But, my friend, you don't have to suffer alone.\nWhile all addictions are hard to overcome, help and treatment are out there and available\u2014recovery and freedom are possible. We believe that no matter what you're wrestling with\u2014self injury, depression, drugs and alcohol, body image issues, sexual addiction, or other areas of brokenness\u2014God can heal all things (1 Peter 2:24; James 5:16; 2 Corinthians 4:16).\nIs cutting linked to suicide?\nSelf-injury may not always be about attempting suicide, but the damage done while harming oneself always carries the risk of inflicting serious, and even lethal, results, regardless of whether suicide is intended or not. The continued cycle of addiction and self-harm, as in substance abuse and other eating disorders, can have a destructive effect on one's health both physically and mentally, and the struggles can worsen over time without treatment [2].\nIt's not too late to stop.\nIf you are practicing self-harm, please talk to counselor or pastor as soon as you can. Depression may be very real, but it doesn't have to be the end of your story. You have the power to make the choice to seek help and recover (Philippians 4:13). It may be hard to imagine, but God intended for your life to be awesome. \"When the righteous cry for help, the Lord hears, and rescues them from all their troubles\" (Psalm 34:17).\nCutting very often stems from a very low view of self, seeing yourself as worthless or invisible, which is totally countered and met by the reality of God's love. Listen to the words of Jesus in Matthew 11:28-30. He's talking to YOU: \"Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\"", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I attended that for 11 days, I then got out and attended another school therapy place for about 14 days where I met some really nice people. But then I had tried to overdose so had to go back to inpatient at a place called Millwood, I was there for a whole 7 days. But when I got out I chose not to do another php program because I wasn\u2019t very fond of them. After about 60 days of being free I started to self-harm again and I was of course caught. So I got sent back to Mesa Springs, for 11 days.  Then about 12 days later I got caught self harming again, so I was sent to a JPS for 3 days while I was held on isolation there until they found a place to transfer me to, it was a pllace called Springwood this time, my estimated stay was 5-7 days but I ended up staying there for 11. After that whole conundrum I\u2019ve been out and clean ever since April 25, 2019. I\u2019ve also went to my first pride parade yesterday on June 2nd.

Because of this I\u2019ve been quite down and often procrastinate and waste time which I never used to do. I never felt like this until this year and I was always really happy so I guess I\u2019m not good at coping with these feelings. I generally put lots of effort into my work and do quite well so I have quite high expectations of myself and I feel like everyone else does too which adds to the pressure.\n\nA couple weeks ago I kinda picked at my arm with my fingers a bit until it was raw and lightly hit myself in the stomach a bit but it was only for two days and I didn\u2019t want to make it a thing and I haven\u2019t felt the need to do something like it since. But today I wasted loads of time and I\u2019ve suddenly got so much work to do and exams are coming up and I was really angry at myself so I punched the wall lots of times and punched myself a lot and put something solid into a sock then swung it round to hit myself with it (idk if that makes sense lol).\n\nI don\u2019t want to really injure myself when I do it but I want to see a lasting mark and it feels really good to relieve the stress.

I use it as a means to punish myself when I don\u2019t have control. I met my partner a year and a half ago and they were aware of my habit when we met.\n\nThe other night we got into an argument (unrelated to the self harm) and they stormed off for some time to calm down. I felt so guilty for upsetting them to that degree and not being able to make the situation any better. I didn\u2019t want to leave any serious damage , but I felt the need to punish myself so I only scratched my arms and legs to get some of out.\n\nAbout an hour later they came back into the room after calming down and they saw the scratches. \nThey\u2019ve asked me to stop a hundred times and told me I don\u2019t deserve to punish myself in the past.\nI understand that to a point enough is enough, and they flipped out completely.\nThey started yelling at me for not reaching out to them before I did it, but because they asked for alone time I wanted to respect that and not make it about me.\nThe anger was understandable, but there was one thing that went a too far.\nThey started calling me an addict, said I was like a crackhead, that I\u2019ll never get better, that I\u2019d probably be this way the rest of my life. \nI broke down even harder and after they realized what they had said they apologized for taking it that far and tried to take it back.\nI\u2019m not much of a fighter and I wanted the situation to be over so I just accepted it and apologized over and over.\nDespite that, I haven\u2019t been able to get those words out of my head.\nI\u2019ve never made a conscious effort to stop because I felt like if I did and then relapsed I\u2019d feel a million times worse. Most of the people in my life were very desensitized to my habit (including myself), my current partner gets the most devastated over it, which makes me feel even more guilty, but I don\u2019t know how to channel my guilt or feel control without it, especially in situations like these. \nI\u2019m not sure what to even make of this, I guess I just needed to find a place to vent.\n\ntl;dr - My partner and I got in an argument and I hurt myself to punish myself for upsetting them, they got even more upset and called me an addict, and said that I\u2019d never recover.

Given I wasn\u2019t completely innocent, I\u2019m not trying to play victim here. But what those girls did to me is something I wouldn\u2019t wish against my worst enemy. So me being my bitter self wanted them to regret ever touching me. So I wanted to show them physical evidence of what they did. (Which is ridiculous considering I moved away, I guess it was a just in case thing\u00bf) but it was also a cry for help. I\u2019d be terrified of other people seeing my cuts, but also pray to god someone would see them so they could see how much I needed help for my inner turmoil at the time. Yes, I did it for attention. Yes, it didn\u2019t necessarily start out for me to distract myself from any pain.  I feel guilty for that, considering that people had real reasons instead of learning about it online and trying it out myself. I have horrible time recollecting memories, but strangely I have a very vivid memory of my first time, and especially what I was thinking. I remember thinking that I could stop whenever I wanted to, I wasn\u2019t going to make it a constant thing. Just for now until I got some real help (because I was too ashamed and a pussy to ask for actual help) but then it started to become an actual comfort, and the more I did it the more I liked it. When i felt shit about myself, I\u2019d punish myself and feel balanced again. When I was breaking down from a hard trigger, I\u2019d cut and I\u2019d calm down. I recovered after I finally got help. It was HARD. But I did it. Until a few months ago when I hard relapsed. It\u2019s not nearly as bad as it was, but I do it to balance myself out. But also because (blood trigger warning) I really enjoy seeing my own blood. There\u2019s something beautiful about it and I get so happy when I see it and feel accomplished that I was able to do something painful in order to see something I wanted. When I\u2019m in emotional pain I do it to distract. But when I\u2019m in no pain and just get the urge to do it, it\u2019s a bit harder so I have to put effort into it. Which is why I feel accomplished when I do. I get so happy seeing my own blood and it\u2019s so beautiful to me. But then after I realize how fucked it is and how disgusting I\u2019m being. I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m going to try to receive therapy soon again but financial situations might not align. Is anyone going through something similar? I need to know why I\u2019m addicted to seeing my own blood, why I feel incomplete when I don\u2019t give in to the urges. It\u2019s starting to even hurt personal friendships (from people who know and want me to stop) but I can\u2019t seem to stand my ground for long enough and hard enough to resist. I know I can, but I just don\u2019t. And i feel horrible about it. I have tried looking for an explanation why I like it so much but I can\u2019t find anything", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

It always bled, but barely. Its been about a month and a half since I last cut, and I seriously thought the last time I had would be the last ever. But, I lost my last 3 irl friends after they betrayed me and lied to me so they could eat lunch without me. I hated them for that, and even though I had almost gotten outta depression entirely, it came back and I feel worse than ever before. Especially about a week and a half ago. I have a boyfriend but he's always busy. I talk online with him a lot, but since I started dating him 3 months and 1 day before now, I've only hung out with him 3 times. And recently he has been online a lot less and talking to me a lot less online. I know it's because he's busy but it made me feel so much worse. I then realized that, there are some people made just to suffer and I must be one of them. I needed someone to talk to now, but both my boyfriend and my only friend left who lives across the country are offline. I have NO ONE else to talk to. I'm so close to self harming again. I don't want to though. I sorta grew attached to my body, probably since its one of the last things I have left, and now I don't wanna ruin my arm. I know I'll cut a lot deeper if I do it again, but I don't want any cuts on my arm. I don't know what to do anymore. Not only that, but my mind has been full of homicidal thoughts. I wouldn't actually kill someone though. This alone is enough for me to think I need to be in a mental hospital, though my parents wouldn't let me even if I asked them. They knew I used to self harm, they were there when the police came to stop me from killing myself and I lied saying I wasn't since I had already decided not to at that point and they find out about my lie, yet they have done anything to help besides making me go to a crappy psychiatrist who can't diagnose people or give them medicine and made me feel worse and cut myself after I went. And they knew it made me feel worse. I don't go anymore, but I do have an appointment with an actual psychiatrist I think next Friday. But its not soon enough. And on top of that, I'm stressed for tomorrow at school. I was absent today due to nausea, and I have a speech to give tomorrow on my time in middle school. I haven't filled out most of the outline since its about things I did there yet I did nothing (not even clubs of field trips), were not allowed to have a written script, and I've never done a speech in that class specifically before. And then on Thursday I have to do \"Hot Seat\" where we have to say something nice to everyone in the class and it has to be genuine. I don't even know over half of their names. I don't know what to do at this point. All this makes me want to self harm so much but I know I shouldn't.\nI had decided at one point recently that if my life doesn't improve at least a little bit by the end of next school year, I'll kill myself. And it really isn't looking promising at all. I want to now, but I won't yet, mainly because I can't think of losing my boyfriend over it. And it just makes me wanna cut more.\nThis was unnecessarily long, and so thank anyone who read all of this. I guess I just needed to vent, but had no one to do it too. (And I swear to god if someone downvotes this/ write something mean like almost all my other posts have had that were in depression/self harm/suicide/mental\nhealth related subreddits I'mma be so mad and definitely cut.

In my case worked better healing cuts than getting rid of scars. (Takes 1-2 weeks).\n\n\u2022 Any kind of **oil** that contains **Aloe Vera**, or raw Aloe Vera. I just applied it on my skin and gentle massaged it for 10 minutes. (Takes 2-4 weeks).\n\n**HOMEMADE.**\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford or simply can\u2019t get those you can use the recipe I used for fading red scars:\n\n**Baking soda + Raw Honey + Lemon Juice.** Mix it and apply it over your scars and massage it for 10-15 minutes, then wash it up with hot water. \n\n**(!) Use it only twice a week or else you\u2019ll damage your skin.** In two days the redness of your scars should be fading away.

It ended with him criticizing me for saying his drinking can't be compared to my SH and justifying his vices, even though it was his idea.\n\nHe's out of town for work for the next 3 weeks but said he wanted me to be able to still lean on him for support, which is something I've never done before, and it's going badly. After not responding for over an hour after saying he'd call in a minute (because he was hanging out alone with another girl and lost track of time with her while I checked my phone anxiously until 1am), I finally talked to him. I asked him to be a bit more communacative in these situations and left it at that. \n\nInstead of pressing the self destruct button and making mountains out of mole hills I just told him about how I'd been having a rough night emotionally and that I felt beyond repair. His response to that was that he was probably gonna get some food and go to bed.\n\nI cried myself to sleep last night and am really struggling to convince myself not to SH anymore. I told my therapist and he basically told me to keep doing what works for me until I move and can start over in a couple months. But for now that just means I'm stuck and the waiting is killing me.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I work a job right now where I talk to people pretty often and for some reason, they can be the nicest people that I've talked to in weeks, but after I've interacted with them I'll feel scary bad and start thinking about cutting and burning until there is nothing left and I just wanna get away from it all. I'll also feel like I really want a hug but then I remember that I'm covered in needles so I'll just loop back to wanting to hurt myself for thinking that someone would ever hug me which I think leads me to the conclusion that I should just disappear and live somewhere where nobody else really is. I know I wanna kill myself too but I can't really do that since it'd destroy the people who I love so I think running away is the best/closest option without hurting anyone else too much. \n\njust ranting i guess idk", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Wondering if anyone else feels this way. \n\nIt\u2019s always assumed that self-harm is based in self-loathing. Conceptually it makes sense: you\u2019re damaging your own body. And I\u2019m sure for a lot of people that is what it\u2019s about. \n\nFor me, however, it\u2019s a bit different. It\u2019s like the wounds are already there, and I\u2019m just helping them into full existence. I am there to treat myself to the feeling of release. The pain endorphins. The rush. I don\u2019t have any interest in harming my body, but I do, because it feels good. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing though: the therapeutic part for me has always been the part right after, when I dress my wounds. I like to cut really bad sometimes because it takes more effort to maintain a wound like that.  It takes effort, attention, and care. \n\nBasically, here\u2019s the point. I\u2019m lonely, that\u2019s where my pain comes from. I want to be loved and taken care of and respected. And nobody makes me feel that way better than I do after I\u2019ve just cut myself up. I keep them clean, I use antibiotic ointments, I have a nice supply of gauze and tape and bandaids and everything. I check on them every so often, I cheer them on as they heal, and I keep my skin very hydrated in that area. \n\nFor me, it\u2019s not the harm that has me addicted.

The stigmas are hurtful and it\u2019s hard not to pass harsh judgement on myself for hurting the people I love indirectly by choosing to be selfish rather than seek out help.\n\nBut the reality is that I was young, I had some serious unresolved trauma, I didn\u2019t know any better. I didn\u2019t have the maturity and strength to seek out help until later so I dealt with my pain the only way I knew how. I know there was at least one occasion where I was between cutting and suicide. The past is a bridge to nowhere and I am the person I am today for it: hopefully kinder, wiser, and more sensitive to the needs and afflictions of others. But I have an unhappy history written on my body that I don\u2019t want to reveal to others, partially because I want to be perceived as \u201cnormal\u201d, and I\u2019m afraid a younger person will see me and come to think of self harm as an acceptable way to control their pain. The fact is that you can\u2019t control your pain, only feel it and go about dealing with it - in other words, the wound may not be your fault, but healing it is your responsibility.\n\nSo I turn the question over to you. How do you practically go about hiding your scars or, if you choose not to, why? I\u2019ve come to favor Bermuda shorts, sundresses with short leggings, and good old jeans paired with light blouses. I\u2019ve also found silicone sheets to be *extremely* effective - far more effective than I ever thought. Highly recommend, especially for stubborn keloid scars.\n\nStay safe, folks. I look forward to hearing your responses.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Far enough so I don\u2019t have to hear them and more importantly; interact with them.\n\nI like my quiet.\n\nI like my solitude. \n\nI sat there in my bed, the sweat from my brow  mixing with tears slowly running down my face. \u2018Damn\u2019, I thought to myself. \n\nI must have dreamt about him again. I looked over at his side of the bed as I absentmindedly fondled the prescription bottles of Klonopin &amp; Seroquel in my fingers. Empty- his side of the bed was empty.  Why wouldn\u2019t it be? He had been dead and cremated a year ago.\nThe memories of him, of us- were exponentially more vivid and more painful to relive at night. \n\nMemories that should be reassuring, bringing peace of mind were unusually disturbing- disjointed- like an alternate \u2018director\u2019s cut\u2019 of our lives together. \n\nEspecially this night.\n\nMy stomach growled as though it were empty, which- it might be; I don\u2019t recall if I ate at all that evening. \nI know I fed the cat. She was at my side regarding me with her \u201cWhat\u2019s up, papa\u201d look on her face.\nMy stomach grumbled again with surprising intensity- almost like a dry-heave that doesn\u2019t quite make it past your lips; seeming eager for the bottle\u2019s contents, but it was more than likely protesting the abuse I was about to inflict upon it. \n\nAgain.\n\nIn one bottle was the anti-psychotic medication (Seroquel) prescribed to me by my shrink as part of my \u2018Grief Management\u2019 in the other one was Klonopin for my anxiety. Both were part of \u2018The Programme\u2019. \nHe said it would help with my \u2018issues\u2019, my grief and my anger at the world- at happy couples (fuck those guys) that passed me on the way to and from my job, at everybody and their perfect, happy fucking lives with each other.\n One  100mg tablet of the Seroquel  was supposed to be more than enough help me sleep. The Klonopin wasn\u2019t really supposed to be used in conjunction with the Seroquel before bed.\nAgain- the 100mg of Seroquel should have been enough to knock me out cold.\n\nExcept that it wasn\u2019t. \n\nIt seemed to only get me even more agitated at the dr.\u2019s prescribed dosage. So after the first night I began to gradually increase it by one, then two, pills. I just wanted to numb myself, numb my mind so I could rest. \n\nSoon, even that wasn\u2019t enough to help me calm down enough to sleep. I started adding the Klonopin without telling my doctor. It seems to be helping me significantly more; blending the two and chasing them down with an ice cold shot of Patr\u00f2n Silver. \n\nAfter making sure I had my bottle of Patr\u00f2n out of the freezer and on my nightstand; I began my \u2018Game\u2019, my \u2018Let\u2019s See If I Can Completely Numb My Mind And Body Enough To Knock Me The Fuck Out Cold AND Be Able To Wake/Get Up And Go To Work\u2019 game.\n\nI bit down hard on one pill between my teeth. It tasted horribly bitter, but the pills seemed to work faster if I chewed it up until I washed that powdery, bitter taste down with a swig of tequila straight from the bottle. I have to tell you: that ice-cold Patr\u00f2n Silver is a Godsend.\nOne by one I found myself munching both the Klonopin and the Seroquel like M &amp; M\u2019s; chasing each one down with an icy cold shot of Patr\u00f2n . \n\nBy the 4th round, my stomach felt like it was doing back flips as I swallowed down the last few pills in those bottles. \n(I\u2019m going to need to ask the doc for some refills later this morning.)\ninstead of feeling sleepy like I usually do, I began to feel disoriented and a little bit dizzy. \nAs tried to fight back the nausea rapidly progressing in my stomach, I seemed to have lost all control of my mechanical functions. I may have thrown up, I don\u2019t remember. The next thing I could recall was that I was face-down on my bedroom floor, my cat circling me, voicing her concern. There were so many things going on with me: I felt as if I were being pulled underwater; above the water being consciousness. I may have shit myself, I don\u2019t know.\nI felt like a was walking a tightrope- staying alive on one side- succumbing to the Klonopin/Seroquel/Patr\u00f2n induced \u2018sleep\u2019 on the other. It was so tempting to just give in and let go; I was just so, so tired.\n\nSomething in my gut told me if I were to succumb to the \u2018sleep\u2019 I was being pulled into, I wouldn\u2019t wake again. \nNot this time. \nHowever, I was beyond exhausted. Every inch of my body, mind and spirit felt chilled as I stopped fighting and let myself drift away into a dreamy, swirling darkness.\n\nThere were no sounds. There  was no light. There was nothing. Is this what purgatory was like? My body felt suspended in that place the living should not visit. The only thing that seemed to permeate above all else was the cold. The bitter kind of cold that cuts deep into your bones, right to the marrow.\n\nAll I felt was that cold. \n\nMy mind was devoid of emotion; a welcome respite from the unrelenting grief that seemed to adhere to me ever since Bj\u00f6rn was taken from me. \nThey called it an \u2018aneurysm\u2019. \nI called it the universe deciding to be a cunt that day. \n\nAt this moment (or through many moments) I was adrift in a pure vast nothingness. It was so cold. To me it felt as though it stretched on endlessly. I wasn\u2019t able to form coherent thoughts in this state. It felt like I didn\u2019t exist but was somehow still there, still aware. \nIn the periphery of my hearing it came, so quietly: \n\n\u201cWake up.\u201d \n\nStartled, I could feel my senses beginning to regain their function. I could feel the temperature in the room had dropped. \nAgain, louder: \n\n\u201cWake up.\u201d\n\nFeeling strength and coherence return to me, I recognised the voice- his voice. \nThe room was definitely colder. It was mid-August and i was shivering.\n\n\u201cWake up!\u201d\n\nI opened my eyes- still a little groggy, but fully functional and fully aware.\nI sat up cross legged on floor. \nMy God it was cold. I could see my breath like smoke in front of me. \nMy cat came trotting over, while meowing- and decided to make my lap a bed as she looked up at me.\nDo any of you own a cat? \nIf you do you know what I mean when I say she was looking at me with a mixture of worry, relief and comfort on her visage. \n\nI am fully aware that it isn\u2019t my time. Not yet.\nThis is just a ritual I do.\nTo help me forget, to help me sleep. \n\nA game, if you will- not unlike Russian Roulette. \nInstead of a single bullet, however; there are many Klonopin and Seroquel being washed down with some ice-cold vodka. \n\nThis is my game.\n\nAnd I play this \u2018game\u2019 night after night, after night...", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

The other day I had the thought that extreme religious groups (even extreme Catholics) sort of get a pass on self harm. \n\nTake self-flagellation, a traditional Catholic practice of whipping oneself as a way of cleansing sin and/or inflicting physical pain as punishment for sin. I know this practice is not common today, but in other cultures ritual scarification still is. \n\nMost people accept without question that self-harm means something is wrong with the person, and for valid reasons. I suppose most people assume that it points to a deep-seated problem, and it's that which concerns them, not the harm itself. But while researching scarification, I saw an interesting discrepancy in opinions. All articles about it (on Wikipedia or Vice or other body modification groups) stressed that scarification is not the same as self harm. But comments made toward anyone who wanted to scarify mostly expressed the opposite. I even saw one say something like \"Scarification is self-harm, no matter what artsy umbrella you try to hide it under.\" Which I found odd since most people don't consider tattooing to be self harm. \n\nWhy is that? What about the act makes people cringe? The level of pain? The permanence of the scarring? \n\n\nLet's assume medical concerns are put aside. Infection, bleeding, etc are the obvious answers. \n\nIf done safely, what is it that makes self harm so reviled?\n\nEdit: Missed a point I meant to bring up. What makes self harm less accepted than substance use? If a person is going through a rough patch and they start drinking heavily, their friends may be concerned. But not nearly as concerned as they would be if they knew the person had self-harmed.\n\n**If this post is not allowed here, can someone point me to a place I can discuss this?**", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

My little brother is being a teenager trying to bottle shit up throwing bad attitude while also being teary and fed up, my mom is paranoid of losing custody and smothering, and im just trying to keep it fresh and chill but ive had an ongoing migrane for the last two days\n\nI can barely sleep without nightmares, i can barely move i cant even draw rn. Its the least adult ive felt in a while and at the same time im the one taking my dads place caring about anything that goes on. If i dont cook nobody does if i dont clean nobody does if i dont tell my brother to sleep noone does. My mom even told me to take care of her.\n\nThe urges to relapse are practically yelling at my face i cant also fucking lose it theres gotta be at least one half grounded person in this house but i feel like a pressure cooker about to explode and i need to let it out with blood. I dont even have good blades rn bc its summer and my mom would notice but its driving me insane i cant even go to my friends anymore bc ive been so fucked up that ive exhausted any convo abt this without sounding absolutely pathetic i just wanna cut so deep i can cry about that instead of me and my self pity", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Nail Biting to an extreme extent that it sometimes starts bleeding. But I don't swallow the nail, I just simply spit it out somewhere.\n\n2. Biting and swallowing the skin around my nails. I have been doing this for a long time and to a great level. I have even starting biting and swallowing THE SKIN PART BELOW THE NAIL!!!!!! Like when you peel of your nail you will see there is a skin part there. I bite it and swallow it!!! The problem is that I don't even wash my hands. I only wash them before dinner. \n\n3. I bite my lips alot and they start bleeding. I bite my lips and then end up swallowing them too. In some cases they end up bleeding.  Sometimes they become so red that my friends say \" Did you use a lipstick? \".\n\n4. I bite the inner lining of my cheeks and mouth and end up swallowing it too. This results in constant pain until the time period in which it is automatically healed.\n\nAlso, the main reason is that I experience a lot of brain fog whenever I do these 4 activities and I am currently a student preparing for the most important exam of his life.\n\nAlso, if needed please read my recent posts in my profile to get a better picture of my condition.\n\nThank you in advance.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I don't know her that well but we have most classes together. As there were no tables free she sat next to me. I instantly tensed since I'm not great around people I don't know but she didn't talk to me it was fine.\n\nWhen the movement bell went I got up and began to gather up my stuff. I knocked my sketch pad/poem book on the floor and leant down to pick it up. My school blazer slid up my arm a bit in doing so.\n\n\"What are those?\" she asked,\n\n\"What are what?\" I replied getting really nervous. If anyone has seen your you might understand that fear you get.\n\n\"On your wrist?\"\n\n\"Hair bobbles.\"\n\nI ran out of the library. In first period she was late to class and I was so scared. During second period (just before break time) a TA came in asked if I could go to my head of year/PE teachers office at break. When it was break time (right before I had PE) I slipped off too the loo to put bands around my wrist and arm (mostly hair bobbles and stuff like that, as I cut my wrist and hips). I walked to her office and knocked on the door. She said \"Come in.\"\n\nI walked in nervously and she told me to take a seat. \"How are you?\" she asked.\n\n\"Okay, how are you miss?\"\n\n\"I'm good, you know you can talk to us about anything, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah...\"\n\nIt was silent for a few seconds and she was scrolling and reading on her computer.\n\n\"I have you for PE next don't I.\"\n\n\"Yeah...\" I am very shy and I my heart was so fast and my stomach felt so wired.\n\n\"Ok.\" It was silent again. \n\n\"Do you need anything?\" I asked\n\n\"No, if your fine you can go.\"\n\nFrom the look on face I knew she knew, and that she was planning something.\n\nUsually I slip out of the changing rooms and change in the toilet as our PE teachers usually do the register out side where we line up (before we change). However miss told us to go inside and that we would do the register in the changing room. This is not abnormal and we do it sometimes when it's raining. It was overcast (I know it's summer but in England it has been chucking it down).\n\nI had to go into the changing room. I changed in the back corner as quick as I could. The teacher was the other end and obviously couldn't see me. I put my PE uniform on (with the hoodie that goes with it). I was one of the  girls wearing leggings and a jumper but that was fine as about a third of us were.\n\nShe called us to sit on the floor at the front where she did the register and told us we were inside doing dodgeball.  It was going to be boys vs girls (because this is England we usually do separate PE so this was a surprise, I was soon realising that it was so there were two teachers, and one could leave the room).\n\nWe played a game and I was one of the last 3 in. I have no idea how as I am not sporty. Anyway, I was the only girl left and was trying to get the other two. I was hit though.\n\nMiss came over. \"Girls and boys, how are you all wearing jumpers, take them off, it's boiling in here.\"\n\nMany people were confused as it wasn't that warm. I nodded in agreement but kept quiet. However miss was adamant. I had covered my cuts with bands but I was so scared now. I went to the edge and took it off like the others. I stood at the back and miss didn't show any sign of looking towards me. We played another game and purposely dropped the ball when trying to catch it.\n\nI was sat at the back of the hall when miss tapped me on the shoulder and I turned around. She gestured for me to go with her so I followed. We stood in the corridor, her looking me u and down sceptically. I was attempting to shrink into the wall.\n\nShe asked why I was covering my wrist. I was silent. She sighed and I don't think I'll ever forget the look of pain on her face. She looked upset and I was because of me. She gently took my other hand and walked me into her office.\n\nI sat on one of the chars in front of her desk expecting her to sit behind it but she sat next to me. She looked me dead in the eye,\n\n\"What's wrong?\" I was silent. I just sat crossed legged on the chair (something I would usually never do) and stared at the floor. The whole time I was rightfully telling myself off for upsetting miss and becoming a burden to her.\n\n\"How long?\"\n\n\"Eight months.\" I whispered, she repeated me for confirmation.\n\n\"Can I see?\"\n\nI was silent. \n\nShe basically tried to get me to speak. This carried on until lunch when she finally let me go. She said someone would colledct me from music (fifth period) to tell me what would happen\n\nShe basically tried to get me to speak.

I have so many memories, feelings, stories about cutting stored away in my head that are all secret to everyone but myself and sometimes I want to just... talk about them? \n\nIt's not a catharsis thing, at least not in the traditional therapy way. I've made peace with it, and have a few awesome friends who know about my self harming and have actually been a big help in my recovery! I'm clean almost 3 months and I don't think I'll be relapsing anytime soon, so I don't want to talk to anyone about my feelings/urges/etc in the sense that I need to be reassured or encouraged. It feels more like sharing details of a trip you went on with someone who has never been there, or like you're explaining a process to someone for the first time. It's just affected me so greatly for so long and I have all these random experiences floating around in my brain that no one knows about except myself.\n\nLike, for example: I used to cut so badly I was probably borderline anemic from blood loss. I would pass out frequently at school anytime I was overwhelmed because I was so weak. One night after cutting I went to the bathroom to clean up and blacked out in the hallway. I laid there for a few minutes, numb and shaking and just waiting to come back into my body, and then slowly got up, cleaned myself up, and went back to sleep. I was 2 feet away from my parents bedroom and they never knew. I went to school the next day and no one knew. It was one of the most surreal things I've ever been through and I just want to share these types of experiences sometimes. I want to talk about all the things I've learned about the actual act of cutting itself, and my ritual of cleaning up and aftercare. Where I stashed my stuff, how I hid bandages under my clothes, random things that used to be my life now just bouncing around uselessly in my head. It feels weird that I'm probably going to forget most of it.\n\nI don't think I want sympathy I just feel pent up? I want to talk about all the stuff I kept to myself for all those years, but I don't think it's fair to make the people I love listen to that type of thing. It might be too uncomfortable and I really really don't want pity. I just can't believe this whole 6 year span of my life is basically a secret...\n\nHas anyone else felt this? How have you dealt with it? I don't know who to talk to. Maybe a therapist or something? I just don't want advice, you know? I'm clean, happy, and moving on with my life.

I've had times throughout that period where I wouldn't do anything, but like 3 months ago I made a really bad decision that I wish I could take back. I've been cutting for the past 6 years, but for the first time, I went to burning. I was overflowing with emotion, not just depression, but pain and anger as well. I burned a hole in my forearm so deep that the scar isn't even 100% healed now. Looking back, I regret it so much, because there are just these two huge pink patches on my arm that you can see from a mile away. And there's no good story to make up for this one. All my other scars have faded to white over the years, but this one is going to take a loooooong time. I just wish I didn't do it. I wish I could go back and tell myself that the temporary relief wasn't worth it. I almost had to get a skin graft too, which would've been even worse. I haven't had that feeling in a long time where I feel really uncomfortable going outside. But with these big pink patches on my arm, I just want to stay inside and avoid situations where people would see it. I don't want to be in public and I don't have friends looking for me to go over to their place. Looks like I'm back to square one. And basketball preseason for my college isn't too far around the corner, which means no sleeves at all. Oh boy. And to top it all off, my rock, my support, my love of over 3 years just broke up with me. My girlfriend had been with me through everything recently, and it took a toll on her with my deteriorating mental health, so I don't blame her. I just cry about it on the inside or out pretty much every day. We still talk, but she refused to answer the question if she wants to get back to together in the future. I asked her in a few different ways and all I got was, \"well there's always a chance.\" That's it. I'm in a really bad spot right now. I hope everyone out there reading this takes this as yet another reminder/reason not to self-harm. Please message me if you want to talk. All I do is sit around these days with my broken foot.

That's what happened yesterday, anyway, and there wasn't even much of a bad headspace. Just the fact that I had breakfast kinda late and so I didn't get hungry for lunch until around 3 which was an awkward time since I knew we had dinner plans at 5:30. So I latched onto the idea, and I waited until that hunger peaked a half hour later before I went through with it. \n\nOn the other hand, I also noticed a couple times this past week where once again, it was on the table (no pun intended), and I could feel myself getting hungry, but if I could push away the urge long enough to get some food I would back down from the decision.

The cuts aren't really that deep as of now though. I have one or two that would've needed stitches (that I didn't want because I didn't want my mum to know that I cut). My life has been terrible so far and today my boyfriend of 2 years who I love very much broke up with me. This tipped me over and now I think I'm ready to cut deep enough to bleed out. I've already left notes to people who I love and left them on my desk for them to find it. I put all of them in an envelope with a little drawing of something that reminds me of them. I feel like cutting my wrists along the veins is a good option for me unlike hanging or getting hit by a train because to me it feels more graceful. I hope someone feels the same way about that and that it isn't just me?  I want to wear a nice dress when I do it and lay in my bed until I bleed out. It will probably hurt for like a minute and then it will all go away. Ive already tried to kill myself in multiple ways and it never worked. When you're close to death, everything feels so peaceful and I would like to experience that to the fullest. I want my mum to hear me scream and come and tell me that I can let go. That I can go to heaven. I don't want people telling me to 'not do it' because i have 'so much life in front of me'. We all know those are lies. It doesn't get better. Don't lie to yourself or me.

I have PTSD and extremely vivid 'nightmares' which are really just memories of my trauma. It happens every night and it feels like my body is forcing itself to be awake until it can't any longer, just to avoid the stress of reliving those events. This ironically enough has caused me a great deal of extra stress. It doesn't help that when I do finally fall asleep I still get the nightmares. I had been on sleep medication but it stopped working and had terrible side effects.\n\nI have a lot of guilt surrounding my trauma and these nightmares and feelings are causing my impulse to self injure increase. Self injury is something I have been using to cope since before I experienced any trauma and so now I am spending each night tossing around and trying to keep from falling back into my ritualistic self injury routine. I had a small relapse already, just a few tiny scratches with a very sharp blade and my boyfriend saw, he was so upset he cried, of course he was completely understanding/supportive of me and asked that I at least try not to do it again. But I am trying it's just right now nothing else is helping, and I want to self injure more because of it.\n\nI feel so ashamed for it, and even more ashamed that I can't bring myself to put my mother's xacto knife back where it belongs. She had just bought two new ones, clean, shiny, silver and they even come with the little protective cover so you don't accidentally cut yourself when you aren't using it. I got so excited when I saw them and all I could think was \"she only needs one, and if she asks about it I'll just lie\". I know this is bad, I know I'm not supposed to do this but I need to self injure because I've been using my healthier coping skills but they arent helping now.  \n\nAll I want is to cover my arms in a million bloody cuts and then wrap myself in a sweater and move the fuck on with my life.

I had just been forced to leave the elementary school I considered a second home because my father couldn't afford to drive me to and from school each day anymore, and all of a sudden I was put into a situation where I was nearly completely alone (only a couple teachers I recognized as they had transferred from my previous school, but they were nothing more than familiar faces and names)  \nAnd I felt uncared for. \n\nEvery little minute felt like torture, a nightmare. And I couldn't wake up. This was when my depression REALLY took affect. I felt worthless, I felt like I was in a pit of despair.\n\nUntil I learned that I could harm myself to make the pain go away.\n\n\n(ONCE AGAIN TRIGGER WARNING DON'T CONTINUE IF YOU ARE SEVERELY AFFECTED BY THIS!!!!!)\n\n\n\nOn yet another night of tears and insomnia, with no one who seemed to care, I took the little pocket knife I had (it was a gift. Don't ask) and made my choice. \n\nFirst it was one.\n\n\nThen 2\n\n\nThen 3\n\n\nThen 4\n\n\n I realized with each little cut, I felt better. So I kept going\n\n\n5\n\n\n6\n\n\n7\n\n\n8\n\n\nI kept going until I was dizzy. Until my knife was stained, and my arm oozed blood outta more areas than I could count. I felt better. I felt.... calm. \n \nI fell asleep (after I cleaned up) to the therapeutic sting many of you probably ( I'm here if ya'll need to talk alright?) know all too well. \n\n\nI managed to hide it for a few days, until my father saw one of the  red lines I failed to hide. He. FREAKED. he threatened to take Me to the psych ward and I pleaded with him to not, and that I was sorry. He made me promise on my heart I wouldn't do it again. Of course, I obliged. It was an empty promise. I just did it in areas no one would see unless I was completely naked from that day forward. \n\nIt became routine for me to carry a blade into the shower with me, and my thighs stung with every rub against my pants... \n\nWhen I got my first (serious) girlfriend at 16 years old, we started to have sex about two months in, and she wondered why I wouldn't get fully nude with her. I initially avoided it, but eventually I told her, through tear filled eyes, That my thighs were covered in self harm wounds and scars. She was extremely supportive and ended up showing  me her own scars. She held me and told me That it would be OK and that she was here for me as I cried. (This girl did eventually go on to tear my heart into shreds after a year and 3 months... but we'll get into that later) \n\n\nFast forward quite a while, I'm 17, and I had just left for a six week training course with the RCAC. ( ROYAL CANADIAN AIR CADETS)\nIt was hot as royal balls out there. The location is literally classified as a desert. (a cool day was something like 30\u00b0C) by the 3rd week, I was miserable. I was alone, the food was trash, the heat was unbearable, and the drill was hell. Literally. \nI started cutting more and more. Even my own then girlfriend didn't seem to care. She was at an entirely different camp and was having  basically the polar opposite of my experience. I guess this is when she stopped loving me, but I didn't know that at the time. \n\nI was suffering, until I decided to break a razor and use it.\nSuddenly, my thighs were covered once more.\n\nIn order to keep it in check when I was out, I used a pen to draw on myself. It helped. Someone asked me why I drew on myself, but she already knew. She went on to be my best friend and I love her to bits. She's helped me so much since she met me. (Thanks Brianna. I love you so much)\n\n\n\n\nFast forward a couple months, and my then girlfriend breaks up with me over phone call. I broke. Completely. I was in love and she tore me apart, then she tells me all sorts of things that make me believe that our entire relationship was fake. That she stopped loving me after a point, began insulting my weight, my past, just tearing me apart. \nThat night, through tears and a massive desire to die, I tried to cut myself deep enough to end myself but my blade was too dull, so I just made myself bleed. A LOT.  \n\n\n\nThat's the latest major incident. \nI'm a month clean now.\nThanks for listening....", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Though he posed zero risk to himself or others, he was handcuffed, forcibly drugged, and locked in a psychiatric hospital for weeks against his will. I had experienced four involuntary commitments in my life, but witnessing him go through this traumatic experience led to me researching resources that could help him in his situation. By the end of the summer, I\u2019d traveled out to the west coast and met with members of MindFreedom International, and I began getting involved in what I came to learn was the consumer / survivor / ex-patient movement.\n\nThere was almost a decade between my first involuntary psychiatric commitment and my learning that this movement existed. Years were spent unnecessarily stumbling along on my own, seeking alternatives, trying to find allies, but always be alone in this journey and being hindered by constant self-doubt. Much like when I started getting involved in alternative education and it took a couple years before I discovered the already-existing world of self-directed learning and unschooling, I saw there was a need for a focused effort to connect those in need to the existing movements and resources that were available to them.\n\nIt was this need in mind that the Voices for Choices video series was conceived. \n\nThis video series, which consists of 13 videos, was a collaboration between many individuals including psychiatric survivors, alternative practitioners, artists, journalists, writers, and activists. I am grateful to have been given the opportunity to be a part of this project. I want to specifically thank a few people for their work. \n\nFirst and foremost, a special thanks to Sherri Huang, the Associate Producer and Editor who poured endless hours into video editing and making critical editorial decisions that steered this project in a direction that would maximize its integrity and impact. Her journalistic approach, creative vision and detailed editing skills have no doubt transformed this video series from being an amateur home video project assembled by a novice learning to use a camera for the first time into a professional, first-rate journalistic production that will change countless lives. I am incredibly grateful for the sacrifices she made with her time to bring Voices for Choices to life.\n\nI also want to thank the team at MindFreedom International, especially Sarah Smith, who was the champion of the grant which included the Voices for Choices series. While I was a part of the brainstorming session to plan the video, it was Sarah who took the lead in organizing all the documentation and drafting the grant proposal, securing the funding, and accommodating the regularly shifting deadlines that arose from my poor planning and execution. I\u2019m incredibly thankful for her making this project possible and being understanding in all the delays and requests for time extensions that I begged for. The Steering Committee including Cindy Olejar, Mary Maddock, Jim Maddock, Celia Brown, Ron Bassman, David Oaks, and Sarah Smith was also invaluable in navigating this long process of creating these videos and I am thankful to have had their experience and guidance.\n\nI also want to extend a sincere thanks to the Foundation for Excellence in Mental Health, whose financial support made this project possible. While I am often skeptical that receiving funding for creative projects can potentially limit their freedom to free speech, the Foundation was incredibly supportive of our work and I\u2019m grateful that I never felt constrained or fearful in the creative process. Thank you for believing in this project.\n\nI want to thank all of the interviewees involved in the project: Kumail Akbari, Frank Blankenship, Erik Bray, Celia Brown, Oryx Cohen, Emily McMurphy, Sera Davidow, Janet Foner, Al Galves, Chris Gordon, Jim Gottstein, Peter G\u00f3tzsche, Chris Hansen, Jill Kesti, Mary Maddock, Hilary Melton, Grace Nichols, David Oaks, Opeyemi Parham, Ron Unger, Robert Whitaker. I want to thank them not just for their time, but specifically for their trust. It is not easy to have someone point a camera at you and ask you questions about such challenging subject-matter, knowing that they will be cutting and splicing your words into a larger story. I\u2019m not sure I have that courage and am inspired by all those who did.\n\nI want to thank my long-time friend Mark Sturgess and his partner Adam Carver for providing the music accompaniment. I\u2019ve wanted to collaborate on a project with Mark for years and finally found the perfect opportunity. The music in this videos really captures the emotional tone in a way that I never could have imagined. Thank you for lending your talents to this project.\n\nLastly, I want to thank Sean Blackwell. I first discovered Sean\u2019s YouTube series \u201cBipolar or Waking Up\u201d in 2010, just a couple years after my involuntary commitment. It was the first glimpse I ever received into their being an alternative path to interpreting my experiences. I would say that his work directly inspired the strategy behind creating Voices for Choices series nearly a decade later. \n\nWithout further ado\u2026 please enjoy Voices for Choices and share them with everyone you know! We\u2019ll be releasing one video every week for the next 13 weeks. I can\u2019t wait to hear what you think!", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I doubted my mom loved me. I doubted my friends cared about me. I doubted my own ability in everything i do and now i doubt this. I have a piece of paper in some database proving i am depressed but that paper doesnt mean shit to me. Maybe it is part of the job to doubt your ever waking action. It doesnt help i am everything that is the stereotype. I am edgy, i do listen to sad music, i do cut, i am a romantic fool, i am the fucking stereotype i am a fucking joke to myself. Life doesnt feel real. It just feels like a really long joke and the punchline is nowhere in site. Every low i feel is the worst low i have ever felt. I hate living. I hate making people guilty. AM I FAKING THIS. YES I PROBABLY AM I A FRAUD I SMILED TODAY AND I PLAYED VIDEOGAMES AND I WAS HAPPY AND THEN I JUST DECIDED NOT TO BE FOR ATTENTION BECAUSE DEEP DOWN ALL I AM IS A ATTENTION SEEKING PIECE OF SHIT. i cant even do things now. Mowing the lawn. Playing Videogames. Showering. Fucking walking my dog. All i think about is death and how much my life is hell. Sometimes i just let the water run in the tub and i dont get in. I just sit there because i know if im in there i will just get intrusive thoughts. I Havent fucked showered in 4 days and everyone can tell. But i cant fucking get myself to do this bare minium shit im like a car that is breaking down. I wake up in the middle of the day and do My work and then fall asleep and that is my life. The only time i am happy is in my dreams. And even then i dont remember them. I dont remember when I'm fucking happy in general. You know how people have rose tinted glasses? I have the opposite. All my happy memories are stained with all the tiny embarassing anf stupid things i did. I dont remember kissing my girlfriend i remember being a pansy fuck and not kissing her at first. Fuck my memories even i have zero good ones. And the fucking problem is i cant tell anyone. And i bet there will be someone like \"oh you can tell me.\" NO FUCK YOU. I CANT BE HELPED. PEOPLE WANT TO HELP AND WHEN THEY CANT THEY FEEL BAD AND THEY DONT LIKE BEING AROUND PEOPLE THAT MAKE THEM FEEL BAD SO FUCK OFF. and thats why all my friends left me because im a whiny fucking pussy who didnt pull the trigger when he said he would and he didnt hang himself when he said he would and they didnt care to fucking begin with but now they are gone. Everyone fucking leaves so whats the fucking point of trying when i get hit down at every turn. Everything i love dies or leaves and i wouldnt be surprised if my family just decided to leave not that i care because they treat me like a fucking alien i would rather suffer in silence than deal with this shit and having them baby me because they are afraid i will kms. its my fucking if i pull the trigger and you cant take that away from me. I remember being young and wondering what it took for someone to do something so crazy and commiting suicide and aparently all it takes is two shitty friends to push a mental ill man into it. She knows who she is and of course she will do everything wrong. She will isolate me and hurt me more. Thats the fucking problem when people think they know better than you. NO THEY DONT. i know what is best for me and you leavinn wasnt for my mental health it was so you could  date krieg with having guilt about the boy that you fucked over. The one who lost me my gf. The one who made fun of me behind my back. The one that isolated my life. I hate myself. You all know what is next.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

His friend  immediately goes \"What in the FUCK happened to your arm?!\" My friend goes \"She got burnt by grease at her work.\" (A lie, but one for me). His friend doesn't believe it, and starts to make a self harm joke. My friend nudges him and says quietly \"Dude. Seriously. She's insecure about that stuff.

The last time was last fall, when I was at Job Corps and almost everyone hated me and my roommates wouldn't let me sleep. (Lack of sleep does crazy stuff to people. I really wanted to kill my roommates, but I realized that would just make everything worse because I'd go to jail, so I took out my anger on myself.) Before that, I hadn't cut since a few months before I finally got off a bunch of unnecessary medication. (I was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder and I was on tons of mood stabilizers. They interfered with my ability to see patterns and possibilities, and since seeing patterns and possibilities is such an essential part of my true personality, having it taken away by medication was very detrimental to my mental health. If you know anything about INFPs in Fi-Si loops, you'll understand why. I was already in a Fi-Si loop before I was put on that medication, but that medication prevented me from getting any better.) Before that, it had been years, if I remember correctly. For me, it was mostly about punishing myself, although there was also a feeling of... Relief, I guess? Now I'm doing much better. I'm taking an antidepressant that works really well for me and I'm no longer in that hell known as Job Corps. Most of the time, I feel happy, or at least neutral. But a little bit ago, I was practicing opening my pocket knife (which I recently bought for self-defense) with one hand and I kind of wanted to cut myself, even though I feel just fine.

My mom uses me to take out some of her aggression but I don't blame her because I have a very calm attitude and don't give much attention or effort. Not to mention I gave up half way through the year in math class and failed so I have to go to summer school in a different town which no one has time to drive me to. Also my friends are great to talk to but no matter what I do they find a way to frame me as abnormal and creepy for example when I am my usual self they say I look like an idiot because i just sit with a blank look and when I talk they call me a loud freak. Not to mention they talk about me behind my back and tell me about how people think I'm a freak. I just try to please everyone and I fail every time so the cutting is more of a way of punishing myself. Anyway I don't want to die I want to keep living but I don't want to be here anymore.

I don't want to risk the chance of passing out, or hitting a vital artery, or someone (especially my mom) seeing my scars (not that she wants that).\n\nBut at the same time, I wish I had the guts to cut without thinking. I wish I could find the sharpest knife in my house and press as deep as I can. I LOVE seeing my scars heal. I take pictures and keep track of it, I always have. I know this is a very unhealthy habit. Whether it's deep, not often, visible or not, I'm still sh-ing. This is still unhealthy, so why do I feel like I'm not allowed to talk about it?

I cut my legs mostly (not overly deep) and it does just fine at releasing the hurt, pain and trauma I feel whenever I cut. \nI have long and deep emotional psychological wounds from military service where everything from rape, bullying and cover ups happened - to childhood abuse, sexual and physical.\nI can\u2019t work. I lost my high profile employment because I can\u2019t cope.

AND GOD IT FELT SO LIBERATING. i haven't done it since but i am planning on it but really, no one i know in real life can understand how much mental work it took me to get to this freaking point and how hard i worked for this to happen and i just wanted to share this with someone. if you're like me and don't feel strong enough: ONE DAY!

I\u2019m a big knife collector, so I turned to self-harm because it helped me let out some of the pain. This all happened around June 23, 2015. After some time with my new girlfriend, I told her about my struggles and went clean on July 9, 2016 and have been ever since. However, I\u2019ve always had a shaking curiosity about why self-harm helps? I\u2019ve always had a slight fascination with seeing my own blood (which has always been strange as I see myself as a fairly typical kid and not necessarily the \u201cemo\u201d archetype that you might expect) and I read a few articles that mentioned emotional pain being alleviated by physical pain - so I just stuck with that explanation until recently. \n\nBack to today: Lately its been a little rough for me. Summer has been really stressful and , although I have not quite turned back to self-harming, I have partially thought about it. After pondering all the times I\u2019ve hurt myself in the past and why I like seeing my blood so much, I realized that the blood makes me feel powerful and in control (as it may for some of you reading this). As if I have a \u201cbattle scar\u201d and it makes me feel confident to have that sense of success that \u201cI can bear through the pain and here is my physical reward for it.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m 100% not saying that this is the solution to the problem. I want to clarify that it\u2019s most definitely a short-term \u201csolution\u201d for the problem that can spark various negative long-term effects. However, I wanted to share what I have pieced together over my years of confusion. This is the reason I followed through with my destructive actions, but that time has passed as I\u2019m near my 3 year anniversary of getting clean. \n\nI hope that my insight may fill a gap in someone\u2019s story that will give a little closure. Something that you can be sure about in a time of confusion - a reason for the destructiveness. And I hope that understanding this can help somebody reading to find a replacement for their personally harmful actions.

Im too much of a whimp to just do it, but instead im scared of having the scars for life in case someone I care about sees them and hates me even more than they already do. Make fun of me for having them, like Ive seen my father do to other people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould I just do it and stop being such a whimp?", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

So to summarize my history with sh - I started around 9 years old, and I think I started because I saw that others did it to communicate their depression into reality, and it appealed to me in that way. It progressed over the years, I tried to hide it sometimes and others it was almost shameless. Fast forward to my 18th birthday, and I'd decided to get clean. It wasn't easy but as I've gotten older it's almost sort of silly to me now. I had three single relapses, all of those times felt pointless. I went about 2 1/2 years clean. But the need came back.\nRecently... It's been hard to find a reason to not self harm. I'm no longer suicidal as I was as a younger kid, I don't get the overwhelming thoughts about it. I can't really explain why I started again. It was like an itch I just had to scratch. I just decided I didn't need to ignore the itch anymore.\nNow though it feels...good? Not the pain, but the sight of the aftermath, so to speak. That's all I can explain. Seeing the physical lines etc, make me feel sort of good. It's the only thing that soothes that need.\nI kind of feel like a joke when I think about it because I have no deep, dark \"why\". I'm not completely at the mercy of my depression and bipolar like I was when I was younger, when I started. \nDoes anyone else ever feel like this?

Anyway I'm currently 120 days clean I had about 3 years of self harming almost daily usually around 100-150 \"chicken cuts\" on each arm with maybe 5 deeper slower cuts along the wrist and never really went to the legs because it didn't have the same feeling if you know what I mean. I'd usually start with nice slow cuts along the wrist when I started because they felt better like I don't know quite how to describe it but it was such a good release to begin with like I'd typically have something in mind that I was punishing myself for wether it was something stupid I'd done on the day or a broader fuck up and then i'd start to get the feel of it and the cuts would get faster and more shallow (chicken cuts) because by that point I'd kinda shut off and start hating myself for cutting which translates into anger which led to more shallow cuts and then a sort of bloodlust would set in until I ran out of room and moved to the next arm which would then get really extreme until again I ran out of room and jumped in the shower which makes them sting as you know and in all honestly I used to sit there and cry for maybe an hour because by then I'd realised what I'd done and the guilt and the shame would kick in which again I'm sure you're probably familiar with. See I'm 17(m) my parents are separated and my mum moved to Nottingham with my step dad leaving me in Manchester in the house. This only lasted for a year and a half and they still came down on weekends so I had a break over the weekend befire starting again during the week. December 12th this year i had my 3rd suicide attempt but my parents found out about it and moved back down to Manchester. As I'm sure most of you can relate to my depression is like a rollercoaster, or at least that's how I'd describe it to my counsellor, there's periods where you return to your baseline which is quite low for me then there's periods maybe a week or 2 where you feel sort of okay and those 100 cuts turn to 10 or maybe 0 of you're lucky and then there's periods where you feel this intense sadness that encompasses your entire life, you don't want to eat or sleep or move you don't talk to friends you zone out in class you underperform in work. You know what I mean, for me these used to last for months but they started to get pretty short with theses periods lasting maybe a week, this combined with my parents moving back in resulted in my stopping cutting due to both fear of being caught and a lack of desperation. The last few months though these periods have been getting back to the point they were at and I've been getting really desperate to cut, so far I've used my nails or I've snapped bobbles just anything to get a tiny bit of relief without cutting but it just isn't enough. My friends have knives and there's been a few times where I've bullshitted my way into getting it and I've ended up cutting myself with it, never on the arms just fingers and I've cut my hand open once becaise they're easier to explain but I'm getting real fucking desperate to cut again and it's not something I want to start again because it ruined my relationships with a lot of people theres a lot of friendships that havent been the same since amd a lot of family members who dont know how to deal with it including my mum who first saw them in a dentist and started going mad at me in the very crowded waiting room and whenever she saw them would punish or threaten me rather than try to help. Any advice on how to prevent a relapse would be great because I've relapsed the last 3 times I've tried to stop.

Sorry for the wall of text. I'm having a really hard time being concise right now. \n\nI started self-harming again and I want to get help for it. I've been self-harming for a really long time, but this time is extra weird because I'm not really upset about anything. I don't understand why I relapsed. I have no idea why I'm even doing this -- I'll just think 'oh, I should self-harm now' and then I'll do it.\n\nThe cuts themselves aren't very serious so I don't believe I'm in any physical danger. Honestly I don't really feel anything at all about this. The only reason I'm even thinking about getting help is that I wrote all of it out and realized that if a friend was in a similar position I'd tell to see a psychiatrist. I just have no emotions anymore and it's really weird. \n\nAnyway. I was actually referred to a psychiatrist several months ago when I was in what I would consider more acute distress (as opposed to now, where I just feel absent) but the psychiatrist never responded to the referral request. My doctor resent the referral and again there was no response. So I've been waiting and waiting and nothing is happening. \n\nIn my city (I don't want to get too specific but it's in Ontario, Canada) seeking a psychiatrist on your own almost always means putting yourself on a six-month wait list. So I can do that, but ... six months is a really long time.\n\nAnother option would be to go to the emergency room. I've done this before and I know they'll give me an expedited appointment with a psychiatrist, but that still takes approximately three months. There's also a mental health specific emergency room and they'll give you an emergency appointment with a therapist within a few weeks, but they only do crises work so they'll support you for a maximum of a month and then you're on your own again. Also, they don't have any psychiatrists on staff, only therapists. \n\nFor various reasons that I'd rather not get into, I really don't want to go to a peer support group. \n\nThank you for reading all of this.

Now that I think about it, it's almost a daily routine of \"accientally\" bumping into the door handle. Biting too much of my cuticle off. Scratching when I'm no longer itchy. I've had a little kit of disinfectant, plasters and a pencil sharpener in my room for over 4 years now. I've only narrowed it down to bare essentials around a year ago. It feels insane to admit that I've been harming myself for over 6 years now, starting from when I was 12. I look at 12 year old around me and wonder how I was ever able to rationalise harming myself. I've been depressive since I was 9. Never had therapy for it. Never had someone who could whole-heartedly relate to what I've put myself through, but I'm not too upset about that. Cutting was never an escape for me. Maybe it started off that way, but it quickly became something of an addiction. It was added to my everyday life. From the ages of 12 to 15 I lived a life of : go to school, get home, cut, carry on. As much as I've cut myself in the past, my forearms are virtually scar free, and mind you, I wasn't just scratching myself up. Though anywhere else that I've cut apart from my forearms, are scarred. I used to draw my cuts into my sketchbooks, I still have those books. I used to draw bloodied razors and death. But I've never gotten to a point where I knew I absolutely didn't want to live to see the next day. And that makes me feel like I'm invalid in some way. Suicidal tendencies seem to be so cookie cutter these days, and anyone who isn't living in constant turmoil doesn't matter.

It takes me back to everything. \n\nFor those who are fresh into self-harm or even having the *slightest* thought: turn back. These little scratches can turn into cuts that turn into broken bones that turn into trips to the burn ward at the ER. Trust me. It\u2019s an addiction, and I think it should start being classified as so. While you are still in control, get some help. Tell someone, anyone that will listen and get you to a professional. \n\nFor those actively in the viscous night of self-harm with no intentions to ever see the light again: I sincerely hope that you find what you\u2019re looking for, because, I promise, self-harm isn\u2019t it. Once you sober up you can read the following. \n\nFor those who are working their ass off to get better: I salute you. I have been clean since last Christmas and it\u2019s the best thing I could have ever done for my mental and physical health. Relapses will happen, but remember that if you slip up once doesn\u2019t mean you have to fall back into that fatal lifestyle. Just because you mess up doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re back at square one, it just mean you\u2019ve only got a bit to go. The scars get easier to live with. I recommend dermablend; it is a waterproof makeup that is usually used to cover large birthmarks, but works just as well for scars. The texture of the scars may make it a bit tricky to cover up, but it helps a lot. When your ready, you can where them out in the open. The strange looks get easier to deal with. I used to swim in long shorts and long sleeves, and last week, for the first time in years, I wore a normal bathing suit to the pool!!! If you are ever emotionally able there is always laser treatment for scars, but I\u2019ll keep mine forever. It would be rather uncomfortable to see my skin look so smooth. Whatever works for you and your scars. Just remember that scars aren\u2019t ugly or freaky; they mean that you\u2019re so much better than you once were. \n\nTo all: lots of love. You all are going through some shit, I know. Pain is something certain and stable in your confusing, and uncertain world. That\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay that pain is all you can feel sometimes, but it\u2019s not okay to hurt yourself. This probably sounds like I\u2019m contradicting myself, but I\u2019m not: \n\nIt\u2019s completely okay to feel every feeling you have ever and will ever feel. No emotions are bad. It\u2019s the self-harm that needs to find a way into another outlet. \n\nRunning helped me a ton, as long as you have some form of self control. Because I\u2019m so unfit, running hurts, but is not hurting me. Same with taking freezing showers. Showers turned to the coldest temperatures got me through a lot. \n\nStay safe.

{"post_id": "c6b3sd", "created_utc": 1561669868, "title": "My story.", "author": "LimTheCat", "self_text": "Hello, I guess I'm not really here to tell a story but to get things off my chest more or less. I don't know an exact place to start this but ill start with the mental hospital. I came to my school counselor asking to be put on threat assessment and got exactly that. Later that afternoon some lady came to my house saying who knows what and next thing I know I'm in the ER and just waiting for some online psychiatrist to come in on a monitor and evaluate me. I already knew it didn't matter what I said and either way I was going in a mental hospital because thats what they do with self harmers. Eventually I'm put into a cop car and transported to Brynn Marr. The cop by the way was super cool and we talked for a while and he was into the same music as me and that was a relief having a good time before the bad stuff. When I got there some lady at the desk checked me in and took my shoes because no laces. I sit there waiting in a seperate lobby until they call me back to get evaluated. Blah blah blah evaluations over and I go to the boys west unit. Get introduced make some friends and overall having a nice time with the people. The environment however was horrible. The techs (the people who watch you all day) are assholes simple as that. Theres paint peeling off the wall making this place look like something out of a horror movie. Overall crappy days filled with horrible group sessions that dont work because you werent seperated into groups based on what you were there for so I was talking about my self harm with a bunch of people who were here on robbery offenses or whatever (I was the only self harmer there for the first few days). So then the trauma happens, My friend Nathan who was there for suicide attempts and substance abuse was in a pissy mood after the pills that they had him on were wearing off. A little bit about nathan before I tell the story, He's a big dude not in fat but muscle. He was super chill and funny and always knew when to make someone laugh and was trying his hardest to get out and escape his horrible family who put him there, ok back to the story. We were coming back from dinner and were going back to watch tv and get ready for bed. Me and nathan went to the second tv room to watch john wick together and just talk. About thirty minutes later this kid elisha came in and started calling us fags and whatever because me and him would act jokingly gay to eachother for some cheap laughs. Nathan tells him to back off and let us watch the movie, Elisha doesnt and procedes to poke at us. Nathan who like I said was crashing because of the pills and stood up and faster than a bolt of lightning knocks Elisha to the ground before I could even take in what happened Elisha's on the ground with a bloody nose. Nathan sits back down and continues watching chuckling under his breath. I ask him why and he apologized profusly and said that it was impulsive. Before I can respond a Tech walks in and see's elisha and freaks out asking who did it. Nathan stands up and admits to it calmly and passively. The tech screams into her walkie talkie for backup and a code blue or whatever. I snicker because she's overreacting and yells at everyone to go to bed and we do of course. Nathan seems to be getting more and more mad at her and starts explaining how horrible this place is and how his parents are taking money out of his own bank account to pay for him being here. The Techs just try and calm him down to no avail. He moves to the techs in front of my dorm room and I can see them arguing through the doorway. I realize that there were two outcomes that were going to happen right now if I didnt step in, one is he would get horse tranquilizer (we all called it \"booty juice\" because of where it would be injected) or he would make a run for it or hurt a Tech. So I step out of my room and try and talk to Nathan, the techs yell at me to back off and I might get hurt and I try and explain to them that I can talk to him and he agrees and asks to talk to me, they of course say no. After that there's a long moment of silence and all that happens is Nathan walks up to me, hugs me and says \"I'm sorry I didn't get to know you better man, see you in the afterlife\". I stand in the doorway shocked as he goes to the techs and says \"I'm sorry I don't want to hurt you guys please move\". In an instant he takes two steps back and like a bolt runs head first through the techs and barges through an iron locked door breaking it. (I forgot to mention they already gave him the \"booty juice\" and he was just powering through it with adrenaline, I didn't see it happen but I did hear him yell when it happened). Anyway he breaks out and that's all I know that happened at the time. I cried to sleep that night worrying about him. We get up the next morning and one of the cooler techs told us that he passed out across the street and they had to drag him in and that he was ok. This terryfied me and relieved me at the same time. That day I discharged and the last words he said to me were the ones from the night before. This surprisingly was the most traumatic event in my eyes despite worse things happening in my life none of them have touched my heart as much as this one.\n\nAnyway that's my story and is not very self harm related sorry but it's more or less what self harm brought to my life. Again this is not exactly a story just some things I'd like to get out. Thank you for listening.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

It\u2019s still going to be hard as it is, but they NEED to at least be healed. \n\nThe problem is that I compensated by moving to my thigh. And I added SEVERAL, and they\u2019re wide, and they\u2019re going to scar so badly. They won\u2019t be a problem on vacation but they will be a problem with my SO. She\u2019s supportive, always, but she\u2019s going to be saddened terribly. I\u2019m just nervous because I don\u2019t want to have to admit that I really have this problem again. \n\nI started in high school (7 years ago), but stopped after about a year. Recently some things happened all at once and I broke, and once that first one was out of the way, it was over. I don\u2019t think I need help, it\u2019s going to work it\u2019s way out of my system and lie dormant again like it used to, but right now it really is a problem. So it\u2019s good that I\u2019m admitting it but. It\u2019s hard. You all know that.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I can\u2019t cry in movies, I couldn\u2019t cry during my granddad\u2019s funeral, etc.\n\nIt\u2019s a bizarre sensation, it feels numb but at the same time, it tears me up from the inside. And if I let it fester, things really get ugly, and that\u2019s part of the reason why I self-harm.\n\nCrying is good for the body, it provides the emotional release, and I feel good afterwards, but I\u2019m just so numb and desensitized that I can\u2019t properly cry like a normal person would.\n\nTo counter this, on especially bad days, I go to the internet and look for despair-inducing content. I look at very sad, like soul-crushing images and artworks, I read bleak, hopeless stories, I watch heart-breaking videos, I listen to tear-jerker music on loop, and I wallow in my own self-pity and anguish until I can bring myself to cry.\n\nThis had become kind of an addiction, and I feel like the content I look for is bad for my health in general and can be traumatizing, but it\u2019s the only way I can get my emotional release.\n\nIf I have to describe it, it\u2019s like a twisted version of porn addiction, but I look at sad content and mentally beat myself up until I cry.\n\nSorry if this isn\u2019t MoS content but I need to get this out of my system.

Title relates to the third paragraph if that's all you care about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a 21 y/o male college student. I started cutting in February without knowing anything about self-harm or the ideas around it. I often feel worthless and extremely critical of my own actions/abilities which may or may not be why I cut. I've only cut myself deep when I've been drinking (terrible I know). I tell myself before I drink that I'm not going to cut, then I have one drink and decide that I'm going to cut and usually do. I've done 5 significant (imo) cuts on my forearm and 2 significant (imo) cuts on my thigh. The most recent being 2 weeks ago. I took a month long gap between cuts where I initially experienced a very strong drive to cut, but I was visiting family for the summer and know I wouldn't be able to explain new bandages. I had also thrown out my knives. Only one week after being back in my usual environment, I went out, bought knives, and cut myself twice in two days. I don't cut over veins, but the last one scared me a little bit and I threw out my blades again. I don't have any plans to ever cut again, but don't know how successful I'll be since I had planned to stop after the first five. I recently worked out pretty hard after months of little to nothing as a different way of hurting myself without blades. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm kinda just trying to figure out how to deal with the aftermath. If you pretend to give a thumbs up with you left hand, I have 5 vertical scars closely spaced on the top-middle part of my forearm. A very noticeable spot from almost any angle. I've thought about just showing the scars and seeing if people attribute them with self-harm or if I can spin it as some sort of accident with a metal rack of some kind. I think the scars scream self-inflicted and stand out, but I know their origin, so.....idk. I've been covering them with silicon patches designed to reduce scars, but I don't think it's working and keep getting bugged by people about what the patches are. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've come pretty close to telling both my friends and my dad (not my mother. I don't want to hurt her in that way.) that I have cut myself intentionally. Every time I think about it, I can't imagine starting the conversation or what their reactions might be. I can't shake the feeling that if I ever tell them, I am being selfish. I am creating potentially significant problems for them. I am making them worry about something that they have no control over. They don't cut me, I do. Now they might worry when I stay in my room or stay up late that I might be hurting myself. I'm certain they've never worried about that before. I'm creating new problems that will surely fundamentally change the way they look at me. I want to tell someone, but I can't see a situation where it is beneficial for anyone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm usually a lurker, but I needed to write this down and possibly get other opinions.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I'm 16, been in therapy since January, but both therapists I've had left to work in other places.\n\nMy mom set up an appointment with a psychologist, because my second therapist straight up told me she wasn't qualified to help with ongoing self harm. We came in a few days ago, for two hours, the psychologist was 20 minutes late, and wasn't focusing on the issue for most of the meeting. Eventually he asked my mom to leave.\n\nHe chatted with me for a bit, asked about my goals in counseling, I didn't know how to answer. He was expecting me to say I wanna stop cutting but I'm not ready to, I said so, he repeated it to my mom when she came back. She was angry/disappointed with me afterwards.\n\nHis actual advice? (Said to my mom) \"Oh she's not motivated to help herself, too bad, we can help you and your husband deal with it, give me a call in September when I come back from my holiday\". That's it.\n\nIt's hard not to get discouraged with seeking professional help when talking it out with therapists doesn't help and eventually you're just told that if you aren't ready to stop cutting completely, there's no help available for you. \n\nSo, thanks a lot man, I bet your professional approach has helped a lot of people get better at managing their shit /s", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

It lays out the PTSD, the anxiety, and depression. It shows some concern for mood disorder, but not enough to say I have bipolar disorder. \n\n About two years ago my doctor prescribed me lithium for bipolar disorder. I\u2019ve been reading a bit and it it says that for acute cases of bipolar you can prescribe up to 1800 mg, but for long term, chronic usage you shouldn\u2019t go about 1500. My doctor would check my blood and I was in therapeutic range whenever I was taking this, but also this was the only time I dissociated so bad that there\u2019s about 5-6 months of my life where I have little to no memory. \n\nI topped off at 2100 mg of lithium before telling my doctor I was uncomfortable at such a high dose. I didn\u2019t feel like it was helping, and when my therapist expressed shock at being at such a high dose she urged me to research and seek out a different option. She worked with me to the point where we recognized that I wasn\u2019t dealing with bipolar disorder or borderline or anything like that. I was having suicidal and self-injurious behaviors for a long time before that, but made even worse when on such a high dose (or really on lithium at all!!!) \n\nIs this malpractice? This doc just kept upping my meds until I begged him to take me off of lithium, and finally I went to a new doctor who weened my off all my meds, did actual screening, and began treating minimally the core of the problems. Turns out being on a low dose of a basic antidepressant works better than 2000+ mg of a mood stabilizer. \n\nI don\u2019t want to file malpractice, but I want to know if it\u2019s reasonable for me to be disappointed in this treatment. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m justified in being confused as to how it got so bad.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Man let me tell you something about my family. My uncle is a big piece of shit asshole like literally a walking talking asshole, oh yeah with muscles, but also a really big gut. Fat fuck, no fatshaming just fuck him. He threatens me and basically anyone in my family, mainly the boys, with a beat down if we ever start failing or getting \u201cout of line\u201d, so most of the boys are scared of him. I\u2019m not, but I know I couldn\u2019t beat him if I ever tried to fight back. Hell he\u2019d fucking kill me if I were to try. As much as I want to die I know I can\u2019t, my little brother is probably the most important thing in my life and I\u2019d give my life for him. One day he came to my house out of nowhere and started talking \u201cblah blah blah, your out of line with your mom, pick up your fucking grades.\u201d Just the typical your a disappointment talk. Anyways he takes my phone and rummages through it. Like it was fucking his. Mind you I have pictures of my, well idk what we are anymore, but I\u2019ll say ex-girlfriend to respect her wishes. Anyways, I\u2019m pretty sure you know what I mean by pictures. He starts acting fucking cynical like he\u2019s going to \u201cruin\u201d this girls life. How the actual fuck can you threaten to \u201cruin\u201d a 15 year old girls fucking life someone who hasn\u2019t even touched their sophomore year yet. What the actual fuck has to be wrong with you. Is depression not a real thing? Did I not ever cut before? Do you not see my scars? Oh wait so sorry forgot that depression isn\u2019t a real fucking thing in this family because we only have anger issues not \u201cI want to die\u201d issues. So you know that\u2019s a fucking joke to him he doesn\u2019t give a shit. So he leaves and I\u2019m crying trying to get out to my mom that I\u2019m depressed. Can\u2019t do it. Not tonight at least. So the next day I talk to my friend. Bless her soul and all the kids she may have and I really hope she is happy one day and that she truly loves where she is in life and is satisfied with what she does because she has helped me more than anyone I\u2019ve ever met in my life. I talk to her and she\u2019s helping me with everything she\u2019s helping me get through the conversation and get my feelings out without crying. She\u2019s convincing me not to kill myself and is helping me realize that I can\u2019t leave my brother behind. We can\u2019t call people Angels so we call them friends. She is a true friend. She talked to my counselor and they picked me out of class talk to me and yay I\u2019m on track to getting help with a therapist. I can\u2019t wait to start it because I deserve this help and I know I need to get better. I cut myself that morning though. I\u2019m glad the social workers didn\u2019t see it Bc I\u2019d be sent to the psych ward. Anyways I wouldn\u2019t be posting on here if there wasn\u2019t a good reason for it. I haven\u2019t seen a therapist yet. My mom isn\u2019t actively searching for help for me and I feel like she\u2019s given up already. I want to cut myself tonight. Well I am gonna cut myself tonight. I\u2019m sorry if you would\u2019ve wanted to stop me. It\u2019s been this last week. I don\u2019t know why. Well I do, but I\u2019m not ready to share quite yet.

I used a blade for the first time but it just didn\u2019t hurt enough.

I feel absolutely horrible. For the past few hours I've just been lying in bed going through mood swings of numbness, worthlessness, anger, and sadness. I want to cut, as that seems to be the only way to stop these feelings, but I know I should stop. I need to stop. I need to get better but I don't know if I can. I've been in this state for four fucking years and I just want it to be over. Every few weeks or months I tell myself that I'm going to force myself to try and get better but I can never actually get myself to do it. I just fall back into this horrible empty state where the only way I can feel anything besides emptiness or occasional sadness is by self harming. I'm so fucking worthless. A few months ago I took the major step of telling my friends how I feel, not my self harming but just how I feel. I'm starting to regret that decision. I either get too anxious to ask for their help, can't get the motivation to talk to anybody, or feel like they're going to start to think I'm way to clingy if I constantly come running to them for help. I'm just a burden to them. They can tell me I'm not all they want but it isn't going to change my opinion. I feel like they all have much better things to do than listen to my bitching that I'm being cruel to them by trying to initiate a conversation. Part of me even thinks they secretly hate me but feel bad for me so they stick around. Part of me knows that's not true and is horrible for me to even think they would do such a thing, as they are incredible people, but part of me doesn't. It's like I'm constantly fighting with myself. \n\nI don't know what to do. I want to cut as I know that will fix my feelings in the short term, but I also know that it will just lead to further issues in the long term. I just want to get better but I don't know how or don't know If I'm even a strong enough person to make it happen. I don't know who to turn to for help. I don't know anything. I just feel lost. I'm sorry to anyone who had to read this. It's probably horribly written and doesn't even make any sense. It's probably complete garbage.

Never asked for help, never really wanted it because I knew I can do it by myself. \n\nIt happened 3 days ago. He told them about depression, anxiety, stress, everything I was going through. He told them about self-harming. I was keeping this a secret for the last 7 years, and they never noticed, and I never showed it. I was pretending everything was fine and they both thought it was true. Until my boyfriend decided he will tell them literally every detail.\n\nWe've been together for little over a year now and there was one and only thing forbidden - this. I told him we are over in the moment he would tell my secret. And I love him, I really do, but I hate him to the bottom of my heart. He destroyed everything. My parents won't even speak to me, they just look at me like I'm a stranger or like I'm some broken doll. Worse, my mom put all the fault on me. In the past days my family became so disfunctional that I don't even feel like their daughter anymore. I am lost. I don't know if the best thing to do here is break up with him and go see a therapist (which I'm forced to) or something else. I can't look at him, I can't even talk to him, he broke my heart. It would be better if he had just broken up the relationship and left me. It just too much right now and I am confused and I don't know what to do with him or my parents or my life. It was already tense, and now it's hell.\n\nYeah I know he thought in his stupid, small-minded head that he's helping me, but telling my parents I cut myself broke my family apart, broke my heart and destroyed everything. My parents won't trust me and I cannot trust him. And I will never forgive him for destroying my life.\n\nP. S. : sorry for a long post, had to get it out", "subreddit": "selfharm"}
