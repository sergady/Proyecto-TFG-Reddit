If your clean streaks (and breaking them) are causing you massive stress, stop counting. \n\n\n\nI've been self harming on and off for about 17 years. The longest stretches I've gone without doing it happened by accident, and I can't put a start and end date on them.\n\nIn contrast, I know I've broken every \"clean streak\" I've tried to stick to, and the guilt and shame of breaking the streak puts me in a worse place than if it'd been a standard act of self harm.\n\nAdditionally, when I'm in a self-destructive episode, a pristine \"clean streak\" represents something else I can destroy, and it makes it even more tempting to give in to it. \n\nIt turns into a vicious, self-replicating cycle. \n\nIf any of this sounds familiar to you, you may want to take a step back and think about how your efforts to stop hurting yourself could be being sabotaged by stuff like this. See if you can stop counting, if you can just let it be. \n\nI relapsed today and I know it's been some months since the last time, but I feel very neutral about that, and it let's me actually focus on what I'm feeling now and why. \n\nI hope this helps someone!", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I had been having a particularly rough time before this and had resorted back to injuring during a panic attack, just a few shallow wounds. While I was in the hospital that started me on zoloft which didn't seem to change anything at all. Then suddenly another panic attack had me sitting there with over 20 new and a few pretty serious wounds. This has happened 5 times now (the panic attacks are common but usually not this frequent) Each attack I have now and even a few super stressful days at work have now left my legs covered in over 100 wounds.

I don't understand. Is it that I don't go deep enough? Is it that my legs have too much fat? Am I such a failure that I can't even self harm right? What is wrong with me?\n\nI allways have large open wounds on my leg now. I leave them be. They dont ever get infected. I don't think they will. I rubbed a rusty nail into one of them and it didn't even puss up. I stabbed the nail into it and it didn't even puss up. They don't hurt unless if I prod them. I'll walk around I'll put weight on them I'll jump on them and it's fine. they just sit there. Like open mouths. Laughing at me. At my failure.\n\nThey don't bleed enough. Even when I cut them they bearly bleed. They bearly hurt. It feels like nothing more than leaning against a sharp edge. This isn't the punishment I want. Is the punishment my own failure at achieving justice? Is my punishment being in this inhuman body? Is my punishment never being punished?\n\nI tried it on other parts of my body. It's never as satisfying. Across my chin. Across my forearm. It just... Opens up and swells, Like an insect bite. sure it bleeds but it's not a wound. It's a light scratch. I go over the cuts again and again but it doesn't go deeper. I try applying different amounts of pressure, slowing down or Speeding up but it's never more than a cat scratch. I've grown too used to the butter on my twigs I call legs.\n\nI tryed scratching but it ends up the same I scratch my skin off but I don't have the nails for it. so I just sit there like a meth-head or something scratching at the same spot for hours. Sure it burns. Sure it hurts continuously for the fortnight or so that the scab is there but it's over too quickly. Its not enough to replace cutting so it just neatly sits on top, letting me hurt more and more with my scabby scratched up arms and laughing legs.\n\nI'm pathetic. I'm a failure. I'm scared of being alone. But the problem is I was left alone long ago. The world spins round and round and round and round and round but I'm stuck. people change people leave me people die on me but I'm stuck. I don't spin with the world. \n\nThe words I said in the past still true in my head, repeating over and over like they're the reality of now:\n\n\u2022\"I'll love you forever\"-stopped being reality on Oct 13.\n\n\u2022\"It's just an exange student thing, of course I'll be fine\"-stopped being reality during May.\n\n\u2022\"I know I can trust you\"-stopped being reality in January.\n\n\u2022\"I'm planning on sticking here for the rest of my schooling\"-2018\n\n\u2022\"he'll make it through... Right?\"-2017\n\nAnd the same feelings and regrets still linger in my mind. Unless if I'm going to sleep with pills I'm transported back to two years ago, where I was unsure if I would wake up with a dead dad. Every time I open my phone, it's straight to his number. Every time I think of all the shit that I've gone through its \"don't worry, at least you still have the trip to look forward to\". But my dad died two years ago,  my ex hates me and I do not have an exchange to look forward to. I don't have anything to look forward to.\n\nI've held on for so long... Exept I haven't... I'm only a teenager why am I here, I still have a life ahead of me... Right? But when I look ahead, at what is in store for me, there is nothing. I'll amount to nothing. I will never get better my life is meaningless and I will allways be alone. So I've given up.\n\nI saw an announcement by Atlus. They said three days to go till a major announcement for persona 5 royal. Persona 5 picked me up back then, even if life had instantly beaten me back down. So I guess I have a date for it. Three more days. Three more days to go.\n\nGod I'm so tired.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I started cutting and having suicidal thoughts, attempts, and plans. Recently, around the last 2 months or so, I started \u201cacting out\u201d (not on purpose, it kind of just happened). My mom said if I kept acting out she would send me away to my dads house. After \u201cacting out\u201d a few times I eventually stopped and started doing way better. Everything was going fine until 2 days ago. Me and my best friend got drunk and we made out and gave each other hickeys. It\u2019s horrible. My mom found out we got drunk and decided to send me away to live with my dad. She bought a plane ticket FOR. THE. NEXT. DAY. Now I\u2019m gonna go to a totally different school in a totally different state. Idk what to do. Also, I obviously brought my blades with me in my luggage and on the way to the house he said that he would check my luggage and look for stuff. If he found anything I\u2019d be in really big trouble. I had my blades (about 30 of them), a rope, scissors, a vape ( that doesn\u2019t work), and a full bottle of pills. I almost had a panic attack but i just tried to play it cool. Once we got to the house he started to open my bag and I tried stalling but he kept opening it. I shuffled a few things around and acted as if there was nothing in there. Thankfully he bought it and left. Anyways the point is, idk what to do about my friend that gave me the hickey. I don\u2019t want to talk to him anymore. It\u2019s awkward. I think about it whenever I try to talk to him. It disgusts me. And if my dad sees the hickeys  or the blades I\u2019ll be dead.

Ive just been broken so much, over and over. I cant do this to myself, I have to have some control.\n\nI even want them to see the pain they've caused me, but I dont know if I want it like this. I just want to have something left of my will. This suffering has taken all of it away, but somehow it matters that I don't do what I'm thinking of doing.\n\nI think if I do I will hurt myself just as much as everyone else did. Maybe I deserve that. \n\nI dont know how to ask for help, I just know how to pretend like Im ok while I'm dying inside. I wish I knew how. I wish there was someone I could go to.

So I don't know, I don't know what I'm looking for here. Do the rest of you experience this? Body shame from all the scars? How do you deal? How do you explain that you're trying to get better? I just want to maybe find love one of these days, but I'm so afraid of showing people my skin. I know I'm better than these scars, but I don't know how to convey that. I'm not dangerous; I'd never hurt another person. But once people see my scars, they are inevitably afraid of me. It hurts. Alot. So I guess I'm asking, how do I rise past them? How do I stop feeling like I'm broken, and by association dangerous? I notice on this thread there seems to be more women than men; and honestly, it makes me feel even more nervous, like I really shouldn't be dealing with this. So any input from anyone would be greatly appreciated. I don't know if I can stop just yet; I'm in therapy, and I'm working on it. I'm just caught in this weird place where I don't want to lie, I just don't want people to be afraid of me anymore. Any advice? \n\nAnd let me just say, my beautiful brothers and sisters, that I love you and believe in you. Even if I am faced with this issue, know that I am truly rooting for you, and for those who have managed to rise above, I am truly rooting for you. Just hoping you can share a little bit of that mojo with me. I don't see scars, my family. I see victories. Little ones, big ones. You're still here, right? I just need help trying to figure out the proper balance between being honest and not being demonized. I don't want to lie to people, I just want to be judged for what's inside, not what mistakes I've carved in my skin.\n\nThanks for your time.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Neither have I been around people who are/have the previously mentioned actions/conditions. So if I come off as clueless, that may be why.**  \nwith that out of the way, here's the rest of the post   \n\n\nI made a post 22 days ago to this subreddit, [here's the link for that](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/dvd8d7/i_dont_selfharm_but_i_have_a_friend_that_does_and/) and this serves as a bit of a continuation of that. It's unbelievable how so much changed in such little time, it's been a lot of emotions very quickly and I've not done the best at processing them all. \n\nTo bring you up to speed, in a dramatic series of events, the school found out about her self-harming and a few days later, she tried to kill herself via Overdose. She's alive and in the hospital but I and several others were called down to explain the situation to the School\n\nDuring a section where I was speaking, I tried to explain why we never contacted school officials and believed we could help her via emotional support. I used her friend as an example. Naming her, and stating that she self-harmed recently even though the school thought she stopped. \n\nLater that day, I received a wave of furious texts from her, saying she's now going to therapy and her mother was in tears. She wanted names of who told the school and I figured lying was only going to make it worse, so I straight up told her it was me. She was understandably furious. She absolutely hated me and said I ruined everything for her. Claiming that I misrepresented her current condition and I fucked her over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing is... I can't disagree\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEveryone around me is telling me that she needed help anyways and she was a bitch so we should move on and focus on other things. But I mean, she was technically getting better. She stopped self-harming (*recently*), the scars were still fresh but she was moving on and feeling better. And I actively fucked that.   \nI keep wondering to myself that... if I never named her, she might have worked through her issues on her own and gotten better. And the more I think about it, the more I feel like an absolute shit-head.\n\nNow I am not this girl's biggest fan. I agree with everyone that she ***is*** a bitch who uses her issues as an excuse to be a dick. But... I understand that she *was* getting better and she didn't deserve to have her peaceful process of healing being crashed through by me.\n\nI don't want her to like me if anything I don't want to see her any more than I already do. The two of us have a rather heated history and I'd prefer a world where we didn't have to come into contact at all. But I can't get this idea out of my head that I'm a shit-person. I fucked up and wasn't thinking properly and now she's been forced into therapy and her secrets that she trusted me with have been leaked. She has a right to be furious and claims she's never going to forgive me. \n\nI feel like I fucked her over, and she didn't deserve that. I hate what I did and I'm not working through the guilt well at all... which is why I made a Reddit post  \n\n\n**TLDR**: I accidentally told the school about a girl who self-harmed. Now she's going to therapy against her will and she's incredibly furious at me, rightfully. I feel like a complete and utter dick for doing it to her and I'm not handling the guilt that well, and everyone around me keeps telling me to move on and she's a bitch anyway so stop caring.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

After this last time I know I really hurt her, I don\u2019t know how to describe the feeling but it hurt me really bad to see her cry like that. That experience combined with the knowledge that when she cuts it hurts me too, caused me to vow to quit. We made each other throw our all our cutting tools, along with sharp things (scissors, pocket knives, etc). She bought both of us packs of washable markers to combat the urge of cutting when we can\u2019t be there for each other. I\u2019m devoted to stopping this, and I think her emotions will be enough to keep me from relapsing, so hopefully I won\u2019t have to come back to this sub.

A person who does suspension and pulling told me that they were two completely different things and that I should separate them as much as possible in my mind but like... the reasons listed for why they are into those kinds of mods were really accurate to why I self-harm?

I had a tear on my face, and could feel myself ready to carve the word into my skin permanently. I felt a kind of numb that leaves you angry, or sometimes confused. I realized what I was doing and threw my razor back at my nightstand and ran.\n\nI could feel myself relapsing almost weeks before I actually did relapse. How can I prevent this?

The thing that is that is really fucked with my mental state seeing a family member react to a suicide because of home close I\u2019ve come to offing myself before. I feel bad for talking about how this kid\u2019s death is affecting *me* because obviously this isn\u2019t about me. But I need to just vent somewhere because the whole event has really fucked me up. \n\nMy sister couldn\u2019t even talk. My mom called her and she couldn\u2019t even formulate words. I\u2019m lucky I didn\u2019t have to see her reaction in person because I\u2019m sure it would be awful to see. The thing is that my mental health has been on a downward trend for a while now. I self harmed for the first time in over a year recently and the frequency of suicidal thoughts has begun to reach a worrying level. And I worry about what could happen if I get really bad and try to off myself again. What\u2019s going to happen to her? What about the rest of my family? I feel this guilt now for an act I haven\u2019t even done. I feel like there\u2019s a very high likelihood that it\u2019s an act I will one day do. I\u2019m ok now. Given the choice to not wake up after I go to sleep tonight, I think I would still choose to wake up. But where there was at first no question to how I would answer that there is now a hesitation. The allure of suicide is an ever growing force on my in my life. It\u2019s still small at the moment and nothing near how I was before but the fact that it is becoming more frequent fills me with guilt and fear. Odds are my death will be a suicide. I dont expect it now, or a month from now, or even within a year. But my mind has difficulty imagining any other way this could end. And if that\u2019s how it ends, what will I be doing to those around me?\n\nThis whole thing has forced me to relive some dark moments from my past. I can see all the times I tried to finish it. I can see myself shaking unable to bring the pills to my mouth. Or me desperately trying to work up the will to kick the chair. It\u2019s made me a lot more worried. I\u2019m going to hurt so many people if things go the way I expect them to in the long run. I mostly just wrote this for myself. Just to get some thoughts onto paper to calm me down.

I tried to sleep and all I can think of is my past mistakes, I can\u2019t get them out of my head and how much I messed my life up. How I got fired from my favourite job because I was to depressed to get up and go work even when I knew I loved it..I ended up SH my arm, I haven\u2019t in months and i\u2019m afraid to tell her that I did because I know she\u2019ll blame herself even though we hung out today and I had a lot of fun.

Her mom, more specifically. The dad's expression wasnt as easy to read.\n\nSee, Laura lived in the typical 'go to church every Sunday, bad things like racism and sex dont exist, pray before every meal' type of household. Whereas I, as a 5th grader, already knew that sex existed and that periods were a thing, watched South Park and Family guy, had divorced parents, bruises and cuts all over myself from abuse, and was dirty nearly all the time with unkempt hair due to neglect.\n\nYou would think that the stuff that they heard and saw in me would make them call CPS or something, or at least be more kind...but they werent. Maybe they were just so sheltered themselves that they had no idea that stuff can happen to a kid, I dont know.\n\nI remember one time at one of Lauras birthday parties it was Alice in Wonderland themed and there were these glass bottles of apple juice that said 'drink me' on them.

I guess I just needed somewhere I could post where other people might understand. \n\nI havent really cut alot - just some experimental stuff in middle school and highschool out of anger and curiosity. It wasnt until college that I really got addicted. I've always had some depressive tendencies, and alot of self esteem/image issues. Last year it got worse, and I went into a really dark place. I hated myself, I felt like a failure, and i used cutting as a crutch and something to root myself back into normal emotion. I also liked watching myself bleed. I cut on my legs primarily to hide it from my family and friends. I did my best to act normal, to most people I probably seemed happier than ever until I got home. (God, I'm really struggling to write this). \n\nMy (now) boyfriend was the reason I stopped. We were just friends at the time, but he reacted to my self harm in the literal best way possible. He didnt judge me or flip out, he made it clear he didnt want me to hurt myself but he was super supportive of me and wanted to help. He became the person i leaned on and needed, and still is. Before we started dating I gave him my knives, and didnt look back. I stopped going to my counselor (not a huge deal, i only saw her a couple times) and thought i was better. I felt better.\n\nFast forward a few months, I got on a birth control that - long story short - sucked in every possible way. I had bleeding so bad I became anemic, I had wild mood swings, and my depression came back with a vengeance. I felt awful about myself, I would cry all the time for no apparent reason. Basically it was just awful. I WANTED to cut really bad, but didnt. I got through it, I was fine. One of my coping mechanisms originally had been warm things - hot cups of tea to hold, lots of blankets and pillows, basically anything to make me feel warm and better. I still feel really guilty for feeling this way, but in a way my bf became my coping mechanism. I want to add - I love him very much. I'm not using him, but he helps with the urge to cut alot. \n\nHe moved for work, and will be back soon. But since hes been gone I've been really bad. Its textbook depression. I want to cut all the time. I think about it every day. I'm determined not to do it again, so I draw lines all over my legs with red pen. I told my bf about this, and felt SO guilty. He thought \"we had beat it\" and \"kicked it to the curb\". He is so supportive of me and tries to help, but I just feel like a disappointment and failure everytime I think about sh. Recently hes been asking me why I'm never engaged in our conversations, why I seem disinterested and like I never want to talk. But it's just SO damn hard feeling anything, and I dont know how to do that. \n\nHow do you deal with it? How have you stopped? Does the urge to cut ever go away?

I'm a senior in high school. I was having a lot of anxiety and I just needed some relief. I went to hurt myself in the school bathroom stall. But I went too far, I cut too deep. I didn't mean to. I felt better but then started panicing because I noticed the blood all over the floor. I also paniced because I haven't cut this deep in a long time. I tried to clean it up quickly but someone noticed the puddle and notified a staff member. The stall door was closed but somehow, someone noticed.\n\nI cleaned everything up as quickly as possible but the floor stained red. A teacher came in to check on me and the school police officer was right behind her. The police officer took me into his police car and drove me to the emergency room. I got a couple of stitches and was discharged a few hours later. I had to miss practice that day.\n\nI went back to school and everything was back to normal. I was still cutting during school and at home but I didn't go deep. But it happened again a month later.\n\nI had to leave class because of my severe anxiety. School was almost over but I couldn't wait any longer. I had to get some relief. I went into the bathroom (which was empty) and did it. And again I went too far and I didn't mean to. I instantly knew I made this mistake again and quickly put my arm over the toilet. I only spilled a little bit on the floor but not too much. I was trying to apply pressure but the blood still kept coming out. Again, I paniced because this rarely happens.\n\nI texted someone I trusted. My coach. I told him that I needed help. He knows I self harm because he knows I had to miss practice last time to get stitches at the emergency room. When I told him that I made the same mistake twice, he was disappointed and worried. He tried bandaging it up with first aid he had in his office. I tried to convince him to not tell anyone but he had to.\n\nHe took me to the school nurse. She put butterfly bandages on my wound and I was then taken to the emergency room. I got a couple of stitches by the coolest nurse ever. He was silly and made jokes. He tried to make me feel better during a really difficult time.\n\nI went to school the next day and had to talk with the counselor and principal. I was told that I was no longer welcomed. I wasn't expelled or suspended. I'm not no longer welcomed back. Although school can make me very anxious it is also the place where I have all of my friends. I love the sport I am in and I enjoy being around my friends, teachers, teammates, and my coaches. They wouldn't let me say goodbye anyone. To be shut out of school and the sport I love was just unbelievably hard to deal with.\n\nI contemplated suicide that night and told someone. I told them that I was thinking about it but would try to at least get through the night. That person called 911. Two police officers came to my home and took me to the hospital. I got a mental health evaluation. I was then taken to a mental health facility and stayed there for 10 days. Edit: The mental heath facility sent a note saying I was clear to go back to school but the principal would not allow me to come back.\n\nI was suppose to graduate this year in June but didn't because like I said, I was kicked out and I was failing my classes.\n\nToday I'm doing a bit better. I'm finishing my senior year at another high school. I'm almost finished with all of my classes!\n\nI'm still struggling but I really want to get better.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the support &lt;3 I didn't realize I wasn't the only one going through this. I hope my story serves as a warning for others to not do what I did and to REACH OUT FOR HELP. Things could've turned out so much worse for me. What I did was dangerous and although I was only hurting myself, it could've been seen as me being a danger to others. Although it was never my intention, what I did hurt the people around me.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

He's tried cutting himself, running his hand under very hot water, and holding something cold until it hurts. I've very proud of him for telling me. He wasn't exactly asking for help, just telling me. I struggled with self harm and suicide in my past when I was a teenager, and still sometimes struggle with my depression. We sat down and had a long talk and I told him all of this because I wanted him to know that I understand what it's like and I've been there.\n\nI asked him to tell me when he does and that he can always come and talk to me about it. I asked that maybe when he feels like self harming that he instead hangout with me. I told him we don't have to talk, he can simply sit with me, we can grab something to eat, go on a walk, get out of the house, anything he needs. He told me that he doesn't do it because he's upset or sad, he just wants to feel some pain.\n\nWe agreed not to tell our parents but I told him that if I ever feel he might harm himself in a more extreme way or put himself at risk, I would tell our Mom that he might need additional help. I went to therapy and it helped me out a lot sorting my feelings, finding alternatives, and having someone to just talk to. Our mom is incredibly understanding and would understand if he wanted to go to therapy, and I told him that it's always an option, even just to try.\n\nI'm asking for advice on how to help him. I plan on buying him a notebook so he can write down his feelings and vent without feeling judged. We also plan to go to the gym a few times a week in hopes that he can channel his pain in a different and healthier way. I also plan on helping him get out of the house more and maybe exploring some more hobbies. He loves photography and will be getting a camera for Christmas so hopefully that will help him relax and get out more.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions about how I can help him? Anything I can do? What has helped you guys? Again, I apologize if this post doesn't belong here, I'm just looking for any advice I can get.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

This summer, he got himself a girlfriend. Once he had gotten back to his dad's house for this school year, I started noticing some changes. First of all, he obviously missed his girlfriend, since they're trying a long distance relationship thing, but he's also gotten increasingly irritable. He'll get mad about any little thing that someone does. This seemed pretty normal given our age, but whenever something annoys him, he literally says, \"I'm gonna kill myself,\" or something like that. I figured that this was just ment to be him trying to be edgy, but now I'm not sure.\n\nThe big thing happened when he was hanging out with me and some our other friends this weekend, (which he never does since he spends most of his time at his home, talking to his girlfriend) when I looked at his hand and saw some cuts, that looked more like cat scratches. The wierd thing was that the scratches looked so perfect, like you couldn't see any sort of trailing where he would've pulled his hand away if a cat scratched him. Plus, there were a few of these patches of scratches, all looking the same, around his hand. It seemed like something was up, but since I don't really know how to approach the situation, I stayed quite. Later that day I saw \"FML\" scratched on his hand and I knew something was wrong.\n\nThen, my other friend noticed it and pointed it out to James. James just slid down his sleeve on his hoodie (which he wears all the time, which is another reason I thought he might be self harming before.) I guess that my other friend forgot about his question in the commotion of what was happening, because he didn't press further. Let me also add that this friend is a lot younger than the rest of us, and I doubt that he would suspect anything.\n\nNow I don't know what to do, I'm very close with James's dad and step mom, and they never seem to notice anything. I'm thinking about telling one of them, but I'm afraid of the outcome. I'm afraid that if he is suicidal, then telling his parents will just cause him to be pushed over the edge from embarresment, stress, or something else like that. I'm also afraid that, like most teenage relationships especially long distance ones, they'll break up and he'll kill himself. Since he makes \"jokes\" about cutting himself which turn out to be true, maybe the \"jokes\" about being suicidal are real too.\n\nHelp is greatly appreciated.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

She hasn't had the best upbringing with her mother being a single alcoholic that seems to have her own set of mental issues and I've always known she's hated living with her mother and I thought that was the main cause along with some substantial body image and personal confidence issues. I was praying that she would stop once she went off to uni because she didn't really do much when she was living with her mother, like she wouldn't ever do anything and didn't go and see any of her friends; so I thought that she might be able to sort through her problems in a new environment with new friends and a lot more socialising and she doesn't hate uni but she says she misses me a lot and she's a bit swarmed with her uni work and get's stressed out about it and apparently has no issue with the people she's living with.\n\nFrom speaking to her she seems to just overall hate herself in every aspect even though I think she's amazing and there's no shortage of me complimenting her and trying to get her to be more confident about herself but because she's a bit pudgy and she just seems to hate everything about herself it seems like she partly doesn't feel like she deserves to get better and that she's not really willing to accept that something's wrong with her current attitude. I mean she even told me that she almost didn't go to her first therapy session because she hopes she'll just get worse and kill herself. And while I don't think she'd go to those lengths as she's really expressed how much she wants us to live together and wouldn't kill herself as it would make the people around her sad if she left.\n\nI'm sorry if this is a bit disorganised I'm not really in the best of states myself and I don't know how to deal with this kind of thing effectively.

I'm a senior in high school. I was having a lot of anxiety and I just needed some relief. I went to hurt myself in the school bathroom stall. But I went too far, I cut too deep. I didn't mean to. I felt better but then started panicing because I noticed the blood all over the floor. I also paniced because I haven't cut this deep in a long time. I tried to clean it up quickly but someone noticed the puddle and notified a staff member. The stall door was closed but somehow, someone noticed.\n\nI cleaned everything up as quickly as possible but the floor stained red. A teacher came in to check on me and the school police officer was right behind her. The police officer took me into his police car and drove me to the emergency room. I got a couple of stitches and was discharged a few hours later. I had to miss practice that day.\n\nI went back to school and everything was back to normal. I was still cutting during school and at home but I didn't go deep. But it happened again a month later.\n\nI had to leave class because of my severe anxiety. School was almost over but I couldn't wait any longer. I had to get some relief. I went into the bathroom (which was empty) and did it. And again I went too far and I didn't mean to. I instantly knew I made this mistake again and quickly put my arm over the toilet. I only spilled a little bit on the floor but not too much. I was trying to apply pressure but the blood still kept coming out. Again, I paniced because this rarely happens.\n\nI texted someone I trusted. My coach. I told him that I needed help. He knows I self harm because he knows I had to miss practice last time to get stitches at the emergency room. When I told him that I made the same mistake twice, he was disappointed and worried. He tried bandaging it up with first aid he had in his office. I tried to convince him to not tell anyone but he had to.\n\nHe took me to the school nurse. She put butterfly bandages on my wound and I was then taken to the emergency room. I got a couple of stitches by the coolest nurse ever. He was silly and made jokes. He tried to make me feel better during a really difficult time.\n\nI went to school the next day and had to talk with the counselor and principal. I was told that I was no longer welcomed. I wasn't expelled or suspended. I'm not no longer welcomed back. Although school can make me very anxious it is also the place where I have all of my friends. I love the sport I am in and I enjoy being around my friends, teachers, teammates, and my coaches. They wouldn't let me say goodbye anyone. To be shut out of school and the sport I love was just unbelievably hard to deal with.\n\nI contemplated suicide that night and told someone. I told them that I was thinking about it but would try to at least get through the night. That person called 911. Two police officers came to my home and took me to the hospital. I got a mental health evaluation. I was then taken to a mental health facility and stayed there for 10 days. The mental heath facility sent a note saying I was clear to go back to school but the principal would not allow me to come back.\n\nI was suppose to graduate this year in June but didn't because like I said, I was kicked out and I was failing my classes.\n\nToday I'm doing a bit better. I'm finishing my senior year at another high school. I'm almost finished with all of my classes!\n\nI'm still struggling but I really want to get better.\n\nI hope my story serves as a warning for others to not do what I did and to REACH OUT FOR HELP. Things could've turned out so much worse for me. What I did was dangerous and although I was only hurting myself, it could've been seen as me being a potential danger to others.

So I just kept this fern for decoration but it started sprouting new leaves and growing huge and idk but it kinda gave me joy to know that I helped give this thing life and nurture it and it made me feel that if this little fern could grow so big and can be so strong that maybe I could do the same. I started getting excited to come home from school and see this little plant grow and eventually I went from cutting to just scratching and then I found the courage to go to counseling and after that scratching just turned to bruising but it eventually turned to just writing on my arm. And things were good after that. I still had to take anti depressants and I still have those thoughts sometimes yet I feel like I\u2019m getting further away from these thoughts.

(self harm TW) i had a dream last night where i cut my wrists on both hands, over the already faded scars from where i used to do it, and it was just so vivid and felt so real. even the blood soaking up the bandage and thinking about my friends reaction if she saw it. i don\u2019t even remember what happened, just that it did, and now it\u2019s been in my mind all day. i don\u2019t know if i can hold on. i don\u2019t even know the point of holding back. what\u2019s a few more scars next to countless others", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I just want to say that you all deserve to be happy and no one has to go through the pain alone. Please know that you are so much stronger than you know! I hope you will find new ways to cope \nI do not self harm, but someone I greatly care about does. Or used to, but she still thinks about it everyday. I need some help to understand self harm better to support her. I want to pull her out of this cycle. I understand that I can't fix it, but I can at least try to support her. \nI'd appreciate if you give me some answers to the questions that bother me. I apologize for errors, I am on my phone\n1. Is it possible to stop self harming and thinking about it permanently? If yes, how?!!\n2. How to distract yourself from doing it? I've read tons or articles about it. I just don't get how to focus on other things when you feel so bad that you are willing to hurt yourself\n3. I know a lot of people cut, but some people break their bones, starve, engage in exhausting and dangerous activities. What triggers one or the other way of self harm? As bad as it sounds, is it just a preference?\nI can imagine what kind of emotional pain people go through to get to the point that there is no other way to cope and release the tension but to physically punish themselves. \n4. How to support loved ones who self harm and not make it worse?\n5. What does it mean if you want the person who cares about you to physically hurt you? Is it a new level of emotional pain?\n\nIt is so scary to know that someone you love harms themselves. I feel that I failed because there is nothing I can do, even though it started long time ago. I want her to have a normal life without pain or at least release it in a healthier way. What if I am not strong enough to support her when she needs me the most??\nPlease help. Any suggestions will be very much appreciated.\n\nTLDR: how to support a loved one who self harms", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

But, what else takes a village? What about a college student? It can\u2019t be, though. After all, we\u2019re supposed to be adults. We take care of ourselves. We do our own laundry, we pay *some* of our bills, and we make our own appointments. We are independent, we are supposed to do it ourselves. Now, would this idea of our independence change if I told you something? What if I told you that one in five college students self harm, and for every one of those students, many, many more people are impacted. \n\nMy name is (it-takes-a-village), and I belong to the one in five. And, it takes a village, because I am not alone. In one way or another, my self harm has an effect on many people in my life. The people I live with. The people who care about me. Friends. Family. People I love. This is something that extends its claws out into the furthest corners of my life, spreading and changing shape until it has filled every little crack and crevasse and leaves no stone unturned. But, where does this start? \n\nI am not perfect. In fact, none of the five out of five are. But, what differentiates us? A coping mechanism that takes a life of its own? How does one scratch-bruise-burn turn into two, turn into three, turn into a self-destructive train that we\u2019ve hitched a ride on, that will keep on going until we\u2019ve hit the wall and are left to pick up the pieces, where ever they fall.  \n\nWhen I look at myself, all I see are lines. Lines on my heart, lines in my head, lines on my skin. There\u2019s one for every time I wish I did something differently. Two for every time that I am forced to reflect on where I am today. Groups of three-four-five for each argument, each mistake, every single time I thought that I should have been better. They spiderweb across my skin, reminding me of where I have been, and what I have done. But, they too, remind me of the guilt that I carry, that we carry. \n\nGuilt, guilt, guilt. \n\nThe guilt that I have for dragging people through the mud with me. The guilt that friends have, because they can separate themselves from your situation, but they know you can\u2019t separate yourself, because it\u2019s yours. The guilt that loved ones carry because they can\u2019t save you from yourself. It\u2019s the guilt that bubbles and spills itself over my legs, my arms, my hips; that stains my skin and my mind, unintentionally making me sink in deeper. I cannot separate my guilt from theirs, because inside of me, it twists and it turns, and hey, look! Now there is a *Raiders of the Lost Ark* sized boulder rolling through my life, ready to take anything and everything in its path\u2026 out. \n\nSomewhere within the spiderwebs are words that make me, me. Fail, and hope. Rise and fall. Bitch and beautiful, and hate and love. It\u2019s the good and the bad, the different parts of me. It\u2019s this dichotomy that pulls me left and right, and up and down, searching for only the black and white pieces to understand myself because I seem to be refusing the grey, and everything in between. I am seeking an unattainable clarity that will allow me to see myself for who I am.  \n\nWe need to see that maybe we are alright, but also that we are allowed to not be okay. That we are not broken, that we are not weak for doing what we do, because every single one of us is writing our own stories, and no two are the same. Experiences, emotions, and challenges intertwine with one another to make us into who we are, and everybody copes differently. We did not choose this. We may not be able to explain how we found ourselves here. But, hard as it may be, we will find our way out. \n\nUntil that day comes, I will fall into the support of those around me. I will listen as you tell me that I am strong enough. I will listen as you tell me that I am loved. I will listen as you tell me all of the little things that I refuse to believe because I think that I am not enough, all while you try your damnedest to convince me that I am. It\u2019s those close to me who remind me of why I stand here now. It is so, so easy to forget that what you do has an impact. And, this is not simply the intended consequence. This is the ripple effect that creates waves that people get caught in and swept over by. There\u2019s something in the sadness in the voice of your friends as they try to understand why. There\u2019s something in the look of shock that flashes across others\u2019 faces the first time they see marks on your skin. There\u2019s something in the way that these moments hit me, like a punch to the gut, because I know that I am hurting the people around me, yet I do nothing to stop it. Maybe this is selfish, but it is not easy. The second other people got pulled into my orbit of pain and confusion, this was no longer simply just my problem. It became all of ours. And, if I cannot stop for myself, that is who I will stop for. \n\nIt has been twelve days. Twelve days since I left behind the confines of glints of metal, and long sleeves, and long pants, and I know that one day I will truly walk away from all of this. I will wake up, skin no longer feeling like it\u2019s been torched by my tears and anger. The spiderwebs will stay. The words, they will remain too. The lines will fade. The guilt slowly disappears. Life will change, and slowly, this will pass. Yet, one more thing will last. People will come and people will go, but, once we were a village, and nothing can change that.\n\nWhy does it take a village? It is not because we are weak. It is not because we lack independence, and it is not because we are not good enough. It takes a village because we can\u2019t do it alone. It takes a village because we shouldn\u2019t have to do it alone. It takes a village because we are stronger together than we are on our own, and while we can\u2019t save each other, you can sure bet that we still need one another. Healing does not simply happen by yourself. \n\nI am one of the five, and I am not alone. \n\nIt takes a village, my village, and for that I am grateful. \n\n\\-----\n\n(now it's actually been 33 days :) wanted to post the original version, though)", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

These alternative strategies included placing my face in a sink of cold water(shock of cold water to skin), tearing paper, playing with slime or a stress toy, using elastic bands etc. The problem is that when I'm trying these alternatives theyre not going any further than an initial try out because I feel like these new alternatives do not exude enough \"pain\" for them to help me \"punish\" myself for daring to try and be remotely relaxed/happy -To confuse things slightly less, I have a major(more intense than most) phobia of loved ones being killed through graphic accidents and disease, and because it's not one of those things where you can ever reassure someone about, I feel like the only way I can cope with my emotions is to already be upset or sad so that if something catastrophic does happen , then my brain feels like I've emotionally prepared myself for the absolute worst case scenario. I also attempted to strangle myself last night, but apart from enduring a coughing fit, nothing else came from it . I know it hurts my parents significantly when I cut myself but I'm at a complete loss because to me that feels like the only way to control the way I feel-I really don't want to be sent to an impatient unit and would be very grateful if anyone has any realistic advice they could offer .", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

It started because of the people around me, I had nobody who loved me and my self esteem was dramatically low. The emotional pain I received made me cry most nights from ages 14 - 16.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remember it started with me cutting the back of my hair, where nobody could see it. It was my little secret, and I kept it in plastic container hidden under my drawers so my Mum couldn't find it. Then I started snapping pencils to scratch my skin. I'd punch myself too.\n\nBut the thing is, I was so terrified of drawing blood that I thought of a different method. I hated myself so much, (and wanted to die but couldn't bring myself physically do it myself) that I thought, \"What if I harmed through long-term? Then future me will be able to feel the pain.\"\n\nSo I starved myself, refused to look after myself, all the while telling nobody. It wasn't every day I didn't eat, only when I felt particularly upset was when I'd starve myself for days. After a while, things felt okay again and I thought I'd gotten over it.\n\nBut my patterns were always there. I cemented this behavior pattern of sabotaging my health and happiness. In 2018, I lost someone dear to me, (I was dumped) and I finally cracked. I couldn't eat, drink, basic human needs were impossible and slowly what I saw in the mirror started to look like it was leaking out of the mirror. It gave me a fear of mirrors since then, and it only happens when I refuse to look after myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I'm saying is, I'm now 18. 19 next year. All I do now is rot away in my room all day. I have late stage gum disease that I refuse to treat, and I have a skin discoloration that looks *a lot* like melanoma. It's been about 2 months and I haven't gotten it checked out. It's been giving me anxiety, but no matter how much I want to look after myself I just can't bring myself to do anything about it. It's like this force is holding me back from getting any help. I feel like past-me is getting what he wants. I'm slowly dying, I'm losing happiness but it's so cruel because I just want to move on. Why did I do this to myself?\n\nPlease don't end up like me. Please get help. You deserve more than this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, this is the first time I've ever admitted anything like this to anyone. I feel lost and scared. I'm sorry if this post was triggering in any way.

I did notice kinda recently that I still engage in other forms of self harm, such as skin picking, but I'm very proud of 3 years cut free!\nMy family and friends don't really know that I used to cut myself as I hide my scars from them, but about 1\u00bd years ago I found a new circle of friends completely separate from my \"old\" ones, and with those new people I used my chance to be completely myself and did not hide my scars from the beginning on. They just accepted me for who I am and I didn't get one stupid comment. It is a great feeling to be able to completely be myself with no fear of being judged. However, there still is one thing that annoys me, even though I can't say why. As I said, these new people are great and I'm so grateful to have them in my life, I get no negative comments about my scars whatsoever. On the contrary, they frequently tell me that they think I'm one of the strongest people they now, that they look up to me, that they admire the way I deal with my past. While that is a super awesome thing to hear at first, it kinda annoys me now, which probably sounds super stupid and arrogant. But I don't just want to be seen as strong and tough. I want to embrace my vulnerability and weakness. They see my scars and kind of assume that I completely overcame that part of my life and that I must be strong and secure now, but that is not the case. I still struggle a lot, just in less visible ways. While I'm typing this I realise how stupid I must sound, one would think that the best reaction to people seeing sh scars would be to admire the person's strength, but it kinda annoys me that they only see me 'that' way. I feel like my scars still kind of define me, and though it is in a way that might appear positive, I don't want it. Are there any other selfharmers out there who can relate to this??

I've cut far, *far* worse before, this was only a moderate sized cut just barely getting into the fat layer. I cleaned up, steri-stripped that bitch up beautifully, made a heavy outer gauze bandage taped to my leg to catch any excess 'leakage'. It was perfectly routine and I went to sleep a couple hours later with no worries.  \nAt about 6:30, I woke up just barely from a really heavy deep sleep, and kinda fluttered between waking up and falling back asleep for a while. In my cloud of fog i noticed that the whole left side of my sweatpants was warm and wet. I seriously thought \"What the hell, did I piss myself?? That's never happened before\". I was so tired I almost fell back asleep, but I patted my hand around on my pants to check out the situation a little bit. I can just barely tell by the faint glow of night lights that my hand has come up stained dark. Shitshitshitshitshitshitshit. I start to wake up more and realize this is something to take care of right now.  \nI'll spare you the gory details, but I was sleeping in an actual standing pool of blood, my pants completely saturated. I stood up and took off the pants and bandages, and while inspecting the mess I notice a foot or two away from me there's tiny, almost mist sized droplets of blood collecting on the ground like it's being airbrushed. It took a little bit for me to connect that with the mess on my left leg, I had to stick my hand in the stream and trace it, arcing all the way back to my leg.  \nSo clearly, my blood does not want to clot today. Currently I am sitting in front of the mess keeping pressure on the wound, waiting until my mom upstairs leaves for work before I get started on really cleaning up my bed and clothes and floor. I feel sick, and I can't tell if it's from blood loss or the realization that I could've died in my sleep. I'm guessing it's the former, as I don't think it's sunk in yet.

It talked, well, not really, but kinda? I mean, it's all in the same head so there are more forms of communication than just verbal ones, think thoughts etc. Anyhow, it wanted me to take my pocket knife from my table and, well, cut myself. I didn't want to comply, but the voice just became more insistent, and stronger. It wasn't until long that I picked up the knife, but then the struggle started: It was basically me vs the voice. I ended up throwing the knife away a few times, only to pick it up again, barely having control over myself. In the end the voice won and I, well, did end up cutting. After a bit more back and forth, a few more cuts, and more crying the voice eventually suddenly left....as quickly as it had appeared. Only thing left were the cuts on my wrist.\n\nI have to wonder now.....is this even considered self harm? Yes, my body was physically harming itself, but I wasn't in control of it.

This year we were off and on a handful of times but kept coming back together after a day or two or maybe a week, week and a half. In September she left me for three weeks. At the end of October, the 27th she left me for good.\n\nShe \u201cquite dislikes me\u201d now and doesn\u2019t want to hear from me for the rest of her life, and I\u2019m really struggling with going from talking to someone everyday for two and a half years, dating for almost as long, expecting to work through the issues somehow and spend the rest of our lives together, being best friends and partners in EVERYTHING, to just... nothing...\n\nI feel like a large part of me died...\n\nI had strangled myself with a belt a few times starting last December. I don\u2019t remember what happened that caused it, but it was a mixture of guilt and being upset from a fight we had had. I did again in June when we both physically hurt each other while we were arguing while drunk, again a week and a half after that after she did something to try and intentionally hurt me emotionally and psychologically, and then again a few weeks ago when we were already a few weeks into this most recent and last break up.\n\nThen this past Monday or Tuesday I cut for the first time.\n\nI bought razors from Meijer because I... I don\u2019t know. I had had a bad day with anxiety and I realize now I had depersonalized or disassociated from myself a whole lot. I tried to cut myself but realized very quickly I was not out of my own body enough to really cut myself. \n\nBut then I started seeing blood lines. \n\nI cut myself more times on that arm, then more times on the other arm in the same place. Fifteen cuts in total. They\u2019re small, about half an inch maybe, and not deep at all. Honestly they\u2019re just scratches that will be gone in a few weeks. But like... I fucking put a razor blade to my skin and fucking drew blood on purpose...\n\nI felt really bad after a few hours when I sort of came to. My ex cut a LOT when she was a teenager. And last October she relapsed, and I carry the blame for it because it happened as a result of a fight. I went to the hospital with her and she spent the night with me. I\u2019ve never been able to forgive myself for that...\n\nBut I know that if she knew I had done this that it\u2019s fuck her up badly... and I feel ashamed for that... but it felt good...\n\nI remember feeling calmer when I was done. I remember feeling satisfied with having this physical representation of the pain I\u2019m feeling inside of me showing on my body.\n\nI just wanted to get that off my chest. I haven\u2019t told anyone. Don\u2019t know if I will. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m going to end up doing it again... I told myself I wouldn\u2019t strangle myself anymore for her, and I especially don\u2019t want to cut myself anymore for her... but she wants nothing to do with me anymore... she doesn\u2019t want to go to counseling with me... she wants to go out separate ways... and it\u2019s honestly fucking me up so much... I haven\u2019t been able to imagine my life without her in over two years. She\u2019s always been there whenever I\u2019d think about the future, no matter how many years into the future it was, few or many. So... yeah... I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to me... I almost feel like I\u2019m living on borrowed time until my parents pass and I don\u2019t feel bad ending it all, because I can\u2019t go through this life without someone, and that someone was her... she was my person and I took her for granted and didn\u2019t do what needed to be done to make things better when I should have...\n\n\nThis turned into a long ramble I\u2019m sorry..", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

What\u2019s more is that I always had to internalize my emotions because whenever I did express any emotions I was told to calm down and stop acting crazy or hysterical/yelled at/the other person would victimize their self. Basically I was treated poorly but since I was taught to feel bad about everything I thought there was something wrong and evil about me and would cut myself to let out my bottled up anger and punish myself for being bad. I have \u201cquit\u201d self harm for months or so at a time but recently relapsed again.\n\nMy sister knows about my history with cutting myself, and I know my mom at least suspects it. And yet they are the two people in my life who continuously reinforce the same behaviours that make me cut myself. I just don\u2019t understand why they won\u2019t change or even apologize. No kid naturally wants to hurt themselves. If somebody hurts themselves they have been raised in such a hurtful environment that they could only try to feel better by taking out their pain on their own body. That\u2019s not normal. And it\u2019s not fair that I or any other child of a dysfunctional family has ever had to go through that.\n\nPeople who have loved ones who self harm should make it their first priority to try to create an environment where the person doesn\u2019t feel compelled to hurt themselves. You only get a brief spark of pleasure from being angry, hurtful, bullying, or manipulative towards people. They get a lifetime of hurt.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

But one of the biggest issues we have had so far is her cutting. I was aware of it before our marriage and thought I was better prepared to help her.

I believe it is from the stress of moving away from her family and half way across the country (California to Illinois). So she is reasonably stressed.\nBut when she relapses, she doesn't see the harm in it. (I don't want to paint her as the bad guy, I know she is hurting. And my learning curve to this has been far longer than it should have been.) She reasons that if she feels better afterwards then it can't be bad. \nI try to reason with her. I try to explain the scars, the emotional escapism, the possibility of cutting too deep (she doesn't think that will happen for her). She thinks it makes her feel better and I know it does. She constantly thinks about it in her anxiety and only when she does it, is she able to think about anything else. When I talk to her, the only reason she can list for not cutting is to keep me from being sad. How can I communicate that this is bad for her, with or without me? \nI'm on here because I think I am in the right but I need help explaining how (or if I am). Please help. I love her so much.

You may never be cured, but the black fog in your mind will clear and become lighter. You will be  able to think clearer and not be trapped in your mind with your dark thoughts. It will clear.", "subreddit": "MadeOfStyrofoam"}

Plus it increases the chances of infection so much that i was escorted to the emergency section of the hospital out of concern when i was done talking during group. it was too late for stitches, so they said i did a good job of closing it up with medical tape and keeping it clean (other than the cauterization).

Btw I don\u2019t think people posting pictures of their sh ir cutting deep is bad, is just that I wasn\u2019t careful browsing and I got really uncomfortable and nervious (idk if I should call it a trigger but boi do I hate the feeling)", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I'm really sorry if this isn't structured well but I'm not good with words or anything like it. But I need help... so Reddit please work your magic...\n\n**\\*Trigger warning\\*\\*Suicide\\*\\*Selfharm\\*\\*SexualAssault\\***\n\nI have been self-harming for 7 years, but as a child, I would hurt myself on purpose to deal with stress. So really I have done it my whole life. During my childhood, my parents spilled up (normal I know) but it hurt a lot. but since my dad left I had to go see him in a special center for a while, while I was there he would tell me about how he was going to take me away and how I was going to be free from my \"abusive mother\" (she wasn't at all abusive) this messed with my head so much. then when I was 8 or 9 I was able to see him at his house, now TW for people who are sensitive to sexual assault... when I would stay at the weekends he would touch me all over and take pictures of me in the nude. as a kid, I didn't understand. it was so confusing. After a few years of this happening he began to fight my mother for custody to keep me there, he started trying to get me to lie to social workers and random people that I hated my mum and I should live with him. luckily for some miracle, I stayed with my mum. this just made my dad angry and do not to me and hit me. I wouldn't say anything as I was so scared...\n\nso time went by and I was self-harming pretty bad and had cuts and scars everywhere getting ill all the time as I would get infections really easy and I would constantly be losing a lot of blood and not eating. but one day i was at my dad's and i wanted to go home because i wanted to see my dog. so i asked ... can i go home. my dad was extremely angry and hit me and screamed at me for hours telling me I was a disgrace and ugly and a whore. i rand home and cried so much.\n\nafter that cutting was on an all-time high. I was self-harming as a punishment and a reward. anything bad happed ,cut. anything good, cut. then in the summer the next year I attempted suicide 3 times. i got sent to a therapist at school who treated me like a child. so i gave up with everything. i stopped caring about my self and fell further down. my friends at school didn't help... I was changing for P.E and they saw my arms. the next day it was posted on snap chat. and i kept getting gripped and sleeves pulled up. then a week after that happed i tried again. i was almost success full.\n\nafter that I saw a real therapist, and it went well. then she had to leave and i got another therapist, she hated me, and treated me like a tv show character and kept making jokes(most likely a fail at making me feel better) she would also never make any appointments.\n\nI'm now 17, I've been working on not self-harming. but I've been so desperate to feel it again I have been biting chunks out of my tissue around my mouth. my arms look a lot better but all the chemical burns are visible. I honestly want to give up this hole not cutting thing. but i now have a long-distance boyfriend ( which is so hard to do ) he really helps me but he will always give the other person (if i m bitching or hurt by someone) the benefit of the doubt, which is noble but it's annoying as fuck.\n\nanyway the long and short of this post is I want to die, for real. I'm so sick of this shit. but the ironic thing is I'm so scared of the idea of dying. (how fucking funny) but i need some advice on how to talk to my boyfriend about this. I've told him most of the stuff like how i self-harm and when we met for the first time he saw it. but i lied about the molesting and my suicide attempts. I think he should know. but the problem is he won't tell me how he is feeling and it's so frustrating as i want to help him and know how he is thinking. Though recently he did tell me he was \"interested\" in suicide. i just don't know how to talk to him about it and or admit what happened or if i even should?\n\nso Reddit please give me advice. please?", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I hate the way I look and every time I see my body covered in scars in the mirror I'm repulsed and reminded how ugly I am.

I want to be able to wear a swimming costume again but I can't. I want to stop cutting, at least on my arms and calves (because if I stop now then my scars on my legs will heal and I'll be able to wear shorts in the summer I hope) because then I can finally stop being so self conscious about my arms and legs. But I know that I'll only heal if I stop, and I keep telling myself that but it doesn't stop me. I want to heal, and I want to stop cutting but I'm scared I never will stop. But I'm so disgusted by what I see whenever I undress and stand in front of a mirror, I wish I could just have a new, clean body and a fresh start. Even when im lying awake at night I run my hands up and down my arms and I feel the bumps of the scars and it's like Braille, telling me \"you're ugly\", \"you're worthless\", \"you'll never stop\", \"you'll never heal\" and \"you don't deserve to live\". I'm sick of it. I'm sick of forgetting what smooth, unscarred skin feels or looks like.

Having to hide my scars so my girlfriend doesn't threaten to tell a doctor if I ever do it again. Having to hide my scars so my parents don't see them because they'll never see me the same way again.

I haven\u2019t cut my arms in weeks but there\u2019s been fresh cuts on my legs every night since Wednesday because finals are really stressful.

And how I should add more scars to my arms.

I've never received help despite family and friends finding out. Its always been swept under the rug. In my teens it was depression based cutting. As a now adult (27), married and relatively happy, my self harm and subsided substantially, and for periods of time (some times years) has stopped completely. But I've been dealing with an increasingly growing anxiety problem, directly related to my retail job. And with that has come a a bad self harm habit. Context: I work for a smaller sized speciality grocery store. The job requires staff to do everything. Stocking shelves, helping customers find items, meal suggesting, helping seniors out with their bags and ringing customers through the till. But my boss doesn't think the job requires much overlap in staff, leaving us alone to deal with a store full of customers and still maintain stock. I often find myself completely overwhelmed and in constant 'fight or flight' mode. Since I am unable to do either I've taken to hitting myself and scratching my flesh. Leaving constant bruises and sores that dont heal because I keep scratching. \n\nMy husband is obviously aware of my self harm past and tendencies but the other day he asked about a bruise on my face (its not the first one) and I brushed it off as I always do. He then made a passing comment that really hurt me. \"You have bruises that look like Im grabbing and hitting you. You're self harming in ways that make me look bad.\" That just crushed me. \n\nI went to the walk in clinic to (for the first time ever) talk about my anxiety and depression. The doctor asked if I did drugs. (I dont) Told me to stop drinking caffine. Exercise. And go to another clinic that does 'drop in counseling' only 2 days a week. 1 of which is a day I always work. I wanted to shake him and explain that of course I should be taking care of myself better. But thats not always the choice I am able to make. \n\nThat visit was several months ago.\n\nI've yet to make it to that other clinic.\n\nBeing that my anxiety is so triggered by very specific things, I just suffer and then forget about it and avoid the problem. When I actually do have the time to go to the drop in counseling, thats the last thing I want to so with what little free time I have. I just wonder how much do I have to be suffering for someone to care about me enough to help me.. Despite all my years of self harm, suicide has never been the end goal but honestly, I can really start to see how a person could get to that point. I feel so lost and abandoned. I know I need help but the fact that people can live with knowing I hurt myself is crushing.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Ofc there's been things I sometimes forget are self harm, starving myself, digging my nails into my palm, biting into my lips, pushing myself when I'm in pain, biting my nails and picking at the skin, etc. But cutting always seemed worse and I'd been clean and proud I'd been able to deal with everything without resorting back to it. \n\nBut then I went borderline manic and fucked up a good bit and decided that I deserved to be punished and relapsed and now it seems the dam has been broken and the urge (which never died, really) has gotten stronger and I'm weaker and have been doing it, out of anger and pain and hurt and keeping myself grounded. The worst part is that no matter how much I do it- just superficial scratches, really- doesn't help, the urge is there. Thankfully, the place where I Absolutely Want To Do It is covered with tattoos, which is a good thing because I'm not going to damage the tattoos, but it's annoying that I can't do it there. Like yes I never did arms because it was so obvious but now, my life is absolutely so out of control and I feel awful, and I really don't care who finds out at this point, so arms (and legs) it is. \n\nI'm tired, my birthday is coming up and a side of me is wanting to acknowledge that I've fought for this long, but the other side knows I've been fighting this long and it's not use and why celebrate myself or acknowledge the passing of time because it's like I've failed. I'm sad and I'm tired and I just really want to give up- not even 100% a kms situation, just. If I've tried this hard and things are still bad, what's the point? My self destructive feelings are quite high, but to everyone's relief, I'm no longer manic and to their reasoning, less of a danger to myself. But, honestly, the mania kept me going because some of the stuff I was doing was fun but now? I'm just depressed. Too numb to really cry, though that might just be me repressing. Just watching bad things happen and sort of laughing and being like sure yeah that tracks. \n\nReally my life now is waking up late- due to meds, work- where I get yelled at and stressed under the responsibilities, therapy certain days, then I get home and pretend for my family, and then sleep and nightmares, and the we're right back at it. \n\nMinus the anxiety, I'm right about where I was when I was hospitalized a few months ago for my mental health. I'm really at a loss, don't want to go to my friends or family, I let them know I'm sad yes, but as far as this?

I feel so fucking stupid telling anyone, even my therapist, just how much I hurt myself because it's never enough. The scars were never enough. It never and still doesn't feel like enough to me, or as bad as other people i know. It went from light scratches that faded quickly to deeper and deeper cuts. Even now, i have purple scars all over my arm I still feel like its not deep enough. I showed my therapist my cuts for a second and she told me it's \"not that bad because they aren't raised\" ie I don't really have hypotrophic scars. I feel as though I may be seriously endangering myself as of late. Anorexia and ednos is something I've dealt with a lot and I as a result I am pretty thin to most. Not saying I'm super skinny i just don't have much fat on my wrist where i cut the most. I recently bought new single edged blades and decided to use it in the shower yesterday morning. Big mistake. I had been using a blade from this pack for about a month and had dulled + rusted the razor. I obviously opened the pack and pulled out a new one. I used to never wash or replace my blades, i would just use them until they wouldn't cut anymore, but I anticipated these to be deeper or as deep as my last ones. I soaked the new razor in isopropyl alcohol before and after I did the ol' slice n dice. I guess i wasn't used to how sharp it was and ended up cutting deeper than I think I've ever cut before in my life. Sure, i had cut deep on my thighs and leg before but I've never actually cut through the skin layer. When I looked at my forearm one of the cuts had gone into the subcutaneous fat layer, yellow bubbly stuff was exposed. I know this probably isn't that bad compared to others, and I'm pretty used to deeper cuts, but I'm pretty nervous. I really don't want an infection, because even though my parents know i self harm, it would be very embarrassing and i don't want to be hospitalized. I'm also, again, pretty thin in this area and i both really liked how the cut felt, and i hated it. I tried rinsing it out in the shower but it burned like a bitch. This was right before i had to get ready for school so I put sterile gauze and wrapped it with an ace bandage. Again, a big fucking mistake. The gauze stuck to the fatty tissue and all my other cuts as well and basically ripped off any sort of scab that had been there. Luckily my mom wasn't home and I was able to pour peroxide on it, apply neosporin + bandaids, and gauze + ace bandage it again. When I took the bandage off around 4 hours later, the cut was still bleeding and the edges were pretty gaping. It doesn't hurt nearly as much anymore and i don't think its still bleeding. Gonna clean it again when i get up and hopefully don't do something so stupid again. Just wondering if anyone else has ever had this kinda cut before and if I'm taking care of it properly? How do i prevent myself from accidentally cutting this deep, and convince myself i dislike it? It was really painful afterwords and I hate how this has become endearing to me.

I haven't in over a year with only one relapse and I'm finally genuinely happy. but I have so many repressed memories that are coming back to me. \n\nI started properly (cutting) when I was 8 but it's been like that since as long as I can remember. Im 15 now and it took a lot of hard work to stop, especially since I did it with no outside help and the first time I went to a school councilor was after I already quit.\n\n I don't know why I started but I think it was cause of my school and home life. at school I was isolated and while I had a good life with my mom my dad was a different story. my new boyfriend (hehehahhahshHhahagah sorry I'm big happy about that) asked me about my dad and all these memories that I repressed started coming back to me things like him hitting me, screaming at me, police, lawyers just all round a fucking mess and it's been hitting me in the feels. \nI like to keep things to my self and I've never really talked to anyone about how my dad treated me, I don't think anyone knows how bad it actually was but no one noticed so it couldn't have been that bad. but I haven't been able to get this one incident out of my head, my dad owned this internet cafe for a little while and while he was working there I would play on the pool table they had. he came up to me and told me to stop really nicely so I thought he wasn't that mad at me. so well I didnt stop and he took the stick from my hand kicked me down and started hitting it across my back.\n\nhonestly im over it but I've only recently matured alot and started to fully grasp the whole scale of things that ive been through wether that was the physical abuse that i was put through that I've only very recently admitted to myself and started to opening up to close friends and family or wether it was the mental strain I was put though when I was young. but as assholish as the guy was I forgive him. which sounds stupid but he can't help it since he's mentally unwell, which we knew but this year I got confirmation from his sister that he was diagnosed with severe bipolar and another disorder which I don't remember. \n\nso yeah shitty childhood typical daddy issues. i cant help it. and that would be fine if I was like a regular teen self harm story but I've been doing this since I was really young and I can't even deny it as much as I'd like to. I'm so confused as to why? like is it hormones or am I actually screwed in the head? why do I so badly want to hurt myself even when the rational part of me doesn't.\n\nI just can't help the need to feel pain. Along the years I've had different excuses as to why. when I was a kid it was that I thought it was interesting how nerves work (I was a nerd sue me) when I was in year 7 it was because I was super depressed and just generally suicidal (that's a whooole other issue)  in year 8 and 9 I used it as a sort of sick punishment game, like Id make tally notes it was really bad but hey I'm good now.\n\nalso the whole thing people say about grief coming after death SOOO WRONG. it comes at any time. I didn't let myself grieve for my grandmother until now and she died 6 months ago. i had to stay strong for my mom cause she was the only family we really had even though I never met her in person (ily Skype &lt;3) it was still a blow.\n\nso yeah I'm super depressed and super happy at the same time and I'm trying so hard not to relapse\n\nanyone out there self harming right now o feel ya and I hope it gets better", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

He just fucking died in his home from an aneurysm or something, he didn't have time to realize it before he was gone. Never did anything unhealthy either.\n\nSeing the coffin and seing peoples reactions was a feeling im not sure i can put in to words. A girl he was seeing played violin beautifully and the tears ran down her face while she struggled to continue playing. Seing his sister that is the same age as mine break down on her knees and hugging the coffin. His mom, my stepmom who i  have thought of in the past as evil, gave me one of those hugs that you really feel, and that don't let go. I can't imagine what she feels now, and i can't imagine what my sisters would feel if I killed myself.

Why do you have to be so needy and why do you feel like I care?\" and I know she says she cares but I'm constantly paranoid that she doesn't love me like she says she does.

I'm 20m and live with my boyfriend but I don't want him to know that I relapsed. Now my problem is I don't cut, I use my nails to scratch through my skin, which always ends up leaving wounds that sporadically bleed, have a lot of drainage, and are too big to use bandaids on (even the big bandaids in my first aid kit are too small). Twice I've tried dressing it with the gauze-like pads in my first-aid kit, but both times the drainage has soaked through the gauze within only a few hours and when I change it or take it off the healing cells get ripped off along with the gauze (which not only hurts like hell, it reopens the wound).\n\nWhen I was doing it I thought that the wound was small but I actually ended up making the biggest and most painful wound I've ever caused myself, and I'm scared it'll get infected if I leave it undressed. I've tried running water over the gauze before removing it after someone advised me to, but that just burned and didn't stop the cells from ripping off or stop any of the pain. I have petroleum jelly, but it's scented so I don't think it's safe to put on a wound. And the icing on the cake is that my boyfriend and I both got laid off and are job hunting, which means we don't have money for me to go to a doctor if it's infected and I don't have money to buy any expensive dressing or antibacterial ointment (we don't even have enough for rent right now technically, we're relying on our families for help but both of our families are dirt poor too).\n\nIs there any cheap dressing that won't stick or reopen the wound, and that I could hide under my jacket until it heals so my boyfriend won't notice? Should I just bite the bullet and try to use whatever money we have to go to doctor? I'm sitting on my bathroom floor with it undressed right now because I really don't know what to do. In the past I've never dressed my sh wounds but this one is bigger and is draining more than any other, to the point that leaving it undressed soaked my sleeves with drainage and I'm just worried that something will go wrong this time.

Every time I make any kind of progress with not self-harming they completely break it down. I hadn't self-harmed in a month and I relapsed today after a day of non-stop fighting with them. It was all too much. The morning started with them yelling about how useless I am. The afternoon was them screaming at each other so loud that I couldn't focus on my work, and when I told them to shut up (not the nicest thing to do on my part, but they were screaming and cursing so loud that I didn't know how else to grab their attention) I just got called a bitch. And tonight at dinner my grandmother was calling me useless and telling me how I'm terrible at everything and I got so overwhelmed that I just burst into tears at the dinner table. Yesterday was just as bad, me and my grandma got into an argument and she started referring to me as an \"it\", it felt so degrading that I just started crying then too and I didn't self-harm but I did destroy a lot of my belongings. This time was worse though, I'm never supposed to cry in front of them and for this very reason, everyone got so heated at the fact that I was crying and my mom started threatening to send me away with my dad's house and never see me again, and was calling me a buzzkill and talking about how I'm constantly ruining her day and life. I thought I was getting better at handling my family, but I'm not. I scratched my face, hit myself and cut myself multiple times tonight and spent a long time just laying there dissociating afterwards. They know I self-harm and I think they knew I was doing it then but none of them care enough to stop me. When I was much younger than I am now, I once threatened to stab myself after my grandmother told me to kill myself, and when I pulled out the knife no one seemed fazed whatsoever and my grandmother said \"If you're going to be that stupid, go ahead and do it\" and called me horrible, degrading names as I stood there with a knife in my hands. I didn't do anything life-threatening to myself that night but I do remember how hopelessly unimportant I felt in that moment, it really was the moment I realized they didn't care about me. One time I was crying and freaking out because of an argument between us, one where they were calling me their usual names like worthless, a failure, ect and while I was in my room I broke down and stated bashing my head against the wall over and over as a way to hurt myself and they heard me and no one was even concerned, they just complained about how loud I was being and otherwise ignored that I was even there. Living here is toxic for me. I've never felt so self-destructive than when I'm in this house. I think my life is going to be a constant cycle of try to recover and then relapse while living here, but I don't have anywhere else to go. I'm stuck here. I'm stuck here and there's nothing I can do about it. I don't know why I ever thought quitting self-harm would work for me. I don't want to look after myself anymore, I hate myself.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

My friends knew about it so I didn\u2019t really hide my scars around them unless I knew it was triggering for them. So for the most part my reason for hiding them was either (1) I didn\u2019t want to get caught, or (2) I don\u2019t want my friends to feel uncomfortable or get triggered.\n\nWhen my family finally discovered I was cutting, I stopped carrying about whether or not my scars are visible.\n\nI think the lack of caring draws a lot from the fact that one of my parents never actually took it that seriously at the beginning (i.e., believing excuses like \u201cI scratch myself too hard\u201d).  And because I originally started doing it as a cry for attention. I ran out of ideas and got desperate and figured self-harming would be a way to get my parents to finally believe me when I tell them my mental health was in a shitty place and I needed to meet with a psychiatrist.\n\n(Spoiler alert! It wasn\u2019t effective. I knew it was stupid but I did it anyway and it still took over three years plus \u201caccidentally\u201d exposing myself and my fresh cut to a medical professional in my university\u2019s clinic before I was taken somewhat more seriously.)\n\nThe thing I\u2019m most insecure about with regards to my scars is how bad my scars look like.

But to say my life has been pretty horrible lately is putting things mildly. I\u2019ve started drinking alone, I still live with my parents so I go out, buy something strong and sneak it into my room.\n\nThat night I drank an entire bottle of wine a couple of beers and I stole something with 35% from my parents. I had never stolen alcohol from them before, but I was so desperate not to feel like absolute shit that I didn\u2019t care. It wasn\u2019t until that last drink that I finally felt good, until I remembered my dead dog. I loved that dog so much and never got to properly process her passing, so I started bawling my eyes out. Which lead to me thinking about all the horrible shit that has been haunting me for so long now. I went from being okay-ish, to awful to just\u2026 numb. I remember sitting in my chair, looking at my screen but not really taking anything in, just thinking about anything and everything when suddenly a single thought jumps to the front of my brain. \u2018\u2019I want to cut myself\u2019\u2019. It was so weird, I\u2019d never done it before or anything, but I\u2019d read online and heard from others who used to cut themselves why they did it. And what it did to them. I just wanted something to pull me to the physical world I think. So in a sort of trance I left my room, walked past my parents\u2019 bedroom and down the stairs. My brother was still gaming in his room downstairs, which is next to our kitchen. I remember just grabbing a knife and starting to cut my own arm, just below my elbow. It just wouldn\u2019t cut through my skin, so I grabbed another with more ridges and after a few attempts I finally drew blood. If at anytime during this my brother decided to go grab something to drink or something like that, he would\u2019ve walked in on me doing this. But he didn\u2019t. And I just stood there, staring at what I had just done still in a daze. I cleaned the knifes and put them away and walked back to my room, just feeling empty.\n\nThe next day I just couldn\u2019t help but stare at the wound. My eyes kept glancing at it. And I felt so empty, I knew it was wrong and sick and it didn\u2019t help at all. At that point I wasn\u2019t sure why I had done it at all. So I patched it up and headed out, as I had some plans that afternoon. But as I walked through the train station a sudden feeling of happiness overcame me. I had my sleeves rolled up (I get hot really easily) and the big, white bandage that covered my wound was on display. People probably didn\u2019t notice it at all, but still. I felt as if finally I had proof that there was something wrong with me. That now that I had a physical symptom there was no denying that I was messed up and needed help. I felt almost euphoric. \n\nNow that a couple of days have passed I don\u2019t know what to feel. I\u2019m not as worried about it as I should be. Sometimes I really want to tell my friends, hoping that they would do something to stop me from doing it again. I know it\u2019s wrong, but I can\u2019t help but just feel nothing. I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m in a \u2018\u2019cooldown period\u2019\u2019 right now and that after a few days or weeks I\u2019ll get the urge again and I\u2019ll do it again. I don\u2019t know what to do. I feel like I need to tell my friends but I don\u2019t want to burden them with it, I should go to therapy but what if I\u2019m just overexaggerating? My life has gotten so messed up and nobody knows because I\u2019m too good at acting like everything is okay. I don\u2019t know what\u2019ll happen to me if things keep going like this and I don\u2019t think I want to find out.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for the long post, this is the first time I properly put everything into words.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Being around him gives me so much anxiety. On top of that, I\u2019m going to residential treatment for anorexia in about a week and have been anxious about missing school to be there. Today my brother and I were Christmas shopping at the mall and I started to get overwhelmed. There were so many people and sounds and I felt trapped. We went outside and sat in the rain while we waited for our parents to pick us up. I was crying but not much because I didn\u2019t want anyone to stop and ask if I was okay.

I felt the weight of everything that had been going on hit me. After driving for a bit, my dad pulled over so my mom could calm me down. I was curled into a ball, hyperventilating, and crying. My intrusive thoughts were getting so loud. The image of me stabbing myself in the thigh had been circulating in my head since I had started to cry. My mother sat next to me and ran her fingers through my hair while I cried. Eventually I calmed down. I\u2019m at home now and I feel like everything is pointless. I know my parents will never truly accept for who I am. (I\u2019m a lesbian and they\u2019re homophobic Christians) I feel like such a disappointment to them.

I'll admit, i didn't stay strong, i relapsed. Bad. I still have the scars and they haven't faded much. I just remember getting a text from someone saying they're now with my boyfriend, and that he's much happier. I know it sounds stupid, but we were together for a year and i always worried about being left randomly, and then it happened. And for my best friend, to make matters worse. I grabbed my favorite sharp thing, went into the bathroom, and just lost it. Hysterically laughing and crying, bleeding all over the place. Silently crying and whispering profanities as i mutilated myself. It was one of the worst christmases, i remember laying in bed that night, and the excruciating pain of the cuts all over my body, as i tried to find a position that didn't feel like i was dying. Over time my focus shifted from the empty, lonely feeling, to feeling like i had absolutely no purpose on this planet. My parents were mad at me because i just came out as bisexual, and i felt like there wasn't a person on this earth that loved me, or would care if i killed myself. This went on until February, every day the desire to kill myself getting stronger, and my self preservation getting weaker. I was barely making it through those days, i had nobody who genuinely cared, just people saying shit like \"have you tried meditating?\" Or \"it's all in your head just be happy\" i was cutting nearly every day, each time a little deeper. Until one day i couldn't take it anymore and i told my therapist. She immediately hospitalized me, which was awful for a number of reasons. One, my mother has lost several family members to suicide, and two, mental hospitals fucking suck. It was 5 days of hell. My family was worried and angry and confused, my friends didn't even care. It was incredibly lonely and vulnerable. Every 20 minutes someone pulling you aside to have you tell them your life story. It was so draining, i thought as soon as i get out of here, in gonna finaly do it. Im going to kill myself. But when the day came that i was to be discharged, i didn't feel like dying. I felt hopeful for the first time in months, i was nervous, but i just couldn't wait to get home. I missed my bed, and my cats and not having to ask every time i needed to piss. I was almost happy, walking out of that terrible place, my bag of clothes in one hand and i giant stack of papers in the other. I checked my phone and i had zero messages, nobody had even noticed i was gone. The feeling came back, but at least the meds were helping a bit. Fast forward a year and im now in a fantastic relationship, my mom fully accepts who i am, and i feel alive again. I don't know exactly what changed, but through hours of therapy, lots of meds that made my head foggy for a while, and sitting in the lap of my significant other while i talked and crying and laughed. What im trying to say is, it gets better. And i know EVERYONE will tell you that, and you'll think it's bullshit, but im telling you as a survivor of self harm and suicide attempts, it really does get better. It may take what seems like forever, but trust me, you will be happy again. I promise. Dm me if you ever need to talk, and sorry for the ridiculously long post, it's 1:00 am and i can't sleep.

I used to just blame my misery on externals. My grandma is too controlling. My school is not being accommodating. My grades are high and that is stressful. It is the semester break now though, and I no longer have anything to blame to for my misery. The source is apparent, and it is the one thing I cannot escape -me.

This all happened over a week period. So I (17f) met this girl (also 17f) on some discord server I'm in and we started talking, and we ended up getting along super well. Like, really really well, I really enjoyed talking to her and apparently she did to me.\n\nVery soon after she learned I was bi she became super flirty and stuff with me, and I kinda went along with it cause I was feeling pretty lonely and i mean hey who doesn't like feeling a little bit special and liked sometimes. Out of the blue she sent some very sexual pictures to me, and didn't even ask for any back, told me to just \"enjoy\" them. \n\nSo like I was getting kinda excited because someone seemed to like actually like me a lot. I ended up telling her about my self harm (it came up in conversation), and if fucking hurts so much because she was the first person I'd fully told about it, and she genuinely seemed to care. She said she didn't want me to do it anymore and I could always talk to her (which sounds simple and whatever but no one has ever fucking told me that before). I was so happy hearing that and I really couldn't believe there was someone in my life who seemed to care so much and consistently make me happy. But I guess it really was too good to be true :')\n\nShe sent nudes 1 other time, out of the blue again, and again told me I didn't need to send anything back, she just wanted to \"make me feel good\". They looked extremely similar to the first ones but there were small differences in the bodies which made me panic and wonder if it was the same person. This was literally the first time I even considered that anything was wrong (I know, that's my fault and I'm an idiot), and even looking back through the chat I can't even find anything suspicious. But I decided to reverse image search the pics, \"just to make sure\", and up came imgur links from 2017 lmao. \n\nI was hurt so much by that, I felt fucking pathetic for falling for it, and hurt beyond belief that this person who could consistently make me smile and seemed to genuinely care about me wasn't real. I messaged the person asking them to tell me if they were fake and sent the tineye results and got a \"I'm sorry\" in return. Apparently I was talking to a 20 something guy who's only explanation as to why he was doing this was \"I'm a bad person\".. LIKE WHAT THE FUCK. I don't even get why he did it, what his motives were. I never sent a single sexual pic and he never asked for one. I thought we both just got along really well and was happy to have someone like that in my life. But of course that wasn't true. I don't deserve anything like that. The one fucking time I open up and it gets thrown back in my face by some person who plays with people's emotions just for fun. I want to hurt myself more than I even have right now, I want to fuck up my legs till they're covered in blood and cuts and it hurts to walk, just as punishment for being so fucking gullible and stupid, and for even getting this worked up over this. I get the feeling I'm just gonna be even more insecure about opening up in the future and even more scared to get close to people, as right now I have a 5 to 0 track record for close friendships going wrong.\n\nIdk, sorry for the rant and bad formatting and stuff, just wanted to tell someone and I feel too stupid and scared to tell my friends.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

So as we were talking I brought up if short sleeves were okay around his family. he said no which is completely fine, I don't even wear short sleeves around my own family. but then he sent a message after he had gone quiet. saying and I quote \"I'm sorry is it bad I'm still, not comfortable seeing your arms\" (he typed as he gets really nervous and doesn't like to say things out loud ) I said yes I will around your family. and went on to say we don't see each other that often so I understand, it's hard to see that. (still quiet) I then decided that I would be strong and say I honestly don't care what you think if I'm wearing a short-sleeved shit when you come over and if its summer. I want to be like everyone else and wear a short-sleeved shit if I want. I'm not going through another summer where I have to worry about old scars that show I got over the hardest part of my life.\n\nthen he was still quiet. I panicked and said sorry then he said Idk what to say. so then after me trying to get him to talk he left. and then I cried and sent him a bunch of apologetic messages saying, I'm so sorry, I shouldn't have said that, ill wears long sleeves if it makes it easier, etc.\n\nso now I feel like shit and I don't know what to do. I'm just crying thinking about how much of a shitty person I am for doing this to my self. Yet at the same time, I just want to cut and burn myself as a punishment for doing this.

If this doesn't work I'm seriously considering having myself committed. Its either that  or  suicide, and I promised myself I  wouldn't make my parents bury their child. \n\nBut I asked around and eventually... one of my coworkers will be selling me some shrooms tomorrow! I'm really looking forward to maybe this working and maybe being okay for once; I'm genuinely feeling really optimistic about this. \n\nI'm even cleaning my living space tonight to make sure I have the best possible trip in a comfortable area, and I even talked to my roommate about giving her a (taped up) box of 'stuff that gives me bad vibes'. I haven't explicitly told her I cut, so I hope she believes it'll be full of old love letters and not razors. \n\nBut... I kind of feel like tonight is my last chance to cut. If the shrooms actually help I won't need to do this anymore. And I feel the need to make it a GOOD session too, nice and deep for at least one good memorable scar. And maybe I can use up some of the supplies in my kit so that the taped up box I hand my roomie is a lot emptier than it should be, or is now. \n\nBut.. I haven't worked up *quite* enough self hatred for another session tonight. I cut just last night and I'm not sure if I'm disgusted by myself enough to do it again tonight. \n\nSo... should I have one lovely self indulgent session tonight and get it all out of my system, or should I trust that I'll feel completely different about all of this tomorrow?\n\nI'd really value your input, guys.

I don't know where else to post this. And I don't want to pester anyone with my problems, especially today.\nI have never been to therapy and I'm not diagnosed.\n\nI've always struggled with my body image and had some depressed episodes when I was around 12. I tried to throw up my meals and started cutting at that time. We then talked about mental health at school and how people cut for attention, how some are not really ill etc, I immediately felt guilty and told myself I was one of them. And somehow that's true I guess. When my grandma died I cut on my hips for the last time, I promised to never cut again.\nI've been clean since then, around 5 or 6 years. \n\nNever had a lot of friends. Everyone just kinda left, we lost touch because of different interests.\nI became really depressed when I finished school cause no one cared about me.\nI gained a lot of weight and began to starve myself, excersise and eventually throw up again. I took a gap year in Australia. There I continued to starve myself and I'm still having issues with food to this day. I didn't socialize with many people abroad like you might see other backpackers do. Had the best time there but I'm not talking to anyone who I met there anymore. Mid-trip I met a guy who I thought was someone who'd stay. It felt like we were soulmates. He visited me last year. When he left I skipped uni for a while because I missed him so much. I wanted him to have a good time and not annoy him while travelling so we didn't text a lot. Christmas came around, he told me he missed me. I remember writing in my new journal about it as a fresh start so it can only be filled with happy memories. \nLater I found pictures of him with a girl. Tried to find a solid excuse cause he seemed like a genuine guy. I broke down completly. We only exchanged a few texts over the months. I didn't dare to ask him anything about the girl or tell him how I was feeling and how it's affecting me. I was scared of losing him. That he'd just ignore me when all I wanted was an explanation. I just pretended everything was fine again. Eventually he stopped texting me. I think he was my first love.\n\nFeeling better, I went to London in summer and met someone there. I didn't want anything to come off of it but I have visited him there twice since then. We both kinda like each other but we talked about it and know that it's not gonna work out. We're still talking though.\nI don't know what's wrong with me. I don't want him to leave but I also don't want a serious relationship with him. We talk daily now, whenever he's not texting me I'm feel insecure and like he's lost interest. It's painful. \nI'm afraid he'll throw me away just like the last guy I trusted that much. I don't want to lose him. Some days he's the only one who I talk to. I dont want this to go away. I don't want this to fall apart because I don't know what to say.\nIt was my birthday a few weeks ago. Only a handful of people remembered. I'm used to it but it still hurt like hell. I broke my promise then and started cutting again. \nI like being alone, I dont wanna be around people all the time but I want someone to care about me. Someone I can rely on who isn't gonna leave. \nNow I feel lonelier that ever, I cut every other day. I really like my scars. I want him to notice and tell me everything's gonna be fine. I want my friends to ask how i'm doing. I want the guy who shattered my heart to know what he's done to me. And him to explain what was going on. I thought I was over him but a very tiny part of me probably still hopes he feels something for me even though I would never want to be with him again.\nIt's been a year now, I apparently still think about him although he's with that other girl now and I can't help but think I'm cursed, meet a nice guy every other year, get attached only for him to find someone better around christmas.\n\nThis is all over the place and got really long, thanks for reading this far if you're still with me.

I am simply noting my experience with it as it relates to someone else important to me.\n\nI would describe myself as a confident outgoing person. I would like to think of myself as being well liked among my peers and have been described by others as being quite handsome. I play both football and baseball at my high school so I have a pretty large social circle and do pretty well academically (honour roll). Before you accuse me of simply bragging, I feel this background provides some important context for what I'm going to say next.\n\nAbout two months ago, I got paired up with a girl for an AP English assignment. English is one of my weaker subjects and this girl had a reputation for being a strong English student. She was quiet and seemed plain. To be honest, I had never really noticed her before and didn't have much of an opinion of her. She always wore grey hoodies and jeans to school and generally kept to herself. Nice, but plain would be an apposite summation of her. Initially, she seemed shy around me, which was understandable. I did my best to make her feel comfortable around me, but she seemed shy.\n\nOne day, I dropped my pencil case when we were working on this assignment together. It fell in the ground close to her so she leaned down to pick it up. Her sleeve caught on her chair and got bunched up, revealing extensive scarring that I recognised immediately. She quickly covered it up but she knew I saw.\n\nPrior to this, I she hadn't really left much of an impression on me, but seeing those scars, knowing what they meant she had been through, it made me realise there was much more to her than initially meets the eye. I thought she was this plain Jane type girl but in reality she had all these complex thoughts and problems that made her a much more interesting person and I never would have noticed had it not been for those scars.\n\nSince it was the elephant in the room, the topic was brought up the next time we met. One thing let to another and a short while after, we started dating. She was introduced to my circle of friends and has since become much more social and outgoing, even making a few friends of her own!\n\nAll this because I happened to notice her scars one day", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I have depression/anxiety but have always said I don\u2019t have PTSD or any symptoms when any medical people have asked about it. \n\nWhile I was gone training for 6 months in 2018 my wife developed a serious drinking habit, and has struggled with it really hard until 2 months ago when she was finally able to quit for more than 2-3 days at a time.\n\nThis whole year long period after I came home from the 6 months of training was hell. After I had the failed surgery I was in a lot of pain, and she was still drinking almost every day. The issue with her drinking is even though does it at home and at night, she gets very violent and blacks out every single time. I have videos of her being crazy while drunk, trying to hit me and doing crazy violent shit. \n\nWell after a while she developed a pattern of going to Walmart at like 8-9 pm and getting a bottle. She would always swear up and down she wasn\u2019t going to get alcohol but would always come home with one and I\u2019d get super stressed out the whole time she was gone, just hoping for her to not come back with any alcohol. \n\nIt\u2019s been 2 months since she stopped drinking, and every time she try\u2019s to leave the house after it gets to be 8-9pm I get so stressed out and just kinda freak out until she gets back. She kept swearing that she would never just bring home alcohol again, but I just cant help but to get really angry and stressed and just really aware of how long she has been gone, if she\u2019s bringing in bags I\u2019m like ok where\u2019s the bottle? But I have tried to keep all this to myself and give her a chance to go out and not get alcohol and for the last two months she hasn\u2019t.\n\nLike 4 days ago she left again and I was stressing out and when she came home she had a bottle and was talking shit about how she is an adult and will drink if she wants to and I just lost it I started freaking out and just begging her to get rid of the alcohol and I felt myself getting ready to just lose it and start yelling so (and I am really not proud of this) I went to the bathroom and took out my knife and cut like a six inch cut into the upper part of my arm. I don\u2019t know why I did it, but after I did it was like all the anger and stress was gone for a second. I\u2019ve tried texting a self harm helpline right after it happened, but it didn\u2019t connect fast enough and I don\u2019t know what to even say. \n\nShe hasn\u2019t drank anymore but we started arguing a few different times and for the last few months when people are yelling at or being hostile toward me I kinda lose it and just scream get the fuck away from me (which is completely opposite of me, I\u2019ve always been really good at staying calm in stressful situations) and I feel so angry and hot and breathe super fast, well when we were arguing I starting to feel that way and I went to the bathroom and cut myself again and all the emotions and everything went away. I was calm and able to walk out and function like was not just about to lose my shit.\n\nI want to know if the feelings/symptoms I have when she goes to leave after 8-9pm could be PTSD from the last 1.5 years of her crazy violent drinking and abuse? I am also on new meds for depression and have hypothyroid shit that is all outta wack that I am taking pills for but probably need a higher dose.  I know the cutting is crazy and I need help I just guess I am reaching out here first. \n\nI really need to find a VSO or someone to help me in the Tacoma/Seattle area that can help explain my benefits and figure out some of my stuff. I am at 70% but I had some stuff that got kicked back because I didn\u2019t have paperwork at the time. I am really embarrassed about all this crazy shit, and need to find a better way to cope. I have always been really good at dealing with high stress situations, but the last 4 months since I retired have just been really really hard. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the pills or what but I don\u2019t feel like myself, like I feel fucking crazy, but I don\u2019t want to get committed or fuck up my benefits.

It usually would only affect me slightly, only dazing me momentarily,  but i have done this a LOT.

I would feel pressure in my eye and ear, on the right side of my body, along with ringing in the ears. Even though no physical hit took place, it felt like i had been hit. Even when sober, i feel a related pressure in that area of my skull. Its constant. After feeling this after smoking, the last 2 nights, it caused me to have a panic attack, with violent shaking, muscle spasming/contracting, shortness of breath, and chills. The first night it just came on but last night, i tried my best to fight it off and accept the feeling i was feeling in my head but eventually it was like my muscles just gave up and started convulsing which spiralled everything else. I still, even as im writing this, feel the pressure in my head as if ive been hit. Other than the obvious (go to a doctor) what do you guys think? Does this sound more like ptsd flashbacks, or brain damage causing panic attacks? Ive smoked weed regularly for a very large portion of my life, including recently, so i really dont think its just from the weed.

I can\u2019t talk to my dad because he will say \u201cdon\u2019t make jokes about that stuff!\u201d Because the only way I can talk about this shit without crying is by joking about it. I can\u2019t talk to my mom because all she  will do it call my dad and put scar cream on my arms. I can\u2019t even talk to my sister anymore! And she was the first family member I actually told about my self harm. I can\u2019t talk to the councler because she will either call the hospital or will tell my parents to pick me up. I can\u2019t tell anyone anymore! I\u2019m so sick of people not believing that I\u2019m actually trying to get better! Hell I\u2019ve drank before just to make myself feel better about an awful situation because I didn\u2019t want to cut! My friends say they are here for me, but anytime I try to open up, they tell me not to cut anymore! Like It\u2019s not that easy! You think I Just wake up one morning and decide \u201cHEY ima let my childhood trauma haunt me and then cut the SHIT out of my arms and legs!!\u201d NO I don\u2019t try to do it on purpose!! And I can\u2019t even tell my own therapist because I don\u2019t want to make her feel uncomfortable! The only people I can talk to are people online! Can\u2019t believe that the only people I trust more than my own damn family are people I\u2019ve never met! Maybe it\u2019s because they can relate? Maybe it\u2019s because they don\u2019t know me personally? I don\u2019t know.  God things were so much easier before everyone found out! My friends and I could actually talk to eachother like friends should do. We would vent to eachother. We would support eachother. But now it just feels like we drifted apart.  God and 2 of my past exes took advantage of me all because I have low self esteem and no worth! HELL I\u2019ve tried to kms twice! But i never could go completely thru with it!  I just wish people would let me live like a normal person! Let me love like a normal person! Let me talk and behave like a normal person! I\u2019m not some cheap toy you buy from a gas station and when broken you put a new pair of batteries in thinking I\u2019m good as new!! \nGod why can\u2019t people understand", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

If this dosn't work then get a hair tie or rubber band and put it on and thwack yourself with it.

And I'm sorry. I did and I do still. I won't discuss the specifics of my problems becuase I hope my advice, or plea, will apply to everyone who reads this. Let's just say I've been there. I know what it is like. And I'm sorry. \n\nI want to close your eyes and imagine what your perfect life would be like. If you got away from toxic people in your life, if you had your dream job, if you had good and supportive friends, if you had a loving SO, if you had adventures to go on, if you were the person you dream of being. That's what I used to do. Imagine it in as much detail as you can and keep on. Maybe while falling asleep, to distract yourself from negative thoughts. If the real world is too hard to imagine being good, imagine it in your favorite world or universe. Be a shock trooper on Alderon or an Elven warrior in Lothl\u00f3rien, but with good friends and a healthy environment. \n\nI did that for 10 years while I dealt with crap and had to wait to get out of the toxic home in which I lived. While I had to wait until I could go to therapy and get help. \n\nAnd now I'm finally there, living the reality version (imperfect, but better) of my dream. I have a wonderful, loving husband and teammate who works every day to help me see the bright side of things, I'm in therapy working through and letting go of my past, I have work that is stressful but enjoyable, I have fun adventures, and honest and supportive friends. \n\nBut there is one problem. \n\nBecause I cut and burned and choked and hurt myself for so long, my body doesn't know how to respond to pain right anymore. My nerves and pain receptors or oversensitive and they respond to a lot of things they shouldn't. If I lightly hit my arm, I can feel it for 5 to 10 minutes as if i just hit it. Lightly hit my hip against a chair, pain for up to 20 minutes. Kisses from my husband can sometimes feel like needles, especially on my legs where I used to cut. Mucles tense? Pain. Typing too long? Pain. And the pain makes me tired and forgetful often. \n\nI am happy, and the emotional pain is past, but I can't enjoy it as much as I could because of what I used to do to cope. \n\nOne step you can do now to get closer to a better life is to give your body a break. Let it rest and heal. \n\nI know this post could never be enough to get you to quit, but I hope it can give you some motivation to try. Please try some other coping mechanisms or try to get some help. \n\nLife will be better in the future if you work towards it. You will be better in the future if you work towards it. And I really hope you all can enjoy your futures to the fullest.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

The teacher was setting up something and the class were all talking, once she had finished what she was doing she walked to the front of the loud class room and said,\"WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU ARE CLASS?\"which ended my daydream and I said in school because the night before I had decided to answer more in class. Well then I realise it wasn't a question your ment to answer, and it was kind of funny I wouldn't have minded and probably laughed at it later but what she then did was the worst thing she could possibly have done, I would have rather she expelled me.\nShe said come up here and she walked down and left me at top with everyone looking up and laughing at me.\nMade me stay up there for at least five or six minutes, up there I had about three anxiety attacks at once. When she finally asked if I had learnt my lesson I nodded and when back to my seat in the back corner as fast as I could without sprinting.\nIt was the last class before school ended and I skipped my locker (leaving all my homework in school) and went straight home where I locked my door pulled my curtains across and started to cry I don't know when exactly that day I self harmed but I only remember waking up the next morning and have to put on a long sleeved hoodie.\nI'm not sure if I over reacted, but if your I teacher reading this don't do something like this especially to some who's only said about ten words all year.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I\u2019m always like hating myself for shallow cuts and for cutting too little. \n\n(I don\u2019t know why I said this but my point is following) \n\nI sort of feel like I don\u2019t actually have a problem and I\u2019m faking all this for God knows why, maybe attention??? And if I want to stop I can control myself, but the thing is I DON\u2019T WANT TO, and I\u2019m not stoping. Maybe this also proves that I can\u2019t control myself.\n\nI also can\u2019t really figure out the reason I do this cuz sometimes I don\u2019t really feel like crap but I still do it (not all the time). It seems like I had a normal or even a nice day, but I still come home and cut. (This doesn\u2019t happen really often but still it happens) \n\nThe first time i started to SH was three years ago, and I\u2019ve been doing it on and off with periods that I\u2019m really down and just normal time in between. The past three months have been the worst \u201cperiod\u201d of mine. And it is sort of scary that in the beginning I knew what I was doing this for, to change the focus from the emotional pain and other social and academic stuff, something like that, but rn I don\u2019t even know why, that\u2019s the part that sort of scares me. \n\nI sometimes fear that I do this for attention. I really don\u2019t think so, but still I don\u2019t know if this is me in denial or what. I hide my scars mostly, only a few people know about this. Also some teachers know in school, and the nice part is they are super supportive. I talk to one teacher a lot and he is really happy to help me so ya things seem to be great. That\u2019s why I\u2019m afraid that me not wanting to stop is because I want help from him. But still I often feel like crap, like I\u2019m being ripped apart, but there is this fear that it\u2019s because I want someone to care or just talk to me, maybe even help.\n\nI\u2019m really confused about if I want to be helped or not, cuz I don\u2019t know if I want to get better. But the idea of doing this for attention is making me to hate myself so much, like nothing about my feelings is valid. And I just want to know if anybody also feels like this, or maybe someone can tell me that I\u2019m not an awful person.\n\nSorry if there\u2019re grammar mistakes and sorry that what I wrote is so not organized.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

My mom came up to help which I was extremely grateful for. She saw my self harm scars on my legs, and didn't say anything besides a comment about how I'm not to cut again. Fast forward three days and she just now came in and yelled at me over my \"dirty room\". The bed's not made, e.g. the pillows aren't put up properly. She then yelled at me saying I have no initiative or drive for life.  Then she basically brought up how she kept it a secret from my dad and he would have lost his shit. That every time I hurt myself I hurt those around me.  She then said my suffering is not as bad as someone who tried to commit suicide and what about my life is so terrible that I have no drive for life.  After all these platitudes and not saying anything. I ignored her and put in my headphones. I'm still ill with vertigo, and I just was not feeling up to battle it out. She yelled at me for that as well, when this is the first time that I have ignored her as such. \n\nFor me, cutting isn't about wanting to hurt myself, it's a coping mechanism for panic attacks and general anxiety. I only do it when I'm in extreme stress because if I'm hyperventilating, for example, then the action of cutting and the blood helps me breathe and calm down again.  It's not the best coping method, but it's better than passing out from lack of oxygen. The problem is I live with my parents while I'm waiting on my job to send me out to another country. I have no space of my own to relax, and my car is out of commission currently. The last time I even tried talking to her about anything she called me crazy and a terrible daughter with no will and was not ever going to be able to get a Ph.D, much less a master's. Then she asks why I don't talk to her about anything? \n\nI don't know, this just reinforces my desire to just quit everything and move away to Arkansas to be a barista with my friends.

Nothing else gives the same feeling I feel like I deserve more and worse hurt because I didn't feel any pain even if there is marks. Everything is to dull and pain is all I can think of right now.

I was looking for a temporary knife to use while I'm away and having a crisis, and I saw a lot of people recommending NOT to use serrated edges, and I had never encountered that before.\n\n**What is your general preference for edge types when cutting and why?**\n\nFor me, serrations are good because:\n\n1) Part of the rush is the intense pain, both during and after the cut. I've never cut extensively with straight edges that I can recall, so I'm not sure how to compare, but serrated cuts tend to sing with pain for a few days after.\n\n2) I feel like there's less risk of me cutting too deeply because I can feel the cuts so much, and because it generally feels like it would require more force. I'm actually nervous about incredibly sharp straight blades, I feel like I'd be more able to cut little bits that I don't mean to, especially when feeling out of control.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I don't like about serrated blades is that the technique for cutting can be scary and I have hurt myself more than I meant to before. I generally put the blade on or near my skin, and then pull or push it very quickly while pressing down, in order to get to blood. The problem is that depending on how taut the skin is and how the teeth catch it can rip unexpectedly wide or deep and I've had a few cuts that have left ginormous scars. They also don't really close up well when this happens -- my suspicion is that if I had them stitched the scarring would be much better. I'm imagining straight razors don't have this problem, or at least not to the same extent.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

For context, I'm a 24 year old third year graduate student dealing with a resurgence in self harm problems.\n\nSo alcohol has always been a way to escape emotions.

However, within the last year I've began noticing that I become overwhelmed with incredibly dark and negative thoughts when drinking. Disappearing from bars and clubs when out with friends was common, to just walk home to sulk until falling asleep.\nIt kind of started to progress until drinking was associated with thoughts of self harm.\n\nAbout a month ago it started to actually happen. I frequently drink alone, like getting a bottle and just having three to six shots a night of liquor, not TOO much. I'd start self harming aggressively but in a way that doesn't leave scars since I'm a teaching assistant and work with students so there are obvious reasons to avoid attention in that regard.\nBut yeah, it's crazy that such intense self destructive emotions come out after drinking when the entire time it's been the opposite.

All these things that dont even matter to me. All i can think about is how miserable life is...\n\nIn about 2 months i have an appointment with a psychiatrist, I'm getting help. I just need to get through the next 2 months.. This is my chance of finding the things i want to achieve and not what everyone expects me to if that makes any sence\n\n\nGudbye kind strangers,,\n hope this year will be good too all of you", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

It feels like someone else is the cutter and I just deal with the aftermath.\n\nIt doesn't  bother me, I don't care what people think when they see it. I just avoid the questions by covering up, because I don't know what to say when asked about it. \n\nPoint is, the cutter feels like someone else. Someone who feels the emotions. And I guess I'm just the one who doesn't feel anything and that's why it doesn't bother me. It's almost like it isn't really mine, my scars, my pain, it's the cutter's because I don't really know how I felt when I did it, only when I'm doing it. \n\nI don't know, probably weird, probably normal.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}
