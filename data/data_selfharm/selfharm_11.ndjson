Now having done it again a few times makes me want to keep doing it despite having lovely people around me who support me and a seemingly successful life. A tiny voice in my head says it's doomed anyway and that once I have gone down this path, it doesn't really matter. And I am getting something from self harm I don't get in other aspects of my life, it's a way for me to express my emotional pain and feelings of worthlessness. Will the urge to harm myself never go away? It feels like I'm lacking a lot of affection, attachment and reassurance and that I don't feel I can get this, ever. Even though I am with people who I love and who love me. I feel like there's so much wrong with me, it seems unfixable. \nAnd to be honest, sometimes I don't want it to be fixed and just wallow in self pity and hatred if I am being honest.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Dreams of suicide, guilt and a constant feeling of me being the cause of the issue. Suicide is always the worst for me because while I do think of suicide I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m serious. In my dreams of it it\u2019s always quick. It\u2019s always easy. It\u2019s scary. And the guilt I feel for feeling like this is overwhelming and it\u2019s a weight I can\u2019t lift because I can\u2019t stop and I stress because I make myself by focusing on the pain from the scabs and scars I cause myself.\n\nAnd all I want then is to find a way out and the way out becomes suicide. And there the cycle starts again, over and over, like a vicious loop I can\u2019t escape. I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s me trying to escape anymore because I enjoy the pain and guilt and lack of sleep or occasionally just hitting myself till my arm goes numb because if nothing else it\u2019s something to replace me scarring myself. \n\nBut then I want those scars. Because while I feel guilty part of me feels inferior for never cutting deep. When I do scar it\u2019s because of my methods with my nails. And God how it stings. I love it. Pain that makes you want to scream, pain that pushes you just that bit closer to the edge. \n\nThis started off with dreams because before all of this I still had those dreams.

I've lied to and am lying to so many people everyday. I'm breaking so many promises everyday. College started on 2nd August. College is in city A and my parents live in City B. My aunt lives in city A but she lives far from the college so I live on campus alone in the dorm or hostel or whatever it's called and on weekends I go to my aunt's place. On the first day I met this guy Rain and became really close with him I've never met someone I gel with so much. I've always lied and exaggerated about not so serious stuff and I lied to Rain also. Then I met this girl Snow in the second week of college. I've never spoken to girls before and I was really introverted in school because I just hate myself. I don't know when this started but I just hate the way I look the way I look while doing stuff like walking moving running playing talking the way I talk my voice the way I interact with people I have no personality so I'm really uncomfortable when I'm talking to people especially girls. I don't know why I'm like this I was bullied abit in middle school but it was nothing serious. Anyway I met Snow and I just felt different around her. She made me feel good about myself being around her just made me happy and I really liked being around her. I really admire her and she's one of the nicest ppl I've ever met. Anyway for the past 4 years my mom used to just yell at me randomly and for no reason but i didn't really care about it much. Then during the third week of college my mom sends me a really long apology message  regarding that and I don't know what happened I didn't really care about it much but it made me cry ALOT and I never cry. It just triggered me I didn't even care about it but for some reason I kept crying and feeling bad about it then one day I just threw hands at the wall and got hurt and I guess this was my first time I self harmed. Anyway Snow noticed that I had punched the wall and asked me what happened and I told her but I was crying and shit while telling her and I made it seem like what happened with my mom was a really bad even though it was not and I didn't really care about it and I felt like I was just doing it all for her sympathy and attention. I lied to her that I got addicted to mentos to cope with what was happening with my mom also. Then I promised her that I'll never have mentos again which was easy coz I lied about being addicted to it and I promised that I won't hurt myself ever again. This was like my first serious lie coz I lied I exaggerated the whole thing. Then for 2-3 weeks everything was good. Then we just started sitting separate but I had Rain with me so it was fine then for a couple days she just took a long time to reply to my texts and I don't why but I just started overthinking everything. I told Rain I loved her and exaggerated some shit to him about her ignoring me and coz of the way I said it he thought she was a bitch and she was just leading me on then I started crying and saying shit like what did I do to deserve this for his sympathy I think. Then I started punching walls again and I searched Google for punching walls and ran into this sub and saw ppl cut, burn etc I tried cutting and it felt good. Initially I just felt brave and proud doing it and I wanted to tell someone about it like it was an achievement so I told one of my friends from city B and told him I'm doing it coz of Snow he got really worried and found Snow through and Instagram and told her what I was doing..Then I felt like shit coz she thought I cut myself coz of her even though I just did that coz Im a jealous pathetic piece of shit attention whore. I confronted her and lied to her again. I just told her that I used to cut myself in school coz I was bullied really bad and I got addicted to it but then I stopped but recently with College starting being away from my parents the stuff that happened with my mom and I made up some lies about my aunt I even cried and said coz of all this I relapsed. I just didn't want her to feel bad coz she's a really nice person and does not deserve this shit. I told my friends in college including Rain the same lies and promised everyone I won't cut anymore. This went down on 2nd October. Anyway I genuinely do love her or at least like her alot coz whenever I get any form of attention from her I feel really really really really happy but then I feel really bad coz I don't get to hang out with her much and I can't bring myself to sit with her or hang out with her without feeling like shit about what I did. I get really jealous and triggered when she's talking to people who aren't me. Anyway I promised everyone I stopped but I cut almost everyday it's either one small deep cut or a bunch of shallow long ones.  I hate to say this but I think she's the trigger. Whenever I see her give attention to other people I just start feeling like I'm not good enough especially coz I don't see her much these days and my hate for myself just gets multiplied. After I confronted her for a week I was talking to her and texting her and initiating stuff but after that I've just stopped caring I don't initiate stuff anymore but if I see her talking to others I get triggered and if I get a call or text from her or she talks to me I feel really really good. I found out she videocalls one of the guys from my class almost everyday and that just triggered me and I cut alot. Anyway that's the college situation. My parents and my aunt don't know I self harm. I snapped rubber bands on my wrist last week which left scars that look like burn scars. When I went to my aunt's house last weekend she noticed it. I told her I have a secret habit of snapping rubber bands and I had a really bad day in college where I studied alot for a test and didn't score ( that's a lie I didn't study shit but I cried and said I'm stressed about studies and stuff so she believed) so i kept doing it and got hurt. Anyway I got careless and there was blood on the bedsheets I gave her to wash she called me about it 2 days ago and she's really suspicious now I don't know when she'll confront me about it. I'm not going to her place this weekend so that probably made her even more suspicious and it's hot where I live and I always wear full sleeves when I go to her place so I don't know how I'm gonna deal with this. I'll just lie about some studies shit again. Anyway for about a week now I just want something bad to happen to me so I can justify killing myself. I had a dream that I was in class and I got a call saying my parents are dead then I just punch a window and run out and with my friends chasing after me I reach my room lock it make a deep vertical cut on my wrist then it's just black. I keep thinking about bad things happening to me. I just feel like slowly dying in all these lies. I don't know what to do I just wanna be happy but the thing that makes me happy also makes me feel like shit. I know deserve all this and I've created this situation for myself it's not like I'm tired of lying or cutting I can keep doing that but I would rather be happy but I can't do that without telling the truth and the truth will hurt everyone especially Snow who doesn't deserve this all she did was be nice to me and make me happy and I do this shit. I spoke to someone on Reddit about this and it felt a lil good he told me to tell someone in my life but I've lied to everyone so I don't know who to tell and what if I do something like this again and what if I lie while telling them out of instinct. I just wanted to post this to feel a lil better coz today I saw snow in class get up from where she usually sits and sit with this guy I've never seen her speak to before and I don't know what happened to me my heart started hurting I started breathing heavy I got a STRONG urge to cut but I was in class so I couldn't do anything I just felt like I lost control. I'm not a nice person. Thank you for reading and have a nice day .", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I grew up in northern ontario canada and it's kind of a shit hole.  The whole mental health thing wasn't really known there and no one including my family took it seriously.  Even after a very serious and public suicide attempt I had near crippling anxiety and there wasn't a single psychiatrist I could see to be put on medication. I hear a lot of people speak about mental health awareness but it really wasn't that big up there. I've only seen maybe 1-2 people with self harm scars in real life and I didn't see a single person ever do it through my time at school.\n\nAnyways I moved to college last year and it went very poorly.  Got hooked on some harder drugs, starting smoking cigs, beeing drunk all night.  I got repeatedly sexually assaulted or abused, I'm not really sure but it definitely wasn't okay.  Dropped out of school, gambled away all my money.  Lost a bunch of jobs.  Fun stuff.  \n\nWhen I came home I was very depressed and suicidal and I cut myself for the first time.  Then again and again and again and eventually my arms and legs were covered.  I feel very emberassed having started this in my early 20's, I feel like I'm too old to be doing this.   My dad caught a glance at my leg while I sleeping once but that's the only person who's come close to seeing my scars.  I've worn long sleeves more or less constantly throughout the last year.       \n\nIt's to the point where there's no real going back and no hiding it.  The damage is already done and although I don't cut very deep there's just hundreds of them, there's no way they wouldnt be seen if I were to wear something else.  I don't have any friends but I want to put myself out there again and maybe start dating, I've just been really lonely lately.  I'm scared of how people will react.  \n\nWhen I was in highschool people at work would always talk about my suicide attempt behind my back and I don't want something like that happening again.  I don't want to be paranoid all day someone's going to find out.  Every time my scars come close to showing I get a panic attack and it's making it difficult to function.  I keep thinking about what people will say, what they'll do, if anyone will notice, etc.  I spend every minute of every day in my head and I can't focus on anything else.  I'm not in a position to stop doing it right now but I'm clearly not going to show fresh cuts. \n\nI'm thinking maybe I'll ease my way into it.  I tried going for walks with my longsleeves rolled up but any time someone came close I rolled them up.  I've also started wearing t-shirts at night and when my parents go out of town.  I don't want to spend my whole life paranoid and afraid someone is going to see my body.  I want to be comfortable and feel safe but it's a lot easier said than done.  \n\nHoly fuck I meant to write like 2 paragraphs I'm sorry I kinda went on there.  But anyways this brings me to my real question.  How did friends/family/strangers react when you started sharing? Do you ever get comments in public, do people look weird or stare or anything?

I met someone who I'll call G, G and I have been friends for about 8 months but have only really gotten close since 4 months ago when she discovered my depression and decided that she wanted to help me. G is probably the greatest thing that's happened to me and without her I reckon that I'd have tried to kill myself again, so when she opened up to me about her history with depression I was understandably supportive. Then she told me that she used to cut, which was strange because I had never known anyone who actually did it but I always heard about it. G told me how addicted she was to cutting and how it took her a very long time to completely quit. But hearing how much it helped her with suicidal thoughts I thought that I'd try it the next time that I feel that way, and it really helped. I'm not going to go into detail because we all do it and understand how it feels but it helps me with these thoughts. Once I told her a few days ago she was understandably upset, but a couple moments of silence later she made me promise to tell her every time I cut, without thinking of the consequences I did, and immediately she promised that every time that I cut, she will also cut.\n\nI'm really stuck now, for one I'm not going to break my promise and just not tell her. Second, my one way of coping with these thoughts that I've done for 3 months is now out the window.

I used to cut, burn, skin pick, drink too much, sometimes binge and purge but I stopped cold turkey when my boyfriend made it clear it was a deal breaker, he catches me one time and he is gone. I was all alone except for him, kicked out of the college dorms because of a cutting incident with no where to go, he was all I had so I had to do it. We stayed together and got married. \n\nI'm turning 27 this month and for the past few months I've been having more frequent and more intense urges to self harm. These past 6 years I dealt with all my negative feelings and unresolved issues by unconsciousy binge eating, I gained a good amount of weight. \n\nThings have been really rough, my husband changed after I had our son (nearly 2yo now). I became a stay at home mom and he started having high expectations of me, basically he goes to work and makes the money and takes out the garbage once a week. I do everything else. He is no longer sweet and kind to me, he says I've become stagnant and he has grown so much as a person and it's disappointing I can't do the same. He is really unhappy with my weight gain over the years. He isn't mean to me so much as indifferent and cold a lot. He is a great father to our son though, he always takes time for him and treats him very well.\n\n4 months ago he lost his steady job of 4 years and he just finally found a new job, I temporarily worked as much as I was able to without having to send our son to day care. I wracked up a good amount of debt in 4 months seeing as we only had enough cash to pay rent and our car payment. Utilities, gas, food, diapers etc all went onto my credit card.\n\nThere is so much stress and hurt in me right now, no one to go to for help or a hug or anything. I have this weird feeling in my arms, just like an impatient tingling warmth like my body is begging me to cut. I can't though, because if I get caught I am screwed, I wouldn't be surprised if my husband would leave me. I'd be alone, piled with debt and without my son. The only thing stopping me is my son, I can't let him down, I can't let myself get caught up in my own BS and make him suffer the consequences. \n\nIt's so hard though, I feel floaty and like I'm in a dream. Hours just seem to disappear and I am having a hard time focusing on things. I don't feel grounded and I know that if I selfharm, I'll snap back into myself and feel normal again. At the same time it would probably start a snow ball effect and ruin me in the end.

He rode with his police bike to an emergency, but then was cut off by a young guy in a car. He stayed in the icu for a total of 2 weeks. In that first week, my world turned upside down. I couldnt think straight, had to force myself to eat etc.\nOn day 5 after the crash, my dad had an important operation. So I was on edge. Of course i had to forget both of my oral exams at that day. On the second time, i tried to explain my teacher that i had family issues at home. A guy, who was a good friend of mine and knew of everything shoutet: Thats just one of your stupid excuses you cunt. I was livid. But i swallowed all of my anger and moved back to my place. Then another guy who also knew what was up said: OP wouldnt you like to elaborate your reaction? You can let your feelings loose in here.\nI was an inch away of jumping the guy to beat him into a crying pile of blood.\nBut i simply turned around and said with a voice so full of hatred, that i had to press it out:\nIf I let my feelings loose, i will most likely snap your f/ing neck.\n\nNow to the real Problem: since that day something is growing inside me, something i can only discribe as a Void. It feels like its tearing part after part from me. And the hole it makes fills itself with dread, hatred and sadness.\nMostly the void keeps the upper hand, but sometimes it loses its power and lets some emotions through. Mostly its dread. And its just overpowering me. But sometimes a little bid of that hatred comes out. And in these moments i have to use everything that I have, so i dont loose my mind. What I really fear is that everything comes out at once.\n\nSo I searched for a solution, and I found it.\nBut not a good one.\nIf i cut, strangle, bite or burn myself, that feeling goes back, it pushes back the void. It kinda makes me fee whole...\n\nBut the intensity rises Everytime a little bid. I could stop myself from directly hurting myself for a few days. But in that time i started to rub and soon to scratch my cuts, until they got scars.\nI have now started to cut myself again. \nBut its not enough, my hands start to shake, until i feel the pain, but today they didnt stop. I felt how the void grows bigger and bigger, even though im activly working against it.\n\nIdk what to do.\nI wont get a to a psych and i definitly wont tell my parents...\n\nAny ideas?", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Many times my posts are of overlooked. And that\u2019s fine!\n\nBut something about writing my feelings out in words just... helps. It helps me address them directly. It helps me come to terms with things and reason with them. \n\nAnd reading other people\u2019s posts on here has also felt good to me. as selfish as it may seem, it\u2019s consoling to know that I\u2019m not suffering alone, and that there are other people with the same experience as me. I sometimes see others posts and feel so much compassion for them and genuine hope for them to get better. It makes me think that someone else might see my posts and want that for me too. \n\nPosting on this sub/other mental health subs has led me to try and stop cutting. Without this, I would never have bothered trying to reason why I do this. I would have just continued doing it, festering in my depression and anxiety. Now that I\u2019ve addressed the reasoning, it\u2019s easier to try and stop because I can understand what\u2019s going on. \n\nFor the longest time my self harm was like a big creature following me around that only I could see. If I acknowledged it, it would get me. I just had to live with the constant shadow of it over my shoulder. Even thinking about it would make it mad. I think that being open about it has, at least partially, chased away that shadow. It\u2019s still there, but it\u2019s weaker. And it\u2019s calls for me to cut myself are fainter. I can actually see it for what it is now. Not some secret pet that I keep on a leash that helps me calm down and focus. I\u2019m the one on the leash, and now that I\u2019ve acknowledged that, I can move forward. \n\nTalking openly about it online has made it so much easier to think about it openly, too.\n\nToday I even gathered the courage to post a one week clean photo of my shoulder on r/selfharmscars. It\u2019s not the same as being able to publicly wear a tank top, like I\u2019ve always wanted. (Tbf even if I didn\u2019t cut I would still have horrible bacne.) But even then it still felt therapeutic. Like a weight had been taken off my shoulders. Someone said that their arm looked the same way, and that they were getting a tattoo to cover it, and it just warmed me up inside for some morbid reason. I wasn\u2019t alone. And especially because I\u2019ve had an idea for a tattoo in the same place that I dream of getting. I guess it\u2019s just proof that I can be \u2018normal,\u2019 I can get past this, and I can achieve that dream of that cool tattoo just like that person did.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I hope I don't, because I use my hands a lot at work and absolutely need it covered there for safety. \n\nI kind of wish I didn't do this, but it's too late now. The neck yeets were shallow and will heal soon, but this burn will likely take weeks, which sucks.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

My depression is pretty on and off. Most of the time I'm just feeling numb. Other times, I get to feel so hopeless that my mind immediately turns to self-harm (punching something until your fingers can barely move or the knuckles start to bleed, cutting, slapping / punching myself).\n\nWhile sometimes I have considered self-harm while feeling numb just to get some level of emotional response, my main release (gaming) has been a decent coping mechanism. I have a community of online friends who I love to play games with and talk to. It really keeps my mind off of everything.\n\nBut when I start thinking at basically any level about myself, my mind goes from numb to downright hopeless. I start questioning my existence, my self-worth, how I've been negatively effecting people my whole life, I think about how I'm a failure, etc. These thoughts just compound continuously until I just break down or try to go back to the numb state by using self-harm tactics, which easily distract me from my main thoughts.\n\nThis happened again a few days ago and I felt scared this time. I went to seek therapy on my college campus, but I felt that the therapy wasn't very good (after two sessions and a group therapy session).\n\nIt took me roughly ten years to finally seek mental help. Feeling that it was worthless when I was expecting it to \"save\" me (or at least guide me in the right direction) pushed me into a highly depressed state.\n\nI'm not sure if I would have self-harmed that night, had I a knife. I certainly punched my bed frame a few times, but not enough to draw blood. Instead, I went out and found a nice, quiet place to break down. Over the next few days (Thursday to Sunday), I pretty much stayed in bed all day. I'd never felt lower. I skipped all my college classes over Thursday and Friday, excusing myself with \"being sick\" because I can't tell anybody what's going on.\n\nOverall, right now, I feel hopeless. Therapy here seems like a joke to me. I placed all my hope in that and that hope is just shattered now. I want to get better and identify my problems, but I suffer from so much anxiety that thinking about specific things makes me start to hyperventilate and feel incredibly panicked. I'm waking up feeling like I haven't gotten an ounce of sleep, and my entire body feels like it's coated in lead.\n\nFor now, I want to stop my self-harm practices but I don't even know where to start.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I didn't remember one coworker saying anything, but I asked a friend the next day and they said he was freaked out by my scars and had to ask my friend about them. I'm just so tired of worrying whether I should wear short sleeves or not, about what someone will think. Worrying about that fraction of a second of hesitation when they see them and realize what they are, whatever warped conclusions they may come to from just seeing them. That they won't ask questions and will be uncomfortable being around me knowing what's under my jacket sleeves. Idk, it just pisses me off because I've always worried about others' perceptions of them. I wore nothing but long sleeves for 4-5 years because I didn't want anyone to see them and think I'm a freak or be uncomfortable. I've been publicly wearing short sleeves regularly for only a year now, and the thought is still at the forefront everytime I pass someone on the sidewalk or in a building or wherever. It just sucks, like, I'm sorry they bother you but imagine what's bothered me for them to be there in the first place. Maybe that's too much to ask, it almost certainly is, but it still sucks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat's weird though is that sometimes I'm equally bothered when people don't see them, like if I've been around them multiple times or for prolonged periods of time and they still don't see them it fucks with me. Maybe it feels like they don't actually see me or acknowledge me as anything other than my voice. I just wish more people would ask questions or at least acknowledge them. But then I'd probably be worried they'd joke or say something incredibly misinformed about them (doing it for attention/sexual reasons). Idk, there's no solution to this, just posting this here because I need to get this thought out of my head and there's only two other people I know whom I might be able to talk to about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyone else feel the same?", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I stopped cutting for awhile after that because I hated the time I had there but afterwards after I left the foster home I went back home and started cutting more because I had nothing in my life and all my friends called my depression fake and for attention and it made me feel horrible so I cut myself again. Then after awhile I got moved to my uncles for cutting and drugs so I felt trapped there I had no friends and no one to talk to. My uncle is the out doors type so he had a lot of guns and knives so once he found out about my cuts he locked up his guns and before he can take his knifes I took one and they didn\u2019t notice. It turned into cutting my arms everyday and trying to hide them was a pain. I got kicked out of that house because of my ex girlfriend and I got moved to my old house which made me feel horrible because of the past experiences in the house. I craved to cut myself the whole time. I\u2019ve moved back like 3 weeks ago and at that time I was still dating my girlfriend but we broke up yesterday and it wasn\u2019t very good she\u2019s on my mind constantly and I always feel like cutting and yesterday I couldn\u2019t take it I exploded I took my pencil went to the bathroom and started cutting my arm it didn\u2019t leave cuts just welts. And it didn\u2019t do the job for me so I started using scissors that I stole from the teacher and started cutting in the bathroom and I messed up my arm badly not to brag because that\u2019s not what I\u2019m trying to do but it felt good it felt like an addiction that I couldn\u2019t control.

I had self harmed on and off for 5 and a half years at that point and I wanted to stop.  \n\nFast forward to September of this year and I was 9 months clean!! Until one of my coworkers came along. \n\n\"So you a cutter?\", he asks. He begins asking me some personal questions, he tells me his granddaughter used to cut, and by the end of the conversation he offered me his number and told me to talk to him if I felt like doing it again. He reminded me that I'm not alone. Sounds nice enough, right?\n\nWell, a few days later I relapsed. After 9 whole months I cut again. \n\n***Why?***\n\nI didn't realize why until recently. During those 9 months I had (almost unintentionally) nurtured a mindset that did not revolve around hurting myself. I got so good that I would go *weeks* without even thinking about it! I'd see my scars on my arm and they no longer registered self hatred and an urge to cut. In a sense, I reached some level of peace with my history of self harm. I emphasize history, because at that point it was put behind me. \n\nExcept when that coworker brought it up, all of a sudden my brain woke up again. My brain suddenly shifted and remembered all the past urges and struggles I had with it. After a couple days of fighting the intrusive thoughts and urges, I relapsed. \n\nMind you, my coworker didn't come from a place of malice. He had good intentions. But I went those 9 months so peacefully because no one tried having a conversation with me about it. It's almost like I need to be 100% in control of the conversation in order for me to not get triggered. The conversation I had with him was, while good natured, rather one sided. He asked, I answered (to an extent). \n\nIt's November now, and I just recently had my worst self harm session to date. I'm not putting all the blame on this guy, but it's odd how just that one conversation created a snowball effect. I went from being clean to really fucking up my arm and regretting how much damage I've done.\n\nTL;DR, be careful when trying to bring up a conversation about someone's self harm. Even if you have good intentions, you can unintentionally trigger them. My first recommendation would be to ask for permission first. I didn't have time to process if I really wanted to be in the conversation or not.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I haven't gone to Uni for two days because I can't bring myself to get out of bed. Walking to the station, traveling in the subway, being with people, interacting in general brings me so much anxiety that I feel terrible. I want to make deep cuts and have them bleed for a few hours till I feel okay and can carry on daily activities again. I've run out of food and clean water so I boil it till it's clean and drink ketchup soup and black coffee. I can't bring myself to order food because I'm scared of facing the delivery guy.\n\nI feel like talking to no one and staying hidden because all I feel is shame and embarrassment. I'm counting on the hope that more cuts will make things normal.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Those of you who have been here from the beginning may remember me as the fellow that would play the piano on Discord.\n\nIt has been almost five years since the creation of this subreddit and a lot has changed. We made this place as a safe haven to poke fun at one of the strangest things that humans do, and by golly have we succeeded. Unbelievably there are now sixteen thousand of us. \n\nIn November 2017 I was diagnosed with cancer of the thyroid and kidneys. I was told I had less than eighteen months to live. Naturally this was something of a reality check for me so I promptly got off reddit and tried to live what little life I had left. Of course it didn't take me long to realise that getting cancer doesn't just flick a switch and make you into someone new - you're just the same person, except now you know what's probably going to kill you. \n\nThe months flew by as I got wasted, lived dangerously and generally lost all regard for the value of my life. Like anyone with a timer ticking over them I felt the pressure of existence even more so than ever. Honestly I have been in such a state that I can barely remember anything between 2017 to the first half of this year. \n\nI do not especially want to dwell on the minutia of my illness and treatment, so I will boil it down to this: I got very, very lucky and am now cancer free. Thinking I was a dead man walking lead me down some very dark roads but I somehow made it through. For the first time ever I came out on top. \n\nI am so very sorry for abandoning this place but I had no choice. I was so rapt in my own misery and suffering that I lost all perspective on every facet of my life. I am going to try and become an active moderator and community member again - I owe that to the community that gave me so much love and support in a time when no one else would. \n\nThank you all. By bringing such life to this place in my absence you have warmed my soul. \n\nIt's now been years since I self-harmed, [here's what remains of that time in my life](https://imgur.com/0cKdWqI.jpg).\n\nI love you all dearly and wish you all the best. \n\nSincerely,   \nHoopla the Hobo", "subreddit": "MadeOfStyrofoam"}

At this point I don\u2019t care cause what kinda friend says that shit \n\nBut yeah any advice on what I should do? How I should talk to her? Or anyone who went through a similar situation??? I\u2019d love to hear someone\u2019s thoughts/ stories", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I\u2019m on meds, see a therapist etc so all good but I\u2019ve always kept it discrete and put on a brave face for my parents. I don\u2019t cut so there\u2019s no classic giveaway scars that you could notice.\n\nAnyway... my dad (with whom I have a difficult relationship with) recently caught me at an event with a bandage on my wrist from where I\u2019d bludgeoned it. He asked what happened and I didn\u2019t want to lie so I told him I\u2019d had a panic attack and done it to myself. \n\nI just learned that he\u2019s been telling everyone that I\u2019m just a stupid attention seeker, even though I\u2019ve self-harmed for years without anyone noticing. My mental health isn\u2019t secret but I don\u2019t talk about unless I\u2019m asked and if I wanted attention they would have found out years ago. I\u2019m so hurt by this I don\u2019t know what to do. Has anyone else ever had something similar?", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I spent days at first scrolling through the accounts of people just like me. Morbid as they were they made me feel community. That even in the darkest minutes when I questioned myself, led hand in hand by  imposter syndrome to the conclusion that I wasn\u2019t really ill, there were all these people yelling that I was. Telling me to go hydrate, unclench my jaw and all these other self care tips that are akin to putting sellotape on a bone deep wound. But at least they also felt the hate that I couldn\u2019t quite explain for anti self harm tips. They were able to verbalise what I couldn\u2019t always do myself. And yet I couldn\u2019t help but feel, after hearing people say that they were in the ER again, for the tenth time that maybe I wasn\u2019t supposed to be here; that maybe I wasn\u2019t actually self harming, but rather imitating people who actually had depression.\r\n\r\nI still get those seconds of self doubt. Even when the knife is in my hand and I\u2019m actively stabbing myself in the back my mind is screeching that i\u2019m only really slashing at thin air. Even though I still scroll and scroll, spending hours forcing myself to relate to posts in an effort to feel worse, I still feel as though whatever i\u2019m feeling or doing, its not enough. This is a double edged sword. I feel community but I feel alone and so utterly worthless. Not because I am ill, like any normal person, but because i\u2019m not ill enough.\r\n\r\nSo heres to those who can\u2019t entirely relate. Even when the screen is black and they\u2019re sitting there listening to a friend\u2019s account of a panic attack and they still feel awfully guilty. Even when they had what everyone else called panic attacks but they still doubt that they weren\u2019t being overdramatic. Even when the last time that happened was three years ago. Even when they regret the therapy they had. Even when The guilt stems from a near unadmittable desire to be worse. I still want to feel as though I deserve recognition. Every single fucking nerve cell in my body wants to be ill and dangerous enough to myself to warrant the hours spent scrolling. A strange feeling curls itself around my spine every time I talk to my friends who are worse than me. Despite their reassurances that they feel the way I do, everything I say seems to be overridden by their experiences that sound worse to my ear.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s the same on here, however much the different experiences from so many different people dilute the whirlpool of lonely echoing voices, I cant help but feel not enough. The comradery in suffering from all angles is lost in translation and all I hear is the insides of my skull pulsating with one message; be worse and maybe then you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re no longer sat in the purgatory between self harmers and everyone else. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the worst thing of all is that my skin shows the marks that I have made and yet all I do is justify that I was worse then, despite not actively making any effort to feel better. Even though I threw my head back to feel the satisfying crack it made against the wall just days ago and winced at the sound alerting my dad rather than at the headache I had caused. Even though so much evidence points to the contrary, I still have let imposter syndrome throw a tantrum and dredge up all the people worse than me whilst I sit here, fingers in ears and feel pretty goddamn numb. No I am not cutting to feel something as numbness should suggest, but because the thing in my head is telling me I can\u2019t call myself a self harmer because I haven\u2019t done it enough in the past half a year. Because there aren\u2019t enough scars somehow. Because even though I try, the left side of my stomach hurts more than the right side and that is somehow offensive to this figure that doles out judgement.\r\n\r\nIts only really now that I realise how many things I do to abate this tantrum throwing bitch. I dig a deeper hole around myself without really knowing if i\u2019ll eventually end up out of this purgatory or if i\u2019ll just keep digging the grave these tendencies will inevitably lie me in.\r\n\r\nSo this has turned into a love letter to the MOS community  but a hate filled letter to the imposter syndrome that has filled my gut with tendrils of dread every time I open reddit.

So I got a fun little trip to the ER! Luckily it\u2019s 100% covered because I make so little money a month that I qualified for their financial assistance, but I still have a standard doctors fee (which is fine, at least it\u2019s not a fucking ER bill).\n\nChanged my address to where I moved out to so my parents won\u2019t find out. Does anyone know if I\u2019ll just get the bill in the mail in a few days? I\u2019ve never dealt with this before and the internet won\u2019t tell me shit.\n\nThey thought I cut an artery at first and scared the fuck out of me making me think I might need surgery.

Neither have I been around people who are/have the previously mentioned actions/conditions. So if I come off as clueless, that may be why.**  \nwith that out of the way, here's the rest of the post  \n\n\nI have this friend in school, she's 13. Same class, I became friends with her through proxy. As I was friends with a friend and that's how we got our social connection. I'd mostly been ignoring her in favour of her other friend but I knew some stuff. It was an open secret that she and her friend both self-harmed. No one seemed too bothered about stopping them, at most, it was \"***hey, how about don't***\" and that was it. I wasn't any of them as frankly, they just weren't in my social group. Up until the last few months where I'd lost many friendships through inactivity and I began getting closer to these two.  \n\n\nNow, since I became good friends with them. I learnt the true extent of the self-harm and just how *fucking* bad it was. Her friend self-harmed, little cuts on the thigh and arm. But holy shit. This woman made her friend look like a fucking paper cut.   \nGashes, and I mean, fucking gashes across her whole arm. Wounds just left out - It's a miracle how they haven't been infected yet. One time, she cut right next to me in class like she didn't care. Cutting her finger, pinching the blood out, letting it all trickle down her hand before whipping it all off.  \n\n\nI was... shocked to see just how bad it was.   \n\n\nNow, I've seen the memes about peoples responses to this stuff on Reddit in the past. So I didn't want to say things like \"***Think about your friends***\" or any of the other shit they'd been told over the years. Because frankly, I knew that wasn't getting anyone anywhere.  \nHer friend, I'd talked to her over the span of months and she'd managed to remain clean for four months. But in October, she began again due to the stress and anxiety of school. I was heartbroken to find out she started again but this whole experience taught me that it is possible to get someone clean via supporting them and not saying useless generic quotes  \n\n\nSo I've tried my goddamn hardest to always be there for her, I always hit a message saying I'm available, I try to send her memes and talk about how she knows we're all here for her. But despite that, she hasn't shown any signs of progress.   \nI'm not expecting someone to stop cutting within a month but if anything, she's gotten worse.  \nConstantly going to the bathroom to cut.   \nI feel so fucking bad but at the same time I don't know what to do  \n\n\nShe once told me something that has stuck with me whenever it comes to her situation   \n\"*Would you rather have me Cut or Kill myself?*\" and I keep replaying that over in my head. It makes sense in a weird way. I don't want her to kill herself but at the same time, self-harm especially this bad. Can't be healthy. I know she isn't in a great place right now and there's nothing I can do to get her out of that. The underlying issue here is that she's miserable and depressed and incredibly suicidal. And I can't change the things causing that like her home life, or her neglectful Mom or her diet that consists of just water because she's anorexic and can't eat food.   \n\n\nThe only positive thing going for her I guess would be her friend group. She's got me, her Friend which I've mentioned. And four other people. But only me and her friend are the two that are desperately trying to stop her from cutting.   \n\n\nFrankly... I have no idea what to do, she just keeps doing it because it's a literal addiction so she can't stop. And there's nothing I can do to help her home-life or cure her anorexia. All I can reasonably do is keep talking to her on WhatsApp and keep trying to make her laugh at school.   \n\n\nIf you read this far, I'm thankful you took the time to read this post. I made it because I don't know if there's something I'm missing from this, maybe there's something I can do or say to try and ease the situation. Because right now, if she doesn't get the help she needs. She will kill herself and that whole scenario breaks me to think about.   \n\n\n**TLDR:** A girl I'm friends with is doing very gory and deep cuts all across her body and she's suicidal and anorexic. The only thing she has going for her is her friends. I try and make her laugh at school and listen to her on WhatsApp but I'm wondering if there's something I'm *not* doing that could try and solve this issue before the worst-case scenario occurs.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I even went to intensive outpatient. I see my therapist at like 7:30 tonight.\n\nI dont think i can wait until then. I need someone to talk to. I texted a friend i made in the hospital but she hasnt replied. I want to hurt myself. Im having thoughts about killing myself. I want to drink.\n\nThis sub is very responsive and supportive and I feel like its my only option right now. I hope I don\u2019t sound like a whiny projecting bitch.\n\nMy sister had been waiting for months for my parents to fully refinish her room. Now she has new furniture from target and ikea. Shes all moved back in. It took a while for her to actually start living here again but its been a week or two since shes been back.\n\nLast week my mom start treating me weird again. She treats everyone nicely but when she sees me she tells me to do the dishes. We\u2019ve been letting the neighbors cat in the house because its been cold out. One second shes enjoying his company and commenting that the neighbors take poor care of him (totally declawed, spends a lot time outside, its snowed) and the next shes arguing with me that he needs to be put outside.\n\nSometimes when i get upset she asks if ive been taking my medication. I take it religiously unless i forget. My sister on the other hand has the same problems i do and more. Depression, anxiety, migraines. Yet she doesnt take her medicine.\n\nI was in the car with my parents on the weekend to see my grandma and my mom was talking and saying that she thought seeing my grandma was going to be a date. I think she was mad i came along. I told her if it was a date it would be called \u201ca date\u201d not \u201clets go visit grandma\u201d.  She said \u201cI was talking to dad. I didn\u2019t ask for your opinion.\u201d Exactly that. I was sitting between her and my dad since we took the truck. She\u2019s insane if she thinks she can have a direct, private conversation with someone else in the vehicle and someone else sitting between her and her target. Maybe i was out of line a bit but it hurt when she said \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for your opinion.\u201d That wasn\u2019t very nice. She said it in such a mean way.\n\nEarlier that night she was helping my sister with her psoriasis and she told me to put the neighbours cat out and asked me to feed the dog. She seemed off when she was talking to me and normal, happy, etc with my sister. I told her she should have fed him when she got home. I played switcharoo with the cats and fed the dog. She mentioned there were \u201ctoppings\u201d for the dog in the fridge when she asked me to feed the dog but i just gave him kibble. She told my sister \u201cI don\u2019t think he got his toppings\u201d. I told her he eats just fine with out it. Fuck her.\n\nI honestly think shes developing alzhemier\u2019s like her mother did or shes just becoming really lazy because when she does laundry, she barely puts the caps back on. The cap to the fabric softener was literally sitting on top of the bottle. She doesn\u2019t even fucking try.\n\nShe sent me three messages today:\n1. Confirming my therapist appointment\n2. Do the dishes\n3. Put the neighbors cat out (he slept in my room last night since it was snowing and he wouldn\u2019t leave)\n\nI tried to be as careful as I could when I phrased my message to tell her that she isn\u2019t putting the cap on securely. She got fucking defensive. She\u2019s so fucking immature. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to discuss what you think I should be doing. And I\u2019m at work so it\u2019s hard to discuss things that may need face to face.\u201d \n\nHalf an hour later: \u201cI hope nothing spilled on you.\u201d\n\nFuck you, you old saggy bitch. This isn\u2019t something that needs face to face. It\u2019s irresponsible and lazy to leave potentially harmful and extremely messy household substances open and unsecured. The mature option would have been to say something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019ll make sure the caps are on properly when I do laundry.\u201d But you chose to ignore it because you\u2019re so insecure, that you\u2019re offended when someone tells you when you\u2019re doing something wrong.\n\nI don\u2019t know what her problem is with me but she needs to get over herself. I think being around my sister has made her act funny. I don\u2019t know why she directs everything at me. My sister never has to do chores!!!!!! My brother does the dishes, cat litter and takes out the trash. I wash a lot of towels and I do the dishes occasionally but my sister does nothing. She works and does nothing at home. My brother works, goes to school and does chores. She doesn\u2019t do anything.\n\nI\u2019m trying not to respond to her. I feel its best to just leave it and wait to see my therapist, even then I don\u2019t know if its going to help. I want to freak out. I want to yell and scream at her and give her what for. I want to cut my wrists and arms. It\u2019s not like anyone is going to see it under long sleeves since its only going to get colder. I want to take overdose. I want to drink. I want to die so I don\u2019t have to deal with any of this.  I feel scared to tell my therapist because she might send me to the hospital again. If I tell her I feel like hurting myself, she legally has to. Every time I go, my mom gets upset and tries to make it about her. She tries to to change the mood from me wanting to hurt myself, to about how she feels about it. She doesn\u2019t want me to die, etc. but she never changes how she treats me. It always comes back to this. I can\u2019t keep going back to the hospital though. Maybe if I actually attempt something it might justify it. Like if insurance sees it or something. I\u2019m scared my therapist is going to make me go back.\n\nThis all fucking sucks. I wish I could just kill myself and end it so it would just stop. I wouldn\u2019t have to deal with anything.\n\nEdit: my parents and medical ppl are fucking lucky i threw away my fucking razors when i was feeling okay and good!!!!!!

I really thought I grew out of it. I can\u2019t remember my first relapse this year, I think I was drunk and sad. But this morning after manifesting an unnecessary argument with my ex (who is nothing but supportive and compassionate) because Im insecure and overwhelmed with my life right now.  He was the catalyst I sought to manifest this inner conflict. The argument peaked and when I left the conversation (which was over text, knowing full well texting is the worst way to confront someone, especially about something that isn\u2019t their problem) I relapsed and did things I hadn\u2019t done before. \nI bit myself, lightly but quickly and repetitively I poked my skin with a needle, then proceeded to scratch myself with a broken microscope slide cover.  I only ever scratched and cut never the other two. I feel like this break down was productive but I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll never learn how to handle emotional deregulation and self criticism when faced with the fact I messed up. I want to be a healthy positive person. One day I will be. If you have any advice on curtailing self harm as self punishment, I\u2019d love to hear it.

One of my favorite songs by them was \"Missing You\" because it had that sort of happy song/sad song vibe that I've always been a fan of. I remember plugging my phone into the AUX and playing the song for my mom because I liked it so much and I thought she'd like it too. I can't remember her words exactly, but she said something along the lines of \"It sounds like he's singing to one of those cutter girls.\" Keep in mind, this was before she found out I was self harming, but needless to say, I stopped listening to that song out of fear of her noticing something, even if I didn't think it was about self harm. While I was in the car today, I thought about that song, and thought \"Hey, I'm hurting myself again, let's bring back some repressed memories!\" So at a stop light, I searched it up on my phone and started playing it. It just sounded like a regular song that was just vaguely referencing any sort of bad habit. For whatever reason, when he sang:\n \"Make no mistake, The day will come when you can't cover up what you've done\"\nI just started fucking bawling my eyes out. I don't know why, I was just suddenly devastated all at once. I had to pull over for a good 15 minutes so I wouldn't crash my car lol. I don't know why it triggered such a strong reaction, by no means is this song some poetic, deep synopsis on self harm and relapse, but for some reason it just made me so emotional. I feel like a big baby for crying over a song, but I feel like I should share this anyways. I guess somehow the song made me feel a little less alone. I don't know. I feel terrible for 13 year old me. For locking myself up in my room for months and listening to sad songs while I cut my wrists with a rusty razor blade, pushing away any hope I managed to find, and playing it off when my sisters, and teachers would ask if I was okay. I guess I just now realised I'm back in that exact same situation, and I'm absolutely fucking terrified, because if history repeats itself, I know what's coming next, and the last thing I want to hear is my mom telling me I'm hurting myself for attention again.

But it did nothing to soothe the pain or relieve any pressure, it's not what I wanted to do or felt like I needed to do, the compromise didn't work. \n\nI ended up being found out the next day anyway so what was even the point of hiding it?\n\n\nNow we've had a couple of days of relative stability and I still hurt so much, I know I'm going to push him away if I keep feeling like this, but I can't help it.\n\nAnd he's going to be gone again tomorrow night.\n\nAnd I'm afraid I'm going to cave again.\n\n\nI'm afraid that I can't bring this up with him without sounding/feeling manipulative. I'm afraid that if I end up going through with it it's going to have the same effect. I'm afraid that he's already judging me harshly for my current indiscretion.\n\nIt's not like he's even doing anything wrong, I knew what the arrangement I was signing up for was, it never used to feel like this, I don't know what changed or why I can't just cheerfully go back to the way things were.\n\nI can feel myself becoming a person I hate and it doesn't feel like I can do anything to stop it.\n\nI just want to go back to feeling happy and believing in that bright future I saw ahead of me.\n\nI just don't want to keep feeling like this.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I know it\u2019s really dumb in hindsight, the whole reason I started, my long time bestfriend had been cutting herself ever since I met her two years before. So I wanted to help her stop, I told her for every cut she did I would double it, and if she was holding out on me it would be triple. Really I am a bad friend for trying to guilt her into stopping but it was the first time I was confronted about it, I cared about her more than anything else and I guess I don\u2019t have the best judgment calls at times. Long story short I got really into it. We called off the deal and have both been cutting ever since. Here and there it was a nice relief to have the pain to distract me from most of everything that was going on at the time. Shortly after I started I lost a close friend and a family member. Cutting really helped me through that, I\u2019m not sure how much further I would have gone without the outlet of cutting, it\u2019s cliche but having something so stigmatized as bad help you. It started to get worse my junior year, I would start to bring multiple razors and knives stashed in different spots. My two in my phone case, personal reading books, pencil cases, my locker, and my knife just stayed in my backpack. It made it really accessible for me to go to the bathroom or stand close to my locker and do it. Eventually I started to do it in class, under desks or inside my sweaters. Then one day my bestfriend tells me that someone had mentioned me in her class. We hung out frequently in her art teacher\u2019s class and the teacher asked her why I wasn\u2019t in the art class. She mentioned me by name, and another student who I had math with just blurts out \u201cOh the one who cuts themselves?\u201d My name isn\u2019t common, I think I am the only one at my school with my name. So all of these people now know that I cut myself. I had other friends in that class who didn\u2019t even know what was going on.  I was so embarrassed to have been so careless, I felt dumb and immediately felt like cutting again.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

There\u2019s religious guilt, fear of disappointing my boyfriend and parents, and of course, concern that my school will find out and that I\u2019ll be considered at-risk and treated accordingly. I know I don\u2019t want to kill myself, and deep down I think I know that I won\u2019t actually cut, but it\u2019s like I\u2019m obsessed with the idea of it. I\u2019m overwhelmed with the demands of work and the uncertainty of my future, and feel very little interest in what I\u2019m doing currently. So naturally, cutting seems appealing.

To be fascinated with the idea of cutting but to be paralyzed out of fear and not act on it?

It seems extreme, but I promise you its not. talking to someone REALLY helps, and with an easy platform like this, we can do that more easily and more effectively, with multiple people\n\nPart 3: conclusion\n\nthose of you who know what i post know im mostly for the meme, but this post was not made to be taken lightly. i seriously think a discord could be a valuable resource, and should at least be taken into consideration or a closed-ish beta.\n\nThis has been my TEDx Talk, thank you for your time\n\n\\-skele\n\nps/edit: if there is someone with a link, pls pm or something thx", "subreddit": "MadeOfStyrofoam"}

That's what I use. I have a razor, it just hasn't been used in a few days and I'm very meticulous with my secret pleasures. Or not so secret- the first time (tm) my dad said he and my mom would be very angry if they saw me hurting myself. It made me mad that they would be mad. Why mad?

About that. I've seen few but varying answers about razor safety. So that is my first question on here to go along with my first post. Just tell me what you think- how long can you go without using and it be safe to use again? How many times CAN you use it before disposal? For me, it was countless. but like I said, I am very safe. I do it as a reward, not as punishment. When I converted to razors, the difference in amount of blood was shocking. I do it without urge- if anything, preparing is somewhat a chore.

They both had some pretty bad mental health issues that they never discussed, and their parents weren\u2019t much help. The older brother started cutting soon after I met him, and I did everything in my power to get him through it. I would drop what I was doing and rush over so he wouldn\u2019t be alone, I spent all my free time around him, I listened to his feelings, everything to make him better. But our friendship soon turned into a toxic feedback loop where one of us would self harm, would go to the other for help, and then get the urge to cut again. Wash rinse repeat. This, on top of other bad parts of our friendship, made me cut ties. It was the best for both of us. \n\nTwo years later the younger brother comes to me saying he has the urge. I try to talk him out of it, explain that the coping mechanism turns into a strong addiction, and although he said it helped, he ended up cutting a few days later.\n\nApparently when the younger brother reached out to his dad so he could get the proper help he needed, the dad blamed each brothers self harm on me. Apparently the older brother got better soon after I cut ties. It really hurt to head, because in the back of my mind I did feel like it was partially my fault. Not that I encouraged it, quite the opposite, but that they saw I was doing it and thought it was ok. I feel awful for it. It seems a lot of people who come to me for help end up self harming in one way or another, and the worst part is that the scars I have will likely never fully fade, meaning people will always see that cutting was something that \u201chelped\u201d (HEAVY emphasis on the quotes) me.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

But either way this does come with a trigger warning, i go a little in depth on my SH, so if your not doing great and your likely to get triggered from what I say, then please, back out now and carry on scrolling reddit. :) \n\r\nI used to be doing so well.. Well over a year clean, from cutting anyway, all my scars had faded, I hardly saw them when I looked in the mirror, at last one of my dreams was becoming a reality, I always just saw my scars when I looked in the mirror. They were finally fading.. \n\r\nThen my life got turned up side down, and everything I had built over the past few years fell down around me in the space of a month, but I accepted it as something that needed to happen, accepted it was out with my control, that all I could focus on now was moving forward. \n\r\nOr so I thought.. Turns out I just pushed it all to one side, bottled it up and moved on with my life that stupid decision is now catching up with me.. I\u2019ve relapsed in to cutting, my legs and arms.. Worse than ever before, the stinging sensation I feel on my legs every morning, every time after sitting still for long, every time I place something on my lap.. A reminder of how far I\u2019ve fallen.. But worst of all, for me anyway.. I\u2019ve missed it.. The pain.. The blood.. I\u2019ve missed it so much.. At times I think my legs are blank canvas.. Made to be filled with cuts and scars.. In my whole life, as far as I can remember I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been this bad with my cutting.. \n\r\nThis time is different.. This time I want it.. I need it.. This time.. This time I want to die.. I want to take my own life.. But I\u2019m to bloody scared of death to actually do it.. So I\u2019ll be stuck in this loop for a long time..\n\r\nI feel alone.. I don\u2019t really have anyone I can turn to.. My mum.. Bless her for all her help, but she doesn\u2019t understand, I\u2019m her son.. So she\u2019s always going to take my side and stick up for me.. Even when I believe I\u2019m in the wrong.. I believe I\u2019m deserving of the pain I feel.. \n\r\nFriends? Yeah I guess.. I\u2019ve tried reaching out to a few, one of them I told that I\u2019m really not doing good and need to get out of the house for a few hours.. That was at the beginning of last week, not heard from them since they said they\u2019ll make time. \n\r\nAnother.. Just doesn\u2019t seem to care.. We\u2019ll be in an xbox party, he\u2019ll ask others how they\u2019re doing, never me.. He\u2019ll jump on with others when they need it.. But notmake time for me.\n\r\nI feel so alone.. Every day is the same.. Nothing to look forward to, nothing to get out of bed for.. The only think I look forward to is when I can have a spliff in the evening to escape my own head.. \n\r\nI want to die.. I really do.. But I\u2019m just too damn scared! So I guess I\u2019ll settle for cutting more.. \r\nThank you for reading, thank you for your time.. Its nice to know that I can come here and others will understand. \n\r\nI just wanna add that I am in therapy, might be an idea to push for more than one session a month.. Might be an idea to actually let my therapist in on how bad I\u2019m doing.. But I\u2019ve just not clicked with them yet.. So I\u2019m not comfortable doing it.. \n\r\nMy friends.. I\u2019m sure if I actually told them how bad I am.. But them it\u2019d just feel false. Idk.. Thank you again. \n\nPeace x", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Or maybe just something I wish I could tell a younger self. \n\nAs a late twenty-something who is a bit further down in their self-harm journey, I often reflect on the progress I've made to ground myself when I feel like I slipped back. I have been clean for a while now and off medication; however, a more serious self-harm urge came to mind during work. That and other symptoms of my anxiety that I know every well had been surfacing so right then and there I made an appointment with my doctor to get back on meds and contacted my therapist. I also reached out to three friends who know of my struggles, assured them that I am ok but that I've decided to start receiving professional help again. I am finally comfortable with actually following my care plan and being proactive instead of waiting for crisis. It's taken so much struggle and modification of my life to get here. Many days it still feels like shit, but I know that I am far away from my lowest points. \n\nI don't drink or smoke anymore despite it being legal for me now because I know that's a form of self-destruction for me. I try not to hate myself for leaving work on time or not taking work home because I know I can't pile on the stress. My mornings are modified because I know I have to drag my body out of bed. My bedtime is pretty strict too or else I'll stay up and ruminate on my trauma or find some other outlet for my more self-destructive tendencies. People text me regularly to check in and let me know I'm a good person. I kind of need it, and I try not to hate myself for needing it. I sometimes invite my friends over to help me do my chores, I hope they don't feel used. I don't take emotional abuse from my parents anymore and that is a journey that may continue forever. I'm basically a health guru on instagram with pics of my workout, diet, and mindfulness. I hope people take that as inspiration, as both my inspiration and my despair and is the fear that I'll fail. I hide my struggle in public because I want to be guy who got over their shit and is totally ok now. \n\nI can see the hospital from my window. Still, I have the fear that I'll find myself in that ER. But I'm far away from my past traumas. I'm far from my suicide attempt five years ago. I'm far from being dismissed from my job for coming in with fresh cuts. I'm far from my struggles to be an adult and get myself through grad school. I have a job in a field I'm passionate about. I can pay for a comfortable life. I have decent social support. And I'm glad I'm alive. \n\nSome days the urge to self-harm is so sweet. I'm not aiming to be clean forever, just for as long as I can. And that is good enough because soon enough it does get better.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

But if I tell him that I\u2019m thinking of self harming, he tries everything he can to stop me, and I end up self harming anyway, I know he would completely blame himself and feel like he has failed me. And as people who self harm I know a lot of you would agree with me that in most cases, nothing and no one can stop it from happening. So I don\u2019t want to tell him before. But I\u2019m afraid that if I don\u2019t then he will be mad and not feel like he can trust me anymore. And I don\u2019t want that easier. So basically, I need help figuring out what I could say to him to make him realize that nothing will stop me when I\u2019m past a certain point and also I need help figuring out when I should tell him about this stuff. Should I do what he asks and tell him before it ever happens and have him feel horrible when I cut (a long time ago after he watched a random video of someone self harming he couldn\u2019t sleep at all the whole night he just felt so empty so it effects him a lot especially because it\u2019s me) or should I wait until after and risk him not trusting me but he would feel less guilty.

I looked at him surprised. He didn\u2019t say anything , because he was hurrying to the other class, but this time he just stopped. It\u2019s as if he went completely numb for a moment. This \u2018stop\u2019 was only for 10-15 seconds, but to me it seemed endless. I could see the emptiness in his eyes. It broke my heart into pieces. He was shocked, and kept staring at my arm. His mouth was slightly open and his eyebrows frowned , slightly upwards. Then he went back to his pressure and hurry , realizing that he was probably late ; \u00ab Hello , Lapin...\u00bb as he ended his usual stare of his, he quickly turned away.\u00a0 \n\nBased on experiences I think he\u2019s going to talk about it in the coming days , knowing what type of person he is. I don\u2019t know how to react. It hurt me so hard seeing him like this. He\u2019s going to mention it soon, I know that. **He is the only person who truly took this seriously and cared**\n*( not to mention my parents laugh about my scars )*  And I appreciate him so much. \n\n*My good friend A.* \n\nShe  was shocked to see my scarred arm and started hugging me tight. She talked about it to me and was really nice. I appreciate that, I\u2019m extremely grateful for her presence.\u00a0\n\n*Other classmates and teachers *\n\nObviously I don\u2019t expect anybody to have any sort of eccentric reaction at such a minor thing related to me, but I my physics teacher kept looking without saying anything. Most of my classmates didn\u2019t react , many of them thought they were \u00ab\u00a0scratches from my cat\u00a0\u00bb or \u00ab\u00a0shark bites\u00a0\u00bb (okay, only the silly ones thought that) \n\nThere were some gossips about it from the \u2018pesky\u2019 kids, but I don\u2019t really care about it.\n\nOtherwise nobody really reacted (a relief to me).

During this stay they discovered that my 85 year old (like actually 85 years old, man is still working full time, wew) psychiatrist had been prescribing me all of my meds at dosages for someone like twice my size. I kept my benzo script because, yknow, overprescribed or not I'm addicted to benzos bc of my prescriptions so they couldn't just cut me off without risking ~seizures~ or ~death~ aka liability. But my anti depressant dose was lowered, and I'm at 1/3 of what I was taking before.\n\nThe lowered dose hit me HARD (it's wellbutrin, so not only was I dealing with the effects of the lowered dose, but I was also waaayyy more tired all the time combined with benzos = zombie). I continued cutting and it got so much worse. My fiance is (was?) so loving and supportive but it all came to a head when we were staying at my mom's house for the weekend and we got in an argument at like 2am and he just word-vomited all these thoughts he'd been suppressing about how he's sick of me cutting myself, he's sick of me losing my shit over the \"smallest things\" and a whole bunch of other really hard things to hear. I needed to hear em though. After that he went to sleep and naturally I coped by sneaking into the basement and making 4 quick n sleazy styros so I had to fucking wake him up to help me bandage them and he was so let down and disappointed - he didn't have to say it but I could see it in his eyes. That was Sunday, November 3rd at 2am, so basically Saturday night, 2 weeks ago, and it's the last time I cut.\n\nANYWAY fuck I gave a lot of backstory but here's my issue. I'm struggling with figuring out who I even am without self harm. I go to Walmart or Target and just ??? don't stop in the first aid section anymore ???? and I see my cuts healing (there are a lot from September and October and they've been taking forever to heal bc who has time for drinking water and vitamins lol) and I'm just panicking about it. I haven't done my usual ~self care~ routine which is staring at my fresh cuts for hours and then bandaging myself up and changing the bandage every day and I MISS IT. More than the act of self-harm itself. I miss my \"kit\" - I had a big one for home, and a small one for travel with like gauze and bandages and a mini version of my tool of choice. I feel like I don't know who I am without self harm so I've been obsessing over scar coverup tattoos and looking at other people's scars and talking to my one friend who \"gets it\" about cutting, in detail, just bc it's the closest thing I have to actually doing it.\n\nI am turning 27 in a month. I started when I was 13 and have been doing it on and off since then, usually with an increase in severity each relapse. I have two kids and it got so much fucking worse after they were born. They say your body changes after having a kid but my body went back to normal.... It's my brain that's broken. They're 7 and 5 so I can't call it postpartum depression. I'm too old for this shit, I'm someone's MOTHER for fucks sake. \n\nBut. I don't know who I am without self harm. \n\nThis 15 days feels like a lie. Like I've just been too lazy to do it and not like I'm really recovering.\n\nThere's nothing stopping me, I held onto everything, and it's all in a relatively accessible place.... but I don't wanna reset my stupid app lol why am I like this\n\nI don't think I'm gonna relapse, but there's definitely a chance I'll relapse. I just needed to say it\n\nThank you for reading especially if you read it all. I'm on adderall rn lmao so I ended up typing a lot.

{"post_id": "dycigo", "created_utc": 1574123847, "title": "Self-harm: an Overview and Alternatives", "author": "Sbeast", "self_text": "**Introduction**\n\nSelf-harm, or self-injury, is the intentional, direct injuring of your body. It is also sometimes calling self-mutilation or cutting. It is usually done as a way of dealing with painful feelings and memories, or difficult and overwhelming situations.\n\nPeople harm themselves in various ways, including cutting with a blade, burning, scratching, or striking body parts. Older definitions included excessive skin picking (dermatilliomania), and hair pulling (trichotillomania), but are now classified as different problems.\n\nThere is an increased risk of suicide in those who self-harm, and self-harm is found in 40-60% of suicides. The desire to self-harm is common in some personality disorders, particularly borderline personality disorder. It may also be a symptom of other mental health disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and dissociative disorders.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why people self-harm?**\n\nPeople may self-harm for various reasons, which include:\n\n* To express something that is difficult to put into words\n* To turn invisible thoughts and feelings into something visible\n* To change emotional pain into physical pain\n* To regain a sense of control\n* To punish yourself for feelings and experiences\n* To stop feeling numb, disconnected, or dissociated\n* To express suicidal feelings without taking their own life\n* To escape traumatic memories\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Tip 1: Emotional Literacy**\n\nBeing able to feel your emotions, accurately describe them, understand them, and communicate them to others is an invaluable life skill, and those who self-harm would greatly benefit from developing emotional literacy.\n\nAccording to Claude Steiner, \"to be emotionally literate is to be able to handle emotions in a way that improves your personal power and improves the quality of life around you.\"\n\nThe following three steps should allow you to begin to develop your emotional literacy:\n\n**1) Define** \\- What feeling or emotion am I experiencing right now? Say this out loud or write it down. (You can use this feelings wheel as a guide [http://feelingswheel.com](http://feelingswheel.com/))\n\n**2)** **Expand** \\- Begin to develop a more nuanced and detailed description of what you are currently feeling. Is it just sadness or is there fear as well? Is the anger mingled with fear? What is underneath the anxiety?\n\n**3)** **Action** \\- Write down a series of steps that may help you to avoid whatever caused you to feel this way, and begin to think about more healthy and mature ways to deal with, and express these feelings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Tip 2: Journaling**\n\nJournaling, or journal therapy is a writing based therapy that involves recording the writers internal experiences, thoughts and feelings. Through reflective writing, you may gain mental and emotional clarity, a deeper understanding of yourself, and be able to establish patterns of thought and behaviour over time.\n\nSome of the benefits of journaling include: better self-reported physical and emotional health, improved immune system, improved memory, reduced blood pressure, fewer stress-related doctor visits, improved mood and greater psychological well-being.\n\nBelow are some ideas on how to use journalling:\n\n**1) Intent** \\- At the start of the session, declare your intent on what you wish to achieve through writing.\n\n**2) Letter Writing** \\- Sometimes it can help to write a pretend letter. It could be directed towards anyone, including: someone who has wronged you in the past, a past relationship that never got full closure, or a deceased loved one.\n\n**3) Dialogue** \\- Through dialogue writer, you aim to explore multiple sides of a conversation about anything. This can help you to gain a clearer perspective on the subject, and also as away to develop empathy for others, by exploring their viewpoint.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Tip 3: Other ideas**\n\n* Snap a rubber band against your wrist\n* Find somewhere isolated and shout or scream\n* Use a red pen instead\n* Punch a cushion or punching bag\n* Exercise: circuit training, boxing, running, swimming\n* Take a shower or bath\n* Play your favourite music\n* Write a poem\n* Squeeze a stress ball\n* Skim stones on a lake\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Quotes**\n\n&gt;\"Don\u2019t make a permanent decision for your temporary emotion.\" \\~ Unknown  \n\"Unspeakable feelings need to find expression in words. However... verbalization of very intense feelings may be a difficult task.\" \\~ James A. Chu  \n\"Self-destructiveness may be a primary form of communication for those who do not yet have ways to tame their excruciating inner conflicts and feelings and who cannot yet turn to others for support.\" \\~ James A. Chu  \n\"If you spend your time hoping someone will suffer the consequences for what they did to your heart, then you're allowing them to hurt you a second time in your mind.\" \\~ Shannon L. Alder  \n\"Never forget that once upon a time, in an unguarded moment, you recognized yourself as a friend.\" \\~ Elizabeth Gilbert  \n\"Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping.\" \\~ Jordan B. Peterson  \n\"Self-harm - the world will come at you with knives anyway. You do not need to beat them to it.\" \\~ Caitlin Moran\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sources**\n\n[\\[1\\]](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/self-harm/about-self-harm/)\n\n[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-harm)", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Top of my class, perfect example of a perfect little Christian girl. Everyone loved me, I was popular, and the only flaw my teachers could ever find in me was that I talked too much. Up until fourth grade, that was just who I was; the perfect little girl with the perfect little life. But, as you can probably tell, things changed. \nIn the summer of, I think 2014, my boppa committed suicide. That sucked. Once my school year started, my mom was having horrible periods, and, upon inspection, she was found to have breast cancer. At the time, all I knew was that it was bad and she would need surgery. Luckily, said surgery went well &amp; they removed all the tumors (or so they thought). For a few years everything was fine. \nIn those few years, one of my best friends came out to the group as a lesbian. I knew that was gay and gay was bad so I tried to distance myself from her. Until I began to realize that I was a huge ass homo myself, that is. (Honestly little me, imagining other girls naked is not straight behavior!) So, on top of my boppa killing himself and my mother having cancer, I was painfully aware of the fact that I was a gay in a family of very homophobic Christians. I scratched my leg to see if it would be any relief but it wasn't, so I didn't do it again. By seventh grade, my mom had some back pains but she thought nothing of it until it got worse. \n\nWhen she finally went to get it checked, she was told what little bit of tumor they missed had spread to her bones. They gave her treatments which promptly stopped working, hell, they even tried an experimental treatment but it all failed and once it spread to her vital organs her health declined exponentially and she was gone about a month into my eighth grade year.\nEighth grade was hell, I was suicidal, barely did much of anything, my only reliefs were the school musicals I took part in (I was Ursula in the little mermaid and by god that was fun). I also tried to date a guy to see if I could un-gay myself, and subsequently ruined someone else's mental health because he had liked me for forever and I had to break up with him because, well, I am very much a lesbian. I passed eighth grade most likely just riding on people's pity of the kid whose mom died. Fast forward to freshmen year, my grades are never above a C, my family is disappointed in me, I still haven't come out to any of my family, but I have found some relief in cutting/scratching my thighs. \n\nThat was long af and I guarantee no one's going to read the whole thing but I said it and now at least someone knows.\n\n\n(I did come out to one of my more homophobic cousins via gay joke but that's a whole nother story)", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I don\u2019t like telling the people I trust about it because the last time I did, they told me it was childish and to grow up because it\u2019s just a middle school relationship. The reason I started was because of this girl Cadence. I\u2019ve always tried to put on this bad boy persona because I know how easily someone can break me. Me and Cadence started dating in December 2018 and everything was all good until March. She started to make me feel useless, like I don\u2019t matter, and that I\u2019m not enough. It got worse as time went on. I started to feel like I didn\u2019t deserve anything, I also stopped eating a lot because I felt like I didn\u2019t deserve food. In May I started to cut because it made me feel better, because at that time all I felt was nothing. I felt emptiness. And then in August I tried to tell her about how she made me feel, I told her about the cuts and that I stopped eating because of her. All she told me was that I\u2019m toxic and that she won\u2019t change how she acts and that maybe I made myself think she did all those things. It really hurt me to hear that but I didn\u2019t know what to do. I tried to push it aside and forget about everything. And then in October I was starting to get better until one day I was alone and everything just came back to me, and I\u2019ve been cutting ever since. All I feel is that I\u2019m useless and that I don\u2019t deserve anything that I have.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Some shit\u2019s gone on in my life, and I\u2019ve ended up blaming myself for all of it, and that among what feels like far too many reasons is why I\u2019ve started.\n\nI\u2019m in sixth grade, and I have three very close friends. Similarly to me, one once tried to take some pills to kill herself. The other was nearly anorexic in fourth grade due to his verbally abusive parents. The last one who we\u2019ll call Ace since it\u2019s important, was almost abandoned when he was three, and his parents are in a very unhealthy relationship.\n\nToday, Ace, who is a mere ten years old, cut himself for the very first time. He confessed it to me, and none of our other friends. He told me he did it with a pen, in his room last night. Ace said that the ink got everywhere, so he went to wash it off and his mom say. All his mom said was for him not to do it again- and now he blames himself even more for her depression, plus his autistic little brother\u2019s unhappiness. He showed me the scar in one of our periods, and it was pretty bad. A little less than an inch long. It didn\u2019t look too deep, unfortunately, but I made scars like that on my arm once too and they\u2019re still there, even after two full years. \n\nI don\u2019t want him to hurt. Seeing his just recently opened scar made me realize how much I hated myself and cared for everyone else. I\u2019m perfectly fine with doing the exact same thing he did but much larger, much deeper, and with a knife, but I can\u2019t stand it when he does it. When he told me in the morning before school, I damn near had a breakdown. He\u2019s gone through a lot and I can\u2019t stand him hurting- I don\u2019t want him to end up like em. He\u2019s so young, he\u2019s only ten. He can\u2019t end up like me- I can\u2019t allow it. I\u2019m a failure of a friend and I\u2019m most likely only going to cut deeper because of it.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. It was his first cut, I believe- a beginner\u2019s mistake is making it on the arm, especially for where I live. I just did the same not much less than a week ago because I couldn\u2019t stand it (I fantasize about cutting my arms a lot- the gore excites me. Finally gave in about a week ago and convinced my mom that it happened in gym class), but I never imagined that something would happen to him.\n\nHow do I help Ace? I\u2019ve already told my two other friends and we\u2019re going to talk with him tomorrow morning, but is there anything more we can do? We don\u2019t want to tell the school about him (the two friends that aren\u2019t Ace already did that for me and now I\u2019m in school counseling- they feel guilty as hell over it and I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m still a bit mad at them), especially because of his parents.

The thing that really threw me off was how deep they were. I assumed they would be shallow but now I\u2019m worried that he\u2019s been doing this for longer than I thought. Maybe I\u2019m making to many assumptions but I\u2019m so fucking afraid he\u2019s going to end up like me. I had him read a post of mine from a while back that was a letter to people who had just started self harming. I hope it helped because I honestly don\u2019t know how to help him.

My parents were at some point angry at me for it because if people saw them, they would be portrayed as bad parents (which of course they could never be, haha), so I moved it to places where it couldn't be spotted.

I've never felt comfortable sharing this because of judgement.\n\nI have a problem with becoming angry at myself and closed-fist punching myself in the side of the head and face. I have Bipolar II and ADHD with a history of physical abuse as a child, I'm now 30 years old. I confuse easily when performing single tasks, with the feelings of worthlessness and ineptitude triggering an immense frustration with myself over time that eventually explodes into striking myself over and over. I've left nothing more than small bruises and bumps, mostly all hidden in my hair. Last week, however, my anger peaked when I hit my right side so hard that my cheek swelled up and turned purple immediately. This injury evolved into a bad black eye, along with a bruise on the cheek. All week, I've looked like I lost the worst fight. I always feel like I deserve it in those moments.\n\nI don't know how to stop doing this, how to control my anger when it surges the way it does. I used to do it as a kid, but stopped almost two decades ago, suddenly I can't help but do it again? It's bad enough that I had to explain this to my wife and watch her cry in her worry for me. Any advice would be very helpful. \n\nTLDR: Frustration with myself and mental illness leads me to punch my own face, it's now so bad that I'm giving myself black eyes.

My first attempt was in middle school and that failed pretty badly. I remember looking at myself in the mirror and thinking, \u201cWhat the hell am I doing to myself?\u201d\n\nFast forward to my junior year of high school and things went really bad. One of the worst years of my life. I remember having glass decorations in my room that I\u2019d smash just to have something to do the deed with. Then I\u2019d throw it away because I\u2019d tell myself that I would stop. I wasn\u2019t very interested in hiding the scars. I thought I did good at waiting for the cuts to heal then cutting the same spots again so when people look, there\u2019s only the same scars they\u2019ve seen before. It made it easier to lie about the cause by making the locations consistent.\n\nI stopped during my senior year. But then a year later at around 19-20, I started again. It was bad. I had no urge to stop. No will to get better. I branched out. No longer just the same places, but all over. Thighs, both arms, the palms of my hands. It kept going until I wanted to do better and be better because I didn\u2019t want to have kids one day with my then boyfriend, now husband, and have them see that mommy doesn\u2019t love herself. What kind of message would I send to them?\n\nI did good for a year. I saw a therapist. Talk therapy helped, but I abandoned therapy when she started branching into hypnotherapy. I felt uncomfortable and logically, I should\u2019ve said something, but I kept pretending everything was okay. I regret it every day.\n\nNow, I\u2019m much better. I don\u2019t hurt myself as badly or nearly as often as before. It\u2019s been 3 months since I\u2019ve hurt myself. Even then, I only just pinched myself so hard that I broke skin. But when those moods hit, it\u2019s so hard to stop myself.\n\nMy husband thinks I\u2019m better. I would tell him how it really is, but I don\u2019t want to be babied. I don\u2019t want to be watched over. I want to be an adult who can have control over themselves. That\u2019s why I started harming myself in the first place. The control. He\u2019s always been really supportive though. He would kiss my scars and call in and check up on me if I wasn\u2019t feeling like I was in the right place. I may not be able to tell him that I struggle with this addiction, but I can always talk to him about feeling down or having a bad mental health day and he will ALWAYS step up to the plate and brighten my day as best as he can. But I don\u2019t know how to explain to someone who isn\u2019t like this that it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s addictive. It\u2019s more than just a bad habit you can drop. It feels like I\u2019m wired to be this way. No matter how far I go from it, I always seem to backtrack to it again. Even when I\u2019m happy, I find myself missing the feeling of healing scars being rubbed against my clothing. I miss it and I know I shouldn\u2019t.

I've hh only been cutting for a month maybe and I'm just worried about them getting infected I guess? That's the reason I'm making this post for, just read like the last paragraph to skip my rant. I.. kind of describe how I do it. Just so hopefully I can get advice??? If it's not allowed I'm sorry. I don't mean to be disrespectful in any way jfnskdf\n\nI'm telling yall this stuff because I don't trust anyone close to me and I'm just.. scared? This is going to be worded bad, I'm sorry, I just wanna kinda throw this all up and get it out there. \nUh, I cut my stomach from like my hip to below belly button bc I never really show skin anyway and I wear one piece swim suits? We have this like huge pack of blades, the kind where you can snap them off once they get dull. There's like 50 or so so I was able to take one without anyone noticing. I've always wanted to do this I guess uh I always felt like the pain would be nice? Ive always kinda subtly did things like bite my lip until it bleeds or touch a pan that was still a little too hot, stuff like that. I was always so scared to actually cut because my mom gives like no privacy lol and I didn't know how to hide it. \nBut the other day though I just got curious I guess and looked at these forums and stuff in incognito. I was home alone too and.. I just decided to go with it? I got one of the blade things and I washed it off and I just kinda sat on the couch and.. did it. I was so scared at first but after the first cut I realized it was ok. And I liked seeing the blood ig. I did that for a couple minutes and I'd just let myself kinda feel it sting and eventually I got up and went to the bathroom. I wiped the blood up with dry toilet paper first and then took wet and carefully wiped any dry bits, if that makes sense. I washed the blade with just water and I stored it with my xacto knife kit. Figured that'd be the least suspicious if anyone found it? I just did that for a bit, I washed it with just water and put it back in, until I realized wow ok rust exists ksbJxbf so I threw away the rusty blade (in my bathroom trashcan, I wrapped it in tp first), and I needed another plan. So I got a new one and now I store it in between two Band-Aids and in the back of a canvas painting above my bed. \nThere wasn't really a point for writing all of that I just felt like I had to kNdjznzjf\n\n\nOk so I'm just worried about the cuts getting infected? I want to do this as.. responsibly? as I can. I don't really have access to much exept water, tissue, and Band-Aids. I can't go out and buy anything else to help, I'm too young lmao, and asking for it would be weird. \nI wash the blade with water before and after I cut, and I make sure to let it dry so it won't get rusty. And I use toilet paper to soak up the blood and try to kinda wash the cuts, again with tap water. Then I just put my shirt over them and hope that the blood stopped ig. Oh also I took a bath right after I cut the other day, I'm wondering if that's safe? djznkdb\n\nThanks for your time. Also, I know this is bad, and I really shouldn't have started, all that stuff. I know this is a huge deal and.. I don't know. I'm just asking for advice on how to at least do it as safely as possible. Thanks thanks.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

That doesn't change what an asshole she's been to [people].\" That's verbatim besides names at the end. \n\nIn addition, Leo's telling me not to try so hard to help this \"toxic\" person because my mental health degrading a little bit isn't worth saving Bea's life. I don't agree at all.

But over the past year I\u2019ve been so busy with uni and I\u2019ve never actually had the time to feel my emotions, to be alone with my thoughts and have nothing else distract me. But I\u2019m finally on break, and I will be for the next 2 months and my mind has just started doing the shitty mental self hate thing. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s something that\u2019s normal? I mean I\u2019ll find myself sitting alone, all perfectly fine one minute then the next minute I\u2019m crying and cussing myself out of every single fucked up decision or failure I\u2019ve made. I only managed to stay clean for about 3 years because my ex boyfriend threatened to hurt himself if he saw me self harm, and so I didn\u2019t. But after we broke up I realized that I didn\u2019t have to stay clean anymore. And so I\u2019d hurt myself every now and then. My current bf doesn\u2019t really stop me because despite his attempts to talk me out of it, I\u2019m able to pursued him into allowing me to do it anyway. Tonight has been rough, the past fucking week has been rough and my mom got sick and I had to deal with that shit like I\u2019ve always done since my dad died. The pressure and weight of carrying everything on my shoulders gets to me so fucking much and I can\u2019t help but need to let out some of my frustration on myself. So I fucking cut myself tonight, like an hour ago to be precise. I feel like shit, I was crying and I lashed out at my bf and he\u2019s confused by why I\u2019m upset and simply went to bed. I wanna tell him that the voices I used to have are back and they\u2019re getting bad again but fuck, do I? Do I really want help? 25. Ive got till 25 to fucking kill myself and one day I will finally build up the fucking courage to buy the rope and do it. No more failed attempts, no more sissy fucking self harm cuts that people will label as attention seeking, one day when I\u2019m fucking dead everything will finally be okay. \n\n(I\u2019ve posted on here before, but I made a new acc bc of privacy, also sorry for my shitty grammar, it\u2019s 3am and my brain is hazy)", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I know you know my reddit username, and I know you lurk on this subreddit and r/SelfHarmScars . If you want to continue, do so. I wont mention your name, or anything about you. I just dont want you to worry about me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a long read, but I'd appreciate if you read it all.\n\nI was at a sleepover yesterday with a very close friend, who i'll call Alyssa. and my girlfriend, who ill call Natalie. Natalie had started self harming, and was about 2 weeks clean until something very triggering happened. (I will not tell what happened because it really was triggering) She relapsed that day. She carved \"stupid asshole\" onto her thigh. She said it wasn't that bad, but just the fact that she hurt enough to do that is really fucking terrible.\n\nI have been self harming for about a year now. Recently, my cuts have gotten to fat. I have 3 fat cuts on my left arm, and 3 distributed between both my legs. I brought a tshirt and shorts to wear for pajamas to the sleepover. We were talking about our scars, and Alyssa doesn't self harm, so she didn't really contribute to the conversation. Except for when I showed my body. Alyssa made it seem like I self harm only because Natalie does. Keep in mind, we both had very traumatic childhoods, and that is a factor in both our self harm, more so hers than mine. \n\nAlyssa kept implying that I was doing it just for attention. It made me quite mad, but I don't show anger that much. It was still quite hurtful. After an hour or so, I called my sister, who was hanging out with one of her friends. I told her the story of what happened. How I broke down crying when I heard about Natalie's relapse. How Alyssa implied that I was doing it for attention. How Alyssa's brothers kept coming in the room and staring at my body. I told her all of it. She called my dad to come pick me up, so he did. Natalie and Alyssa were begging me to stay at the sleepover since we haven't had a sleepover just the three of us in over a year. I wanted to stay, but I just couldn't mentally deal with it. \n\nWhen my dad came to Alyssa's house, Alyssa walked me outside. Natalie stayed in the house, not really talking to anyone.  Just staring at her phone. She does that when shes kinda pissed or sad. I think she was a mixture of both right then. I got in my dads car and told Alyssa that I would text in our group chat why I didn't want to stay. When I got home, I did that. Alyssa replied, but Natalie didn't. Alyssa said that she was still kinda sad, so she told her why I didn't want to stay. She understood... I think. \n\nAfter I texted them, I stayed up on my computer feeling like shit. Somehow I didn't self harm. I went to bed shortly after midnight. I wear short sleeves and shorts to bed. Since I was just exhausted, I slept until about noon. That's when my mom woke me up and told me to get ready for my cousins birthday party. She tried to shift the covers to see something on my mattress, and my arm was visible for a second or so. The one that was recent was covered by a bandaid, and the others were scabbed over and healing. She told me to show her my arm. And after a minute or so, I did. She asked what I did it with, and I told her the razors in my backpack. She searched through my backpack and found them, and took them. Although I have others in my dresser drawers that I didn't tell her about. \n\nAfter she left my room, she told my dad. They thought I'd been clean since October 20th or so. They're both treating me different now. I ended up not going to my cousins birthday party, and I feel like shit about that. I don't know what to do now. If they see my legs were the cuts are deeper, they might do something kinda drastic. I'm fucking scared now. I don't want them to pity me. It would be better without them knowing. I just put extra stress on them. \n\nTL;DR: I was at a sleepover and I felt like shit, so I went home. My mom saw my self harm on my arm the next morning and told my dad. Now they're both pitying me.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

And she has other friends that she always texts and hangs out with and I guess it just makes me feel inferior so I'm sort of angry at her (which I know is petty af).

I had posted something on my twitter about being on a good clean streak without thinking \"oh hey someone might ask what you mean\" because... I have no braincells.. And my parents were really proud of me for the first time in a long time, so I was kinda blinded by my feelings too. Anyway, he asks me what's up underneath the post and I tell him to slide in those dms.\n\nOnce we're in direct messages, I try and stall. He recognizes this, and starts comforting me... which... ugh. He's actually so sweet. He wants to be a psychologist, and damn he would be a good one.\n\nBut once I get it out... He's really nice about it, saying that he's proud of me and that if I ever need to talk about something, that he's here for me. Then we continue having a normal conversation.\n\nThe night after that, I get a dm from my friend \"A\" saying that she saw my tweet. She asks me what I meant and if everything was okay. With her, it was a lot easier since I knew her better than T, and I knew that she's also one of the nicest people you could meet. I also assumed that since it was 11:40ish at night, she would be asleep. (She sent it at 6ish, and my sleep schedule is all over the place, so I was asleep and didn't see it right away)\n\nSo I pretty much just up and said it, telling her not to worry and that I'm getting help (because well... I am) and again, she's super nice about it. I'm not suprised but I think I can speak for all of us when I say that telling people you self harm is nerve racking no matter who it is.\n\nAnyway, she responded, and told me how proud she was, how much she cared about me, how much everyone else cared about me, sent me resources, told me she was here for me... and ugh, again, my heart melted.\n\nI literally never imagined I would tell some of my friends, and that it would go over all that well, even if they were super nice. I had assumed it would end in some crappy argument, but it didn't.\n\nNeedless to say, I feel blessed for my friends.

Long explanation up ahead, but long story short, I am okay, my dad handled it very well and my mother is starting to come around. I do not know if I am going to press charges yet. \n\nWhat I didn\u2019t mention in that post (as it wasn\u2019t necessary at the time) was that my abuser is my stepfather, and he is (was?) still together with my mom. \n\nI decided first to tell my dad, as I knew my father would handle it better and understand easier. He took it very well and is handling this situation very calmly. We sat down and talked for a long time about it, and we decided that he would tell my mother to come over that night and he would tell her everything that had happened. This was on Wednesday. After my mother came over and my parents talked for a bit, my dad asked me to come and speak with her. To sum up our conversation, she said \u201cyou think you\u2019re grown up now, you don\u2019t need me, I\u2019m going to kill myself (she really drove home the suicide thing), let me talk to your stepdad and sort things out, you are my whole heart, but I still love him a little bit.\u201d Frankly, that hurt so fucking badly. Who chooses a man who has cheated on them over their own daughter?\n\nThe next day (Thursday), she texted me paragraphs upon paragraphs about how I have to forgive him, how she\u2019s broke and has no money and if I press charges she\u2019ll lose everything she has, and about how I should feel sorry for his poor mother in Guatemala. I don\u2019t give a single fuck about his mother, you manipulative fucks. \n\nMy mother called me on Friday and said to me, \u201cI\u2019ll come over on Sunday and take you out to eat, and on Wednesday we can go to the mall and go shopping.\u201d She said this all to me one day after telling me how poor she is. Last night (Saturday), my dad had her come over and explain to her that this can\u2019t work, you can\u2019t fix this man, and I don\u2019t want to spend her money that she doesn\u2019t have. She said that she had kicked him out, and that he would agree to help pay the mortgage (they had just bought a new house together) and stay away from us, but to please not press charges because otherwise she loses the house and has nowhere to go. \n\nI really don\u2019t know what to do now. I don\u2019t want my mother\u2019s life to be ruined, and frankly I don\u2019t want to go through the process of pressing charges, but I have no way of knowing if he\u2019ll hold up his end of the bargain. \n\nThank you to everyone who wished me luck on my last post, you all gave me the extra courage I needed that day. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ll go from here, but I\u2019ll figure things out.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Let me start by saying I'm relieved to have found a community of people who go through the same thing as me. Self harm has always filled me with a sense of shame and I've never felt like I could really talk about it even with my friends who were aware that I've struggled with it in the past. \n\n     Something I've always felt but never been able to vocalize without shame has been eating away at me again so this seems like a good place to share. I am weirdly attached to my scars. It was my fascination with scars that first brought me to self harm. When I was 12 there was a girl a few years older than me who showed me her self harm scars one day. She had cut flowers and swirls and other designs in her arm. I was fascinated. Stupid me thought I would give it a try since she seemed to like it so much and it was a spiral from there. I immediately realized that cutting gave me a sense of control that I lacked in my life and I quickly became addicted. Since then it's been on and off for 10 years.\n\n      In the periods when I'm not actively self harming I get this insane sense of anxiety when I notice my scars are fading and I feel like such a piece of shit for feeling that way. I mean I should be happy that they're going away, right? But instead I panic. I think it's because it makes me feel like I'm losing control in my life again and the result is usually a relapse. The weird part is it's not like I'm proud of the scars, you know? I hide them at all costs from other people. But still, when I see them going away I just lose it. Does anyone else feel like this?

I\u2019m just another whiney teen who thinks they\u2019re depressed. The kind of person my friends hate. I wonder if they talk about me like they talk about all of the other \u201cfakes\u201d. Will they hate me for it?\n\nAnd once i started, I didn\u2019t even want to show people. It was \u201ctoo soon\u201d. They\u2019re not bad yet, they\u2019ll just think it\u2019s pathetic. I\u2019ll just be whining about my mental illness when it\u2019s really nothing. \n\nAnd if anyone but my close friends knew, they\u2019d just think, \u201cOh look at her. I knew she was depressed. It was only a matter of time before she started.\u201d They think I\u2019m an idiot. They thought I didn\u2019t speak English for years. Now they think I\u2019m dumb because my social anxiety is so bad I can\u2019t answer questions in class without having a panic attack.\n\nIf my mom finds out she\u2019ll get me help. I don\u2019t want that. I don\u2019t want to stop. It\u2019s the only thing that makes me feel normal. I also hate therapy. I had a therapist but she acted like, \u201cLet\u2019s see what this bitch has made up today.\u201d It was like she thought I was funny. Granted, I was 11. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t know how to put my feelings into words, and even if I did I wouldn\u2019t say them in person.\n\nNow I have the school counselor but she seems more like a friend. I don\u2019t want to tell her anything because I don\u2019t want to hurt her. She never asks anything about my mental health. I go with my friends so she just talks to them.\n\nIf my brother found out I don\u2019t know what he\u2019d say. He hates me being hurt. He has a bad history with self harm so I don\u2019t want him to know what I\u2019m going through. I don\u2019t want to hurt him.\n\nI can tell my friends, but only because they don\u2019t take mental health seriously. They all cut so it\u2019s nothing new. It\u2019s nothing new. When my friend found my blades, she didn\u2019t ask if I was ok, she said, \u201cThese are exactly what I use.\u201d\n\nSo I feel like I\u2019m not really mentally ill. Still.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Don't cut too deep.\n\nBut soon you won't know the difference between not cutting too deep and not cutting deep enough.\n\nSoon, it'll be all you can think about, all you want to think about. When things go wrong or you have a bad day or, frankly, get bored, the thought of when you can next dig that metal into your skin, feel the pinch and release, and watch that blood pooling in the wound will occupy every space in your mind. You'll have wounds on your body that will catch on your clothes. You won't be able to go swimming and trust me you'll miss it. It'll sting in the shower. Oh god it'll sting, and then you'll end up needing more. It's an addiction and should be treated as seriously as drug additions.\n\nAt first, you'll be using small time blades, and barely pressing in. It'll provide the pain and release you need. But then it won't. Then you'll get curious about how far you can take it. Or you'll need more and more just to get through the day. Then you're left with scars you didn't know you had because you were always cutting over them. You'll end up with a body that looks like mine, and a constant reminder of the worst time in your life.\n\nSo don't pick up that blade or the lighter or whatever creative method you think you've come up with. Not unless you want to remember this time for the rest of your life. Not unless you want to be stuck with this feeling, unable to ever fully move on because the reminders are always with you. Not unless you want to be paralysed with shame and fear at people finding out about it.\n\nInstead, exercise. Exercise so hard it hurts and you're practically collapsing with exhaustion.\n\nSqueeze ice until you can't feel your fingers.\n\nEat the ice. Chow down on that until you get brain freeze.\n\nScream into a pillow. Cry until your stomach hurts and you don't think you'll ever cry again. Then cry some more.\n\nThen, if you really want to hurt yourself, if you really want to do something that's gonna be so tough you'll hate every minute, pick yourself back up. Fight your way out of that place, kicking and screaming. Tire yourself out with the effort and then keep going. Fake it if you have to. Keep trying to live even when it hurts, especially when it hurts, and above all else, smile. Trust me, that's gonna hurt. That's gonna hurt like hell.

It\u2019s been 3 days I\u2019m crying non stop because I really try to not do it again but it\u2019s so fucking hard... \n\nShe eventually apologized, saying she didn\u2019t remember it. I hate it. I\u2019m sorry, but I know she just wants attention. She\u2019s the one that has everyone on her side to support her while I\u2019m crying non stop and no one notices it. \n\nI know that if I cut again, someone would notice it and then would be angry at me, I\u2019m scared, but in the same time too tempted to do it... \n\nI really tried everything, draw on my arms, draw, play piano, walk outside, watch videos, I really tried everything in my power but I just can\u2019t get this out of my head. It\u2019s been three weeks now and... and I might do something bad tonight if I don\u2019t find anything to calm down... \n\nAny tips or ideas ?..", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I love makeup because I can make my face look not horrendous, I love fashion because I look for clothes that hide my body. \n\nI can\u2019t talk on the phone even to my family because I get all panicky and that\u2019s ten times worse if it\u2019s a stranger. I need to get a job desperately and I really want to make that happen but I because the whole idea of walking into a place and I don\u2019t know a single face is terrifying. \n\nI\u2019m trying so hard and it\u2019s either not enough or no one gives a shit. \n\nSorry again for the rant, I\u2019m just feeling really alone right now and I don\u2019t know what else to do.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

She would even try to move in odd positions to see my arms. I ended up putting my jacket on and she was visibly angry??? Whatever. Not my problem but just makes me angry. Also a customer told me when I was ringing them up \"you dont have to hurt yourself like that. It gets better I promise\" in a really cheery voice.

I\u2019ve been depressed in the passed and I\u2019ve had moments in my life where I\u2019ve been extremely sad and felt useless and worthless. I\u2019ve however never had the thought of self harm though. Im just very surprised to see such a large community of people who are in the habit of self harm. I\u2019ve got so many questions running through my mind and would like to ask them.\nI\u2019ve noticed that a lot of people on this subreddit are also teenagers. Some of my questions may be brutally honest and quite straight forward so I hope I don\u2019t offend anyone, but I genuinely what to wrap my head around what\u2019s going on here.\n\nMy first question is, what is it that makes you harm yourself? \n\nWhat is the best way to help someone and lead them in the direction of not harming themselves?\n\nWhat is your agenda behind harming yourself? Do you just intend to just feel pain? Or do you have suicidal intentions? \n\nDo you think that harming yourself makes things better? \n\nI\u2019ve noticed that some people are addicted to self harm and find it hard to stop. Do you people self harm on a regular basis even when not feeling sad? \n\nThis is a brutally honest question, but do you self harm for the attention and the the sympathy of others? Maybe that could be what\u2019s addicting about it? \n\nI\u2019ve read in one of the posts that a girl just broke up with her boyfriend so she mad made the decision to cut herself. My question is why? What does that prove? What does that solve? What is the intention behind it? Is your body and your life worth harming for the sake of having a break up? \n\nAgain I would like to emphasise that my words may sound very unempathetic, very rude, very straight forward and very misguided. I don\u2019t mean to be any of those things whatsoever and I understand that everyone has the right to live the way they want to live and do what they please with their own lives.

Well, sadly my useless and worthless dumbass misjudged the fall and I survived. My friends found my unconscious body about an hour after I jumped down.

I didn't expect to survive.\" But I just decided to apologize and say I was distracted and fell down.

I have eye for detail when it comes to appearance and behaviour and notice things like that very easily. She initially had cuts on top her forearm and on the side of her hand near her thumb. As you usually see people cutting their wrists I didn't immediately think it was sh. I asked her what those scratches were on her arm and she brushed it off and said the cat did it, I often get scratches from our cats but I decided to try and keep an eye on it. It definitely looked very different from cat scratches. Since then I have been trying to get a look almost every day and I noticed that she really tries to hide it, when eating dinner she only has one arm above the table, the other hidden underneath it. She keeps her hair long to cover it when wearing a shirt and keeps her arm and in such a position that you can't really see it or puts it behind her back or twisted. She wears sweaters whenever she can. She put a bandaid over it when going to prom. My parents don't notice stuff like this so after a few days I had told my mom and I think she didn't know what to do because she only told my sister to stop doing it, which is obviously not going to work. Fast forward a little bit, this summer she didn't have any fresh cuts, only scars left. I thought she was doing better but still kept trying to catch a glimpse of the spot every single day and keep an eye on it. As it's cold here, she has been wearing sweaters again so I couldn't see it anymore. But then it happened again, yesterday she was wearing a pajama shirt and while she was holding our cat so I could get a tick off of her I saw very obvious new cuts in the same spot. They were very red but I couldn't see it for long enough to see how many, how deep etc. I know I shouldn't do this but I looked around in her room and found several bloodied tissues in her trashcan, one completely soaked. My family doesn't really talk about sensitive stuff like this and my sister is very introverted and I just know she would hate having to talk about this and she definitely wouldn't open up. I don't know who to tell, how to get help.... Do I tell my mom that she started again and convince her to seek help from maybe a therapist or something?? I don't think she's suicidal as she cuts in a spot where there's mostly fat, no big or important veins but I guess she's depressed?

I'm usually very careful about how I good my arms and everything but I was talking with my hands and she noticed after a few minutes. She asked what was on my arm and I tried to brush it off but she asked to see my arm and I had to show her. She saw like 2 week old cig burns. She works in law enforcement and I was afraid she would think it was track marks but she immediately asked if they were cig burns. I told her that they were and all she said was that I should stop hurting myself and then she let it go. I know that she would be supportive and help me but I'm not used to having people that care about me so I'm trying to figure out if I should try discussing it more with her and my uncle or not. I also have fucked my thigh up pretty bad so I'm trying to make sure to hide it. But since I'm moving in with them soon there is a chance they will see it anyways. I'm trying to figure out if I should just come clean now or try to hide it but idk if they will get upset or worried if they find them in the future. She hasn't brought it up again and idk if she has told my uncle. So should I just keep working damage control or talk to them. The other thing is idk if I can stop or if I even want to stop. \n\nJust looking for some outside advice. If you took the time to read this, thank you.

I had a dermatologist check them out and she said ive done well that they're not keloidal, but the problem is they've faded to white and I have brown skin so in certain light they really stand out. \n\nI have always been proud of my legs and loved wearing short shorts and skirts, so now I end up slightly hating myself every time I attempt to get dressed and see those terrible words staring back at me.\n\nI've gotten both Palmers skin therapy oil and bio oil, but i think its just to make myself feel better, neither of them seem to actually do anything to fade the scars. \n\nIt's getting to a point where I'm thinking of just cutting over them again, just so I don't see the words anymore. But i dont want to relapse. \n\nHow have you guys dealt with scars like this? How did you accept the scars that wouldn't fade, especially when they're hurtful words?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. Thank you", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I don\u2019t know if he knows for sure that it was self harm.\n\nI have cut too deep for comfort quite a few times, sometimes I panic, with fresh razors it is very easy to use too much pressure, and I cut a little above my wrists in a very dangerous spot.

Point is, it doesn\u2019t last too long and my cuts aren\u2019t deep so I\u2019ve come to terms with it but afterwards looking at my scars always brings a lot of shame and disappointment that this is who I\u2019ve become. My bf (of three months) knows, and recently (this week) it started again. I told him after I cut the first time and the past two nights every time I felt like doing it/after I do it. This has happened twice. It\u2019s happening currently as well but this would be the third night in a row. Surely he needs a mental break from me. He also told me earlier today about how tired he was because he had trouble sleeping last night and he cant call tonight\u2019s He keeps telling me that I am not a burden but that\u2019s hard to believe. I know that if it comes to it he will be happier that I called than if I cut but i honestly feel so guilty emotion dumping on him like this. I know this will pass soon; it always does. But my question is should I continue to tell him or try and deal with it myself (which usually fails) and just not tell him about the cuts in an effort to not burden him? I\u2019m very conflicted, and every time I tell him I feel so incredibly guilty. All advice is appreciated :)", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I've never been a deep cutter, I more or less scratch and scrape myself unit the skin is so raw that it bleeds. I sometimes do this over old scars to minimize scarring/ the amount of scars. I've always considered myself a wuss because of this, I've always been scared to really CUT myself. Lately, my mental and emotional pain have been excruciating to say the least. I haven't self harmed in 7 days. 7 days.... 7 days. I'm trying so hard to abstain. I have a million reasons not to. I have one reason to do it. It makes me feel better. It makes me not hurt. It takes all the built up pain, heartache, anger, sorrow and anxiety and releases it through one small insignificant place. I think I started when I was 13 or so. I stopped for quite a few years, but just like any addiction, it came right on back into my life, uninvited. I feel like posting here may be helping. I feel like reading what everyone else feels is helping. I feel like I'm less alone, even though physically, I'm not alone. I have so many things to be thankful for, but when I get to that place, you all know that place, when I get there, it's hard to see anything outside of it. Initially in writing this, I had the overwhelming feeling that maybe I could cut a little deeper. Initially in writing this, I didnt know that this wouldn't end with me cutting myself. This has however ended with me potentially finding a healthier coping mechanism. Years ago, when I couldn't figure out how to get out of my own goddamn head, I would write. Evidently it's still helpful. So, I will leave you with the knowledge that I haven't harmed myself and I'm fairly confident that this will be one more day harm free.

I was sat at home I saw my Swiss army knife and that's when it all began. I made 4 small cuts in my left wrist and watched as they bled. I wanted to feel ashamed but something in me said I deserved it and that I had to keep doing it because all of my actions had led me to that. \n\nI didn't know what to tell people if they ever saw I hoped no one would but I eventually had to tell someone I don't know why I told them they were close to me so I guess that's why. She told me I had to stop and that was the first time I ever tried to get clean it lasted about 3 months before my best friend and I got into a huge argument and I immediately started cutting again. It took me ages to stop again eventually I'd left high school and I was able to stop for the better part of a year before I started again it was after my dad had been admitted into hospital and I was pretty off and on again with it untill this year now I'm about 8 or 9 months clean because of my amazing friends and because of the help I got but there's still that part of me that believes I deserve it and I know it will never go away because the problem with people like me is as soon as something goes wrong I immediately start looking for reasons to self harm again and I've recognised this and I've hide my knives from myself. \n\nMy advice to people looking to quit is hide your knives and blades give them to trusted people book therapy appointments. If your British you can go to your gp and say your really struggling with self harm and they will refer you to a therapist and if your willing to open up it can really help and if you don't think you can open up to someone close to you friends and family mom's dad's brothers sisters aunts uncles granddad's or grandma's or literally anyone you trust even if it's a teacher just please tell someone. I wasn't brave enough to tell my mom I had a member of the college wealthfare team do it for me because I physically couldn't look my mom in the eyes and say mom I struggle with self harming and telling dad isn't an option. Dad is supportive but this is something he doesn't understand and I don't expect him too because he shouldn't have too. My next bit of advice is even if you trust the person you cannot expect them to understand because it's hard to understand why anyone would want to harm them selves they may need time they may just want to know why don't be afraid to tell people you care about. \n\nI hope I'm able to help some of you it's not easy. I know it's not easy but sometimes when I look back I think it was easier to quit then I made it for myself.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

If it\u2019s too long you can just skip to my last paragraph with my actual question/concern.\n\n\n**So basically, I (23/f) was diagnosed with major depression disorder &amp; ptsd and was medically retired from the military after my husband committed suicide and I found his body. We were together for 5 years, have a two year old daughter together. I am in a new relationship now with a great guy, he loves my daughter like if she was his own, he also helped me get my shit together. He has his own personal issues...but he also has this jealousy/hatred about my late husband. He tries his best to hide his jealousy/anger whenever he comes up or I have to spend time with late husband\u2019s family/friends but a lot of the times it starts fights between us and lately it\u2019s been stressing me out a lot. I try really hard to make it easier for him by not having pictures of him everywhere etc. I\u2019m a very emotional person and so is he, but he struggles a lot with showing empathy. Whenever I cry or sob he literally isn\u2019t phased by it. He will walk right past me a lot of the times and just ignore me... it\u2019s the worst feeling in the world to me because my parents did the same thing to me when I lived at home and would cry. My dad was an alcoholic and he would even mock me sometimes when I was crying. Also had an abusive ex in high school who would mock/ignore me if I started crying. Idk what to do.**\n\n\nI just feel downright pathetic/worthless. everyone I love doesn\u2019t want to help me or care enough to comfort me when I\u2019m hurting and It just makes me start to wonder if there\u2019s something wrong with me or it\u2019s my fault. I started cutting in high school 5-6 years ago back when my ex and parents made me feel worthless, I stopped for a few years and I have that urge again now because my boyfriend is doing the same thing. I want to cut myself for my own relief and anger, but I also would feel really embarrassed if any of my friends or people saw it now as an adult and especially as a mom..at the same time tho I actually kinda hope my boyfriend sees my cuts. But I\u2019m afraid that is toxic... I don\u2019t want to manipulate him or make him feel bad about himself. Like I would never just say \u201cI\u2019m doing this because of you!!\u201d I just feel so desperate for him to see that I\u2019m actually really in pain and I want to just feel that he cares for once.

So I just kind of went at my hand in the middle of class. (With a staple) It didn't go over well, and the people around me found out.\n\nI was trying to hide it, as to not bother people, as it started earlier in the class beforehand, and I just couldn't suppress it any longer. Ig I just felt lonely, and secretly wanted someone to find out, and try and help me. At least ask me if I was okay. A girl at my table tried to ask me stop, and to hand over what I was using, but that was the most support I got.\n\nOne kid asked me to \"do it on my own time\" because it made him uncomfortable. Which I get, it probably wasn't the most beautiful thing to witness. (Even though I was trying to hide it, guess that didn't go too well) as if the urge to cut really has a schedule, though. Somebody else said I was just an emo pretending to slit my wrist. And the other one just made plain old fun of me.\n\nI finally surrendered the staple I was using to the girl that asked for it, I hated myself for what I was doing to these people. But it wasn't enough, so thank god I keep extra staples in my bag. So I brought another one out, and continued, much to my own hatred for myself.\n\nAt that point, I was really just scratching, there was no real cutting, but I had to. So I decided to go to the bathroom, as I had felt like doing before, but I had to pay attention to the lesson due to a test the next day. Everyone knew what I was going to do when I left the room, I had so much unwanted attention on me.\n\nSo I did, in the bathroom, what everyone knew I was going to, cut. Nobody cared. Nobody followed. There was only so much I could do with what I was using, and I didn't want to take too long, seeing as it was almost the end of class. Walking back into that class was probably one of the hardest things I've had to do. There were so many eyes turned in my direction, and it's all my fault.\n\nWhen I got back, it was just more teasing \"ooh girl, show me those anklesss\" type thing. I put those teenagers through so much in one class period and I feel absolutely terrible for it.\n\nTbh I really just wanted someone to care, to follow me, just a simple \"are you okay\" would have been nice, and it probably would've brought me to a halt. And I'm curious as to what other people think. Was this selfish of me??? Idk, I'm at a loss as for what I should think..\n\nEdit: Don't sympathize or sugarcoat your answers because you feel the need to for me. I'm open to all thoughts or concerns one may have. This post was not me looking for sympathy for my dumb actions, but any advice and thoughts you may have.\n\nI'd also like to point out, that this was a last resort for me, seeing as I had reached out for help many times before, from people I thought would be supportive. I did not do this for the sole purpose of getting attention.\n\n Okai, enough of my ranting ig:)", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I don't quite remember the details tho cause I was woozy as hell) and as a result of that and the fact that I have a blood disorder (Von willerbrand syndrome, look it up) I had to go to hospital for stitches. Since then I wanted to do more like that. I'm a bit sick. I like hospitals in a way that the nurses are so kind and gentle, unlike anyone who I've ever loved have treated me. But tangent aside, my mum and stepdad took away my blades and scissors and razors, everything of the sort. But when I was eating dinner tonight, I realized our new butter knives that we got yesterday were more serrated than our old ones. So I instantly thought that I should see what potential it has. I tried it, it worked. It could do styro. I only did it a few times but fuck.. I've been craving that shit for weeks.\n\nThe problem is, now that I know that those are in my house, accessibly, I just know I will go haywire soon and end up either dead or in the hospital again. I can't tell my mum aaagh, help. If i do it a certain way, it can really do some damage. (Not good cause bleeding disorder)\n\nTLDR; mum took tools away, found a butter knife that's sharper than our old ones, cut, put it back in the drawer, now I know it's there I might cut again VERY badly.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I wish, I could show them how much pain their words and actions caused me, but I can't. No amount of scars or tears can express how much guilt they made me feel for being alive, and that's okay.\n\nFor whatever reason that fact puts my mind at ease. I guess, it's because it makes the tears I cried and the scars I have seem less important compared to my feelings. I like that thought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel better after writing this. If anyone can relate to my feelings do tell me. I've felt so lonely since none of my friends could relate. Feel free to ask questions if you want. I am new to reddit so I don't really know what to expect. I just wanted to share my thoughts.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}
