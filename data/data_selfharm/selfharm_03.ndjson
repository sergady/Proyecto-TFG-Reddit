{"post_id": "avy0io", "created_utc": 1551398823, "title": "Think I recovered today", "author": "GrimTin", "self_text": "It's been about two years since I self harmed. I've been talking to this girl on and off for a few months, from Tinder, it's not worth the story, but I knew she wasn't into me, I'd ignored the evidence, but I knew, you know? It still hurt when she said it though, more than it should have, this has definitely been a learning experience for me, I shouldn't have hurt as much as it did, but it did. Part of it was because I knew it meant I couldn't talk to her anymore, and I'm lonely, and it was nice to think about not being lonely for a bit you know?\n\nSo, I felt like shit and it was my own fault, I felt pretty stupid. Then I felt pretty pathetic. Then I started feeling worthless, and then when I washed my hands and pulled my sleeves up my scars felt cold, stiff, the water over them felt familiar, and I really thought about it. Like I've had some urges the last couple years, but like flashes, not like vivid imaginations. What's wrong with me, why am I so alone, why can't I be better, I should cut.\n\nBut the whole time I'm thinking this, I'm cleaning, because I know it's a good idea to fill my hands right now, distract myself, that having my room a tip might make me spiral downwards, and I don't need more reasons to feel down on myself now. Then I sat down and I recorded a version of the song I've been covering, Chelsea Hotel by Leonard Cohen, and I first take did the best version I've ever done. It wasn't perfect, but definitely best overall, hit most of my marks, a song I've been associating with her this whole time. It helped, not totally, but I didn't feel sick to my stomach anymore, I sang it 2-3 more times, but none were better than the first, these are my long term gratification coping mechanisms paying off. Both took work, and were not always helpful (one of my relapses was even over not being able to sing as well as I wanted), but I kept doing it and now I'm better than I ever thought I could be, same with guitar. I'm very rarely frustrated with either. I sent it to her and said my goodbyes, it wasn't what either of us wanted, but neither of us can change that.\n\nI reached out to a friend over Facebook, he didn't reply, so I reached out to my guitar teacher during my lesson today. We've become pretty close over the last year, he would agree. I talked about my urges to self harm before I gave in. This emotional release (I asked him for a hug and told him I see him as a role model, it was nice) through conversation helped satiate my urges to self harm. After a 15 minute chat we got into the lesson, learning a skill is awesome, takes your mind away from negative thoughts and gives you a sense of satisfaction through progress. At least it does once you tune down your frustrations when you begin, but learning to deal with that comes through playing, skill building is all about refocusing, coming back. It's okay to get mad, it's not okay to stop, and getting mad makes you learn slower, so if you're annoyed about your progress you have to calm yourself.\n\nLesson finishes, I go upstairs and continue working on my first song that I've been writing. Lyrics are on draft 1.5, I put some chords to it the other day, didn't know how to do the chorus. I just sat and tried some stuff I knew until it worked, same as I did before, I'd had other songs I held off putting chords to because I didn't know how, but I couldn't know how without just strumming away at something. I'm not even sad anymore, 2 hours ago I'd had my most intense self harm urges in 2 years, and I've already practically forgotten. Finished the day playing my first song for my mum, she cried, and telling her how shit I felt today, and talking about my feelings. Who the fuck am I.\n\nI'm gonna play that song on Monday too, I'm not even going to do a proper second draft, just sing it and change as I go through learning. I don't care that it might suck, I don't care that I'm going to play to a pub half filled with better musicians/songwriters than me, because like everything else this is going to be scary until I do it, so I'm going to waste less time thinking about why I shouldn't. I mean not caring isn't the right word, I care, but I'm not afraid to fail, because as long as you learn, failure is welcome. Used to cut myself because I wasn't getting 1st's (70%) for Uni assignments.\n\nBut I thought all of things so many of you think, I thought I was going to cut forever, I thought I would always be depressed, and there was nothing I could do. I thought about killing myself, 6 out of 7 days a week for a while. I used to think nobody would care, nobody would listen. That I was a piece of shit, totally worthless, revolting moron who was in everyone's way, stealing everyone's air. That I'd never do anything, never achieve anything, but I just started doing what I loved for fun, and around 4 years into it I've started to excel, this whole last year has been crazy progress. Because when I tone my self criticism down, it helps me quickly identify my mistakes in playing and singing, and the most effect way to get better is to play targeting mistakes. My brain that over thinks things now works in overdrive, you learn a lot in between sessions too, guitar playing is about creating neural pathways, so your hands move more efficiently. They have to remember the shape of chords, the distance between strings, depending on how high up the guitar you are. You form them through practice, but they don't finish until long after a session, sometimes it surprises me how much better I am at something the next day after giving it 10-20 tries.\n\nI never thought that I'd be good for anything, but the same brain that made me feel like shit is propelling me forwards now, I just had to find the right thing. Sorry if anyone actually reads this whole mess, if I wasn't so high it might have been concise enough to read.\n\nTL;DR You're more capable than you think, I wasn't the piece of shit I thought I was and you don't have to be either but it starts by stopping hurting yourself and being unashamed to find and pursue the thing you love, al thought they'll probably come jumbled at the same time rather than smoothly in that order.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

And I know this is r/selfharm, but there could be a low chance of a TW. This happened to me and it hurt really bad, so I figured I'd tell what happened here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, I've been trying to stop cutting. Last night, I ended up cutting up a lot of my arm. When I came to school the next day (today), I wasn't really in the best of moods. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I have a friend, who we'll call Jim due to his Office obsession. (I like it too)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJim has a history of sh, but ended up getting out of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI go over to my desk (Jim sits across from me), and he notices my down mood. I end up taking off my jacket because it's hot out (don't know why, it's winter), but because of the excessive cuts on my arm, I put my jacket over my arm and lay on it to pretend like I'm not just covering it. (I'm wearing a short sleeve because I don't have a ton of long sleeves.)\n\nAnother friend of ours was hanging out, and because of Jim and Pam, we'll call her Pam.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo since school hadn't fully started, Pam was next to Jim and I as we talked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJim proceeds to say \"I know what's wrong,\" and I ask \"How do you know?\" (he knew about my own history, but people were around so I didn't make it obvious.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Here, this will explain it.\" He started to pull at my jacket that was covering my arm, and I unhesitatingly moved my arm down under the table out of reflex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter witnessing this, Pam says \"Oh. I see now too.\" (or something similar), and she walks away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm already a little angry, and there's about an 80% chance he just outed me to a friend. Despite still being hot, I just put my jacket back on. I didn't want to deal with more of this BS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother friend noticed this. We'll just call her Sky because she has tons of characters in her stories and that's the name of one of them. She came over and asked if I was okay (we were now on our way to PE), and I said I was fine, and asked Jim to back me up because I would've done the same for him. \n\nGuess what he says? \"No, you're not fine. Tell all of us why you're down.\"\n\nThe reason involved sh itself. I wasn't about to out myself, it's pretty damn sensitive for me. (And it was for Jim too, he didn't tell a single person offline except me since we both knew about our histories.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just ran away, similarly to what I do with my problems.\n\nThey kept confronting me about it. \n\nI eventually just plain out told them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I'd prefer not to talk about it. I have a seven-letter-word too, oh it's privacy!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJim is a really close friend, and I was going to talk to him anywhere that didn't have tons of people in them. We rely on each other to vent. I told him this directly, as well, but he wanted to know *right this instant.* So, when all of the friend group was together, he starts asking Sky a nice question. Now Sky was innocent, so she wouldn't really know a lot of things like that really happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe asks her, \"Hey, do you know what hurting yourself is? Like self-harm?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, out of instinct, I ran. I didn't want to be around them during this at all. It probably made me look more suspicious than he was making it. While I was running, he shouts out at me \"You can't run from all of your problems!\" He was the one making me running away seem more suspicious. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we pass each other, still during PE, Jim says the worst possible combination of words he could ever say.\n\n\"Hey, they know now. You had to open up eventually.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBelieve me, I started to panic. I couldn't imagine my own friends knowing that I cut myself to relieve stress. I wanted to cry, I wanted to out his previous history, I wanted to do everything that would be horrible to do in that case. Right when I'm about to mentally pass out, he says more words that make me almost actually hate him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I'm kidding.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry, but nobody likes being told they were outed, only for that to be a damn joke. At this point, I'm actually angry. I want to avoid him as much as I can. While I'm at it, I might as well say that, just in case he actually did tell them, nothing is wrong with me to Sky and the others (didn't manage to do that with Pam, she was probably outed before the others)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo during that, we have another friend that will be relevant later. We'll call her Isadora because of her ASOUE (A Series of Unfortunate Events) obsession. I told her that if he did say anything, it's false. \n\nSince he was the one to do shit like this (kinda fits with Jim, actually), I easily blamed it on him doing stupid shit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward, it's now after PE and we're going back to English. I sit at my desk, and he sits at his.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow he's pretty much begging for me to tell him, and I kept telling him I won't until later because people still sit around us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get a nice response.\n\n\"No. You're going to tell me right now.\"\n\nI tell him \"I have a right to my own damn business. Like I said, I'll tell you later, but I don't know if I even want to tell you anymore.\"\n\nHe agrees (finally) and English is starting, so we start writing our stuff down. I explain that he was secretive on his own history, and he needed to calm the hell down. He's still pulling his defensive shit, as usual. One of the things he explains was \"I wasn't going to out you, I was just trying to persuade you to tell me.\" That made me even more furious, and I actually wanted to sh more than he was trying to stop me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, we just stop writing stuff down and focus on our work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to lunch. I brought my pencil because I was already urging and needed some sort of relaxer to fidget with. Now we're all messing around, when Isadora here (she might have been talking about something else or I heard her wrong because I was paranoid), says \"I see some red lines around here.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven if it wasn't aimed at me, it definitely hurt me. After that, I walked away from them. I couldn't deal with it at all. I moved away from them, and when we get back to class, we act like normal. Definitely strange, but man it still hurt to be around him, after what he pulled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: \n\nFriend tries to get me to move arm from hiding, which other friend realizes\n\nSame friend holds it over my head the whole day, then says that he did it to get me to fess what was wrong, because I was a little down when I came in after having a lot of scars on my arm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(that's a little too short, you should probably just read the actual thing.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what I need to know is what I need to do if he ever does this again. I've been trying to quit, but he's forcing the process on me very hard. I was super miserable because of him, and I want to stand up to him if he does this again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading, but sorry for the long post.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Specifically telling me that only mentally retarted people do that.So when she found out about the cuts on my thighs we were at a parking lot with a big crowd since it was a pretty popular restraunt.I was wearing shorts at the time because me being my stupid self didnt think about the cuts.Anyway, i told my mom i wanted to stay in the car because the place was too crowded for me(i have a lot of anxiety when it comes to crowded spaces with people) and my mom that doesnt give a care in the world about my feelings is like \"so? Stop being such a drama queen.Stop overeacting like jeez no ones gonna give a crap about how you look,\" but i told her that it wasnt because of the way i look its just cause its too crowded,but either way i decided to get down.Once i was in the parking lot i chickened out again and told my mom \"Actually can i stay in the car ,i really dont feel comfortable with this much people,\" And the mom that she is starts yelling at me telling me \"are you serious?? We got down and now your complaing ,can we ever have a normal dinner? why do you always ruin everything ,and you always have to start with your trantrums\" And at that point i started crying Because we were in a parking lot full of people,i felt embarrassed.I felt like a million needles were stabbing my brain.I started having a panic attack.I ran back to the car opened it and stayed in it until ten seconds later my mom opens the car door.and starts yelling at me with continuous crap ,while i was crying.She finally notices the cuts on my thighs and says this exactly \"Are you serious ?? ,what is this? ,why are doing that to yourself,do you need to go to a mental hospital ,cause your obviously sick in your head if you think thats okay ,\" At this point im hysterically  crying because shes yelling all of this at me.And i just couldnt take anymore i took her hands off my wrists cause she was tightly holding it ,and i told her to back off and i closed the car door on her and locked all the car door so she wouldnt get in and she yells at me you better have this goddamn car open by the time im done with this dinner.So she leaves while im hysterically crying and shaking cause of what just happened .I texted my so called \"bestfriend \" about what happened in hopes of her maybe comforting me but instead says stuff well like i mean okay its not my problem,And so i turn off my phone and start breathing in and out to calm myself but i couldn't, i layed down covering my head so no one could hear me i just wanted to run away\n\n\nI was also really hurt cause my older sister didnt try to stop my mom from yelling at me neither did my younger sister i felt sort of betrayed. \n\n\nSorry for annoying you with this story i know it was really long sorry i just had to get it out because no one really listens to what i have to say so i just wanted to get my thoughts out of my brain. \n \nI dont know what i should do ,anyone have any advice?", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

However the most common solution is to scratch at the bite. we all know that this doesnt help the bite get better at all but it provides instant and temporary relief.  when that relief is gone the itch comes back and we end up in a cycle of scratching at the bites until we have scabs. \n\nself injury works in the same way. a bad situation or triggering event arises (the bite). we respond to the event or we have feelings about the event (the itchiness). there are good ways of coping or dealing with our feelings (solutions to cure the itchiness) like therapy or talking with others (ointments,creams etc). and although the bite is still there it relieves the problem. However, those that self injure deal with the event (mosquito bite) much differently. many of us do not like the ointments that can treat the problem slowly but surely. we want instant relief. so instead of applying ointment we scratch (self injure). we all know the scratching wont help but will only make things worse however we want temporary relief from the itch(feelings/thoughts). after we stop with the scratching the itch may subside for a time before flaring back up. instead of reaching for the other solutions that take time (therapy/counseling/etc) we want the instantaneous relief. we scratch. \n\nwe scratch over and over till we are scarred. not necessarily because we want to. but because its what is easiest at the time and what we have grown accustomed to. We end up doing tthis for so long we forget that there is a solution other than scratching. \nin many ways we have to relearn how not to scratch and how to properly treat our bites. \n\nso please give those that scratch a break and try to help them remember what its like not to scratch and other things they can do. \n\nThank you\n\nas promised \nTL;DNR. mosquito bites(trigger or life event). scratching (selfharm) is a instant and temporary relief to itchiness(feeling/trigger/problems)", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I've got college coming soon and other big things etc etc, but that just made me feel worse. Like, if I have all these great things happening to me, why do I always feel like shit? Why do I feel the need to cut myself with razors??\n\nLong story short, I went back to my therapist from a couple years ago (different reason from last time) and it turns out I might be somewhat slightly depressed?

I've only ever told my best friend of six years about this only a year and a half ago because thats when I started unravelling from it and I thought it was best that she knew just in case and in advance of anything. Btw I have massive trust issues, only started telling my best friend that I wasn't always 'Fine' after three years into it and only really slowly opened up to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore uni started she always said that she hoped we wouldn't drift apart and was always worried about it and I always shrugged it off saying 'nahh it wouldn't happen' and 'we've been together for so long there is no reason why it would stop' and for the first term of uni everything was good (she went to a different uni in the opposite direction to me from my hometown), we were messaging like normal - although she struggled to respond sometimes to my s/h. But she had always been there for me and always used to say that she isn't going anywhere whenever I hesitated to talk to her. But recently we just stopped talking and I couldn't just pop up for support out of nowhere because i was scared that's all I'd continue to do. But she is fine without me and turns out I was more worried about drifting off than her. And it kills me that we used to be so close, closer than some of her family members and we'd turn normal texts into hours and hours of phone calls and now theres nothing. Then my s/h comes into this and is just generally exacerbated from this and i relapsed hard from this and have no memory of ordering a box cutter (thanks amazon prime). I'm in limbo between not wanting to message her being scared of driving her further away or messaging her because it feels like a vacuum that i need to fill with her. So i s/h when i message her, when I'm waiting for a reply i s/h and when i get a message back i s/h. I know it might sound unhealthy but i just want things to be back how they were a month ago.\n\nShe always suggested i get help and i always turned her down back when i just used to scratch away with whatever i could find and would get terrified with any blood surfacing, now thats all i look for in clean perfect cuts.\n\nI honestly can't describe what i feel anymore. I have used s/h to numb with every cut being a tiny filter for everything i feel when i have some sensory overload/complex emotions. I just do it for the adrenaline to function at this point.\n\nBut yeah, pretty crazy how someone could have that much of an impact on me, why I've always been wary of people. Guess its a good enough reason to not open up to my uni friends because they'll just leave anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know some good advice would probably be to move on and work reducing my s/h but in all honesty, I can't do either. I can't stop the s/h because i wouldn't have anything left to cling to and i am not ready to be without her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Miss my best friend who helped with my s/h.

The reason I started was because I thought it would make me feel better due to a toxic relationship, and it developed into an addiction which comes and goes based on stress levels. I never really make the active decision to stop, I just stop feeling the urge. Recently, our lead trumpet in my jazz band was banned from attending our big trip at the end of the month (that\u2019s another story) and I have to fill in. This is arguably the hardest part to cover since it takes a lot of physical effort to play that range on trumpet, and although I used to be able to play that, I\u2019m very out of practice. This, on top of a lot of school work and my job in retail, has ramped up my stress by a lot. \n\nSo for context, I used to be a hardcore stoner as a replacement to calm down when I got overwhelmed, but I stopped because I am not 21 and my girlfriend, understandably, doesn\u2019t support underage drug use, so I stopped. She doesn\u2019t care about weed in general, but I\u2019m not about to go breaking the law again. I wasn\u2019t a good person during this time. Ok tangent over. \n\nSo last night I was in the middle of a stress induced breakdown, and usually I\u2019d just get super stoned to calm down, but because I know my girlfriend would be very hurt by this, I didn\u2019t. I had to lock myself in my room in order to not cut, because that\u2019s my other go to relaxer. I\u2019m scared that if i have another breakdown I\u2019m either going to cut, and get addicted again, or rely on drugs to relax, and hurt my girlfriend. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m looking for advice or just to rant, but here it is. I am seeing a therapist and am taking antideppressants/anti anxiety meds (just switched to Prozac yesterday) so yeah.

We will put that in your record.\" When I attempted to explain to her that if these were for attention, they'd probably be ya know.. visible?

Maybe it's the recent relapses, but this always and forever pisses me off. Any form of self harm is a valid reason to be concerned.

I was extremely confident in that happening.\n\n\nThat past week i hadnt cared about any message or about what anyone said tbh. Its pretty shitty because people responded saying reasons why not to cut and i didnt care, and i probably wont now either tbh. Sorry to cause trouble because ik you guys have bigger struggles than me and are just trying to help but there was nothing you could have said to stop me. Honestly. \n\n\nI was planning to cut in about an hour. My discord friend (yes im lonely) and i were talking. She told me to promise her not to start self harming. It was probably one of the hardest promises that i have ever made and probably will break at some point. I gave my sister my razor blade and told her to keep it somewhere safe. I was so stressed in the moment that i was gonna break it and felt much better for a couple days afterwards. \n\n\nThen of course i started getting urges. Its been almost a week and the urges are getting bigger every day. I sometimes think that if i break the promise it wont be a big deal. But ik it will hurt her so much and i will really hate myself afterwards if i do that to her. Idk what to do. I mean i dont want advice because ik i will just not care. I think i just need more friends tbh. \n\n\nI want the razor blade back so bad now. The urges havent gotten as bad as before yet but i feel really uncomfortable without the blade. Besides the blade i only have kitchen knifes and they might hurt alot because they might be dull. With a razor its really easy to just break skin really fast with no effort and the pain goes away fast. \n\n\nNow im thinking about those couple of days with no urges. I really miss them.

Because my mother would always pick on me. . for the littlest things. Now I only remember tiny fragments of how it would go.. Because when I was ten I got hit by a car. That day, I lost a lot. I mean, I was already pretty messed up but after my accident I was in a coma for four days. I suffered a traumatic brain injury. And also was diagnosed with a \u2018Neurological Brain Disorder\u2019 - I don\u2019t know everything about it but ever since then I have lost some of my memory including that day. I cannot remember it, at all. I was also diagnosed with ADHD. If you don\u2019t know what that means it\u2019s Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Right after coming out of the hospital and recovering I remember going to school again(?) and being bullied. It started off with me wanting to make friends- and I said one thing about this girls boyfriend cause I thought he was cute and boom, everyone hated me. I was shunned. I sat by myself at lunch. I had zero friends. Lost friends, and was cornered at recess. It was a horrible time for me. The teachers did nothing. The Principal did nothing. There was a wall by the water fountain where people would write mean things about me.  Anyway, fast forward to middle school- because of my ADHD, everything was hard for me. My TBI affected other things emotionally and mentally but what was the worst was being homeless. My mother lost her job and got evicted. We had to go live with my step dad, ( me and my brother ) my mother lived somewhere else first. That\u2019s when my depression started kicking in, really. I don\u2019t remember why really. I think it was because I had no friends, my mom was abusive and I didn\u2019t have anyone to talk to. Besides my younger brother who barely understood me but thankfully listened.  After that, I couldn\u2019t live with my step dad anymore. Well, I could but my mom took me away and I was forced to live with her in a homeless shelter. That\u2019s when the physical abuse happened. \n\n( Side note; I skipped the part where my mother\u2019s boyfriend sexually assaulted me when I was 12 ) \n\nMy mother hit me. She verbally and mentally abused me. With constant bullying and neglecting. We were homeless so she didn\u2019t have money cause she didn\u2019t have a job, cause she didn\u2019t want to get one so I would starve myself.  It\u2019s a long story. But I cut, and I starved myself. I even experienced my first ever real heart break at fourteen. At fifteen I had a job, and things were going well but living with my mom just wasn\u2019t working so my older brother who for some odd reason disappeared for that entire time of me being homeless came into my life again. He took custody of me and became my guardian to help me get away from my mom. \n\nLong story short, when I was in my mom\u2019s custody I attempted suicide that\u2019s when my brother finally took me in. \n\nAfter that, I attempted suicide two more times. \n\nI am currently seventeen about to be eighteen and my life is horrible. My brother and I are barely talking. He treats me like I am not even there. Like I am invisible. I have only one best friend who lives thousands of miles away. My boyfriend and I are struggling to be together because we don\u2019t know how we will ever be able to live together cause he\u2019s in a group home (he\u2019s amazing tho) My mother is not even a person I can reach out to because I will never allow myself to give her another chance - tried that didn\u2019t work. \n\nI am a seventeen year old girl with severe depression, TBI, anxiety,  and PTSD. \n\nI have cut recently.

But anyway..\n\nWe've been dating for over 2 weeks and not too long ago, I told him about my Depression, Anxiety and possible PTSD. The day after that, I told him of my minor self harm (this happened before the blade relapse a couple days ago) and he was really nice about it. Dom told me that I can talk to him about anything. Yanno, the generic fluff. \n\nThen, the blade relapse came. I was supposed to be asleep, so I couldn't message him for help or advice. I totally lost control, broke a razor** and sliced my arm. I was very split about it. I regretted it, but I also didn't. \n\nSkip to the next day, I'm talking to Dominic.\n\nThroughout the conversation I felt unbearably guilty. Usually, our conversations start with a hello and then we talk about random shit. Then he'll ask how my day's been and I'll be somewhat honest. If it's been terrible and all my mental disorders are torturing me, I'll tell him that my day either \"could be better\" or is \"bad/shit\". If I'm feeling okay, I'll tell him just that. That day, I made it very obvious that I was feeling far worse than usual. He caught on. I told him about the blade relapse and again, he was very nice about it. I felt guilty for making him worry, but I would have felt worse for flat out lying. \n\nDominic told me that he loves me and that I can talk to him about anything. He wants me to talk to him about why my day was shit, why I relapsed. I just wish I had the words. I'm awful at talking to people, and yes, it's easier over text, I still worry a lot. As much as I wanted to tell him how I am feeling, I just can't for the life of me put the words together. It makes me feel worse. I feel like I'm letting him down. \n\nNot sure why I'm posting this on here..I guess it's nice to rant. If you do have any advice, please god tell me. \n\n*Before you say \"Oh, Edge, stranger danger!\" We've video called. He's definitely 16, don't worry.\n\n**You might be wondering why I chose to break the razor rather than using it as it was. I like having control. The razor had 3 blades. I wouldn't have the control I want.\n\nIf you read all of this...wow. Thank you. \ud83d\udc9d", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I was worried as o left the house that I was feeling low, so I brought a razor blade and two bandaids. It started off well, I was with a couple and my friend who convinced me to go. She was visibly bored at the party and really not having a good time at all. I was feeling like I need a little boost so I went to the secluded bathroom and you know how that goes. Little did I know, my friend was in the bathroom with me, but she didn\u2019t comment and I don\u2019t think she noticed. That was my ankle that I cut. Then, I went back to the party and was dancing with some other friends and my friend is calling her mother, and very soon, her mother picks her up. I\u2019m now with this couple (I hated being around them I was legit a third wheel.) so I\u2019m not allowed to leave to go to the far bathroom again (where I was) and I start feeling very anxious and try to calm down my washing my face. Doesn\u2019t work, so I cut again, this time, my upper thigh. I feel better, but soon feel worse and the music feels louder and everything\u2019s closing in and the people are too close so I leave.\n      I go to sit a few steps away from the party. I\u2019m, at this point, visibly distressed. A teacher comes up and asks if I\u2019m ok, I say I\u2019m just tired. Next, the couple come by and ask if I\u2019m okay, and I tell them all is good and I want them to enjoy the party. You can tell the girl is reluctant to go, but the boyfriend wants to leave. I don\u2019t blame him, I don\u2019t know him too well and he\u2019s not mean, I can just understand that he would want to be with his girlfriend. A short while after, a friend who I was previously close with and is actually really nice came up to me and tried to be supportive but I broke down and my second wave of panic attacks came through. There were a total of two, that one being the worst. \nI ask her to leave, and said I appreciate her help.\nMy mom already said she didn\u2019t want to have to pick me up early because of a panic attack but I broke and called her and she then came to pick me up.\nMy thigh cuts (3 specifically) have not stopped and I\u2019m a little confuzzled at the moment and everything\u2019s fuzzy and my head hurts and i want to sleep.

It all started in 9th grade when my girlfriend broke up with me. At that point I had dealt with alot but for some stupid reason that pushed me to react in a way I never had before; I punched a brick wall repeatedly. The intense, overwhelming pain of that is something that I can never forget. At that moment, I couldn't think of how bad I hurt emotionally, all I could feel was the pain radiating from my knuckles which was something that is far easier to process. At that point I was hooked like a junkie to heroin, like a hooker to dick, it's all I wanted.\n\nEvery time I was upset or bothered I would hit solid objects, purposely avoiding things that would 'give' under the pressure. More times than I can count I would punch something until my hand was no longer able to form a fist, my knuckles swelling until all I had was a 'monoknuckle'. For me it was pure ecstasy for I had found a solution for all of my emotional outrage that had no other outlet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor years this is how I handled my anger and general outrage at unfortunate life events. Boss harassing me? Go punch a shelf. Coworker being an absolute tool? Sock a wall. Manager making my life harder than it needed to be? You guessed it, PUNCH SOMETHING. This slowly evolved to violently taking out my anger and discontent at every opportunity. Primarily I stuck to hitting inanimate objects, never, ever people, just 'stupid things'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the years went by the punching related injuries started to stack up. First it started with flattening the knuckles in my dominate hand which turned into untreated fractures rather quickly. Now when I lay my hands flat on a table one hand appears as if its from someone else. My dominate hand now has dark scars around the knuckles, the knuckles look 'flat' compared to the knuckles on my other hand, my pinky knuckle sticks up above the rest (untreated boxers fracture from moving an old 32 cf fridge backwards 6-8in with a single punch) and in general it just hurts all of the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's taken until literally this year for me to connect the dots that this is a form of self harm. I always figured that it was simply a poor way of handling my emotions, not that I was going out of my way to infect injuries upon myself. Honestly, I kind of feel mentally retarded for taking this goddamn long to figure that out. (I'll be 31 this year....) Once I realized that this was a self harming issue, I started to do my best to fight the urges. But it's goddamn hard, harder than I could have realized. When you've built you're entire stress handling mechanisms to default to self harm, it is beyond difficult to shift to something 'healthy' or 'productive'.  Like all I want to do when I'm upset is to hurt myself and others (NEVER VIOLENTLY, just.... emotionally.... and only if they were involved in upsetting me).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow does one figure out a better way of handling internal rage/strife that doesn't involve hurting one's self or another?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurrently all I've figured out is to: One; not hit shit and Two; when I hit shit, make damn well sure it cannot break or hurt me. Otherwise I'll take out the rage/anger in other ways, like driving far too aggressively. There was a point last year where I burned up the drive tires on my Hyundai Veloster in about 750-800 miles by being this way (for some stupid reason ferociously burning out from every stop seemed to make me feel better). Thankfully they cost only $60/piece but still, they were rated for 40k miles. Sometimes I'll abuse drugs full well knowing that I might die from the doses. Shit I have HPPD from a 40mg dose of 2-CE (I weighed the dose) and a permanent case of my pupils being a different size from one another. More recently, I tend to not eat for several days on end, until I can barely even walk or move.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not even sure why I'm posting this, maybe I just want to feel not as fucked up. Maybe I just want some advice... I don't know. All I know is while typing this I punched my desk three times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: The title alludes to more than one self harm, as this post was getting long I snipped everything down to just the punching stuff. Honestly, it goes far deeper than that, lightly cut as a teen and as a teen/adult I've abused substances to the point of near death. Like not near death once, but more times than I could honestly count. I have severe scarring up the one arm due to a substance induced psychotic break/suicide attempt (not cutting, basically took 2-3k the recommended dose of a benzo and passed out on the arm for several days). Basically if it is something that can be a risk to my life, I fucking embrace that bitch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2: When it comes to feeling pain, I tend to laugh a LOT. Just the other day I was driving my motorized bicycle doing about 30mph (wearing no gear) and managed to hit a small patch of gravel which sent me sliding down the road. My left knee and left elbow were torn up bad and my only reaction was to laugh hysterically, despite the bloody jeans and sliding in front of a long line of traffic. That isn't normal, I think. But then again what the fuck is 'normal'?", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

If you cut a specific body part draw on that part of your body. Markers and paintbrushes are good if your worried that you won\u2019t be able to control yourself. If you miss the look of cutting you can swatch lipsticks on your body part( go to a drugstore and pick up a wetnwild lipstick for 2 dollars male or female you can do this) when you\u2019re still learning to stop even LIGHT rubber band snaps can help. \n\nIf you do other self harm actions do it on a stuffed animal or pillow. If you\u2019re really upset go to the stuffed animal get it all out pick it up and throw it if you need too.\nIf you feel like to need to feel something ice that body part, use suction cups what create a light odd suction instead of pain,  lay WARM food on yourself ( sounds odd but it can help). \n\nAlso it helps to take care of that part of your body. If you have the means to buy a new watch or bracelet, give yourself a leg massage, or a scalp massage. Sometimes target and Walmart have these 7 dollars massagers or if you\u2019re old enough buy a cheap vibrator, for the body part your self harm (they can be cheaper than some massage tools)\n\n Also if you have scars a vitamin e oil massage can help them a lot \n Get yourself care on. You might hate yourself so much that you don\u2019t think you deserve it, so pretend buy face masks, watch a comedy, drink tea,take an extra long shower or a nice bath. Treat yourself how you would treat your favorite person in the world. You are constantly showing your body so much hate and making it routine. Make self love a routine instead. \n\nSelf harm can become an addiction, you release endorphins that make you temporarily feel good when you do it what why we say \u201c it makes me feel better\u201d \u201c it distracts us\u201d because it temporarily does because that\u2019s the way your body deals with trauma.  Replacing self harm with endorphin creating activities that are positive can help. Work out ( I hate this one but it can work), if you have a pet hang out and take care of it, watch a comedy show,  if you\u2019re in a relationship or have a good friendship talk to that person, if you are of age and with someone who consents and you consent then... you know... anything that if good for you that gives you the good chemicals in your brain. \nAlso remember what recovering is a journey it takes time, and it takes work you have to want to get better in order to get better, and you have I work on getting better.

Pretty deep cuts, all styro after weeks of shallow cuts, the first cut went all the way up my inner arm, a solid 6 inches of styro.\n\n\nAfter I finally calmed down I realised that after the last time I cut I probably took out the last razor.

{"post_id": "az5yjw", "created_utc": 1552153413, "title": "For those wondering why people self-harm", "author": "Lindaero", "self_text": "Hi all. A few days ago I replied to a post about someone worried about their partner and wanted to understand more about self-harm. I posted this (read on next paragraph) and a few people replied saying that it helped them understand why they self-harmed. I thought I should post my comment here in the hopes that it might help even just a couple more people. I understand that there is a rule against medical advice and I wasn't sure if this counted so if I'm breaking the rules I apologise and feel free to take it down. Also on mobile so sorry if its hard to read.\n(Edited to make the comment universal) \n\t\nSo unfortunately there is an actual neurological reason as to why people self-harm. I'll leave an article at the end to explain it better.\n\nBasically, the part of your brain that deals with physical pain also deals with your emotional pain. When you hurt yourself the physical pain can spike but it also goes down again. At the same time, your emotional pain goes down with it. It almost acts like a reset for your emotional distress.\n\nAnother problem is that self-harm acts in a similar way to drugs. For example, most people who cut to self-harm will start off small. They find the pain helps with their emotions and steadily become reliant on it every time they feel emotionally distressed. The more they do it, though, the more the body and mind becomes used to it. And so, you have to increasingly cut more drastically in order to get the same effect. Kind of like how most heroin addicts didn't start off injecting heroin but eventually resort to it as their body gets used to the high. The reason I mention this is that it's important not to disregard someone's self-harm even if it looks very superficial. It is a habit that grows in severity.\n\nOne of the best ways to recover from self-harms is by going to your gp or health professional if you can. They should be respectful and will be able to guide you to the correct help. If the doctor starts berating you for self harm, belittles/ignores the damage or breaks confidentiality, get out of there and find a new one. I only say this because I've experienced doctors like this and they will not help you because they ultimately do not understand how to help. Took me some time to understand this.\n\nFor at home, the best thing you can do for someone who self-harms is to be comforting. Make sure they clean any wounds and that you are there for a chat/cuddle. It may seem helpful but trying to hide things they can use will actually make things worse. Like all addictions, you can't force someone to stop. Only the person can do that for themselves.\n\nTry not to to shout at or guilt the person if they harm. They know it's not healthy and, trust me, it only makes things worse.\n\nMost importantly you need to look out for yourself. You are allowed to take breaks. If your health starts suffering then you won't be able to help. You're only human.\n\nhttps://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/theres-scientific-reason-why-self-harm-makes-some-people-feel-better-180953062/\n\nTLDR: brains are jerks. ", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I'm trying to get better, I really am. But, I just sharpened my knife then realized something. Is it easier to cut if you sharpen the knife more parallel or perpendicular to the pad? Again, I'm making it very clear, I'm asking this so I can sharpen it in the way that makes it *harder* to cut.\n\nAnd I can't just not sharpen the knife, cause when it gets dull it gets rough, and so my cuts are jagged and take longer to heal and are just in general harder to hide. Besides, it's easier to really fuck yourself up with jagged cuts.\n\nSo, please PM me with your answers, because I don't want somebody who doesn't want to get better to see this post and start sharpening to make it easier to cut.\n\nAnd mods, please don't remove this.

But it all went downhill from there. \n\nMy mom started yelling at me, and I don\u2019t even remember what it was about. It just killed me. I went in my room, and I cried. Nothing helped me. I couldn\u2019t stop. For whatever reason, I thought seeing my own blood would calm me. I thought it would make me content, seeing blood drip down my leg. So I got up and grabbed a small knife I had in my room. I held it against my leg and I almost did it. But for some reason, I stopped. I had never gone past scratching the side of my hand. This was a whole new concept. Something about breaking my own skin just didn\u2019t feel right anymore. I kept the knife there until I cried again. I put it away and laid down until I fell asleep. \n\nAs much as I know cutting won\u2019t help anything, I almost feel weak for not having the guts to actually do it. Only one person knows about this, and they have offered to talk with me anytime I feel like cutting again. \n\nAs lucky as I am to have support, I still feel like shit over this. I just needed a place to share this experience. Thank you to anyone who read this. ", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

And this pain I don't like, I just get satisfaction from \"cleaning\" my skin.\nBut, sometimes when something happens that reminds me of how it felt to cut, I remember it vividly and feel a kind of sweet pain of missing it. Like an old friend. What the hell?\nWhat happened right now to make me think about it all and make this alternative account to get it off my chest:\nI was picking at an ingrown hair. I took manicure scissors to hook it out of the skin. (Sorry if it sounds gross.) I scratched accidentally some skin and a big blood drop appeared. I smudged it on the surrounding skin and it felt cold. And this triggered the memory of a fresh cut. And I remembered it so vividly, it's almost creepy. I remember vividly sitting in the school toilet, being lost in my fantasy world and doing what I did. I don't remember the pain, it was never too painful, I never did it for the pain. The stings while cutting were never too much pain. I liked that feeling of cold blood. And I like seeing the cut. I like seeing wounds in general.. This is so fucked up, saying this out loud, I know. But it's also freeing to talk about it that openly. Does anybody else remember it like that and miss it? Why would I miss it although I have reached the conclusion that it's not worth it for me? The more I think about it, the more it freaks me out.

My new year's resolution was to stop harming myself. I've lied to my therapist and my family because I don't want them to be involved with my shit. These methods have helped me throughout the year so far:\n\n- Butterfly: this is something I do myself. Draw a butterfly on your hand (or anywhere else, if you want), it doesn't have to be that good of a drawing. From then on, try your best not to harm yourself anywhere. If you do, retrace the marks of the butterfly so it still stays on. You can't wash it off intentionally. This is to represent how you harming yourself can really hurt somebody else, somebody close to you who cares for you, so the butterfly is somebody who you know doesn't want you to hurt yourself. It should be important to not let the butterfly die by harming yourself. Personally, this helped me stop harming for a week or two. (I got this from childline, I think it works for older people too.) \n\n- Mark where you feel like harming yourself: I also do this sometimes. (I got this from childline too.) Get a pen or marker or anything that can go on your skin without damaging it and mark where you feel like harming yourself. A simple line can work, or maybe dots or some specific thing. For me, this has helped me recognise where I most commonly want to hurt myself, but the marks remind me not to because they're there for a reason. This can work for you or you may find another thing that's better than this. \n\n- Temporary, Short and Quick: I heard this from a website while reading something, tried it myself and realised that it can work for some. Get a small item that can induce pain on yourself, but nothing like a knife or pair of scissors or anything like that. A peg is what I use. A rubber band it may be for some. When you feel like harming yourself, use the item to give you short and quick pain. I use the peg by placing it on one of my fingers or an area on my hand, and leaving it there until it takes an effect on my actual bones. A rubber band can be put around somebody's wrist or on an area of the arm, and can be pulled and released to give pain in that area. I'm not completely sure on whether or not this will work for some, but it definitely helped me. Keep in mind that this shouldn't always be the solution; it's only temporary. \n\nHopefully - just hopefully - these can help somebody. I'm trying my best to break out of this, and maybe someone else can too. I know this isn't a lot but it's all I can offer. ", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Mainly because I was a bit scared of the pain. I really really hate myself and it looked like a good option to take my frustration out. But I was scared.\nLast night, I had an argument with my girlfriend. We'll, not like an argument but she telling me that she felt bad I didn't comment on the picture she posted and me apologising. It's not her fault thought that she felt bad. She has issues due to her childhood, her parents didn't give her the attention she deserved at that time, and it makes her scared that I'll do the same. But it made me hate myself even more. I was angry at me for being so careless. Even after one whole year, I failed to realise how important it was for her. And fucked up and made her feel so bad. She said that she thinks I don't understand her, and it hurts like hell.\nSo after she slept, I got a knife. I tried to cut on my arm, the other side of the wrist where the veins are not visible, because I was scared. I did sanitize everything first. The skin was thich or maybe the knife was blunt, it took a few strikes to draw blood. I did a few more slashes to make it a bit deep. It was honestly such a huge relief. I never expected it to actually feel this good. Just squeezing the wound and watching the blood. I felt nice. It was like punishing myself for my mistakes and for the way I am. Then, after a while, I cleaned it up, put a bandaid and changed into a full t-shirt. I haven't told anyone, and I don't want to as well.

Have been dealing with an ED for just about as long. \n\nI have a very loving family and great friends (sadly none of them live around me anymore, shout out to adulthood.) But I don\u2019t want to burden them with all of this because they worry about me enough as it is. My parents, however, have been in denial about my mental health since I first confessed to them that I was struggling so out of guilt and just their lack of understanding, I am trying to get help all on my own for this. \n\nFor me, I started cutting in middle school. I stopped for a while in high school when I made friends/joined clubs/got a job. I got bad again freshman year of college bc the change was hard for me. Stopped again sophomore year when I made some new good friends/got into my first relationship and was happy. At this point i thought i had stopped cutting for good. \n\n(Don\u2019t want to elaborate on this part too much, but basically the relationship was extremely toxic and I didn\u2019t realize it until it ended.)\n\nBeginning of last year my depression got bad again and out of nowhere got diagnosed with three different anxiety disorders. (I was NOT used to anxiety at all, by the way, i\u2019ve always been a really relaxed, calm person. So suddenly having panic attacks every day and literally being afraid of my own brain was so hard to deal with and still is.) \n\nI relapsed. Stayed clean for a bit again. but then I got dumped on Christmas Eve. It wasn\u2019t the trigger and I don\u2019t miss the person at all, I just miss the feeling of actually feeling something for someone and not being alone. I feel so lonely all the time. I do not leave my house besides going to class/work. The few friends I do have here are in relationships/have so much to do and no free time. My mental health has gotten so bad I had to take time off of school and am now not graduating on time. I work 30+ hours a week because its (thankfully) the only distraction I have and I really like my coworkers but my anxiety prevents me from functioning like an actual human being so half the time I just take an adderall, shut down/focus on my job, and get too in my head to really talk to them/get close to anyone. Which is the most frustrating thing to me because I want friends and a social life again SO bad but I am literally incapable of that now because all I do is panic. And i\u2019m not sleeping, barely eating, and literally cannot leave my bed without taking stimulants. \n\nAbout a month ago I went out with some friends and had a really good night but got too blacked out drunk and woke up the next morning to bloody sheets and my wrist all hacked up. Do not remember it at all, but I guess I got home and decided I wanted to start cutting again. It was terrifying because it was my wrists and I usually NEVER cut on my wrists bc i hated the questions people asked so I would usually just cut my legs. But since then, I do nothing but cut everywhere now. I know my coworkers/roomates/others have noticed the bandages but are not saying anything and i\u2019m over here always overthinking about the worst possible scenarios as to what they must think of me.  \n\nMy manger pulled me aside today because I overslept (due to me literally collapsing of exhaustion after not sleeping for three days) and was late to work, which i had also done earlier last week. And she expressed her concerns and gave me resources my job offers for help for me, but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m ready to try getting help again bc it\u2019s never worked in the past and the only thing I want to do is kill myself.  I\u2019m just so past the point of wanting to get better because I\u2019ve been like this for so long and it\u2019s just getting worse. I don\u2019t get better. So I don\u2019t see the point in therapy. \n\nI am so numb to life and I hate myself so much. I feel like i\u2019m letting everyone down and can\u2019t even tell them. And now i\u2019m over here thinking that everyone at work thinks i\u2019m a basket case bc they know about most of my bad habits/are the only people who see me every day. \n\nMy anxiety is so bad because I cut, but the only thing that helps ease my anxiety is cutting and I don\u2019t know what to do. \n", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

We started dating almost 10 months ago, one of the happiest couples I have ever seen.

At the end of the summer, her depression and anxiety REALLY kicked in. Before that, there wasn't much negativity at all. The first relapse at the beginning of the school year was a huge hit for me. I had never even been acquainted with anyone with depression (let alone someone I love so much as her), and I had no idea how to deal with it. I felt completely helpless, especially because my parents-and partially I- were contributing to it. I sort of had to rely on a friend I had met through her who had been talking to her for quite some time before that. (They had helped each other through hard times before.) The second relapse was very similar, with the same person helping.  Around that time I was able to recognize that I would have to learn to help, or else she would be unable to deal with my problems on top of hers. I've done research and read numerous articles and blogs and anything in the mix that I could find to do any research I can, but none of it really seems to work. Based on my experience I have been starting to get quite a bit of it. But in certain subjects, (especially self harm) I still have trouble dealing with it.

It is basically a marine biology based camp with a lot of water activities such as scuba diving, free diving, sailing, boardsailing, etc. and vector that it\u2019s like always booked full on the first session of camp. For some imagery you have to sign up online about a few months or a year in advance and you need to fill out a lot of paperwork and medical related things. It is required to get a check up and a doctor to sign a form saying your okay to go to camp nothing contagious basically.\n        Here is what worries me, I have to go to that doctors appointment soon when my mom remembers we need that form signed eventually. On the high possibility I might need to take a shot... I have a few concerns for obvious reasons. Once they would pull up that sleeve high enough to upper arm from the angle generally in front of me it is pretty clear you see some dark thin lines in rows where scars have formed. \n          Assuming my mother would be sitting down watching me as this happens generally in front of me this is problematic not only from the secret gone but from... letting specifically my mother know that. \n           Backstory on why my mother knowing about this is a BAD idea:\n            You see, here\u2019s how my mom is. She isn\u2019t the worst but can get problematic quite often... \nidk most of my friends are abused by their parents and I hear stories and comments on if I mention mine so I\u2019m so sorry if I offend anyone for I guess ranting of how this is a problem to me in a way.

That\u2019s great and all but I honestly don\u2019t need it anymore, in that way I just want to be independent and left alone. I really do appreciate the things she buys me, the house, the food ect. but this extra things I don\u2019t. If I dare express actual more honest opinions of her she freaks out, gets loud, tears up, and just can\u2019t understand that I don\u2019t naturally like her a whole lot from past reasons and present but I respect her. When we get in fights and she actually knows she\u2019s the one who did something wrong she\u2019ll just buy me a bunch of things. In arguments she uses things she gives of buys me against me as-well. She once threw a fit because I bought my suicidal friends (the ones I spend a lot of my time taking care of) Christmas gifts and didn\u2019t do her the same. She didn\u2019t know that of course but you get the image that those people somewhat needed that sort of thing in their life at this point. My mother only ever these days do what I want to do to win me over or something and basically spoils me with anything I want if I ask. She always tries to pry herself into my personal life in conversations or getting jealous and pissy over how I spend a lot of my time on friends or people I take care of and not her. Once she found out I was taking care of people at night because my grandmother caught me awake at 4am and she forced \u2018bedtimes\u2019 to around 8 and 9pm and took away my phone and laptop so I couldn\u2019t do anything about it. This horrified me so I never told her anything about my friends ever since that one incident as that person could have easily taken their life with little to no one else to stop them in that period of time. She told me to just leave them and finally compromised to only talk to them at school (most people would never vent like that in broad daylight wtf??? what good will that do?) She once got so mad she threatened, \u201c Alright well if this faint is tRaSh what other family is any better?\u201d (because I am adopted from China ever since I was 10 months old) That brief time I was sugar coated honest to her, yeah she took everything I said and twisted my words. There have been fights between me and her before where my mom overreacts or something noticeable in front of other family like my brother, aunt, and dad and they know and some have said to me, \u201cYeah I don\u2019t know why she did that\u201d or from brother, \u201cThat\u2019s f\u2014\u2014d up\u201d I can\u2019t force myself to \u2018love\u2019 her the way she does with me and I wish she could understand that but time and time again she won\u2019t and I give up trying it\u2019s been a year now. \n        Back onto topic;\n         I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll even be able to hide them. I could use makeup of course but even though they\u2019re on inside of upper arm and  a little on upper thigh if they swab too close to it with the disinfectant wipe before injecting a shot, it\u2019s game over for me. Plus the chance that the makeup will fade or rub off enough for someone to notice. I don\u2019t even know if makeup will even work, even though they aren\u2019t that deep tiny creases appear if I twist my arm a certain way.

I couldn\u2019t stop staring at it. And as twisted as this sounds, the way it looked made me feel euphoric and I instantly thought about incorporating it as a new method. \nThe thing is, i have burned myself on accident before, but never so close to my wrist and never in a way that made it look like a cut.\nI wasn\u2019t able to get the temptation out of my head, so a few days later, I used the iron again and attempted to place it over the same burn to freshen it up but, being the scaredy cat that I am, I didn\u2019t do it as well as I wanted to. Over a few days it began to form a small scab that I eventually picked and bled. I have done the same method on my thighs over old scars and the red dashes that form after a few hours resemble self-harm scars and I can\u2019t get over it. \n\nI don\u2019t self-harm as often as I used to, but this has left me feeling inclined to do so just for the heck of it.  \n\nI don\u2019t know why I felt the need to share but I needed to get it off my chest.

Won't it get better?\n\nI just fear her or others will find me.. and I result in cutting again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf my idea sounds idiotic to you, could you suggest one?", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I\u2019ve been cutting for over a year now and it has gotten worse and worse. When I first started it began with liking the feeling of punching a concrete wall and drawing blood and feeling the pain pulsating in my hand as it started to swell. Then I went to punching sharp leaves on this tree in my school that scraped my hands up. Then one day I found a pencil sharpener, unscrewed the blade, and cut my leg.  The cuts started small but I wanted to see more blood, and deeper cuts. I\u2019ve been depressed and somewhat suicidal for the past year and a half and the cutting really began a year ago. At first my reasons were to punish myself for how stupid I was for flunking out of my expensive private collage for drug offenses that I was caught for and I felt that I deserved the pain. A couple months down the road I was cutting all over my legs and I started to almost want my roommate to notice them. Initially it was all on my thighs but once I wanted him to take notice I went further down my leg till I couldn\u2019t wear shorts to work because I didn\u2019t want my bosses to say shit about it or to see it. My roommate saw eventually and we had a talk and he was comforting but that didn\u2019t stop it. Right now I have roughly over 300-400 cuts and 200-300 visible scars on me. My parents saw them recently and they flipped out. Right now I\u2019m laying in my bed writing this post whilst my legs are bleeding. A week ago I broke a month long period where I didn\u2019t cut at all. I told myself I was done doing it, that I could stop forever because I was in control of myself. Then one night it happened again and then the next day, and the next, and the next. I don\u2019t want to cut. I don\u2019t wanna do this forever. Yet I love to see my scars. Some of them will be there forever, and I hate that, but then at the same time I love it because it shows my struggles that I\u2019ve been through. A few months ago I stood on the roof of a 20 story building and I almost jumped but I didn\u2019t obviously. That was my first ever \u201csuicide attempt\u201d.

First of all this is a lot to read and might be triggering for some people so please read with caution if you\u2019re sensitive and likely to get triggered from themes of heartbreak and self harm.\n\nI was fifteen it was summer and got to this new boarding school I got invited to. I lived in a apartment with seven other really cool guys who became like family to me in the time I\u2019ve spent there and the things I went through.\n\nIn the first few weeks we got to know everybody else in our grade we all got drafted from different schools and didn\u2019t really know any one of us. I instantly noticed a girl, let\u2019s call her Mary, who stood out to me. She was very pretty and seemed to laugh all the time. At that time though I really didn\u2019t like her that much. She seemed fake and it seemed like being popular was everything to her. I don\u2019t like people like that so I really stayed away.\n\n One day she and a few of her friends came over to our apartment or flat. It really sound more luxurious than it really was. It was more like staying at a Motel on a class trip and we shared two showers as eight boys how most of you probably know have to have a good daily hygiene routine in order to not be unbearable to stand next to. She made her typical fuss about being excited to be at the school and to meet us. I showed them my room and she started looking at my drawings. I had a pretty bad mood at this point in my life already and drew a lot. Little did I know the way I felt at that time were first signs of what was to come. It was like she was really genuinely interested in them and genuine wouldn\u2019t be the word I would describe her  usual behaviour. For some reason that moment stuck to me.\n\nA few months later autumn rolled in and it got colder. That one day she and a few friends came over for some reason she and I got talking and it ended up in a pillow fight. After that my perspective on her had changed to an interest in me. Literally only a sexual interest cause she was so disconnected from herself and presented herself in public like a typical basic girl.\n\nSo we spent a lot of time together after that and slowly but surely our relationships friends took a different turn. We started holding hands while lying on their couch watching tv. And that turned into her lying on my chest and me having my arm around her and snuggled tightly together. I was incredibly happy that someone as pretty as her seemed into me. \n\nWhen we were alone in her room for some reason I don\u2019t know we started talking. And slowly her mask dropped and she revealed who she really was. A girl broken by her ex, insecure and fragile. I fell in love with her that day.\n\nFast forward a few weeks and our school organised a ball. Everybody dressed nicely and fashionably. Before the dance ball was supported me and Mary hung out together. It might seem ridiculous to you but it was very important to me. She stemmed to be very tense so I massaged her. Mary\u2019s head and shoulders between my legs and she fell asleep on me just resting her pretty head on my legs. You can\u2019t imagine how happy I was. So when it came to the ball me being the dumb idiot i was, scared about my own worth being worthy of her or making myself look stupid didn\u2019t dance with her. A really good girl friend of mine came in the hall where we danced crying. Her boyfriend got drunk with his pals and was in no condition to join her. Ed Sheerans thinking out loud started playing and I looked over to a really pissed looking Mary, but I couldn\u2019t just let my friend cry alone. So I danced with her ( my friend ). I wanted Mary to  come to my room a little before the ball ended thinking something might happen but she didn\u2019t turn up. \n\nI promised myself I\u2019d tell her I love her, but when I tried to she had already told me minutes before that she made out with a guy that was way hotter than me, not in that way but he really was way hotter than me.\nI got scared but I told her about me cutting myself. I started when I met her, that I didn\u2019t tell her. She told me she would\u2019ve found out sooner or later anyway.\n\nI told her I loved her shortly after that talk though but all she did was sit in front of me crying and saying she can\u2019t right now. I was destroyed and went to my room where I puked for the next thirty minutes straight.\n\nLater that month, I had told her I was fine with waiting for her to be ready, she invited me to sleep over at her room. I still remember that night clear as day. Her laying their in her huge red sweater cuddling at my side and falling asleep peacefully little spoon at my side. \n\nBut from that day on she became very distant to me.\n\nWhen we had our Christmas event a girl in my grade played \u201clet her go\u201d and I had to cry so I stormed out.\nLater that night under tears I told her I needed space and that I couldn\u2019t wait anymore.\n\nThe rest that followed was an alcohol addiction that started to form before I broke it up a nicotine addiction serious self harm that got worse and worse the longer I stayed away from her and it couldn\u2019t get better since every time I tried to rekindle anything we had she turned it down saying she doesn\u2019t want to hurt me and later that she just couldn\u2019t love me. I stayed a long time in a clinic after my parents found my suicide note and a couple of friends saved me from killing myself. It\u2019s been a year now that I\u2019m in recovery and half a year since I last self harmed.\n\nI think I still love her but it was toxic for me, for her. \nAnd even if I wanted to get back to her she has a boyfriend now who by the way is not better looking subjectively of course, nor does he perhaps understand what she\u2019s been through. And even if she didn\u2019t have a boyfriend she\u2019s made it very clear to me that for a reason she also doesn\u2019t know she just can\u2019t love me.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I know that I cut because I was hurt and I couldn't tell anyone that because my parents wouldn't understand, or they will try to blame me as an attention whore.\n\nI stopped cutting for a year or so, then by the time I was 15, my parents divorced, I lived with my mom who I barely knew at the time because she was never home. Living with her and her boyfriend stressed me out, so I depended on the internet and met some messed up folks who also stressed me out. My mom and her boyfriend thought that I was too obsessed with the internet. With all those stresses, I cut again and has been cutting ever since then. \n\nI dated this boy when I was 16-17 and he hated it when I cut. So I stopped cutting, instead, I lashed out on him with threats of breaking up and he would respond with:\" If you do, I will kill myself.\" so with that, we ended up dating for two years and he broke up with me. So I cut again, this time way harder with my slit.\n\nI am now dating a recovering sex addict and he has been helping me to recover as well. However, when I have the urge to relapse, I can't explain to him why I want to cut. The more he tells me to get some help and give me materials to distract myself, the more passionate my urge becomes. My therapist asked me why did I cut and I couldn't give her an answer.\n\nHere is what I think when I have the urge; I feel like I am maybe getting more attention from my boyfriend and people, so maybe I cut for more attention? But I know that I am not an attention whore, so I would punish myself for thinking like this. So I cut. But my boyfriend wouldn't like it and I feel so bad for hurting him. So I should punish myself. I shouldn't have met my boyfriend in the first place, now I am dragging him all around with my problem, so I deserve some punishment. Etc\n\nNo matter what I think, I will still end up with 'I deserve to be punished'. I am writing this because I can't live like this forever, at the same time I don't know why I deserve to be better.

Writing is one of my hobbies, so I do it very frequently, but it's all online, however I tell her that a friend of mine may be able to give it to me because I gave them a version that I actually wrote on paper. She now thinks that in our next session I will have a full story for her to read.\n\nMy therapist is really good at picking up things and linking one to another, like normal therapists. Without a doubt, when I show her my writing, she will ask me questions about self-harm and if I was ever bullied, and even if I avoid them, she will most likely come to the conclusion that I do it. I don't want her to know this though, as I'd probably be given more treatment and tasks then I already have to deal with. \n\nShould I give her the story? I'm really afraid of what she will think of it, and I don't ever want her to see my scars. I know that I should, but I just can't, not now anyway - it'd be too much. \n\nFor the story, it's actually fanfiction and is on Wattpad, a place that I don't enjoy being a part of because of the sheer amount of smut (inappropiate stories that normally include sex).

People that have had issues involving self injury shouldn't be held at fault, either, since it's tied to mental illness.\n\nWith it being tied to mental illness, there are some things we shouldn't bring up or say to people struggling. \n\nStarting with pushing people away for doing it/threatening to abandon them unless they stop. Referencing the list I made earlier, things like that induce emotional overload and only make it harder for them to stop. Instead, try and be supportive of them. When you find out a close friend or family member does it, don't shame them, but instead make sure they feel comfortable and understood. Encourage their recovery and treat milestones (such as one month clean/a year clean/ resisting urges in a stressful situation) like accomplishments. Make sure they know they're loved no matter what they're going through.\n\nSecond is making fun of people for it. back to the hypothetical situation of finding out a friends partakes in these behaviors. Making fun of it and treating it like it's nothing leads to the shame and grief stage. Support is vital, and people need to know you have their back in times like these.\n\nThere are plenty of other things to avoid around self-harmers, but I'd love to open up a discussion with reddit. If anyone has any corrections, feel free to comment your thoughts, opinions, arguments, I'm very open to discussion.\n\nInternational Suicide Prevention Line: 1-800-273-8255 ", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Lately I've been cutting everyday and have been getting a lot worse with it. If you rlly care as to why i do it you can read some old posts about it. But just to sum up i had to show my arms, which luckily i hadn't cut in about a week but got away with stuff about my thighs. I talked about it (aka lying and being vague) and visited the nurse. After that i was upset and also *raging* at whoever thought it was a smart idea to tell the school. Later that day my friend who goes to another school was mad because i was cutting and wasn't giving her a reason or an explanation on why i do it and how i feel about it.\n\nI don't really voice my opinion on self harm as i just don't really care and am fine with all the cons that come with it. But my friend i guess just wasn't having it and **apparently** thought it was a good idea to CALL MY SCHOOL to report me.  Now i called this girl my best friend. I told her my life, my feeling, my everything, and she told me hers. We where the closest two people could be. She was family and yet she stabbed me in the back all cause she thought she was helping me. \\\\\n\nWhat she doesn't understand is, instead of arguing with me about it and telling my school she could've been like \"bro, i know its hard but ill be here to support you and you can vent when you need to.\" THAT'S WHAT I NEEDED not people fucking forcing me to show my arms and call my parents (who literally already knew btw) and my friend yelling at me about how \"I should bE mOrE OpEn, and Just TeLl mE yOuR fEeLiNgs.\"   NONONO N.

She knows i hated that experience as i told her everything about it. And maybe you don't understand because you don't cut or maybe because your seeking help and/or getting better, but what she did in my opinion was wrong. It didn't help it made things worse. Shes honestly fucking stupid cause the school didn't do anything besides call my parents so i have that going for me. I know i sound harsh but im still mad at her and for the most part blocked her out of  my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShes no longer my friend and I'm not mad about it.

Little brother is cutting and a social worker is getting involved", "author": "ThatRandomPersonIG", "self_text": "I don't know if this is the right place for this post, but its the closest thing I can find, so sorry if I'm misusing this subreddit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome time ago, my little brother told my parents that he had been cutting himself for a span of a couple of months. One of his friends at school noticed and--thank god--told the school counselor who said that she would have a conference with the family if he didn't confess. This came as a complete shock to everyone. My little brother has a lot of friends who he hangs out with often, is involved with a youth group and had even recently started getting involved with the school baseball team. We were all completely blindsided as we didn't see what could possibly lead him to self-harm. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother immediately looked for help. She scheduled a meeting with a therapist recommended by our pediatrician and took him to some appointments. He was pissed as he insisted that he didn't need help and that it was all behind him (he claims to have stopped cutting around October). My parents didn't care about his anger though as they insisted that they wanted to address the core of the issue so that he wouldn't resort to self-harm again. We took him to his appointment in February and, to our surprise, the therapist said that she didn't see any immediate danger and would leave the option of therapy up to him. He said he didn't need or want any so, although we all thought there needed to be some kind of further action, we let things sit there. We figured that, since a professional hadn't seen any urgency to the issue, we were probably over exaggerating in some way and decided to just keep an eye out for any future red flags. We also didn't want to end up causing more harm than good by forcing him to attend therapy that he doesn't want and that the therapist doesn't deem necessary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe thought that would be the end of any outside involvement, but just today my mom received a phone call from a social worker asking to set up a visitation for tomorrow. This has me a bit nervous as I don't know what this means, whether they suspect some kind of negligence or abuse of my parents towards my little bro, or if its just a routine thing. Furthermore, I technically shouldn't know any of this as my little brother made my parents promise not to tell me about the cutting and has refused to mention it to me himself. The only reason I know is because my parents felt that such a big thing shouldn't be hidden from me and that I should be aware so that I don't go too overboard on teasing (you know how older brothers are, we can be a pain but I would never want to do anything that triggers him or leads to anything other than his well-being). Any advice as to what I should do would be greatly appreciated. Should I worry about this visit? How can I be more supportive/helpful without letting him know that I know there's some issues with his mental health?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks to those who have read this far and to the ones that respond.

Turns out I forgot my leggings we're capris so you could see a few of the cuts on my ankle. My friend kinda stared at my ankles for just a second too long and I was like fuck fuck fuck oh no and she said \"did you draw on you ankles?\" Or something like that and I kinda tried to say something about drawing on my arm and my hands (because there is always marker doodles all over them) and she kinda looked back at my ankles and I just mumbled \"but,,, uhh no they're actually cuts.\" And she went \"okay, I won't bring it up again.\" And I almost cried I was so worried but she instead treated me like a human being and ughhh I just felt a huge relief. \n\nAlso another \"super fun\" thing happened in health class. The teacher asked us to write one thing we would change about our selves. We couldn't show anyone else except him. He read them out to us later ( without saying who wrote it) and he wasn't surprised most people said their face, body, height, blah blah blah.

It's been 9 years since last time I did it, but the urge is been so great these past days. I quit smoking again a few weeks ago and I lack an effective coping mechanism for stressful situations.

I didn't bleed.  I didn't make any marks that stood out in any way from the other ones.  I was only able to make one tiny part of one mark that showed anything other than a scrape, and that's just because it crossed an already existing mark.  I feel like I couldn't fucking get it up.  Did I manage to self-sabotage when it comes to literal self-harm?  I guess all my brain needed to know was that it gave me satisfaction.\n\nI think there are two logistical reasons, both location.  I usually walk, then cut at my destination.  Tonight was unexpectedly cold, and I'd gone to a social event earlier, which tired me out mentally.  My back hurts, too.  I thus tried to make the walk as short as possible.  It was windy at my destination.  Bad environment.  Then there's the location of the cut.  For about a week I cut on my hand daily.  I started in the center, then I think I realized that it's really hard (for me) to cut effectively in the middle of my palm.  Stuff gets in the way.  So I gradually moved to the peripheries.  Then when school started again I didn't have the energy to cut.  So I used that as an excuse to quit something I never really wholeheartedly began.  Now, since I made some marks that have actually stuck around for more than a few days on the peripheries, I decided to try the middle again.  Doesn't fucking work.  Okay, let's try the peripheries.  Doesn't fucking work.  What's my fucking problem?\n\nMy mom told me that I'd have to get a shot sometime last week. I was avoiding my arms because of that.  The shot didn't happen.  I can't ask about it, or she'll be suspicious.  This could happen at any time and I'd just be sitting there with marked up arms.  I think if I went for the arms, I'd be able to do it.

{"post_id": "b28sss", "created_utc": 1552850259, "title": "A long road to self harm", "author": "boomadonna", "self_text": "I grew up in an abusive household. My dad had a short fuse and when angry, he would be verbally and physically violent to my mom and me. My mom was codependent and poisoned my mind in many different ways. As a child, I would always interfere with their fighting, coming to my moms aid. I often mediated between them. I had little to no room to express my own emotions. I didn\u2019t self harm during this period, but I would sometimes tie a bed sheet tightly around my arm or leg until I felt emotional relief. The act itself felt involuntary and almost subconscious.\n\nThey divorced when I was 14. My mom left with another man. My dad quickly met someone else and stayed with her often. I lived back and forth between both houses, although I was alone a lot. I was kicked out / ran away from my dads house a few times. I sometimes stayed with friends. I coped by becoming a responsible \u201cadult\u201d as a child. I held down jobs. Learned skills. Saved money. Took care of myself. In my mind, I had to be responsible to survive (at that moment and in the future). Being angsty or emotional or lost never felt like an option as a teenager. \n\nI continued to take care of myself and have been successful doing so in to my 20s and 30s (I\u2019m 33 now). However...\n\nI eventually broke down (around 31 years old). I experienced a 1-2 year depressive episode. I started seeing a therapist. It helped in some ways but never fully relieved me the depression. This continued until about 6 months ago when I completely broke. I started binge drinking every night at home. I isolated myself. It felt like I was giving up on any efforts to get better. \n\nAnd then I finally acknowledged and acted on this deep hidden urge - i self harmed. Every night for 2 weeks, I\u2019d cut myself on my leg 3 or 4 times. I\u2019d settle. I\u2019d calm. I\u2019d feel relief. Doing it felt so natural, yet deliberate self harm isn\u2019t something I was familiar with (although I had been unconsciously sabotaging myself in different ways for many years).  Cutting felt so clean and simple. It felt like the \u201cpurest\u201d way to cope. It also felt like in some ways like - the violence of it was a reflection of the severity of my depression and pain from the past. Like it was my way of finally getting to express the hurt I held in favor of protecting my mom, or learning to survive as an independent teenager.\n\nI confessed this to my therapist and she urged me to do a two week partial hospitalization program, which I did. There, I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and put on a low dose SSRI. The combination of the program, continuing therapy, and  medication have been very helpful and the severity of my depression has been greatly.\n\nI\u2019m writing this today because I feel low. I\u2019m moderately depressed. The feeling has been growing this last week. The thought of cutting keeps crossing my mind. I\u2019m pretty sure I won\u2019t, almost positive. I just wanted to acknowledge it somehow - so that\u2019s why I\u2019m writing and posting this. I appreciate this outlet. ", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

One of my closest friends was there and he could tell that I wasn't doing all that great through the night and asked me every now and then how I was doing.\n\nWe were downstairs around 1:30 am playing some games (I was just watching) and I felt a little more comfortable than I was. But out of the blue, for no apparent reason, I REALLY badly wanted to cut again. I went into the host's upstairs bathroom and sat there for roughly 30-45 min alone. I was just breaking and I forced myself to text my friend who was at the party. I told them that I needed help and they came in and sat with me for an hour or so. We just started talking about random stories and it made me feel so much better. \n\nThey're the only one that knows the full extent of my self-harm and metal issues so I almost always go to them for support. I hate doing it because (despite how many times they've told me the opposite) I feel like I'm such a burden and always talk about that stuff with them. Despite how many times they deny it I know its true. I always feel so bad immediately after I reach out to them. They shouldn't have to be there. It just really helps me when I talk to someone.\n\n I know tonight is going to be worse than last night because tonight I'm alone. And tonight I have things that I can use to do harm to myself.

I had to constantly keep my cuts and scars under wraps throughout high school. Now in college, I work out a lot and with this fresh start, I've been wearing a lot of crop tops and similar-skin bearing shirts -- but I have a ton of really obvious self-harm scars on my midriff, and so they're pretty visible whenever it's warm out. I worked really fucking hard to be comfortable with them being visible, and now I don't even think about them. Some of my friends have asked, but they're chill about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut then I realized, now that I've stopped hiding them, do I want people to ask? Am I looking for them to be interested in me, and to pay attention to me especially because of them? Sometimes I feel like I do, just because sometimes I want to be able to tell my side of the story -- only a couple people have asked, but I'm sure the rest are filling in the blanks. At the same time, if anyone ever asks about them, I laugh it off and say vaguely they're really old scars, and that anything that they're thinking but don't want to say is probably right. I don't think I've ever said the words 'self harm' out loud before in my life. But is this asking for attention? Do I want their attention, by wearing crop tops? By letting my scars show and no longer hiding them, is that bad? Will people think that it's bad? Should I stop wear crops?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess this is a vent, sorry about it. There's also nothing I can do about the scars, and I would never want to change them. So I guess even if it does look like I'm looking for attention by having them visible, I'm going to have to live with it if I want to dress how I want and not be controlled by them as I was earlier.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Of course, a few weeks ago, my girlfriend and I separated. I feel like a little bitch for cutting over it because we weren't together for long enough for it to matter, but I really think I was falling in love with her.\n\nI still talk to her, so I guess we are friends, even though I hate that. But I asked her why we broke up the other day, and she literally told me that she died inside. She said that she really didn't want to be in a relationship. And I know it was me, I must have killed her emotionally. She didn't have this problem before it and now she does, so I did it, I destroyed her.\n\nRecently, I confessed to my online friends that I was cutting and that recently I was falsifying some facts about my cutting. They started making fun of me and yelling at me for thinking I could manipulate them, and I fucking deserve that because I did. I manipulated them and I don't deserve them as friends.\n\nA while back, while I was still dating my ex, I was in school and I decided to start self harming because I felt bad for my GF. She was going through some rough stuff and I felt the need to convert the emotional pain into physical. At that point, it was just scratching with a blue pen, however the ink didn't come out, so there were just red marks. Later that day, I was sitting at lunch with my friends and I positioned my arm in a way where the marks were decently visible, hoping someone to notice. I feel awful for doing that because it was just playing my friends and they don't deserve that. I feel fucking fake. I feel like I fake a ton of shit like that. I hate it so damn much. So, they notice, and later I talk to my friend about it again and say that pain causes a high. This caused my friends to call my parents and tell them that they thought I was self harming. My parents sat me down and asked me. I showed them and said it was just a pen. They assumed the red marks were ink marks instead of scratch marks because all I said was \"pen\" not \"blue pen\". So, it kind of blew over.\n\nI feel like garbage. I betrayed my girlfriend by destroying her life by literally just being with her, I destroyed both groups of friends by lying to and manipulating them, and I didn't and continue to not tell my parents about my SH. I feel alone and at fault. I began to contemplate suicide recently. I know I could never do it, but it feels like an option.\n\nStressing over these petty issues makes me feel so damn fake because I know people on here and all around have much worse problems in their lives. Stupid me feels the need to cut over some rejection. God damn it.\n\nI have patches of my life that are happy. I know I don't deserve that happiness and I know my problems are trivial because people with real problems don't get that privilege of being happy, even just for small patches.\n\nIdk guys thanks for reading if you made it to the end.

That's obviously fucked up, but I think it's how many of us are.\n\nI decided that I actually *want* to bleed instead of just half-assing it and feeling like shit after like I did last night.  I walked to my childhood school playground.  I'd decided that I'd yeet my fingers horizontally.  I'd tried yeeting them vertically this Monday and Tuesday; my knuckles got in the way and it didn't look nearly as badass as I'd wanted.\n\nSo I yeeted my index, middle, and pinky fingers.  I felt like I only had the energy to do three, and for some reason the pinky felt like a better option than the ring or thumb.  The first cut, on my index, bled more than I'd anticipated.  I guess I've gotten less timid with my blade.  Hooray.  I don't remember it hurting that much.\n\nOn the walk home I listened to Neutral Milk Hotel and sang all the way.  It felt great.  I haven't been listening to them very much, and I felt like I'd *earned* that, after actually cutting.  I'm pretty sure my sweater is stained with blood, as I clenched my hand in it to try to stop the bleeding so I wasn't straight up bleeding when I got home.  It's a red sweater, though, so I can't *see* anything.  But I'll know it's there.\n\nIt feels really good to not have failed at this task once again.

Lately, I've had this sick fantasy of threatening that the next person who tells me to shut up will get a paper with their name written in my blood. I've never done it and I never will because I know that's abusive and could hurt people. I care very deeply about most people I meet. Like I said, I've never cut to hurt anyone else before. I also don't cut deep. I don't know how to stop this thought. When I think of it, it just makes me more unhappy and frustrated since it's an itch I can't scratch and I feel guilty for even coming up with it. Has anyone else experienced this? What should I do?

I phoned him in tears and never asked him to come over, but once or twice he did, at his own suggestion.  Everything he has done for me has been wonderful, but always at his own suggestion, all I ever do is tell him how I feel and then he decides whether to do something about it or just sit on the end of the phone.  I had been fine for a while, but really needed to talk again.  We scheduled a time; however, at very short notice he said he couldn't do it.  We argued for a bit because while I understood, he couldn't tell me when we could talk, and I was so scared at being alone that night.  He's had to cancel before and I've been ok with it, it was just this one time.  Then I realised how many times in the last few months that we've had to postpone talking for 4-6 weeks at a time because he isn't free.  That upset me, and now I'm feeling guilty because he got really upset with me when I told him that.\n\nWe're talking later this week about how we've upset each other and I'm scared of losing him.  He's been a rock - completely on his own terms, but he's still been a rock.\n\nI understand that he's probably emotionally tired, but I always told him that we should only talk if he's emotionally able to.  Every time I phoned or messaged and then apologised after, he said I had nothing to apologise for, and said that's what friends are for.  He kept stressing that it's exactly what friends are for.  Now that we've upset each other, he's saying that he's been too accommodating towards me and that I've asked too much.\n\nFrom his point of view, his time is limited.\n\nFrom my point of view, needing someone when you want to die trumps **some** of the times he's had to postpone.  It feels like everything has been completely on his own terms, and now I either be ok with that or I lose him.  If I lose him I'll have lost everyone I've ever tried to lean on, and my best friend in the whole world.  He's been telling me this whole time that it's exactly what friends are for, but now saying that he's been too accommodating towards me.  It's so damaging for me at the minute.  How do I deal with this?", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I had a fun weekend away with my theatre group, but I was too exhausted to really enjoy it, and in the evening I had a confrontational conversation with someone and it caused me so much mental turmoil that I ran up to my room and started hyperventilating and cutting. Not deep, not anything long-lasting, but still. Someone noticed, and it became this big thing, that people got afraid that I was suicidal (I'm not, I was in a lot of pain, but I really want to live) and that people felt insecure about their own safety. The following week they talked with eachother about it and decided that it was best that I left the group (they told me today). And even though I can think rationally about it, like: some people just don't get it, and maybe i wasn't meant to be in that group, it still hurts a lot.

This is what I've done for a few years up until recently. I've began trying to grow my nails out (I'm a nail biter) and discovered I could rake my nails down my arm and it would be much more discreet, while still accomplishing the same goal.\n\nYesterday, however, I got in to it with some family and at some point I ran a broken pencil down my arm. I will admit, it hurt quite a bit, and it's far from a good choice... But that's what makes it so infuriating.\n\nI know it's not going to make anything better, and I know everybody thinks its stupid for me to do, but I still do it. It's almost like a habit in my subconscious.\n\nI just feel like everything I do just fucks someone over in some form or fashion and then I feel guilty and the only way I know how to take this guilt and anger out is through aggression. It fucks me up and I don't like it. I rarely talk about this to any friends because I don't want to run them off, and any hobbies I try to partake in (I play guitar and draw) just piss me off more because it's not perfect.\n\nIt's like a switch flips in my head sometimes that leads me to all of these negative emotions and I don't know how to just chill and solve a conflict rationally in the heat of the moment.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated, and thank you guys for reading.\n\ntl;dr - I'm having a hard time with taking any frustrations out in a rational, thought-out way without hurting myself physically or potentially hurting others mentally.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I'm thinking of doing a weekly therapy thread thing that everyone can share their lives and problems and everyone can help them in return! This one is kinda late, but I think I'll be making one each Sunday, and we can discuss the whole week and everything that happened. \n\nOkay so on Monday or Tuesday, I was in math class and my friend saw my hand and the cuts on it and just asked what happened, a kinda just looked at him and looked away, and he mumbled \"cuts?\" And I nodded and he said he was sorry. I told him he didn't need to apologise but he said he felt bad and didn't know what I was going through. And I told him he didn't need to worry. Also a girl that is a mutual, but not really a friend, was talking about her hands shaking a lot, and I held my hands up bc they shake a lot too. She grabbed my hand and just looked at it and then back at me, she had this really understanding look in her eyes. I felt a lot better after that happened. \n\nDuring my study period, my advisor asked what happened to my hand and I said I don't know and she asked if I was scratching it and I kinda said yeah, she then changed the subject.\n\nI learned that I need to stop sh on my hands altogether because it is dangerous. It's going to take some time because I really like sh there, but I need to stop. \n\nI also feel really safe at this new school, at my other school people would shame me if they found out or try to help by taking my tools away (which doesn't help at all.) And this new school, everyone is understanding and caring and it's really made me less stressed out.\n\nThat's all for now, thank you for listening to me discuss my kinda boring life, I just need to get it off my chest.

Let\u2019s call her Sarah. Sarah is super chill and super relatable and great fun to be around and definitely a good friend and we were having a deep conversation about how she used to self harm and how she relapsed a month ago. I told her that relapse is a huge part of recovery. She jokes around a lot and is very funny. Anyway, I was feeling super stressed and super depressed one day and I cut. I told her what I had done and obviously she wouldn\u2019t be happy with me. Telling me not to do it again and that it was okay and talking to me to distract myself. A couple of days pass as usual. Not really having any deep conversations. But I have a hard day and I just felt like shit. Just felt so numb and empty I couldn\u2019t find any energy to do anything. I try to talk to Sarah but she clearly didn\u2019t notice or had her phone off. About 20 minutes of just lying on my bed feeling useless and lonely I cut. Not badly but enough. Sarah eventually texts back and doesn\u2019t even need to ask if I had self harmed. She just starts to talk to me. And I sense that she\u2019s disappointed. She then decided the only way to get me to stop is to blackmail me. Saying if I cut she\u2019ll cut. I know that she jokes around a lot and for some reason didn\u2019t think she was being serious. So I stupidly did a few little cuts to test her bluff. Oh boy wasn\u2019t she bluffing. I felt like complete shit after I saw those cuts on her arm. She said if I promise to not do it again then she won\u2019t.\nObviously I don\u2019t want her to do it again so I reluctantly agreed.

I have struggled with many things, mental health wise, and through our relationship (I was with them for over a decade) they have copied my issues.

I helped them find a phenomenal psychologist (even they said so), I told then how important and loved and beautiful they were constantly. But they always ignored my problems other than to copy. I self harmed, so they did, too. I had anorexia, so they claimed body dsymorphia. Even though none of their behaviours had demonstrated this (use to tell me how hot they knew they were, loved food, had no issues of any sort till after I was hospitalized, and after that they claimed they'd always had issues). \n\nBut, see, I have to suffer the long term consequences. They don't. I struggled with PTSD and worked hard to manage it. I an holding a good job despite still struggling. My bones are permenantly damaged. I am infertile. My scars are visible from far away. They are everywhere. I try desperately to keep quiet about all this. I try not to bring attention to it. Even though the nerve damage, the joint pain, etc. are constantly bothering me. \n\nYet they constantly recieve attention for bullshit. They're scars aren't easily visible, they are a healthy weight (as they always have been), they have no actual health issues, yet they always act like they were the worst. Most in pain. Most damaged. Even though they've lived a privileged and easy life.\n\nI'm just frustrated. Usually I brush it off, but tonight I am tired. Tired tht I spent about 14 years in a fucked relationship with them, where I cared so much and they couldn't care less (though they pretended otherwise). Where I was gaslighted and manipulated and abused by them, yet they still get to float easy while pretending it's rough seas. \nThey've never known rough seas. \nI've known nothing but. \n", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

It's basically a socially acceptable scar and I love it so much. \n\nWhat has me comparing it to self harm is the aftercare.

Unfortunately, I happened to be at school when everything went to shit. I woke up feeling awful, severely depressed. I got up, got my shit together, and went to school despite knowing that I should've stayed home because I was showing the same warning signs that I always do before an attempt. I got to school, and asked my headteacher if I could sit out of lessons for today (he knows what my mental health is like, and knows about my previous attempts), and he said I could sit out of one half of the day, but had to go to the other. At this point, I just accepted that everything was going to go haywire, and got really pissed off. Then it started. I got to the place that I go to to sit out of lessons (outside my head teachers office, which is in a staff only corridor, unless students are given permission to go down there) and just decided I wanted to die. I waited for my head teacher's meeting to end, and told him I was putting a (leaving) present in his office. It was my suicide note. I went back into the corridor, and told him it was in there, but that I'd hidden it, in order to give me enough time to do what I needed to do, and have nobody stop me in time. I told him my entire plan, and he very quickly realised that if he went into his office to find it, I'd be dead by the time he found me. He asked a teacher to watch over me while he searched, but whilst they were talking, I left. I went to one of my teachers rooms on the way, and just said bye, at which point he also realised exactly what was about to happen. He tried to call me back, but I'd already left, and went to the place that I planned on doing it. Unfortunately, the place I wanted to do it was in use by students, so I panicked and tried to go somewhere else. I had teachers all over the school looking for me, because the teacher I'd just left, put out a warning to teachers on duty that I wasn't where I was supposed to be, because obviously he wanted them to stop me. I was found after my maths teacher found me and notified everyone where I was, when I was told that I'd also had an alert from the teacher that was supposed to be keeping an eye on me that I'd gone missing. I was a mess. I didn't go to any of my lessons. They offered to send me home, but I didn't want mum to know, so I stayed. I don't know why I'm telling you this. I just regret not doing it quicker.

Anyways it\u2019s a whole stupid routine, but I really really was interested in starting out as a pharmacy technician or a surgical technician. But I don\u2019t think I could work at a job where I have my arms exposed. It\u2019s completely embarrassing and unprofessional. I don\u2019t want to be judged by my scars, I know I have the potential to go to college and work in the medical field but I\u2019m getting cold feet and now I completely feel the need to re-evaluate my life. I know tattoos are an option but I\u2019ve heard that med students can\u2019t have tattoos? Idk what to do anymore. I\u2019m just trying not to make the impulsive decision to drop out.\n\nI just want to know if I still have a chance in the medical field. I\u2019m probably being too hard on myself, but I\u2019m struggling to think rationally.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

So I\u2019m looking for reasons to stop cutting other than scaring (I don\u2019t mind it) and because other people want me to stop. Thanks for any advice, reasons or help.\n\nLong version: \nI have a hard time seeing why me cutting is so bad. I don\u2019t mean to encourage it in anyway but my cuts aren\u2019t deep and only problems they\u2019ve caused is scarring. My parents think I stopped last November and all my scars are on my ankles or on the bottom of my feet (don\u2019t do it hurts so bad) but point is they\u2019re easily hidden by socks. \n\nThe only person who knows now is my boyfriend, he is supper bothered by it. It\u2019s for him that I tried and try to stop. But I also feel bad when I do it now just cause I know it affects him too. He used to cut and stopped some years ago. Recently he cut again after a bad night and I feel responsible.\n\nOther than for my boyfriend though I don\u2019t want to stop. I can\u2019t concentrate on my work and my grades drop when I don\u2019t cut. When I do it though my grades go up, I focus and work better. \nMy emotions don\u2019t shut me down when I\u2019m cutting and I can almost completely ignore them. It feels nice and once or twice a day is all it takes. \nI also don\u2019t mind the scars, they make me feel like my pain is real. And even visually I don\u2019t mind them and I like the texture they have when they heal. \n\nI\u2019m still trying to stop because I know other people want me to but I\u2019m looking for some other reasons to stop I may be missing because I could use some more help and motivation. \n\nAnyone with any ideas or thoughts please comment or message me.

I grew up with three older siblings and it was fairly common for me to be abused by them in one form or another. Now my childhood wasn't always horrible but when it was. It was bad. I never got serious about wanting to die or self harm until I was in highschool. The most I had done before this was tell people I wanted to die. Or talk about ways I could die. I first cut when I was a sophomore and it kinda spiraled down since then. I started with a knife and it scared me how deep it cut. So I started using a key because I liked the pain. Then I started liking the blood and I used various instruments to cut. From a pencil sharpener to a blade from a razor. Then I started using knives and now I use super sharp razors. I also notice depending on my mood the cuts change. Some are neat deliberate cuts, too sporadic deep cuts. When I hate myself they are wild and normally cause alot of pain. When I'm sad about external things they are deliberate and shallow to allow for alot of blood. The most I used to cut was one to maybe five cuts at a time. I got better after highschool because I focused on finding different things to cope and improving myself and joining martial arts. Then my life started falling apart. I got broken up with. My hand got crushed at work and now I have a pin holding the tip of one of my fingers in place. Because of lost time at work I'm falling behind on bills and don't have enough money for food alot of the time. And slowly I cut more each time it happens. Today I cut 46 times and it feels completely normal. I never thought I would have the courage to kill myself. But lately I've actually meant it when I think about it. I'm not scared of it anymore. I actually want it and I think I have the courage to do it. And honestly that scares me so much. Im so afraid that I'm going to end my life. I know it doesn't sound right. How can I have the courage and want to kill myself but be afraid of it at the same time. I don't know. And that's what scares me. Before I never had the actual want or courage to do it. Idk what's changed. I know things In my life will get better. But I'm afraid I won't live through this rough patch. I'm just being stupid I know. But my feelings are my feelings. And idk what to do anymore. I know things will get better but I still want to die and cut. I hate my brain. I wish I had a way to make it stop without killing myself. Just end all my emotions and get through life like a robot. Then I would be happy. ", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

My parents have been married for about 20-some years and a few months ago just were divorced. The divorce was a relief but also made things worse. My parents spent an unhealthy amount of time in their relationship, and I was the only one home during their fights. They fought every night, slamming doors, breaking things, it all revolves around them being bipolar and them drinking. I hate people drinking around me and fighting in general. I moved out with my mom and my parents separated, I couldn\u2019t take my dog with me which absolutely sucked so I went back to my dads to see my dog. Later on, my parents got back together, it all happened again, fights, drinking, breaking things, it was awful. They finally separated again and got divorced, i\u2019ve been living with my mom now for over a year and still see my dad. But they each talk crap about the other parent. \n\nLike I said, I\u2019ve been dealing with depression for a long time now. Although, I\u2019ve gotten no medical help. My ex even pointed it out to me that I need help. I feel horrible for him because I personally didn\u2019t know how to help myself and I just realized how terrible I was to him. Anyway, I never wanted to talk to my mom about treatment, i\u2019m terrified. I became close to this one family and I rely on them, and they help me so much. I was talking to one of the parents about my situation and she immediately said If I wouldn\u2019t talk to my mom she would. So she did, but we didn\u2019t have insurance so my mom said once we get insurance we\u2019ll do something about it. \n\nWe got insurance at the beginning of March and nothing has happened. I still haven\u2019t gotten help. I finally built up the courage to talk to my mom and she said medication isn\u2019t the answer, I said, so what is? She said I can talk to someone, I told her I need to and she\u2019d look into it. Well, nothing has happened. I\u2019ve been cutting myself more constantly.

I was shaking, unable to do anything for \\~40 minutes until I finally took a shower. A day or two later we talked about it in person and he told me that even though it was hypocritical to say, he thinks that I probably shouldn't do it; he was really hands-off about it. That night it actually hit me\u2014*my friend cuts himself when he feels like there's no other answer.* I cried pretty hard that night.\n\nThen I texted him that I'd try hard not to cut. That worked for a few days. After a bit, I just stopped *wanting* to not cut.\n\nI spent spring break marking up my left hand. I've cut a few times since, but since school started back up I haven't had the energy to do it at nearly the frequency of that week.\n\nI haven't told him, and I don't know if I should. We drove in his car\u2014just drove, he does it to calm himself out\u2014on the Sunday of spring break. That probably would've been a good time to tell him, but I just didn't. Before I started cutting, I interacted with my friends with a lot of attention-seeking depression shit, and I think I might be over-correcting for that now. I also have no idea how to bring it up.\n\nHe might have caught on by now that I didn't stop, or he might not have. I don't know. He hasn't talked to me about it.\n\nShould I talk to him about it? If so, how? Should I try to help him? How?", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

But you will have to make your own decision if you want to walk that path or not.\n\nPeople, we must remember the alternative that is present in the minds of some of us. The alternative to SH. And let me be the first to say: I am glad I hurt myself. I am proud of the scars that line my shoulder and wrists. Because that shows one thing. That I am a goddamned survivor. \n\nStopping with SH is not the end goal. It is merely a mile stone. A sign that you are on the right path. \n\nToday I woke up, got a kiss from my girl and walked to my table, in my own goddamned house, eating pancakes for breakfast. That is the end goal.

Of course, this situation isn't easy to resolve. In the comments many people suggested that the OP leave this person because they were being manipulative and abusive to the OP. And while I agree that this person IS being kind of a jerk and that having a mental illness. doesn't excuse shitty behavior towards others, it made me think about how I treat people around me.\n\nCurrently, I only have one friend who knows about my selfharmig tendencies (I don't count my mom, since I don't really feel like talking to her about this, but she does know). We've talked about this when it was especially bad for me (spring-summer of 2018) and she was extremely supportive. The thing is, we only really talk on a Russian social media site, since she leaves in a different country. And sometimes I feel like I'm burdening her whenever I want to talk about my selfharm, like I'm selfish because of it. Recently when I started getting new urges out of the blue, I couldn't bring myself to talk to her, because she's just now graduated from school and I don't want to make her feel bad because of my problems.\nLast summer I would also reblog things on my personal page that were about selfharm in one way or another, so she sees it and, perhaps, asks me about this. Simetimes I also stop replying to her for a short amount of time (no more than a week) so she becomes worried about me (other times, however, I just don't feel like talking). Those never really worked anyway, haha. \nAlthough, I never was passive aggressive towards her and never dismissed her problems when she had some. \n\nNow I don't really now how to start a conversation about selfharm with her. On one hand, I know that I shouldn't hold everything in myself, because it'll lead to more problems, and she usually doesn't really mind it. But for some reason it feels manipulative when I talk about it. Feels like I'm trying to portray myself as a victim and it feels wrong, even if that's not the case. On the other hand, I don't want to disappoint her and I don't want to lose her because of my selfharm and other mental problems. Recently I told two girls in my study-group about selfharm and even described a specific event to them (of course, before that I asked them if they were okay with it). At first they reacted okay, but the next days they kinda started to talk less to me and even kinda ignore sometimes. I don't really care about that too much, I'm already used to be alone in a group, but I'm afraid that the same will happen with my online-friend. And I don't know how to adress it or if I even should adress it. I can't think of any way to talk about it without feeling like I'm manipulating her into feeling sorry for me.\n\nWell, I guess I don't really know what I'm trying to accomplish here. Some advice on how to recognise your OWN manipulative behaviour would be great (since every time I Google it I only get results for when YOU are being manipulated).\nThanks for reading this rant :D", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I've been clean since February 19th of this year, and I've only gotten worse since.

Without my biggest coping mechanism I haven't been able to go a single day without thinking about suicide. At this point I'm starting to think I cut to stop me from killing myself, and if that's really true, is it worth being clean? Hell, the only reason I've been clean as long as I have been is because I don't want to let down my friend who's been there for me through all of this, but now I don't know if I'm just bottling everything up until it explodes, because I don't have an effective outlet anymore.

I don't know for sure that that's what I heard, but I plan on asking her later. We didn't get that far when I approached her after and we started talking. She brought up my \"past\" self harm and how she doesn't understand why my mom got angry and punished me for it. We talked a bit more and I was figuring out how to ask her if I heard what I thought I did, when I realized my mom was home. I didn't hear her come in, so I worry she overheard some of this talk, but she isn't acting weird as far as I can tell so I hope she didn't. I had stuff to do and couldn't talk more anyway, but later when my mom is downstairs I'm going to try and talk with my sister some more. I dont want her to be without support, and I know she doesn't tell my mom anything like this because she's afraid she will react badly. I'm pretty sure (but not positive) shes tried cutting before, so I want to try and figure that out and see if it's an issue. \n\nI am a little unsure of how to handle this depending on what she tells me. I know my mom would want me to tell her if my sister was/is thinking about or doing these things, but my sister and I are extremely similar and my mom is likely to treat her like she did me, which was bordering on abusive at some points and I don't want that for her at all. But I worry about whether that's actually the right decision, and also for my own ability to help her when I'm in such a bad mental state myself. I'm the older sister, I'm the adult, so I should act accordingly, but I'm worried that I'll handle it poorly and possibly make her feel worse. I'm going to try my best though, because I want to do everything I can to prevent her from going through what I have. ", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I still wanted it, but it was relatively easy to quit. after stopping for around 3 weeks, I started again. and i've never had an overwhelming urge to cut. heck, sometimes I forget! while it can absolutely be addictive and damaging process for some people, this has not been the case for me. it is unlike a drug where even if the thing causing the reason for drug abuse goes away, people return to the drug when they'd otherwise be fine. if you cure the underlying issue, (anxiety, depression, etc.) people will stop using this coping mechanism. people will self harm when they need to, and stop when they don't anymore.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

And what differentiates the two isn\u2019t about the cut itself, but everything that had led up to that moment: the \u2018why\u2019 I guess. \n\nThe long cut is a sad cut. It\u2019s the one I\u2019ve waited for all day, imagined in slow motion on repeat, fantasized about in my daydreams as I say to myself \u2018It will be okay, just a few more hours and then...\u2019 The long cut is like a hot bath, a soft nap in my own bed: something to come home to, something stable and reliable - a break from a painfully overwhelming life during which I can barely rely on myself to remember how to breathe. The long cut is a reward of sorts, like a pat on the back for making it this far as I let myself sink into the arms of intense pain after a slow day of dull, unbearable suffering.\n\nThe fast cut is an angry cut. I\u2019m sad, maybe ? Jealous ? Numb ? It doesn\u2019t matter. In that moment, I am angry. Perhaps I am angry because I am numb - the blankness of my mind when I know I should be brimming with joy, sadness. It doesn\u2019t matter. The blankness is suffocating. Immediate relief. The fast cut is an inhaler, an EpiPen. I can\u2019t breathe - or maybe I can, but too fast, to short. I find a vacant stall in the school bathroom. I wait as the girls next to me finish talking about their cheating boyfriends and leave. Or I\u2019m at a friend\u2019s house and their mom just offered me dinner. Or maybe someone I love has died. \nIt doesn\u2019t matter. The feelings are the same; the overwhelming need to breathe again. \nFeel again.\n\nI tried to focus this post on more on the emotional weight of self harm. I used to cut a few years ago and have recently relapsed but part of what I\u2019m doing differently this time is trying to explore how I feel and why I cut. Please respond with your thoughts, I\u2019d love to better understand other\u2019s experiences. \n\n...\n\nEdit : Holy shit this got so much bigger than I ever expected!! I'd debated posting this yesterday for hours and hours but you guys are all wonderful I'm so happy I did :) Thank you so much for responding and sharing your own experiences and emotions, I\u2019m so honored to be able to read them all &lt;3 Please be safe everyone, you are all so worth it.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I WISH my teacher would just tell me that she won\u2019t accept this big assignment late so I could get kicked out of this stupid fucking program that I never wanted to be a part of in the first place, and so my mom can\u2019t guilt me into staying in it. But it doesn\u2019t matter anyways because either way I\u2019m going to feel like a dumbass idiot and a failure because that\u2019s what I am!! \n\nand I wish every person in my life didn\u2019t have to look and talk to me as if I need TELLING that I\u2019m taking too long on catching up, and that I should work harder or that I am a disappointment or just causing other people stress! Cause like I can tell you I already know that!!! i don\u2019t need a reminder! \n\nI think it\u2019s even funnier how my mom told me that I \u201cneed to get sleep\u201d because I stayed up last night working on it and got 2 hours of sleep, and mentioned I was gonna stay up again for it- but she also told me that I shouldn\u2019t turn it incomplete and that I should \u201cactually try\u201d, and that she pretends to care about my sleep so much even though I haven\u2019t seen my therapist in a long time and it took me 5+ years to even get someone to prescribe me with sleep medication but i can\u2019t take it bc i have to stay up to work on shit. and she just?? pretends like the problems aren\u2019t there but acts so surprised when I tell her I am staying up late, and acts so confused when I get upset when she says dumb shit to me or when she keeps talking to me when I am clearly upset, acts so fucking surprised when i am on the breaking point and burnt out constantly like I have been this entire month\n\nand none of my teachers fucking give a god damn shit. They can pretend to, and you can say \u201coh but they care!!\u201d all you want but all of them know I was in the hospital last month because I tried to kill myself and only ONE teacher has been understanding and worked with me to get caught up on the most important things, like the fucking academy coordinator, my guidance counselor, my therapist at the hospital, and my mom told them. only one teacher has given me options on catching up during class, and telling me what the important things she feels are. only fucking one. \n\nThe rest of my teachers maybe checked up on me once before handing me all of the makeup work I have to do, (again against what they were told to do! By their boss!) and then ignoring it and not talking to me at all when I am falling behind and obviously struggling. \n\nsome even go as far as to push me too hard to keep caught up while catching up on makeup work and doing multiple MAJOR assignments (which are supposed to be the only thing I focused on), and asking me all expectantly when I will finish their work (like in That Tone where they\u2019re really just scolding you and pinning the blame on you for falling behind), and making snarky comments when I communicate with them openly about what\u2019s going on and tell them my honest answer which is that I don\u2019t think I can get caught up that fast. \n\nLike I\u2019m so fucking sorry miss I can\u2019t make up the oral presentation, that I missed all of the in class practice for that everyone else got, I was too busy working on More Important and due sooner things and trying not to hurt myself or find a way to kill myself again!! but this big assignment is due tomorrow and I haven\u2019t gotten a decent amount of sleep in about two weeks and I am unsure I will be able to finish it . Guess it doesn\u2019t matter tho bc either way I\u2019m going to be exhausted and the worlds biggest fucking failure!!!", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I will be adding a little humor in this post but don't inertpert that as making light of the seriousness of the topic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday I cut deep again. I normally can control the bleeding and patch my self up pretty good. That was not this case this time. It happened and work I have a very secluded office so you have to want to find me. We have a clinic at work that deals with work place injuries, not strictly so it is close to my office and free. They saw how soaked my make shift bandage was and actually kicked someone out of a room to look at my arm. It took them about 30 seconds to tell me I needed to go to the ER/Urgent Care. Urgent Care told me to go to the ER (they are side by side so it was basically checking into the ER.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe ER said it was going to be a wait unless I wanted to go into a cardiac room. I told them I would wait, thinking in my mind was that that if someone is having a heart attack they deserved the room more than some asshole who directly and intentionally harmed him self. I fell asleep while waiting with my elbow resting on my leg. They called my name and I didn't answer because I fell asleep. They have my picture on file and saw my injury so they knew who I was. I stood up and immediately face planted. I tired to get up and face planted again. They had the security guard and 2 nurses put me back in my seat. They were busy and didn't have an wheel chairs available so they used an office chair. They to me in the room and was severely worried about my ability to stand. I just told them it was numb from sleeping and i was good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the room they stopped the bleeding then had like 3 different social workers come talk to me, apparently i had gotten a room right when they were doing shift changes. It was all the same ole BS, are you suicidal? do you have a plan? etc. Thy also asked me why i cut my left are, I told them it was because i was right handed, not the answer they were looking for. My wife was unable to come into the room because she had my young daughter with her and they didn't allow small children in the rooms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally they come into to clean the wound and were surprised at how deep it was, i had actually cut muscle. I ended up with 3 internal stitches and 8 external ones. My arm hurts like hell. I had to stay the night in the hospital as a 'safety' measure.

The slashes remind me of the arguments my parents have and school stress. Just seeing them makes me relieved I vented about them because actually speaking/thinking about these problems makes me cry a lot (which is a pain I do not like due to my throat feeling like it is being squeezed). I cannot go to my parents about these problems because they're part of the reason why they exist (and are wanting me to forget about them and go on with academics, thus doubling the emotional pain from their pressure).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs doing this OK at all?

{"post_id": "b6t6so", "created_utc": 1553835635, "title": "[TW rant] how I feel about my relapses", "author": "eliasynne", "self_text": "I've been SHing since I was about eleven years old. In the beginning the reason had to do with the comfort and also a lot of me just really wanted someone to give a shit, as many people do.\n\nWhen I was sixteen my mother degraded me for having scars. She told me I'd \"better heal those fast\" because I'll never get a job like that. I felt awful.\n\nWhen I was seventeen I was in a very toxic relationship with a boy who straight up told me he was disappointed in me for relapsing for the first time in a year. He cared more about the prospect of me cheating on him than whether I was okay or not.\n\nNow, the time I spend clean between relapses is growing, and I'm proud of myself. Since that relationship, I've always beat myself up for ever even thinking of hurting myself; I felt like a coward, a disappointment. And rather than recovering because I felt it was for the better good, I stayed clean because I hated feeling like a disappointment.\n\nAs I've gotten older though, I've come to understand some things, such as self harm is an addiction, similar to smoking or drinking. You can't just expect someone to stop smoking after so many years; I shouldn't expect myself to be able to quit cold turkey after so many years. And if I relapse? It'll be okay! I can pull myself out of it. I've done it before and I'll do it again. What started as a coping mechanism and a little bit of teenage angst stemming from needing attention turned into an addiction I couldn't help, and I can recognize that there's more to it than just deciding to stop, and since then, I've had a much better view on my relapses. I'm far less inclined to beat myself up for it because it is what it is. What's important is that, as I say, the time I spend clean between relapses is getting longer and longer--it's all going to stop eventually. I shouldn't torture myself for not being able to make it stop cold, instead, I should take care of myself in the moment and look forward to the growth I'll have coming out of it.\n\nSo my mindset towards this has been strong. I relapsed the other day and rather than feeling awful I just took a deep breath and accepted the fact that yes, it happened, but that In NO way invalidates all my progress so far! A set back isn't a reset button. It will be okay.\n\n\nIt happened again recently though, and it was worse than I intended it to be, and all that guilt and shame is coming back to me. I feel so awful. I'm trying to remember to be positive about this but it's hard when I know that, even though I'll make it out of this alive and well as always, I'll still have the scars to show how little self control and self discipline I have. How weak minded I am.\n\nPositivity and negativity are having their battles right now. I'm sorry to rant, it's just I have nobody to talk to in person because I don't want to drag anyone into an uncomfortable situation they don't want to be in. I just kinda want someone to understand, I suppose. Thank you \ud83d\udc95", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

We had to read a text we've never seen before, read a poem from memory and pronounce some phrases. Not much, really.

I'm always stupid and it doesn't matter how hard I try because I'll still fail. I run away from my groupmates and hid in the restroom. I don't have a knife with me, so I tried my keychain, but it didn't do much. I did however managed to use my nails to make little cuts.\nThen I went away to a different floor to try to calm down and draw something. Here, where I am sitting right now, a teacher from a different faculty is having a conversation about cinematograph and critique of films with a student. Their voices are so calm and respectful, they do not raise their voices. For some reason, it made me calm down. I've been listening to their talk for a while now, and I haven't even thought about some things they've discussed. \n\nI don't know why I'm writing this here.

Let's just say no one was getting hurt an no one was getting deprived of their possession as I don't believe violence against other people or theft is a good thing.

I used to use a 1-year-old box cutter, but I decided I should buy a new knife that would be only for cutting to minimize the risk of infection.

When I finally tried cutting with the new knife I cut way deeper than I had ever cut before because I didn't think about how the new knife was sharper and wouldn't need the same amount of force.  I had accidentally made my first styro cut and honestly it scared the shit out of me.  It scared me into telling my therapist about my self harm, who gave me strategies to prevent self harm.  But instead of doing the smart thing and using the fear I had about cutting with the new knife in addition to the strategies they gave me to start a clean streak, I instead made baby cuts with the new knife to get used to it.  I no longer fear cutting too deep with the new knife.

Sometimes she can be understanding, but if you really irritate her she's very intolerant and lacks understanding of any other perspective besides her own.

As they accumulate, I just feel worse. \n\nEvery time she gets on me for something like picking at my face, the things she says about it (and me) make me realize that if she ever knew I was cutting, she would feel the same way but even more strongly, and I don't think I can handle being that immature and disgusting and worthless to her. I just think about her finding out and I have so much fear about it and disgust for myself, because I know what she would say. It's the same thing she's said for years, but every time she has less patience with me so I know it would be worse than anything past. I feel like a failure and would honestly rather kill myself than have these feelings get worse. She doesn't understand, she never will, and I will never be able to escape her criticism. \n\nEdit: okay so I was literally crying and punching myself and suicidal for like an hour, and then once I got it all out of my system I felt way better.

I had been planning to cut for hours, and that desire suddenly went away, I made like one superficial cut for the hell of it and left it at that.

He doesn't speak fluent English and neither do his friends but they've said stuff like that he looks at me a lot and is really shy. I tried to write him a note that said I liked him but I don't know if he could read it or like understand it. Also, I'm a literal dumbass, but he keeps sending the little heart things on insta to me but idk if it's meant to be friendly or not. I'm sorry for being such a dumbass. He always smiles at me when I see him and he held my hand breifly, but I'm stupid so it probably meant nothing bc I barely have any experience with this kind of thing.

Said he'd been trying to work up the courage to ask for a while now. He was younger than me, but also, a history of cutting too. He told me about some of it, including his cutting on his *head*, so as to let his hair cover it. He also told me how he had tried to commit suicide with a (fake he now well suspects) cyanide pill from the darkwebs, and the conversation went to our histories of drug use and abuse (my previous meth addiction was supplied entirely through online purchasing). Finally, C) after showering, a much older gentleman (70's maybe?) also commented, and the direction of his questions brought about me mentioning that I have a bipolar diagnosis (vs. just a depression one which tends to be people's default). Turns out he does as well. Comes from a family in which is runs rampant, and he'd had it diagnosed decades back.

Please", "author": "rando320", "self_text": "WARNING: I know this is on a self harming community, but I may say some things that could trigger some people. This post is to ask for advice regarding my friend who\u2019s long-time depressed and newly cutting. \nIt\u2019s also to understand motives behind it, as I\u2019m trying to understand her. \n\nOur friendship circle is a group of small unpopular teens with a shared love for a stupid boy band and we work as a support group for eachother, I guess.\n\nOne friend who is so fucking dear to me, has confessed to us that during the Christmas holidays, she began cutting. \nFirst, we showed our support, continued being good friends, took her out, distracted her from her shitty family situations and things were as good as things could be.\n\nBut recently, I\u2019m talking in the course of a week, she\u2019s scattered her body with cuts and shapes. Wolves and hearts. \n\nIve read up as much as possible about how to support a friend who self harms, however, some of the friends in our circle who I\u2019m not as close with, I haven\u2019t shared thoughts with. \nOne of them basically encourages the cutting, admires the \u201cart\u201d, and literally said to our friend today (who we took out to DISTRACT from this stuff) \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing more\u201d. \nThe person who said this isn\u2019t self harming or even considering self harming (according to the ones who are close with her) but she\u2019s interested in body art, and relates the cutting to body art (henna, tattoos etc.). I really don\u2019t think encouraging things is any good at all.\n\nHowever, today the friend who is self harming tried to explain to us who were very worried and hurt about it that it\u2019s like an endless cycle.. she said that she hurts, and so she cuts. Her cutting hurts us, and she sees it hurts us and so it hurts her more and so she cuts more. She asked for us to \u201cget used to the cuts\u201d. What am I supposed to do? Ignore it?\n\nThis is so twisted and idk how to handle things. I don\u2019t want to show her I\u2019m hurt by it (for the reasons she stated, I don\u2019t want her to feel guilty) but I don\u2019t want to ignore it. And it\u2019s kinda hard because she now cuts in places that are extremely obvious. It\u2019s impossible for her to hide t under her school uniform.. \n\nSomeone said it could be for attention seen as she\u2019s showing them off and stuff (only to close friends, however. I feel as though she wants us to care as her family doesn\u2019t give a shit). \nShe previously asked me in class if I wanted to touch it. She then admitted to me she was trying to weird me out and so I ignored her whenever she brought it up, only for her to return with more cuts. Many of us ignored her for the same reason. But I believe ignoring her was the wrong thing to do.\n\nIf any questions need to be asked about her in order for better advice, I\u2019ll gladly answer. \nI\u2019m all ears for anything and everything. I feel like I need advice from people who are experienced and outside of this specific situation.. so please, yeah.. \nI just want to do what\u2019s best for her cause I care so much about her.

As a self-harmer as well, I felt that my friend had to be right. I felt as if, with every step this girl took and with every concerned look or eye-roll she received, and with every time I heard her declare \u2018oh this ? AHAHA it\u2019s not that bad, it could be so much worse!!!\u2019 she was belittling my own experiences by almost bragging about her fresh scars.\n\nShe was cutting for attention. At least I had a genuine reason.\n\nA couple months went by and nothing changed. The girl on my swim team continued slowly adding to her collection of half-inch long shallow cuts on her legs, and people continued to ridicule her for it behind her back. No one had really liked her before this incidence, so it did nothing positive for her social life. I couldn\u2019t help but feel angry towards her and everyone else who \u2018cut for attention.\u2019 Those who talked openly and uninvited about their scars and seemed to feed off the shock value and the pseudo-concern it generated from others. I felt that she had no right to cut. It made the rest of us look bad.\n\nI ended up going home one day and telling my mom about the girl on my swim team and how I felt about her, ranting about the invalidity of her self-harm in comparison to mine. What she said in response was one of the wisest things anyone has ever said to me.\n\n\u201cIf she cuts herself, her reason for doing it is no less as valid as yours simply because you cannot relate to it.\u201d I was honestly taken aback. I let her elaborate further and that day my mindset towards the girl on my swim team, and the phrase in the title of this post, flipped upside down. I began to question why it is an inherently bad thing if someone does, in fact, cut for attention. Cutting is not like dyeing your hair or showing off your new car. Cutting - and self-harm in general - is a coping mechanism for inner struggle. And, accompanying this, it\u2019s human nature to crave love and attention and form social bonds with those around us. How could I assume she was receiving enough love from her family or from her friends at school ? How could I assume she felt as if she belonged in this world ? How could I assume she was psychologically okay and was simply faking the aesthetic of self-harm ? The fact that this girl would go to such lengths for attention and physically harm herself - regardless of the size or depth of her cuts - meant that maybe, just maybe, she actually needed that attention.\n\nI began talking to her gradually - getting breakfast with her after morning practices on Saturdays and texting her throughout the week. She opened up to me pretty fast. He relationship with her father was on the verge of collapsing and she had recently been shunned from her classmates for reasons she still could not understand. As the two of us became closer, she began to cut less.\n\nI felt ashamed of how I had approached her struggles in the past and how I had done nothing to question what those around me said about her. To anyone who has read this far, please understand that self-harming \u2018for attention\u2019 *is* a valid reason. As humans, many of us can\u2019t cope healthily with loneliness. To joke and mock depression and/or anxiety when one is not diagnosed is not okay to me. But to brag about cutting, and literal self-inflicted harm, is something that needs to be taken as seriously as those who cut in private. We need to help each other out, guys. Please don\u2019t leave a fellow self-harmer in the dark just because their approach is different to yours.\n\nAnd by the way, 3 years later, she and I are now very close friends :)", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I just needed to vent about it. \n\nSo, I\u2019ve been self harming for about a year and a half now. I\u2019ve been through a lot of shit with people seeing scars/fresh cuts/etc. When I first came back to school after having just started cutting, I dealt with a lot with people seeing my cutting, as it was just starting up. I was in a gym class during the first semester and the girls in my line of lockers were constantly humiliating me. I\u2019d turn around to change and they\u2019d forcibly turn me around and make fun of my fresh cuts and they\u2019d act super disgusted when they got worse. I\u2019d try to walk away to change in the showers and they\u2019d just grab me and force me to change in front of them. I was terrified. I even had a girl start yelling at me and threatening to fight me because I was \u2018cutting for attention.\u2019 It was awful. I had a boy in my math class move my dress up off my thigh and yell at me for cutting. I was so terrified. Once the second semester of that year started, I slowly started to get over it. I stopped wearing the dresses and skirts and whatnot but one day, during the last month of school and one of the hottest days of the spring, I wore shorts. I put large bandaids over my scars to hide them and I thought \u201cthat\u2019s that\u201d and got on with it. During second period, a group of students noticed and made fun of my scars and made jokes about me killing myself to the point where I stormed out of class and collapsed in the hall crying, memories of the first semester flooding back to me. But thankfully, I cleaned myself up and near the time that school was about to start, I got the courage to wear a bikini to a public manmade lake sort of thing and nobody looked at me any differently. I was at a diving board and I saw a few people look but all they did was smile at me a bit brighter. Either that, or they didn\u2019t look and just noticed how fucking blasted I was the entire time. Either way, it was empowering. I wore shorts to a family event with a leg warmer over my scars and eventually got the drunken courage to just take it off. It felt really good to just walk freely and none of my relatives looked at me much differently, I don\u2019t think. \n\nWell, first semester of this school year, I had two gym classes back to back. I had to make up the one from last year because eventually I stopped changing altogether and stopped coming to the locker room. I failed it and had to retake it. So, I kept my locker right by the showers. I\u2019d learned my lesson. But I found myself to be changing right by my locker, as my friends who\u2019d seen my scars during the gym class by mistake were all very encouraging to me and supported me in my struggle to hide them. That was in my gym class with students from my grade. I had people in that line of lockers with me who I wasn\u2019t close with but they never looked for longer than a second at a time. In my gym class that I had to make up, I was told by an acquaintance toward the end of the semester that people were too scared of me to say anything to me in that class period. Which was fine. It was better than last year. \n\nThis semester has been quite interesting. Through January and February, nobody has said anything to me about any of it. But in March, things have started to kick up again. I was messing around during health class (basically a required blow off class for everyone) with an acquaintance of mine. We were jokingly doing palm reading and I have some very faint scars on my left arm. I wasn\u2019t slitting my wrists, actually. Just cutting on the opposite side of my arm, looking for firm skin. The scars are faded since I didn\u2019t self harm brutally like I do on my right thigh. Well, he jokingly grabbed my left arm and pretended to read my scars. I immediately froze and felt myself go completely numb. It was the same feeling I did to protect myself during traumatizing situations. I did it when I was being sexually abused by an ex girlfriend, etc. I pretended like I didn\u2019t care and just took my arm away and found an excuse to go back to my desk. I\u2019m not religious, but I literally sat there and prayed to whatever divine being that may or may not exist that this would never happen again. I was heavily mistaken. \n\nA few more occurrences have happened since then. All of them have happened in the same God-forsaken class. Choir. One day, I wore this pair of jeans of mine that have a rectangular-shaped hole in the left thigh. As of recently, I\u2019ve been cutting there, as I\u2019ve grown tired of cutting over scar tissue repeatedly on my other thigh. I\u2019d had a bandaid over the scars and I had a friend point to it and ask what it was. I shrugged it off and my friend next to me whispered in my ear to just ignore it and that it would hit her the next day. That friend, let\u2019s call her Lauren, knows that I\u2019m a self harmer. I\u2019m in a band with her and we talk a lot about our issues with one another. She\u2019s a constant in the next few situations. \n\nAn occurrence that happened after that, was when I was wearing these rolled up mom jeans. I had them rolled up about three times, but when I crossed my legs, they rode up. Well, one day, I had my left leg over my right leg and they rode up. I have a patch of scars on my calf and I guess it rode up quite a bit. I had a friend who typically is quite cold to all emotion put his hand on my foot and tell me that he loves me, which he never does. I quickly looked down at my calf and pulled the pant down and crossed my legs in a different position. Lauren put her hand on my shoulder and just rubbed it for a for a few before releasing it. Immediately calmed me down. \n\nAnother situation that happened just a day after that, was when the same girl who asked about the bandaid, made this joke saying, \u201cScars in!\u201d and put her arm in the middle. Without hesitation, as I love dark humor, I put my arm in with the scars and she started apologizing to me repeatedly and I just laughed. She texted me later that day and told me that she was there for me if I needed it. I told her that I\u2019d be okay but that I appreciated her offer. I released not long after. \n\nWell, what this entire post has been leading to, was what happened yesterday (the day before spring break)  in my choir class. I wore those same jeans but without the bandaid over my scars. It was nice. I\u2019d genuinely thought I\u2019d gotten to a point of not giving a fuck anymore.  I was gravely mistaken. \n\nThis girl, who\u2019s in my health class and my choir class, I don\u2019t get along with well. We\u2019re okay and all, but she\u2019s an asshole to me. I just blow it off but yesterday, she crossed the line. I was sitting with Lauren and some other friends doing absolutely nothing aside talking and she points to my thigh and goes, \u201cWhat are those scratches on your  leg?\u201d Nobody else really heard so I blew it off, but knowing what to think and not having the patience to overthink it. \n\nMore time goes on during class and my friend Lauren and I go up to the microphone to sing Dinosaur Train as a joke so we wouldn\u2019t have to singe our required songs. This same girl says the same thing. Everyone goes fucking silent. The girl next to her slaps her arm and one of the most academically-focused girls in the class goes, \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d I simply grab my books and my purse and walk out of class, as I just couldn\u2019t think of anything else to do. When I walk out, I hear people start to tell her how badly she fucked up. My choir teacher asks her if she cursed at me and I told her that she didn\u2019t. The teacher proceeded to say that she\u2019s only be able to write her up if she\u2019d cursed at me, to which, I just nodded numbly. The girl walked out of class with a bathroom pass and sat next to me and started apologizing, saying that she had no idea and started asking me about why I was doing it, if I\u2019d been treated, etc. I told her, as this as the only time she\u2019d ever been genuine with me. I\u2019d heard her mention to someone in class that she\u2019d been going to therapy 4 times a week and I asked her about it. For the next 15 minutes, we both opened up about our problems and she ended up asking me to hang out with her at some point. \n\nThere isn\u2019t much of a moral to these stories, more or less I just hope someone reading this is able to draw connections to their own stories.

I don't see a clear outline where the butterfly bandage was underneath it though, so I'm unsure if I had a reaction to the butterfly or not. \n\nI have two questions. 1. If I had a reaction this time, will I continue to have reactions to them? Will they get worse? And 2. The area around the cut in my wrist (where the non-sticky part was) isnt red, but the cut itself is and looks like it could be starting to get infected. Is this because of the reaction, and is it still concerning if it is? \n\nAny answers and advice would be appreciated. \n\nEdit: okay so it's been almost two full days since I took off the bandaid. When I've gotten the chance I wash my entire wrist in soap and water and put neosporin on the cut itself with no bandaid, because I am worried about infection. The first 24 hrs i didnt notice much of a difference, but last night I washed my wrist and put neosporin on all of it, in case it helped the rash. I woke up this morning and the cut and rash are way better now! Not sure if it's coincidence or if it really helped the rash, but I'm glad it's getting better. ", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

(this will be relevant to this sub towards the middle/end.)\n\nreason 1: People made a big deal out of me not eating a damned donut. Ok so for context, I\u2019ve been fasting/eating very little and working out a lot in order to lose weight. One of the people that made a big deal out of me not eating the damned donut told another classmate about my whole fasting thing. The classmate that got told, we\u2019ll call her K, will come in this rant again later...\n\nReason 2: One of my friends(?), we\u2019ll just call her A, told me something about two of my friends that I stupidly believed. It ruined my day for a good 3 hours until she told me that I \u201cmisunderstood\u201d her. So I had told A in the past that someone, we\u2019ll call them B, had feelings for another friend of mine. So A brought it back up, but said that B had told her themselves that they had feelings for this person. Then later that day I told A that what she had said put me in a bad mood, and that\u2019s when A said I had \u201cmisunderstood\u201d her and that she was talking about what I had told her in the past.\n\nReason 3: So when I was feeling really upset after A had told me about B (before she told me I \u201cmisunderstood\u201d her) I was ignoring everybody in class. I\u2019m actually surprised the teacher didn\u2019t think I was sleeping because I was laying my head face down pretty much all that hour. Anyway, everything was getting to me and I had the urge to cut really bad, so I started slashing at my wrist with my pencil. (Everyone was talking to each other and the teacher was on her computer, so no one was paying attention to me. I also made sure to be pretty secretive about it whilst I was doing it.) So next hour comes along, and we had to watch this video all that hour. K (I told you she\u2019d come in later.) then asked me what had happened to my wrist. I had a massive panic attack and mumbled something. She didn\u2019t hear me, so the best thing I could come up with was \u201cOh, I must\u2019ve just scratched it on something, I don\u2019t know,\u201d and just turned back to the video we were watching. I could tell she wasn\u2019t buying it, so now this K girl is skeptical of me AND she knows about me starving myself.\n\nReason 4 (huge and last part of my rant): That part of the night prior to the best part of my night is kind of a blur for me, so I\u2019ll just get to the spicy part. Ok so about 20 minutes before 10, I was having huge urges to cut because of my fun rollercoaster of a day. I played some good sad boi songs and took my case off to discover: my razor gone! Now I didn\u2019t remember putting it back in my case that morning cause I kept it out the night before, so I thought maybe it was on the floor or on my bed. So I checked and as I guessed, it wasn\u2019t there. The first time a razor of mine has disappeared, it had \u201cfallen out\u201d (now that I think about it, I\u2019m pretty sure my friend had taken it out of my case the first time too.) so I thought maybe it had fallen out again. So I asked my friend if she had anything to do with the disappearance of my razor. She didn\u2019t give me a straight answer, so I just assumed it was a yes. She proceeded to tell me that she had taken it out after I told her I was upset and stormed off to class. What she didn\u2019t tell me was that my fucking boyfriend of all people ended up with it. I thought maybe she had thrown it away like she did the last time, but no. I have a stash of razors, so I just grabbed another one and started going ham on my thighs. Next thing I know, my boyfriend texts me, and without any warning, asks me if he can see my cuts. I told him I would in a bit since I literally just started cutting when he texted me, but he said he didn\u2019t care and that he wanted to see them that second. So I sent him a picture of one of my thighs and then my ankle since he asked to see that as well. He then started blaming himself on it and saying that he couldn\u2019t take it anymore. At this point, I start full on crying thinking that he was going to break up with me. Then we had a not so fun conversation on the phone for a little bit. He said if my cutting didn\u2019t get any better, he was going to force me to talk to my parents about it which is something I do NOT want to do whatsoever.

In some ways, it bothered me that my aunt knew I was cutting again, but did not say anything -- especially since as I said, I moved on from pricking myself (which is relatively harmless in comparison) to cutting myself. So, I introduced the topic in our conversation by telling her that the scars on my arm were not from that. I made up some outrageous lie that we both knew wasn't true, but seeing how intent she was to disprove my lie felt... kinda nice. However, understandably, she was upset with the lie because she feels like I am sending \"mixed signals\" in the sense that given how she has said some things in the past that have hurt me, she does not want to \"intrude\" or say anything else that would hurt me. And, in her words, she is here if I want to talk about it, but she also understands if I don't want to talk about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem is -- I DO want to talk about it. I just... like, I want her to pry. I want her to be concerned, I guess. It is concerning to ME that I am cutting because of my hesitation for doing it. Most of the people in my life are... either negligent or just in that same boat of not wanting to... intrude, which is great, I guess, but also not... But, now, I have this person, my aunt, that I do want to talk to about this, but it's not like I can tell her to pry, ask me questions, etc. Especially since I don't know if SHE wants to talk about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow do I tell her that I DO want her to ask questions? I want to stop. In fact, when we were briefly talking about it, she told me she wanted me to stop, and that is the first time someone has told me to. Like, on one end, I understand people not wanting to talk about it and respecting my boundaries, but I'm not not talking about it because I don't want to, it's just I don't know how to approach it. What to even say? But, I guess it's also my own selfishness for thinking that she would want to talk about it or that she even has questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess it also doesn't help that my aunt is part of the reason I started cutting in the first place, but that's too long of a story to share.

No one knows I'm very good at faking my happiness. No one really knows about my depression or my cutting but I already know when and how I will kill my self but I know I won't do it till my mom had passed just couldn't hurt her like that. Once she has passed I have decided it would be easier to just get it over with. Till then though I cut to try and release some of the pressure and pain that is in my head and it helps I've never wanted to tell anyone because I dont want to be placed into a metal hospital and really dont  think I need to be. If  I wanted to kill my self right now  I could do it any day.  I work in construction most of the time I'm over 100ft in the air and could easily do it but like I said before I have no intention on doing it till after my mom has passed. If your gonna say some bs about it being for attention your a idiot so save your breath it's been 3 years and no one has ever seen one of my 300 scares attention has nothing to do with it\n\nIf i had a question in that random rant it would be should I talk to a therapist? I always lie to my family doctor about my depression cuz they just give me pill after pill that doesn't help. Will they try and commit me if I'm honest about my plans and feelings and is this a normal way to feel? Does it actually go away or will I be like this for ever", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I'm on holiday right now with my friends and I'm having a breakdown. I want to go home so badly but I still have two days left of this shit. I woke up at 5 am. The day before I woke up at 8 and the day before that I woke up at 6. This would be fine if I was able to fall asleep before 1/2 am. I've never been a good sleeper. I don't know what people mean when they say \"shut your brain off\". That doesn't happen for me. It's like I'm on high alert everyday. I would be brilliant for looking out for tigers back in the day. Shame our stress is now localised on capitalism. So it severely doesn't help that both people are snoring. I think I'm about to have a meltdown. \n\nI've started hitting myself. I can give myself some pretty gnarly bumps on my head. I can't describe how I feel before hand. Kind of like a pressure cooker I suppose. People have always said \"try distracting yourself\" or \"do something you enjoy\". I wish my brain worked like that. I don't want to by neurotypical. I want the people who are supposed to help me to do their fucking job. I'm in a dispute right now with my last psychiatrist. He kicked me and my family out of his room the third time I saw him. It would be very hard to believe that I honestly did nothing wrong but I don't need anyone to. I know it, my family knows it and soon every resolution option will know it. I'm probably going to go to the Ombudsmen after they ignore the second letter I sent to them. Or they will send another back trying to blame me again. I honestly don't know how I'm getting through this. Imagine thinking that you are a horrible person your whole life then having the person that's supposed to help you tell you \"yeah pretty much\". I'm not surprised though. All the psychiatrists I've met have an authoritarian complex. \n\nFuck, if you don't get any help with autism when you are younger you may as well give up. There's nothing out there for a 24 year old who struggles with basically everything. I think they get confused though. I'm not babbling on the ground and can use full sentences so their ability to just drop me off in a psych centre is hampered. I used to think maybe going there would actually help but no. It didn't work. \n\nI'm going to beg to get my own room in the morning. I desperately need some time alone. I'm not getting it. I'm going to go find some knives in a bit.

Fucking. Hard. To be best friends with, but it was extremely one sided. She will only ever talk to me if there's nobody else to talk to. She never asks how I'm doing and mocks the things that I like.\n\nBut more recently, way more recently, I've made friends with two girls. They seem to be the ones I've been looking for my entire life. And I know this because one of them had said that we should wear shorts on Monday. I told her that I couldn't wear shorts at the moment and the following interaction takes place;\n\n\"Oh, I know why.\"\n\n\"You-you do? Wh-wha-what do y-you mean?\" I stutter and laugh nervously when I'm nervous.\n\n\"I saw on Friday.\" I wore a risky skirt on Friday.\n\n\"What-what are you talk-talking about?\" More nervous laughing\n\n\"You know what I'm talking about.\" She pulls down her pant leg and shows me her own scars. They're a lot smaller compared to mine, and so I got a little bit more nervous about what she'd think of mine.\n\nShe asked me to show her and I did. She said,\"Oh honey\" and then gave me advice on how to heal them up and stuff. She even gave me a cream and said that I could talk to her when I got down.\n\nThe other friend was in the bathroom during this, but she knew already because I told her.\n\nThey weren't put off by it. The one that gave me the cream even asked me to stay the night. I didn't because I'm not comfortable spending the night in different places. The last time I've been invited to stay the night was a sixth grade birthday party.\n\nThis interaction makes me realize that I don't think I've ever really had true friends until now. And it makes quitting self harm seem a lot easier. I used to do it when I was lonely, but I have a feeling that I won't be feeling that as much anymore. At least I hope.\n\nTLDR; After a lifetime of shitty friends, I might finally have some that care for me, and it might make quitting SH a lot easier.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

When I was 5, I had cancer and I had to take tablets everyday till evening. After that, when I was 11, I had an illness called GBS. It's basically... I'm not sure but basically your nervous system fucks up and it sends wrong signals to your brain. For example, for me, if I touched water, it would hurt, my brain lost oll of its memory of writing and walking. I literally had to learn how to walk and write again. So now, I'm here.. I'm 14 and I'm alive. When I was 13, I did my first cutting. Wanna guess what I did it with? A random fucking sharp spring I found under my carpet. I could've gotten blood poisoning or whatever it was called. Anyways... I've been through so much and I'm still fucking alive. Sometimes I wonder that... That maybe... maybe god or someone really wants me to be alive. Just... Maybe. ", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

My Dad yelled at me a lot when taking my phone and I lost it for a fucking week and got mad at me for crying, then walked in later with my mom acting super nice. At this point I've been on and off crying for the past like 2 hours and my dad is gone right now (my mom gave me my phone back for ten minutes but I am refusing to give it back until right before he gets home in like 15 minutes) and I have been trying to ignore my mom. Recently, I've been cutting a lot more than before and at least trying (but failing badly) to cut deeper. I am pretty much insane now and either feel incredibly happy or depressed at any time, and don't even feel emotions correctly anymore. I feel like I'm completely insane but I'm way too scared to tell my mom, my boyfriend and best friend know and both are trying to help me and my best friend is trying to get me to tell my mom that I'm insane but is failing.

Sometimes he'll just say that he's too comfortable to be there for me or that he needs space.
