I've gotten out of bed early, which for me, means spending way too much time overthinking how I should get ready. Like my usual self I spent a chunk of time digging through old clothes, specifically to see if I could wear something besides a graphic tee for once. And what do you know! I found an old blouse buried behind somewhere that fit my liking. It was basic, but had a 3/4 sleeve with a cut out shoulder. Fancy enough for me, plain enough for school.\n\nI got to my home room with no problem. Students were alphabetized into homerooms last year, which meant a room full of random students who's last names started with L and M in my case. Random students = quiet class room, not many of us were very close.\n\nPersonally I love the quiet morning routine. Today was like any other day. I read a bit of a story on my phone waiting for the bell. But I get this weird feeling from a girl a couple chairs away. She's staring at me. I know her name and all but as don't talk. She's a pretty okay if not weird person overall. A bit of a drama queen if you ask around. I brush off the looks and lean more to my left. A moment later, there's a tap on my shoulder.\n\nThis girl is standing over me with the most perplexed look. She gets closer to me with this intense stare at my shoulder, then reaches out to TOUCH ME. Loudly, she says \"OMG ARE THOSE\" and then a whisper *\"self harm\"* back to loud \"SCARS?\"\n\nYeah, I have maybe three faded scars on my shoulder. The thing is, it's no secret! We have swim classes and the shit ton that is covering my legs gets viewed by what, 50 of my classmates every day? No one gives a shit because I'm confident. But she had the AUDACITY to come over to me, touch my scar, and then announce it like some sort of secret to everyone (not that anyone looked at us, as they were too busy with headphones of homework).\n\nI stared her down without a word, giving her a look that said really? I was too tired to even think of a response, and a bit too startled to dignify her with a yes or no. Somehow she thinks this a welcoming conversation topic, immediately smiling. She goes on and on about how \"I self harm too!\" and shows these photos on her phone of barely visible cat scratches. Like she was... proud to be a self harmer?\n\nThe bell rang in the middle of her glorification speech so I did walk away instead of responding. I was shocked for quite a bit. Something has to be wrong with her head if she truly thinks that's an appropriate conversation started or ANYTHING TO BE PROUD OF. I feel pretty bad for whatever she's going through that makes her think that way.\n\nEdit: I'm not calling her scars inadequate guys, it was a description. I started exactly at that point. It was more to say that she was likely a beginning, making the encounter all the stranger for me. This information wasn't necessary to the story, but I did tell a counselor later on so they could call her in and talk about the situation. I know she needed help just as much as any of us.

After awhile the whole self harm thing started to spread around school, and sooner or later almost everyone knew someone who did it and i myself know a few. the three stories that really stuck with me the most was the case of sam and chelsy and edgar (Not their real names). So sams story was no different then most, I remember sitting in the art room chatting with a friend, waiting for the bell to ring so i could head to another class and then sam runs into the room, he looks around the room and spots me then runs over while im talking with my friend \"Jay!\" he calls out to me as he runs over, he leans onto the side of the table and rolls up his sleeve to show a small patch of cuts on his arm \"Look what i did\" he said with a smile, i was shocked and my friend sitting me was to, my friend knew i had been struggling with self harm and sam knew i had done it in the past while word was still running around and he had seemed proud of himself for doing it but i was shocked. Next story. The story of chelsy, Chelsy loved having attention, she had been a huge drama queen about things ect, This one time on her instagram story she started posting her cuts on her arm, it had the \"Ask me a question\" thingy on it too, so everytime someone said something about her self harm she would cut herself again and post it again. And then the story of edgar, its short but bothers me. Anyways so edgar had been known to be one of those Fake gangster tough kids and had been known for getting into drama aswell, so this one time edgar ran up to me in the hallway and he rolled down his sleeve alittle bit to show two really small cuts \"Yo look what i did, i did it with a butter knife when i got really depressed\" he said and i straight up just told him to Fuck off. thats all the end", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I started getting random anxiety for no apparent reason. I started getting urges again.  And today i was playing the piano and started crying. I realised that i don't want to fight those urges anymore. I feel so tired and I kind of just... I don't know, didn't see the point anymore? So I just got a blade out of a pencil sharpener and went to the bathroom. I was scared. It hurt a lot. I couldn't go deep. I just feel so pathetic... They aren't deep enough, they barely even bled... I wanted to go deeper but I was too scared... I feel stupid. I feel like i disappointed everyone. I'm scared someone will see because it's fucking summer. I don't want anyone to see it, I don't want them to know I did it again and get worried. My mom would be so angry and disappointed and disgusted. She's always been disgusted of my cuts. My dad would tell me I'm stupid again... I hate myself for doing this. I hate that now I want to do more. I hate that I keep coming back to this. I hate that my boyfriend is sad and worried (I live with him atm). I know he understands, but I also know it hurts him. I wish I could be better. I want to be a good gf, a good daughter, a good friend. But how can I be any of those when I'm like this? I am disgusting. Why can't I sort myself out? I feel like I'm so fucking stupid. I don't know how to deal with what's going on in my head. \n( I'm sorry this is so long.)", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

My depression and anxiety started a few years ago, but I thought I can control myself and someday it will get better. It wasn\u2019t very useful to smoke a lot of weed and do other drugs. \n\nSo in January \u201819 I decided to stop smoking weed and doing other stuff, so maybe I could get my life together. It was the first time in like 3 years that I was sober for more than 1 week. And I was very depressed at beginning. One day I was cooking and I\u2019ve had a knife in my hand. And I imagined how it would be, if I cut myself now in the arm. I pressed it on my skin and only got a little scratch, but it was the first step into cutting myself. On the next weekend I\u2019ve got very drunk and i wanted to talk to girls in the club. I\u2019ve never had a gf and that\u2019s one of the biggest reasons I hate myself so much. But it happened the way it had to and I got rejected very badly. I went home und cut my arm for the first time. One minute later I had a very bad anxiety attack, about someone seeing the cuts. So I decided to cut myself in the thighs next time. \n\n\nSo the last few months, every time when I was very sad I\u2019ve cut my thighs with a kitchen knife. 3 weeks ago my mental illness went worse and I\u2019ve started to cut myself with a razor blade. I do it like 2-3 times a week and the cuts go deeper than the months ago. Sooo now why I\u2019m making post. I\u2019ve cut myself again in the thighs like 10 minutes ago. Every time I do it, the urge to cut my arm is getting bigger, but I\u2019m afraid, because it\u2019s summer and everyone would see it. I even hold the blade against my veins, but I\u2019m unfortunately to afraid to do... \n\nI really don\u2019t know why exactly making this post. It\u2019s my first time telling my \u201cstory\u201d, also when it\u2019s very shorted. I think I just wanted to write it down and maybe get some feedback of you people.

Before school ended, I\u2019ve been cutting on my arms but I stopped because it was too much and I knew that the scars would take awhile to go away. I\u2019ve been wearing nothing but long sleeves and a jacket. I try acting like my old goofy self around my parents so they won\u2019t have to worry about me. However that stopped for awhile because at this point, it\u2019s hard to fake it when there\u2019s so much going on in my head. I\u2019m taking a break from social media because I\u2019m tired of seeing my \u201cfriends\u201d hang out with each other. It makes me upset to see that they don\u2019t even bother inviting me... I felt like we were the ultimate trio. I hate when this happens because it leaves me thinking what I did wrong for hours. Sucks because I\u2019ve knew one of them for about five fuckin\u2019 years. I want to talk to them about how I\u2019ve been feeling but I feel like there\u2019s this other part of me telling myself \u201cthey don\u2019t care\u201d and I believe it. My siblings have been ignoring me for weeks. They don\u2019t talk to me at all and I feel like they talk crap about me whenever I leave. I could tell they don\u2019t like my presence. Especially my older sister. We can never get along. At all. I want to talk to my parents but I don\u2019t want them to yell at me. I hate to admit it but I\u2019m slightly a sensitive guy. I just want to talk to them, come out to my dad, and you know, just talk to them about my suicidal thoughts. I\u2019m a coward to do so. Plus, my dad told me the other day that suicide was stupid. Which made me more scared to speak with him. There\u2019s no way that I\u2019m talking to a school counselor. The last time I did, they tried sending me away to this mental facility. I get that they\u2019re trying to help but I wasn\u2019t ready to stay there for a week. I\u2019m just trapped in my room with my dark thoughts that haunt me every minute. I hate it. I miss when I was happy. I miss when I didn\u2019t give a fuck about stuff. I haven\u2019t eaten for awhile. Sucks because you have to take it slow when eating to try to get better because your body doesn\u2019t trust you. This happened a couple times before in the past. I haven\u2019t found a good reason for me to get out of bed. I lost my motivation to do my favorite hobbies as well. About a week ago, my mom had ask me if I was okay. Obviously I lied and said yeah. She then asked if I was staving myself. Again, I lied and said no. She also said if I\u2019m hurting myself and began feeling my arms for anything. I lied again. Luckily the scars on my arms healed but they\u2019re still visible. I should\u2019ve talked to her. I\u2019m such an asshole. I hate myself so much. There so many people who are hurting worse that me and I\u2019m over here \u201coh my life sucks and I want to die\u201d I\u2019m so ungrateful.

I bring up feeling ignored because he said we should just talk about it now, I pretty much knew what was going on and my worry was pretty much confirmed. He told me we shouldn\u2019t stay together and I\u2019m torn because I wanted to tell him the truth about the past couple months and me not being myself in an attempt to just stay happy and have people like me but I didn\u2019t get to it. He told me I\u2019m too anxious and essentially a leech. But after that he tells me everything that\u2019s going on with him and I can\u2019t believe I was ever disappointed by him just not talking about jojo with me or some dumb shit. He\u2019s going through a lot more then I ever imagined, then he told me he found out if relapsed.  All I can think of is how I want to take away that pain and just help him and make him happy. I just want to give him a hug, hold him tell him how much he\u2019s loved. He probably doesn\u2019t want me to and I don\u2019t really want to ask because it\u2019s shitty that all I can think of is me in these situations. Everything has to do with me in some way.

Lately I've noticed that my anxiety was coming back but I never really thought much of it. Now here's the thing I've never been diagnosed as bipolar but I'm almost a hundred percent sure I am however I've been diagnosed with severe PMDD and clinical and problematic depression and anxiety and that's about it. I had an anxiety attack about a week ago it wasn't that bad and it was with good reason for me I was put in a situation I wasn't prepared for but last night i had probably the worst panic attack I've ever had I'm calling it a panic attack because I was profusely crying and hyperventilating at times but for the most time I was just laughing like I was a psycho I'm pretty sure that this was actually a manic episode. I had an elastic band on my wrist and I just went crazy and started snapping it harder than ever I also grabbed a pair of medical scissors and started scratching the shit out of my arm I was physically scratching my knees and arms really bad and punching my head and talking to myself after about ten minutes of hyperventilating and laughing Its like i woke up and looked at myself blood was dripping down my legs now I have had a problem with scratching myself to the point of bleeding in the past but this was worse than ever I scanned my body and my arms had swollen from the elastic band and the medical scissors had only scratched me. after seeing blood and seeing scars from the elastic band I went balistic and did it even more laughing and running around my room unable to stay still I was still taking to myself I was completely out of control of myself I did not mean to nor want to do this. This lasted about a half an hour, I wanted to get my mom and tell her I needed to go to the hospital but the manic part of me said \"no you dont need the hospital you dont need meds you dont need sleep you dont need food\" this kind of thinking has happened before but only when I was on a medication that i had a bad reaction to. Now years later it happened again and on the right medication and out of nowhere I relapsed in self harm about a week ago after feeling guilty about having an anxiety attack but the relapse wasn't bad about 25 cuts on my very upper thigh they wearnt deep but they are red and I didn't feel like I wanted to self harm again and I thought I had gone back to normal. Till last night I am honestly quite scared of myself now because this behavior had come out of nowhere and I didn't care how much I was hurting myself and I didn't care how much it would scar. I'm scared because what if I had another episode like this and eneded up seriously hurting myself. The panic attack was brought on by a teary conversation with my mom about how I didn't want my dad to come home from a different province after talking to my mom I went to my room and had this manic/panic episode I was up until about four in the morning jumping around my room and laughing I had stopped hurting myself a half an hour after it started. I finally lied down and fell asleep. I woke up the next morning and was in shock my arms are COMPLETELY bruised all over and I have actual scars from the elastic band the \"scratches\" from the scissors turned into actually cut about 3 very visible ones but the bruises are the most noticeable it looks like someone beat the shit out of me I also have a huge ass bump and bruise on my head I wore a long sleeve shirt today but if wear one tomorrow my mom is going to get suspicious and ask me if I self harmed I cant say \"no I just used my elastic too much\" because of the \"scratching\" my knee scratches are pretty deep but I don't think they can stitch your knee caps. I dont care about scars on my knee caps because I already had plenty from childhood injuries. I'm just so confused and scared as to why tf I did this I'm scared my mom will find out. HOPEFULLY my bruises and scars from the elastic band will be gone by morning the cuts them self's can be easily be hidden but the bruises covering my arms cant. If anyone is actually reading this should I go to the hospital for observation? it's not like it will be my first time for self harm but I just don't want to burden my family with this especially after I've been doing so good.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I\u2019ve talked to countless people and tried everything but my self control isn\u2019t enough. I can\u2019t live my life without razors or scissors and I don\u2019t want to. I\u2019d rather learn not to use them for my purposes. I can\u2019t trust myself anymore. If I try to get help while I\u2019m still a minor my family is gonna know, and the only reason I haven\u2019t killed myself is because I have still preserved a life where no one knows, even if it has hurt. If I lose my untainted life I won\u2019t have any reason to live, so I can\u2019t get professional help. My only hope is to hold on and just try my best ( which has not been enough, considering it\u2019s getting worse ) until I\u2019m an adult so I can officially start taking care of my problem. I want to have a good life but I can\u2019t keep living like this. I haven\u2019t been able to stop in my own. It seems stupid I\u2019m even trying to keep my life together at this point. The only solution I see is complete removal from my normal life until I can make sure I\u2019m not a threat to myself.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I've struggled with anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, and self harm since I was in middle school. I usually only cut when I'm going through a really rough time (bad breakup, family death, etc.). I had a depressive episode last weekend after feeling good for a few months. I started cutting again and now I can't stop. I already have scars on my wrists and upper thighs and it's so embarrassing when my family or friends point them out but I just hate myself so much and always feel the need to cut to prove that I'm worthless. My therapist and psychiatrist have been really keeping an eye on me lately but it's becoming so satisfying and relieving to cut, even though it's only short lived. I don't really know what to do. My therapist says that self harm is a coping mechanism and I can only stop when I'm ready and I don't feel ready yet.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

When I objected and told him I only wanted talk therapy he was very dismissive. He couldn't have spent more than 5 minutes to assess what was even wrong with me in the first place. He told me I should take medication now and assess whether I CBT should be the next step for me within 2 months. I haven't asked my doctor to give me the pills yet but I'm still worried. I've taken Prozac in the past and it gave me weird tremors. Although he didn't say it it felt as if he was implying that if I didn't take these pills I wouldn't be granted CBT out of not trying to better myself.

I need somewhere to share it and i felt like here would fit", "author": "Sakura_Serenity01", "self_text": "So im 14 and when i started cutting i was 12. I wasnt in a good place at all, i was depressed anxious, suicidal and I felt alone. Through the year i worked on my mental state but every tume i got over one thing another would appear until i gave up fighting. Thats when i met someone and fell in love (cheesy i know). With that i decided i wanted to get better not just for myself (mostly for myself) but for her too.\n\nMy problem was i didnt have much time to work on my own mental health cause i am the \"rock\" in my friendship group. If someone had a problem or needed support (long term or short term) i would be there and i would be the one they would go to. I didnt tell any of them of my own struggles as i didnt want them to worry. However with time (about a 6 months) i managed to stop cutting. \n\nAfter being clean of cutting for a month i asked her out and she accepted. Though i had stopped cutting, the urge was still there as was all my anxiety, selfhate and depression. So i struggled with that but didnt let her see as to not worry her. \n\nWe almost were together for 10 months and those 10 months i was mostly clean (other than 2 occasions). However toward the end of our relationship some stuff happened with other people and it lead me to be exhausted. Emotionally, mentally and physically exhausted. But i still made an effort with her. However one day she turned around, broke up with me and then (and still) acts as though im the worst person in the world.\n\nRecently ive been feeling the urge to selfharm again. Part of it is to do with me wanting to heal for her. However most of it is due to some other stuff happening currently that is bringing back all the emotions that used to make me cut. For example : guilt , lack of control , helplessness , anxiety , uslessness , and many others.\n\nI need advice on how to keep clean after i have been for so long. Sorry if this seemed just a post about my breakup but that is currently the event tht has the most emotion stored up as i havent told anyone how much it has impacted me.\n\nThough im talking alot about myself here today im always there for anyone who needs to talk. Honestly if you need someone just pm me and i will respond as soon as i can. Im here for you and even if i only help one person feel better it helps me feel like i have a purpose.\n\nEdit:\n\u2022i wanted to add that i havent cut again yet but i have felt the urge\n\u2022i havent had any suicidal feelings for around 11 months but im more or less in the \"if i die i die\" area\n\u2022im female\n\u2022im always here to talk to anyone that needs it.

I think that every time after I get past a phase, because I\u2019m a fucking moron apparently. \n\nI was venting with my brother in private about my mom in our separate hotel room (we\u2019re on vacation). Turns out she was eavesdropping for about 10 minutes. I guess it\u2019s nothing new, she\u2019s been eavesdropping on me, reading my mail and private messages, etc since childhood (im 24 and have been financially independent since 18). I\u2019m not sure if she heard the part where I said she was more or less the cause of multiple previous relapses.\n\nRegardless, she knocks on the door, then comes in crying and in hysterics. \u201cHow dare you say all this stuff when you have no idea how much I\u2019ve sacrificed for you, etc etc\u201d (also something I even acknowledged while I was venting to my brother)\n\nImmediately went into damage control mode. \u201cNo, of course I don\u2019t think all that stuff about you, I was just mad and thought I was saying that stuff in confidence.\u201d Was able to diffuse the situation and convince her that I meant it. Part of me did mean it at the time because I deal poorly with confrontation, especially forced surprise immediate confrontation. Internally, I meant every word of that shit, angry or not. \n\nI do mean a lot of it, but I\u2019d never fucking tell her because every time I mention something she remotely dislikes, I\u2019ll get yelled at for being unappreciative and ungrateful. Usually I just internalize whatever anger or sadness and then apologize. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to be frustrated with me after I\u2019ve given up my whole life and sacrificed everything for you to be successful. My parents were so much worse to me and I am so progressive compared to other desi (South Asian) parents, you should be ashamed when you know I\u2019d die for you and have fought so much for you, you have no idea.\u201d Which to a large extent is true, I know she genuinely thinks that everything she\u2019s done has been \u201cin my best interests\u201d but she\u2019s done some fuck shit that nobody made her do. And it still doesn\u2019t negate the borderline emotional abuse (ofc that\u2019s not how she sees it nor is it the intent of her actions) and also I\u2019m not a victim fuck you brain\n\nAnyway after she calmed tf down, I dipped into the bathroom, snapped a pen in half and used a blunt jagged edge to cut up my left shoulder. It\u2019s been my go-to spot ever since I started about 10 years ago, easy to hide. \n\nMessaged my gf about it and she (again and somewhat unhelpfully) lectured me on going to therapy. Valid suggestion, but I\u2019m not rly in the mood? She doesn\u2019t have any mental health issues so maybe she doesn\u2019t get it but I guess technically neither do I and also I\u2019m not a fucking victim fuck you brain\n\nSorry for the long post, first post, idk the rules. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m looking for affirmation or solidarity or encouragement or what. A large part of me feels I don\u2019t deserve it. I keep fucking up and I\u2019m a fucking chump for letting my moms words have such strong emotional control over me even though I\u2019m a grown ass adult.

I'm just gonna be honest, she is pretty toxic. She abused me when I was younger and I always feared that it would repeat. The thing is she literally goes mad when she sees my scars or my wounds. She yells at me, has a mental breakdown and she hits herself and cries. It makes everything worse. She tells me that I am hurting her, she says stuff like \"why are you being selfish, why aren't you thinking of me, I am your mother why aren't you talking to me, why are you doing this to me, can't you think of me for one minute and consider how this makes me feel?\". One time we had a fight about this and she said \"it has been four years and I don't see you improving. You always make up an excuse about your things, you don't have anxiety you are faking this. If you have these problems then why aren't you seeking help? Why don't you let me help you, I can't just watch you do this to yourself.\" I got so mad. I don't feel ready to go to a therapist. And I said \"If I don't want you to help me or do anything about this you are gonna f*cking do it, because this is my life and I'm tired of you not seeing my improvements and making me feel like crap. This is not something you have a say about, this time I'm not just gonna stay quiet.\" She couldn't say anything. She just cried. And as expected, later that day she yelled at me again. It's always the same crap. She has a mental breakdown, she acts like I killed someone. She compares my life to other people. Once I jokingly said \"Oh yeah I don't have cancer so I should be grateful for my life, cause if I don't have that everything is all good.\" It was in an ironic tone and even an idiot could understand it. And she said yes... She said \"People have it worse, you are so ungrateful.\" I honestly don't understand how I  survived in this house, oh my god...\n\nThe thing is getting mad or EXTREMELY upset when you see someone's scars is a toxic thing to do. It doesn't help anybody. It makes me feel guilty so I cut more. Oh how the tables have turned lol.

I go to town and don\u2019t even notice it, I don\u2019t even think anyone else notices it cuz i do it so much it a habit. Does anyone else do this?

Because when people talk about SH, their motivations or feelings and whatnot..... I struggle to relate most of the time. And when people who don't SH try to \"\"help\"\" from the outside, they always, always bring up the same things, things I don't relate to, and are baffled when I attempt to explain what it's like for Me.\n\nFor example, cutting for me isn't a \"coping mechanism\". (Supposedly) Most people feel bad or have some kind of personal/emotional crisis, and then SH to \"relieve\" their feelings of anxiety or depression, and then as they do it more they develop a reliance on it to deal with distress. It's a *response*, a \"coping mechanism\". But, I've had urges to SH since I was born. Not in response to things, really, just.... urges all on their own. Happy, sad, neutral, never mattered, my urges to self-destruct have always come and gone as they pleased, never in response to something. And SHing has never Helped me relieve distress or anxiety or depression or anything. Cutting's only function for me has been to relieve my urges to cut, which themselves seemingly have no root. They're just \"natural\" to me.\n\nWhich makes it frustrating and isolating when people try to talk to me about my SH like, \"please, you need to find a better way to deal with sadness/distress :( it's an unhealthy coping mechanism\", when it's not even like that for me. \n\nI also don't hate my scars, at all. I feel incredibly attached to them. Something that also baffles people,,, And, since other people become dependent on SH to \"help\" them, when they stop for a while their urges decrease, right? No matter how long I go without cutting, my urges never decrease. Wanting to SH really does just feel \"natural\" to me.\n\nI just feel disconnected and not understood, especially by people who don't SH themselves,,,, It's so, so frustrating to have my scars looked at pityingly, and for them to try to talk to me and give me \"advice\" in a completely misguided way (no matter how well-meaning). But trying to Explain to them, because all I want is understanding, just makes them more baffled, and more sad, somehow.

Things have gotten so weird that I feel like I should, at least to vent out my feelings.\n\nI haven't harmed myself in years. It used to be bad when I first started but over time I've managed to take control of things, get help, and work on myself somehow. Everything happened around high school/undergrad and a lot of those years are completely blacked out. And like there were points a few years ago I fought urges and was in some bad places, but I never went through with it. Fast forward to last year and I started HRT and it was like the clouds disappeared, I felt happy and ok and everything has been absolutely terrific. But even with all the progress I've made, how happy I've been, there's still urges that pop up from time to time.\n\nThere's been two major instances this year where I felt urges. First was after a date gone wrong a few months back. It's really hard to describe what happened but after the date I felt alone, unloved, isolated, and it triggered past stuff and send me back into a really bad mindset. I didn't harm then but I was extremely close, and I had a difficult time reaching out. The second time is now, and it's part of why I'm feeling so confused. Everything is going fantastic. Other than some money issues, nothing has me down or feeling bad. I've been feeling great but just out of the blue I've kinda hit that low point again. \n\nI don't know who to talk to this, I don't feel like I can talk about it or I feel like I'm going to make friends feel uncomfortable. And unfortunately at the moment, accessing a counselor is difficult (especially for financial reasons).\n\nI don't know, I just feel like detatched from things and there's this sudden urge to resume hurting myself after so many years. It's not even a depressed feeling it's just, boredom and going back to an old routine I think. If anything this is to get it out of my head, not internalize my feelings, and hope I can navigate this.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

This person is now no longer going to be in my life. It's not the first time this has happened.  After something like this happens or any form of criticism I immediately become depressed and have thoughts of self harm. I speak poorly of myself have no self esteem for days after. As much as I fight the feeling it's overwhelming right now. My husband was even asking where I'd like to go on vacation. I told him he should go without me because I don't deserve to I'd ruin it. It's like I want to punish myself for making someone angry or disappointed. Like I don't deserve anything because I can't do as I'm told. I feel that I'm like this because as a child is get beat or screamed at for everything perceived as bad or disrespectful.

I never should have told her, she's just added it to her emotionally abusive arsenal, and she doesn't actually care about me or my mental health. I need help, but I can't afford therapy without my mum's help, and she won't pay for it. I want to leave home, but I can't afford to, and she wouldn't let me.

(Publis bathrooms in my dreams always have very little to no privacy its weird.) I was weirded out but had to go bad so I just ignored her until she asked if I self harmed. At first I said no then figured she saw my scars already so I said yeah.

(It just occured to me that they were boys and in the girl's bathroom for some reason but let's not question that ig.) More friends came into the stall over time and there was a sort of time skip and then my mom comes in too and is angry at me for being in here with other people for over 6 hours apparently so before I have to leave I ask the girl for her number but she says no cause stranger danger or something.\n\nThe dream didn't end there but the rest was unrelated so I won't write about that.

I\u2019ve also been feeling so numb and dissociated that I\u2019ve been burning or scalding myself to make the sensation going away. I\u2019ve been able to get back to the gym in the last day or two and that\u2019s been very helpful and grounding.\n\nOne of my friends insisted on coming with me to my appointment with my psychiatrist and I was really frustrated because I feel like she made a big deal out of my behaviours.

They\u2019re both of the opinion that I\u2019m in a crisis. Meanwhile, I\u2019m sitting there, disagreeing, and then disengaging because just feeling the anxiety and dissociation coming over me like this massive wave.\n\nI managed to advocate for myself to not have to go to hospital or partial hospitalisation because I have two cats and I don\u2019t want them to basically be abandoned except for food for up to two weeks. I managed to convince the psychiatrist that with the input of the local psych people and more regular appointments with doctors, counsellors and the psychiatrist herself and increased seroquel that I should be fine. I\u2019m the first to admit that when I\u2019m feeling like this, I find it very hard to communicate and I\u2019m not always likely to ask for help when I need it. I have an eating disorder as well (bulimia) and it\u2019s a war raging in the back of my head, whether to starve or binge and purge, and it\u2019s usually some combination of the two.\n\nMy psychiatrist very kindly reminded me that people would rather be \u201cburdened\u201d (my words) by my needing support, rather than living with the guilt of what might have been if I kill myself. I want really badly to just curl up in a ball and refuse to do anything at all. I don\u2019t know how to cope, except to shut up and take my medication even though my brain insists I\u2019m fine.

Like a wine glass but thicker and shorter stem (thicker glass overall too). So after none of the remaining pieces were to my satisfaction, I broke one off again. And this one was perfect!

I've been seeing a therapist for 2 years for depression/anxiety, she knows my medical history, but I'm afraid to tell her about my relapse. I don't know how and I'm afraid I'll get admitted. I hate feeling this way, I know it's getting worse, I don't want to hurt myself, I want to feel better, but I'm so afraid of getting admitted again. I'm an adult now so I feel doubtful I'll be admitted against my will, but... I don't know how that's decided. I can't afford the hospital bills, I have a job and need to keep it, I have pets and live alone, family lives too far away to help around the house if I'm gone.\n\nIn the event this is angering to hear, I'm sorry. I'm afraid to talk to anyone in real life so that's why I'm here.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

A letter to my former self. \n\nDear me, 11, \n\nYou're 11 years old and you're hurting. I know you are. You tell people you're fine, yet you look like a zombie as you walk up and down those corridors at school. You're in secondary school now, and it's changed you. You don't think you fit in, you feel all alone and you just don't know what to do with yourself. I know. Trust me, I know.\n\nYour hair is thinning as you continue to binge and purge, making your body so confused it doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s doing with itself, you look pale, you look scared and everywhere you turn there\u2019s another girl, another cruel girl that doesn\u2019t fucking understand why you\u2019re crying. Always, always crying. You think things can\u2019t get any worse at this time because all you are feeling is pain, you\u2019re aching all over and it won\u2019t stop, your heart is sinking by the second and you feel your eyes becoming heavier by the minute, its exhausting living like this. \n\nYou sit down in a corner and your breath quickens, in a panic, but you don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to you, you think you\u2019re dying, you think this is it, as you become more and more paranoid, more and more anxious, more and more overwhelmed by every little thing around you. You become deafened with fear and you feel yourself become lightheaded, you wonder if now is the time you\u2019re going to collapse, as everything around you seems to be... but you don\u2019t. You have to live through this agony but eventually it will pass, and it does. \n\nYou find yourself talking to people twice or even triple your age on the internet as they make you feel safe, you think they\u2019re your friends because you couldn\u2019t find any of your own in your real life because the internet can\u2019t see you\u2019re hurting. But these friends, they\u2019re sharks, and they do know you\u2019re hurting, no matter how much you try and convince them you\u2019re not, because they know that nobody your age would do the awful, awful things they tell you to do for them would do such things. But you don\u2019t care because you\u2019re worthless. But you\u2019re not. That\u2019s all a big lie that you are telling yourself. You are worthy, you\u2019re just unwell.\n\nFive years later, you\u2019ll find yourself in a psychiatric hospital getting help, you will still be hurting but it\u2019ll all be a different kind of pain. You would have learnt things throughout your journey about the sharks and how to keep away from them but you will also have done a lot worse than spoken to a shark by then. But that\u2019s okay.

Then I'd wager that they know u got their back already, like for real.\u00a0\n\nHe/she didn't teach me this intentionally - just through their actions; they just asked how I was doing.  \n  No one else had. (I'm not knocking y'all) I'm talking Facebook friends, I posted a near identical post on the 6th to the one here (on the 6th). Its just amazing really, people on there have known me for years and yet still say stuff like \"anything I can do let me know\" or \"if you ever need to talk..\"  \n  It's cool, you know but like not particularly helpful. Ya find yourself recognizing you need to talk to someone and you're like \" um. who the hell was it I could talk to any time again?\" Or worse, you don't recognize that you REALLY should talk to someone and you forget about that superficial stuff cause you're in a dark place.  \n  I got caught off guard and was really thrilled plus there was some stuff going on too, positive stuff that I didn't feel like sharing everywhere yet. -(My problem was caught early. Stage 1. Another scan in Nov. I should be in good shape).\n\nI'll wrap this up now (everyone: THANK GOD!)).

The psychiatrist said that I didn\u2019t need to go inpatient because I wouldn\u2019t kill myself, so that was pretty good.\n\n\tBut honestly, looking back on what I used to do (I used to draw on myself with my own blood, would laugh when I self harmed, etc. I just thought it was one big joke and it didn\u2019t matter much...) I probably should have been admitted because I didn\u2019t think hurting myself was a big deal.

It's obviously a bit hot there so it was hard to hide my cuts from my family and friend meaning I either had to wear my one long-sleeved shirt or wear a thick-ish jacket. At the end of the painfully scary 2 weeks, I'm convinced my family are a bit concerned and may know what's happened to me. Now, because we had to get up at 3am for our flight at 7-ish, I was an idiot and put on a short sleeved shirt and my jacket to go to the airport. We left from heathrow airport near London and, for some reason, I was fine not to take off my jacket while going through security. Except, in the Spanish airport, it was different. They seemed strict. The man at the security scanner thing was gesturing for me to take off my jacket which reeeaaalllyyy wasn't what I wanted to do. My cuts are only in the inside of my forearm and there's only about 11 of them, not deep, so it wouldn't be too hard to hide under normal circumstances, except in this case my parents would have been looking in that general direction since they already had some suspicions. I quickly ran to the security guy, and just quietly said something like \"I can't take it off, I really can't, please let me keep it on\", he was still saying no. Great. I ended up flipping up my jacket a bit, showing him inside, he sighed, said okay, and let me through. That was honestly the scariest time of my life. I was physically shaking and felt like I was going to explode with sweat flying everywhere. I've ordered a couple more shirts now so hopefully I'll have a better chance at finding them.

She knew about my disorder. She said i was faking it.\n\nIt was medically diagnosed when i was 7; i even have medication for it now, (which i dont take)\n\nI felt so humiliated by the guidance counselor,\n\nBetrayed by my best friend.\n\nSo what was the point of explaining all this?\n\nIts been years.\n\nThis is all i can think about.\n\nThis shattered my trust. I now have issues communicating my basic thoughts, because of how scared i am, of it somehow ending like this. This is very hard for me to talk about.\n\nI never tell people personal things. I never open up fully. I never talk to my parents about things.\n\nI have a pretty bad issue with cutting because of it.\n\nSometimes i spend hours at a time, on and off sobbing and cutting, just thinking about all this. I'm completely isolated from my family. I have almost no friends.\n\nI'm so terrified and i dont know why i cant get over this.\n\nevery time i see her i break down\n\nMy life is centered around crying over something that happened years ago.

Basically, I\u2019ve suffered with diagnosed depression, PTSD, and social anxiety disorder for the past three years of my life. In the beginning I knew I was really sad and thought maybe I had been depressed but when I learned that I suffered from three mental illnesses I lost my shit. Before the only time I\u2019ve ever gone to the psych ward(hopefully) I would be punching myself as hard as I could on a daily, whether it was in the face or on my legs, I would do whatever it took to feel the pain. Smashing my head into walls, punching myself in the eye in hopes of someone noticing bruises, etc. And now recently I\u2019ve been going through my worst depressive episode yet and I\u2019ve started cutting. I started because I\u2019ve been hanging out with people who cut too and I have just lost my best friend(to a big fight) and the pain I was feeling wasn\u2019t being suppressed like I needed it to be with the punching. So, I decided I would cut myself for the first time(probably around a couple weeks ago) and now that I\u2019ve started I can\u2019t seem to stop. I wanna cut when I\u2019m sad, when I\u2019m bored, even when I\u2019m happy. It\u2019s an addiction. I enjoy the pain and the suffering it gives me. I just read a post on this reddit page about how once you start you can\u2019t stop, and it is COMPLETELY true. As I continue to do it I get more and more scared of if my parents will find out. I really don\u2019t want to head back to the psych ward but that would seem to be my best bet at this point. I don\u2019t want to ruin anybodies summer and that\u2019s the main reason why I\u2019m so scared to show my parents. Everyone around me is noticing I\u2019ve been down. My grandma, mom, dad, siblings, EVERYBODY. And it\u2019s really only a matter of time before I get caught. I love them all to death and I know if my mom or dad finds out they\u2019ll both be crushed. My mom couldn\u2019t even sleep the last time I was in the hospital. My grandma took me on a trip and I slept the entire time, she has been so extremely worried about me. And it\u2019s hard to fake it around her cause she was married to my grandpa, who suffered from extremely bad depression(so bad he had to get electroshock therapy numerous times) so I can\u2019t even lie, she\u2019s been texting me about how she hopes I get better and that she misses \u201cthe old me\u201d. \ud83d\ude43that line makes me the saddest.

I'm not getting sleep either and I'm just stressed all the time around them. When I tell them that they are a part of the problem, my mom says that I need an attitude change.

This is my first time posting to Reddit (I'm pretty new), so I hope this is alright. \n\nI'm 21 now, and I used to self-harm back in middle and high school.

Maybe this is strange, but they feel like something that belong to me and only me-- like, I feel as though I've claimed my body through them in some way. (I don't know if other women sometimes feel like their body is a sexual object, but my scars remind me that my body is more than that, and is mine and not the property of people who want me sexually.)\n\nIn any case, I'm pretty comfortable with and even fond of my scars at this point.  They aren't too visible if you aren't looking for them, but I don't make any effort to hide them or cover them up either. Most of the ones that are visible are on my shoulder. \n\nIs it okay for me to not hide my scars?  I don't want to cause any anxiety for people who are triggered by seeing self-harm scars, but I also don't want to lose this feeling of having ownership over my body.

(this part i didnt know at the time but i found out the next morning when my mom asked if i noticed her checking on me)\n\nbut she didnt see anything because i had turned off all light sources and it was to dark to see.\n\nso back to me, hiding behind the bathroom door, with a bunch of gauze in my pocket. after she went back to her room i ran to the guest room which has kinda turned into my area. its has my desktop and a steady supply of self harm materials.\n\nso i prepped myself with the gauze pads and grabbed my razor and cut like hell. and for the very first time, i posted it one sh pics. ive used the site for some time now but never posted. 2 week clean streak out the window. while i was doing this my sister used the restroom again but it didnt faze me this time. and instead of cleaning up with the gauze i took, i used toilet paper and scotch tape (yeah it hurt taking off).\n\nand then i went back to sleep. or tried.\n\ni ended up going to my mom and she made me use real bandages and then i went to sleep.\n\nthe next morning (this morning) i turned the razor into my therapist and now were debating residential. (my deal was one cut and i get sent, bc this is eating disorder treatment and they arent equipped to properly hand self harm)\n\nif your still here... thanks. and yes, this entire time i felt like James fucking Bond and Shawn Spencer combined.", "subreddit": "MadeOfStyrofoam"}

I tried that and I really liked it, so I wanted to share some stuff I've found successful too. My cutting is usually a result of anxiety, and I turn to it to neutralize the pain/get distracted/get a physical release. Once I pinpointed why I do it, it made figuring out what to do instead a lot easier.\n\n\\- Watching a really immersive high-stakes or fast-paced TV show. She-Ra and Aggretsuko are reeeeeally good, one's more action and the other is relationship-based. I love animation so maybe I'm biased haha\n\n\\- Doing crafts, which sounds so silly but it's sooooo fun. Like literally making beaded bracelets and those lanyard keychain thingies. It's nostalgic, and I get a sense of \"finally I have better dexterity than I did when I was 8\" and can actually make really cool things. I've been considering making something like that to commemorate the hurdles: a certain color scheme for when I need to avoid cutting, and another to commemorate how long I've been clean. Once a week til I hit a month, then once a month til I hit 3, 6, and then a year. Might be cool to try :) \n\nThese are soothing, concentration-based activities though, and sometimes my mind can't rest like that. Sometimes I need something stronger to combat my need for a physical, painful release. I'm not one to exercise though, and going outside as a woman at night in the city isn't a great idea. So my therapist advised punching my mattress. I haven't tried it yet, but it sounds p nice. Something good to shake out the anxiety, give my body a reason to have such a high heart rate, sweating, need to move and feel the burn in a better way yknow?\n\nI hope these help somebody. It's silly and hard to put aside your shame to buy some beads at the craft store, but it's better than cutting. godspeed &lt;3", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

So imagine my shock when i sat down at my desk and found two slightly rusted pencil sharpener blades placed at the side of my desk. \n\nNobody knows about my SH, but my first immediate thought was that my colleagues found out and put it there to confront me about it. But then i remembered i had actually lost 2 blades recently at work, and i guess my kind-hearted colleagues (this is genuine btw it\u2019s not sarcasm) must've found them on my forever messy desk and put them where i could see them (this seems weird but my department is really small and people are always coming to place/take things from my table so yeah).

Q's account of what was happening to her wasn't very clear, like she said at some points that she had blacked out, and some points said she didn't need to go to the hospital because she never lost conciousness (i think)\n\nat that time I had a strict time to switch my phone off by, and I had to leave that day thinking that i had lost 3 very close friends of mine (including my best friend) - i can't describe how horrific that felt\n\na few months later, out of curiosity, I googled how much of that drug it would take to kill her/black out/have no effect/etc for someone of her weight. the numbers didn't add up, if I remember correctly - the dosage would have made her a bit wavy, but wouldn't have made her black out (but like i said, her account of what happened wasn't reliable)\n\nskipping ahead, that day aside, she also (unconvincingly) catfished me under 5/6 (?) names and accounts (some while we were dating and some while we werent)\n\nthat destroyed my mental health more than anything else and to this day i don't know why *that* affected me so much. maybe it was the betrayal of trust? i don't know\n\nwhile we were dating Q would also always say things like \"you are/this relationship is the only thing keeping me alive\" and I just couldn't deal with that\n\never since then, I've been haunted by her, there's no other way to put it, I \"see\" her everywhere I go and i was obsessed - i had screenshots of every conversation that we ever had and evedence to back everything up saved to my phone and computer at all times (id like to report that I have since deleted them all!)\n\ni was intensely paranoid that she would find me (despite not knowing where I live) and had panic attacks on the regular about it and I couldn't trust anyone online (or in my real life up to a point) because theres a possibility that it could be something to do with her\n\ni am 18 in a few months now and a couple of months ago, I confronted her. i told her that I knew everything about the catfishing amongst other things (i didn't bring up the overdose though) and she apologised and begged me not to share the screenshots after I said that I would if she ever did it again\n\nit felt amazing\n\ni felt free, and I have not thought about her nearly as much for months and im so happy for it, it's still tough sometimes, i still have nights like these where my thoughs spiral. i also haven't brought myself to block all contact from her but im still making progress\nand I will continue to get better\n\nthank you to if anyone at all read all that. honestly I feel a lot better already. that isn't the whole story but they're the main parts and like I said - im making progress and hope to forget Q forever one day. \nim so glad I have a safe space like this to talk, thank you reddit, and goodnight x", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Abusive parents, eating disorders, undiagnosed miscellaneous issues (I really don't know what's wrong with me. Depression? Idk. Something. Haven't talked to an actual doctor about it), the whole shebang. I also have a tendency to pick at my face, skin, and hair until it's bleeding.\n\nThis last year was rough. Graduating high school, and now starting college is stressful. I broke up with my girlfriend because my eating disorder got so bad I got angry at her for telling me what I thought were lies. Home life got a lot harder. Lots of stuff to make existing a bit more difficult.\n\nAt some point, I picked up this habit of dragging razor blades across my skin, which was startling because I've always had a fear of sharp things. Something felt really satisfying in the sensation of metal scraping across my skin, but never actually cutting into it.\n\nI got some bad news today and I didn't handle it very well. At some point, I don't remember when, I started dragging this blade across my skin on my thigh. Eventually I wanted more of the sensation so I started to drag the sharp edge across harder and with more purpose. I never realized how easy it is to break the skin.\n\nIn the span of 10 minutes, my thigh had a sliced up area about the size of a jumbo index card. None of them are very deep because I didn't want to make a mess and I don't want scars, but they're there. Little beads of blood welling up at the seams. I think they'll heal okay, but I don't know much about scars.\n\nThe part that scared me is that I liked it. It made me calm down. It made my hands shake less and my breathing even out. I stopped crying and I had something to focus on. The feeling brought me back to my centre I think. Throughout the day I found myself touching my thigh or squeezing it to feel the pain when I started to feel any sort of stress.\n\nI know this isn't a great habit to form, but nothing has ever helped me this much, and I'm honestly not sure I'll be able to keep from doing it again.\n\nJust wanted to talk about it.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

If i punch it multiple times i know it will do some damage to my knuckles, which is what i want. I want my hand to bleed a little bit. Sometimes i listen to rock/metal songs and some just make me punch the walls. It comes naturally.\nThe thing with tighs is that i used to cut my arms  (never deep). Because it's more easy for my family to find them i want to try with my tighs. Since April i honestly haven't had a real urge, but a few times i just thought of doing it.

Some of you may recognise me, but I think a lot of you won\u2019t. Last I was here, it was a community of about 10,000, now it\u2019s 30,000. And that is great, more people are joining a community of support and understanding\nBut, anyway, um, to those that do know who I am, I want to apologise. I used to be on the mod team, and before that I was actively (I would like to think) helping for about 2-3 years. The last post I remember making was something along the lines of \u201cHi, I\u2019m back!\u201d (after I took a short break) and then I went awol until now. \n\n\nIt was never an active decision I made to not come back and help you guys, it just kinda happened. Life got in the way. And after so long being away, it felt like an insult to come back and say \u201chi how\u2019s everyone doing?\u201d after I essentially deserted you. \nSo, I am sorry. Genuinely sorry, I don\u2019t know if people were angry at me or not, or annoyed, or whatever. I should have talked to the mod team about my leaving after it happened.\nSj, Rach, Evie, I hope you\u2019re doing well and I\u2019m sorry for deserting you. \n\n\nBut now I\u2019m going to be selfish and talk about myself. Haha.\nI\u2019m doing bad at the moment. I\u2019ve dealt with intrusive thoughts about dying for so long that it\u2019s become normality. Telling myself that I want to die, etc. A few years ago, as a promise to friends, I made the decision that I won\u2019t ever take my own life. And I have stuck to that, and I will stick to that in the future.\nHowever, now something has happened that I didn\u2019t think would. The thoughts have gotten louder. They\u2019ve twisted the positive decision that I made to not take my life into a negative one. Telling me that I am now trapped here without escape. Wars wage in my head between logic and darkness. I tell myself that there is so much love and potential in this world, but I only get the reply of that there is so much more hate, greed, and corruption. In my eyes, the balance is off. \nThe last thing I want to do with this post is trigger other people. I really, really don\u2019t want to bring other people down to my level world-hatred. But I needed to express this.\n\n\nLastly, once again, I am sorry. I\u2019m not going to make any promises about \u201ccoming back\u201d this time. And I do realise the selfishness in that. I express my own problems whilst not helping others\u2019. I think it\u2019s because I used to be a mod here that I feel like I\u2019m not doing my duty of helping.\n\nI\u2019m going to stop rambling now. \n\nAll of my best to everyone here. I love you all, I don\u2019t even have to know you or talk to you. If you are here reading this, that gives me reason enough to love you. \n\nStay safe,\nLewis \u2764\ufe0f", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

My whole life I had always been super happy and I loved school and I played video games and sports and hung out with my friends and it literally all changed so quick I don\u2019t know what happened exactly. My first semester of freshman year (I\u2019m a junior now) was great as usual then the very first day of second semester I made a tiny mistake that no one even noticed and I went to the bathroom and cried for like an hour, I\u2019d never been one to cry I don\u2019t know what struck me but since that day every little things that goes wrong just makes me panic all I think about is school there is nothing else and I don\u2019t understand why, at this time I have a 4.3 so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing bad and lately I\u2019ve been having a stronger feeling that life is just pointless honestly what is the reason for everything I\u2019ve never been religious but I went to church the other day just to try to find something. A few weeks ago I had a falling out with the only person in my life who knew about everything and cared and I feel so alone now. I started cutting a few days after, it went from just wanting to try to see why people do it to being practically a daily thing I\u2019ve been cutting on one thigh but it\u2019s so much there\u2019s no part of the area where you can really see normal skin and a few are so deep I bled for like 14 hours straight and felt light headed and now I\u2019ve recently started doing my other thigh and upper arm but I\u2019m scared people will notice but I can\u2019t stop it\u2019s the only thing that distracts me from the feeling that life is meaningless and it only gets worse from here on out. The worst part is I have no one to talk to no one cares, I\u2019ve loaded up my schedule again with all AP and honors classes and I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s what everyone expects of me. I never planned on killing myself at the start but I\u2019ve been thinking about things lately in the idea that \u201c if I make it to that point I\u2019ll deal with it then\u201d and I\u2019m scared I don\u2019t want to die but I don\u2019t know what else to do, I\u2019m sorry if I put this in the wrong place or broke some rule, thanks-bk", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Let me try to sum it up: in third grade my life took a bad turn when my dad got fired from his job and instead of going back to work, insisted on being a starving artist. My mom was sick so she couldnt work. We had really bad financial issues from then on. I learned my dad was a narcissist and had to listen to them scream at eachother and be manipulated by him for years, its still happening. I'm sixteen now. Homeschooled, completely isolated. I recently started therapy for PTSD/severe anxiety/paranoia/Aspergers (the last thing, we only found out I had this year, we never knew before), and also for dysohoria issues since i am transgender. I had one close friend online who lived in another state kind of far away, we were friends through the best and the worst for about five years. I was in love with her for the later three years. I told her, last year, on July 3rd, and she felt the same. She was the only person who truly made me feel same, she felt like home.\n\nTwo months ago, I madre an impulsive decision. I convinced myself that I was dragging her down with my issues, and that soon she would be depressed too, and maybe even hurt herself. The thought of that terrified me. So I broke ties with her. My family and I were then illegally evicted from our home with only 4 days to pack everything and move somewhere else. We became homeless and had to sleep in our car for a night, but thankfully we're currently staying in an air b&amp;b. I went back to my old habits of confiding in that friend I mentioned; i started messaging her again, and once I did, I couldnt stop. She saw it all and answered the night before yesterday, she was euphoric and so happy to see me again. Bu she doesn't know if she still loves me as more than a close friend that's basically family to her. I don't want to lose her again but I cant stick around if I have to watch her live her life with other people and just be a friend she keeps around. I love her so much, and everything that' happened in my life could never make me feel as heartbroken as i do now. I cant sleep, i cant eat, all I can do is hug my dog and cry. \n\nI've considered cutting since I was twelve, but I was too afraid. But honestly I think I might. I know I'll be an even bigger disappointment if I do, but I can't take it. I deserve the pain. I know where my mother's blades are. \n\nThese thoughts terrify me. I just had to vent. I dont want to go down that road but at the same time...i think thats out of my hands now. \n\n\nTLDR: I've had depression since 3rd grade, it's getting worse, I'm considering cutting, I think it's inevitable at this point.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Sometimes it's bad sometimes it's not, however I never self harm to end my life. Like a lot of people, I self harm purely to escape the mental pain I'm suffering and transfer some into physical pain. It's not something I enjoy doing and normally only happens when I'm in a moment of complete loss and not myself. When I come out of that moment and realise what I've done, I am normally so ashamed and end up having to hide myself for weeks.\n\nLast Saturday I had one of these moments, and when I had come around there was not one part of my body I hadn't cut. My torso, my neck, both arms and both legs were horrifying. I went into the normal mindset of digging out all my long sleeved modest clothing to hide myself for weeks until they have healed.\n\nHowever, I remembered I had a work thing on the following Friday (tomorrow) that I cannot miss and I also cannot alter what I was due to wear (ngl, we're having a costume competition at work and we are going in teams, our theme is Scooby-Doo and theres no way i can let the guys down a Shaggy) meaning my arms are going to have to be out. I panicked and worried a lot about this over Sunday until I decided to do a little bit of research. \n\nAfter a quick Google search I found an article advising to use Petroleum Jelly (Vaseline) after cleaning the wound, to help keep moisture in the skin and close the wounds quicker (also with less scarring apparently). I was a bit sceptical about this but couldn't find anything else to help so thought what the hell and gave it a shot.\n\n5 days later, after applying Petroleum Jelly to the wounded area 2-3 times a day, I have found that the healing process has significantly accelerated. My cuts are still obvious but they are no where near as prominent and open as they were on Saturday. This stage normally takes me at least 2 weeks to get to, so essentially it has doubled the speed in which it has healed! Something I honestly did not expect to happen! I'm still a little bit anxious about tomorrow but I feel a lot more confident with getting my arms out and dressing up with everyone as planned. For someone with major anxiety, especially with my scars/wounds, it was so amazing to see the healing work so quickly through the week and honestly has made me feel so much better and less stressed about having my self in view of everyone. \n\nLike I said (what feels like a million words ago now), this may be well known and I may have just been slow to find out but I wanted to post something about it and share my experience with people so hopefully if there is anyone who struggles with this and doesn't know just like I didnt, then I have been able to help (hopefully). Even if it's just one person then it would be worth the energy I've put into this post (normally I can never really open up and discuss myself, especially on a social media site. So me sharing this on here is a big step for me).\n\nIt may not work for you or it may, I'm not sure but its definitely helped me. Self harm is a big enough thing in itself, so the last thing needed is for me to be anxious for weeks on end about anyone seeing anything, it just adds more to the heaps of crap and makes the whole self harm stigma stick with me for weeks on end so finding this out has been amazing for me as its helped so much with keeping my anxiety at bay! Hopefully it may be able to help someone else, I dont know but I thought it was worth a shot! \n\nSorry about the long read, but thanks for listening if you made it through haha :) \n\nStay safe redditors\u2764", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I think this is because my best friend at the time really glorified self-harm and made it look like a really beautiful thing and I really looked up to her, so I ended up looking at my own self-harm differently. My therapist said my brain probably perceives it as a form of self-care and when I stop I feel so awful about myself that I just end up going back to it. And ladies and gentlemen, this is the actual problem with romanticizing self-harm and mental illness, it truly sucks. Cutting is the only way I feel pretty, and I know, that's disgusting, but that's how I look at it, because that's what I was subject to for years until I stopped hanging out with that friend who was really my only friend for a really long time, so yeah.

And oh boy do i crave recognition.", "author": "forrestlurrkerr", "self_text": "I registered for another semester of classes at the community college i attend but i only signed up for one class because ive been so fucking depressed. I have no drive to do anything i have no motivation i have no energy. My room is trashed and i can barely wash my sheets weekly. Let alone do anything around the house. Which i get chewed out for but no one else seems to do anything yet they don\u2019t called freeloaders.\n\nI didnt attend school over the summer. I have job and no license. My previous psych called me a freeloader, although at that time i had been going to school so i was doing something. Most of what i do all day is lay in bed. I can only get to sleep at 3am but its better than when it was 6.\n\nI told my parents that I successfully signed up for a biology class. My brother has taken me and they probably would have kicked me out if i didnt sign up for anything. The class is one day a week, monday. Its half online, half on campus for labs so i will be getting out of the house. Im thinking i\u2019ll try to practice driving so i can get my license and then at least be able to take myself to school, and then i\u2019ll work up to getting a job. But even that wont be enough for anyone.\n\nI thought my parents knew i was depressed? I told my mom about implementing my iep at school. I had an iep in highschool because i was constantly overwhelmed with work and also bc of anxiety and depression. I literally spend so much time in my room that my mom thinks im always sleeping, which is a symptom of depression that i have heavily experience before and i guess somewhat do to an extent. She even called my psych b/c she was worried about me. every time i see my psych she increases the dose of my antidepressant. My mom is nosey as fuck after appointments so i tell her about medication changes.\n\nMy mom knocked on my door earlier to ask about the class. \u201cOnly one class?\u201d i told that im feeling overwhelmed because i couldn\u2019t tell her that im depressed without crying. Her response: \u201cyou\u2019re overwhelmed?\u201d Like a fucking idiot. You called my psych b/c you knew i was depressed. I talked to her and told her that im having trouble sleeping. I cant believe she would act like like she doesnt know anything ?!? Then she started her spiel: \u201cIm 62 i want to retire etc etc etc\u201d so i told her to shut the door and she kept talking but i put my headphones back in and ignored her because she wouldn\u2019t leave. She talked a little then slammed the door behind her.\n\nI figured that she brought it up with my dad too, or vice versa. So i checked the texts from my dad on my phone. I have my parents muted because my mom is always blowing up my phone throughout the day and its fucking annoying, wether i change the ringtone or not. My dad rarely texts me or texts back so its like he was never muted in the first place.\n\nHe had given me the same spiel my mother had. \u201cOne class? Where does the extra time go? You\u2019re going to take 15 years to get a degree. I want to retire in 4 years.\u201d After those four year he will no longer be paying for college. Which is understandable but if they wanted to retire at a decent age/have money for a decent retirement they should have thought twice about having three fucking children. i hate having boomers for parents. They don\u2019t understand anything.\n\nI tried to tell my dad that im depressed. Although i probably did it in a really bitchy and whiny way. In that same way I expressed that i feel like a financial burden and that i\u2019ll never be good enough. Both of which i have expressed around the time i was first put in a hospital.\n\nHis response: \u201cBoohoo\u201d\n\nUp until that second that i read that response never in my life have i ever wanted to kill myself more. I wanted to text him back \u201cthis is why i want to kill myself\u201d\n\nThe medicine doesnt seem to be making it all that easier to cope with the shit my parents are putting me through. My mom wont admit to having done or saying anything wrong. My dad constantly defends her and never me. I\u2019m pretty sure my moms a narcissist.\n\nI would love to carve words into my skin but i would feel stupid like im copying that character in sharp objects. I just dont want it to be taken that way if anyone were to see it. It doesnt feel genuine i guess. If i had to pick a first word it would be boohoo.\n\nI have such an urge for the outside of my right thigh which has been there for a day or two and recently i pried the blade out of a cheap single blade razor because my other one is dull as fuck so i guess its a party tonight.\n\nI feel fucking immature admitting this i know i have shit to work on but im very conflicted to if i am mature or not my friends said i am and ive had a lot teachers say so but my parents and my ex bf (basically the people who have hurt and abused me) always say that I\u2019m immature, childish, emotionally inept, irrational, etc\n\n\nI seem to be having an issue lately posting the right thing or in the right place so if this post poses an issue, mods please let me know. I also don\u2019t mind deleting it. I would also appreciate a recommendation to a different sub where this wouldn\u2019t break rules or be inappropriate, if this one is.

It's been alright up until a couple of weeks ago, when I started getting urges again. I just want to cut again, feel the happiness, see my body all fucked up and bleeding, because it's meant to be that way. I don't deserve a body that isn't cut up. The possibility that I might cut again has become normal, and I'm finding less of an urge to not do it, to the point where there's only the action of me doing it holding me back. I don't even have a solid reason, either. Yeah, life's been a bit shitty. Yeah, I've been feeling a bit down lately. But there isn't a solid, valid reason like some form of emotional trauma happening.\n\nI haven't been feeling very real recently. The world has felt fake, like it's all just made up in my head and I'm in an insane asylum somewhere, just imagining it all up. The possibility that that could be correct makes me feel sick.\n\nMy scars have been itching and hurting more than usual lately, but you can hardly call them scars. They're very disappointing. If I do cut again I want more styros. I won't tell anyone I'm doing it again, because that just caused a mess and did more damage than it healed. Only people on the Internet.\n\nI know I'll be disappointed in myself, and I know that pit was dark, and I know I might hate the scars in future. But the pit was fun. It's what I deserve.\nI don't know when I'll cut again, be it tonight or in a week. But the thought of it both makes me excited and sick. I can't wait, but I also want to wait. Is it normal for the muscles in the area you cut to tense up when you think of cutting again?\n\nI just wish I never got into this, but I was into it way before I thought to stop. I was young, punching my arms for punishment and because I was angry and wanted to lash out. I was always into self-mutilation, I loved the idea of physically harming my body, it was a delightful thought.\n\nI guess this is my life now.

Sit your asses down &amp;amp; listen up! I\u2019mma tell the shit you gotta go through to cater to your lovely lesions! Your boy here is kind of...concerned, i noticed plenty of posts about toilet paper as bandages and that\u2019s fucking nefarious, my dudes. Buckle up, let\u2019s go on some first-aid tutorial shit.  \n\nIn this guide we\u2019ll go in-depth on everything you need to know about this dangerous coping mechanism, how to care for it, how to manage the tools you use to self harm, infections &amp;amp; disease, know the layers of skin and what you nicked, the aftermath, scars and consequences of all this shit. \n\nPs. I\u2019m no doctor, just some fucking guy who worked as a sidekick to veterinarian &amp;amp; also experienced in self-harm :p\n\nPs. Ps. I\u2019m currently sleep deprived, i\u2019m probably gonna edit it alot, adding info or throwing in a few humorus comments, just a heads up for the many edits incoming.\n\n* **Part 1: surfaces cuts/Cat scratches**\n\nDefinition of surface cuts: **breaking/cut in the first layer of the skin; the epidermis.**  those are easy to care for, even not caring for it can do, **however**, that doesn\u2019t mean you can just neglect them, you little rascal! Especially if you have a weakened body/malnourished or your immune system is slightly fucked, you gotta aid your body with protecting itself from mucky-bacilli. \n\n1. wash area with lukewarm distilled water or a [saline solution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)).\n\n2. Disinfect the area with [isopropyl alcohol 70%](https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/walgreens-isopropyl-alcohol-70-first-aid-antiseptic/ID=prod6373261-product) or [povidone-iodine 10%](https://m.indiamart.com/proddetail/betadine-povidone-iodine-solution-16832463897.html)\n\n3. If you wanna be fancy, you can apply antibiotic cream or [ointment](https://www.amazon.com/Neosporin-Original-Antibiotic-Infection-Prevention/dp/B001ECQ778) although not needed.\n\n4. Bandage them with [Band-aid](https://www.amazon.com/Gamago-Bandages-Bob-Ross-Pound/dp/B07D7Y37ND) , plasters or any bandage really. \n\nChange daily (24 hours), but still keep an eye out for symptoms of infections, even something as small as a scrape can get infected! \n\n**Side note:** stay away from pools, sea or body of water! Especially in 3rd world countries, there\u2019s a shitload of serious bacteria in water surfaces aka flesh eating bacteria and such, it\u2019s best not jump into dirty places with broken skin.\n\n* **Part 2: Dermis cuts/Styros**\n\nThe second layer of the skin, the Dermis, this layer is white colored and looks like styrofoam (hence the name) This is a pretty dangerous depth, you\u2019re testing the waters here, you can cause serious nerve damage, more\nProne to infections, nick veins and arterials &amp;amp; leave long lasting damage. Understand that depth does not make your problems invalid, depth doesn\u2019t mean you are less deserving of treatment or \u201cnot good enough\u201d! \n\n1. Flush wound with distilled water or saline solutions, get the icky out. Blicky Stiffy uh.\n\n2. Apply antiseptic iodine solution, you can use clinical cotton pads instead of spraying it right into this bitch.\n\n3. If the cut is gaping open but not stitches worthy, use [Steri-strips](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nexcare-Steri-Strip-Skin-Closure-1-2-in-x-4-in-18-Strips/45394865) or [Butterfly bandages](https://www.seton.com/goodsense-butterfly-bandages-9122c.html) to close them, however, if you don\u2019t have those, you still gotta close that hole, so [makeshift](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/health-topics/hw200876) a butterfly bandage.\n\n4. Smear that gash with sexy antibiotic cream/ointment, preferably use a [wooden tongue depressor](https://www.medistorebd.com/product/tongue-depressor-wood-100pc/) or Q-tips, not your barehands, you barbarian. \n\n5. Apply a [wound dressing](https://m.indiamart.com/proddetail/sterile-medicated-wound-dressing-10738679733.html) , to help stop blood from sticking to the bandages and painfully get ripped off.\n\n6. You Must cover that lesion, preferably use [sterile gauze pads](https://www.amazon.com/Gauze-STERILE-100BX-DYNAREX-Corp/dp/B004N15MH8) secured with tape on the edges, rather than plasters; to let them air out.\n\n7. To control bleeding, you can use an outer [cotton/elastic compression bandage](https://m.indiamart.com/proddetail/compression-bandage-3305766662.html) to reduce blood flow.\n\nChange daily, or when it\u2019s dirty or soaked. and when i say change i mean go through this cleaning process again, not just the bandage! Ps. Keep your eye peeled open like a fucking clementine, cause this depth is prone to infections. \n\n* **Part 3: Fat cuts/Stitchies**\n\nOh boy, this layer is yellow, bubbly fat tissue, you can sometimes get glimpse of the bubble spilling out in deep styros, basically the dermis leftover holding it together, this one is Dang-O-Rous, dudes. There has been many case of accidental suicides, bloodloss can make you pass out quick and there may not be someone who could help, please understand that whatever that voice tells you, how you need to \u201cprove\u201d how bad you are mentally, is fucking bullshit. \n\n1. Best option here is go to the hospital, get professionally treated &amp;amp; stitched up well, **you need to get it stitched.** it\u2019s best not to DIY this guy.\n\n2. If medical attention is not possible, flush lesion with lukewarm distilled water or saline solution NaCl 0.9%\n\n3. Stitches are a must here, if not available, you can try to steri-strip it, however it wont be effective, it will leave a hollow inside while only closing the top of the skin. \n\n4. With fat cuts, you can\u2019t put anything directly inside the tissue! Only apply antiseptic iodine to the edges &amp;amp; around the wound.\n\n5. Apply a wound dressing, it can be [medicated mesh wound dressing](https://m.indiamart.com/proddetail/sterile-medicated-wound-dressing-10738679733.html) , [Mepitel](https://www.ahns.com.au/product/wound-care/mepitel-silicone-dressing-5cm-x-7-5cm-box-of-10/) to help stop blood from sticking to the bandage; resulting in it ripping it off.\n\n6. Apply antibiotic cream/ointment to the edges of the cut, not inside.\n\n7. Preferably cover using gauze pads secured with medical/paper tape on the edges, use an out compression bandage to control bleeding. \n\n**note:** fat cuts heal kinda ugly &amp;amp; looking infected, but that is a normal part of the healing process! In the first week you may see your cut looking yellow-ish or cloudy pus, but without an odor! Just keep attention to other symptoms.\n\nChange daily, duh, but remember the \u201ckeep your eyes peeled like clementine\u201d? Yeah, do that, but double attention, fat cuts are prone to infections like a rebelious woman during the salem witch trials.\n\n\n* Part 4: Infection symptoms\n\n**Infections are big deal, my dudes.** Do you realize you are essentially opening up your biggest organ (skin) and letting bacteria, viruses, disease get in? Your body is like \u201cthe fuck is this?\u201d **You can get serious shit from using non-sterile tools or metal, get your back acrhced to death with tetanus, or get blood poisoning ect.** Don\u2019t go \u201ceh, if i get fucked up then i\u2019ll go to the hospital\u201d shit, you better go before it gets out of control, infections can  be raging fucks in mere hours, if you are someone with a weak immune system, malnourished/underweight or have a condition, those can be fatal. If you don\u2019t get it treated quick you may end up developing sepsis &amp;amp; go into septic shock. \n\n* **symptoms of an infections:-**\n\n1. Expanding redness around the wound\n\n2. Inflammation or swelling of the wound\n\n3. Wound is warm or hot to touch\n\n4. Cloudy, yellow-ish or green-ish pus drainage with a stinky odor. \n\n5. Pain, tenderness or sensitivity \n\n6. **Fever**\n\nIf you got a fever, no shadow of a doubt you got yourself an infection! And it\u2019s spreading in your body, medical attention here isn\u2019t an option! Get a doctor working on it ASAP.\n\n**Note:** you can treat early-stage infections at home, use [fusidic acid 2%](https://www.globalpharmacyplus.com/fusidin-cream-fusidic-acid-2-20mg-brand-name) apply every 18-24 hours. If the infection is still there for a week or progressing, Say hello to the nurse. \n\n* **Part 5: Types of Bandages &amp;amp; uses**\n\nFirst things first, **Do not use toilet paper/napkins as bandages, ever** this whole point of a bandage is to keep debris away from the wound, **the rule of being a useful bandage is to not use any weak easily breakable material, or dissolvable** i use napkins &amp;amp; duct tape as a bandage, let\u2019s just say i spent some time on the hospital bed more than i expected from \u201ckeeping my cut safe\u201d shit can break &amp;amp; dry up inside and you need to get a surgery to have it removed. \n\nNow that we got that outta the way, There are many types of bandages for different purposes &amp;amp; differents kinda injuries, but we are talking about treatings cuts and gashes, although there many common types of self harm methods, like burning and such, i\u2019m gonna stick to cuts. (If you want me to make another guise for different methods, please do say so)\n\nThere are 4 main types of bandages:-\n1. Gauze\n2. Compression\n3. Tubular \n4. Plasters\n\n(1) Gauze is preferably used as the main bandage to cover your cuts with, since it lets air out and not trap moist inside, micro-guys love a warm, moist spot, that\u2019s hawaii for them. But moist is good for healing, however if there was bacteria trapped in, you\u2019re gonna have a goof. But it\u2019s also highly-absorbmemt and great for all that bleeding and shit.\n\nMain bandage to use a cover should be gauze, you can use [non-stick gauze pads](https://www.amazon.com/Band-Aid-Brand-Large-Scrapes-Inches/dp/B00LITXR52) and secure them with adhesive tapes, such as [medical](https://www.amazon.com/Transpore-Medical-Tape-Clear-Plastic/dp/B000C4OHXA) tape, [paper](https://www.ellenhutson.com/3m-micropore-paper-tape-2-pk/) tape, or [surgical](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_tape) tape. \n\nBut you can rebel and use [adhesive gauze pads](https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/walgreens-bordered-gauze-adhesive-pads-4x4-inch/ID=prod6216503-product) :p im not your mother.\n\n(2) compression bandages are used to apply pressure to the limb, reduce blood flow &amp;amp; control bleeding, if you nicked or cut a vein or a small artery (get a doctor) but if not, get a clean cotton towel, apply pressure to the bleeding for 15 minutes (no peaking!) and check, if it\u2019s still bleeding apply pressure again, if it wont stop bleeding, well, you know where your next destination will be.\n\nAfter applying the main bandage/[cosmopor bandage](https://www.ebay.co.uk/p/Cosmopor-E-10cm-X-8cm-Sterile-First-Aid-Absorbent-Adhesive-Wound-Dressing-25-Pcs/1805471365) you then apply an outer compression bandage, there are two types:- \n1. **Long stretch:** highly compressive and easily adjusted, but the have high resting pressure, must be removed at night or if in a resting position for long.\n\n2. **Short stretch:** safe &amp;amp; comfortablw for long-term use, even in resting position.\n\nThere are [elastic compression bandages](https://www.amazon.com/Elastic-Bandage-Wrap-Compression-Tape/dp/B06XQ8B8Y8) &amp;amp; [cotton compression bandages](https://m.made-in-china.com/product/100-Cotton-Elastic-Compression-Bandage-A101-730827892.html) when applying a compression bandage, you must distribute even neat pressure, not one loose roll and the next one super tight to \u201ceven it out\u201d. \n\n**Note:** be careful when applying compressions, too much pressure can be very damaging! It can stop blood circulation or if you have prolonged use of compression on the same limb day after day can change the shape of your limb/muscle! \n\n(3) Tubular is pretty self explanatory, instead of using a roll of bandage you juse use a tube, those are outer bandage, just like compression, usually it\u2019s for folks who are allergic to latex/silicone in most bandages or adhesives. \n\n(4) Plaster are 2-in-1, they have the bandage &amp;amp; the adhesive ready, those are nice as hell, but also fucking unecessarily expensive for it, [composor bandages](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Cosmopor-Adhesive-Dressing-4-X-4-Inch-Nonwoven-Square-White-Sterile-1-Count/836689332) are nice and soft, [Band-aids](https://www.amazon.com/Gamago-Bandages-Bob-Ross-Pound/dp/B07D7Y37ND) and many other different shapes, sizes and colors, plasters have it all.\n\n**note:** i mean, i should maybe consider wound dressings as a bandage, but yeah, there\u2019s that. They can be use to help blood from sticking to bandage &amp;amp; keep debris away. \n\n* **Part 6: Allergic Folks**\n\nThis one is for allergic ones, the people who can\u2019t use common bandages that contain latex or silicone or adhesives.\n\nIf you have an allergy of adhesives or latex, you may get a rash (red, itchy skin) after taking off the adhesive OR if you have a latex allergy, because some bandages &amp;amp; adhesives contain latex.\n\nYou may have an allergy to those if Take off the adhesive after hours and see redness at the site, or erosions, vesicles, crusts, and scaling. You should avoid exposing yourself to your allergies because everytime you do, the servere the reaction will be.\n\n**Here\u2019s the alternatives instead:-**\n\n\u2022 use hypoallergenic tape, such as [Surgical cloth tape](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/all-3m-products/~/3M-Medipore-Soft-Cloth-Surgical-Tape/?N=5002385+3293321963&amp;amp;rt=rud) or [hypoallergenic paper tape](https://www.shopwoundcare.com/p-a3m-micropore-surgical-white-paper-tape.html)\n\n\u2022 use [Skin preparation barrier films](https://www.exmed.net/blog/ostomyhelp/post/2015/09/28/skin-preps-and-ostomy.aspx), you apply  this on your skin, (sprays, wipes) as a protective layer between the skin and advesive, **do not apply it on the wound or face** if you feel burning or stinging you may have got that inside the wound. \n\n\u2022 Skin preparation barrier films can easily be washed off with water &amp;amp; soap, or by a protective barrier removal product.\n\n**when taping isn\u2019t an option:-**\n\n\u2022 for the extreme reactionists, apply [Gauze Padding](https://www.mdsupplies.com/medical-supplies-Dukal-Gauze-Pad-4x4-12-ply-Sterile-3HG26SECEB.html) with [Fluff Gauze Rolls](https://www.tcr-online.com/product-p/fir-45416.htm) to roll it into place.\n\n\u2022 for wounds on you can\u2019t roll, use gauze padding with [abdominal padding](http://devinemedical.shopgate.com/item/313535363230) then use a [Band Netting](https://www.xingyuanmed.com/elastic-sanitary-net-p18.html) to hold it in place.\n\n\n* **Part 7: Your Tools.**\n\nThe tools you use must be fresh new, don\u2019t pick up a tool you found on the ground or any tool you don\u2019t know the history of it, where it came from or what it touched, you never know if some special micro-dudes are sitting in it; waiting for you, carrying a gift for you ;)\n(The gifts are:- Tetanus, Serious infections, blood poisoning, blood diseases, Hiv, viruses, transmittable disease ect. Ect.)\n\n1. always use sterilized, fresh new tools.\n\n2. Dispose of said tool after 3-5 uses or if you haven\u2019t used it in a long time\n\n3. Disinfect tools before &amp;amp; after use.\n\n4. ALWAYS keep tools in dry place away from humid &amp;amp; water!\n\n5. store tools in a [Sterile paper package](https://m.globalsources.com/si/AS/Anqing-Kangjie/6008846494519/pdtl/Nail-salon-sterile-autoclave-packaging-bag-1.medical-paper-+CPP-PET-Film-2.strong-sterile-barrier/1118300349.htm) or a clean cloth, then hide in a clean containter.\n\n6. **Safely dispose of tools!** when disposing of tools, place them in a strong closed container! You don\u2019t want leave sharp blades in a plastic bag &amp;amp; end up hurting the garbage men!\n\nAlso, keep everything sterilized when you\u2019re working on your lesions, before starting a session wash your hands with antiseptic soap or non-fragmented soap, [wash it good like a hobby-surgeon](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.icliniq.com/articles/healthy-living-wellness-and-prevention/hand-washing-steps%3famp=1) if available use sterilized gloves, make sure the area/table you\u2019re working on is sterilized with rubbing alcohol along with the tools, use a Q-tip or wooden tongue depressors to apply antibiotic creams/ointments, don\u2019t use your bare fingers, who know\u2019s what\u2019s sitting under your fingernails?\n\n**Note:** **Do Not use glass as a tool** Glass can break inside leaving small pieces that can get seriously infected, or you end up healing close with a piece of glass inside you, you know when a splinter in your hand moves? Same thing, it can move with your blood and travel inside, it\u2019s\nAlso extremely painful if you apply pressure to it, you\u2019ll end up need a surgery to remove it.\n\n* **Part 8: Tips &amp; Tricks**\n\nThis one is just general things you should know, you can tie them to the things written above.\n\n1. **Never pick your scabs!** it\u2019s like a mini-shield your blood clots are proudly showing off to you, going all like \u201cyour safe, body!\u201d Only for to pick it off, dude, be nice to your cells! When you pick off a scab you starting at square one of the healing process, and making it harder to get a better scab back.\n\n2. **Keep everything sterilized and clean** including your hands before starting a session, wash your hands with non-fragrance soap or antiseptic soap, the table you work on/touch should also be cleaned up with rubbing alcohol along with your tools, such as scissors to cut bandages &amp;amp; self harm tool.\n\n3. If you dont have a wound dressing, you can use plenty of antibiotic cream/ointment to help stop the scab/blood from sticking to your bandage.\n\n4. **if your bandage is stuck inside a cut** soak it in warm water or saline solution for 5-10 minutes, gently pull, it should be mostly pain free, if its still stuck, soak again. Or you can shower with the bandage on.\n\n5. **you should get a deep cut stitched in under 12 hours** after that, don\u2019t bother. as the healing already started and you can\u2019t close it, it will take much longer to heal, more prone to infection and will leave a sizable scar.\n\n6. **The Itch(tm)** your cuts can pull a big-dick-move on you, it\u2019ll itch you like hell! But that\u2019s a good sign, it means your injury is healing, even scars that itch are essentially still healing till they fade. \n\n7. For surface cut, after a few days or so, your cuts may get extremely itchy and red around the scabs, but know it\u2019s normal! It\u2019s healing and the itchiness means it\u2019s almost done, basically your body saying \u201cLOOK AT ME, I\u2019m doing a good job!\u201d \n\n8. You can treat itchiness with [itch-relief antibiotic ointment](https://www.amazon.com/Neosporin-Antibiotic-Ointment-Infection-Prevention/dp/B01BGEVWJG) or soothing ointments, such as vicks. \n\n9. If you really gotta itch it, you need to have some sort of fabric or outer bandage on, gently &amp;amp; repeatedly slap the area, gentle slaps okay? Be a gentleman. \n\n10. **If your bandage is not sticking good,** shave the hair around the area to help adhesive stick to it, you can also spray rubbing alcohol to help get of the oils and give you extra grip. \n\n11. **Stay away from high friction, a lot of moving areas** , such as the hips, between the thighs, shoulders and joints, it makes it harder to heal and more painful, also **stay away from dangerous areas** such as the inner thighs, neck, wrists, ankles and feet, those have important arteries, veins and nerves, some also very thin and can easily go \u201cdeep\u201d without intending to.\n\n* **Part 9: What did you nick?**\n\nYou can accidentally sometimes hit veins or small arterioles, or a fucking artery for all we know, if you hit any of them, you must stop the bleeding by applying pressure to it for 15 minutes, no peaking allowed, paco. If if\u2019s still bleeding then apply pressure again. Still bleeding? Yeah no, your next place will at the hospital ASAP.\n\nSo what did you hit?\n1. Vein: Slow steady pulsating bleeding, dark red blood.\n2. Arteriole: squirts when you nick it or hit it, pulsating fast bleeding, bright red blood.\n3. Artery: Squirting blood all the way through. Bright red blood, pulsating with the heart.\n4. Nerves: shockwave of pain as soon as you hit it, long-lasting stabbing pain &amp;amp; pins\u2019n\u2019needles, you may lose control, sensation or function of your limb.\n\nIf you hit an artery or arteriole, those guys need internal stitching and medical care, those are absolutely Dang-O-Rous, dudes. \n\nPlease be nice to your body &amp;amp; limbs, they don\u2019t deserve that, they\u2019re just trying to keep you mobile, independently live and care for yourself. \n\n* **Part 10: Consequences of going deep.**\n\n**Going deep is not glamouris as you think,** you risk cutting veins, causing nerve damage, paralayising your limbs, losing sensation &amp;amp; function. The deeper you go, the worse the chances &amp;amp; measures taken on the infections.\n\n**Even after it fully heals, you\u2019re bound to cut through nerve endings,** causing irreversible nerve damage. you\u2019ll get constant, life-lasting pins &amp;amp; needles pain, or sharp shocking stabbing pain in the raised, hard, tight scar of the cut, it messes with your movements &amp;amp; the tightness pulls you skin. (Which is painful)\n\nApplying pressure on it hurts &amp;amp; stops you from working, moving it hurts, stretching it hurts worse. **sometimes you get this pain for absolutely no reason at random times,** in a middle of conversations, making weird faces, flinching and all.\n\n**You\u2019ll lose alot of blood if you cut everyday,** if you lose more than 20% of your blood/fluid supply it\u2019ll cause alot of complications. You can sometimes still bleed underneath skin, causing a bruise around the cut. Bloodloss can cause organ damage, light-headedness, weakness/fatigue, nausea, dizziness, weak breathing and feeling cold along with low blood pressure and disturbing heart rhythm, electrolyte imbalances, anemia blah, blah blah, ect. Ect. Ect. And much more.\n\nPlus, caring for deep cuts takes a looong time, and alot of money on supplies, even worse if you get to a (american) hospital with a sky-rocket of a bill.\n\n**You also risk your social statues,** i know, i know, fuck all of these people who treat you differently just because of some old scars, fuck them beyond and above, but what can you do? This is how the world works, you must socialize with other people, to get jobs, make relationships/friends, getting your basic needs, you need to deal with people, and **those people can ruin your social statues if they see your scars,** either by spreading rumors, calling the cops on you (thinking you may hurt others) or an ambulance to get you to a psych ward (thinking they\u2019re heroes) or simply eyeballing you all the time, or approaching you acting all nice (which is fake, they just wanna feel superiorly good) \n\nIn summary, **imagine as many ways as possible people can fuck with you because of your scars.** They\u2019ll treat you differently than others, they single you out of the group for the hell of it.\n\n**Average people cannot fathom why someone would ever hurt themselves intentionally,** they just can\u2019t relate; so they think you\u2019re an aggressive maniac. **So they\u2019ll stop you from getting into jobs interviews,** getting disqualified from the military as soon as they see your scars, people being scared of you and isolating you from others by talking about you. \n\n**Is it worth it?** Really? This coping mechanism is worth all of these trouble of bandaging, wasting money, hiding, lying, wearing long sleeves in the heat of the summer, not being able to go swimming, not being able to show your scars without getting in some sort of trouble and avoiding being intimate for this? \n\n**Scars will take years to go, sometimes decades if you don\u2019t take care of them with scar removal treatments.** they\u2019ll soften, flatten, and fade but the pins \u2018n\u2019 needles pain will still stay. \n\n**so, is it worth it? It\u2019s up to you to decide.**\n\n\nLook after yourselves, my dudes.\n\n\u2022 **Part 11: Validation &amp;amp; Jealousy**\n\n**There\u2019s no such thing as being a pussy for not harming your self severely,** what are you trying to prove? Are you trying to display just how bad your mental state is by going deep? Is it because you\u2019re jealous that other people are \u201cbrave\u201d for cutting deep? Is it because you want your self harm to be \u201csevere enough\u201d to be validated as a serious problem; in return people take you seriously?\n\n**Any reason, with any method to self harm is valid, meaning your mental suffering is real, and you deserve professional treament no matter how deep or how severe the injuries you inflict.**\n\n**This is the thing with self-harm &amp;amp; eating disorders, they are highly competitive** once you realize how much damage the human body can take, your mental illness in a sick twisted way thrives &amp;amp; challenges you to that degree; To see how much you fuck up your body and stay alive.\n\nYou\u2019re only going downhill from here, the people who you may consider \u201cbrave\u201d for going deep also have had the same feelings of **\u201cnot good enough\u201d** **\u201dnot bad enough\u201d** **\u201dnot valid enough\u201d** , just because you are doing cat scratches/surface cuts doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re less deserving of treatment! This is a good place to start treatment before it becomes much harder to solve, or may be too late to be fixed, do be going all **\u201ci\u2019ll get treatment once i reach my full potentional\u201d**\n\nmy dudes, **you\u2019re testing the waters everytime,** accidental suicides are a thing commonly known in self-harm, sometimes you may end up passing out while bleeding and there may not be someone who could help.  it\u2019s not as glamorous as you think, the aftermath of going deep is not talked about more, that\u2019s another wall of text i\u2019d have to write just so you know how fucked up it is, self-harmers don\u2019t realize how much they normalize this very wrong behaviour, it\u2019s just your brain trying to not make you feel \u201cwrong\u201d or \u201codd\u201d, when it\u2019s fucked.\n\n**Bottom line, your feelings of \u201cnot good enough\u201d are not uncommon, you are valid for feeling this way, it\u2019s the mental illness wanting to push you deep into this rabbit hole. you have a serious problem that deserves professionals treatment and half-ass essential oils remedies, cutting deep is not pretty nor is it an achievment or something to \u201cprove\u201d your sickness.\u201d**\n\nEdited: part 11 added, fixed a few things + new tips &amp; tricks.", "subreddit": "MadeOfStyrofoam"}

It's escalated slightly each time, I guess because I've gotten less afraid of it or something.\n\nUp until yesterday it was restricted to nighttime, when I was alone with my thoughts and the weird morbid mood struck me. Yesterday, in the middle of the afternoon, I was feeling fine. I'd been having a good day even, getting ready for an evening with friends, watching some dumb youtube and, and I sort of just got up and started at it, going way further than I had when I was actually feeling bad. I wasn't really feeling anything as I did it. I almost felt kind of proud while I looked at the aftermath and then a bit later felt like an idiot because I was going to have to see people a few hours after and come up with some kind of reasonable outfit that'd cover it up despite it being 90 degrees out.

{"post_id": "crq8b0", "created_utc": 1566067824, "title": "I Forgot Recovery Sucks", "author": "arsixx", "self_text": "I've struggled with self-harm since I was 11 years old. I'm currently 21.   \n\n\nI remember the first time I hurt myself I actually carved some heart in my arm because of some pathetic break-up, which I know now was really really stupid. But that's the single action it took to struggle with self-harm for so long - regardless of how pathetic it might seem in present day. It wasn't just a break-up that shook me, either. There was an immense amount of confusion, heart-break, and hurt happening in my family which is what truly rolled the ball even further. \n\n  \nIn middle school, it of course started to get out of hand worse than any time before. I would hurt myself nearly every single day to just feel something other than nothing or to counteract the heavy burden I felt on my chest daily. I wrapped my scars in a bandanna on my wrist, of course being obvious without even realizing it. The burden you might ask, was probably self-inflicted - I had to take care of my siblings, put on a fake smile daily, and live with people who never uttered a single \"I love you\" during my whole childhood.   \n\n\nFor a hot minute, things got much better during my last year of middle school because I got to finally live with my father and step mom, who I was not allowed to see for many years before then thanks to my mom and grandmother. But all good things come to an end, and I had to leave sooner than anticipated. Things got even worse - I was genuinely spiraling out of control.   \n\n\nAfter a year or so, in high-school, things began to get better. I went to physical HS for two out of four years and graduated through an online K12 program, which really helped. The amount of times I hurt myself in high-school is significantly less than middle school and before. But there are many points in HS where I can recall when I hurt myself and why. I feel as though I mainly began to stop because I was tired of hiding my scars/cuts. I was tired of being the burden on everyone else when I was not feeling top notch. Thus, I mainly quit for the most part.  \n\n\nI thought I was done with it. I thought it was over.   \nI obviously always get urges - after you have self harmed for so long, it's much harder to get rid of the urges even when you haven't done it in forever. But I genuinely, for the most part, held strong and didn't pick up a blade.   \nMy friends told me to get rid of the old blades I have kept for almost 10 years, but I never had the courage to do so because *what if* I wanted to hurt myself again? I never touched them after the last time I used them, but they currently still are hidden in my dresser. It's almost like a trophy of my past...  \n\n\nBut clearly it isn't over; I hurt myself for the first time in years three weeks ago. Ever since I slashed my arms recently, the urges just won't go away. I've punched my door countless times (it's a solid oak door - it won't break, so no, my door does not have a million holes in it LOL) and I've been spending my days/nights with my boyfriend just so I can't hurt myself. Even with him there, which does help, I can't stop crying about the most mundane and stupid things. I feel bad for him because I can't even tell him what's wrong because I don't even know myself. He just hopelessly sits in silence with me hoping that he could help more than he can.

I was good at handling my emotions, I got a new job, and even changed my degree so I could finally focus on something that I enjoy. I was happy being alone, and I was happy being with friends. I didn't feel a need to have to be supervised every night just so I don't hurt myself.   \n\n\nJust one thing changed everything else, and now I feel as though I have been catapulted back into my past body and experiences. I just don't know what to do anymore, and although I have hope that I can recover again, it really is the biggest pain in the world.   \n\n\nI thought I was over it - but I guess it was just a lot of built up stuff over a long time that made me blow.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I recently had my first ever anxiety/panic attack and yesterday night i almost had one again. I was also feeling unhappy for no reason. All the usual \"self hate\" thoughts were also on my mind.\n\nBefore i go into my SH trigger, i need to tell you all a little story. I worked in retail for round half a year at a certain outlet. I became friends with a colleague there. That certain colleague has a lot of family issues and i knew that she hadn't been eating for a few days. So i loaned her $50 out of my own will and told her to use it for her meals. And i never asked for the money back.\n\nFast forward a few months, we both left the company. We didn't really talk. A few weeks later, she messaged me asking for more money. And of course, being the soft hearted idiot i am, i loaned her more. This happened every few weeks. And now she owes me $2K. It's not a lot of money, but as a young adult trying to get into college, to me, it is. \n\nSo today, i went to check my bank balance and i discovered it was at roughly $30. My next pay is at the end of the month and i have to pay for my own meals and shit. So i went to ask her if i could have just $200 back just to tide me to the end of the month. Guess what? She said that she didn't have the amount, and when i pushed her, she just vaguely told me that she'll \"give it back when she could depending on how her work schedule was like\".\n\nI was pissed, and i'm still pissed now. Added to everything in the first paragraph, this leads me to my first SH in a week. But mainly i'm more stressed about how i'm going to hang on till the end of the month. So anyway yeah. This isn't really a post about self harm. But it's just  mini rant because i need to get it off my chest. Thanks for reading.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I wasn't numb anymore, I wasnt sad anymore, I was calm. Hearing the ambient noises of my grandmother cooking and the air vent humming while laying cold on the bathroom floor... I haven't felt such relief in a very long time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nim scared about this... im scared that, thats the only spiritual relief that i have received, ever. i have temptation to just cut myself over stupid reasons, so i can get that rush again. it feels like a drug addiction that i have to suppress honestly. the worst part about it is i feel proud that i did it. i feel proud that i can walk around in pain and have a visible representation of that pain. like i do worry that someone might see it and think im a freak but at the same time i dont. i want others to feel my pain because everyone around me seems like they are hiding their pain and im done with that. i just want to destroy myself. i dont feel like i deserve life, i feel that i deserve death. and i hope i do receive that in my 20s.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

This probably isn\u2019t going to make a lot of sense, but I need to say it anyway.\n\n\nSomeone very close to me suffers from a number of mental health issues, as do I. They had a bad breakdown a few months ago which resulted in them almost ending their life. We live in different countries and can only stay in touch via social media. \n\n\nMy mother is an emotionally abusive individual. I\u2019ve had bad breakdowns, physical and mental, just from being in the same room as her. I\u2019m normally on the phone with the person I\u2019m close to, late at night in my time zone, to prevent them from hurting themself. But because of my mother\u2019s abuse, the night the breakdown happened, I was too traumatised to disobey her and didn\u2019t turn my phone on until the following morning. (I only found out about the breakdown afterwards)\n\n\nIt was hellish enough almost losing the only person who\u2019s made me feel truly loved and valued, but then they actually blamed me for not being there for them. It was only in the heat of the moment, but I felt verbally eviscerated all over again. It\u2019s caused a serious rift in our friendship. \n\n\nToday, they admitted to me that they hate life now, and that I contributed to making them feel that way. I waited until that call ended, then I went into the bathroom, got some scissors and began cutting my legs. One of those cuts drew blood. I\u2019ve never cut myself that hard before. \n\n\nWhat hurts the most is that when I first met this person, I was their saviour and helped them love life again. I can\u2019t live with myself knowing I\u2019ve become my worst nightmare. So I tied my dressing gown belt around my neck and tried to strangle myself. But my basic survival instincts made me stop and remove it. Now I\u2019m just shaking and crying and full of regret. \n\n\nI\u2019ve never harmed myself so bad before, but I deserve it. I ruined someone\u2019s life and inflicted so much torture on them that I deserve as much pain as what I put them through. If I weren\u2019t so shaky right now, I\u2019d cut myself again.\n\n\nI can\u2019t call any hotlines because my mother will hear the call and make me end it. I tried signing up for BetterHelp but was straight up told via email that my issues weren\u2019t serious enough to qualify for it. Because I\u2019m both physically and mentally disabled I\u2019m unable to reach out to anyone without my mother finding out. \n\n\nI just want to cut until I bleed out.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

She came to me, fretting about how she did something so stupid. I asked her about it, and she admitted that she had scratched herself deep enough to bleed, multiple times.

But anyways ! \n\nI have often been obsessed with hiding my scars or make them as white as possible as soon as possible. The scars stay purple for a very long time and it's frustrating, because your friends and family will notice your relapses. Here are the things I do to help speed up the scaring process and make the scar look better in the end.\n\nFirst of all, always disinfect properly, and let the open wound heal itself with no bandage or band-aid over it (it needs a lot of oxygen to \"close\" the skin back together). Wear long sleeves, preferably cotton for the first 2 or 3 days.\n\nOnce the wound makes a dry crust, you can start treating it with propolis balm or a self-made balm. You can find propolis balm in organic shops. I make my own balm, here's the recipe : \n\n* *1 teaspoon of shea butter*\n* *1 teaspoon of coconut oil*\n* *1/2 teaspoon of bees wax (pure)*\n* *2 drops of wheat germs oil*\n* *1/2 teaspoon of honey*\n\n*Make it melt in a water-bath (\"bain-marie\" don't know how to translate that). You can add 2-3 drops of your favorite essential oil (but not too much because it might make the mix too oily / liquid). Then put the mix in a little container. The recipe is for 10ml so I usually make 2 little containers of 5ml each. Don't hesitate on putting as much balm as you can on your crust during the day, it hydrates the skin and if it doesn't speed up the healing process that much, it will truly help make the scar look better in the end.*\n\nOnce the crust is gone, and you are left with purple skin, go to your doctor and ask for a cortisone-based cream. He will understand, it's often used to whiten scars, instead of lasers which are too expensive. Be sure to apply it twice a day, and not expose that part of your skin to the sun (otherwise you might end up with a big white spot all around your scar). Let it heal, it make take a few weeks, but trust me, it speeds up the whitening. I've did it on both my thighs and am not ashamed anymore to go to the swimming pool, they're barely noticeable.\n\nI hope this post can help some people who are recovering from self harm or who wish to recover, treat their scars correctly.

This usually occurs when I\u2019m driving for a long time or have my arms in a certain position for too long.

I usually just stand up or place my arms in a way that allows blood flow but is there anything I can do to make it go away quicker?

I guess in the dark he never saw my scars.\n\nAt some point we were at the locker room of the club picking up our jackets and there was enough light so he saw my scars. He asked about it and I was honest. From that point on he went no contact. I tried to plan another date but I had a very cold answer that \"he was seeing someone else and it was not a good time\". That was three months ago or so.\n\nOn Monday he came back asking if we could go out for a drink. I had a rough day at work and it seemed weird so I said no. I asked \"you want sex right ?\" and he said \"yes\" with a laughing smiley face. I sometimes have no commitment sex with friends or people I meet at parties, it's not an issue. But this, it was just humiliating. It took me two days to answer, but I said I would not have sex with him again after he ghosted me because of my scars. He made me feel awful about my body and my past and even if it was just fun, \"no strings attached\" sex, I would never let him touch my body again.\n\nYou don't have to be in love to have good fun sex with someone, but at least be a nice person to them, and be respectful of their bodies. That's the bare minimum.\n\nHe instantly answered with 4 voicemails that I didn't listen to because I'm too scared he might humiliate me even more. Two hours later he sent another voicemail. I feel awful and humiliated.\n\nUPDATE 4 HOURS LATER : I talked about this with a common friend of ours and he immediately stopped me right there. He explained to me that this guy I had been dating had gone through a massive depression and psychotic episodes this last year, and was just out of the psych ward when I first met him. That's why he got so freacking scared at the sight of my scars.\n\nAfter hearing this from my friend, I decided to listen to the voicemails, and the guy actually apologized for making me feel bad about my body and scars, but that was not his intent at all. He had been focusing on himself (and his depression I guess) for a long while and he didn't realize the timing was off when he came back to me. He said I was a very intriguing, smart and beautiful woman, and that, under other circumstances, he would have opened his heart to me. But it wasn't the right time.\n\nI answered we were both going through a tough year, that I was very susceptible about my scars, so we had different needs at different moments. We concluded on seeing each other around and stay friends, and I think it eventually brought us closer together, even if we're not planning on dating again anytime soon.\n\n So I guess everything is fine now. Mental health can be tricky... it's  such a taboo, neither of us were able to talk openly about it and we  ended up hurting each other's feelings.

Grab your own knife. Control the pain. Visibly see and experience it with full understanding. \nIt seems strange that in ones own existence such thoughts of hurting ones self, damaging the one skin we have, in this one life we live is possible. How is it we have created a world where so many people are in so much internal pain they are trying to get out of it, but often too scared to take that step?\nI\u2019ve spent nights pulling out my hair in sobs, pleading with myself to make such thoughts of my life ending go away.

The fear of the darkness that seeps into every corner of your brain willing you to push further into the darkness and submit completely. \nThe guilt for feeling as if you failed at life.

They don\u2019t deserve the pain of feeling like they aren\u2019t enough when your own pain, which you cannot even understand is too much.\nWhen a small taste of what life used to be like trickles in, a wave of sadness washes over. That reminder of what joy was and what you once were makes you confused and frustrated that you cannot find a way to feel those feelings truly again.

Together it\u2019s a whole new kinda fucked up. \n\nI started self harming at 11 to cope with these feelings that I didn\u2019t yet have a name for, and the suicidal thoughts they caused. I got a mirena at 17 and my cycle mostly disappeared, or came very lightly every now and then for like a day, which is why at 18 I had started to try and quit doing this. \n\nBut it came back last night while I was at work (I work overnights so it was actually like, 3 am but whatever). I kinda audibly flipped shit in the men\u2019s room. Then I went back to my desk and flipped shit there quietly, to myself. Then I went home a few hours later. At that point I was so ungrounded and intensely dysphoric that I just couldn\u2019t think of anything else to do to help myself besides hurting myself or... super spooky scary.... reaching out. \n\nReaching out has always been incredibly difficult for me because, like I said... bad home. I felt like a bother my whole childhood and it\u2019s damaged me in adulthood. I can\u2019t reach out to friends because I\u2019m terrified they a)are bothered by me b)don\u2019t care and c)will tell me or indirectly make it clear they don\u2019t care and/or I am a bother. Or, worst of all, they\u2019ll actually give a fuck and worry about me. I fucking hate it when people worry about me. So I was not about to go tell someone I wanted to hurt myself. \n\nSo I just kind of have resigned myself today to that being the coping mechanism I\u2019m just gonna have to use. I\u2019ve been back 2 times since the first and I\u2019m definitely making the wrong choice, but who gives a fuck? Maybe tomorrow will be different. Maybe it won\u2019t. Who knows. \n\nI\u2019m just fucking mad at myself right now. Mad I did it, mad I couldn\u2019t bring myself to reach out, mad that the triggering event happened in the first place, just mad mad mad.  \n\nI\u2019m mainly just venting here. I can\u2019t really tell anybody I know about it. For one, I feel fucking ashamed of it. For another, I don\u2019t see what good hitting up my friends like \u201chey guys I got so fucking depressed and dysphoric today that I started cutting again\u201d after the fact is gonna do. But the knowledge that I did it and the guilt associated are eating me alive.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Why hurt yourself. That's saying jumping off a cliff will make me happy if I hit my head\n\nMe: when I'm 18 I'll be jumping out of airplanes so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f  [new message] You dont understand so you cant sit around and judge someone over something you have no understanding of\n\nHim: I dont have to understand but whose life can be so bad that they can willingly cut themselves for pleasure.

The only people I could think that have legitimate reason to do anything to themselves is mentally disabled people. Your a teenage girl fully fine cutting yourself. Why?. Your life cannot be that bad.\n\n[I then proceeded to get very irritated by this display of true ignorance and invalidation and told him I would no longer continue that conversation, which he got mad at and said that what he said is the truth and that's what I do if I dont like what someone has to say and that's cut them off. Which irritated me even more. He even went so far as to say I was playing the victim when I started asking him basic questions about myself to which he had no answers for. This was to communicate that he knew zero about me and did not have my trust and respect enough for me to even consider his ignorance.]\n\nI also want to say that hell yes the dude does do crazy shit.

I had a lot of conflicting emotions, and felt depressed for a few months (it wasn\u2019t ever diagnosed, and I am definitely not trying to say I was). That was the first time I considered self harm. The wanting to goes on and off, there will be months between urges. But when I have an urge, it stays for a while.\n\nI feel anxious a lot, I bite my nails and pick at my lips until bleeding. It\u2019s partially from anxiety feelings, partially from boredom half the time. I don\u2019t usually get an urge to cut though, unless something happens to make me really mad or upset. But even after the upset/ anger, it lingers a bit. \n\nI had a breakdown 2 days ago because of a conflict with my mom. It was the third time i\u2019ve had an urge to do it, second worst of the three. When I really want to cut I will find that I pinch, bite, or scratch (pretty ineffective because of my nails from biting them) around my wrists or arms. It\u2019s never anything to leave a mark longer than half an hour at most, but I was sifting through this for a while and I saw a lot of people saying that this counts as self harm. \n\nI know I shouldn\u2019t do it, and I should stop but when I did it a few days ago it felt... good?

My life is actually pretty good right now but I just can't shake these feelings of self hatred and depression. I feel worse than I ever have in my life, but I don't know why. I just feel so lonely. It's just so fucking confusing and frightening that I keep doing this. I started cutting like 3 weeks ago, even though I have been thinking about it for months. Yesterday I just completely broke down and totally sliced up my thighs. I'm scared because my cuts are only a few inches above my shorts hemline, and I keep accidentally letting my shorts come up, exposing my cuts, no one has seen them yet, but I've had several close calls. I know many of you will probably suggest wearing long pants, but that's out of the question because I'm in the middle of a California summer, and I've always been the guy who wears shorts religiously, so much so that people are surprised when I wear long pants. And to top it off, I now am on vacation with my family, one of the the things we're doing is going to the ocean, and I have always loved swimming, so it will look really weird if I don't swim. I'm afraid that someone will see them if my swim shorts come up. I've tried to stop but I just can't. I have no one to talk to in my family, and I'm homeschooled so I don't have many friends. I'm afraid if I tell my parents they'll flip out, my sister used to cut, and my Mom treated her really different after she found out. I honestly don't know why I cut, I just know I need to.

I\u2019ve gotten a few gems from there.\n\nI say this because I\u2019ve finally begun to wear spaghetti strap shirts, despite my scars, thanks to mesh shirts.

Some of them are bright pink and sunken a little so I know those will turn into keloids.\n\nIt\u2019ll take months for it to lose its color. I can\u2019t even wear my favorite mesh shirt (I just made a post here about that) that I\u2019ve recently gotten to reward myself for my progress.

And it\u2019s my own fucking fault for telling him he could, but I just want him to be happy. I always just go with what he wants so he\u2019ll be happy. I\u2019ve sacrificed so much and done so many things I didn\u2019t want to just to make him happy. Maybe if I wasn\u2019t so fucking ugly and stupid he would\u2019ve stayed here with me instead. He told me he wanted to go because when he doesn\u2019t go to games he gets fomo. Little does he know every time he leaves me here alone I get fomo on being with him. Even when he has to go on 3-4 hour work shifts I just sit here on my phone wishing we were together. I feel so happy just being around him and I wish he felt the same but obviously he doesn\u2019t. And it\u2019s late right now and I know he\u2019s in a tent snuggled up with his best friend that he\u2019s clearly falling for, because my stupid fucking ass told him snuggling with friends is fine with me. I fucking hate the thought of her in his arms and I know he\u2019s falling in love with her. I don\u2019t even wanna be at his house anymore, I\u2019d rather be at home because at least I can cut there. I feel so fucking alone right now but I can\u2019t reach out to anyone or they\u2019ll get mad at him for leaving me here, but that\u2019s my fault. All of this is my fault. If I wasn\u2019t so fat and disgusting and full of scars and sad all the time maybe he\u2019d still want to be with me. Maybe if I wasn\u2019t so anxious around people and could go to larp with him he\u2019d like me more than her. I know the only reason he hasn\u2019t left is because she\u2019s still got a boyfriend. Sometimes I just wish she\u2019d break up with her boyfriend and take him from me already. She\u2019s better for him than I am; they already act so much like a couple that people probably think they are, she\u2019s not too fucking stupid and anxious to go to larp with him, and she lives nearby instead of 5 hours away like I do. I\u2019d be fine with him breaking up with me if that would make him happy. I wish I was good enough for him but I\u2019m not.

I'm told to get help, but I don't know how.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Just one cut this time\" well that's a lie. I want to hurt, but I want relief. I've run out of room, I find somewhere else. The cuts are getting deeper, the blood getting redder. The pain getting duller, the lies getting better.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What happened there?\" \"It was just the cat.\"\u00a0\n\"What about there?\" \"I was trimming the bush.\"\nI've learned how to lie, I've learned the excuses. I've learned how to hide pain, learned to hide tears. I pull down my sleeves, I don't go swimming. I cringe when I hear 'razor', and cry when I see one.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I hate the blade, but at the same time I love it.\u00a0\nI hate being alone, but you know I want it. My friends say they love me, but I wonder why. They tell me they'll be there, but I know that's a lie. \"I guess I'll just die.\" They say with a smile. I laugh at their jokes, but inside i fail to find the hilarity.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You should smile more.\" I wish I could. maybe if I  fake it, I might just make it. I've mastered the deception, all I know now are lies. I feel all alone, but I really don't know why. Don't check my history, what you see might just scare you. Suicide methods are my most googled query.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which is better, the rope or the gun? Buildings might be up there at number one. They say razors fail, but I need to try. They say you'll survive an overdose, but how do they know? Will I do it gently, or go out with a bang? Do I want it to be painless or feel pain one last time?\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Should I write a note? Like anyone will care. Don't give a funeral, I'm really not worth it.\u00a0\nDon't waste your time, I know that I'm worthless. Don't say you're sorry, I know that you're not. Don't say you miss me, we only ever fought.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You'll say you had no clue, well let me clue you in. You left me alone, when I was so lonely. I needed a friend, where did you go? My first cut was after you left. I really don't blame you, I'd leave me too. You may be there physically, but I can't seem to find you. Whatever happened to the parental help?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Band-Aids may help with the cuts on my body, but the wounds of the soul are not so quick to heal. Why do I cut? That's a funny question, I guess addiction would be the right answer. Watching the dark blood drip down my legs, somehow makes all the pain go away. It's a temporary fix, but at least it works.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I'm going swimming now, I hope no one sees the evidence of my pain. The salt water stings, but I've felt worse. I'll just grind my teeth and plaster a smile on my face. \"I'm fine\" is my response, what a wonderful lie.

I still feel like I miss her and will always miss her. She said she couldn\u2019t be friends but could talk to me every so often. She said we\u2019re very different people but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really true.\n\nEdit 2: it\u2019s the morning after and I think I feel a little bit better. Though I wish I could talk to her without feeling guilty now. I wanted to text her today but I think that would be too much right now. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m going to do next.\n\nEdit 3: I want to talk to Paula so badly again but she has already told me she doesn\u2019t want to be friends.

I had a massive dysphoric episode (I\u2019m trans, and male, and I always have dysphoria, and am always uncomfortable about something, but when it gets so intense I depersonalize, I call it an episode). I\u2019ve had tons of other things go wrong in my life lately, and I just cracked under all that pressure. Self harm is always how I stopped myself from depersonalizing, from a young age. I was 11 when I started. And it was mostly how I dealt with any bad feelings. \n\nBut when I was able to quit, i forgot how hard it was to quit after a while. I forgot how good it felt and how easy it is to deal with shit like this, even if later on it\u2019s a pain in the ass to hide. Now it\u2019s been almost 6 days since my relapse and I\u2019ve been doing it every day to deal with anything negative, whether it\u2019s dysphoria or completely unrelated to my trans-ness. \n\nI don\u2019t wanna talk to my friends about this. We\u2019re all legal adults. We all have our own shit to deal with. I talk to them sometimes when I feel down, but I can\u2019t tell them exactly what I\u2019m thinking about doing or what I\u2019m thinking period most of the time. All I can fucking do is repeatedly text some iteration of \u201cI\u2019m fucking sad\u201d. I don\u2019t want to tell them \u201cI\u2019m separating from my own goddamn body and I need help\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m thinking about self harming\u201d or \u201cMy lungs feel like they\u2019re shrinking while my heart is swelling\u201d because as shitty as it seems, that\u2019s emasculating to me. Blame it on toxic masculinity, say I have toxic masculinity, I don\u2019t care, I know that\u2019s not right and not how it should be and I never encourage other men to block their feelings up like I do, but I just can\u2019t not do it. I have some fucked up mental block against it. I\u2019m extremely insecure about how people see me, I already get misgendered a fuck ton and I know im not cis passing, except *maybe* my voice. I know most of the public sees self harm as a mostly \u201cteenage girl\u201d thing, even if it\u2019s certainly not. And I just can\u2019t get over being viewed with those biased, gendered lenses. I\u2019m safe from it here because obviously you all are going to know it\u2019s not like that. \n\nBut anyways. I forgot how easy of a way it was for me to deal with my feelings and my ever-worsening gender dysphoria. And now I\u2019m kinda stuck. Immediately after the relapse I was like \u201cwow I really can\u2019t do this again I fucked up\u201d, but I just kept doing it. And I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to keep keep doing it. I don\u2019t know if I want to stop it even at this point. \n\nBefore I was out, when I was cutting, I hadn\u2019t come to terms with the fact that I had dysphoria really, up until the last year and a half. And I didn\u2019t register a lot of the events that would trigger me to cut as dysphoria, especially as a younger kid (11-14) when I had no idea what a trans person or dysphoria even were. Therefore, I hadn\u2019t realised that cutting was the easiest way I had to deal with the biggest problem I had. It just seems like such a better (I don\u2019t mean good, I mean more effective) way to deal with shit now. Even if I could stop doing it over things that aren\u2019t dysphoria related, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll be able to keep from doing it when I\u2019m badly dysphoric. Not even depersonalization level dysphoria, but like, any amount I feel could lead to that happening. \n\nlike my other thread in this sub, this is just me venting. if you have advice, feel free to give it, dont feel obligated tho.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

My older sibling used to have a problem with cutting themselves, and everybody thought that was so serious and the worst and really scary. I hit myself, and even though my mom and my older sibling knows about it, they're not... Reacting the same why I feel like they would if I were cutting myself.\n\nMy mom found out cause I had a giant bruise on my thigh. She sorta interrogated me so I told her it was from hitting myself with a hammer, but not to worry about it because I wasn't doing it because I was sad or something like that. She didn't like that I was doing it, but she was just kinda \"don't do it again\" and nothing more. She seems more worried about the reason why I'm doing it rather than that I'm doing it in the first place, and while it means I can get away with it more, it makes me upset that she wasn't too bothered by it. It felt like she was reprimanding me for drawing on the walls rather than fuCKING HITTING MYSELF WITH A HAMMER.\n\nI told my older sibling about the situation, though I forgot why.

I punch myself in the head until I'm dizzy when I'm angry or upset,) so I get that they might not see it as super bad, but if I was cutting myself there would be no argument that it's super bad, no matter why I was doing it. I don't want them to see it as super bad, because then they'd be more frustrated that I'm doing it, but it's really invalidating!

I have heard many stories about why people do it, but I've never met someone who has the same mentality as I do. You see, I never self harmed because I was trying to soothe some emotional distress or because I was externalising my own self hatred. In fact, I don't experience desires to self harm in relation to negative feelings at all. I am much more likely to self harm when I'm happy and energetic than when I'm upset or distressed. \n\nBecause of this, I assumed it wasn't a problem at all. However, I notice that I self harm in relation reckless pleasure-seeking. I have a tendency to do dangerous or unhealthy things to get a kick or to feed my impulses, and I have a theory that the self harm is another one of those tendencies. I wish I could say I had full control over it, but I clearly don't. \n\nI wouldn't say it's an addiction, but I will admit that there is a lot of obsessive behaviour linked to it. At this point, I am always scared of running out of tools to self harm with. I always keep such tools in my wallet and I do not want to go without it. During times when I've been admitted to psychiatric hospitals, I've had to pull pretty elaborate plans to either sneak in tools or to obtain new ones if the ones I tried to bring were found. They quickly catch on to sneaky behaviour so I wasn't even allowed to shave my facial hair towards the end of my last stay. I'm being admitted again next week and I'm worried that I'd be kicked out for breaking the rules, yet I'm not sure I can go that long without self harming. \n\nI don't want to admit to it being an addiction, but other people see my behaviour and how it controls me as much more serious than I do. Despite the desperate behaviour, I can't see myself being emotionally dependent on it. I could probably stop if I wanted to, but I do question why it's so important in my life, and why I find it pleasurable in the first place. \n\nTo summarise: I have a very odd relationship with self harm where I find it to be a pleasurable act. I don't experience it as an addiction or emotional dependency, but I do recognise that my behaviour is obsessive. Now I'm mostly wondering if others have a similar experience with it.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

My heart is racing and there's this tension in my head that needs something explosive to happen so I can distract myself. I want the tension of whatever argument is going on to end. To feel like I'm loved, that regardless of whatever we were fighting about, they would be willing to drop if they saw how much I was suffering from it because they really cared about me. Breaking things feels satisfying, but when I direct it towards myself instead, it works two-fold. The immediacy of \"oh fuck what have I done I need to put my shit aside and deal with this very real pain and injury\". Because I don't cut and I have no balls to really feel pain, not unless it's sudden, not that the consequences don't last. \nI've smashed my arm into a car frame which left a bone bruise for weeks. I've stabbed myself in the arm with an exacto which bled a lot more than I planned for. I've whacked my arm with a bread knife and left  tiny serrated line scars on my arm. Slapped myself on the head and face. Slammed/head-butted walls. Things that can heal. Things that don't scar recognizably. Things that don't really disable.\n\nI always feel like an idiot after. And for a really long time, I slowly worked towards the point of being able to deal with the tension and not get into that frame of mind. Tapering from self injury and risky or uncomfortable situations to destruction of property to screaming to healthy outlets. I was \"clean\" of these episodes for more than a year. I would remind myself of how foolish I felt after. How weak it made me look in the eyes of the people I loved. How damaging and abusive it was to others. But it only took the stress of an injury and surgery and two weeks of immobilization and loss of my regular coping mechanism of exercising to get me right back into that phase. Nothing that drew blood but still, the loss of control made me feel so ashamed. I thought I had made progress. It meant nothing to my animal brain. When I hit that point I reached out to a local therapy association to set up an evaluation. Then the cast came off, I was mobile again, I had hope, and I never followed up.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Themes of self harm and suicide popped up again, as I had to memorize suicide warning signs, symptoms of depression  etc.\n\nI never used self harm as a way to deal with overwhelming stress, and using it to handle emotions was never something I thought of doing.

Anything less isn't nearly as effective.  It really does ring most of the same bells as self-harm: the capsaicin literally fools your face into thinking it's on fire and sets off all of those feel-good chemicals we know and love.\n\nI found it out by accident just because I was starting to get into hot sauces with no thought to self-harm, but man is it good.  My first time with a super-hot I took a small shot straight from the bottle and it left me a) drooling and smiling like an idiot for ~15 minutes as it hurt like a mother, and b) immediately wanting more once it wore off.  It really does have that pain/addictive quality going on.  You do eventually acclimate somewhat and the pain becomes less as you do it, but you definitely still feel it and definitely still get the endorphin rush. I splash that shit on everything now.\n\nJust thought I'd throw this out there because as someone who tried everything from rubber bands to ice cubes, this was waaaaaaaaay better for me because it much more closely mimics the chemical rush and addictive nature.  And it's a pretty healthy outlet that can turn into its own hobby, which in and of itself is a good thing.\n\nDo be prepared for a few weeks of butt boot camp, though lol.  And remember, the more you chew and put your mouth through the pain, the more you're saving your butt later.  Trust.\n\nCurious if any other self-harmers have experience with this and if it did it for you at all or not?

Firstly, I\u2019m a 23 year old female who lives with her parents right now. I\u2019m on my parents insurance but I really don\u2019t want them to know that I\u2019ve gone to therapy. Is it better to pay out of pocket in that case? Would it be extremely expensive? \n\nSecondly, there\u2019s one therapist that I saw and i think I\u2019m really interested in setting up an appointment with her. Should I send an email to her first? If so what should I say? She specializes in PTSD as well as self harm, but I don\u2019t have PTSD and nothing really traumatic in my life has happened. My life is pretty OK/normal on the surface. Can I still go to see her?

I found this subreddit a few days ago, and I've enjoyed seeing all the posts people make. Whether it be sharing funny, sad, or relatable experiences. From what I've seen this community is awesome, and I wanted to thank you all for being here for each other.\n\nTL;DR: I feel like I'm going to relapse after nearly a year of being clean and it's scaring the hell out of me.\n\nMILD TRIGGER WARNING. Now that I'm done with that, I really just need to talk. Around this time last year I was admitted to a mental hospital. I had finally cut deep enough, and wanted to die enough that I almost did. That prompted my family and my therapist to commit me, and honestly it was great. Sure the hospital was weird compared to my normal life, but it really did help. Soon after I got out I met this amazing girl who I'm lucky to call mine. She is a main reason I haven't relapsed up to this point. I have a great support group. A therapist, my mom, my girlfriend, my grandma, and several of my closest buddies. I'm doing fine in school and all is well honestly. Despite those awesome things, I can't stop freaking the fuck out about relapsing. The last time I cut was September 4th, 2018. I'm nearly a year clean, and I so badly want to get there and beyond. Everything is pretty good in my life right now, and I'm still over here being self-destructive a year after I thought I let go of that part of myself. The urge to cut is only getting stronger, and I don't know what the hell I'm going to do. I'm seeing my therapist today, but there's no guarantee that will help. My mind is racing round and round about all the bad shit that will happen if I cut again, and I think that's the main reason I haven't given in yet. But I don't know if I can keep this up, and the thought of what my future may hold terrifies me. What if I'm never able to kick this? That scares me the most. Anyway, I just needed to rant I guess. Have a good day everyone. Thanks for reading.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

My job was basically to put the knives in boxes after they\u2019ve been sharpened, scan them, and put them on a cart. I didn\u2019t even think twice about having to handle sharp objects all day at first, because it\u2019s been over 3 years since I\u2019ve self-harmed (however, I was a pretty severe self-harmer before that) and I\u2019ve been doing mostly well since then (better than I ever have in my life, but still).\n\nThe first two weeks, I really liked that job. The hours were 6 AM to 2:30 PM, so I was always done at a good time, the boss left you alone, and I didn\u2019t have to talk to anybody, which I liked. However, this week, everything changed. They replaced my station buddy with a new guy who\u2019s like 70 years old and has no clue what\u2019s happening, so I essentially had to start doing the job of 2 people, all the while, production ramped up, and my boss started requiring mandatory overtime every day, Saturday shifts, and told us we had to work Labor Day (because we\u2019re behind...). The line was so busy that I was constantly backed up, and I didn\u2019t even have time to use the bathroom until lunch (which was still at 12:00, even though we started at 6 AM). On top of all of that, my coworkers were rude, lazy (every other station except mine is a \u201cgo at your own pace\u201d type deal), and yesterday one of them made a homophobic comment towards me. I became CONSTANTLY stressed out and frustrated at work. I spiraled down pretty quickly. It was then that I realized \u201coh shit...I package KNIVES\u201d. I had constant thoughts of harming myself at work ever since. 10 hours a day of it. Over 3 days. It was torture. A million different intrusive thoughts. \n\nThis morning, I came in and got to work. It was busy and fast-paced as it had been the past few days, and I was already behind by 6:15 because my station buddy was, of course, not doing his job. Then he comes over and starts whining that I\u2019m going too fast for him, when he isn\u2019t even doing his share. I snapped at him, walked out, and went to go have an on-again-off again panic attack at a local park for the next 3 hours. I also talked to a few friends who helped me calm down and cope. \n\nNow that the dust has settled, I feel so good that I don\u2019t have to go back to that job ever again. I feel like a failure because I quit, but I\u2019m so proud of myself for not hurting myself and reaching out for help and support. I just hope I can find a new job soon that doesn\u2019t make me want to die. I was already applying elsewhere and looking for other opportunities, so now I\u2019m just going to focus on that and try to lock something down before my bills hit. \n\n\n\nTLDR: I walked out of my job at a knife sharpening factory that triggered me super badly and have mixed feelings, but overall am proud that I didn\u2019t hurt myself.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Later in the night she opened up a bit showed them to me (by herself, I didn't ask her to). We drank a lot, something I've learned she also struggles with. I had a really great time with her and it seems like she did too.\n\nLast night we met up again and she was a lot more open about her issues. We spoke about our pasts and hers was pretty fucking brutal to say the least. She got a message that triggered her although I didn't really notice how bad it was at that moment. \n\nShe cut herself in the restaurant bathroom. I suspected what she was doing in there and waited outside the bathroom but I didn't do anything to stop her. She came out bleeding and tried to cover it up. I tried to help her stop the bleeding and calm her down. She went to a smoking area where nobody else was and I went to get more tissues. She told me it was an accident and I told her it didn't matter how it happened. We left but I had to pay so she went outside without me. Luckily she didn't go far and was sitting down outside but I think she might have cut herself again. We sat together for a while while I held her wrist. She started getting better and we stayed the night at a hotel. Honestly the whole night was more lighthearted than it sounds, but that's why I need advice. Everything else about us hanging out is super normal and fun and wholesome. \n\nI have no idea how to approach all this. She just invited me out again tonight and idk if I should preemptively bring bandages or something or if that's weird.\n\nI understand I'm not gonna stop her from cutting anytime soon but I wanna be there for her and help in any way I can. What can I say to her if she's struggling? Should I just act like everything's fine? Should crack jokes and keep it lighthearted? Should we not drink? She romanticizes cutting and suicide and I'm worried for her, even though I've only known her for a week.  \n\nSorry for rambly the wall of text.

Hope this is an okay question to ask this. I've been cutting off an on for ~5 yrs and was just curious to know if my experience is normal or not. I do have some mental health issues but overall I've been feeling pretty good, not very depressed, etc but I still can't stop cutting and I think a lot of it is because it's become such a habit that it's just a thing that I do. I barely even feel the pain anymore, I think I've just blocked it out.\n\nAnd I think another part of it is because I like the feeling of taking care of myself after. I love sitting in bed and taking care of the wounds and then watching them heal. It's like I enjoy taking care of myself and being able to sit in bed and just relax. Another part of it is I just love watching the blood and seeing it. If there isn't much blood it's entirely unsatisfying.\n\nMy experience w/ self harm seems very unlike anyone else I know and I was just wondering if any of you could relate to any of this? Thanks.

She sent these screenshots to me and expected me to laugh at them but they really hurt me. I\u2019ve been struggling with body issues for a long time and she knows this and I\u2019m also questioning my gender so I felt really upset at these messages but played along saying that the guy was dumb and how funny it was that he said those things about me because I don\u2019t care haha because I don\u2019t like anyone to know when I\u2019m upset. These comments ended up making me break my longest clean streak in 5 years of 3 months and I haven\u2019t been able to go a day without cutting since then. So already I\u2019m doubting my friendship with her when today she sends me a message on snapchat and some guy I don\u2019t know also adds me on Snapchat,  she says she thinks he\u2019s the perfect guy for me and although I know that we had a conversation a few months back where I said I don\u2019t like strangers knowing my social media accounts and that I always keep my tinder matches on tinder for this reason, I assume she\u2019s forgotten, that she\u2019s trying to make a peace offering. The guy messages me, I message back and I don\u2019t really like him but to be polite I say I\u2019ll go out with him this Saturday (I\u2019m dreading it so much) and let her know what\u2019s happening. She then throws a fucking bomb at me and tells me she\u2019s 10 weeks pregnant, found out a week ago and wants me to take her to get an abortion because I\u2019m the only person she feels she can tell. I\u2019m in the uk so it\u2019s completely legal and people don\u2019t really care but I feel fucking betrayed. I\u2019m trying to be nice, I said I would, but after 7 years it just feels like the friendship has boiled down to her laughing at me and guilt tripping me into doing things for her and I feel so fucking angry and hurt and upset and I just want to die so I can avoid all of this situation. I just don\u2019t know how to feel about her anymore.\n\nTLDR - my friend of 7 years laughed about my appearance, caused me to break my clean streak, put me in an uncomfortable situation with a stranger from tinder and guilt tripped me into taking her to get an abortion.

But I work at an ice cream parlor (and an ice cream truck) where the uniform is short sleeves. I don\u2019t care if my co workers see my cuts and scars. But last night I was eating dinner with the fam and I worked afterwards and my dad mentioned they may have to come in and get ice cream from me.

And I didn\u2019t scurry off to the back fast enough I guess cause they saw me. So I had to help them trying to hide my left arm from them the whole time. After they left I was panicking that they saw. Cause last time they found out I was self harming my mom made me get TONS of therapy and nearly put me in a ward. I leave for college in three weeks so that was the last thing I wanted. When I finally got home my mom was waiting for me. She HAD seen. But she actually treated my like an adult about it and was ok with me waiting to see a therapist where I go to college?! She even didn\u2019t freak out at a really bad joke I made about cutting.

So you can imagine, these are very small, unnoticeable by sight, and do a lot of damage with the right amount of pressure. It was a habit of mine to wear flannels and keep these razorblades in the shirt pockets. Cause ya know, who the hell is going to randomly search my shirt pockets? Okay, onto the actual post. Sorry, I always talk too much.\n\nTL;DR: Real fucking close to relapsing and I don't know what to do. Kinda pointless honestly.\n\nThis morning I woke up feeling awful. Well, emotionally numb, but physically I feel sick. When I was leaving my house, I grabbed a razor head without thinking about it at all really. I came out of being numb only to be met with waves of anxiety of what I might do. I fully know now that I have it with me and all it would take is a little bit of work to get the razor out, and then that would be it. I would relapse. I've been wanting to relapse for several days now, and it's getting progressively worse. Tonight I have to walk out on the football field for some stupid recognition of an exam I took. That of course sends my anxiety through the fucking roof when it's already bad, and I don't know if I'll be able to resist the urge to cut. One part of me wants to go up to my girlfriend and lock the razor head in her hand, to just have her take it away from me so there's no chance of me hurting myself today, at least until wayyyyyy later when I'll hopefully be passed out(she's also coming home with me). But the other part of me wants to just hide it, to eventually relapse, and try to not let her see. I'm so scared I'm going to relapse no matter what I do, like I have to walk through a little more hell to get to being happy again. I guess if that's the case it'd be better for her to be with me so I don't cut any more when I get home. I just don't know what to do. Sorry for the wall of text.

So i left my house and sent her a photo of cuts on me when i was gone and said \"is that you wanted\" and i was having a mental breakdown until i calmed down and got home. and then my brother started talking to me. he started saying \"you're fucked up, you're not right, you cut yourself\"\n\nand things like\n\n\"i can't bring my son here bc the cuts marks on you\"\n\n\"i couldn't even bring my son on his 3rd birthday bc of you\"\n\n\"you're an emotional vampire\"\n\nand then \"people who cut themselves are delusional.\"\n\n\" if you kill yourself or cut yourself, i'm not gonna cry about it and i'm telling him (my younger brother) to do the same bc you do it to yourself, if you die, you did it to yourself!\"\n\nI don't know how to take this all in, i feel like my life is falling apart and everyone is cutting me off. And pretty much not even giving a shit about how i feel. But i'm shocked by this, idk if i even want to ever go to them for any of my problems. Part of me just wants to say \"they just don't understand me but i still like being around them\" the other side of me saying \"i shouldn't be around them anymore and i need to be around someone who would actually care if i was self harming or not\" I don't wanna put my problems on anyone and i don't want anyone to suffer and be in pain if i killed myself but having that being said is a wakeup call to me bc i don't feel like i should surround myself emotionally with people like that. Especially since he told my other brother to feel apathy if he sees cut marks on me or killed myself. If someone, a family member, a friend, someone i care about was suicidal and cutting, i'd do something about it and i'd try to help. I'd feel fucking hurt really bad if someone i loved offed themselves. Normally i'd be super upset that someone said that to me and rage at them and cry But what's the use? How is that gonna change anything? What if i do cry, cut myself, have an emotional breakdown in front of them and they still don't care? I'd be even more upset if that happened. what i should do? What should i really be taking from this conversation? Should i just be ok with the fact that my brothers wouldn't care don't care about my emotions? wouldn't care if i killed myself?", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I cut everyday. My arms are destroyed. I told my parents and I saw my therapist for the first time. I think she was good. But I lie and say that I stopped I really didn\u2019t. And my school is concerned about me. And my principle said she saw my arm. Because I was \u201c outgoing \u201c. And I\u2019m not this year. My parents won\u2019t allow me to be put on medication. And I\u2019m so close to getting my hands on cigarettes. And I\u2019m scared what might happen if I start doing that. My mom is going to murder me. At this point I wouldn\u2019t mind dying. I\u2019ve had suicidal thoughts more and more. I\u2019m not going to do it because there is shit to look forward to in my life ( I\u2019m 13 and in 8th grade ). I want to get piercings instead of cutting but my parents won\u2019t let me because I have too many. I have 5. And my arms and thighs remind me of everything. I overdose on pills. Not enough to kill me. Not even close. My mom was raising her voice at me in the car because if I cut deeper and \u201c accidentally \u201c hit a vein I\u2019ll be dead. It\u2019s like fuck thanks for that. My only 2 friends moved away. And I keep being told to fake it until you make it and life\u2019s a game. I hate it. I keep being told that my life isn\u2019t that bad and there\u2019s so many people with worse. That doesn\u2019t help either. I was so close to killing myself on Monday and so I didn\u2019t go to school but then my dad yelled at me because I didn\u2019t go. And I\u2019m faking being happy like I\u2019m being told to do. It\u2019s like fuck. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. And I feel like I\u2019m falling deeper into this hole. And I\u2019m sorry if this made no sense. Another thing I can\u2019t do right.

This has gone on 3 years, and last night an ex of mine said I should send him a picture of \u201cdown there,\u201d since he would likely be getting a girlfriend in the next two days.

We both let it go at that, and so this morning I found myself sitting on the bathroom floor with my legs spread, feeling like a complete whore for ever doing this. This guilt particularly comes from me having promised a long time ago I would never do this again, to someone I care about very much. Eventually, after seeing all the cuts on my thighs in the pictures and reminding myself of my promise, I told him I just wouldn\u2019t.

I used to have to test my glucose levels, which was incredibly triggering to me. I don't need to do so anymore due to a sensor I got, but I feel like taking shots is a bit triggering in and of itself. \\*TW\\* I used to use the needles that I tested my glucose levels with to harm myself. Now, I'm left with an abundance of them since I don't use them, but need to keep them for if my sensor fails. I feel like that's a more obvious way this illness has sort of \"enabled\" my self destructive behavior. Having the needles around is triggering, but at the same time, I need to keep them around. It's annoying.\n\nWhat I meant earlier about the shots was that just knowing I need to take the shots and use the needles to get my medicine and take care of myself gets to me sometimes. I know it's not self harm to take them, as I need to take them. But the sting from the medicine or the feeling of the needle reminds me of how I used to be. The fact it requires the use of needles makes me feel horrible sometimes. I know it's probably yet another form of self harm but sometimes I get anxious and don't want to take them properly, especially if I'm in a particularly bad place, mentally.\n\nI know it's not really proper. I know it's not really okay. But some advice with having to deal with the permanent need for the things I used to do bad things with would be greatly appreciated.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}
