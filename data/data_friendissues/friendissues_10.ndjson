I'm 21 female I don't have any friends or online  friends due to being backstabbed multiple times throughout my life i don't really know people in real life for advice, last year in October I reconnected with a friend from kindergarten he was all around good friend everything was a okay till last month  we got in a huge fight  about my health becaus I cancelled appointments because the doctors couldn't tell what I had, he blocked  me  on social media because I was having physical health issues he told me \" he couldn't bare seeing my profiles and thought I was serious forgiving up\" I told  him \"I'm doing this for me, I'm sorry I made you feel that way.\" During my semester in college in which I no longer attended due to physical health problems I found  out he was talking behind my back and I confronted him because someone who I never met or following me nor did i on an social this person was a complete stranger sent me a screenshot of a conversation between him and my former best friend of three years talking really bad about me and I confronted him with the screen, not only that he accused me of having other friends  that he did not know and he definitely knew i had no friends then and now  because they switched up on me,  I don't have any friends in real life or online he was the only friend I trusted him, he knew that, he acussed me that i threatened him suicide multiple times to which I never did. I told him what was happening between my family and that I was suffering from a mental illness that I needed help to get away from them. I never said \" I'm going to kill myself because  you're not talking to me\" I've never said that  it hurts me deeply to be accused of something I didn't do when I knew I didn't threatened him, he then goes on about why he blocked me because he felt threatened to which i realized his previous answer was a lie and it just crushed me there, he then proceeded to call me a stalker when I never stalked him I use social media to find online shops such as clothing or makeup, I felt like he used what I said to flip the script to make me look like I'm a horrible person and a toxic friend, I felt my trust was violated and I find myself second guessing if I was a toxic  person. currently I ended my relationship with my abusive ex boyfriend I'm also on in hiding because of my ex he due to him threatened to kill me if he finds me. I ran to another country in Hope's my ex wouldn't find me and to start a new life, I also let my friend since kindergarte know of the situation but was ignoring my text, I found he made really horrible lie to one of my former friends of 3 years i know how she shades people because she'd make low key posts and memes I know her well enough, I know because someone who I didn't know and didn't follow me nor did I follow that person, the person DMs me the screen shots and their conversations, I was honestly hurt by all this he basically told her that I was trying to \"stalk him in so and so country\" and that I was \"threatening him and how I was going to hurt.\" In reality I ran to another country to hide from my ex boyfriend who's trying to hurt me and to start a life of my own, it was the last straw I delete my social media because at this point I felt like people were keeping tabs on me for my ex boyfriend or my friend. Recently I mad new social accounts to start fresh and set to private not only keeping my face out of the profile picture, since deleting and remaking my accounts I feel a weight lifted off my shoulders.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Soon I found a amazing friend who I'll call F (Friend) For obvious reasons. He made me feel amazing. I had never felt more happy in my life. If I had been down a day he was at school, He would cheer me up. He never failed to make me smile. I was never mad at him. Ever. But around grade 6 (2 years ago) He left my school. I was heart-broken. My longtime friend who never made me sad had just left me and I was left with only his memory. His parents never allowed him to use a phone (Which is understandable now seaming as he was a very religious Sri Lankan) so I had NO way to contact him.\n\nWhen I was friends with him he made me hang out with a group of boys who were nice; When he was around. After F left they started to make \"Jokes\" like, \"Well aren't you the whitest thing I've met!\" and \"Hello Albino!\". They said that they were jokes but I never felt like they were. They felt like insults like the ones I had endured so long ago. It got so bad by grade 7 I wanted to kill myself due to the extremeness of the jokes. I felt super lonely. I just wanted F to come back. Even if it was for one day. He always showed me what it felt like to be a great friend. When I got my depression I got this idea in my head: 'If they were going to be a toxic piece of shit to me, why not return the favor?'. I started to be as toxic as them. Day in day out. I still do it and I feel empty inside. I don't feel human not because of their toxic; but because of my own. I was only wondering if my behavior is terrible and I need to change (Only myself) or if we all should change. Or if I should be friends with then at all. I'm posting this to Reddit cause I'm scared they call me a 'pussy for not being a proper man'. What are my options?\n\nIf you listened to my story all the way through and responded to my question, thank you. You are an amazing person.  \n\n\nEdit: Me and my friends have a talk since this was posted and have made up. We all still poke fun at each other, but make sure to not be assholes. Expect one who is a real pain in the ass. I have SO much to talk about with him so I might bring it up on a different sub. Thanks for reading this edit.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I made a new one because I have friends and family who use reddit and they might recognize my username.\n\nMy thoughts are all over the place, so I apologize if one topic suddenly jumps to another.\n\nAnyways, I just feel like I am going through a rough period in my life right now. I am not sad, nor am I happy. The things I used to love doing, have become stressful to me as if they've become chores that I am forced to do. I've always had anxiety, but for the past 3 weeks it feels like it's gotten worse, and it's constantly there.\n\nI'm not doing much in life, I took a semester off from school because I wanted to work and dance (which was the thing I used to love). I'm not doing much, yet I feel stressed and tired? These feelings are confusing to me because I don't understand why I feel this way. \n\nI'm just going to dive deeper into things that bother me.\n\nFirst there's my job. I work at a fast food restaurant, and I would much rather work in at some clothing place, but I'm just too comfortable at my workplace for some reason. I think what's stopping me is because I don't want to go through the whole training process again, and I get decent hours at my current job, whereas I don't know how it'll be at a new one if I got hired.\n\nSecond there's school. I am in a computer programming course, and I am neither loving it or hating it. I hate how difficult learning and understanding programming languages are, but I love it when I successfully complete an assignment or if I am able to get any code to work. I think there's just a little more hate because I FIND IT SOOO DIFFICULT! If I wanted to do well in this program I feel like I need to make it my number one priority and just study like I have nothing else to do.\n\nThird there's dance. I love dancing, but I just feel like I need to stop even though I'd like to see myself grow and improve as a dancer. Every time I have dance practice  I feel uncomfortable, and that I do not have the ability to dance. My body feels tense and like it can't move like it used to.\n\nFourth, this is kind of a 2 in 1 point, but it's relationships and who I am as a person. I have always thought I was decent looking, but it's just my personality which is a turn off. I am introverted, and I THINK I lack responsibility and maturity. I've had this let's have fun and just live life mind set, but the women I have been attracted to I noticed seemed to be the opposite. I have been interested in this one girl for some time now, I feel like she wants someone more mature than me. That being said I have this constant thought of just becoming a whole new person just to fit someones ideal type.\n\nI had more to say, but I didn't want this read to be too long. Also it's 5am and I am tired.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

So I circled it down a little bit, but she still played dumb. After a few circling down she laughed (that awkward laugh) and said ooooh wow yeah and then quickly changed the subject.\n\nI don't how what to do, I don't know how to act. \nShould I ask her again? Should I act like nothing happened? What's the right move here?\n\nI don't want to lose her as a friend.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

You're probably wondering how I got up here.\n\nI've posted here before but I love talking to people so here we go again.\n\nI'm Mars (not my real name, just a shortened form). I live in Hong Kong, I work at a super cool company and supervise a bunch of slightly older than me kids, and I cry over videos of people getting married too often.  I **love love love** randomly getting called in the middle of my day to talk about things and I spend my entire day at work scouring nosleep threads and tweeting hornily. I read and write poetry and watch too many TV shows and am incapable of keeping up with any of them. With that said, you can always ask if you need recommendations or suggestions because I speak around 5-7 languages and really good at giving my both unwanted and wanted opinion.\n\nIf hating avocados was a personality trait, that would be like, *my thing.*  Like in quirky coming-of-age movies where the main character has that super-cool-thing-that-nobody-else-ever-does but in reality, it's super common? Yeah, that's mine. Avocados taste like wet grass and I just don't get them. Like, what the fuck is up with avocados.\n\nSuper basic taste but here's *some* stuff I listen to - girl in red, The Smiths, The 1975, The Kooks, Hozier, salvia plath, Dandelion Hands, Hippocampus, Flatsound, and just about anything else, I'm not picky. \n\nI'm like, mildly funny and I have this thing where my mind just can't settle on one accent so I switch between a British and an American really frequently.

I'm only posting it here because the main crux of the issue is whether or not I should continue a friendship.]\n\nSo some context: \n\nI've had this really good friend who I've crushed on for about a year, but recently things got complicated and it got to the point where it was toxic to my mind - I couldn't deal with having to secretly admire someone anymore. So in a last-ditch attempt to get over her, I spilled everything, how I felt, what I wanted from now on - which wasn't for us to date, I knew that would never happen. Before any of you ask, yes, I'm extremely clear that she would not date me, trust me, it's not just my self-esteem telling me that.\n\nPrior to this we were texting each other almost every day for about a year and a half now. But after a three weeks apart she looked me up to hang out, and things felt different this time. It wasn't awkward perse, but we didn't laugh or joke as we used to. When I looked at her, where I once felt love, friendship and chemistry, I felt nothing. I'm definitely over her, but it makes me question if our friendship was even real in the first place. \n\nSo what happens now?

All feedback is encouraged as well.\nAnyways, just a couple months ago, I stopped being friends with one of the only best friends I had left. We were inseparable up until she had her baby; and after that, our friendship was deemed never the same. Our friendship was something out of a movie. The ones where u feel will be by ur side no matter how sideways life gets or how bad of a shit show we endure from it. I thought that if a friendship like that could endure so much resilience than we should be good in the future. Right? Wrong. At the time, I was 21 and she was still 20(we always joked about her bday always being the last to come up out of all our friends)- At the time, she started dating one of my now fianc\u00e9es best friend. I was ecstatic because shit! We\u2019re best friends &amp; our men are best friends too! What more could we want?! Well let me tell u: Fuck that! It wasn\u2019t even remotely like anything I would imagine they would be together. Geez they turned into a fucking nightmare of a toxic relationship and that ofcourse affected mine &amp; my bestfriend\u2019s entire friendship whether we wanted to see it for the real ness of it or not. (we\u2019ll call her grace to protect the privacy of her name) \nGrace and her man(my fianc\u00e9es bestfriend) ended up breaking up and making up, perhaps too much to even count. It was draining enough having her ask me for advice that just always resulted in completely doing what she was going to do ANYWAYS regardless of the advice I gave her. My fianc\u00e9e and I were constantly dragged into their toxic mess of a relationship. Grace\u2019s man(we\u2019ll call him Philip) was just overwhelmingly abusive to her in all aspects. Not sure if physically but for sure mentally and emotionally. I hated them being together after a while. I just felt like they really were not a compatible match. They just wouldn\u2019t get along- and grace thought that by having a baby by him, that it was going to somehow fix their relationship. So here I go telling her that it\u2019s LITERALLY NOT A GOOD IDEA especially with the way their relationship was heading... He\u2019s just not a good person.  Very toxic. And so they started trying for a baby. Maybe like three months passed, mind u still trying for a baby; No sign of grace being pregnant. \nSo she tells me \u201cfuck it I\u2019m never going to get pregnant, let\u2019s get drunk tonight. I\u2019ll throw a gtg\u201d and so she did right? Long story short, they end up getting into this huge ugly fight that resulted in her moving out of philips house and then she finds out three weeks later that she\u2019s fucking pregnant. \nAnd in the span of those three weeks I was hoping to just let that friendship go bcuz that itself was beyond toxic even for me. And I\u2019m the type to not be conforming to shit so it really pissed me off when I found out. They ended up getting back together and that\u2019s when I slowly but surely started to notice her own identity diminish every time she gave a little piece of herself to Philip and their child. She became bitter, her hormones made her become this shallow critical person. She become isolated, and antisocial. It got to the point where I was in fact her only friend left. \nThat wasn\u2019t the problem for me at all. The problem with me was that she became selfish- just like her man. She expected me to be there at her god given mercy every time helping her with her kid. Me doing it out of the kindness of my heart bc she had literally no one. But then I would think back to myself and say that I wasn\u2019t the one who decided to have a kid. Not sure if she wanted me to feel bad that she regretted having the baby so early in her youth? But that\u2019s how it felt. I felt like she was legit stuck in that relationship. In that life now. I could see it in her eyes. But then again, it was all her doing. After she had her son, She always wanted me to go the extra mile for her but never wanted to do the same for me. She would guilt trip me &amp; not speak to me for weeks just because I would go out with friends and family without her. Mind u, I was having consideration for her being a mom now. I understood that life. But she wouldn\u2019t accept it. She would get jealous with my other friends. I would always look for her, but at the end of the day she would have rather acted petty &amp; passive aggressive with me than to actually help me solve our issues together. And she felt like I was intentionally having fun \u201cwithout her\u201d? Like shes a mom now, this is how she should least be acting. She wanted me to sit here and rack my brain up for her as to why she wouldn\u2019t text, call, or look for me. Eventually after a year, I honestly became so drained and tired of the one always putting my 110% and always being the \u201cbigger person\u201d when she wouldn\u2019t even do shit to try and change. I would even call her out on it and she would admit to \u201cbeing a shitty friend to me\u201d but honestly never tried changing. She even got so upset with me about something that she didn\u2019t talk to me or reply me for weeks, again. \nSo like a month ago was her bday and I didn\u2019t bother telling her happy birthday. She got upset, even unfriended me on every social media platform, and that was that. \n(I apologize if I sorta went off topic- this is more of a rant)", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Or are they toxic to me and I need to leave them?", "author": "Dramingo", "self_text": "Hey reddit this may be long so bear with me. \n\nI\u2019ve recently come into trouble with two of my friends who I\u2019ll call friend A and friend B. Some context:\n\nFriend A: B\u2019s best friend and I kinda joined the trio. They\u2019re known for being opinionated and stubborn. \n\nFriend B: I became good friends with them which in turn became dating. This caused some stress between us and friend A due to them having had feelings for B in the past and having to be a third wheel. We broke up due to B\u2019s mental health and it was a bad breakup and my heart felt like it went through a meat grinder. But we were a trio so I thought we could be friends. \n\nEver since we came back to uni B has been not a good friend. Just a few of the things they\u2019ve done: slept with my crush at a party where they were supposed to be my wingman. Missed my first game of the season because they had \u201chomework\u201d after they had free time in the afternoon to buy plants and food for a couple hours. They boast that they have one of my shirts and that they have a shirt from every ex and when I asked for it back I needed a good reason to have it back other than the fact it was mine. (I wasn\u2019t comfortable at the time telling them I didn\u2019t like being considered a trophy because they were drunk). They get drunk and flirt with me. They avoid hanging out with me unless they need something because I\u2019m \u201cemotionally draining\u201d. However the straw finally broke the camels back and everything went to hell. \n\nI broke my arm in a fall but waited to go to the campus doc because broke college student. The campus doc couldn\u2019t see me until late afternoon because they were booked. I get a call from B asking me to take them to the ER because they have difficulty breathing. I hop on the next bus to my apartment and drive to their apartment on my broken arm figuring I\u2019ll get seen as well because my arm is in too much pain to wait until 4. They get seen by ER doc before me. When I\u2019m in my waiting room to be seen B texts me asking if I\u2019ve been seen. I say no but should be soon. B says they\u2019re finished and they\u2019ll just take an Uber home rather than wait for me. I told B I was worried about not being able to drive home but they complained their whole day had been uprooted and that they had to catch up. I felt abandoned and alone in that moment. So I reached out to friend A. A tells me I\u2019m in the wrong. That I should have directly asked friend B to stay in the ER with me. I told A I didn\u2019t think I would have to ask my friend B to stay in the ER with me as that kind of goes without saying. A says \u2018no it isn\u2019t you have to ask for what you want and that people have other commitments\u2019. A then goes so far as to ask if my arm is actually broken and ask that a doctor actually said it was broken. That felt like a slap in the face to have my friend think I would lie about an injury. So I stopped talking to A and went on a server I\u2019m in for my uni. I told them about the situation leaving out names and identifying things and asked if I was justified to be upset with their behavior. The server all agreed and said A&amp;B were being assholes and selfish. That I should find better friends. People I\u2019ve never met before offered to come wait with me so I wouldn\u2019t have to be alone and I wouldn\u2019t have to drive on a broken arm. \n\nI ignored A and B for a few days because I felt betrayed. I reach out to A a couple days later and they suddenly turned the conversation around saying we can\u2019t be friends anymore and they know what I did. I asked for clarification and A mentioned the server saying they know what I said and they're not okay with it. I ask A what they mean and they accused me of playing games and again says they know what I said and they\u2019re not okay with it. I was in shock so I didn\u2019t reply. I still haven\u2019t. I didn\u2019t think I had done anything wrong. I reached out to the server cause I felt like I was being gaslit and I wanted outsider opinions. \n\n\nI have not heard from A or B since then. We are in a mutual DnD server and I have been radio silent while they\u2019ve been active. I feel heartbroken to have lost people I thought were my friends. \n\nSome friends have said to give it time and others have gone so far as to say A has been sabotaging me from the beginning because she was jealous of my relationship with B. It\u2019s greatly affecting my mental health and uni performance and I just don\u2019t know what to do anymore. \n\n\nReddit is there anyway I could salvage this friendship? Or are my server friends right in that they are toxic and I\u2019m better off without them? What about salvaging a relationship with B but not A? B hasn\u2019t said anything to me since the ER. \n\nIf this would be better suited elsewhere let me know.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

So basically my best friend, wasn\u2019t hanging out with me, wasn\u2019t really talking to me, stuff like that. So I basically wrote him a letter (which was probably a bad idea but I didn\u2019t think of it at the time) and I wasn\u2019t aggressive at all, and I had said I missed him and take into account he\u2019s been my best friend for a good 3 years, we told each other everything etc. but anyways, I wasn\u2019t aggressive in the letter and he\u2019s been pretty busy so I mentioned in the letter that I was totally okay with him being busy and I understood. So he took it with him to class, and I\u2019m not sure exactly what happened, but somehow one of his other friends got ahold of the letter whether that be he gave it to her or she took it (I\u2019m pretty sure he gave it to her because he could have easily gotten it back) but she read it out loud to a couple of their friends and he had said that it was my fault and he just wanted to hang out with his girlfriend (he didn\u2019t even say a word to me about dating her) and I had felt like he wasn\u2019t making time for me or anything. So he has been talking some trash about me (not too much though) but I had been trying to talk to him anyways like friends do, but I never really talked to him for more than a couple minutes at a time. So after he got the letter, he texted me with a gamepigeon message (funny right lol). So I blocked him and he hasn\u2019t reached out to me once. Before any of this happened, I had kinda felt like whenever I was feeling that something wasn\u2019t right and I talked to him about it, he always dismissed it or low key said it was my fault, but I guess at the time I didn\u2019t notice. So I\u2019ve just been ignoring him, because I don\u2019t know what else to do, should I leave it alone and learn my lesson or should I reach out?????", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Lets call her \"A\". And we also have a friend, \"B\" who lives 4 minutes from me. \"B\" has known a for a year or two longer than me, so I've always considered them to be slightly closer to each other than they are to me. \n\nBefore \"A\" went off to college me and \"B\" promised that we would visit her sometime through the year. And recently she's been have some issues with her dorm mate, and had to pretty much get new dorm mates. And she's struggling grade wise too. I didn't find out about her dorm mate issues until \"B\" told me and i was cautious about asking \"A\" if she was ok, because she didn't tell me directly. And this is how most information is giving to me. \n\nIts alway they called each other taking on the phone for hours updating each other, but with me its like they give me a short summary whoever they see me in person. \n\nAbout a two week ago \"B\" texted me saying that she was off Monday thru Thursday and wanted to go visit \"A\". Which I had explained to her that i would be able to because I'm busy throughout the week with school clubs, working, and helping my siblings with homework, eating, and getting to bed.( But i didn't really elaborate, thinking that she knew this already because we've known each other for about three years now) So i asked her if we could go on a friday when I'm free, which she just repeated the days that she's available. So i told her id let her know.\n\nAnd this past friday she texted me begging that we go and i told her i could but i could only stay for about two hours. And i also texted \"A\" asking for her schedule to see if it was worth me driving an hour away and coming back. Which it turns out that its not because \"A will be in class when \"B\" and i get to her school and shell get out of class when its time for me to leave. I explained this to both of them and they both said its fine, and \"B\" keeps pushing me to go. \n\nSo we decided to go leave on Wednesday at 1 get there by 3, and i leave at 5. And \"B\" will stay on campus with \"A\" until friday, and they'll drive back together cause \"A\" was suppose to come back into town anyways. Which i really feel like we can just hang out on Friday when \" A\" gets into town and hang out until she leaves sunday. But they don't want to do that.\n\nAnd ive started to realize that \"B\" only texts me when she needs a quick 5, 10, 15, 20 dollars i can cash app her or when she wants to see \"A\" and doesn't have a ride because she currently doesn't have a car. And in our group chat with \"A\", \"B\", and i they keep saying things like \"i can't wait to see you guys\". But again \"B\" lives four minutes away from me and never makes any plans with me like what she does with \"A\". And the other day on Snapchat they both had screenshots of their one hour calls talking to each other with the caption \"Cant wait to see my best  friend\". Which i wouldn't be bothered by all of this if they didn't constantly call me their best friend, but they do. And when i do try and check up on them they say stuff like \"i was going to eventually tell you\" but if something happens to them, they immediately call each other. \n\nSo pretty much in my head i feel like they put more of an effort with each other than they do with me.

I come from psychologically abusive family and I've been bullied very bad in the past. I have always been taught that blind obedience of law and submitting to will of higher ups is the only way to protect myself, but if I want to learn how to fight the abuse I'm a bad rotten person who doesn't deserve support nor help. But that's not how the world works unless one wants to run from one abusive setting to another. When I was a kid, people didn't just bully me verbally but also stole from me and approached me only to humiliate me later - I wasn't allowed to get my stuff back nor get back at them, even teachers took their side. I tried to be \"good\" friend to people get that in return from others... instead of inviting more ill will into my life. But I was too good, to a fault. And now I get accused for being too strict or boring by most people. Because I don't fight back (it's not allowed, I don't know how to without even more drama coming my way) but I do stand up for my boundaries. Change of scenery and social circles doesn't help. I'm still isolated and rejected by most people. Nobody wants to invite me into anything, I don't get opportunities to do anything \"normal people do\" (unless I buy those opportunities) and I'm worried about trying anything alone due to previously always walking on eggshells. What seemed helpful was meant to harm me later.\n\nI still get drained by most human contact very easily (being introverted), so it does play a part why I'm not getting my social wishes met. I don't like coming on too strong on others, although I can be intense when it comes to being reliable and trustworthy. Nowadays people are generally becoming even more noninvolved and prefer shallow and short-lived relationship be it dating or friendship. I can't afford hobbies either as jobs are being given to foreigners who are cheaper workforce.. so I can't connect through hobbies or mutual interests... nor can I buy someone to watch my back against abuse or teach me how to handle the shitshow of human society. It's also exhausting to keep track of all changes that are happening in the world and society when you are just isolated like me. Two or three heads think better than one. One that falls gets run over by others who have more resources and influence. I've had a wake up call that being like my parents... narcissistic, manipulative, aggressive and selfish... actually would get me ahead in every aspect of life rather than trying to be a honest, chill and fair person... or how others would put it \"good and proper person\".\n\nI even had a period (6 years or so) in life I tried to train myself to toughen up, care less about others and rolled in all sorts of social mud to \"break\" my inner code and just become like a person who could make it in this society. Gain more than lose. Get your hands dirty rather than being that good soul. It didn't work.\n\nI feel I'm back where I started. Being myself didn't help - I received abuse and no friends. Trying to imitate other people didn't help - I just wasted time and energy + no friends either. Being alone means being vulnerable to being overwhelmed by groups of abusive people. Am I somehow cursed or doomed to be imprisoned in a state of life where it'll be like no matter what I do, it doesn't change anything.\n\nTell me, is there anything I can do that actually works and helps me getting reliable/good friends? Or am I doomed? If you were looking for a friend, would you give priority for their social standing/money/etc or their good nature. And what is good nature to you?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We rarely have issues with each other and, when we do, we can communicate perfectly. He's a really good friend and im glad that i know him.\n\nMe and P have known each other for about a year and we've been okay-ish. He's not the best when it comes to owning up to his mistakes but you know, he's a good friend and no one's perfect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI met A around the same time as P, about a year ago and at first, he was a really cool guy. We liked the same video games, we had the same hobbies, we hang out a lot, and overall it was fun. Until after a month or so he..changed a lot. His normal jokes started turning into him passively aggressively criticizing us about anything.\n\n\"Why do you do your hair like that, are you stupid or something?? Haha\"\n\n\"If you do this, then you really must be dumb you know hahah\"\n\n\"People that think this way are literally the stupidest people alive no joke\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nT didn't really speak up about it but he seemed uncomfortable every time, and I didn't say anything either , which I *really regret..* Summer rolled around and P really started getting fed up with A's behavior so anytime A did that, P always told him to \"Stop doing it, it's making me uncomfortable\" A didn't change, and instead made it about how P is overreacting and how \"he's the wrong one, not me, right?\"\n\nAfter a month of that, P and A argued and P stopped hanging around with us. I could have done something about it, but I didn't cause i was afraid of losing A. really stupid thinking back on it..\n\nAnyway, when school exams finished, A told us he wanted to stopped hanging with T and Me, cause we apparently had \"different interests and it wont work out\". Now, i would gladly say yes but then, i tried to keep him close to us, desperately.\n\nWe ended up arguing mid-June or so, about me over-thinking stuff because i have really bad anxiety, to which he replied with \"It's your fault, stop over-thinking you dumbass, not my problem\"... and we didn't talk until around mid-August. I was really happy during that time, and I started feeling miserable when we started talking again.\n\nNow he's into his *good guy* part of the cycle acting all friendly but still being passive aggressive . We started hanging out with P again, and he seems like he really changed for the better, but he was alright already.\n\nFor the last two weeks A has been talking about P behind his back to us and it's not okay, and now i learned my lesson, so im telling him calmly to \"Please stop doing it, he's our friend, why are you like this\" . Today he told me that he's noticed that ive been avoiding him. I don't know of any other way to cut him off.. It's the worst way to cut normal people off, but he isn't normal. People change. People are empathetic. People don't think they're perfect. People don't judge everyone.\n\nIve been trying to run away from this for the last month and I dont know how im going to do it. He has more to gain if he makes me seem bad. I could lose my other friends, anything that i foolishly told him he could say to everyone as he did with P. Im not afraid about me, but about other people's stuff. They didn't do anything wrong, yet if A decides to do that, they'll be hurt. \n\n Confronting him about it isn't probably the way to go, if we take P's example.

She'd been struggling with school/work issues for a while then and I think this was the last straw for her. She's been unemployed since then, living with her parents, dealing with insomnia, lost all of her friends but me and a couple others because she felt she \"needed to pretend to be happy around them\" and that made her exhausted. I initially took it as a sign that she was grieving and tried to be supportive to the best of my ability, but it never went away and almost a year afterwards she was still blaming how miserable she was on her uncle's death and how no one understands how she's feeling and that she can't just move on, like people apparently expect her to do. She acts like she's alright around others, but then complains people don't get her and don't understand that she's still dealing with her uncle's death when they try to get closer to her.\n\nTo make matters worse, she lost her dog around a month ago. He was very old but it was all very abrupt and it was, understandably, completely devastating for her. She's kept herself busy with a new part-time job she got before it happened but she's constantly ranting about it and she keeps telling me she \"knows she's going to crash as soon as her contract is over\", like she's waiting for the time to go back to being miserable all the time.\n\nI'm also dealing with depression myself. I started seeking therapy about two years ago after years of undiagnosed depression, anxiety, isolation, suicidal thoughts, the whole package. It's been such a rough time but I'm finally able to manage and be in control of my feelings for the most part and catch myself when I'm back on my bullshit. Needless to say her being like this also impacts me, and I'm getting worried because at this point it's getting more frustrating than anything else for me and I'm starting to roll my eyes at her instead of feeling any empathy.\n\nI'm honestly at a loss on how to react to her at this point. Every time she comes to talk to me it's either to rant about her day or someone else she knows, or to tell me about how miserable she is, how bad this year has been, then the moment I try to nudge her thoughts in a different direction she just brushes me off. It's hard because I'm learning not to validate my own bullshit to stay afloat myself, so I can't validate her for being toxic towards herself and others, but I feel like I'm the asshole for trying to be positive around her. \n\nI just don't know what to do, and I can't tell if I'm the one being unreasonable here. I've tried telling her to try therapy but she doesn't listen. Any advice I could offer feels out of place and unsolicited and she just wouldn't listen to it anyway, and I don't want to be the obnoxious asshole that had depression but got better and tells people to try yoga and drink water.

I'm a senior in high school, and my school is pretty shitty (as most high schools are). Along with that, most people are shitty. Junior year, my friend group was a close circle of me and 2 other girls (me, L, and T). T and I had been friends longer than we had each been friends with L for. L had some shit going on at home and in her personal life. She fell into a pretty dark place and me and T couldn't really get to her. This other girl, S (I had my reservations about her initially but we're chill now) was the only one able to cheer her up and get her going again. So me and T thought, oh that's good, and we all started hanging out again. Dynamic was pretty odd most of the time; T would shit talk S to me, L would shit talk T to me, S would shit talk L to me and so on. I ended up getting kinda close to S because we shared a similar mindset but still, kinda wondered who was shit-talking me, yanno. I had more important stuff going on that time of my life so I didn't pay that much attention to it. S and T both ended up graduating early bc they didn't like our school and started community college instead. By the time the school year was over, S and L had stopped being friends over some guy drama and other fucked up shit. T went on vacation and I started a summer that was pretty busy with classes and an internship, etc. I talked to S at another friend's birthday party later that summer and everything was fine but she seemed superficial like she used to back before I actually became friends with her.\n\nSo that is the history part. Moving on to this year...\n\nL and I haven't talked at all since S and her fell out. She basically cut herself off from everyone and is basically going rouge. Beginning of school year was alright, trying to figure out who I should hang out with instead. I have really bad social anxiety so in short, this shit has not been good for me. Although I have other friends, none of them have really welcomed me to sit with them at lunch, etc, or even hang other than like one person (F), who isn't always sitting there at lunch and its just kind of unreliable. I've ended up just kind of going to the library and being alone in there, but my appetite is always changing and weird bc of some health problems so sometimes I just HAVE to get food. I ended up eating at a table with F's friends (not really with; they were kind of just there, and F wasn't, and they moved away from me when I sat down) one time, and then in a bathroom stall. I really try to avoid having to get food but sometimes I really can't. This really triggers the hell out of my social anxiety so it is really emotionally draining for me. I feel really salty that my friends just decided to up and leave me, basically.\n\nOther than that, here is actual shit-storm storytime.\n\nT and I were hanging out at the mall one weekend. Her parents are super protective but especially hate me (didn't find out why until recently; she told them I hit my dab pen in her bathroom even though I didn't, just had it on me). She can't lie to her parents for shit. She has ADHD and some other anxiety disorders that were really taking a toll on her. I suggested CBD for it (I take CBD and it helps me). There were some legal issues to it that kind of left my brain when I was telling her about it and ended up giving her a pill. Later that night, her dad calls my parents saying I gave her prescription medication and my parents, although knowing it was just CBD got really mad at me for giving it to her when I wasn't supposed to. I can't really handle my parents being mad at me, and basically my whole life I've finessed all the shit I'm not supposed to do, so it really upset me. My parents were apologizing to her shit stick of a father (who is hella abusive and just dumb as hell in other ways) for giving her that pill. I was mad and didn't talk to her for a long ass time after that. Then I was like alright, whatever and I texted her and she apologized, etc. \n\nSince then, her dad has been hella problematic about me hanging out with her. Even though I never peer-pressure her into anything, was probably the only friend of hers who does well academically and actually was stable (compared to her other friends who are complete messes), he doesn't like me (which is just really hypocritical at this point considering the kind of person he is). So I see her hanging out with so many other people on snapchat and stuff, she doesn't even bother talking to me a lot and I just always feel like that one friend who has to chase people to hang out or talk, etc. She bailed on me for homecoming, so now I'm not going. Her dad wouldn't even let her be my guest for homecoming and she was going to go as someone else's guest which just pisses me off. I don't know what to do because even though I have social anxiety I'm pretty extroverted and I need to spend time with people and things like that. I just feel really isolated and it's getting to me. I want to be able to actually enjoy my senior year but its getting hard. Every friendship I have, even if we're (best friends) no one puts in a similar amount of effort into the friendship and is always just chasing short fun moments with other people even if they're crappy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; my \"best\" friend's dad hates me and doesn't let her hang with me, I lost all my other friends and IDK what to do.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I think a big part of that for me is that she really is the only person I talk to consistently. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just looking for someone or someones understanding, that kind of gets how toxic relationships feel and might want to share some of the insight they\u2019ve learned with someone else. I\u2019m queer so that\u2019s also a factor and something they\u2019d have to be comfortable with. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this sounds crazy, but I honestly just feel so alone and that I need to start reaching out in someway before I drown. Talking about my hardest/darkest crap to strangers might seem weird, but I don\u2019t know how else to get it out there and be truly open about what\u2019s going on inside.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I thought to give it a chance and try to find a friend somewhere here.\n\nAs tradition seems to require, I need to write a line or two about me. Here I go. I am a \"surely not resembling,\" a 24 years old guy, fighting with his health circumstances every breathing moment. I consider myself a highly optimistic person with a lot of hopes and dreams for the future. Currently, I am in the process of obtaining my degree in Art and Design.  \n\n**You might ask what I am doing here?** Well, as my health declined during the years, so did my social life. A once highly social person as I were -\" the golden boy of the village,\" I gradually turned into myself and became very reserved. Friends which I grew up with went on their separate ways, and so did I. Every difficulty and concern I have had, I suppressed in me. It is starting to show now. I need to be listened to. I have a lot to say. \n\n**What could we, as possible friends, talk about?** My musical preferences vary. I listen to every kind of music. I cannot wait to listen to new music, currently unaware it exists. The only type of movies and tv-shows I don't like are the ones with superheroes. I read sometimes. Not as much as I want, though. I am looking to change that. I like to talk about philosophy even though I am aware that I am quite naive in the subject.\n\n**Who could be my friend?** A mature minded person whose primary intention is to converse with me, respectively, and possibly share with him/her my concerns and worries. I am a good listener. I will carry my share load of your concerns and try to advise you as good as I can and know.\n\nLastly, I just need to say that I need a different perspective on me. I have been standing too close to the elephant, and now I don't know what I am seeing, really. You may want the same for yourself also. I assume throughout the text, I made my intentions clear.

One is to simply make new connections (and hopefully experience the excitement that comes when both of you are eager to get to know each other).\n\nThe other is the fact that my social circle (co-workers I interact with at work not counted) is a sausage party and I'd like to change that.\n\nHowever, I do hope that you live in Sweden, as I hope to create new relationships with people to meet \"in real life\". My location is close to Stockholm. However, I could also dig people somewhere else in the world as I am up late at night, from time to time.\n\n# Now, to introduction.\n\n* I work for a nightclub as a runner. In short, restocking the bar on ice, glasses or alcohol. Pick glasses from counters/tables/floor and have them cleaned or disposed. Clean up where necessary. I also worked simultaneously as a waiter for the first half of the year until the restaurant closed down. **The pattern here is that I enjoy working in social environments where people come to have a good time.**\n* In the beginning of August, I felt the desire to have some of that passion and liveliness from younger adult days come back to me, this time alongside being much more mature. **So I returned to the gym after a few months hiatus, this time to get more stronger/fit than ever, by far**. By extension, I hope to return to martial arts, one day.\n* I dig taking photos with my camera, from time to time. **There is something special about having neat photos to clarify one's memories/experiences.** Aside from that, I dig video games, anime and books. I've kinda fallen out from all things live action, at the moment. I'm especially passionate about video games when it comes to single-player story experiences. Give me things like Final Fantasy VII, The Last of Us, Xenoblade Chronicles-series and we all good.\n* My life is currently very much home/work/gym but that's because **almost none of my friends are into going to bars, clubs or anything lile that. I would love it if you're the kind of person who likes to go to these social \"venues\".** As it's not yet that cold, I enjoy just merely strolling in/around town and sit down in a coffee house. Simply, enjoying myself with only myself.\n* I do not have any longterm plans ahead right now (studying/traveling/etc). This is because I finally, this year, feel (so) good with where I currently am in life, and so I shall simply enjoy myself for now. There will be a time where I feel the desire for something else. **Slow and steady wins the race.**\n* Finally, this is what I look like: [https://i.imgur.com/hdBefhZ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/hdBefhZ.jpg)\n* Recent haircut - [https://i.imgur.com/2XfYZWR.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/2XfYZWR.jpg)", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I've been home sick the past five days now with bronchitis so that desire for human interaction is at peak right now, and coupled with the fact that I'll likely be up all night because of it anyway, I'd really appreciate the company.  \n\n\nI am a 24 y/o male that is currently living back home with family after having lived separately from them for about eight years. I currently reside in North Dakota (unfortunately), which is where I grew up, but I've lived in Montana and Washington as well, the former being where I was born while the latter being what I believe to be the true home of my heart. I have many creative hobbies, including but not limited to; writing, photography, digital art, and music production. Some of my more general interests include; reading, vidya (I have PC, PS4, and Xbox One S), anime/manga, memes, music (my lifeblood), philosophy, people, space, unintentional existential panic attacks, and cooking!   \n\n\nI personally adhere to the philosophical beliefs of the Greek Stoics, and try to maintain these values as best as I can in the world that I live in. I'd like for the Discord to be a place where people can chill and have healthy discourse with each other regardless of whatever comprises their individual identities.

A few years ago I meet a guy , let's call him David. \n\nHe sent me a private message asking me if I do commissions , I explain him that I didn't , then he proceeded to ask me for a request , again I told him no. He accepted and went on with his day. Having never encountered a Choosing beggar in person before I was left a bit disappointed ,maybe that's why I was able to recognise the username of David when he left a comment in one of my drawings some time latter. It was a drawing of a specific character that David seemed to be obsessed with. The comment was nothing out of the ordinary , just your tipical fanboy drooling over his waifu type of comment that you see by the millions on the fandom. Which is way I was a bit surprised when this comment was answered with a rather aggressive response.\n\nThe user that responded to David called him a creep , a perver , a pedo and a disgusting human being that refuses to accept that his waifu is not real id needed to be put on his place.This really called my attention , like , what's this guy\u00b4s problem?, so I went to his profile and one of the last posts was precisely talking about David. In resume , he explained in a long post that David was nothing more than a pedophile that like to scam arists and harass people on l ine with threats.\n\nLogicly this made me angry , as my wife , who is a professional career artist , has had to deal with annoying creepy choosingbeggars many times before.The post also include a link to a video , but I didn't bother to watch it. This is important later. \n\nBeing the jerk that I am, I decided that I will try to see if I could get some laughs on the expense of this guy , meaning David.\n\nMe and my wife agreed to try and piss him off , you see , David was completely obsessed with his waifu, and one of the things that enraged him the most , was seeing his waifu paired with another character that he hates. So much that even on his profile description he explained that it was physically hurting for him to see drawings of the two being shipped.\n\nSo that's exactly what we drew\n\nI feel like a piece of shit for doing that nowadays.\n\nI made a routine of talking to him about the series we both like in general, always thanking him for liking my drawing and telling him that a new one was on the making , one that it was gonna be much better than the one he already had seen.I never mentioned to him that it was gonna be picture of his waifu and the character he despise kissing passionately. Obviously he was very excited.\n\nWhen the day of uploading the picture arrive I went straight to message him asking for his opinion. To my surprise , he wasn't angry , or even upset.He clearly was displeased, but very calm and polite , he even commented on how he liked the over all look of me and my wife\u00b4s style combined.\n\nBeing a bit confused I decided to prove a little , I ask him if it wasn't that his favorite character, his waifu and if he didn't mind that he was kissing with another character.\n\nHe told me that even if he didn't like the drawing itself , he was trying to keep it down with his obsession with his waifu , as it was bringing him troubles lately. \n\nI keep digging. We started to talk about more personal things , so far we only have talked about the anime series we where both watching, but now I was actually trying to get to know him for real for the first time.\n\nHe explained that he was fully aware of his obsession with his waifu and also with his anime persona , both things that he frequently was trying to commission to different artist. I ask \"What do you mean with \"try\" you just pay an artist and they draw stuff for you\" , I was aware that he was called a scammer before, but I wanted to know his side of the story,he told me that he was having a lot of troubles with a person that was making sure that he was hated nomather where he go , and whenever he landed a commission from an artist, said artist would received a notification , warning him about David , about how he was a scamer, a creep and a pedophile. Said warning will also include the same link to the video I saw early.\n\nDavid begg me not to watch the video , as he didn't wanted another artist , me , to block him. So naturally I watched the video.\n\nI was shocked, it was a compilation of several screenshots that had been taken over the course of years, the video told a very detailed story of a very disturbed person, David had committed so many offences in the past , that im having trouble even now to keep track of all of them. Everything that the person accused David of doing was true. Over the course of several years , David had harassed several artist , in the true choosingbeggar fashion, trying to make them draw his anime persona and his waifu on request. When they asked for a compensation, he explained that he will try to get the money and will keep them posted to when he got it.He then will message the artist repeatedly , reminding them the he was still trying to get the money and to keep a space open because he would be ready to pay in any minute. He will drag this behaviour for moths , obviously annoying several artist in the process , as he was still trying to get freebies along the way all the time  and the occasions in which he actually managed to paid for a commission were very rare.\n\nThen it came the art theft. David has very fond of taking other people's art , drawings that included his waifu, and edit them so they looked like the characters were talking about him. Always praising the relationship between him and his waifu. Obviously a lot of artist complain to him about this. Here's when the threats begin. David will go and explain that it wasn't him who stole the drawings and edit them, it was his friend , a friend that was only trying to make him happy by doing that. Nobody belive him and start demanding that he took the drawings down immediately or he would be reported.This is where his \"friend\" come to defend him. His \"friend\" will always talk using Davids account , always shouting and threating the artist , telling them that if it was so important to them ,he will credit them and even include a link to the original work , but that he will not be taking the defamed pictures down. \n\nAll hell broke loose, there was discussions, yelling and all sorts of commentaries and threats from David that would fitt perfectly on the Iamverybadass sub reddit. This lasted for a very long time , and left a bunch of people enraged with David , and with good reason , please let it be perfectly clear that I understand the the hatred towards him was justified.\n\nNow comes the hard part, the pedophilia and child abuse acusations. \n\nDavid was not also very active on social media, he was also very active on several Discord communities, where his all an all terrible reputation was beginning to spread. It was in discord where he was called out for his biggest offence.\n\nSending porn to a minor.\n\nThe video showed several screenshots of a conversation in which a girl , who clearly stated that was only fifteen , and David , talked over the fact that the girl didn't know what NSFW meant or was.David mentioned that a girl his age should already know what NSFW is because when he was fifteen he already know about the subject, David had around twenty years when this interaction took place , David then proceeded to show the girl a picture of his anime persona having sex with his waifu.This enraged everyone , especially because there has been another recent incident in which David had mentioned that he would like to eat a little girl character because her multicolor hair looked like it tasted fruity. \n\nNow , here is where I normally would have join the ranks of those who hated David.\n\nIf it wasn't for a very important fact that i learn about him. David is on the aspergers spectrum , he confessed this to me when I confronted him with the things that the video show.\n\nAnd I know that is posible that he made up the story about aspergers to cover his butt, but screen shots , posted by the guy issuing the warning about David, show the he was talking about his problems to a lot of people, many of who encourage him into trying to get profesional help.\n\nHe told me he was very sorry about the things he had said and done, but every time he tried to apologise things would escalate again and it ended up worse that it was before.\n\nIt's been years since all of that happen but he still is being paying for what he did. Now, I know that a lot of people would say that he deserves it , he did some horrible things and he needs to be punished. Part of me agrees to that. \n\nThe other part cant stop seeing an immature grown up child that didn't know any better and made some mistakes, and now is trying fix things but doesn't know how because he lacks the social skills.\n\nRecently, and I mean like a few months recently, David was invited to do a podcast to explain his part of the story. But it was more like an ambush. It was clear that the people running the podcast only wanted to humiliate him. They shoute at him, forced to talk about subjects he didnt wanted to talk. They even went as far as to tease him about his deseased fahter. They managed to make him talk about how he had punched his sister in the face after she scratched him when he was seven. And how when he was a teenager , he make out with one of his cousins.\n\nI keep talking to him almost every night. And almost always has bad news. About how he's having troubles at school, he is over twenty now and he hasn't finished high school yet. Or news about how another of his friends has blocked him or that another artist has refused to take his commission. I keep trying to convince him to get of the Internet for a while, to try and let the hatred fade away but he cant, he tells the me that the internet its all he has on his life.\n\nI've talked with a few of the artist that David harass some time ago. They all confirmed that everything is true. They also told me that a lot of people have already tired to help David before. All of them had to give up because David simply refused to change his ways.\n\nThey keep telling me that I shouldn't waste my time. This is starting to be very stressful to me.\n\nToday David told me that he made a mistake and faved a pic on Deviantart , and that the artist immediately block him.I asked if he had done anything, he told me no, he explained that there was a guy that immediately sends any artist a warning regarding David the second he faved or commented on a pic. I asked him to comment on one of my pictures to see what would happen, sure enough, the moment David left a comment , a reply was posted and I received an PM warning me about David and all of the previous stuff he had done. How can they know when he post a comment on a random DA pic? I checked the profile of the person that send the message , there's several people trying like hell to get him black listed everywhere online. One guy even said that he is gathering evidence that David frequents loli hentai websites.I asked David if this was true and he denies everything.\n\nI honestly don't know what to do anymore. Im not the only one trying to help him , I see other people trying to defend David in the coment section of the people acusing him. But everyone goes silent when the pedophilia is mentioned. I really wanna help him, I honestly think that nowadays he is a harmless guy that is just trying to make his way through life the best way he can. But a growing part keeps thinking that maybe I shouldn't be so tolerant with all the stuff he did.\n\nI keep trying to think how would I feel if all that harassment from David back in the day was addressed to me or my wife. I know I probably wouldn't wanna forgive him. My wife also thinks that David is being excesibly mistreated for the \n\nthings he did , but also doesn't want me to get too involved. As she don't wanna jeopardize her DA account , her main source of income.\n\nI'm completely and genuinely lost, I don't know what to do any more. If anyone read through all of that, thank you very much.\n\nAny sort of opinion , commentary or suggestion is welcomed. \n\nAgain , thank you very much for reading.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

The three of us play fighting games every Monday. Here's what's happening.\n\nI LOVE fighting games. Not a super competitive person though. Mostly play just to do cool combos and have fun with some couch matches. Both have been playing longer than I have and it shows on some games. They get concepts and theories and things that I'm still learning to grasp. Even still, there's a hierarchy with them.\n\nMy one friend (M27) really gets the fundamentals and likes to play really grounded fighting games. They're his favorite and he gets them, remembering combos, characters and so on. That being said, he regularly beats my other friend (M23) at these games. I like anime fighters (they're a lot more fun IMO) and practice those instead. Because I don't practice these more grounded fighters, I tend to lose a lot more. My friends take 'friendly' jabs at me, calling me a button masher (though I have since improved) and how they always have to play differently with me. Whenever they talk about me, I'm the butt of their jokes, and they almost always win matches against me.\n\nUntil they play a game I like, that is.\n\nI love Blazblue Cross Tag Battle. Play it a ton. Whenever we play *that* game, I tend to win nearly every match. Even my friend (M27) has a really difficult time when playing against me. When he loses, it's because he relies on his habits formed from his more grounded fighters. I take advantage of that (as you are supposed to do in these types of games). However, when I win, my (M27) friend blames it on the controller not doing what he told it to do, my 'stupid' playstyle, or the characters I use. My other friend (M23) just groans whenever we want to play these games and just says that he doesn't have fun with them. \n\nLook, I get it.\n\nI understand, of course, that we each have our different games that we like to play. Totally understandable. I also get that there will be games that we play where one person (the one that plays more) will have a distinct advantage over the others. However, when I lose, I don't blame the controller, or their character. I blame *me.* I know where I'm falling short and I try to get better. They don't act like this however. And even when my friend (M27) wins, if a character didn't play *exactly* how he thought they would, he complains at how stupid this is, or 'stupid' that is. He gets really salty. He also likes to bring up how the only reason I won was that he made a mistake. Or that I did something stupid and not at all based on skill. An example of this is when my friend tries to apply pressure. Usually wake-up supers are dumb (bc they can be easily punished) but they work on him because he doesn't expect them, which is why I do them. I'm trying to catch them. He just claims I'm throwing out a random super. I tried explaining myself, but I was both ignored and criticized. They didn't believe me and made fun of me, always citing something I said when I first started playing the game. (I said I only throw out random supers when I know they'll work. I should have said when I *think* they'll work. That was my bad.)\n\nFor a long time, I was just thinking that it was just a game thing, but I noticed other things this same friend (M27) has been doing outside of our game time, and they really, really bother me.\n\nI'm a very optimistic person and I always think about the bright side of things. He's very cynical (not pessimistic he claims)  and has a very distinct world view. I'm also very religious, but not judgmental. I love them for who they are and I don't care that they believe differently. I'm very accepting of them. However, I can't bring up anything I like to talk about because it is either shot down, challenged, or outright disregarded. If I'm happy and looking forward to something, I'm immediately told of all the ways that it might not happen, and not get my hopes up. I could be playing a fighting game on my switch that's going to be receiving a new patch and he'll say 'You know that's pretty stupid to play that right? It's going to change once the patch drops.' I don't ask him for advice and yet he feels compelled to give it. I try to find commonality in our conversations, agreeing with bits and pieces that I of course agree with, but it's never mutual. Both my friends do this to me. It's like they're trying to bait me into an argument and then lash out at me when I give an opinion.\n\nI always feel stupid when talking to them to (even though I know I'm an intelligent person) because I can't respond quickly to their arguments or statements. My brain is just hardwired differently. They then act like I'm dumb or didn't think things through before speaking. I get afraid to even open my mouth because they will try to use my own words against me.\n\nI know this all sounds negative, but they genuinely like to see me, and the feeling can be mutual sometimes. I generally enjoy playing with them when they aren't acting like I'm the bottom of the totem pole. We can share really funny jokes (some that aren't at my expense!). Some nights are great, but more frequently, some nights are really bad. I often feel frustrated that they don't understand me and that I'm an emotional punching bag.\n\nMy friend (M27) always has us come over to his house too. He doesn't like going anywhere else because he says he has severe general anxiety and major depression. My other friend (M23) never hosts and often depends on either him or me to help him out with things. He doesn't ever really contribute unless it's joking about me. My friend (M27) is often the one to buy food and do other things, though we don't ask him to (at least I don't). When I offer to help him, he usually gives me an almost disgusted look that I would even ask. He doesn't like taking help from anyone, at least not financially. \n\nGiven the amount of negatives I've given in the wall of text above (again, I'm so sorry for the length!) you're probably thinking 'Why on Earth are you still friends with these people?' The answer is complicated, but I want you all to know that I genuinely love and care about their wellbeing. I don't want to get rid of them, but I do need advice, and maybe even validation. I know they're different from me, and that might be a source of contention. I just don't want to fight them, ya know? Do ya'll think that they're toxic? What would you do?\n\n(PS. I have tried talking to them in the past, but it doesn't really do anything. They are the way they are, for better or worse. I've come to accept that. It doesn't make things any easier, however.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading this massive post. I hope ya'll have a great day :)", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Unfortunately I became a willing participant in that side and now that I realise the cold harsh reality of it all it\u2019s left me a little broken inside. If you\u2019re naive/lack experience when it comes to relationships and have low self-esteem I recommend being extra careful. \n\n\nHaving someone to talk to can be great, but please remember that you don\u2019t owe anyone anything just because they\u2019re nice or they pay you compliments etc. Aim to respond how you would if you knew them in real life. If a situation makes you uncomfortable don\u2019t feel obligated to continue talking. \n\n\nIf you feel like you\u2019re developing romantic feelings, take it slow, things don\u2019t have to move fast, a person\u2019s behaviour online does not necessarily reflect how they are in real life, a lot of the time it\u2019s the idea of a person rather than the person that we begin to desire, try and work out if that\u2019s what you\u2019re experiencing. \n\n\nI know most, if not all of you already know this stuff, and like I said I was willing, it\u2019s easy to get swept up in the fantasy of it all, so I\u2019m not blaming anyone but myself, but I just want people to be aware. I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t reach out and don\u2019t make friends, and who knows you might end up falling in love with someone online and it could work out great! BUT PLEASE BE VERY VERY CAREFUL \ud83d\ude2d\n\n\nSome important points:\n- you DONT need to send pictures/nudes \n- you DONT need to engage in sexual conversation \n- if someone stops talking to you because you don\u2019t want to send pictures or talk about certain things then GOOD RIDDANCE THE TRASH TOOK ITSELF OUT\n\n\nr/Needafriend isn\u2019t a bad place to make friends, like I said you can meet great people, but also know your worth, anyone seeking friendship deserves to meet good friends, not people who\u2019ll try and take advantage of that loneliness. \n\n\nSorry if this kind of post isn\u2019t allowed and if I sound like a crazy person, I really needed to get these thoughts out of my mind and finally just move on from it all. Best of luck to anyone considering posting/responding :)", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

There Is no order to what I am saying it's all just pouring out I guess\n\nI'm an 18-year-old virgin but It dosnt really bother me. It's still young and I have plenty of time. My issue is everyone else my age has at least some experience with their chosen sex. I have never even kissed a girl nor do I think a girl has ever really wanted to kiss me while I was interested in that sort of thing. there was one girl in year 9 I think but at the time I thought high school relationships were pointless and trivial. I still do up to a point but I believe them to be sort of building blocks. steps up to something more real and a way to gain some confidence. there was one time that I could have kissed a girl but it was during a dare game and there were friends around. she was very pretty and someone I had known for some time but I was utterly convinced I would have just embarrassed myself. I didn't fancy her but I can recognise a gorgeous girl. My point is that I'm stuck in a loop. I am terribly desperate for a relationship but don't feel like I can get one. It's especially soul-crushing for me because while others dream of being balls to the wall rich i dream of being married and having a couple of kids and have wanted this since I was 16. I have tried dating apps but most people on there only want a shag and if a girl kicked e out of her house the morning after I would be liable to end my life when i got home. I do think about suicide a lot. I'm not looking for any sort of assurences that life is worth living because we all know that while that can be true most of the time it barely is. I was very tempted while i was in college (17) but the idea of doing that to my family made me cut off that line of thought quite quickly. although that is a strange dynamic in my mind. I don't really carer what any of them think, I want to because they are my family, I have had dreams where they die and wake up feeling nothing. I first went to college alone. I had no friends and mostly didn't talk to anyone while I was there. I took a month to drop out and move to a new school with friends and it was likely the worst month of my life. it was around that time though that I started becoming numb to other people and myself in a way. I slowly stopped feeling things and eventually just became sort of blank. I cut of my friends and started eating lunch and spending my breaks in the library reading thats when the blankness gave way to sadness and near-constant loneliness. I tried filling the hole by becoming reacquainted with my friends. It was at this point they asked why i hadn't eaten with them in a month. And every time I spoke to any of them i got really antsy and anxious I struggled to think. eventually, I started skipping classes to read in the library spending almost full days in there or just on the bus going nowhere. This of course lead tomy being kicked out of school which didn't help my situation at home. I have a decent relationship with my parents but I currently barely say 10 words to my dad a day and it was at this time that i could tell every time he looked at me was disappointed, lately its like everytime I try o speak to either of them its all to loud and all i want to do is leave. It would make me sad every time I saw that but only because it just reminded me of the pit I have shoved myself into. Another issue is that I know that I'm bright and have been told as such but sometimes it's like my head get a little fuzzy and I can only focus on one thing which is never what I need to focus on. It's really annoying, especially when under pressure. I actually have only spoken with family and the people  I work with for over a year and a half and while I feel no need to change I desperately want to. It's hard to explain my mindset but this is the best I think i can do. I am currently in full-time work but only saving up all of my money for a house and I'm quite proud of it. work is actually one of the things that spurred this post on. I cae home in a terrible mood because a coworker had just told me exactly what he thought of me. I make a lot of jokes at work, I am not sure why but I think it is because I have always tried to make people laugh and just because I struggle to be happy dosnt mean I should stop, But apparently this equates to an ego but that isn't really what bothers me. his constant reference to me age is what got on my nerves. like everything he was saying was correct because he had been alive longer than me. he even had the fucking nerve to call me a kid. a kid to me is someone who hasn't been through anything in my opinion. I have seen my mum black and blue and have had to go to primary school and make excuses to my friends that no thery cant come round to my house because it's messy and we are decorating. I have been play fighting with my mother and all of a sudden she has gone into a panic attack and wet herself because for one moment I reminded her of the man who tried to choke her to death. He said he was trying to act professional while laying me out in front of several people who I had been attempting to form some sort of friendship with and because of the stupid way emotions work I don't even know if I'll care on Monday. It's not as if he couldn't have asked for a private word at least that way we could have had a mature conversation. maybe then I wouldn't have been contemplating throwing myself into the canal on the ride home and just holding on to bike until I can't anymore. I have also just got of of the phone with my sister and she is madat me because I am going to miss an opening for some of her art. It's not as if all I have done is support her since she started and gone to see other places she sells it. Its 2 hours to get there and 2 hours back and it will cost 20 quid in travel alone, not to mention the food and drink that will cost a bomb. It's on the side of a beer can for fucks sake and forgive me for wanting my Saturday when I feel like i haven't slept right for 2 years. But I'm the terrible brother even though you just threw this at me and 1:30 on a Saturday.\n\nSelf-harm has never really been appetizing, I want to end my life but preferably in the least painful way possible. I don't want to feel the life leaving my body I just want it to end. But I also know that people wouldn't want to see my dead body or at least see me die. Its why I have no sympathy for people who throw themselves into traffic or some shit. That driver has to live on with that while you're not even alive for them to be angry at and I can't imagine the effect that could have on a person. I'm digressing from my main point here. I feel I have a lack of capacity to love but love is all I want from life and I have no clue how to get it. I think that I could treat a woman right because lord knows she would be all I have. But I am also worried that I would get bored of her like I got bored of every other person in my life, well except maybe my sister but even that is starting to dwindle. I now realize that this is just a place for me to vent and maybe figure a few things out. I am tempted not to post this but maybe someone out there will see this and think themselves in a similar position or in perspective on not as bad and it will make them feel less alone. Maybe I'll do this more often as I do often struggle to fully grasp my own thoughts but writing them down like this has helped a bit.\n\nEdit: I'd like to add that I don't think that some girl will swoop in and save my life and i actually have quite low expectations of what my first relationship will be like. I don't belive in a perfect romance", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

When we went to SF we were in a hotel room by ourselves, we were both single and nothing happened between us. when i was in vegas with her we had a house to ourselves we even got in the jacuzzi lol, i remember when night came i was watching TV and i was sitting on her bed \" not in a sexual manner or expecting anything'  and she stood there out of the shower asking me to get off bc she wanted to knock out, i would have thought that she would have taken full advantage of the situation or something but she didn't, when we went to cancun it was basically the same type of stuff.  i wasn't begging for it i made her feel comfortable enough to get at me but she never did. So id feel safe enough to say that its not because  i have a girlfriend, she has had her bfs in the past she wasn't waiting on me n i wasn't waiting on her.\n\ni know there have been times i have failed her one i can remember was when we were in cancun and i didnt want to go out clubbing for her bday bc it just wasn't me,, one of her friends told me that she was crying that day..i honestly feel like a huge dick for doing that...it was her day and she invited me to cancun.. it wasn't my time to be all picky.. even if she wanted to do something i hated,i told her about it i asked her to forgive me and she did  i feel bad even to this day about it.\n\nas far as this year we are both in relationships and it's not the first time we are.We  really haven't seen each other that much she came over for my bday bash  in feb but that's it, i have invited her about 4 times  i have called her and she always tells me she's busy or working and cant come. she invited me back in july for her bday bash in palm spring \"we are from LA for all you identity thefts lol\" she told me she canceled and was going to vegas,,, but didnt even ask if i wanted to come.\n\nid hate to lose her i don't wanna be dramatic ether. i feel like confronting her  and asking her why she just disappeared . i am scared because i would be sticking my neck out, i don't want to make her feel like i'm putting her in a pedestal  just so she can attack me and belittle me, i would like to have a adult and open conversation but i don't know i think that it would be possible.\n\nit has happened in the past 'that she bilittle me or disrespect me'' and not because i felt like i was losing her friendship but because id do something dumb i would do and she would be super critical. ex..she was making fun of me when we were in the subway and laughing telling me that i'm a idiot, id get to the point where i feel like asking her if i was her friend..bc i dont treat dogs like that..\n\nALL IN ALL what should i do should i block her from my accounts and block her number forget about her all together?\n\n should i confront her and try to work it out if there is anything to work out?// she might just be busy i doubt it.\n\nher bday is  this weekend should i call her??idk\n\nTHIS IS THE LONGEST REDDIT POST I HAVE EVER HAD NOTHING EVEN COMES CLOSE but thank you if you made it to the end and id appreciate any advice", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I saw him as my dad so this wasn\u2019t initially problematic. Well, me and my stepdad got into a rather nasty argument and he forced me to call my mum or my bio dad and get them to come get me because I was no longer welcome to stay with him. I was distraught and called my mum who dropped what she was doing and drove an over an hour to come and get me. From that day forward, my whole stepfamily cut me out completely and I barely had a relationship with my brothers. \n\nI moved in with my mum, changed schools and started a new life basically at 12/13. Within 6 months, my mum had met someone and they\u2019d been dating around 6/7 weeks when she moved him in with us. He was fine at first but then he started causing problem between myself and my mum. Real nasty arguments, unusual punishments and being grounded for pretty much 2 years of my teenage life was the new normal. I had friends and a boyfriend at school who didn\u2019t believe me when I told them about all of this. It was so severe, he smashed my phone with a hammer after I had an argument about the fact I was grounded all the time. He used to steal things from my room, hide food from me, got locks out on all the  doors so I couldn\u2019t go anywhere but my room, the kitchen and the bathroom. They stopped feeding me, washing my clothes etc but would never teach me how to do it myself. They found out I was smoking and so they grounded me more. In the end, I was grounded for 3 1/2 years.\n\nMy best friend in the entire world was Lily (fake name) and she believed me. She would see how I never had eaten lunch or my clothes weren\u2019t being washed, I was gaunt, never did my homework, never replied to emails, texts, phone calls etc. I even took my phone that had been obliterated in to show her. She offered for me to come and live with her and her family. One night after they had stripped my room out, leaving me a bed, my school books and school clothes. I\u2019d had enough. I started a massive argument with my mum and her boyfriend and eventually kicked their bedroom door so hard that it broke and all my stuff was laying in boxes in their room. Seeing this as an opportunity to grab things and run away, I grabbed the box filled with all my precious things- ornaments from dead relatives and people I didn\u2019t see often, keepsakes from childhood, pictures in frames... I got it into my room and her boyfriend came charging in after me, screaming at me. He grabbed the box and launched it at me, everything broke beyond repair. By this point, I\u2019d shut off emotionally. When he\u2019d finished threatening me and screaming in my face, he left and my mum came in. I told her flatly that it was me or him. She laughed and told me to stop being stupid. I repeated that if he didn\u2019t go, I would. So she left me in my room. \n\nI called Lily and she and her family immediately sprung to my aid. They picked me up and all my stuff and I went to live with them. I was in my last year before going to college so they helped me get my GCSE\u2019s and when summer came, I decided to go and holiday at my bio dads mums. So I\u2019m a week into my holiday and I get a message from Lily telling me to come get my stuff. She didn\u2019t want me living with her anymore and quickly, my boyfriend broke up with me and she started dating him. She told me her dad didn\u2019t like me living there and that she\u2019d leave my stuff outside for me to come and get. When we went to get it, she\u2019d emptied a cigarette tray into it, leaving most of my clothes ruined. I was heartbroken and told her she was a shit friend and cut off all contact with her. My dads mum ended up telling me I could stay with her as my dad didn\u2019t want me living with him and his wife but she would constantly threaten to take me back to live with my mum. I wanted to get away from all my family so I met someone at 17 and moved out as soon as I could as we\u2019re happily married with a mortgage and a baby. \n\nFast forward to now, I\u2019m married, had a baby, have a mortgage and Lily pops up and congratulated me. I say thank you, we have a little chat and all seems to be smoothed over. A few months later, she announces she pregnant so I sent a little gift for the baby and said \u201cmotherhood is hard, always here if you need to talk.\u201d \n\nShe\u2019s just invited me to her wedding next year and I\u2019m lost at what to do. I don\u2019t know whether to go or to leave the past behind? It\u2019s cutting me up because she was my best friend in the whole world. But due to my past, this felt like a huge betrayal from her and I\u2019ve never had a decent friend since. Reddit; what do I do?", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Norwegian, by the way, if that matters at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI seem to go best together with people who share some of my interests, so I'll list them up here. I'm going to try to not elaborate too much, but if you're curious, please say so and I'll serve you up a nice wall of text :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Japan and East Asia**: I've been learning Japanese for almost 8 years now, and all the while I've also spent some time studying Chinese (Mandarin and some Cantonese) and Korean on the side. This (studying East Asian languages) is my biggest interest by far. I watch dramas and anime, read (or try to read, in the case of Chinese and Korean) manga and books, and I also listen to quite a lot of music in these languages (lately I've been getting really into vocaloid music again). I also follow news in the region casually (I watch 1 Japanese show that's aired on YouTube, and that's it really haha).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Linguistics and language learning**: More generally, I also enjoy learning other languages than those of East Asia. In school, I learnt German to an intermediate level, and I've tried my hand at quite a few languages, if only to nibble at them a bit. Examples include Arabic, Russian, Irish Gaelic, Welsh and Finnish. Also, I would classify myself as a very amateur linguist, and I think it's a cool field of study. Actually, my fields of study within Japanese studies are Japanese linguistics and Japanese language history!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Gaming**: Before starting to learn languages at the tender age of 17, my main hobby was gaming (mainly PC). I no longer play as much as I did, but I still follow gaming podcasts like Dropped Frames and the Co-Optional podcast, and I finished the last DLC for Darks Souls 2 not long ago, so I do play, but due to time restrictions and my PC being totally potato town, it's nowhere near to the degree I did before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Worldbuilding/Writing**: I worldbuild from time to time, including of course conlanging, browsing r/worldbuilding and r/conlangs at times to get inspiration or to check out cool shit. I usually start working on a project with incredible passion, then burn out quickly as I have to tend to other responsibilites/interests, so I've got quite little to show for my time spent, but I still think it's a cool activity. I also try my hand at writing stories from time to time, but, as with my worldbuilding, I never keep at it for long and usually it's simply for the sweet, sweet escapism.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Music**: I spend so much time listening to music - it's the best. As I said above, I listen to a ton of East Asian music (usually electronic or popular music). Before I got interested in East Asia, though, throughout my teens, I listened a lot to metal, with my interests kind of going like this: thrash metal (Metallica, Kreator etc.) -&gt; melodic death metal (Amon Amarth, Insomnium etc.) -&gt; progressive (death) metal (Opeth, Leprous etc.). I still listen to it, but not nearly as much as I did before. I also play a bit of guitar. My father's side of the family is really quite musically gifted, so I guess I got the interest and some talent from them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **YouTube/Twitch**: I watch too much YouTube... It's a problem, really. I watch mostly gaming-related videos/streams, though a lot of them are really glorified podcasts haha. As an example, I watch a lot of Yogscast videos/streams. I also watch some Japanese YTers like \u30ec\u30c8\u30eb\u30c8 (retoruto; game videos) and \u304b\u304a\u308b (Kaoru; videos about Korea).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **GoT**: Just added this because I've been reading all the ASoIaF-books recently, being almost midway through *A Dance with Dragons* part 1 at the time of writing, and it's the shit! I never watched a single episode of the show, wanting to read the books first, and that I wasn't able to do before this summer, so I've had to suffer some spoils over the years, but all in all I've been lucky to dodge most of them :) Kinda crap knowing that people hated the ending of the show for when I'm going to watch it myself, but I guess it can't be helped.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

It has been reported, my mother and father also divorced when I was born, and in an attempt to keep the family somewhat together, I didn't tell the investigator what my dad asked of me. Keep in mind, I did want justice and I deeply regret knowing that he isn't incarcerated for the main and simple reason that he could be doing the same to other minors. Anyways, my aunt, whom I was extremely close to and admired even, seemed to not believe me. I remember distinctly how my brother, mother, aunt and I went to his house when he wasn't present there, we gathered our possessions and my aunt told me to never get rid of the possessions my father bought me. She said, \"Whatever crooked thing he did or didn't do to you, he still loves you very much.\" \n\nOn topic with the question, I'm currently in a situation where I'm losing my best friends in highschool, due to drama. I didn't initially start the drama but I left the friend group because of how one of the ex best friends I have, starts drama and is very toxic, not to mention, I dated her best friend who I'm also not friends with. That's a topic for another day, anyways, they've been spreading false rumors at school saying how my best friend is a hoe, (yet the toxic one is dating my other ex who attends the school, she dated him last year and is currently dating him now), and my ex is stalking my best friend. Due to the constant drama, I asked my best friend if I could out them (not in a discriminatory way, but rather a way for showing others who they really are). She gave me permission to do so and I re-editted the post on my Snapchat, to which she replied, \"Leave them alone.\"\n\nShe explained that she made a truce with them and I asked if she was still going to be friends with them. She said she was going to be acquaintances, I got mad over the fact that she let me do it but then wants to defend them. I didn't threaten them at all and in our argument she told me to, \"Put yourself in their shoes.\" I told her, \"I would if they put themselves in mine.\" I proceeded to explain to her that I'm always willing to help them with their issues, but the problem is, whenever I tell them my issues, they downgrade them and say, \"You act like you're the only ones with problems.\" I'm aware that others have problems and that no one has the time to constantly try to help me, I don't ask that of them, I just ask to get advice but neither of them know what to say.\n\nAs for my best friend, she told me to do whatever I want, that she doesn't care anymore as long as I don't include her name in it. I'm ashamed to let this affect my mental health, I'm someone who struggles with depression, BPD, anxiety, as well as ADHD. My question is, is it my fault? Was I in the wrong?

Grab a cup of tea, sit back and relax as this might be a long one :)\n\n(Before I get to \"me\"...) I realize making meaningful friendships in your 30's is hard, especially over the internet! Yet, I hope making  a \"genuine friend\" is STILL possible in today's world! Friends come in all shapes and sizes and it's hard to list all the qualities an individual should possess that makes them a great friend! I'd rather list what I miss about having a friend and seeing if you feel the same \\~\n\nI miss talking about the most amazing, random or mundane things we've done that day, discussing silly conspiracies or the paranormal, sending pictures of my quirky dogs, meme-ing randomly, playing games, commenting on our fashion sense, indulging our hobbies, building our goals up and helping each other tackle and grow in life... If any of those hit a heart-string then maybe a friendship is in the works!\n\n(A Realistic About Me)...

Is very empathetic and sentimental, I love a good romance and helping people is kind of my life's ambition.\n5. Has an unhealthy obsession to dogs, lord of the rings, collecting stationary and baking sweeties.\n6. Has a tendency to want to solve people's problems, see the best in them, help them grow, listen etc.\n7. Feels like relationships are all about giving and receiving the same amount, I give you 50, you give me 50 :)\n\nMeeting a friend over the internet is seriously a very strange process lol It's hard to get a true sense of a person through the computer, so I'd like to propose we spend time naturally getting to know each other and actually \"TALK\" honestly about whether we work or not. I don't want to ghost anyone (or be ghosted) or feel guilty about deleting someone off my Facebook because we don't talk anymore. This might be a bit of a hard process, but if you're committed then I am too :)\n\nI really miss having a female friend, but I'm not opposed to a male friend as long as he understands I'm married (no kids).I'd love someone a little closer to my age as my idea of fun is literally making tea, moaning about my bad knee and getting into bed with my dog haha!

She was the first person that I felt completely comfortable with so she meant a great deal to me and I loved/love her very much. For most of my life, I\u2019m 22, it\u2019s been chaotic. My parents were young when they had me, lots of instability in their relationship, my maternal grandparents were alcoholics (happily, they\u2019ve sobered up and are no longer), infidelity in their marriage, CPS was called once when I was 12, I thought it was discipline until an incident crossed the line. Recently, in my young adult life,  my great grandmother passed, my uncle tried to take his life, my mom was diagnosed with PTSD and DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder), my cousins were almost taken away from their parents. To sum it up, this is an inkling of what has happened thus far.\n\nIn high school, I opened up to her about EVERYTHING that affected me physically, emotionally and mentally. Not all at once, but slowly as I grew more comfortable. And she became my rock, someone I felt safe with.\nIt was like this until we were 19, I started to meet new people and I fell off the face of the map for her. It lasted close to two years? Then we reconnected last summer, June of 2018. \nThings weren\u2019t totally different, just not the same. Which is expected with time, things change. We got on, we moved in together, moved out with my partner.\n\nNow, prior to me moving out, things started to change or I noticed things have changed. She and her partner have been together for 4 years, she loves him very much and pretty much would do anything for him. When he moved across the state, (we were 19-20?) she moved into a city two hours away from where he lived. Eventually, they both moved back, got a place together, and so on. They would openly talk about marrying one other so then, it was just a fact that they would. But nothing really happened, it didn\u2019t seem like he had the intention to propose until she decided to covert to being a Mormon; I should specify that her partner grew up/was raised Mormon, so naturally it had affect on their relationship. Anyways, I was surprised because years prior, she would\u2019ve never considered converting. Although I didn\u2019t entirely agree, it\u2019s not my life so I still supported her, I asked questions, inquired about her thoughts and feelings through it all. Things seemed fine and I moved out. Shortly after, I invited both of them to my new place for dinner so I could thank them for everything and apologize if I caused any inconvenience.. No reply. I figured, they\u2019re busy, they\u2019ll get back, and still no reply. They got engaged in September, I congratulated her and she replied, \u201cThank you!\u201d I asked how he proposed and how she felt, etc. and left on read. She got married today. \n\nI was hurt, sad, angry, confused, etc. and reacted out of it. I unfollowed/unfriended/blocked her on all socials. I figured since I wasn\u2019t important enough, she no longer deserved to see my life. What a millennial thing, ha. Now though, I\u2019m reconsidering everything. I want to send her a text to tell her congrats and wish the best for her and her husband. Or should I wait and tell her that I\u2019m happy for her and although I wasn\u2019t present, I wish the best and understand that this may be the end of road? Or should I even send a text at all? Or unblock her? What can I do to move forward from this? \n\n\nTLDR; best friend of 5 years got married today and didn\u2019t tell me or invite me. very hurt and sad, blocked her on socials. what should i do? unblock? send a text? wait to text? or should i do anything at all?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We have been super close for almost 5 years. She has this other friend named Derek. So Derek has always been this guy who always puts the moves on people and tried to bang everyone. He even did it to me and 2 other mutual friends. So Derek has always had this supposed crush on Chantal and we all know. He although talks about all these girls he gets right in front of Chantal. Once he came to spend the night at Chantal's house and asked her out over and over again while on the phone trying to hook up with girls. It's been nearly 2 months since then and Chantal fell for him. She always says he's changed and everything but I know he hasn't.\nYesterday I went to her house to have a sleepover with Derek and Chantal. She's kinda young with a very strict mom. She just told me although that she let him finger her, kiss her, grope her. We made her blow him and jerk him. The whole night, they cuddled and he basically humped her and groped her the whole night. Also the whole time I'm there I feel so awkward and out of place. So later that night she takes out a air mattress and it's pretty big too but Derek takes the whole thing basically and it's so weird to sleep next to him. Chantal sleeps on this high raised bed with stairs to go up and I have nowhere else to sleep so I slept on the stairs. She offered me to sleep in her bed but if I did she'd sleep with him and it's the last thing I want her to do. So they both fell asleep, apart, and it was close to 2 a.m. when they passed out. I sat awake, thinking of how bad I feel, until it was nearly 7 a.m. My mom come to the house quickly that morning and I left as fast as possible because it felt so weird!\nIt's now the next night and I decided to send her this note I made at her house, saying how weird it felt and it slowly went to he conversation of me yelling that she will get her heart broken, she will hate herself for doing what she did with him and I said that all she will be is a object for him if she stays. She said that she is sorry I hate them together and was disappointed that I think of all of that but I know it will happen. She will get hurt... I decided I'm not speaking to her until she realizes what will happen and how hurt she'll end up. I told her too that I won't be there to comfort her this time and that I'm done with trying to help... Now I feel so weird with it all... We've gotten into fights before that made us not talk for at most 2 weeks but now... I feel like this will be the end of it for us... So... After hearing it all... Am I a bad friend?

I'm not entirely sure what to say, but I would like to find a friend that I can *cuddle up and talk about nothing with.* I want to form a **lasting connection** with someone, I want...**^(a true friendship.)** \n\nSo, a little about me: \n\nI'm goofy, sometimes wild, very open with my life experiences, shy, an ambivert, open minded, nonjudgmental. ~~(it's so hard to think of interesting ways to describe yourself!)~~ I really like cats, got two of them myself and their names are James and Pepper. I like to read awful books, like those free gay romance kindle books...you know the ones I'm talking about? Um, I like to play video games..PC mostly! Oh! a fun way we can get to know each other is maybe chat and play something together. I'm terrible at FPS shooters, but gimme some of that Stardew Valley action and I'm ya girl hahaha. I currently work at a call center and live with my soon-to-be ex husband. I suffer from some mental illnesses and am working on not letting that get in the way with life, which is a hard battle. Like, the hardest boss battle you can think of! I also tend to ramble!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I would prefer if the person that reaches out to me is close to my age as I can be a little 18+ with my conversations.

What did I expect? I guess I wanted them to immediately befriend me again and imagined everything would be just like in 2012 again!! Right? Well, as it turns out everyone else has moved on with their lives, made tons of new friends and is now travelling through Norway or India with them - so, my bad.\nI'm not a people person, I dislike parties and crowds but for years I've kept telling myself that I really hate everyone else which, however, is most definitely not true but only an excuse for my loneliness. So twice a year, when I actually feel like socializing, I make a post on reddit...\n\nI'm an INTJ and HSP (highly sensitive person); I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for years and I'm going to start seeing a therapist again next week. I usually have an excellent long-term memory which is simultaneously a blessing and a curse.\nBasically I have no family except for my mum - something that has caused various personal issues ever since my childhood. \nI hope to talk to people who have experienced similar struggles and/or share some of my interests:\n\nI study linguistics and phonetics and work as a student assistant at uni. I also volunteer as editor in chief of a youth magazine. Consequently, I'm interested in all aspects of language as well as in journalism. Other topics that I'm interested in include politics, history, different cultures, mythology, psychology, neuroscience, watching football (the European kind), good food and sneakers (though I have no money to buy some new ones).\n\nBesides juggling which I love to do, I mostly spend my free time on the internet or reading books (about any genre, favourite authors include Kafka, Sartre, Neil Gaiman and Douglas Adams and I gotta say that I still adore HP), watching TV shows (some of my faves are Doctor Who, Sherlock, Stranger Things, Lost, House M.D., The End of the F***ing World, ...) and listening to music \n(https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1iueAxHHCnAXMgzX2FlkyI?si=vPfXChMjR7emWlEjEa7ewQ)\nI like to escape into fictional universes and I'm extremely attached to some fictional characters. I'm also always open to book, music and show recommendations! \n\n((I have to say that I'm not into video games and mangas/anime so if these are your main interests you should know that this isn't something we have in common.))\n\nI'd prefer to talk to people my age ( ~ 17-25) but if you're out of that age group and have sth really interesting to say, go ahead. \nI love receiving long messages and people who are avid readers!\nI'd also like to encourage all girls to talk to me since you don't get many messages from fellow females on here :)", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

So we finished the project and me and another guy decided to cheat a few items and put them in hidden chests because we are starting survival soon. Another guy found out about the hidden chests and he started trolling us. My best friend (owner) joined the server, he saw everything and he got really mad. He started blaming me for everything. He said I am dumbass idiot, piece of sh\\*t, etc.. \"Is there a game you are good at without cheats?\" Well yeah. I've played a lot of games with him and I am better than him in every game except minecraft lol, but I did not want to tell him that. So now he blocked me everywhere. I can't contact him anywhere.

Im really empathetic, so when this happens I usually end up apologizing for misinterpretation or searching my head for my own behaviors that might make her feel like she has to act that way.

Loving Link's Awakening atm and looking forward to FF7, Last Of Us 2, Xenoblade remake\n\nLove reading- I look at scientific and psychology articles now and then, like fiction too, currently, slowly, reading through the Hobbit\n\nTraveller- my close friends go on road trips monthly. Absolutely my favourite hobby.\n\nFitness - massively into gym, have done martial arts too\n\nTV - my fav TV shows are Breaking Bad and Death Note. I enjoy anime, not my fav thing, but it's good. Black Mirror, Titans, B99, all excellent TV shows\n\nCulture- actually went to Hyper Japan for example, really was nice to appreciate another culture and history. Museums and so forth are my natural habitats haha\n\nWell.

But that's not what I'm here for, I'm here for just talking to people, maybe talking about our obsessions because right now I have no once else who loves Gentleman Jack and Swan Queen and musicals so if you're into those things please, for the love of God, TALK TO ME.  \n\n\nI'm not religious but I think the idea of having a God is very cool.  \nI recently read that the ten plagues were actually proven to be real. Pretty neat.  \nAlso the idea of God is nice to me because I've always just kind of seen him as this sweet old grandpa (or grandma) being like 'Oh sweet child', like basically a Santa but an allmighty Santa who is incredibly wise but also has your back.  \nHonestly I don't know what I believe but I like that idea.  \nI love artsy things but I'm never good at actually finishing things so during high school I kind of just stopped making stuff, like drawing, playing piano... I recently got a new keyboard because I kind of missed playing piano so sometimes I play a silly tune. Sometimes I make silly scribbles but no real art. I sometimes write and I like reading but only when they book is good enough for me to finish it, because for some reason I get easily bored with books (which is why fanfiction exists).\n\nI like music. My favorites are Tegan and Sara, Hayley Kiyoko, Pink, Todrick Hall, Halsey, Elton John and a lot of showtunes.  \nMy favorite musicals at the moment are the Book of Mormon, Heathers, Mean Girls, Six, Everybody's Talking About Jaimie, Dear Evan Hansen and Hamilton.\n\nI'm pretty awfully awkward, very introverted although I need to be surrounded by my family for some reason. I don't like being alone but I also don't like being surrounded bu lots of unfamiliar people. Just my family.   \nI have social anxiety but I feel like in the last two years I've grown a lot when it comes to that, because in the first year I started the study COmmunication and everyone was super extraverted and I didn't fit in at ALL (our group especially was the loudest) but I feel like it helped me a little bit, and last year I worked as a temporary at all kinds of different locations with different people, which was scary at first but I've grown quite used to it, and some locations I regularly work at now so it's easier talking to those people.\n\nOh and right now I study psychology. It's my first year and for now I still like it a lot, although it is.. a LOT. But it's all very interesting so I think I might have found the right study for me.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I have waited tables before and know it is an honorable and important job as people trust you to enhance a experience that they choose to spend their time and money on.\n\nAnyway, the issue is that my unemployment has been discontinued due to to something I might have proven with an email that was originally mine.

I asked friend to ask her friend for a copy of the email as it was a group message from our supervisor. My friend \"wasn't comfortable\" asking her friend. After a week of exchanging texts to discuss it, the bottom line is that my friend \"did not want to get involved in case she needed our former employer for a reference. She said it was my battle and I needed to handle it on my own.\" I felt betrayed as now I have zero income until I can get another job.\n\nBottom line is that I overestimated her level of commitment to and loyalty to me and our friendship.

Various hobbies, tell me all about them!\n\nI\u2019m a great listener and am available most times, so you won\u2019t be waiting for days for a response from me.\n\nAnd if you help me in Europe, I\u2019d be open to help you in the states if you ever come down here!

Right now I have an ambition of learning Italian, German and writing a specific history of philosophy book \n\nCurrently I'm reading/researching anti consumerist Marxist books, society of the spectacle by guy debord has been right up aly. And I do also like fiction, books like glorious nemesis and Mr Kafka by hrabal. \n\nMost of the philosophy I read is in the pessimism, Marxist and critical category, but I am open to discussing philosophies in general!  The book I most treasure is Persuasion and Rhetoric by Carlo michelstaedter. I believe it is the most unique book of the 20th century. \n\nI admit, I don't do a lot of writing but it's because I feel there's a lot I have the need to read first, still I have written in small intense bursts. \n\nI am trying to adopt asceticism into my life, something I am a very big fan of, trying to be as less of a consumer as possible. \n\nI'd describe myself as an very open person, I don't build attachments very quickly, I value empathy, I always expect the worst and I try to do different things to break away from the monotonous daily life. I also do play games sometimes and I am open to voice chats too, I am very active on discord and good-reads if that counts as a social platform. \nYou don't have to have political discussions, or anything of the sort, if any of our interests hit up, we'll just talk about that!

Also this person is my only friend.\n\nI've had enough of people judging me for what I like, yet I don't want to end up with no friends. I've tried to keep these conversations civil too - Like whenever the person says they don't like what I do and rant about why it sucks and why I should also hate it, I say I respect their opinion because I want to be nice or change the subject to something a little more light hearted.\n\nI try to understand their point of view, but they never try to understand mine. I did address this to them once earlier and said \"How would you feel if I did this to you? If I disrespected everything you said you felt passionately about?\" But even then they still ridicule me on how my favourite actors suck, or how my favourite movies are all awful.\n\nHonestly, I don't want to end years of friendship over this, but it's really eating away at me as a fan fic writer/video editor. This person constantly puts down the things I like, and in turn I feel less motivated to write or edit, thinking that it's stupid, that people will judge me for it because my only friend does.\n\nWhat's worse is they expect me to eat up their opinion like it's not hurtful, they expect me to agree with them and not argue back, because when I do, they get mad and tell me I shouldn't like the thing we're talking about because they don't, as if their opinion is the only opinion that matters in this friendship.\n\nWe've been friends for about 3 years, but this hasn't happened until now. All of a sudden our interests are clashing and it's making me feel more negative than I have in years, yet this person is all I have when it comes to a social life.\n\nI know my 'obsessions' are the reasons why I don't have friends, but I don't understand why it's such an issue. There's so many people on Tumblr or Reddit etc that like the same actors I do, that write fan fic about the same people/characters, yet my friends refuse to believe that they're anything to be acknowledged.\n\nI say \"It's ok to not like this guy, but I do. You know this.\"\n\nThey say \"Yeah, but he's still the worst thing about this movie and shouldn't be in it.\"\n\nHonestly, this person KNOWS how much I love specific actors and the movies they're in/the people they portray, and yet they still choose to come at me head on and say they're terrible characters/actors who ruin the movie.\n\nLike, I'd understand if you said the movie was crap, but the actor YOU KNOW I like? You know that this thing that brings me happiness when nothing else does, yet you STILL choose to defile it in front of my face. If I didn't write fan fic or make videos about them, I wouldn't be pissed, but no, so here we are. \n\nI'm so conflicted.\n\nAt the moment, I only have two options: I either keep this side of me private, although it's basically who I am, or I have to ditch my passion altogether just to please this person who always thinks their opinion is the BEST opinion.\n\nSome of you might be reading this and thinking I'm over sensitive, and yeah fine maybe I am.\n\nBut these actor obsessions I have are there for good, personal reasons, not creepy reasons. Like some of the characters they play, I can either really relate to them or they just do a REALLY good job in acting out the parts.\n\nEither way, my 'friend' disagrees with everything I say/praise about the actors. They always have to come back at me with something to ruin my mood.\n\nNow, thanks to them, I'm no longer motivated to do the things I normally do: Write a cool fic about my favourite character or edit a quick lil video of them to make myself happy. Because they're the only things that make me happy anymore as I suffer with depression; another reason why all my 'friends' left.\n\nYo, if anything, I just want to know that I'm not alone, and that it's ok to like actors regardless of who they play or how they play them, that it's ok to write fan fic, that it's ok to make short video edits of them, because that's what makes me happy.\n\nI know everyone's entitled to their own opinion, and I've told this person that, but enough is enough. They've ridiculed me too many times about these things, and sometimes I just want to scream for them to stop even though it'll hurt their feelings and they'll turn on me and start accusing me of all sorts - Cause that's what this person will do seeing as they're so defensive.\n\nBut how would they like it if I just turned on them and said I didn't like their favourite movies or actors? Surely they'd feel as disheartened as me.\n\nDoes this person lack empathy or something, I'm not quite sure...\n\nI just feel really alone right now and didn't know where else to come. After all, they're my only friend and I can't exactly discuss this with them without starting something awful, something I wouldn't normally want to do...\n\nBut I'm starting to feel like I have no choice, that I have to lose my remaining friend.\n\nCause when I used to look at a picture of my fave actor, I'd feel happy and content knowing that they're out there doing good movies, being a good person.\n\nBut now, when I look at them, I feel shame. I say to myself \"I shouldn't like this person, cause my friend will get mad at me when I talk about them.\" And deep down, I know that's not a correct thing to feel about something you're passionate about.\n\nYour friends shouldn't belittle you. And I need to know I'm right.\n\nWhen I get my responses, I'll show them to my friend. Maybe then they'll learn to at least keep their opinions elsewhere, if not to themselves.\n\nI just can't deal with the sadness anymore. I want to love my favourite actors without judgement. I want to write and edit without feeling guilty, without feeling like I have to hide it from everyone.\n\nWhy can't people just like what I do? Why can't they accept me?\n\nOk, this has turned into a long depressing rant about myself...sorry. \n\nIt's just sometimes I feel like the only person who has mean friends.\n\nEveryone else gets along great, then there's me, sad and alone writing fan fic by herself cause she has nowhere else to go, and no one to speak to about how much I love certain movies/actors...cause they never share my opinion. They only tell me it's creepy to like them, that I should like what they like instead.\n\nAs much as I've had enough of people putting down my faves, I'm gonna go cry about it now. I literally can't look at my work (videos and fics that I've spent 2 years doing now) without feeling creepy about it, feeling creepy about liking what I like. \n\nI'll often just stare at a picture of my favourite actor and tear up a little, realising that my friend has ruined my image of this actor, that they've gone and made me feel weird about being HAPPY to watch this actor in movies.\n\nCan't even like a movie anymore without them saying \"I HATED THAT MOVIE, IT WAS THE WORST, WHY DO YOU LIKE IT? IT SUCKED!\"\n\nI can't mention my faves to them anymore, cause I know what'll happen if I do.\n\nThey'll say they hate them, I'll say I don't and that the actor is talented in the role, they'll keep grilling me about it and how pathetic the actor/character/movie is, I'll get upset trying to defend myself and justify my passion, they won't care as long as they get their point across...\n\nI sometimes question whether I should stop writing and editing for these actors, but if I did, I'd stop being me.\n\nMy friend is literally making me question myself and my personality, because I want to please them, because they're all I have now.\n\nBut after all this conflict over my passions, I can't talk to MY ONLY FRIEND about said passions anymore, because they'll totally disrespect the things I'm passionate about. They think they're just giving their opinion and stating facts, but it's REALLY making me upset the more they go on about it.\n\nI just want to know how I can stop this...and that it's ok to be passionate about actors and their character roles.\n\nPlease tell me I'm not alone, and that this friend I have is being nothing short of toxic, because that's what I believe, yet I don't want to look insane when I confront them...\n\nMy happiness is justified and I am allowed it, even if it's through writing fan fic or making videos of my fave people. It's not like it's entirely controversial. Writing fan fic is common. Making video edits of a movie character is common.\n\nAnd it just so happens that I have a friend who watches movie edits and writes fan fiction, yet THEY DON'T LIKE THE STUFF **I** MAKE VIDEOS/FAN FIC ABOUT. All they wanna do when I mention one of my faves, is kick my happiness to the curb. \n\nThey've not even SEEN my fan fic and videos! Why? Cause I know they don't like the actors/characters I do these things in honour of. My friend won't like my work, so what's the point in sharing that side of me with them? What's the point in sharing this side of me with ANYONE, if all they're going to do is judge it and say it's weird...\n\nBut what gets me is THEY DO THE SAME THING AS ME - They write fan fic, they watch movie edits on YouTube, just with different characters. Characters that I could EASILY criticize, but don't to keep them happy. Besides, I wouldn't call someone out for loving something no matter how much I hate it. I'd keep my opinion to myself or I'd share it with someone who feels a similar way.\n\nYou'd think my friend, knowing how I feel about these characters, would do the same. Nope. They run around freely, disrespecting my favourite characters.\n\nWhat's worse is I feel bad for liking anything now, especially actors. \n\nI feel bad for writing about their fictional characters, I feel bad for editing videos about the movies they're in... I even feel bad for TALKING about these actors because everything I talk about, everything that excites me, it all evolves around movies, some of their actors and video games...cause I'm a nerd...and I thought they were too.\n\nInstead, they're just really harsh about the things that make me happy. :(\n\nAlthough the things that make them happy could be considered far more controversial...but do I judge them for what they like? No. Yet they still judge me...\n\nEvery conversation I have with this friend nowadays just turns into an argument regarding my favourite actor.\n\nAnd if THAT wasn't enough, I can't even post on social media about my favourite movie character anymore without getting a snarky comment from my friend saying how the character sucks and will never be a good character no matter how many things I post related to said character.\n\nYo, I'M NOT TRYING TO GET YOU TO LIKE HIM! I'M JUST EXPRESSING MY LOVE FOR HIM! PLEASE TRY TO RESPECT THAT AND LEAVE MY POST ALONE! YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO LIKE THE POST, JUST SCROLL PAST IT WITHOUT COMMENTING SOMETHING RUDE!!\n\nIt baffles me how some days, my 'friend' can't be bothered to message me, they can't take a second out of their day to say hi and ask how I am, but they CAN take a second out of their day to post a salty comment on a picture of one of my faves.\n\nSomething along the lines of: \"This guy sucks and shouldn't be in the movie.\" Or just an angry react. It's like, they're seeing the risk of upsetting me with this UNNECESSARY angry react, but they're still gonna take it anyway.\n\nAnd keep in mind they've known me for YEARS, so they should KNOW that this is going to upset me, because I get upset really easily...thanks depression for making me so fragile - Diss my favourite actors and I'm in tears cause they're the closest thing I have to actual friends/family anymore.\n\nYeah, but they still do it anyway. 3 years of friendship don't matter so long as they get their nagging point across until it deflates my self esteem...\n\nSee, now I just associate all my favourite characters/actors with these arguments and invalid yet nagging reasons as to why they suck...and it's really upsetting to me how this friend can think that it's ok to do this to me, to blast my opinions into space as if they're irrelevant.\n\nI should wrap this up anyhow.\n\nHope to get some replies...if this situation makes any sense. Although it might not, so again I'm sorry for wasting your time.\n\nAlso sorry if it seems like I'm going in circles with this rant...I'm just really lost and conflicted. I don't want to give up the source of my happiness just to please a 'friend.'\n\nHopefully someone understands where I'm coming from and can maybe give me some advice. :)\n\nI got no other friends to turn to, so...here I am. Strangers will have to do! Thanks for coming to my TED talk.\n\nSorry for boring you. I'd recommend watching a cute duckling video just to help you forget the stress of my rant.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We were 4 people in total, one was driving (sober ofc) and the rest of us did drink. We had good time and everything went without problems.\n\nEventually the dude who was sober had to go out early in the morning so we decided to leave at like 3 a.m\n\nAll good though the friend I know from work suggested we go back to town and stick outside for a bit longer. For the record we were a good amount drunk. I wasn't feeling dizzy or anything but we had a good amount in the blood.\n\n\nNow the actual story:\n\nWe were sitting on a bench, talking a bit but it started to became silent since we both were starting to feel the alcohol. I was also quite tired from the day so I thought maybe a little break doesn't hurt.\n\nHe was starting to text with some people and they told him to come over. He asked me and I wouldn't have minded but I was starting to feel a bit sick from the alcohol and I was like \"No man let's just chill it out here a bit more\" maybe not the best answer but my point was to relax a bit on the bench so I wouldn't feel too sick to walk afterwards.\n\nHe didn't reply back and I closed my eyes a bit and laid down on the bench, trying to get that sickening feeling away. I opened my eyes after like 2 minutes and looked around and he was gone. I thought he went for a pee or something like that but he really went away.\n\nNow I tried to get to call him on the phone and texted him but he didn't respond to either. At that point I was starting to feel shitty because in my past I had quite some people who played with my trust and left me behind while I was doing favours for them. It for sure wasn't a case like that but because of the alcohol those memories came back to me in no time. I was starting to get angry and pissed and just sat on that bench for like half an hour without a clue what to do.\n\nThe Problem was I couldn't drive because I was drunk and I didn't know much people in town (it wasn't the town where I lived) so I couldn't just walk home.\n\nHalf a hour later they came back and I was so pissed at my friend that I just wanted my keys out of his car and leave. \n\nThat night I slept in my car.\n\nThe next day he asked me what's wrong via text and tried to call me but I didn't picked up because I felt hurt. I know for a fact that it wasn't on purpose because he told me that if he's drunk and goes outside the fresh air makes him sick and he goes blank. He doesn't know what happened. He also told me he was very worried that he fucked up. I do believe him. He wouldn't play behind my back normally.\n\nThat was a week ago and looking back at it now it wasn't that bad but at the time it happened I was really pissed and hurt.\n\nSo the question is, am I overreacting. Looking back at it I would say yes but maybe someone had a similar experience and would like to give context. I wouldn't want to lose this guy as friend as we had good deep conversations about every topic possible and that's something I wouldn't like to lose.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I have always been lucky to have lots of good friends and strong friendships in my life but when in school or uni I used that as the primary way of seeing them.\n\nSince being a kid, I remember not knowing what to do if a friend came over for dinner - apparently watching TV wasn't okay so instead one time we read in my garden aged 8. I was confused why this didn't go down well at the time. Another friend I'd been on holiday with and and yet she first came into my house about 6 years into our friendship (age 16). This and similar situations have meant since being a teenager I didn't invite people over as I genuinely didn't know what to do when they were round. Lack of practice in this has just made things worse/more nervous so I don't know when I last invited a friend over to my flat besides my boyfriend or jointly with my flatmate.\n\nI also struggle with hanging out with friends 1 to 1. The anticipation is worse than the event itself, especially as I'm chatty when I get going and so are many of my friends. Unfortunately this means that I don't seek to hang out with friends much, needing prompting to meet up with school friends when in my hometown, and feel I am losing touch with people I care about.\n\nPlease can you help me find ways to get more comfortable at inviting friends to hang out? I would also LOVE ideas for mate dates, especially stuff you can do at home as I honestly have none!", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

In public I sadly don't have many friends and most of my friends are on here from Reddit. They have been so awesome and nice and I can't thank them enough.  I was hoping I can make friends with more people like that. Don't worry about those I'm already talking with I will still talk with you. Just trying to expand my friends list. \n\nI graduated from college with a degree in film mostly focusing on editing. I suffer from both anxiety and depression. It effects me a lot on day to day basis mostly depression. Some days I'm fine Some I'm not. So if I complain about being depressed please understand I can't control it and at least be sympathetic towards it.\n\nI'm somewhere on the autism spectrum. Its not as severe as other people probably. Like you wouldn't think i have It because I'm on the high functioning side of the spectrum. However my social skills are really bad which makes it difficult to make friends in real life. \n\nI can be very shy, lonely and boring person. I have a hard time making conversation so I might be boring to talk to at times. I will try my best not to. I don't have much in my life. The good news Is that I'm getting better but, still have tough time making conversation.\n\nIn terms of Hobbies. My favorite stuff to do is watch movies or tv shows. Some of my favorite movies are The Dark Knight, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, and Apocalypse Now. Some of my favorite tv shows currently are Big Little Lies, The Handmaid's Tale, Black Mirror, Stranger Things, Westworld, Rick and Morty, American Horror Story, Barry and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. However I watch a lot of other movies and shows as well. I'm also big Fan of Star Wars, Game of Thrones, and Marvel. So feel free to give me suggestions on movies or shows to watch\n\nI love animals particularly Dogs and hamsters. Huskies are my favorite breed but I also love bulldogs. Sadly I don't have a dog or any pet but, would love one in the future. \n\nI'm a big WWE fan or at least try to watch what I can. Been watching since 2006. So if you like WWE that would be awesome. \n\nI love rock music from the 70s-90. My favorite bands are (AC/DC, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Guns N Roses, Kiss, Metallica, and Queen). \n\nOther things I like are to learn about history, conspiracy theories/mysteries even though I don't believe most of them, Memes, and Sports (particular baseball/American football) \n\nSo yeah feel free to message me if any of these things interest you \ud83d\ude03. If you going to message me I recommend you being around my age at least 19-27. Nobody younger or older to chat with cause I feel it would be awkward lol. I can make some exceptions. \n\nImportant, don't bother sending me a message if your just going to ghost. It really hurts and I don't like doing that either to others unless we don't connect or something. Also I  don't like when a conversation fizzles out and I don't ever hear from you again. It's fine if your forgot to respond but, I usually think if it fizzles out and you never get back to me. That you don't care to talk again. \n\nDon't care what gender just want friends who share interests to talk. I have Whatsapp, Snapchat and, Discord but I want to keep the conversation on Reddit for now. Until we get to know each other more. I prefer the pm message box and not the chat but whatever works for you. So yeah just msg me your age, gender, and a little bit about yourself so I know you read all this lol.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

To them you are someone nameless to talk to, to have fun with, to chat. But only for a brief period. People have real life problems that doesn\u2019t involve you. They will ghost you, reject you, hurt you. I thought I knew this, but in truth I didn\u2019t heed this warning.\n\nI fell for someone on the internet. Not love but platonic. They were kind, funny, nice, and loved the same things as me. We had fun. Lots of fun. I began neglecting real life to talk to them. It was wild, a whirlwind. They made me feel good about myself. They were patient and talked to me. Let me talk. I felt like I was heard, I felt like I was loved. \n\nI have problems haha. I feel like most of the people on here has problems. That\u2019s ok. Seek real life help. Make friends in real life. Have a backing. Don\u2019t go to the internet for relationships because that will never happen.\n\nThe truth is, they never cared about me. To them I was but a faceless person to have fun with. To destress. To talk to after real life was over.\n\nThey say internet relationships aren\u2019t real and please heed this warning. I didn\u2019t. They were good people, but I was never their priority. That\u2019s just the facts. No matter how much attention I gave, they wouldn\u2019t care for that. I knew the dangers, but I just connected so hard with them. I loved them like they were my sibling. I put my heart out there when they never cared to begin with. To them, it was another nameless person on the internet. Another meaningless person to rp with. To me... well. They were my support. That\u2019s where I failed.\n\nI\u2019m an emotional person.

Which is funny since when I chipped his windshield on his car by accident I had to cough up $1000 since he went to dealer to fix it. Lol \n\nHe\u2019s a good friend and I want to keep it that way how can I calmly explain that if you drive drunk and kill someone on accident you will still pay for it dearly. So accident or not you have to pay for it period. I\u2019m keeping his bike as collateral for now but I\u2019m worried he can just call the cops report it as stolen and that\u2019s it I\u2019m screwed. Any ideas?\n\nI gave him a week to get his shit together and if nothing happens than I will need his title and keys otherwise I will just part out his bike.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

We got close in an instant but I didn't trust her right away. I hang out with her just because I didn't want to be alone and because she was fun to be around. I started to semi-trust her during a school excursion when a friend of ours Marie fell into the sea because of the change in the strength of the tide and a wave \"ate\" her while she was taking selfies and I needed someone to help me look for our teachers, doctors and buy first-aid stuff from the supermarket Maira lend me some money. After that, I started to trust her more and more through the following 3 years things happened that Maria proved to be a very good friend who wasn't afraid to be rude or selfish when no one else wanted to be. Maria had gone through some things that I couldn't understand and I had gone through things she couldn't understand. And that was one of the things that kept me from fully trusting her.\n\nI met Zorzet through Maria while we were sitting the Pan-Hellenic Exams (something like the SATs, these exams would tell us which universities would accept us based on the scores we reached and the scores the universities have set as acceptable scores) Maria told me that Zorzet was Maria's best friend. Zorzet and I met twice for coffee with Maria after two very important exams and once we were done we met once with Zorzet without Maria and I figure out that we had similar hobbies and liked similar music.\n\nIn a span of summer and a couple of months later, the three of us were always in contact through Facebook and phone calls, we helped each other through adjusting to college life in three different cities. During the Christmas break, Zorzet called me her best friend for the first time. All that was two years ago. \n\nThen from the other side of things through the five years prior to meeting Zorzet and during my trial run friendship with maria and the rest of our group, I was hurt by an old best friend during all of this and I was trying to deal with it and heal from that hurt while trying to trust these new people and give them the benefit of the doubt. I didn't feel safe which led me to try to maintain first an Internet friendship and then a-real-life one, that's how I met my Internet best friend Tina and a very good friend Iro, I told them how things were in my home (I was abused at home) and I was trying to fix my family and get over the hurt, those two helped me and gave me strength to finally approach a new real-life friendship and even allow it to become best friend status. I also had a very good friendship with a girl named Olivia with whom we met through a Computer Science/AP English school project when I was in 2nd Grade of Junior High School and Olivia and I were paired up to be Internet pen-pals for three years but I moved away in the 2nd year-mark for this project and I gave up my spot to another student. A couple of months later, I joined Wattpad and my first follower was Olivia who got surprised and asked me why I had left the project. We got talking and for the following five years we would talk through Wattpad, Twitter, Facebook, Skype and even Viber (a calling service similar to What's Up). The Olivia moved from Taiwan to Texas and we lost touch for a few weeks but we re-connected and we had been friends for eight years by now. College and Olivia's immigration process kept us busy and now we haven't talked as often as we used to because we never had time and time zones were very weird. \n\nDuring, halfway my second year of college (aka last year) I met my best friend Karen who comes from a similar background as me. Both lost friends when we decided to speak of the abuse inside the house only to be asked we did something to cause the abuse, both of us tried to fix our families and ourselves in as a way to loosen the abuse. Both of us weren't in a head-space for college dealing with physical health issues and mental health issues. We met and instantly we started to talk about the dark stuff, stuff I don't speak with anyone because when i tried most of my friends couldn't relate or handle it and I understood that all of us had hard lives and when we would get together we wanted only to see the good stuff, laugh, smile and act like kids because we knew the moment we would leave the coffee shop we would be under the pressure to act like adults while still being 14/15/16/17 and 18. So, I kept this dark stuff inside me and when I met Karen I was pleasantly surprised that someone was even willing to talk about these and even relate to things. She soon became one of my five best friends.\n\nSo, I felt this need to do something to let my best friends know how much I appreciate them and how they haven't abandoned me when things got hard. (Oh! The irony there...)\n\nNow, about a week or so ago, I felt so happy having such great best friends and a very good circle of friends. Friends that we might not be in contact with all the time but when we can, we get together and we have fun. And through the seven years of friendship, we have gone through highs and lows even deaths of parents and loved ones that keep us together or at least tied with an invisible thread, as I see it.\n\nI wanted to do something to thank firstly my best friends and then my good friends. So, I thought what a better way to thank them with a thank you post on Facebook and tag them?\n\nOh! How wrong I was...\n\nI post it and sent it to Zorzet in a screenshot in our group chat (mine, Zorzet's and Maria's) since she deleted her Facebook account after her abusive ex used it as a form of spying on her, at first she was all fluttered and said how much she loved me and then she says and I quote/translate;\n\n\"Maria and I are your best friends, not Karen, Tina and Olivia. Those are your good friends, not your best friends.\"\n\nI told her that all of them were my best friends and she shouldn't feel insecure because each person I consider my best friend is because they have something special and unique that I admired.\n\nShe didn't like that. She texted me personally and said that she doesn't consider me her best friend anymore because in her mind (and I understand her way of thinking till a certain point) the title best friend shouldn't be handed out easily and she thought that was what I was doing.\n\nI felt heartbroken.\n\nI tried to explain to her that I was trying not to be possessive over people because in the past I became possessive over my ex-best friend and our friendship ended and it took me years to finally allow myself to trust people enough to come close to me and call them my best friends. That I knew Tina for seven years by that time, I knew Olivia for about 8 years and Karen for a year, I knew Maria for seven years and I knew her for two years.\n\nShe didn't want to understand. She didn't speak to me for two days and then she texted me saying how she wanted to go back to being good friends, just like how we were before becoming best friends because she liked me as a person.\n\nThrough it, all Maria didn't even read the messages or like the post I had tagged her and when she read the messages in the group chat she didn't say anything but by that time in my mind her and Zorzet had stopped being my best friends and apparently the same had happened to Zorzet because she changed the name of the group chat from Besties to Firey Trio.\n\nA day later, when the four days marked was completed, Zorzet texted into the group chat a plain ass hi and started to act normal again. Maria though just answered once through the 24 hours of that day with a Hi and how are you...\n\nBefore all of this, Maria would at least call me 3 times a day even more and Zorzet would call me 3 or four times a week and we would speak for hours.\n\nAfter all of this, none of them called me.\n\nI'm 1000% sure that Maria is in constant communication with Zorzet and supports her and she has taken to her \"side\" our common group of friends since none of them have contacted me in over a week.\n\nKaren knows all of this and finds it weird and childish and honestly so do I! I spoke to some other good friends of mine who don't know Maria or Zorzet and they are a lot older than all of us and they agree with me and Karen that it's a stupid reason a friendship to be ruined by a thank you post on Facebook!\n\nI even asked my 15 goi8ng 16 years old little sister and she agrees that it's a bullshit reason for a friendship to end like that. My mum and aunt even my dad think it's stupid.\n\nNow, all of us have ages ranging from 19 to 20, 21 and 22.\n\nDuring the first day of me not being best friends with them I wanted to delete them from Facebook and other social media, remove myself from the group chat and completely stop talking to them. I was angry and hurt especially towards Zorzet who tried to make me feel bad for having more best friends except for her and Maria. But since Zorzet texted in that group chat and acts as if everything is alright when it's not I had to rethink my whole idea....\n\nBut should I remove myself from the group chat? Should I finally takeup my mum's friend's offer and move away for my residency and not tell anyone from my high school friend group since they haven't contacted me through it all?\n\nI'm so tired of always trying to be a good and honest friend and only getting screwed over and used and when I do something remotely selfish (like following my parents to my maternal grandma's hometown to be there for emotional support while my parents dealt with lawyers and inheritance stuff.) they get angry and call me selfish and \"punish me\" by not talking to me.\n\nLast night, I realized that this whole thing reminds me of how mum used to emotionally abuse me when I was a child and a teen. I grew angry towards myself for falling into the same abusive environment while I spent seven years trying to get out of one only to fall into another. Now, I and mum have worked over our issues and still do that's why my relationship with her is a little bit better but the amount of energy I put into it and how hard it was and the trust issues I have permanently scar me and I foolishly I shared all this with Zorzet and Maria and they did something similar.\n\nWas I wrong for not apologizing for having more than two best friends? Was I wrong to classified this friendship as an emotionally abusive one? Will it be a bad move that would destroy any potential chance of this friendship to heal itself if it's not emotionally abusive if I remove myself from the group chat and the friendship?\n\nI am afraid that I'll be alone again because Karen would be far away so we can meet often and Tina even if we would be in the same city it's still hard to meet and we have never seen each other face to face. And after all of this, I don't know if I want to try to make new friends...\n\nOr should I use them just to chase my loneliness away but never truly trust them?\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nSorry for the long post.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I don't know. But what i do know is that either i am *too* social, or there is something wrong with my friend.\n\nLet's call this friend Lara.\n\nSo Lara and I have been friends since fourth grade (year 5) and currently we are in eighth grade (year 9). We used to be in the same class when we first met but we were not in the following years.\n\nSo 7th grade starts and BOOM! My whole gang has left the school, great!\n\nIt's break time, so I go to try and socialize, then this superly annoying girl from my class (call her Nat) decided to hang out with me.\n\nI was cool, since I was pretty lonely, It's nice to get a change, then Lara (from another class) found out.\n\nShe wasn't really angry at me, she just hated Nat so much.\n\nThis went on for about half a year, then suddenly they accept each other and are best friends.\n\nI have no idea how it happened, don't ask me.\n\nAt this point i was freaking out mentally because i was not socializing at all. And sure, Lara and Nat were nice, but we weren't good friends in fourth grade and i just didnt feel that spark i felt with anyone else.\n\nSo i went to higher classes and lower classes, i tried to be friendly and reconcile with old friends, and i worked. I was really happy and kinda disappointing at myself for not realizing this was the solution.\n\nBut *ofcourse* something had to go wrong. One day i was just walking around, and Nat just came up beside me and told me that Lara was mad at me.\n\nLike what did i do wrong? Am i wrong with reconciling with my friends? I talked to her about it but she denied it, it was obvious that she was still angry though.\n\nThis continued to happen many times, so i tried hanging out with her more, it might make her happier? But it just continued going on and on and on and **on.**\n\nEverytime i asked her about it she said nothing, and not only that, but as I discovered recently, early on in the year she told me about this other group of friends i had, and how they always bullied her, so i trusted her and stayed away from them.\n\nShe was lying.\n\nIn eighth grade i started making a difference, I am not going to have my social life ruined because of some kind of grudge you hold over people i like when they did nothing wrong.\n\nThe other day we were playing cards in school and we got busted (we were playing with another 2 friends of mine), so i waved it off and took the blame and the two unnamed friends left.\n\nAs we were going back to class, Lara just whispered in my ear: fake friends.\n\nI have been friends longer with them that i have her. I got really angry because they were the only people i could *trust* in the whole school. but i just concealed it.\n\nMore and more things like this have been going on and now im just outright ignoring when another person tells me shes mad at me. One time, an older student spread a rumour about me whispering behind peoples' backs. I usually am not affected by this, i would just go and confront whoever said it, but Lara just outright believed it and would always shoot me nasty looks.\n\nI am sick of this. I don't want to be her friend anymore, as childish as it may seem. I had enough.\n\nI  want to tell her this, but she is just so sensitive, and we are in the same class now. I just can't bring myself to do that.\n\nCan you please help me do what you think is right? Because i am utterly clueless here! Ive never been in a situation like this before.\n\nPS. Only when writing this did i realize i felt like a third wheel. That would have helped if i knew it sooner.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Everything was going good and we were making plans about marriage and life after that. It was like a dream come true for me (as none of my relationships lasted more than a month). I was over the moon and then suddenly she started partying a lot with her new friends from her new workplace. She started giving me less time and spending more time with them. We were in a long distance for about 6months now. I was cool at first but then I started getting insecure about her partying so much. So, I told her the truth about my insecurities honestly and instead of going through with it together, she directly told me that I should trust her and let her be. I know she was right that I should trust her but I feel she had assumed that I am gonna doubt her no matter what. Things got a little worse and finally after next 6 months we broke up. \n\nShe got a new boyfriend in like next 15days but after like couple of months she texted me back that she was missing me a lot and all she could think about was me. I was at a similar place as she meant everything to me. We got back on New year's this year and things started getting better. But I could still sense some distance in her heart. I never said anything but thought that it would be fine after a while. We met in April after like a year and it was best week we spent together but the day I had my flight, she told me that we are not together and she still don't think me as her boyfriend. And after I left, she went on a date the same evening. She told me about the date and I pretended to be cool with it but I was not. The next three months it was like hell as she didn't want to be committed to me again and I wasn't able to live without her. So, our story dragged itself. In July, she decided not to talk to me and then blocked me. After a couple days later she again called me back to see how I was doing. Then she told me that she wants to explore other people and start dating. I was okay with it. But then I started missing her like hell so I tried talking to her. Everytime I tried, it ended with us fighting. So she cut me off completely a month back on my birthday. We didn't talk for like one and a half month. Now, today I tried texting her from a different number, she knew it was me. It's been the first time that she had kept me blocked for more than a month. So, I asked if she was planning to talk to me ever again. She told me that she was dating this new guy and looking forward to a new relationship with him. This killed me and I broke. I told her that I have missing her a lot and cannot live without her. She told me that she is never coming back as she cannot ever live with me. She told me that I can never be happy and I can never let her be happy. She also said that she does not want me to contact her ever again. \n\nThis has killed me a lot and I am never able to get her out of my head. Why do I still have feelings for her when she clearly has nothing left for me? At the back of my mind, I still think that she is the one and she will come back and every night I sleep, I think about her. I wake up and think about her. I try keeping myself busy but she is there always in my mind. This has decreased my efficiency at work and in life. I cannot feel happy and always feel like the biggest loser in life. What should I do? I only have a couple of friends and they are also busy in work and life. I cannot communicate this with anyone and this loneliness is killing me. I am having suicidal thoughts like then maybe she'll realize how much I have been loving her. I have panic attacks and sometimes they get worse where I can't even breathe. I tried taking professional help but it wasn't of much help. If anyone has survived reading till here... Please give me some advice and help. How can I find someone who doesn't change her mind after a year that no she doesn't love me anymore. It feels like no one loves me and I do not have any purpose of living anymore. I don't wanna end my life but it seems like the only option for me. \n\nThank you for your time and advice. And sorry if I bored you with my troubles.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

In hindsight, I think this post should've went in something like r/offmychest or r/rant because after people started reaching out to me about it, I realized that I just needed to get it all off my chest but I didn't really wanna talk more about it I guess. Thank you so much to everyone who reached out though, I'm so thankful and grateful for all of you :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey, I guess the title is pretty self-explanatory.\n\nI really want to at least attempt to make this not an incredibly depressing post because that's just not fun for anyone, but bare with me if that doesn't actually end up happening. Where do I start? To somehow sum it all up, in the past year, everything that I've worked for over the course of my entire life has simultaneously gone to absolute shit, and I'm gonna tell you all about it.\n\nLast April, I started getting these incredibly painful headaches that I had gotten once before during my senior year of high school. Thankfully, I was back home for the holidays (I go to university abroad) and I could see my old doctor, or at least a doctor that he recommended. He was unavailable at the time so I ended up seeing this other guy that he said was just as good as he was and assured me that I was in capable hands. I saw him, and after a couple of meetups with him, he ended up putting me on medication that was meant to help with, what he referred to as migraines. Now, something you have to understand is that where I come from, pretty much all medicine is over the counter and doctors usually enjoy taking the easy way out when they thing it's not something too serious. So, he prescribed to me was a pill to take in the morning, a pill to take at night, and two different kinds of pain killers that I was to take in the event of a migraine. Now, the boxes of the medicine said that the one I take in the morning was to help with Anxiety and that it would essentially lower my heart rate, and the one I take at night was a very weak anti-depressant. I was a bit skeptical when I read the leaflets but I assumed that the doctor knew better than I did and began taking the medication, and it worked. No more headaches.\n\nI went back to London (where I study) and continued the medication as I was told to do, and as the days went by, I got weaker and weaker. I felt as if i couldn't function, as if I was just always mentally and physically exhausted. I couldn't get any work done and my project wasn't progressing at all because I could not think. I thought about stopping, but the state I was in was preferable to the headaches and I wasn't willing to go back to those. So I kept going. A month into this, my grandmother passed away. Now, a family member passing away is a big deal to anyone, but this was something else for me. This woman had raised me, she had been one of the very few constant female figures in my life and she was gone. I was a wreck, but I wasn't. My family was never one to be down and so we dealt with this like we deal with everything, by reminiscing and smiling in the face of adversity. I kept up the facade quite well, up until the funeral. It started off okay, I was surrounded by loved ones and everyone was doing their best to make sure that every member of my family was smiling, except for my other grandmother.\n\nIn order to understand why this woman is such a bitch, you need to know that her daughter, my mother, walked out on everyone when I was 10. She walked out on me, my dad, her mother, and her sister along with her children. We didn't hear from her for years. Now, my mother and her mother are the two most depressing human beings on the face of the planet- they just love the sad. My grandmother used to call me in to her office when I was younger to tell me about what would happen the day she died, as if that was  a normal thing to discuss with a 7 year old, but I digress. Anyway, so my mother came back a few years ago into her mother's life and decided that she did nothing wrong and that my father's family was the one to blame for all her mistakes. My grandmother took her in with open arms and they both started harassing the entire family. My mother and her would cause all kinds of problems, legally and otherwise, for everyone on both sides of the family and my grandmother would always play the role of the innocent old woman. Until the day of the funeral.\n\nI have 0 contact with my mother and almost 0 contact with my grandmother, but the latter decided to show up and pay her condolences when the woman who took both of their roles passed away. She came in, said hi to my father from afar, and grabbed me by my hand and started pulling me towards a corner. She looked me in the eye, smiled, and said, \"Now you know what death looks like.\" Now, I had cried before this moment but at that point, that's when I completely broke down. It just felt like I had felt everything I was avoiding all of a sudden, and once I was done crying in the bathroom, it's safe to say I had nothing else to give or feel anymore.\n\nFastforward a few days later, and I flew back to London to continue my studies. I'm not going to say the next part to brag, but purely to illustrate how much I feel like I have fallen. I studied my ass off growing up to get into a good university and get the hell out of my country. I knew that I didn't fit in and I wanted out. Not only that, but I had to prove to my father and a multitude of other people that my being a girl was no reason to stop me from going abroad and that I could get into somewhere better than any of my male counterparts could. I graduated as one of the only 5 high honor students in my class and got into what is considered the best institution for architecture in the world. I did that. But after my grandmother died, that momentum, that drive that got me through high school, a foundation year, and a year and a half into my degree was gone. I wallowed in my room as my flatmate and the rest of our friends would wait for me in the living area, hoping that today I would do more than meet the delivery man outside the front door to pick up my food and take it back to my room. I felt completely and utterly dead, I honestly may as well have been.\n\nI tried, I really did to get my shit together and push through the last couple of months but I couldn't. Not to mention there was this psycho bitch who was trying to ruin my life and alienate me from all my friends. But anyway, as much as I tried, I couldn't do it. And when it came time for my final assessment, I wasn't there yet. So, they allowed to me to re-present a couple of weeks later (not as a favor, but it is an official option where when they think students just need a little more of a push, they do this. I was one out of dozens who got this). And I fucking tried, I tried so fucking hard to make my work better and to get it to the point where they would just pass me, but, I didn't. They asked me to repeat the year. Now, I am not someone who thinks I am the top at mu university or that my work is even one of the better ones, but I know that I did not deserve to fail because their reasons were bullshit. And to further argue my point, I had several peers send emails on my behalf to the school board telling them that this was unfair and that they were making a mistake.\n\nAfter the emails were sent out, the registrar asked to see me and we had the most irrelevant and pointless conversation I have ever had in my life. She didn't listen to me. I know this because her responses were unrelated to what I was saying, and I know this because I can pull up a dozen emails that I sent her between April and that point where I voiced concern over myself, my mental health, and how I did not think I would be able to pass this year. Emails that have gone unanswered for the most part. Not only those, but after our meeting, I decided to take a year out to focus on my mental health and when I tried to inform her of this, my emails and calls went unanswered as well. I've sent dozens and dozens of emails from July up until now and I have still not heard back from her once. But, I digress.\n\nA month or so after this, mid summer, my cousin passed away. We weren't very close, but he was still family. But the part that got to me the most wasn't that- it was that his death led to the first contact between me and my mother in over a decade. She had been sending me messages on Instagram and apparently watching me in high school as she moved into a building next door, but all of it had gone unanswered from me, until this. First, the day she found out he died (which was after I did considering her contact with her sister is a bit touch and go considering how she walked out), she sent me a message with the following: \"Your cousin xxxx has passed away, my condolences. I wonder if you're gonna make it or if you're gonna wait until your mother's entire family is dead to realize what you're doing is enough.\" Because I just needed another kick. And then I saw her at my aunt's house, for the first time in over a decade but I didn't say anything. And then came the day of the funeral.\n\nThe day of the funeral, my aunt asked me to stand with them because she wanted me there so I did. As soon as I got in the lineup, my grandmother looks at me and says in the most disgusted tone of voice, \"Why are you standing here? You have no place here, this is for family\". I told her that my aunt wanted me there and that it was her day so I will do as she says. She seemed angry but brushed it off and stood a couple of people down from me. And then my mother came and decided to stand directly fucking next to me as if she hadn't fucking attacked me a couple of nights prior by sliding into my goddamn DMs. She starts rubbing my back and I look at her and ask her what she thinks she's doing and if she really thinks this is the time for this. She continues rubbing my back and begins to say that she knows this isn't the right time but.. and then I cut her off and told her to get her hands off me. I was not about to me touched or treated like her daughter when all she has done for years is ignore me and harass my family causing everyone problems that were easily avoidable. But anyway, since then, well, I just feel like nothing.\n\nNow, I'm living back home. I'm grasping at straws, trying to give meaning to my life but I can't. I'm feeling more and more hopeless everyday but everyone who knows me just knows the happy version of me and all seem to think that the response to my current self is laughter and telling me that it'll pass and making jokes and comments that I can no longer respond to. I feel empty, alone, and worthless at best. And I just need to have a conversation without feeling like I'm being pitied and without hearing \"it's gonna be okay\" because I need more than that, that sentence isn't enough anymore.\n\nThis is long and I don't know if anyone is even gonna get this far but if you did, thank you, and I hope it wasn't too depressing. The only thing I can say is that I have a pretty good sense of humor about things when I'm not trying to just let it all out. I'm actually a pretty joyous person, but, that get's really exhausting really quickly.\n\nThank you again for reading,\n\nJ.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

And so his rudeness caused us to argue two days after I said do whatever with Chelsie even tho it would ruin are friendship he decided to be an ass hole to me so I ended up cutting him off and blocking him on everything and to make  things worse people at school started showing me pictures of them kissing and ever and it actually  scarred me but yeah anyways lmk how you feel about this \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "subreddit": "friendship"}

We \u201cdated\u201d for two days and she broke my heart and said it wouldn\u2019t work. It hurt like hell as I just accepted my feelings for her. Nonetheless I moved on and we became friends again. Then one month later we sort of started \u201cdating\u201d again then a week later she did the same thing and hurt me again. At this point I was done and moved my devastated ass along. We mended our friendship again and things were fine. But then she called me and said she wanted to try for real. I guess I\u2019m an idiot as I said yes to this. About three weeks later and a few days after I finally trusted her intentions she did it again and this was it for me. It\u2019s been about two weeks now and it still hurts and every time I think I\u2019m over it it comes back because this time was it for her and I\u2019ll never get another chance with her and there\u2019s my next problem.

However, over the course of the last several months she\u2019s started to make comments to me that are really slut shame-y. I think it comes from a place of having very different views on sex and relationships. She\u2019s very religious and I\u2019m not, and she feels that sex should only happen between people that are in love. She insists that she supports me in whatever I do, and she can be very supportive, but she makes these offhand comments often. I want to take them as jokes and not harbor bad feelings towards her when she\u2019s just kidding, but the more it happens the less it feels like she\u2019s just kidding. So where the grudge comes in, I made a mistake a few months ago and she made a remark to me that cut really deep and we ended up not speaking for a few weeks but did eventually talk about it and she apologized and we moved on. The trouble is, is that I\u2019m still incredibly hurt by what she said to me. I haven\u2019t brought it back up since because I don\u2019t like doing that sort of thing, but it still crosses my mind often. She is very quick to bring up moments when I have not been my best self, or remind me of remarks I\u2019ve made that were unkind. And I won\u2019t lie, I\u2019m not perfect. But it just seems like I do my best to not say and do things that are hurtful, and she constantly makes jokes that I\u2019m a dumb bitch, or a whore, and other jokingly insulting things. How do I tell her that this bothers me without starting a fight? I don\u2019t want to not be her friend, but I don\u2019t want to be as close as we are anymore.

We didn\u2019t know each other well then. We started talking at work a few months after we were being scheduled to work together. It took a bit but we eventually started hitting it off. We both had similar tastes in music and other things. We would have lunch break together and everything. We didn\u2019t start talking outside of work until she found out that I write music. She wanted me to teach her how to write music. That\u2019s actually how I got her number lol. From that point on we would rarely text but we would always talk at work. After some time, we started becoming close. I started developing feelings for her but would keep it to myself in order to not ruin anything. Everything was fine before then. Told her I liked her earlier this year. She never said she didn\u2019t like me back but her saying she was flattered meant she wasn\u2019t interested. From that point on, things changed even though she promised me it wouldn\u2019t. All of a sudden, she started talking to other coworkers more than me. It felt distant, I had never asked her to hang out beforehand but the two times I did, she said no or she was going with someone else. I remember her saying she was seeing someone when we first started talking but they ended up splitting. Anyway, from that day things have been different. I\u2019ve asked her on multiple occasions was she ok and she would often say yes. She called me her friend and everything. She recently well a few months ago was mad at me for telling someone that she likes a certain type of music even though the person also likes the same type of music. It was petty but I just assumed she was going through something and just took it out on me. Whenever I text her, sometimes she responds quickly or she won\u2019t respond for days or not at all. She went out with another of coworkers to some event. She asked another of my workers to hang with her. She also asked a worker who we both talk to to go with her somewhere. She would never ask me to go anywhere. The one time she did was about a year ago to some event out of state but I declined because I didn\u2019t know her that well. So basically it seems like she\u2019s been distant. She made a comment not too long ago saying and I\u2019m paraphrasing \u201csometimes you\u2019re alright and others you\u2019re just ugh!\u201d. I was caught off guard by that and backed away for a bit. She made another comment saying \u201cwe\u2019re not enemies, we\u2019re coworkers we\u2019re cool\u201d. I don\u2019t know where this is coming from all of a sudden. She told another mutual friend that when I asked her to the movies, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable going and wanted to remain friends without leading me on. She didn\u2019t tell me this she just said she wasn\u2019t interested in the movie. Maybe I\u2019m thinking too much about this. I recently found out that I suffer from anxiety and depression sometimes and she was the one who was trying to comfort me when I was going through it. Idk. She doesn\u2019t want to follow me on any social media platform but would follow someone else we work with. She recently got closer to another coworker and I mean really close. I gave her my camera a few months ago because always wanted one. Am I over thinking this? Should I talk to her about this? Should I keep my distance?

Post is a bit long but you'll see why.\n\nSo I have this cousin whom I've known for over 20 years. We've met when we were lads and we instantly hit it off. You can say we had a closer relationship than most. We used to talk on the phone for hours and hours of the time back then. As we got older, we didn't do that as much but moved on to online video games. So then it was hours and hours of that. Suddenly, we no longer play video games. We considered each other best friends. He struggles with texting but for some reason whenever I'm with him he's always texting people back or playing that beer pong game iPhone people have. He's never been the best at communicating. I can't really call him and speak for hours like we used to because we're grown adults and we have other things going on in our lives. I've tried getting him to speak up more or to follow through with friendships but he's not that type of person and he never will be. He always shrugged it off and told those who cared \"whatever you wanna do.\" When introduced my significant other to him, she told me that I'm the only one who puts thought into this friendship. I'm the only one who cares. But I refused to believe it and was so blinded by it. This was 10 years ago.\n\nTo give you an example, during his birthday, he came into town for the weekend with his friends. He told me that he would tell me where they're at so I could tag along for his birthday. So Friday morning I text him and ask what time he's arriving and he simply told sometime in the afternoon. Friday afternoon he told me that the weather was hotter than he expected and I replied with a sunblock joke. Saturday morning came along and I sent him a meme and he laughed it off. Saturday evening I asked him a question regarding his job and no response. Sunday morning, his actual birthday, on midnight, I texted him happy birthday. Sunday afternoon, no response. Sunday evening, no response, so I texted him I hope he had a good time in town for his birthday. A month later came my birthday. I don't expect anyone to text me or anything because I don't really expect much. As the day went by, my significant other was wondering why no one was greeting me happy birthdays and she felt bad. So she posted something on her Instagram. Her heart was in the right place but I wished she didn't do this. Suddenly all the texts came flowing. Couple hours of that post, he finally texted me. \"Sorry this is so late, but happy birthday!\" My question is, did he actually remember? Or was it the post that reminded him?\n\nAbout a week ago, we were supposed to go to a concert. He was going to tell me whether or not he was off so we would buy our tickets then, but he never told me whether or not he was off. I just figured he forgot to tell me because that's simply the type of person he is. I find out, he went to the concert with one of his friends.  \n\nSo my question is, does he value my friendship? His actions have been hurting me since we were teenagers because it feels like he truly doesn't care about me. Yes, he'll text me and entertain me sometimes, but has never reached out to me to do something. I always shrugged it off and just said that's the person he is. I always felt like I should completely cut him off from my life but it's so difficult to cut someone like him off. He's a part of me and he knows my entire life. But, mentally, I know that without him, I'd be better. I wouldn't have to wonder whether or not he'll text me or whether or not we'll hang out.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Plans fell through with the hotel Mary wanted to book and so I offered  to look for other options.

I also just prefer having close female friends and hanging out with friends like once a week max unless we work or have class tgt.\n\nAnyways we caught up by going to watch a movie cuz we didnt talk for awhile ( I had kinda forgot about him and was not so interested in maintaining the friendship). It was alright but I dont feel much affinity and wanted to be there to listen since he jusy got divorced.\n\nNow he messaged me to hang out 2 days in a row. Im just not interested, super tired, would rather stay home and stay with my bf who works a lot.\n\nHow am I supposed to tell him that Im kinda not the kind who wants to hang out a lot? Also I just dont want to get in a close friendship with men, I am more comfortable with women and usually have more hobbies in common. I think I will sound rude, I also have a hard time saying no and I know he is probably feeling lonely since the divorce.\n\nFor him it also seems very normal to invite me over or go clubbing which he suggested but thats a no for me, that would make me uncomfortable as I have a Bf.\n\nMy budget doesnt even allow that much going out even if I wanted to.\n\nAny suggestions?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

So, a couple of close friends of mine, let\u2019s call them D and V, have been through some stuff in the last month (relationship related, they broke up with their respective SO, and some other pretty heavy stuff). We were at a party, and D was basically having a breakdown thinking about his ex girlfriend, so I was comforting him and giving him some \u2018tough love\u2019 to try to pull him back together. Didn\u2019t really work, so I left him with with V, as they\u2019ve known each other for quite a lot and V is really good at comforting people. I get back to them and we basically hugged it out for a bit. I was pretty drunk, and started thinking about how sorry I was for them and how much I loved them, so I hugged them in a bit more heartfelt manner than I would have normally, and got a bit teary-eyed. V must have noticed, because the next day she sent me a text that made my fucking week, and that still gets me smiling like an idiot if I think about it. It read \u2018thanks for all you do for all of us, but remember that we are here for you as well, so next time you\u2019ll need a hug like last night come find me, there\u2019s not much of me to hold but I do love hugs\u2019.

Love soundtracks of any kind, musicals, and also listen to a lot of Japanese music such as Eve, Sou, The Oral Cigarettes, TK and so on.

I really need advice right now since I don't know what to feel anymore.\n\nI am a F, 22 years old and currently in college. I met my friend, \"J\", last year and basically we became great friends. He started off as a genuine, nice guy but as our friendship progresses and I got to know him well, it made me realize that despite his act of kindness towards us (his friends), he tends to shows off (in his defense, he said that he doesn't realize it), gets moody and angry easily when things doesn't go his way or something irritates him or someone doesn't agree with him. He also gets moody when people don't listen to him and most of all, degrades and makes us look like he is above us all. These are all observations that I got these past few months and I know that I shouldn't talk smack about him but i just want him to see that his attitude won't last long in the real world especially his friendships (his bestfriend and greatest friend already cut ties with him because of that) which led me to feel pity for him. From my perspective, it didn't mind me at first because we're all different and as long as it doesn't hurt anyone, it's fine by me but when he started to call me out and say that I'm the one who has a bad personality and kept telling me false accusations about myself then saying sorry afterwards cause his reason for that is because his \"hot headed\"? That's when I started to get irritated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told our friends about what happened and what he did to me and apparently, HE DOES THIS TO EVERY ONE OF US. I was so dumbfounded that I ended up laughing. No wonder that guy, despite having lots of friends in the campus, no one wants to stay and hang out with him willingly. I really want to help him but \"J\" is stuck in his own world and kept asking me these questions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Despite him being super nice to us, why don't we give the same amount of respect or nice-ness to him in return?\n* Why is the world so unfair to him?\n* Why does he have so many fake friends and why do some just keep ignoring him all together?\n\nI feel really bad for him and despite me being irritated with what he has done to me, I really want to help him.

Long story short it meant absolutely so much to be 20. Now usually I get money from my grandparents which I appreciate. I was let down in many ways and felt very alone on my birthday.\n\nI was applying for an apartment to get away from it all, yes on my birthday.. I had to call my work to figure out where to send employee verification to. After that, my store manager (the one I almost never see) told me \"Happy 20th birthday, for your birthday we gave you a raise, keep treating us well and we will treat you well.\"\n\nI got into some legal trouble a couple months ago, lost my car in the process and couldn't get it back, also for a awhile didnt know if I was going to have a roof over my head and was kicked out twice for 4 weeks in total. Got out of that place and to another which is it's own hell. But, and because of the legal trouble, they were the only ones who would hire me after my work shut down.\n\nBecause of all that I've just been keeping my head down, and working really hard even if I dont have a hard job, ive been going above and beyond on my own terms just on the basis of keeping this job so I can begin to rebuild and get myself a better life. The thought of being payed more didnt even begin to cross my mind.\n\nIt felt so incredibly uplifting and rewarding that simply because of my work ethic and the goal I have set had this type of payoff. Even more so on my birthday. It was even on the 91st day of my employment, where many jobs kinda know you are staying and you qualify for benefits and all those things. They wasted no time in doing this for me and I am so incredibly grateful. No one at work knows the situation I've been in, no one knows about any of it, the most anyone knows is that I take public transportation to work and that the only time I have been late was because I got on the wrong train, missing the bus too.\n\nIt's the day before I get my paycheck where the raise took affect, it's not a big raise, but it's really not about the money, it really isnt. It's about the thought... as stupid as it may sound. Yeah the money helps, but even without the raise I was slowly getting to where I need to be. I move into my very own apartment in a month, I have very little things, very little resources, a rough background, and very little people to even talk to let alone get help from. I've had to think outside the box to get some things done recently and I'm beginning to get myself back. I'm ready to actually achieve my goals instead of talking about wanting to do so.\n\nYou guys should check on your quieter friends who have goals and work hard, because chances are they are getting something done and have something they really want to share.\n\nSorry this was so long, Reddits the only place this wont just be simply slipped into a casual conversation so thank you for reading whoever got this far, I love you! And know that you too can achieve any goal you have! I believe in you, you can do anything you put your mind to. If I can do it so can you... all those positive affimations!\n\nTldr; got into trouble, lost a lot. Working on keeping my head down and working hard to create a better life for myself.

We met in college through a group where we had several mutual friends, and a friend that we saw as a mentor (I think she\u2019s 8 years older and worked at the college) who kept us in line and called us on our shit when I made stupid mistakes, etc. Lots of late night talks about anything and everything under the sun. We kept in touch mostly with this mentor and two other friends after leaving the college, but eventually, we all had a falling out. The falling out hasn\u2019t really been discussed\u2014there wasn\u2019t a big fight or anything. I have my own reasons for breaking off contact, as does he, and I\u2019m sure our former friends have their own reasons as well. We all kinda ghosted each other. \n\nRight around the time we were separating, our mentor friend started following me on social media and initiated contact after 3-4 years. I was really torn about this at first, especially without having cleared the air about why we hadn\u2019t spoken in 3 years, but the fond memories came flooding back and I really needed a friend. I\u2019m a new mom on top of everything else and she has two small children, so we mostly talk about them. I hesitated to even tell my ex about this because he\u2019d openly called her names and ranted about her in the first few days after I started talking to her again and it was clear that he was still bitter. \n\nWe made loose plans to meet up, as I\u2019d found some old art supplies that I thought she could use for her older kiddos. Then my ex and I broke up for good. I went to her and said something like \u201cI wanted our convos to stay lighthearted and fun, but here\u2019s what\u2019s up, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been pushing back plans. I know you want to see [my ex] when we hang out and I encourage you to reach out to him separately because he probably needs a friend, too.\u201d\n\nFast forward about a month. My ex is now living separately and I learn that they\u2019ve been talking, but at my ex\u2019s request... right after he learned that we were friends again (weeks after she initiated contact). In the back of my mind I feared that he\u2019d unloaded completely and let her know about all of his resentments and issues we\u2019ve ever had, because he\u2019s an open book like that and still very bitter about the end of our relationship. I tried to ignore those feelings and just nicely asked him to please not jeopardize my chance to rekindle our friendship, and there\u2019s a lot I could be telling her that I\u2019m not (he\u2019s been emotionally abusive and cruel for years) in order for them to reconnect. I genuinely have not shed him in anything but a positive light. He agreed.  \n\nLast night, the friend and I were talking and laughing (as one does on the internet I suppose) and I asked if she had any plans in the next couple of days to finally get together. The first question was ignored while she responded to something else I said. I asked again but more directly, and she left it on read and hasn\u2019t responded in almost a day. \n\nMy heart has been sinking all day and I\u2019m pretty confident I know what\u2019s going on. My ex is very manipulative. But I\u2019ve also been accused (all of those years ago) about being a little bit jealous in friendships (fair) and jumping to conclusions, so I\u2019m really trying not to. She\u2019s just not really one to isolate if it\u2019s a bad mental health day and has otherwise been active. \n\nI want to send her a message along the lines of \u201chey, so I know that you and [ex] have been talking, and I genuinely think that\u2019s great. You and him were close and for longer than we\u2019ve even known each other, and I can imagine he\u2019s relieved to have a friend who knows both of us and that he can vent to. He doesn\u2019t have a huge support system right now. But I fear that his anger and resentment towards me will jeopardize any chance we have at rekindling our friendship and I\u2019m scared that\u2019s why you haven\u2019t responded. There\u2019s two sides to every story and I\u2019ve been through it all with him, but I\u2019m more than my failed relationship. I\u2019m trying my best to be better and stronger every day and having you as a friend and mom-friend has been a huge blessing. I just kind of want to know where we stand and if we can clear the air over coffee or something.\u201d\n\nShould I send something like this? Should I wait or not send it at all?

It was an image of a female classmate in a tight swimsuit and you could see the folds of the bottom part of her body (i think you get my drift) and they shared it with my rich friends for the iPod. Never have I been so disgusted in my life and i believe that they would be bad influence over me so i want to end the friendship. Problem is i am socially awkward (never has much friends) and i dont know how to approach this.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I\u2019ve known m15, M, since we were little but got close about three years ago. I got close to L about a year later as M and L were already friends. \n\nThe first incident happened a couple weeks ago. I was in our group chat complaining about my brother and his girlfriend (m18, f17) She said something about them being in love and how i wouldn\u2019t understand, she\u2019s also never been in a relationship. I said something and then talked about something else but she never responded to me. i texted her explaining why i was upset and that i was sorry if i offended her and she left me on read. I got annoyed and ranted to my other friend and got a little hostile with him but apologized because it wasn\u2019t his fault. I kept apologizing but she kept ignoring me and i couldn\u2019t figure out what i did wrong. She didn\u2019t talk to me for like five days. It upset me a lot. \n\nThe second thing happened a couple days ago. M and L went to Ls homecoming as friends but i wasn\u2019t upset about that. I posted on my spam that both M and L follow, saying \u2018i\u2019m bored someone please talk to me\u2019 L commented a clown emoji so i asked her what was up, and i can admit i did sound a little defensive. She asked me what the fuck my problem was and i explained. She said \u2018i was acknowledging your post because i couldn\u2019t talk. If i meant it like that i would\u2019ve said clown:\ud83e\udd21\u2019 i said \u2018oh i\u2019m sorry i didn\u2019t know.\u2019 she responded with \u2018you fucking better be.\u2019 Then she posted twice on her spam about me the first post being captioned with 6 clown emojis and the second saying \u2018Did you just all of the sudden forget who i am \u00bf\u00bf\u2019 \nI apologized again saying i didn\u2019t want to ruin her night and that i hadn\u2019t meant to offend her and she ignored me and posted twice more something something along the lines of \u2018I don\u2019t take attitude don\u2019t come at me with it i\u2019ll dish it back.\u2019 I kept quiet the whole time. On my spam i posted tik tok lyrics saying \u2018it\u2019s a little bit funny.\u2019 not trying to shade her in any way. She posted \u2018don\u2019t even try to cover yourself up \ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd2a\u2019 \nI didn\u2019t talk to her for two days and didn\u2019t respond to her in the group chat because i was pissed off and didn\u2019t feel like dealing with her. \nShe later snapped me two days later and didn\u2019t mention it or apologize once and we went on. \n\nSo often i say uwu or owo as a joke. I had sent that to her after she sent me a post of something. She posted on her spam \u2018Just a reminder saying uwu of XD doesn\u2019t make you cute or quirky it makes you look stupid and illiterate and stuck in a 2007 tumblr phase.\u2019 \nI texted her asking if it was about me, which i knew it was. She said no i\u2019m just saying in general\u2019 i said okay and she said \u2018why would i just now be telling you to stop you\u2019ve literally done it the entire time i\u2019ve known you.\u2019 i told her it was bc of her spam post and she said her and M were talking. I said okay i was just confused. \nThen she sends \u2018I don\u2019t think you want this smoke/catch these hands\u2019 i said no why would it and she says \u2018K didn\u2019t think so. Would be a fun activity for a rainy day.\u2019 i didn\u2019t respond except for okay and didn\u2019t talk to her for the rest of the day because i was pissed off and didn\u2019t know i\u2019d she was mad at me and didn\u2019t want to start anything as it\u2019s Ms birthday this weekend and i don\u2019t want to make it bad for him with L and i fighting. \nFast forward to today. She snapped me and i responded and she sent me a middle finger. I was like okay and didn\u2019t respond. I dmed her and asked if she was really mad at me. She said \u2018why are you asking what are your circumstances on that.\u2019 \ni said \u2018because i didn\u2019t know if you were joking last night and the middle finger snap and she responds with \n\u2018Um i was obviously joking or i would pull up and i\u2019ve sent you????? so many middle finger snaps ?????\u2019 i said \n\u2018okay i just didn\u2019t know. And i wouldn\u2019t have thought much about the snap if i wasn\u2019t confused about last night i just wanted to know.\u2019 \n\nand she responds with \n\n\u2018I just need space right now honestly\u2019 \nat this point i was pissed off because i don\u2019t know why she would need space from me if there than me confronting her about something and her not wanting to face it. \n\nL is very confrontational and a \u2018bad bitch\u2019 in her opinion. Every time i disagree with her and bring it up she yells, shit talks me, asks if i want to fight etc. I think it\u2019s because i\u2019m more of a submissive personality and she\u2019s more dominant, i also let people walk all over me until recently. I don\u2019t think she like me \u2018questioning\u2019 her. This whole situation pisses me off so much. \n\nAnd she also like to make sexual jokes towards me and M. She says she wants to have sex with M and me, has had sex with M (they haven\u2019t, he also used to play into it a lot until i made it known i didn\u2019t like it.), she wants to have sex with me (she\u2019s straight, both m and i are bi) or how she wants to be pounded by some celebrity. i\u2019ve told her so many times it\u2019s made me extremely uncomfortable but she hasn\u2019t stopped or even started right back up after i told her. i\u2019ve given up on telling her. It makes me really really uncomfortable and we can\u2019t even go a day/conversation without her bringing it up. it\u2019s annoying. \n\nalso she\u2019s said to me before that M is meaner to me because he knows i\u2019ll take it, but idk if that\u2019s true for him but definitely is true for her. I\u2019m so fed up with her throwing tantrums when she doesn\u2019t get her way (she despises her little sister for no reason and also has said she wants to throat punch her mom\u2014 her mom is a little mean and unreasonable but most of the things are normal mom things\u2014\u2014she also doesn\u2019t like authority and is never the problem. never.) Part of me wants to drop her and not deal with her but part of me wants to work it out. My school had a real lockdown today and i texted the group chat panicking it was an active shooter and she didn\u2019t even respond. It turned out that a student brought a gun on a college campus by my school. Two years ago the shooting at Great Mills happened, That was fifteen minutes from my school. My brother was in lockdown. I was scared because i remembered. I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t even want to talk to her anymore. \n\nalso i\u2019m sorry for the bad grammar and bad layout, i\u2019m on the bus home w my phone.\nI also have screenshots so 90% of the quotes are exact quotes", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

From 1-6 grade I really had no meaningful relationship with anyone besides my family,  no-one wanted to play with me and I was even bullied a little.  It is not that everyone disliked me, they just found me weird from what I can see. \n\n\nThen the two last years of primary school came,  I was put in a class for highly gifted individuals sincr my iq is 135 ( as you might be able to tell from this post I am not too happy with being this way ).  I met the best friend I ever had when I started life there.  For privacy reasons we'll call him alex.  Alex was a hyper-active kid and I was a bit more calm,  nonetheless we basically took each other under the wing and used to play everyday,  and I loved it.  Unfortunately his homesituation was awful in every way,  his father was abusive before he died and his mother was someone who sat in front of the computer all day,  smoking and complaining. We grew apart over these two years for reasons which probably contain this fact.  Now I do not talk to him at all anymore,  he was taken away from his mother as far as I know. \n\nThen secundary school came around,  six years were ahead of me and I was excited. This education level was the highest you could be so I was confident I'd make a lot of friends,  friends similar to alex. I unfortunately started acting like a hyper-active kid due to this excitement and people quickly began noticing that that was not really me.  The people started to hang out with were basically the leftovers and they even neglected me for the most part,  almost never inviting me to parties,  almost always saying no to hanging out. I just dealt with it because I had no other option. \n\nA few years pass and the group inevitably breaks apart,  I made one good friend from that group,  I would still call him a friend,  my best friend actually. Yet I don't think that he sees me as even close to that,  he never asks me to hang out,  he's made the suggestion maybe twice. He tells other people a lot of his problems but rarely comes to me. Oh well. \n\nSo I start hanging out with his clique and feel somewhat part of it at first. More and more people join the group somehow and I am once again left out, neglected and ignored. So it came as a surprise to me that a girl from the group suggested I came to her party as well.  Of course I'm all in and feel a slight rush at the idea of going to a party after four years of secundary school. I went,  and I enjoyed it,  some of the conversations that were had I couldn't really add to which I didn't mind,  that's normal. As it got later everyone got drunk,  I didn't drink and had clearly stated that I was not gonna drink so everything seemed completely fine,  and it was fun.  I was enjoying myself,  everyone was,  so it all seemed cool. \n\nAnother year passes and I still stay in that clique,  over this time period I hear them talk about all sorts of parties,  all sorts of moments where they all hangout together and i was not even told about it beforehand,  I am not really offended badly,  it happened before and has been so for ages,  nog big deal.  Over time I do however get a bit frustrated,  I tell them I'd like to go to a party as well,  it's been a while.  They responded with \"Well you don't drink so it's not even that enjoyable for you\" I disagre but don't let it become some furious argument so move on. \n\nMore time passes and a few realizations hit me; the hole I've been feeling is no depression,  it is loneliness,  the reason i got as to why I shouldn't party was sugarcoated bullshit,  they didn't want me there. \n\nThis frustration builds up over time and I start to feel bad about it,  I start to open up to my parents. They tell me they've known since the beginning of primary school. I feel a little better at firts but then the frustration worsens,  I open up to that one friend and another kid from the clique I'd become quite good friends with ( he also suffers from depression so opening up to him about mental health was easier ). Now the frustration is somewhat stable. \n\nThe second guy told me a lot about what he's seen,  we'll call him jack. Jack told me that people find me weird because of the way I think ( coming back to that iq shit ) and because of this no-one really wants to be close to me,  very few people actually dislike me but no-one really wants to be friends,  especially close friends. He also told me the people at the party found me weird because I didn't want to drink,  so fuck those people. \n\nAnd that is how my past basically repeats itself and honestly,  I see no light at the end of the tunnel. I've been thinking about if I want to live or not,  right now I have a life-goal yes,  but to keep walking this torturous path for that seems like it's not worth it. I don't think I will end my own life though. \n\nIf you read this far,  thank you. You're a kind person,  really.\n\nEdit: spelling", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I have been thinking that (obviously) you and me wouldn't have to search for each other for that long, but here I am. Looking for you.\n\nAnd yes, like you might have guessed right, I'm quite introverted, weird, but also casted out by my family. My partner lives far away from me. Don't get me wrong, reading classic books, writing shitty poems and watching tv shows on Netflix and daydreaming (!) almost all the time when I'm not at work, all of this is great. But, I want to know what kind of dreams you have, what scares you, what makes you laugh. I've noticed that people tend to like me, but they all think I'm too much to deal with, they pity me, because I don't have a great career. I haven't finished my master's degree, mostly due to serious mental problems, but I'm here, I'm fighting, I want to travel, see the Northern lights in Iceland, learn new things, be better at English and other languages I've tried to study for the last few years and most importantly, I don't want to climb trees alone.\n\nI've been to Japan, but I didn't enjoy my trip as I thought I would, because I didn't have a trustworthy person to talk to, so I remember wandering around Akihabara and staring at people, imagining what kind of life they have and..mostly, not enjoying my first and probably last visit in the country I have always wanted to see.\n\nOK, I'm not gonna lie, that's probably too clingy of me already, but I would love to talk to anybody, share my poems/thoughts with a kind, gentle soul. I like anime (like Paranoia Agent and recently my partner've shown me Mob Psycho 100), books (Ishiguro, Proust, Joyce changed my life), music (I like Joy Division, The Cure, Bowie, but I have to admit that I have been listening to crappy pop covers and low-key pretending that I am the person playing the ukulele alone in my room).\n\nI am also obsessed with cats. I used to brush my cats' teeth and read them Burroughs. I also liked to kiss their foreheads and say ''good-night'', so you get the idea what kind of person I am. I like art, I'm very bad at drawing, but I still l try to doodle a little, mainly small animals and my partner with me as ultimate soulmates (hey, don't judge me!).\n\nTell me about yourself!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

They\u2019ve all been with their partners for 10 years. All have bought homes. All have had the same job fresh out of college. \n\nI\u2019m not into sports, I have ran two businesses, I like dogs but prefer cats, I like wine, I don\u2019t watch a lot of Netflix. I\u2019ve moved around a lot, travelled a lot and have had 4 serious boyfriends in my 20\u2019s.\n\nI always knew I was different but I felt like we were a family and all loved each other equally. \n\nWell, that was naive of me because 3 out of the 5 have gotten married and they have all been each other\u2019s bridesmaids except me. Which was pretty awkward the first 2 times it happened! \n\nNow the 4th is engaged the one I felt the closest to and guess what! I\u2019m not a bridesmaid and I honestly just want to give up. I feel I\u2019ve invested a lot into my friends and I feel I\u2019m constantly getting left out. \n\nI expressed my feelings for feeling hurt I was not a bridesmaid and she was understanding but said \u2018we were just trying to keep it small\u2019.\n\nNow I\u2019m not an idiot. I know it\u2019s hard to make the decision who your bridesmaids should be but me and this girl are close so it\u2019s not unfair I feel hurt by this snub again. \n\nThey always plan surprises and gifts for each other but never for me. Even right now we are making this huge scrapbook for a girls 30th and have to write how much we love her and I\u2019m just over it. \n\nI\u2019m just an extra.

I'm actually new to reddit so I hope that you guys don't mind the long post ahead. I really need advice right now since I don't know what to feel anymore.\n\nI am a F, 22 years old and currently in college. I met my friend, \"J\", last year and basically we became great friends. He started off as a genuine, nice guy but as our friendship progresses and I got to know him well, it made me realize that despite his act of kindness towards us (his friends), he tends to shows off (in his defense, he said that he doesn't realize it), gets moody and angry easily when things doesn't go his way or something irritates him or someone doesn't agree with him. He also gets moody when people don't listen to him and most of all, degrades and makes us look like he is above us all. These are all observations that I got these past few months and I know that I shouldn't talk smack about him but i just want him to see that his attitude won't last long in the real world especially his friendships (his bestfriend and greatest friend already cut ties with him because of that) which led me to feel pity for him. From my perspective, it didn't mind me at first because we're all different and as long as it doesn't hurt anyone, it's fine by me but when he started to call me out and say that I'm the one who has a bad personality and kept telling me false accusations about myself then saying sorry afterwards cause his reason for that is because his \"hot headed\"? That's when I started to get irritated.\n\nI told our friends about what happened and what he did to me and apparently, HE DOES THIS TO EVERY ONE OF US. I was so dumbfounded that I ended up laughing. No wonder that guy, despite having lots of friends in the campus, no one wants to stay and hang out with him willingly. I really want to help him but \"J\" is stuck in his own world and kept asking me these questions:\n\n* Despite him being super nice to us, why don't we give the same amount of respect or nice-ness to him in return?\n* Why is the world so unfair to him?\n* Why does he have so many fake friends and why do some just keep ignoring him all together?\n\nI feel really bad for him and despite me being irritated with what he has done to me, I really want to help him. He's my friend after all. So any suggestions on how to deal and talk \"J\"? Thank you in advance!\n\nQUICK NOTE: Me and his friend already talked to him seriously regarding with this issue and he just fell on deaf ears. He kept telling us that he's not the problem which just added fuel to the fire for some of our friends including me.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Maybe your phonebook is not empty. Maybe you installed a lot of apps to chat/communicate. You\u2019ve done everything to come out to meet people's expectations.

What if you write, if you are interested in, if you listen, if you answer, if you share\u2026 and nothing.\n\nMany of you see the worst scenario in the lack of friends, but I can assure you that there is much more depressing situation if you know people and they don\u2019t care. When you look by hours on the phone and literally pray for the blinking led notification which says that someone remember about you., that someone cares. There are moments when sunlight reflected from phone screen or a crum on it light up your hopes so much you pick the phone with beating heart. It always ends sad, but for that silly moments of joy it is worth to delude oneself.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to find friends here as well as in different places on Reddit. I answered to posts, wrote private messages. But it all ended on nothing. Sometimes people just ignored me after the first couple of simple sentences.

Sometimes I\u2019ve heard that I\u2019m creepy because I don\u2019t have any other friends. \n\nI don\u2019t mind your skin color, age, gender, the fact from which part of the world you are, in what you believe in. I want to know it, I want to hear about it. As well as about your day, the book you've read or the worst movie you saw. I'm not a selfish talker.

Last year, he dated this awful girl who was basically abusive (verbally and mentally and emotionally) towards him, and because she hated me she told him that he couldn\u2019t be friends with me. He made me feel like shit and treated me like I didn\u2019t matter and like she was more important because she threw a temper tantrum every time she found out we were hanging out together. In turn, I hated her because of the whole situation and hated how he treated me- I felt like I didn\u2019t deserve to be treated like shit but then be the one he came running to every time she made his life hell. Fast forward a few months, they broke up and we\u2019re back to normal..... however, the whole situation triggered severe anxiety. Now, every time he\u2019s texting on his phone, or every time he has a break during class and I don\u2019t, or every time I\u2019m at work and I know he\u2019s not working, I\u2019m constantly worried that he\u2019s talking to another person or that he\u2019s going to find a way to replace me or abandon me. I\u2019m constantly in the mindset that he is intentionally looking for ways to replace me, or is set on finding another relationship and wants to hide it from me, but it\u2019ll come one day and he\u2019ll simply tell me we can\u2019t be friends anymore. Has my anxiety calmed down since last year? Yes. But is it still greatly affecting my daily life and my relationship with him? Yes.

From early teens to mid twenties I spent almost everyday with them, they were my brothers. We're in different life stages now, but most of us (4 out of 6) still all live in the same town. I am married, good job, wife, house, kid on the way, dogs, etc and am the only one in our group who is at that stage of life so now I'm at particularly saddening place with my friends. When I met my wife, I naturally started devoting time to her instead of my friends. Don't take this the wrong way, I still hung out with them all of the time, but now that we own a house together and are building a family I never see them. \n\nHere's the problem though, for a while I actively tried to hit them up to hang out. Sometimes they would, sometimes they couldn't, but I never (and still don't) get a phone call or text from them. I have always been the one to put myself out there to hang out and it never gets reciprocated back to me so I've started to fade away. If you can't put the same amount of energy into the friendship that I've been trying to, then why should I?\n\nIs anyone else dealing with something like this? I don't want to make new friends because I've never really had to and now it just seems impossible, but my wife hates this for me and so do I, but I don't really know what to do.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

It doesn't matter what it is, be it love, friendship, or a discord community .\"Sic Parvis Magna\" - Greatness from small beginnings. This discord intends to stay smaller (think: 30-40 people) with an emphasis on building long lasting relationships with people who are not only like-minded, but share an interest in genuinely connecting over time. If you're just passing through, this discord won't be ideal for you. We cannot promise you will meet girls/guys here who you will click with if that's also what you're looking for. Hopefully you're somebody who wants to make real friends, eventually meet up, talk everyday, etc. all that stuff.\n\nThe current members of the discord are from another discord, we know each other very well. What does this mean for you? Well, it means not only do we have this type of experience, but we will also do our best to connect with you. This means if you're a shy type, we don't care. Extrovert? Great, you'll fit right in. Some of us play games, some do not, this is definitely not that type of discord. Since we're talking about creating connections with people, we do expect you to be not only real, honest, but we hope that you are willing to voice as well. Why? Real connections occur when real effort is put out. Text is great, and often times we can only text, but we want to get to know you. Talking over voice is a good way to do this, and I believe that it's the only way to get really close to somebody.\n\nThis discord is very small currently, you will be here at the beginning (and hopefully) for a long time. If you're looking for a very active discord, this is not that currently, though eventually it will be. If you're looking for good friends, chattin shit, banter and finding people long term to talk to, meet, etc, this is for you. Some things about the people in here: We banter, a lot. We make dark jokes, we typically don't view things as sacred bar certain topics, we definitely expect you not to bully people, and we expect you to put actual effort in to creating connections as it's the whole point of this discord. Ideally you are: Genuine, can banter, will not disappear (if we see a lack of effort we will simply remove you.), would like to voice, not an internet personality, etc.\n\nplease PM me if you're interested, thanks.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Every monday, I go to therapy and usually I have lunch, before therapy, in what is a bookshop/restaurant. The food there is good enough and very cheap. Anyway, yesterday I went there and then saw if they had the translation I wanted of Swann's Way. They didn't but I still bought a book: Limonov by Carr\u00e8re. Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re is one of the greatest writers of contemporary French literature and I had heard his name, knew some of his works by name and had even read some articles by him, so I thought it was time to get to know more of his literary work. Limonov is a biographical novel about the life of Eduard Limonov, a poet, a writer and a fascist-ish Russian politician. It has been a quite interesting read: Limonov is despicable but his life was (and, I presume, still is) fascinating. Carr\u00e8re's writing is very honest. I do like buying books. I feel some kind of pleasure when I do. I buy books for many reasons: because I have heard of their authors, because of their publishing houses (yeah), because of their covers. I bought Limonov because of its cover and because I had heard of its author.\n\nThat's a paragraph I sent someone. That does summarize my life quite a bit: literature, therapy and France. I've loved France since I was a child (for real); I'm in therapy and I was recently diagnosed with Bipolar; and I love literature and I love writing. Last year, I was interning at a bank and I bought more than seventy books with my salary. I'm compulsive. I love Tolstoy, Faulkner, T.S. Eliot and many others; and I know I might sound arrogant because of this, so I should say I cried at Gossip Girl's finale. Really cried. I loved Gossip Girl. I also love Tintin. Why am I telling you this? Because you might love Tintin as well. Or you might be Belgian: if you are Belgian, please I thank you all for Tintin.\n\nBesides literature, being mentally ill, and having a love for France, I also have a bit of enthusiasm for cinema. I have helped to direct a short film and I just learned it is going to compete in a festival. I'm quite excited. I also just decided I want to study Anthropology in uni. I'm particularly fascinated by Africa. I'm quite excited. I also want to be a diplomat and for that I need to have command of the English language -- I've even thought about studying English abroad, somewhere like Australia, Ireland or New Zealand (if you're from these countries, I'd love to talk). I'd love to talk more about being mentally ill, about loving France (and not knowing French) and many others countries, about politics, literature, cinema, about Tintin and many other things. I'd love to share my writing, to exchange books and chocolate. I'd love you to be from anywhere, be you from India, Australia, France, Switzerland, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Suriname or Luxembourg.\n\nI'll leave you [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOVT74qDQIc) as a gift for reading everything.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

She could not be convinced. JUST BECAUSE OF MY SHORT HAIT!!!\n\nThis made me really sad and left me speechless. Can i do something? should i do something?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Let's start.\nLet's say as a kid (Elementary school) i was a total piece of shit: jealous, irrational and probably spoiled, a total piece of shit with people of my age but actually a decent human being with everyone else (parents, family, my friends). I didn't really see my behavior as problematic since  i was, in fact, a shithead and i didn't think much about it. I didn't remember until some months ago that actually i bullied one of my \"friends\" (i still feel guilty about it).\n\nIn Middle School i was cringy but not a piece of shit, just your typical Weaboo, maybe annoying, but still far better than before. In my Country i have 3 Years of Middle School, the Weaboo part was in the first Year, where i met \"Andrew\" and i met again two classmates from elementary school (the bullied one and the other one was more like an acquaintance, not really a friend). Me and Andrew were really close and we liked talking about all things, thanks to him i realized that my family wasn't the best; let's say that i live in a super religious (Muslim) family: A controlling and abusive mother, An enabler and violent father and decent-when-he-wants-to-be big brother (he's a wildcard, sometimes he's supportive and sometimes he's scarier than them). So back to the topic, i understood with him that me being beaten by them for every single error wasn't normal and i understood my behavior (Andrew didn't know about my behavior in elementary school). During a School trip i also met \"Clair\", who was talking with her friends about a videogame and i joined the conversation.\nSecond Year was better and worse at the same time, the good part is that i met \"Tim\" and \"Matt\", two friends who knew each other from elementary school, and joined our group. The worst part is that i started to use Andrew for venting and, honestly, it was bullying, it didn't beat him or humiliate him or bullshit like that, but i was always nervous and ready to insult (I remembered about this some week ago, i still feel guilty and i noticed that my mind makes me forget every bad thing i did because if i remember i'll just feel worse, i have so many regrets). He was obviously at his breaking point and he stopped talking to me, i instantly acknowledged the error and i started apologizing to him, it took days and we restarted talking and things. Third Year was development for everyone. The group was close but my family was way worse, my mother started creeping me out about \"marrying my cousin\" and i felt at my breaking point, i spent almost all my evenings venting with Andrew, this time not insulting him, but asking for support, he helped me a lot and i noticed that i never believed in Islam (i am Agnostic).\nAt the end of middle school i never felt better. Really. Just remembering these days makes me cry of joy.\n\nNow let's move on to High School (5 Years, but i'll only talk about the first two years since there is the important stuff, and i didn't still finish the second year). Honestly, i became more reserved in this years, for the fear of becoming like in middle school, people thought i was introverted so that's probably the right term, the strange thing is that at a point i was used to be myself outside school and a melancholic teen in School. Now the big shit starts:\n\"Carl\" joins the group, he's Andrew's childhood friend and i actually knew him a little in Middle School, but he did another school and honestly i didn't really care about him to ask him to go out, still, i didn't dislike his presence and he was welcome in the group. At first it went pretty well, he enjoyed being with Tim, Andrew and Clair, with Matt he was quite neutral but he hated me, not joking, at the time my humor was quite bad (and still) but i don't understand the irrational hate he had for me, honestly he's smart so i doubt it's the jealousy crap like in TV series, but i was fine, we were just incompatible. What really made me mad is that he tried (and made it almost with success) to ban me from the group and make everyone hate me: Clair disliked him, Andrew enabled his behavior, Tim was stupid enough to believe him and Matt was... Here. So he failed and then, nothing. Some months later he left the group because he was arguing with someone in the group and since he was wrong and he couldn't accept it he just disappeared, honestly i was fine. He kept contact with the people he enjoyed being with, and i was totally fine since know they trust me and i didn't betray them. Meanwhile, not a lot passes and he returns, probably better than before, especially with me, we didn't get along well but he wasn't a jerk anymore, so it was ok.\nClair meets \"Sarah\", and she spends a lot of time with her, and she even develops feelings for her (no one is homophobic and actually, i shipped them lmao). Every time we go out or talk she talks about Sarah and how she's funny and kind; honesty i was curious to meet her, and in an occasion, with Matt (Matt is quite particular, he has highhills and downhills with everyone, he's the crazy friend), i go in Clair's house (i can't go usually in houses, since my family thinks that every nonmuslim adult is a rapist) and finally meet Sarah, she was funny and when i returned home with her she asked me about my sexual orientation and she told me she's straight; nothing against her but i felt quite bad for Clair, but still, i appreciated how Sarah rejected her and still remained friends with her, their relationship didn't even change. At May, looking in my Discord server, j notice a person i didn't remember and i ask them the name, she was Mary, Clair's friend who i heard a little about some year ago, we talked and noticed we have a lot in common, weeks passed and she tells me she was bullied by Sarah and she had two terrible months, between abusive parents and Sarah in class with her. Honestly i didn't want to cause any drama, so i I comforted her and become more distant from Sarah, involuntarily, but not harsh towards her. My birthday arrives and i have an issue inviting  Sarah or Mary, since i was scared that if i invited both they will be upset, and i eventually consider not inviting neither of them, so no one will be angry to me; but some day they tell me how now they're friends so i invite everyone and we spend a good time. Some days later i have to travel outside the country but i keep in contact with them. This is where the downhill starts.\nTim and Sarah become a couple, only because they thought the other was attractive and they were desperate but... Good for them, Clair wasn't an issue since she was surprisingly mature and was actually happy about them, the only issue was that the couple lasted a few days i believe...? Y'know the stuff now... Teenagers drama... Instagram status... Sarah's Instagram White knights attack Tim but he didn't really do anything bad, Tim was sick because Sarah was really whiny and annoying so he convinced her to break the couple and she actually agreed with him. The group starts splitting.\n\n- Tim and Mary\n\n- Sarah\n\nCarl was with Tim, since he didn't really care and he chooses by sympathy and everyone else was pretty much neutral.\nNow here i miss informations but a call happened without me where Andrew and Carl (idk why Carl swapped sides) start to insult Tim and he isolate himself. So i choose to stay in Tim group to support them, but without knowing i took a side, i just wanted to be neutral too. Time passes, Second High School Year and more drama happens. Tim and Mary make fun of Sarah's English at school and Sarah constantly harasses Mary with Instagram fake accounts.\nI was going through other family shit and i saw the situation at the end, i restarted talking to Andrew, my first friend, the person who knows everything about me, and he let me open the eyes, how even Tim had faults, he was a piece of shit with Matt and sometimes everyone in the group even before the drama.\nI convinced myself to stay neutral and join both groups, ignore the drama and enjoy the friendship...Failure.\nAt School i was a better human being, i reason, and try to be empathetic, from Andrew i understood how being a good person really helps (really, i never felt something like unconditional love before the group, it was the place where everyone accepted me). I didn't accept the death of that place and i tried to rebuild the group (i'm dumb i know)... Second failure! I start to see how Sarah tells them fake things about me just because she despise me and recently i found her harassing Mary again, and since \"I AM NEUTRAL\" i should not stop her, hey hun, i'm neutral but because i care about my friends, so it's obvious that i want to stop you from harassing my friend. The only person in my opinion that can really hate Sarah is Mary, who has PTSD from that episodes (she needs support, really.) Tim and Sarah started the drama, Tim continued and now Sarah continues and enjoys it. I'm even sick of people like Matt, who just enjoy try to find an excuse to scream at me, and Andrew is a fucking enabler, but i love him damn. Clair is the only mature one, and i'm still friend with her, but she's busy at school and she's going through some alone moment so i don't want to disturb her in these days, i just to do like her, ignore them. But everytime i try to ignore them more i notice that my days are empty without calls with them, i mean, i have hobbies but... I preferred calls for a long time. Today i reached my straw point with Tim, an edgy entitled teen, and Mary, who is a very kind person, who i want to remain friends with but i'm scared she'll convince me to return to Tim. Now i expected to say something like \"fuck them\" but honestly... Fuck myself. I noticed now that besides Clair, Mary, to a less extent Andrew and online friends i have no one. I ruined my relationships, i can't maintain friends, i'm just the failure of elementary school. Just the same. I'm quite sad now. I think i'll just eat some biscuit and try to forget this post.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

She\u2019s a vocalist, and I\u2019m an instrumentalist). \n\nI listened closely this time, and heard that the trumpet was very flat in the background, and that sort of ruined it for me.

(Just for background, we used to work together, so we were good friends, and when she needed a place to live, I suggested that she move into my house, as I had spare rooms.)  \n\n\nSo, my housemate M, can be quite frosty and rude to my friends when they come over. I don't have guests over very often, btw, but she's not actually very nice to them. They try to talk to her, and she either ignores them completely, or gives one or two-word replies. Her friends, on the other hand, come over more often than mine, and she has them over for meals, etc more than I do with my friends, and I am always welcoming and nice to them, they're guests in my home (I'm nice to everyone, though) and some of her friends, I hang out with them too, as they're great people and we get along really well.   \n\n\nMy best friend R, she has no hot water in her house, her gas ran out. I offered for her to use my shower a few nights a week, rather than her boiling the jug and filling up the tub with pots of hot water. I, of course, ran this past M from the beginning and she was totally on board with this and seemed fine with the arrangement (she's a single mother also, so she understands the money struggles sometimes)  \n\n\nEverything was fine until this morning, out of the blue M came to me and said she felt awkward having R in the house and it made her feel uncomfortable in her own home. I've just had a very painful conversation with my best friend, trying to explain to her how M feels, but also keep the peace. R had three showers at my house. Three showers over the space of two and a half weeks, so one night a week she was here. She was always quick, she didn't waste our time or take up space or anything, she was quick in and out. Also, M and I have separate bathrooms. She doesn't even use the shower that R was using.   \n\n\nWhile we were talking, R told me that M had been quite rude to her. She had been cold and had ignored her when she tried to talk to her. I apologised, as she had felt uncomfortable as a guest in my home, and to me, that is the worst thing. I hate the thought of people being uncomfortable in my home environment. I want all guests to feel welcome and at ease. I want my home to be a safe zone. After that conversation, I realised it wasn't the first time a friend of mine had made a comment about M or asked if she liked them. She's been cold to my friends before.   \n\n\nShould I bring this up with M? Do I tell her that my friends feel uncomfortable around her because she gives off frosty vibes?

We\u2019ve had others come and join our group and others leave over the years but it has always constantly been us 4. Recently 2 of us left for college and 2 stayed behind for high school, this isn\u2019t really an issue though as most of our time hanging out is either online video games or getting together for a movie or event. \n\nOver the years I (m) fell pretty hard for a friend (f) that was in our group of 4. We\u2019ll call her, After a few months of sitting on our feelings we both confessed we were into each other and began dating. It lasted for a few really great months but eventually ended (that\u2019s to say, I was dumped and this is what I was told) due to myself going off to college and her still being in high school, as there was a slight age difference. It\u2019s currently been about 2 and a half months since the break up, and she has started to date another guy from the group of 4.\n\nOverall I think I took it pretty easily, I\u2019ve had appropriate time to grieve the relationship and move on.

It's really long too. I'm sorry in advance.\n\nTo give a little background on my friend and I. She's my best friend and we have been online friends for 8 years. We have never met but we have talked about it. We're both in our early twenties but she is older than me by a year. Both females.\n\nWe live about 7 hours away from each other, give or take. She is my absolute best friend. We tell each other \"I love you, good night\" nearly every night. We text non stop all day and there's been countless nights where we stayed up all night texting each other. We have so many shared interests. I would call her my soul sister, we just get each other that much.We have never really videochatted but of course with Snapchat we send pictures from time to time, but we mostly text. Believe me, we aren't catfishing each other lol.\n\nSo here's where it gets kinda tricky. My estranged father passed away last year. I told her amidst my tears because I had to talk to someone. And she said, \"Omg, I'm so sorry! Btw I'm going to go the movies with my dad and brother 4\" It was an hour before 4. It really hurt but honestly I was so caught up with other emotions that it really didn't hit me how insensitive that was. It wasn't until about a few days later it hit me and it was a complete what the fuck moment? \n\nEvery birthday of her's I've made sure to give her a long and sentimental birthday message at midnight. Every single year. Never once have I been told happy birthday at midnight from her. In fact, the past few years she's gone to bed early. Of course this is petty for me to be hurt because I'm not entitled to birthday messages at midnight. However last year it hurt me so badly that my own best friend who is nearly my entire world couldn't wish me a happy birthday at midnight...someone that I love so much and someone who means so much to me couldn't go out of her way not even once to tell me happy birthday at midnight...that I tried killing myself. It didn't work obviously but I went on about my night and day like normal. She didn't wish me a happy birthday until Facebook notified her (I know this bc at the same time she texted me it I got a notification for my other account's birthday was that day). It hurt. I have a lot of depression with my birthday besides everything with my friend. \n\nLately she's gone to 2 concerts this year that were literally in my state. Not even 2 hours away from me. And she never even mentioned stopping by. It broke my heart. The first time I was supposed to go to the concert but about a week before she told me that her sister was going to go instead. It really helped them bond as sisters because before that they weren't so close. They're extremely close after the concert. It makes me so jealous. Then a few months later she went back up to another concert and didn't even mention meeting me. It just broke me down. I didn't feel good enough, I felt so unimportant. \n\nShe just got a boyfriend and they've only been dating not even 72 hours and she's told me how she plans on meeting him in January. It caught me off guard so quick. Wait? January?? You'd meet a guy you haven't even known 8 days over your best friend you haven't known 8 years. That was today and I was *so* close to going off on her. It just really hurt me to my core. I felt so betrayed. She'd really meet a guy she hasn't even known a week but hasn't even attempted to meet me in the 8 years of us knowing each other? As a side note, she has a job where right now meeting each other the ball is in her court. I want to meet her so fucking bad. Just to see her in life and talk to her and laugh. She'd put DICK over meeting her best friend first? Edit: and YES I'm jealous. Not because she has a boyfriend and I don't, but because she's already ignoring my messages to text him. It's so fucking hurtful. She'll leave my facebook message unopened for hours but I see that she's constantly on Snapchat. She and her boyfriend only text on Snapchat (if that tells you enough about how much he cares about her). But that just makes me worry that she's going to eventually completely ignore me. I don't want our friendship to end over because of her getting into a relationship and putting all her time into texting him. However, he doesn't seem that into her. They aren't FB friends and they don't follow each other on Instagram. Only Snapchat and she's already complained to me about him and how he hasn't texted her because he has classes and homework or that he got distracted by youtube instead of messaging her back. I've confided into one of my other friends (they don't know each other) and she thinks they won't last long. I agree. But it still makes me worry that we'll grow apart. \n\nOverall, I have a lot of resentment toward her over everything but I haven't told her. I don't want to hurt our strong friendship. I love her so much that I truly cannot imagine my life without her. Should I look past everything and stay friends while keeping my mouth shut? Or should I just tell her how I feel and potentially ruin our 8 year long friendship?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Let's start.\nLet's say as a kid (Elementary school) i was a total piece of shit: jealous, irrational and probably spoiled, a total piece of shit with people of my age but actually a decent human being with everyone else (parents, family, my friends). I didn't really see my behavior as problematic since  i was, in fact, a shithead and i didn't think much about it. I didn't remember until some months ago that actually i bullied one of my \"friends\" (i still feel guilty about it).\n\nIn Middle School i was cringy but not a piece of shit, just your typical Weaboo, maybe annoying, but still far better than before. In my Country i have 3 Years of Middle School, the Weaboo part was in the first Year, where i met \"Andrew\" and i met again two classmates from elementary school (the bullied one and the other one was more like an acquaintance, not really a friend). Me and Andrew were really close and we liked talking about all things, thanks to him i realized that my family wasn't the best; let's say that i live in a super religious (Muslim) family: A controlling and abusive mother, An enabler and violent father and decent-when-he-wants-to-be big brother (he's a wildcard, sometimes he's supportive and sometimes he's scarier than them). So back to the topic, i understood with him that me being beaten by them for every single error wasn't normal and i understood my behavior (Andrew didn't know about my behavior in elementary school). During a School trip i also met \"Clair\", who was talking with her friends about a videogame and i joined the conversation.\nSecond Year was better and worse at the same time, the good part is that i met \"Tim\" and \"Matt\", two friends who knew each other from elementary school, and joined our group. The worst part is that i started to use Andrew for venting and, honestly, it was bullying, it didn't beat him or humiliate him or bullshit like that, but i was always nervous and ready to insult (I remembered about this some week ago, i still feel guilty and i noticed that my mind makes me forget every bad thing i did because if i remember i'll just feel worse, i have so many regrets). He was obviously at his breaking point and he stopped talking to me, i instantly acknowledged the error and i started apologizing to him, it took days and we restarted talking and things. Third Year was development for everyone. The group was close but my family was way worse, my mother started creeping me out about \"marrying my cousin\" and i felt at my breaking point, i spent almost all my evenings venting with Andrew, this time not insulting him, but asking for support, he helped me a lot and i noticed that i never believed in Islam (i am Agnostic).\nAt the end of middle school i never felt better. Really. Just remembering these days makes me cry of joy.\n\nNow let's move on to High School (5 Years, but i'll only talk about the first two years since there is the important stuff, and i didn't still finish the second year). Honestly, i became more reserved in this years, for the fear of becoming like in middle school, people thought i was introverted so that's probably the right term, the strange thing is that at a point i was used to be myself outside school and a melancholic teen in School. Now the big shit starts:\n\"Carl\" joins the group, he's Andrew's childhood friend and i actually knew him a little in Middle School, but he did another school and honestly i didn't really care about him to ask him to go out, still, i didn't dislike his presence and he was welcome in the group. At first it went pretty well, he enjoyed being with Tim, Andrew and Clair, with Matt he was quite neutral but he hated me, not joking, at the time my humor was quite bad (and still) but i don't understand the irrational hate he had for me, honestly he's smart so i doubt it's the jealousy crap like in TV series, but i was fine, we were just incompatible. What really made me mad is that he tried (and made it almost with success) to ban me from the group and make everyone hate me: Clair disliked him, Andrew enabled his behavior, Tim was stupid enough to believe him and Matt was... Here. So he failed and then, nothing. Some months later he left the group because he was arguing with someone in the group and since he was wrong and he couldn't accept it he just disappeared, honestly i was fine. He kept contact with the people he enjoyed being with, and i was totally fine since know they trust me and i didn't betray them. Meanwhile, not a lot passes and he returns, probably better than before, especially with me, we didn't get along well but he wasn't a jerk anymore, so it was ok.\nClair meets \"Sarah\", and she spends a lot of time with her, and she even develops feelings for her (no one is homophobic and actually, i shipped them lmao). Every time we go out or talk she talks about Sarah and how she's funny and kind; honesty i was curious to meet her, and in an occasion, with Matt (Matt is quite particular, he has highhills and downhills with everyone, he's the crazy friend), i go in Clair's house (i can't go usually in houses, since my family thinks that every nonmuslim adult is a rapist) and finally meet Sarah, she was funny and when i returned home with her she asked me about my sexual orientation and she told me she's straight; nothing against her but i felt quite bad for Clair, but still, i appreciated how Sarah rejected her and still remained friends with her, their relationship didn't even change. At May, looking in my Discord server, j notice a person i didn't remember and i ask them the name, she was Mary, Clair's friend who i heard a little about some year ago, we talked and noticed we have a lot in common, weeks passed and she tells me she was bullied by Sarah and she had two terrible months, between abusive parents and Sarah in class with her. Honestly i didn't want to cause any drama, so i I comforted her and become more distant from Sarah, involuntarily, but not harsh towards her. My birthday arrives and i have an issue inviting  Sarah or Mary, since i was scared that if i invited both they will be upset, and i eventually consider not inviting neither of them, so no one will be angry to me; but some day they tell me how now they're friends so i invite everyone and we spend a good time. Some days later i have to travel outside the country but i keep in contact with them. This is where the downhill starts.\nTim and Sarah become a couple, only because they thought the other was attractive and they were desperate but... Good for them, Clair wasn't an issue since she was surprisingly mature and was actually happy about them, the only issue was that the couple lasted a few days i believe...? Y'know the stuff now... Teenagers drama... Instagram status... Sarah's Instagram White knights attack Tim but he didn't really do anything bad, Tim was sick because Sarah was really whiny and annoying so he convinced her to break the couple and she actually agreed with him. The group starts splitting.\n\n- Tim and Mary\n\n- Sarah\n\nCarl was with Tim, since he didn't really care and he chooses by sympathy and everyone else was pretty much neutral.\nNow here i miss informations but a call happened without me where Andrew and Carl (idk why Carl swapped sides) start to insult Tim and he isolate himself. So i choose to stay in Tim group to support them, but without knowing i took a side, i just wanted to be neutral too. Time passes, Second High School Year and more drama happens. Tim and Mary make fun of Sarah's English at school and Sarah constantly harasses Mary with Instagram fake accounts.\nI was going through other family shit and i saw the situation at the end, i restarted talking to Andrew, my first friend, the person who knows everything about me, and he let me open the eyes, how even Tim had faults, he was a piece of shit with Matt and sometimes everyone in the group even before the drama.\nI convinced myself to stay neutral and join both groups, ignore the drama and enjoy the friendship...Failure.\nAt School i was a better human being, i reason, and try to be empathetic, from Andrew i understood how being a good person really helps (really, i never felt something like unconditional love before the group, it was the place where everyone accepted me). I didn't accept the death of that place and i tried to rebuild the group (i'm dumb i know)... Second failure! I start to see how Sarah tells them fake things about me just because she despise me and recently i found her harassing Mary again, and since \"I AM NEUTRAL\" i should not stop her, hey hun, i'm neutral but because i care about my friends, so it's obvious that i want to stop you from harassing my friend. The only person in my opinion that can really hate Sarah is Mary, who has PTSD from that episodes (she needs support, really.) Tim and Sarah started the drama, Tim continued and now Sarah continues and enjoys it. I'm even sick of people like Matt, who just enjoy try to find an excuse to scream at me, and Andrew is a fucking enabler, but i love him damn. Clair is the only mature one, and i'm still friend with her, but she's busy at school and she's going through some alone moment so i don't want to disturb her in these days, i just to do like her, ignore them. But everytime i try to ignore them more i notice that my days are empty without calls with them, i mean, i have hobbies but... I preferred calls for a long time. Today i reached my straw point with Tim, an edgy entitled teen, and Mary, who is a very kind person, who i want to remain friends with but i'm scared she'll convince me to return to Tim. Now i expected to say something like \"fuck them\" but honestly... Fuck myself. I noticed now that besides Clair, Mary, to a less extent Andrew and online friends i have no one. I ruined my relationships, i can't maintain friends, i'm just the failure of elementary school. Just the same. I'm quite sad now. I think i'll just eat some biscuit and try to forget this post.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Overall i'm new to having online friends but it's so much fun for me to meet people from around the world \ud83d\ude01\n\nSo... A bit about me. I'm a 22yo guy from germany. I study mechanical engineering. I'm really interested in everything technical. I'm a dog person (i have a Labrador) but overall i love all animals. I wouldnt describe myself as introverted but also not as extroverted. I have no problems talking to new people. But i have a hard time making new friends. Not that i dont have any friends. I have a good amount of friends but it would still be nice to be in contact with even more as friendship and the contact to people means extremely much to me. I also love to help others. Idk it just feels so good to help someone during a hard time knowing i was helping them to get over it. I know i can sometimes be a bit intrusive with it. Then please just tell me to stop.\nAlso i dont take myself too serious. I can have serious conversations but i can also joke around or be sarcastic (and i love bad memes).\nTo end the talking about me: Here are 3 topics i could talk for hours about.\n1. Music. I'm mostly a Metalhead but i basicalls listen and sing to everything that comes up to the radio when in a good mood \ud83d\ude01\n2. Movies and TV shows. I watch way too many. I just LOVE trash movies. I'm also into action, thriller, horror, anime (not so much of that lately) etc. Basically everything. My top 3 are Memento, Inception and Green Book. But if you ask me for my favorites without a number limit you will get a list that goes from here to the moon.\n3. Motorcycles. My biggest hobby and i spend way too much money on it. I change my bike every year. Right now i'll have a Triumph. Have also been to the racetrack some times.\n\nSo what i'm looking for. Preferably someone from europe (time zones. But all are welcome). Germany or something near germany would be awesome because i would love to meet irl if we become good friends. Someone who also shares my interests or at least wants to learn about them. Someone who is also looking for a longer term friendship. Also preferably female because i already have a lot of male friend in real life and also out of the online friends i met so far i clicked faster with my female friends. But all are welcome.\nAlso who is into voice messages because its just a lot of fun for me to actually talk rather then text. And someone who doesnt think of themself as being not interesting. Come on everyone is interesting in some way so dont think that bad about yourself. \n\nSo... That was a pretty long text and probably not too many people will read it or answer to it. But if you did and are interested in getting to know each other then leave me a message.\nI also have KIK (till it shuts down), Snapchat, Discord and Whatsapp (i give my number out after we chatted a bit).

I live on a mixed floor of about 20 people that I didn\u2019t know before moving here so we all made friends with each other. First semester was really great; we all got along so well and I became pretty close with three other girls on the floor, one of them in particular (we even travelled a little bit during the mid year holidays). I really felt I clicked with these people and for a while I felt really relaxed and secure in my place in the friendship circle.\n\nSemester 2 has been a lot tougher. I suppose it kinda started when I started a \u2018thing\u2019 with one of the guys on the floor and now it\u2019s turned into dating. End of semester 1, turned out we both liked each other and we wanted to see where it could go but also didn\u2019t feel comfortable telling everyone bc \u2018floorcesting\u2019 is frowned upon. Fast forward about 2 months into semester 2 and the truth about us came out in a really ugly way, thanks to these girls. I\u2019d snuck off with this guy on a night out and the girls overacted about my safety even after I said I was ok. This turned into a massive fight which dug up a lot of surprised problems we had. I was made to feel as if the whole thing was my fault and I\u2019d betrayed them, not bc I didn\u2019t tell them about him, but bc they thought I didn\u2019t care or respect them. I couldn\u2019t defend myself against anything they said, I could only accept what they were saying. I apologised profusely for anything they brought up, simply wanting everything to just go back to being friends. But they told me we could never be like the way we were before, and the girl I was particularly close to didn\u2019t know whether she could be friends with me anymore. This was roughly a month ago. Since then, I have been working my butt off to reconnect with them and honestly I thought I was making some ground.\n\nTo make matters more complicated, a new girl joined the floor this semester. Really lovely girl and we get on pretty well. However, because there was some distance between myself and the other girls, she\u2019s ended up getting closer with them and making me feel like I\u2019m being replaced. I\u2019ve been noticing over the last couple of weeks I\u2019ve been subtly excluded from things. Concerts, photos, not enough seats in a car, breakfast at a cafe. Nothing big, but just enough to feel a little hurt.\n\nNow for what just happened to prompt this post. To pick who you live with next year at college, you form a quad of 4 rooms and then that quad is put with other quads to form a floor. We have to submit these preferences to the college before the end of the month. This has been causing my a lot of stress and anxiety recently bc obviously I can count and there\u2019s too many people for 4 rooms. I brought it up with two of the girls about a week ago, asking if they\u2019ve thought of their preferences yet. They told me not yet, recognising the awkward position we have. This was a relief for me. I thought ok there\u2019s still time we can talk about this and figure something out.\n\nYesterday, the girl I was close to and the new girl came into my room and told me they had already organised and submitted their quad a while ago and, obviously, I wasn\u2019t in it. They did this before I had spoken to the other girls. \n\nI am absolutely devastated. I don\u2019t have that many friends at college, and not enough to form a another quad with. I saw this coming but thought we were going to talk about it like adults BEFORE they did anything. I thought we could work something out so no one was left out, form a three and a two instead of one quad or agree for someone to not be in the quad but be on the same floor. It seems they were not interested in doing this. They went behind my back to get the choice they wanted regardless of me and now they\u2019ve told me when I don\u2019t have a choice in the matter. As a courtesy or something.\n\nIf you\u2019ve somehow still reading this long post, am I right to be upset? Am I overreacting? Do these people care about me at all? Is it worth trying to negotiate to be with them? Is it even worth trying to be friends with them after they treated me like this? Any advice would be great, I need other perspectives cause right now I can\u2019t help blaming myself for absolutely everything.\n\nThank you", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

While we never fought there were times she really disrespected me as a friend and I shrugged it off. \n\nMe and her would always be single and go out and party on the weekends until she met a guy named John. He was 4 years younger than her and couldn't even get into a bar yet. I told her dont waste her time but she went out with him anyways. After that I started seeing her less and less until it was weeks since we hung out. She was so stuck on her boyfriend that I didn't exist in her mind. Even when we hung out he would always have to be there with us. I got the feeling he didn't like me because every time I went to her house he would ignore me or not even acknowledge I was around. They ended up staying together for 4 years he even moved in with her. So a couple years later she called me in tears telling me John cheated on her. I ran to her to console my best friend and respected her decision to take him back or let him go. (which was never a thought, she forgave him the same day) She finally gave him a ultimatum and said either marry her or leave. Two weeks later he proposed to her and their wedding was in 5 months. She was the ultimate bridzilla had to control everything!! For their wedding gift I decided to be nice and give her a beautiful wedding cake due to the fact they didn't have a lot of money for a fancy wedding and I worked at a bakery. I told them it would be my gift to them and not to worry. She picked up the design and the cake ended up costing me $300 and $125 for white roses to be added to it. Not to mention another $200 for the bridesmaids dress and $100 towards a vacation trip the bridal party were going to give to them at their reception. So her wedding came and went and it was beautiful she looked so happy and I was so proud to be apart of her wedding. \n\nA year later it was my turn to be a bride and have the wedding of my dreams. I was going to make her a bridesmaid but she ended up getting pregnant three weeks before I got proposed to which was all about her again. I decided she would feel uncomfortable being 9 months pregnant and standing up in my wedding so I excluded her to just come and be a guest and enjoy the day. While I planned my wedding me and her grew apart I was busy working 50 hours a week and planning my wedding while she was excited to start preparations for her baby. We didn't talk really except for on Facebook when we commented on each others stuff. My wedding comes and while I got ready she snuck up to see me and we both cried and hugged each other. Throughout my wedding I didn't really see her much but kept running up to her father at the bar getting as many free drinks as he can hold. My wedding turned out gorgeous and the very next day I was opening up my gifts and cards writing down who gave me what and so on.. when we came to the end I checked my list and to my surprise my best friend didn't give me a card and neither did her parents. I was confused and thought maybe they got stuck in the wedding card box or I lost them. There was no way they came to my wedding and didnt bring me at least a card.. I spoke with her a day after and the first thing she said to me was she FORGOT to bring the card when they left and she would mail it to me since I would be on my honeymoon for a week. Well its been almost 5 months since that day and HAVE NOT GOTTEN A CARD OR ANYTHING! Also her husband never came with her or her parents to my wedding. I felt very disrespected!  I was extremely angry that they think of me as family but come to my wedding without even bringing me a card that says congratulations when I spent a lot of time making sure things for her wedding were perfect. I was so hurt and so angry that I haven't spoken to her since. Now she keeps messaging me on Facebook and texting me to come see her baby but I really dont want anything to do with her. My husband was super angry at her as well and told me not to speak with her again. I been friends with her for 10 years and now I feel like I lost my best friend but I really dont want to be her friend anymore. Am I wrong? Please help.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Not because it was ordained by any external creed, internal insecurity, or lack of option, but because it was their informed-choice to do so; their way of demonstrating that future devotion. I still believe in such a person. \n\nHowever, it seems the only other people who follow a similar-model to myself are those who do so due to religious-practice (I'm agnostic), those who have issues with intimacy (been to therapists; they say that isn't the case) or those simply haven't had the opportunity to get intimate with another (I've had offers). \n\nI'm here to see if there is some sort of community for people like me, or others who might feel the same way I do (i.e. reserving physical intimacy due to non-religious values). \n\nNot really here to get into a debate; just trying to find other people like myself.

I confided in this friend and told her that I really wanted to talk to her about something and that it was serious, and she goes ahead and says \"Okay  I promise I'll listen to you and ACTUALLY try to give you some decent advice.\" I was taken aback mostly because... well... was she doing this for me or for herself? For herself to make her look like a good friend? \n\nAlong with the hard times, I experienced suicidal ideation. I'm really close with my family and one day we took a day trip to the city. I'm a city gal and my family is #1 in my heart so hypothetically I shouldve been very happy that day. But I wasnt , and i couldnt explain why. We were waiting for the train and it approached, i had a brief scenario in my head of jumping. I told my friend that i couldnt udnerstand why on such a happy day, i was having thoughts of suicide. And she compares it to her relationship with her older sister, always getting the spotlight, and how she resented her sister.. Which in turn, spoiled her mood everywhere they went together. So she told me she understood how I felt. In my mind, these two things have nothing in common and it made me feel rejected and like my problem was a small thing.\n\nAnd this is basically how it's like every single time I tried confiding in her. She always compares, and makes the story about herself. That's not what I need, I honestly need some tender, loving, care yknow??? \n\nAnyway, I'm thinking of slowly detaching myself from her for more reasons than one.

I recognized him immediately, he'd been all over the local papers for stealing a ton of money from customers of a business he worked for. Which is probably why she delayed introducing us. \n\nI decided to look past his recent past but I couldnt. We were on a couples date, my husband and I with the two of them. At the restaurant Matt ordered the same thing I did, he literally said \"I'll have what shes having\". Meal came, it was delicious, Matt even commented how good it was. \nWhen the bill came he tried telling the waitress he wasnt paying because she brought him the wrong meal. Uhhh...  she apologized and explained only a manager could help. When she walked away he winked and said \"I call it the Matt Coupon\". When the manager came over I immediately apologized and said Matt was mistaken, he thought he ordered his usually but ordered what I did and everything was perfect. Yeah Matt was sour, I didnt care.\n\nAfter this my friend insists on ALWAYS having him come along because \"I love that we are all friends!\"...\n\nWe all went to a concert where he sat complaining that there was a guy there who he didnt like IN HIGH SCHOOL! We are all mid 30s. \n\nShe brought Matt along to a game night I was having at my house. My neighbors and other friends were all over and playing Cards Against Humanity. Half way through Matt stands up and yells at my neighbor \"you're a cheater and I'm leaving!\" Then went to lay on my couch about 5 feet away and said he was taking a nap. No alcohol was involved people!! I told my friend they would need to leave. \n\nI have since stopped inviting her to things. I did tell her I was uncomfortable with his behavior and felt like maybe we should just hang out when she had free time. Yeah I thought she took the hint. I was wrong:\n\nI recently invited her to my house for a gathering. It isnt for another week. Just yesterday we grabbed coffee together and as we were parting she said \"I hope you're making those spicy meatballs for the party, Matt LOVES them\" then she shut her car door.\n\nAhhh!!!!

{"post_id": "dh6m0h", "created_utc": 1570945267, "title": "Friend complaining about me to my friends instead of coming to me.", "author": "Rosie1711", "self_text": "Hi everyone,\n\nThanks in advance for taking the time to read this.\n\nI'm considering cutting a friendship but wanted your advice on whether I am being too harsh.\n\nSo after going through a difficult breakup, I moved in with a friend for a few months until my home was built.\n\nThis also helped my friend out as I was paying for half of all the bills and on many occasions I not only paid for half of the groceries but I would often buy food for a number of recipes she insisted on making from scratch, which wasn't cheap for me on a strict budget with a child to support and needing to put away for household items.\n\nI often had to work to her schedule and I cooked a lot of the meals the majority of nights which created stress for my routine, as with a child, I didn't always have the time to cook meals completely from scratch every night. I also done the majority of the entire housework, including her washing and folding her laundry and prepping food for when her friends came over. She would return the favour on occasion by helping me fold my laundry, I always showed my gratitude buying her chocolate, wine or presents to say thanks for having me stay.\n\nI was extremely grateful for her helping me with a place to stay and was more than happy to show this doing these things. After a while, I sometimes felt taken for granted as I was often left to do washing up from her cooking for her lunches and breakfast.\n\nAnyway fast forward some time later and I was confronted by another friend of mine (who I had introduced my former house mate to and they now were friends) who proceeded to lecture me for not being in touch with my former house mate much since I moved out. I had been dealing with medical issues and found out I had a serious health issue, which I have now recovered from but at the time I had a lot of appointments and was needing a lot of rest. \n\nI was asked on two occasions to catch up with my former house mate but on those occasions I had medical appointments and the times I was free she wasn't. I explained this to my other friend and told them I also tried to make plans to catch up but they were also busy. Despite this my other friend disregarded tgis and continued to put all of the blame on me and despite me explaining what I had been dealing with, I was shown no empathy or compassion but only attacked further. The friend I had lived with told my other friend, they had their life thrown into complete chaos when I stayed with them. This was all news to me and the moment I moved in I told them not to tip toe around me if they had any issues and they could come to me and I would resolve any issues or annoying habits. My friend even came to me about one small issue that annoyed her, I didn't have a place to put my toothbrush so I left it out on the sink in the corner and always rinsed. As soon as she brought this up, I told her I would fix it and I was happy in my demenour and made sure she knew I wasn't upset. I immediately resolved that issue by putting it in my cosmetic bag. I thought that me showing her I would be approachable on the small matters, would show her she could come to me about any other issues.\n\nI felt very hurt as I done so much during my stay than I ever would have for any other flat mate. Her friends would even come over and she would run late often so I happily entertained them and make them coffee, drinks and food. I didn't mind but when I was attacked by my other friend for how difficult they found it living with me, I was completely shocked. \n\nI would buy her presents and special cleaning products for her home after she came to me for advice. She had hired a cleaner but her cleaner said there was no point coming to clean now I moved in as it was spotless and instead she would have a cup of tea with me and a chat. I noticed her cleaner would do extra things for her and she never really said thanks.\n\nI am so grateful for her taking me in. I truly am but I am hurt that she couldn't come to me and I was made to feel like the bad person by another friend of mine. I even said you have not even asked me, my side of things but it made no difference, there mind was made up.\n\nWhat would you do?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

(Strictly platonic, I\u2019ve had enough uncomfortable experiences with dudes flirting with me and I\u2019m not interested in any sort of relationship right now.) \n\nA little about myself:\n- Not a big gamer. Fun fact: I\u2019ve never played Minecraft which a friend of mine thinks is absolutely hilarious!! I do play Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley though.\n- Love music, I go through phases where I just listen to one song on repeat for days. Right now it\u2019s Fiona Apple\u2019s cover of across the universe. I mainly listen to indie/alt music. Always open to recs though! I\u2019m seeing Liam Gallagher in concert soon and I\u2019m so excited. \n- As for tv shows I watched Barry lately and I loved it! Other faves of mine include: Undone, Killing Eve, Fleabag, It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, On my Block, Friday Night Dinner, The Good Place and One Day At a Time.\n- I like politics, I\u2019m left-wing. I\u2019m also hella bisexual\n\nI think that\u2019s it really. I know I have a lot going on but I also like listening to people as well.

A little background- my best friend and this guy met last week online. They're both in their early twenties. They live like 15 hours away from each other so they've obviously never met. They've done some typical xxx stuff over Facetime which isn't my business but she told me. I'm not judging her because back during the Omegle days I was wild. ANYWAYS.\nHe won't add her on Facebook or accept her instagram follow request. He says it's because he doesn't use them that often but you can see he's added pictures to his instagram because it was 80 posts the other day and now it's 82. So he obviously uses it. He also follows over 4000 accounts on instagram. I care very much about my friend and I have a fuckboy for a brother so I know how they roll. So I did some investigating. I found his Twitter, not too hard since he uses his first and last name as a user name. He follows over 200 accounts...of just porn and girls who just want to sext. It was really disturbing because there were several who had in their bios that they mentioned they were 15 and for people 18+ don't follow. He's 22. That's just wrong. \n\nMy friend had an awful day the other day where she said she felt like she was alone and just wanted to cry herself to sleep. He refused to Facetime her since he was busy with homework but managed to send her a selfie in the shower. It's obvious to me he doesn't care about her and only sees that she's good for one thing.\n\nShould I keep that I know that her boyfriend follows over 200 accounts on Twitter that's nothing but porn and smutty things, some of which are under age? He's just going to hurt her. But I don't want to break her heart myself and have her be upset with me. I know it's really not my business but I care about my friend.

Please don\u2019t hold it against me because it\u2019s not something I\u2019m in control of.  I would also like to note that my grammar isn\u2019t perfect and English is my first language so come at me all you want.\n\nHi there! I would tell you my real name but I have to keep it private for security reasons however if you do decide to message me you can call me Elliott. You can probably tell by the sub I\u2019m posting this on that I\u2019m looking for a friend. Why? Why would a most likely beautiful teenage girl decide to scour the internet for a friend instead of trying to find one in the real world? One that she can talk to in person and actually go places with? Well, it\u2019s not that simple. Yes, I have friends. Yes, I hang out with them. But they don\u2019t get me as much as I want them to. Now you might be thinking \u201dDramatic much? I\u2019m sure your friends understand you very well.\u201d  Well, think about it this way: \n\nYou are a really attractive person (so you are told). You have friends, clubs, good grades; everything. Life was super fair. Or at least, that\u2019s what everyone else thought. Now imagine, your parents divorced when you were 5, the memory of you trying to hold back your tears as you hid around the corner and peered in to listen to their conversation still embedded in your mind. Now, Imagine seriously liking this girl, then finding out she\u2019s straight. Imagine asking her out to see if you even had a shot and getting a no followed by tons of people asking you about it and watch them silently mock you. Imagine being diagnosed with a mental disorder and deciding to open up to your friends just to have them laugh at their own conversations and not even bat an eye at you. Imagine the next day your friend comes running in with a big problem and everyone sits there and listens to her while just standing there thinking \u2019Do they really feel that way about me?\u2019   Because yeah, that\u2019s only half of how my life is \u2019amazing\u2019.\n\nSo, now I\u2019m here. I\u2019m looking for a friend to help me escape it all. I don\u2019t want someone to talk to, someone to reach out to or even someone to get me help. All I want is someone to help me forget. I want someone to talk to about silly things like how I have a dog who likes to play hide and seek with me. I want to be able to just chill and not feel pressured to do anything in the real world. So yeah. I\u2019m surprised you made it this far, but thank you for listening to my long rant nonetheless. Anyways, my inbox is open!\n\nTLDR: Rough childhood.  Still Rough. Need a friend to help me escape it all. Not looking for a therapist.\n\nEdit: Thanks so much for all of the support! I wasn\u2019t expecting to have so many people see this and reply to it. This was supposed to be a stupid rant that would have probably been seen by about 2 people but the number of kind people I  met was slightly overwhelming. Once again, thanks so much and enjoy the rest of your day or night!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

It all happened in a way that I never wanted.\n\nI will try to be brief. We will call her by the imaginary name of Britany, and her ex-boyfriend, who was also my friend and former partner, we will call him Andy.\n\nSome time ago I was going through a great crisis, which I dragged from the age of 15, was a simple child who was thrown out of school I was going to have disapproved of the year, leaving me adrift, away from my classmates, and without the possibility of A second chance to improve as a student. (And no, I am not trying to victimize myself, but I was really having a hard time, my parents were going through a separation, and the school saw my bad school performance so they sent me to a psychopedagogue who sent me a diagnosis which said that I was very attached to my friends and that I also had attention problems, and that mattered little to the school, who shit on my feelings).\n\nBut hey, back to the subject. Nor did my friends from before understand what I was going through, and I also had some error as a person (I failed them on occasion, I recognize it).\n\nThere came a time of the year 2018-19, which were in the last year of high school, were graduates and were going to make the trip of graduates. And I, simply here, drifting, living from suffering for not being able to be a part, and without them being able to know about my pain, while each time I noticed that they were moving further away.\n\nSometimes I saw them, and tried to talk to them, to get back together as we used to do, that we organized in some house to eat, or to go out to a club or night party.\n\nI was friends with Britany for the entire time I was sharing a high school course, and beyond that, we went out until two years ago (even when I was dating Andy) to have beers out there, smoke, and have fun like two friends.\n\nIt turns out that some time later, for some reason, she got mad at me (it seems she got jealous because I uploaded a photo with an instagram\n\nher friend with whom I was fighting) and I remember one night from her mouth to say that she didn't want to be friends with fake people.\n\nWell, I let time pass, and it happened. One night, in a nightclub, she greeted me, I greeted her and I remember consulting her for her anger, which I think she didn't remember.\n\nWe had something, we smoked some cigarettes, and we talked for a while. There, I also found Andy and greeted him, I told him that I had to talk to him later, and when I found him again later, I told him that I longed to join him and we should have a drink and play videogames some day.\n\nWell, the next day, I wrote a message to that friend to organize, a message he never saw, then later I wrote another one that didn't interest him either. I started to consider that he was angry with me.\n\nTime passed and I didn't see her anymore. In the meantime, I think she was still offended, I don't remember precisely why, or if the photo I uploaded to instagram was after that night I saw her.\n\nOne of those nights, I dreamed about her, and I missed her so much that I was awake to wake up and write a message to whatsapp, which never came because I had broken the phone.\n\nThen, I think that this weekend, walking around a nightclub, I saw her after a long time, she looked at me, I looked at her, and I gave her a hug that really was very restorative, I told her how much I missed her and longed for the old time. I told him to join us for a beer and walk in the park as we did before.\n\nWe did it, we fixed it, and I went to look for it one afternoon, I accompanied her to find out some things she needed to know near the square, we went to the supermarket to buy to drink, and we sat in the square.\n\nSpeaking a bit of everything, I bring up the subject of her ex-boyfriend (Andy), I tell him that he seemed offended with me and, quickly, she replies that he was angry because supposedly \"she was filling her friends with lies with things of the\". Well, he also told me that after being with me drinking beers, he would meet a friend of his ex-boyfriend that he liked.\n\nWell, some days later, I went to a nightclub. And, over there, while I was having a drink, I feel my friend Andy calling me from behind, I turn in surprise, I greet him and say \"hey, I thought you were mad at me\" and I told him what Britany said (only the first thing , about what he was going to meet with a friend of him, no). And he said no, that nothing to do, and that with his ex-girlfriend everything was fine. So, I kept calm, talked a little more and went for a walk.\n\nI went to a bar to ask for a drink, and over there, she comes to greet me, which I greet her well, and I told her that I had seen Andy and that he had told her what she told me and that he had said No, everything was great with her. Immediately, she was offended and angry.\n\nI tried to approach her all night to explain everything well, but she didn't want to listen to me. I assumed I was a little drunk, so I assumed that maybe it was temporary anger and I shouldn't take it so seriously.\n\nThe next day, it was a great day, I go to Instagram and invite her to walk and drink wine, her response was something like \"with you I do not go to the corner\", followed by that, and trying to remedy her anger (but it seems that I made it worse) I replied \"you do your head\" (if you do not understand this expression, it is something like worrying too much about something that does not make much sense to worry), followed by that, I block Instagram and decided not to insist more .\n\nSome nights, let's say 4 or 5, I've crossed it in the nightclub and try not to cross looks, and if I cross it I don't say hello, because at first I think it's not my fault, I just wanted to be fine with everyone, but I don't think she can apologize either, because she seems proud. But really, this is contrary to logic, because I would like to reconcile with it.\n\nI hope you can help me. The situation is hurting a lot and I'm dreaming of her very often and miss some moments with her. I think there is too much to walk and I would not like to distance myself from it.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

She always talks about I have a tiny waist, how I have a good group of friends, how I never have a shortage of guys - despite most of them being jerks. Usually I just overlook it. She has also said how she doesn't deserve me like twice. Is that also a red flag? And I also find myself mainly initiating plans. Should I just keep distance? We've been friends for a year.\n\nLike even last week, she was going thru a breakup. Sent money and gave advice..just to found thru Insta she was hanging with this same guy yesterday...and couldn't tell me.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

She made a huge impact in my life, she helped me figure out my sexuality, she was my first girlfriend (for like a week lmao), she introduced me to a lot of things. Idk how to word it but she was a really good friend of mine. However, in freshman year of hs, I decided to be a dick and drop her completely for no reason. She messaged me a few weeks into me ignoring her and asked if I was angry at her. I said yes and that I didn't want to be friends anymore. The friendship ended there. In reality, I was ashamed. Living in a homophobic household, I was dealing with a lot of internalized hate for myself. She was a constant reminder that I wasn't what my parents expected (straight.) Moreover, she wasn't the studious type, and I was under extreme pressure from my parents to make all A's and go to a prestigious college. I dropped her because I felt she would distract me from that. Those reasons are absolute bullshit, I know, but I'm stuck now. It's been a year or two and she's friends with some of my friends, and it gets awkward when she comes to talk to them or they bring her up. Our mutual friends know we're not really talking. Today actually one of them brought up that in a random discord with all of them (not me) in it, she asked if I was in the group and said she didn't want to be in the discord if I was there. I've regretted this ever since I broke it off with her, but this makes me feel particularly bad. I know I deserve this, she should be angry with me, but I feel like such a disgusting person right now. I dropped her and made her feel bad because I couldn't handle my own internalized homophobia. I want to apologize, but I feel like it's too late. I don't mind if we aren't friends anymore, I just want to clear stuff up and express that I'm sorry. I'm not sure if I should though. Should I try to apologize to her or should I accept the friendship is over? It's been a year since I ended it, and I'm not sure if she even cares anymore. She avoids my eye contact in the hallway and it makes me feel bad. I feel like a shitty person right now. \nShould I apologize? And how?

For the past 3 years I've noticed that they would exclude me from things. They would hang out without me on social media, they created a seperate group chat without me, and one girl in particular would always make a point of giving me dirty looks or talking whenever we would hang out. The one girl I just mentioned I was the closest to in the group and I considered her one of my best friends. However, over the past few years I noticed whenever I'd tell her about a new job I got or getting accepted into grad school, she would pretend to be happy and then she'd have a look on her face where it seemed like she was not happy for me. In the summer I asked if she wanted to meet up to go for drinks and she agreed, but the night of she cancelled on me at the last minute and came up with an excuse about how she's working on an \"assignment\", which was BS considering she was about to graduate from university in 3 weeks so it would have been impossible she was working on an assignment because her marks would have been in. \n\nThe last time I saw them as a group was in april, and I felt excluded. They made it a point to talk about inside jokes right in front of me and I felt left out and out the loop. I had to leave a bit early, and they hesitated to hug me. A couple of hours later I see they post a picture of them together without me in it...after I left.\n\nI guess the cherry on top was that one of the girls had a birthday party and I wasn't invited and I saw the pictures on social media. Only one them have reached out to me since the summer wishing me luck in grad school and apologizing while the other 2 have not said a word or reached out. With the one girl I was close to, I posted about how excited I was to get into grad school and then she blocked me on instagram. According to one of my friends who I asked (because I was in disbelief I was blocked) she posted an instagram story about how happy she was to be a new grad student at ___ university. I was not only hurt she blocked me but the fact that she lied to me because a couple of months I asked her if she was interested in applying to grad school. It made me wonder if after all the years of friendship and all the good memories she decided to destroy the friendship due to jealousy. \n\nI know all this sounds petty because we're 22, but how do I get over feeling hurt and angry? It's eating me up inside and I just want to let it go. I have other friends but it's hard to think of the fact that I never really mattered to people Ive known for half.of my life\n\nTl;dr", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I had to move back to Denmark after living in Finland with my ex of over five years. We broke up a little over a month ago, and it has been the heaviest thing I've had to deal with, but I am doing my best. She told me it was because of her mental issues getting worse, and I couldn't help here, no matter what I tried. Unfortunately, I had to leave a lot behind, a world I had grown used to.  \n\n\nI've returned feeling rather alone, actually. I've not had many good friends, and the few I do have, have not really been available right now.\n\nIf it's of any importance, I was diagnosed for depression, but I try not to let it get to me. If anything, it came as a surprise to me, as I thought and felt the way I do for as long as I can remember. It's harder now, obviously, but not too different from past life experiences.\n\nI'm a bit of an introvert, at least in a sense that I struggle mostly in meeting new people, compared to being open and chatty with them. I have difficulty just reaching out, like I am now. But not doing that doesn't really lead anywhere, so I am trying.\n\nI am right now playing Divinity Original Sin 2, by sharing it off a friend of mine's account. Cash it a bit tight from moving back, so I'm not really buying any new games right now. Instead I am playing what I already have, what is being shared, or some freebies, like Warframe. Could talk at length about that if that's your interest as well, but I pretty much only play on PC, it's what I have.\n\nI read comics, books (reading the first Wheel of Time now as it was suggested to me), draw once in a while as well. Used to also work with 3d modeling, something I have been meaning to get back into. I love playing tabletop games, like Dungeons and Dragons. Used to DM for a group in Finland, but now I am searching for a new one. Maybe I'll run one again online if I can't find anything.\n\nSo hey, if any of you want to maybe talk a bit, hit me with a message.

I went to their weddings, I was there for the birth of their first child, etc.\u00a0 Our children knew each other since they were babies and they grew up together celebrating holidays together.  Even though we didn\u2019t live close by, we met at least a few times a year, if not more often. I thought we were pretty close friends.\n\nWith the friend that I was closest to, we even went on family vacations together. That friend was my best friend **(bf)**.\n\nEverything was great up until about 2 years ago when I went through what I call the worst time of my life. This lasted for a few months. I was severely depressed and going through hell (divorce). Since I knew these friends pretty well, I shared almost everything with these friends. I thought they were my closest friends. At that time, they knew I was really sad and not doing well. I would often cry and pretty much be bad company because I was so sad. I still thought they were my true friends and would stick by me, as close true friends should do.\u00a0 I know that I would 100% be there for any of them, if they were going through any similar issues.\u00a0\n\nInstead my closest friend, the bf, distanced herself from me.\u00a0 She would rarely message me or ask me to come out anymore.  I reached out to her specifically stating that I needed a friend to be there for me. I\u2019m the kind of person that needs someone to talk to, when I feel like shit.\u00a0 I guess if I made any mistakes, it was that I trusted these \u201cclose\u201d friends would be by my side, even though I was a Debbie Downer for those few times we met during those few months. This was maybe a handful of times.\u00a0\n\nSo long story short, they started hanging out without me. I was no longer invited in their group chats, dinners or GNO\u2019s.\u00a0 The bf even started hanging out with a different group of girlfriends that I introduced her to, without inviting me. When I asked her about it, she said she was \u201cjust having fun, I would be invited soon\u201d. Needless to say, I felt even worse.\u00a0 I was so depressed and then to have my closest bf to desert me in my greatest time of need, was too much for me to handle. I was devastated.\u00a0\n\nGood thing, I still had another real friend, that was still there for me. She stuck by me in my worst days and is still here for me, as I will always be for her.\n\nSo now, two years later, I am doing much better and no longer depressed. I have worked through the issues and I am happy and living the rest of my life as best as I can.\u00a0 However, I am still extremely sad over the loss of those friendships, (especially the bf) and cannot get it out of my mind. Over the last year, I thought about my bf and the others almost everyday. I just couldn\u2019t believe that she left and we weren\u2019t friends anymore. Last year, I messaged that bf a few times and asked her to meet, but she ignored my messages.\n\nAnother gf from the group did message me once, but not really to meet or anything meaningful.\u00a0\n\nI celebrated my 50th birthday recently and not one of them even wished me a happy birthday.\u00a0 Not that this is very significant, but I don\u2019t think they ever remembered my birthday in the all years we\u2019ve been friends. I\u2019ve always remembered each of their birthdays and would message them yearly. I\u2019m wondering if they ever were my true friends, or was I just a fun, GNO drinking buddy before my life crisis?\u00a0 The kind of person you only want to go out with for fun times, but not when the going gets tough.\n\nI\u2019ve thought long and hard, what I did wrong.\u00a0 The only things that I can think of are that I was a Debbie Downer and I was too sensitive and expressive during those months I was severely depressed. But I only met them a handful of times during this period.\u00a0 Can\u2019t TRUE FRIENDS stay by your side for a few months of life crisis when we\u2019ve been friends for over 25 years?  I also regret telling them how sad I was when they went out without me and posted it on social media.\n\nThe last time we met (more than a year ago), I did ask that bf, why she stopped contacting me for months, she said she thought I needed time to be alone and reflect.\u00a0 I told her I needed a friend to talk to, not be alone in misery crying all day by myself. How is it possible for grown women to be so heartless?\n\nI know I have forgiven them, as I would still meet them if one of them were to call me today.\u00a0 But sadly, this has not happened and I know will not happen.\u00a0\n\nHow do I move on without thinking about them all the time?\u00a0 We had 25+ years of memories. That\u2019s longer than most of the friendships that I am reading about.\n\nHow do I put these friends in the past and move on and get over this heartaching sadness?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to meet new friends at this age. The new friends that I do meet now are so new, that\u2019s its hard to share things with them, especially about the pain I suffered.\n\nI know it\u2019s about quality, not quantity of friends. But the couple of friends that I have left don\u2019t  live nearby.\u00a0\n\nFriends\u00a0(quote I read somewhere)\n\nF- Fight for you\n\nR Respect you\n\nI Include you\n\nE Encourage you\n\nN Need you\n\nD Deserve you\n\nS Stand by you!", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I feel like she only invites us to hang out when it is convenient for her and she went to Vegas and partied with all those girls and won't even come out with us\". And then texted the group chat she couldn't come because she had other plans. First of all, I went to Vegas for a friend's wedding party. Second, I haven't gone out ALL SUMMER or for the past 6 months except Vegas. I work full time and am in school part time. In addition, she talks shit about our other mutual friend all the time and other friends of hers. Part of me wants to reach out and stand up for myself and the other part says maybe it is time to let her go. In the past 2 years of friendship she has never once asked me to hang out. That is always on me to facilitate places and when I do, I am blamed for not making convenient times for her. She talks shit about me and other friends. She has never communicated once that she has a problem with me. I messaged her today and asked her if she wanted to get dinner sometime this week and she can pick the time. No response. I feel there is nothing I can do right with her. I am not going to confront her on the shit talking because I don't think it is worth it. Sucks being curved like this. I believe all relationships are a 2 way street. Nothing is ever just one person's fault. However, I feel she has been really unfair to me, has not communicated to me or even given me a chance. Is it time to just give up trying?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I've received a considerable amount of messages, only to realize people don't even read what I wrote. They even ask for my name, or where I'm from, and that really disappoints me. I'm looking for someone who is genuinely interested in me, and not someone who sends the same copy pasted message to everyone.

I'm sorry if this comes out as rude, but I'm not here for that. :(\n\nThat being said:\n\nI enjoy a variety of things, such as History, Politics, baking, museums, exploring new places in my city, reading and writing.\n\nI like to read mainly historical and horror/mystery books, my favorite writers are Jane Austen, Edgar Allan Poe, Stephen King and HP Lovecraft. I also enjoy poetry a lot.\n\nI studied International Relations at college so I'm passionate about all the stuff concerning international affairs such as politics, trade, conflicts, etc. I work in the Communications area for a mobile transportation company but my dream is to one day have a bakery of my own!\n\nI studied Russian but I don't practice it a lot... So if you're from Russia you're also very much welcome to write me :D\nI can also help you with your Spanish or English if you need some help like me.\n\nIf you're still interested, we can talk over here, email or Kik.

It seems that there was quite a bit of anger towards me for many years that wasn't expressed. However, all of this only came to light AFTER I spent a lot of time and money to be a bridesmaid in her wedding. \n\nI really, really, really did try to end the friendship in the best possible way and even left a door open for future contact if she ever wanted. I just feel like all of my words got thrown back in my face. My last message to her was telling her how much I loved her and her family but that our friendship needed a break and to contact me in the future if she wanted to. This offended her quite a lot because she told me she didn't care - although I think she only said this to try and hurt me in retaliation of me very bluntly ending the friendship. \n\nAnyway, I think it's clear that the conversation was really hairy and our friendship definitely needed a break.  My question is; what are some coping skills that can help me through this right now? I understand time will help, but this honestly feels like a breakup. I'm hurt, angry, and can't stop thinking about how awful the conversation went. I'm not about to contact her anytime soon, I am very serious about ending the friendship and felt I really did the best I could to end things well.  I have a very hard time making friends (social anxiety) and only have two - now one true friend. So losing friends makes a huge impact on my life. I'm really struggling with this. \n\nTLDR I ended a really long friendship and I'm having a hard time coping with the loss.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Just want to feel like someone cares. This is my throwaway account cause I\u2019m a mod on a pretty big sub on my other account I just fuck around on here so disregard my post history. I\u2019m 19 m in college, It\u2019s a small college and I commute so I don\u2019t really know anyone, all my friends and my girlfriend go to the state university in my state which I only have a couple friends anyways and only one of them I\u2019m actually close with. I\u2019m just alone 24/7 all day every day unless I go visit my girlfriend or friends occasionally but my girlfriend been treating me like shit lately and I\u2019ve seen her one weekend in the past month and a half. She just not making time for me all of a sudden and never compliments me or does anything for me anymore I just want to feel loved by her. I do so many random things for her like order her Starbucks or write her a sweet paragraph or buy her something thinking like oh if I do this she\u2019ll be more loving ya know and she is for like 5 minutes then it\u2019s just back to feeling like she doesn\u2019t even like me idk if anyone can relate but it\u2019s the worst feeling. \n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s cheating and she doesn\u2019t really party and we handled the distance perfectly fine last year just been treating me shitty the past couple months and it sucks cause she\u2019s the only person in my life I\u2019m really close with and have to talk to about shit but it\u2019s like I can\u2019t talk to her about feeling sad over her. I\u2019ve told her how I feel but she doesn\u2019t really seem to care, like she acts like she does but she doesn\u2019t treat me any better. She just gaslights me all the time and I don\u2019t want to leave her but she\u2019s been making me feel so worthless and shit idk. \n\nI have abusive parents who kicked me out last summer and let me back in this summer but they just belittle me and bully me and beat me down every single day I try to avoid them at all costs. It just really sucks like the one person in my life I love the most and do so much for and actually have there for me is treating me like absolute shit and not been there for me. Then the only other people I really interact with everyday is my parents who are supposed to love me and bring me up and help me in life but nah they just scream at me and call me names and beat me down making me feel like shit everyday. That leaves me just alone in my head 24/7 feeling small and beat down and insecure and depressed with no one giving me kind words or any positive support whatsoever while I give all that to everybody and do all this shit to try to please the people in my life and whatever I think will make them show me some love and support. Like I was saying I\u2019ll buy my gf things and write her nice texts and whatever hoping she\u2019ll do the same for me just anything like if she calls me cute once it makes my whole week like I don\u2019t stop thinking about it. I can\u2019t remember the last time she surprised me with a gift or just wrote out something saying she appreciates me and whatever. \n\nIdk if this sounds petty there\u2019s a lot I didn\u2019t touch on I don\u2019t feel like typing anymore I\u2019m just miserable rn.

It might seem like I\u2019m expecting too much from people but I\u2019m not like I have so much fucking shit beating me down and I\u2019m still able to show people my love and support for them there\u2019s no excuse they can\u2019t do even a fraction of the same for me.

I\u2019ve considered her of my closest friends for about 5 years or so.  Despite living not to far away Mary and I don\u2019t meet IRL as much as I\u2019d like but over time I\u2019d adapted to this and really look forward to our coffee dates or other meet ups.  I believe Mary has social anxiety so I\u2019ve been quite patient with her over the years.  We would be in good enough contact via text as she isn\u2019t much of social media person.  Sometimes we\u2019d text forever and other times there\u2019s a big gap. Sometimes Mary doesn\u2019t reply to texts, funny links/videos etc for days (sometimes a week or two) and you know life if busy, it happens, give her time and she comes back when she\u2019s ready right? \n\nExcept a lot of the time she doesn\u2019t, often I have to re-initiate contact.  I have to be the one to suggest coffee dates and meet ups.  I have to be the one to understand when Mary doesn\u2019t respond or reply to a meetup suggestion she doesn\u2019t want to do it - doesn\u2019t matter what it is, no response means \u201cno\u201d. On the flip-side if she wants to do something she\u2019ll reply immediately and sometimes cut the arrangement plans short - again that date doesn\u2019t happen.  There are a few times it works out with no hitches but most times happen like the above.  Sometime she was complain that I want to arrange plans too quickly (ie. in the case of something that will sell out fast like a concert tickets).  I find this quite draining to constant be the \u201cSuggester\u201d and keep the line of communication open.\n\nOn it\u2019s own I put this down to she\u2019s just busy and give her some space.  Only to later learn she has no problem texting my partner in these times whom she is also good friends with.  I have mentioned this to both of them and how this just makes me feel left out and they just shrug it off.  My partner at one point even mentioned \u201cit\u2019s not my fault she finds me easier to talk to\u201d.  I am also in a group chat with the two of them and it\u2019s mostly just them talking about something I have no clue about, when I send a message the conversation usually just fizzles out shortly afterwards.\n\nI have made a lot of efforts myself to change how I approach texts and Mary (I\u2019m a more IRL person than an online person).  I\u2019ve invited her on small friend group holidays to try and build up those friendship bonds, but these always end badly.  It\u2019s always the same: she will ignore all the group planning and plan her own bits independently. She will have an issue during the trip she didn\u2019t communicate with anyone in advance, clam up about it, lash out in some form (usually at me) and then get really upset that no one is helping/interacting with her.  After the trip she will eventually state what the issue was but not before she\u2019s caused a lot of unnecessary grief and drama.  Yet she will always state the issue was down to ME not communicating effectively. \n\nI have ended this friendship over these things before.  Mary had fixed some of the issues but they keep happening. If it wasn\u2019t for my partner, I wouldn\u2019t have worked so hard on this friendship because when times are good they are good.  Alas there is a constant cycle of me feeling ignored in favour of my partner, which really erodes away at my self-being. I feel I should just cut Mary from my life as I\u2019m clearly just a option to her and she just isn\u2019t working on her side of the friendship.  I feel like I\u2019m the only one making any really effort and that the relationship is one-sided.\n\nTLDR; Close friend ignores my texts, happily texts my partner, constantly blames me for communication breakdown.

My friends have been mostly playing games that I don't, which I'm perfectly happy about, but as I don't really have other friends, I feel like a bit of a third wheel a lot. \n\n\nI play on PC exclusively (my consoles are are older, like Wii, GameCube, PS2), I like games like Dead by Daylight, League of Legends, Stardew Valley, 7 Days to Die, The Forest, some singleplayer games, all that good stuff. I also got Killer Queen Black through Discord but have yet to try it. I don't care what your skill level I anything is.\n\n\nAs for other hobbies, I'm very much into true crime, paranormal things, reading, music, art, conspiracies (there aren't many I personally subscribe to, I just think they're interesting), history, honestly I can talk about almost any topic. I can get in to any genre of music (YES, even country). I like tea but not when it involves me, so I settle for YouTube drama. If you have any spooky experiences I'd love to hear those! I'm big in to deep talks about life and all that jazz. I have a dark sense of humor, however, if that isn't your cup, I'm more than happy to accommodate and change it up.\n\n\nI'd prefer people around my age or older, with at least gaming in common.

I told him I can\u2019t be sure I\u2019ll be available (been busy with work and college. ) Anyway, I\u2019m not sure if the party even existed. He gave me a general location and not an address. I told him about my other plans then like 4 hours later he bailed despite the fact that he seemed interested and said he didn\u2019t feel like going out that night. We\u2019ve hung out before but he bailed the last time we were suppose to hang out too. He was suppose to help me unload stuff from my car since I had just moved buuut maybe he didn\u2019t wanna do that or thought the stuff was heavy or felt like he was just getting used. He\u2019s never bailed like that before. I did get pretty angry at him this one time but we worked it out. The next time we hung out after that he did seem kind of nervous and probably knows he wasn\u2019t being nice. Oh and I think he might  be bipolar or something. He\u2019s assaulted his dad many times and even broke into his place and stole. His dad has a restraining order on him then let him in when he had no place to go due to homelessness. What\u2019s your opinion on this ? Is he plotting to hurt me? I do know he seemed interested in sex so it\u2019s also possible he\u2019s secretly with someone. But yeah. What\u2019s up with this?

He\u2019s been my longest friend and was the best man in my wedding. In our 20s, we enjoyed going to bars, concerts, smoking pot, some video games, watching sports etc \u2013 normal guy stuff.\n\nI finished college, got married, have a career and 3 kids (another one on the way). We would text/talk off/on as guys do. \n\nA few years ago Jeff moved to Portland, ME. Over the summer, he invited me come visit. He raved about all there was to do there \u2013 hiking, downtown, eating seafood/lobster, music, etc. Sounded like a good lil weekend trip (I also enjoy the foliage).\n\nNow, I have a pretty busy life. But I needed a break and managed to get away but it wasn\u2019t easy. I really went out of my way.\n\nI was looking forward to this trip a LOT. And when I finally got there, Jeff couldn\u2019t seem to care less. I had to Uber to his house because he said he was getting over migraine and couldn't pick me up from the bus station. When I arrived at noon, he was still in his pajamas sleeping on the couch.\n\nI subsequently learned that he\u2019d recently lost his job and had no car (and I think the place he was staying was technically his gf\u2019s). Anyway, I tried to be a good guest and a good friend. He wasn\u2019t feeling well, so I said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you a few hours and explore on my own.\u201d I walked around town on my own, had a few drinks at bars and sorta explored the area (which was tough to do on my own but I managed with Google).\n\nEvery 2-3 hours, I\u2019d check in but he always needed more time to feel better.  He refuused to talk about anything of substance and didn't even look me in the eye. He eventually came out for a drink when we had to pickup his girlfriend. But he sat in the corner drinking and smoking cigarettes. I was very awkward for me. Any attempts to talk with him were one-sided. I\u2019d get yes or no answers, etc. I tried to ask his girlfriend what as going on and she just sighed and said, \u201cHe gets like this. He shoulda told you.\u201d\n\nWe went to a good seafood place (actually he refused to order anything, just drank and spent most of the time coming in and outside to smoke). Quietly, I told him that if he was tight on $, I had money and would pick up the tabs for the weekend (which I did). \n\nThe evening was spent sitting on his couch watching Netflix.  He ignored all the plans we had previously made. He didn\u2019t care that I had gone to great length to spend time with him. In fact, he seemed annoyed I was there.\n\nI wasn\u2019t gonna waste another day counting on him to get it together. I booked a plane ticket and left early despite it costing me an additional $300. I couldn\u2019t stand it be there another moment. He actually seemed happy for me to leave.\n\nI am done with this person but still very troubled by how I was treated. He was pretty much negative on anything I did. I'm both hurt and angry at myself for being put in this situation. As much as I consider my relationship with this person over, I sorta wonder if I should say something more or just move on.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I still believe in such a person. \n\nHowever, it seems the only other people who follow a similar-model to myself are those who do so due to religious-practice (I'm agnostic), those who have issues with intimacy (been to therapists; they say that isn't the case) or those simply haven't had the opportunity to get intimate with another (I've had offers). \n\nI'm here to see if there is some sort of community for people like me, or others who might feel the same way I do (i.e. reserving physical intimacy due to non-religious values). \n\nNot really here to get into a debate; just trying to find other people like myself.

I'm a reddit lurker, I usually read tons of posts, but have made only about one (incidentally about another friend as well)\nI'm a regular old Bangalorean kid studying in the UK. I'm in a pretty good uni down in the south of England and I'm new here. I recently made friends with a person from the same country as I'm from, who is very sheltered, hates their family (they have good reason to) and is (self-admittedly) bad at keeping friends. We didn't really have problems as I helped them out with things like cooking, letting them stay over one night when they were sad etc. \n\nIt is autumn in England and pretty rainy. You most certainly need an umbrella at all times as it can rain even when the sun's out. This person claims to have broken their umbrella as soon as they arrived, but refuses to buy another one because they \"only want those humongous ones that can double as walking sticks\" but are unwilling to pay the price (those umbrellas cost at least \u00a310 plus). I tried to reason with them that that is not the reason they can't buy an umbrella, as they are sure to get their books and laptop wet, but they won't listen. We always share an umbrella and it's become a nuisance to me because I'm tired of constantly sharing and getting half-wet. Last Sunday, we came back from an overnight stay at a friend's and I happened to leave my umbrella with her. Our conversation on instagram went as follows\nM - Me\nF - Them\n\nM: Bro what time do you want to leave?\n(the consensus the previous night was that6we would go to class together)\n\nF : Hmph\nF : You still wanna leave w/ me?\nF :  Can we do a. 9 :30?\n\nM : (understanding that she probably wanted to be left alone)\n     I'll be mostly off on my own once we reach the forum\n\nF: Huh\n\nM: Yeah, I'm tryna figure out some stuff on my own so I'll still be around if you want to talk/ask anything \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\n\nF : Um okay\n\nF : I'll be a little late, so I'll leave around 45 or sumn you can leave if you want\n\n(I had stuff to do, it was raining outside, so I thought I'd just take my umbrella and leave)\n\nM : Can I come up for my umbrella?\n\nF then  tells me to come after a while because they were going to take a shower. I wait, then go over. They open the door and then motion me to come into the room. I was just there for my umbrella, so I took it and left. It was raining pretty hard that day, so I wondered how they'd make it to class. They didn't come, and today I found out they blocked me on Instagram? I'm just really confused, and I know they're not going to talk at all so I don't really know what to do.\n\nI'm on my phone, so soz for any formatting errors.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Should I stay or should I go?\n\n\nTitle sounds worse than it is, but hear me out. I\u2019ve (23f) had this friend (22f) for a couple years now and we started pretty strong but hit some bumps not long after we really got close. \n\n\nFirst, I\u2019d like to explain that I have a history of poor friendships. As people can be cruel or untrustworthy, I limit my circle to a few select individuals. It\u2019s hard enough for me to trust anyone and when I do, I work hard to ensure that it is a mutually beneficial relationship. However, this also means I don\u2019t put up with a lot of shit and very rarely do I \u201cfight\u201d with my close friends, because we lay everything on the table without confrontation. \n\n\nAnyway, she showed her true colors at one point during a drama-filled evening and said some really mean things completely out of context. Like, I truly wasn\u2019t involved in what she was \u201cupset\u201d about, but was just standing there and needed to be yelled at, I guess. We didn\u2019t talk for awhile but eventually reconnected and \u2018talked\u2019 it out, though she never really owned up to what she said and how hurtful it was, just kinda brushed me off. I figured it wasn\u2019t really that big of a deal and let it go. Things were a bit strained but better for awhile. \n\n\nFast forward to last spring, she graduated and moved across the country. We stayed in touch and over the summer I went to visit her for a week. \n\n\nThat week was filled with an endless stream of criticisms and yet another lashing out for something so trivial; it could\u2019ve been avoided by a simple conversation or request. In that lashing came more harsh words, and the theme throughout the remainder of the trip was that I was less than because I didn\u2019t think, act, or do, like her. \n\n\nWe come from two different worlds- she comes from *abundant wealth and is essentially neurotypical. I come from poverty and have struggled with a handful of mental health issues my whole life. \n\n\nWe knew we had our differences, but she was empathetic and kind about them when we first met. I don\u2019t know what changed, but what used to be well-meaning, accepted (and helpful!) advice, turned into cruel accusations and quite literally telling me I\u2019m stupid for things I do differently than her.\n\n\nI\u2019ve been avoiding her since the trip. Why would I want to talk to someone that clearly doesn\u2019t agree with the way I live my life? I don\u2019t want to call her and hear her disapproving tone when I try to talk about my trivial anxieties or other choices made from mental illness. \n\n\nShe is still trying to stay close, however, but I really don\u2019t understand why? She seemed genuinely frustrated with me during that week so I don\u2019t know what she would be getting out of a friendship either. \n\n\nI don\u2019t hate her by any means, and I obviously still care about her. I just really don\u2019t feel the need to maintain a friendship with someone that has been cruel to me multiple times and only seems to have negative things to say about me. \n\n\nI have no desire to surround myself with that energy, but I feel bad just ignoring her so I\u2019ve just been flakily avoiding her, or only responding to surface level things. \n\nAlso living a few thousand miles apart means we only really connect through social media, it will likely be years before we live near another again, if ever. Is it worth it? \n\n\nSo, reddit, am I missing something? Is is normal for friends to be harsh sometimes? If so, how does anyone deal with that? \n\n\nAny and all advice about this is appreciated:-)", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Me and my partner have just moved in with a friend. Before moving in they said they had something they wanted to talk about, but it could wait until we've moved in properly.  We've known this friend for a while, trust them a lot, have lived with them before and had no issues. \n\nThey told us last night that they have several people living in their body, and that they've invited them in, that it's essentially disassociative identity disorder but they've chosen to have it, that it helps them deal with their depression. They also switched into two different personalities that evening and \"introduced\" themselves to us, we had to introduce ourselves back. \n\nI've previously studied DID a bit and know it's very rare, and a personality disorder that is developed through childhood trauma, that it's not really something you \"choose\" to do. But if I am open minded for a minute, accept that that's the case and they have done for themselves, I'm kind of frustrated for a number of reasons. \n\n1.  I'm a very introverted person and takes me a long time to trust people because of past trauma. I'm very nervous around new people, it took me a long time to come around to the idea of moving in with someone else. Now I'm actually living with several people, and I only know one of them. \n2. They chose this several years ago, and didn't tell us until we've already moved in. \n\nThat's assuming it's a real situation. The other option is that it's all nonsense and they're having us on, but I don't feel like I can accuse them of this since if it IS real it'll be really shitty of me, and if it's bullshit its not like they're going to tell us. But there are little things that make me think it's BS. Things like the previous day they made a big deal about not liking a particular food, then when they switched they suddenly love that food. The \"original\" loves to cook, the first switch we met loudly proclaimed they can't cook. little things like that. \n\nIf it is genuinely DID, I want to accept it and adjust and deal with it and get to know my new housemates. I know how rare and how little studies there are on DID. But they've said all along they're choosing to do this and it raises a lot of red flags for me. Either way I feel angry, if it's true I'm angry they've essentially smuggled in several other housemates I wasn't aware I was going to be living with for the foreseeable future, if it's not true I'm angry they're playing me for a fool. \n\nAny advice welcome!!", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

First of all, I already apologize if there will be any mistakes, English is not my first language and I\u2019m still learning!\n\nA little something about me now I guess? I\u2019m more of a listener than a talker and more a background type of person. Like I\u2019m there but not conspicuous. I would say I\u2019m more of an introvert but currently I\u2019m trying to become more open, so here I am. Another thing, sometimes I\u2019m struggling with keeping a conversation up so it would be helpful if you could take over that part if it\u2019s ever needed!\n\nI spend most of my day with daydreaming or listening to music. (Twenty One Pilots, Panic! at the Disco, Halsey, The Neighbourhood, 80s &amp; 90s music and many more!) One of my passions is not only watching but also discussing several Movies, Books and TV Shows such as the MCU, Harry Potter, The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones and and and. Seriously, I can do it for hours without getting tired of it. I\u2019m also a huge fan of going to the cinema!\n\nI\u2019m also a creative person in any possible way. For example, I like editing photos and videos, I\u2019m not the best at it but I still like to draw here and there and I enjoy writing story\u2019s and letters. Huge plus if you would be open to exchange handwritten letters sometime in the future!\n\nAlright now if you made it through this mess, congrats! You don\u2019t need to suffer any longer.

I've met some awesome people through this site, but people fall off or get busy and I crave a lot of conversation in the background of my daily routine, so trying again now. I love chill, open-minded, curious people who like to learn about different subjects and find interesting links/things online and send them to each other to discuss. I'm online pretty often during the work week (EST time zone) and so can sustain real-time text convos if that's up your alley, or we can send each other longer messages like in penpalling. And if you're in Boston, I like checking out cafes/restaurants/art installations or just ambling about the city. (If you wanna try an urban exploration adventure together, all the better!)\n\nReading is my main hobby tbh; I devour classics, and am dedicated to ever expanding my understanding of the world around us and inside us through literature. I love Baudelaire, and Dostoevsky, and Swinburne (though I know he's not fashionable anymore in the English canon haha but aestheticism ftw). I enjoy games (mostly RPGs, or shorter artsy indie efforts) too though I usually suck at them. Can't wait for Pokemon Sword and Shield. With everything else (art history, philosophy, memes, films, TV) I'm just an occasional dabbler, just like to ooh and ahh at cool things. Thought *Joker* was pretty good. Looking forward to the next season of Rick and Morty.\n\nThese days I'm pretty chill, after having spent a lot of my life angsting over not having it together. I guess I'm contentedly, if not happily, lost now. Always open to talking about where we are in life, or physical and mental health and wellness/lifestyle/self-improvement things, and learning more about the deep parts of people, as a major focus in my life right now is to cultivate a growth mindset and become more comfortable with getting close to people in friendships and relationships. If you're into MBTI, I'm an INTP. Pottermore said I'm a Hufflepuff, but I self-identify as Ravenclaw lmao.

I find most things interesting and I don't mind reading long messages at all. You can vent. I also like venting.\n\nI'd like for us to check up on eachother daily. To sometimes say random things or ask random questions. I just want someone to chat with about anything really. Daily experiences. Common things. Usual or extremely unusual occurrences. To share fun facts and new shit we learn. To recommend various good songs, films, TV series, books and the list goes on... Random various stuff about whatever. Literally anything.\n\nOf course, I'm not expecting all that immediately. It will be a slow process of building our friendship. No rush at all. No pressure and no stress. We'll take our time and do it the way we want. That's all.\n\nBut yeah, a lot of things I could write here. If you are interested, just send me a message or something. We'll slowly find out things and information about eachother by chatting. That's way more interesting than writing everything about myself here.\n\nWe can start chatting here on Reddit, but  I would prefer for us to move on to messenger after some time if possible. I like keeping everything into one place. You will also be able to see how I look then. While I don't think that looks matter like at all in friendships, especially in online ones, I still think it's quite nice to at least know how the other person looks in real life. To see who you are texting with you know... It really helps deepen that connection. In my opinion.\n\nThough, I respect your privacy and won't really demand a photo of yourself or something like that. But I would truly appreciate it, if we will be going for a long-term friendship. Which is what I am going for.\n\nBut first, let's just get to know eachother, and put the photos/selfie matter aside from now. It's not really that important currently.\n\nAnd well, we'll see : )", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

It was super toxic, and I'm really dumb for falling for half of it. He's unfortunately still involved in my friend group, so there's a lot of instances where I have to be around him. Even though I've convinced myself that it would never work and that I had to move on he always sort of lingered around and really played with my feelings and insecurities. To this day if we're ever at a party or something he'll try to hook up with me and when I question it he'll pull the \"oh I'm so/was drunk I don't remember\" or just blame it on being \"blackout\". He even went as far to once tell me that he \"feels like he's the reason for a lot of my emotional pain\".   \n\n\nSo I've had a feeling that he and my really good friend have been sleeping together for a while now. Even one night at a party we were playing never have I ever and someone said: \"Never have I ever slept with \\*insert his name here\\*\". My friend (who I think is sleeping with him) and another one of my friends exchanged worried panicked looks and didn't drink - and that's when I first realized that it was for sure happening. Fast forward to this past week, my friend told me that it was for sure happening and that they've been secretly seeing each other for a few months now. \n\nNow here is where I'm having an issue; everyone knows but neither of them has bothered to try and tell me about it. I started seeing someone new and apparently they're waiting to tell me once it's \"official\" so I can't get mad. I feel like they're trying to play the victim here, but in the end, I feel like I'm the actual victim. This friend watched me cry over this guy, watched my heartbreak into a thousand pieces over this guy (not actually but ya feel). I've also given a few opportunities on each of their ends to tell me and they deny it each time. Even one of my friends who's known for a while even denied it when I asked her about it. I know that you can't really control who you catch feelings for. But how come everyone is \"protecting\" them from me know. If they want to be happy together then that's great, I just feel really betrayed by my girlfriend who hasn't bothered to talk to me about it and is hiding from me.

After the morning session, he ran out to clock into work which is as a mechanic at the same apartment complex he lives and start early , my sister returned only to leave to grab her kids a pizza lunch for school, after she had left and he popped in and put, I snuck into his bathroom and hit his water bong multiple times, only getting smoke off of a few hits, unfortunately this same day he was working right next door to his bathroom and ran back in to through their sliding glass window on his break, only to walk in on me with a very angry and disappointed look on his face asking \"what are you doing in here?\" I froze and said nothing as I was so terribly scared to answer. he put it all away, handed me my phone and to go out in the living room as he locked it from behind me. A few minutes of silence and anxiety runnning through my head as my euphoria wasn't at the apec of bliss as I thought it would be after hitting it again, before I collected my thoughts. I knocked on his door, walked in with his permission and stuck my hand and apologized for my wrong action to him like a man and he forgave me, we had an emotionally heart to heart and by the end of it, things felt better then when the incident first started, I gave him my word to never interact with the stuff unless we were together and he controlled it, this situation is also what has prompted me to get off the stuff for a few months as a personal change of pace and to give my body a rest from it, if anyone has any advice for any of this or has experienced something similar, comment on this or @ me, I'm interested to know if something like this has happened to anyone else?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

It may surprise you that it\u2019s not that long because for some reason I cant remember 80% of my life before 13, going down from there is just a blank. I\u2019m still trying to figure out the reason why. I have an extremely bad time when trying to figure out my own emotions, sometimes even wondering if I have them at all. Most of the time, when it\u2019s not a turmoil, it\u2019s apathy, emptiness.\n\nMy social life has been a downhill slope, starting with my family dysfunctional relationship ever since my parents divorced. I don\u2019t talk to them a lot, and usually don\u2019t want to, which just makes me hate myself even more. I once heard that if you don\u2019t have **a** relationship with your family, you won\u2019t have a relationship with anyone. And for my personal experience I would say that\u2019s true. I only have one friend that still chooses to reach out and talk to me, and I to him. All my other friends have cut ties because of my shut out behavior, and I don\u2019t blame them at all. I don\u2019t have the balls to reach out to them because I know I\u2019ve been an asshole, and Im afraid to try to mend anything because I can\u2019t say for sure that I wont do the same shit again. So that leaves me with only the people that actually want to talk with me, and I live in fear of losing him, because I would literally be completely alone then.\n\nI\u2019ve been seeing a therapist for 4 months, and I wouldn\u2019t make this post otherwise, because it would feel like just crying about stuff without doing nothing about it. Sometimes it\u2019s been helpful but I still get times like these, when I can\u2019t sleep because of this weight of my on loneliness.\n\n\nI\u2019m not strictly looking for someone to talk, like a said this is more a vent than anything. But if anyone connects to what I said in any way I would like to hear you out, maybe we can help each other.\n\nA small profile about me to see if I spark any interest besides the depressing shit above:\n\n-\tI like music, a lot of different shit but I\u2019ve been really into guitar-voice stuff these last days. Been hearing Benji by Sun kil moon, Cavalo by rodrigo amarante. Also listening to Flowerboy and the new one by Tyler TC on the regular for the past month or so.\n-\tI like watching movies, most of the times Im watching the classics Ive never seen before, but I enjoy watching some weird art house stuff as well. https://boxd.it/yL9j", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Those experiences have often shaped me into who I\u2019am today. You can learn a lot about yourself through others.

Or if he did, it was just some kind of excuse to start talking about the things that he did with her the day before... to make things worse, he also muted me on WhatsApp (I noticed he takes really long to read my messages even if he literally spends hours online).\n\nI feel really sad, these last few weeks have already been difficult enough for me and I could really use some advice from him... I've been throwing hints here and there to make him understand how I'm feeling since the last week, but it looks like he just won't listen to me this time.\n\nSoo... that's pretty much it.

I recently found out that my boyfriend and his best friend (female) have slept together in the past. What bugs me about it is not the fact that they've slept together, but that they hid it from me. They were in a very brief relationship a couple months before I had met him. Now I already felt uneasy about her but this is kinda the icing on the cake. She is very nice and sweet, but a bit older ( my boyfriend and I are 23, she is 39) so I didn't even think about the possibility of them having sex. But ever since I've found out she has been purposely pushing my buttons, like talking about sexual things with my boyfriend, getting handsy when out for drinks, calling me \"young lady\" I think it's because I'm hesitant when it comes to them hanging out. I know it was both their decision to keep it from me, but atleast my boyfriend is being nice about it and patient with my feelings. I don't believe in ultimatums, so I won't just tell him we are done with her. But I just wish he could see how snotty she is acting and address it. I really liked her before all this and saw her as a confidant but I don't know how or if our friendship can be mended.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

This is my first post like ever so if I do anything wrong about this, feel free to tell me and I'll try to amend it.   \n\n\nThis morning, a friend of mine confided in me that she found out that her ex lied to her about him playing games (\\*ahem\\* Minecraft) with me the previous night. Specifically, her and another friend caught him lying about him taking a rest from playing another game with them when he was really playing MC with me rather than resting. Now, this couple recently broke up but they still communicate together and we're in the same circle of friends. The girl has really bad mental health issues and she's working at it (and we're cheering for her!) but she has shown signs of being emotionally manipulative and downright even emotionally blackmailing certain people. I'm not sure if she's consciously doing that or if that ties into her disorder but it's been getting harder to help her since their break up even though our friend group has been supportive of her.  Lately, it seems like she's been trying to bait her ex back to her by using her issues and it's worrying all of us. Now, her ex is a really nice guy but maybe a little too nice? Like he has a bit of a hero complex and sometimes overextends himself just to please everyone so I'm guessing he lied to her so that she wouldn't think about it.   \n\n\nAnyway, back to this morning. When the girl told me that our friend, her ex, lied to her; I told her that the best way to know why and to put her mind at ease is to talk to him (they're still in talking terms and even play lol together) and not me because I didn't even know until she confronted me. I even offered to mediate their conversation if it'd make her feel any better that a third party would be present but she said she didn't want to. Instead, she proceeded to speculate about why he would lie to her, his possible reasons, and why would he do that. I told her she should stop thinking about it instead because it'll pull her into a bad state since she only seems to be focusing on the negative. I didn't want to seem insensitive but her obsessing about him can't be good for her so I just tried to guide her away from the topic but she didn't want to let it go. Eventually, she either got tired of me trying to distract her and advice or she was finally satisfied with what I said so she left.   \n\n\nThe thing is...I could've sat her down instead and told her to tell me her feelings and stuff and try to understand it but I'm a mediocre empath at best and I have my own share of emotional distress so I didn't want to as well. I was afraid that she would've have triggered me and we could've spiraled together which is something I absolutely don't want to. Did I do the right thing? Should I have been more emotionally available to her? Was it okay that I didn't take her side on what she was so worried about because I thought that she was just obsessing over her ex?   \n\n\nAlso, sorry for putting this all here. I'm not too keen on approaching my other friends with this because I don't want them to have negative opinions of our other friend. Thanks for reading, Reddit.

I didn\u2019t have any friends at all between the ages of 10 and 19, then I made a few \u201cfriends\u201d when I was 19/20 but those people didn\u2019t really care about me and quickly abandoned me which led me to not let myself get close to anyone for the next few years. I KNOW that not having friends for a long time and when I did make them having those \u201cfriends\u201d abandon me (which worsened my depression, anxiety, and self esteem issues) is probably the reason why I am so insecure about friendships now. I also felt for a long time like I didn\u2019t deserve to have friends and that no one would ever like me. \n\nNow I am spending time with better groups of people who have the same interests as me. For the first time since I was a kid, I have REALLY NICE people who initiate conversation with me about half the time and initiate with them about half the time. We like each other\u2019s social media posts, we have a great time when we spend time together, and they say positive and encouraging things to me even when they don\u2019t have to so I really believe they care about me. \n\nBut the problem is that since meeting these people I am so terrified that maybe they\u2019re just being nice and don\u2019t actually think of me as a friend, or that as a lot of them are my coworkers that they\u2019re just doing their duty to be supportive as coworkers. LOGICALLY I don\u2019t think this is the case. I have literal panic attacks about whether or not they actually consider me their friend, but I totally understand that what I believe is probably not true and just my insecurity and anxiety thinking for me. When I\u2019m freaking out I\u2019m prone to mentally listing everything that person has done to make me believe we\u2019re friends as well as everything that makes me think maybe we\u2019re not, and obsessing over how much they communicate with me, and how much they communicate with me versus their other friends. Unless they\u2019re constantly paying attention to me and validating the idea that we\u2019re friends, I start getting nervous about whether we are. \n\nIt also makes me feel so jealous when they talk to other friends of theirs equally as much as they talk to me and while I realize that people can and should have multiple friends, in my mind I have to be their very best friend or I can\u2019t be certain we\u2019re friends at all. Logically I realize these thoughts aren\u2019t accurate either, and I recognize how exaggerated my insecurities can be. \n\nInside I feel like the only way I could stop feeling insecure about this is if they literally reassured me or told me they were my friend but I also know expecting that is ridiculous and that this isn\u2019t insecurity isn\u2019t their problem at all but my own problem I need to deal with. \n\nWhat are some actions I can take to help teach myself to stop feeling so insecure about my friendships and to be able to believe people actually want to be friends with me? I want nothing more than to be able to enjoy having friends &amp; feel secure in my friendships because when I\u2019m not insecure about it, nothing feels better than knowing I have friends now. I want to be able to feel empowered in my friendship and trust that people really do care about me. \n\n\nThank you.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

But 5th grade M&amp;J got together it was ok at first but when 6th grade hit it was the beginning of the what\u2019s probably gonna be the end by this year. She started get super attached and just slowly started not talking to us without us going around the playground to talk to her. That\u2019s when me T &amp; M got in our first big argument we made up but I was still upset. That was only the tip of the iceberg. She got a phone that near the end of the year and that was a curse. She could talk to him outside of school then next thing you know she started barely messaging me and T. That summer their relationship was complete and utter TRASH. They argue over nothing \u201cbreakup\u201d then get back together like an hour later. She be at my house and have tears streaming down her face and be mad because they \u201cbroke up\u201d then was fine  in no time. Now back to present times.\n \n   Were only almost 3 months into into 7th grade and we\u2019ve had numerous fights in this short time frame. Me and T really try to convince and show M that the relationship is toxic but she says the same thing don\u2019t worry about my relationship. But the thing is SHE BRINGS US INTO IT. She LOVES to say \u201cDon\u2019t be jealous I have a boyfriend and you don\u2019t\u201d and no matter how much we tell her 1. We don\u2019t want to be in a relationship right now 2. If I was in one I hope it\u2019s the complete opposite of yours which is just plain toxic and exhausting. But to keep it short all four of us get in arguments about this subject. And I just feel super stressed because I love all of them like my own family. Because the main reason is that I\u2019m scared that M&amp;J are gonna break for-real for-real and it\u2019s gonna break her to the point she\u2019ll feel like she has no chance of ever finding love so I\u2019m trying to get it to end on a softer note but my attempts are all failing.

I'm a music lover, avid reader, football and NASCAR fan, and generally a big fan of dogs (especially my dog). I work for a \"natural/healthy\" grocery store. In theory, I'm a creative writer in my spare time, although I have trouble keeping myself focused enough to make any real progress on anything. I abhor poor grammar and spelling. (Which, by the laws of the universe, means there's going to be a glaring typo somewhere in this that I completely missed.)\n\nAnyway. Let me know if you're interested in getting to know me. Slight preferences for women and people outside of the U.S., but this is open to anyone.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I want to get to know new people since I recently connected to a lot of people and I liked it.\n\nLittle about me: I am Marc, I'm 21, I have a second Name which starts with M aswell as my surname which makes my signature look like up's and down's, into gaming, I have a dog, I love my longboard, I love to do new things and I am very chatty. Kinda the introvert but still very good with others. ADHD is me LoL.\n\nSo to keep the first part short, I search for people to (but not limited to): Talk about stuff (Animals, movies, games, your hobbies, past happenings, history etc.), playing video games, having voice chats or watchalongs with movies &amp; Netflix or Watch2Gether (if you know that) and many other things we could come up with. Having a penpal would also be interesting (and yes I know, there are communities for that).\n\nSoo, lets get into detail shall we? (I have a TL;DR further down)  \nAs mentioned earlier, I am Marc, I am german but I do have some ancestory roots that belong to the netherlands (grammar good). Nothing really interesting to tell here, besides my ancestors fleeing from germany to the netherlands back in WW2 when Gelsenkirchen with other Cities in North-Rhine-Westphalia got bombed by the Allies. Came back at 1 point in time. I'm currently doing my second attempt on my \"High-School degree(Abitur)\"for reasons you may ask me private, and I hate school. I'm happy its just this last year and then I'm done for.\n\nLike almost every other human, I like noise. Music of course dummy. My taste is.... Broad. If I had to choose 1 genre to listen to the rest of my life, it'll be Tropical House. I freaking love summer vibes, but also listening to Hardstyle, Metal, Heavymetal, EDM etc... Listing all of em would make this text longer than it already is goddamn it.\n\nFor gamers:  \nI pretty much play a broad variety of games like Rainbow Six: Siege, Hell let loose, War Thunder, Monster Hunter World and many more. I'm a PC exclusive player and if you want to know what we could play together, I'll send you my Steam-ID. I occationally stream my game sessions and also have a YT-channel for \"highlights\". Currently waiting for the PC release of RDR2.\n\nIt's hard to describe my own personality, since you never see yourself objectively as others do but I try.  \nSince I have ADHD I am SUUUUPER talkative, sometimes even a little bit awkward, not gonna lie. I love to flirt for fun, sometimes even doing that with my male friends since I couldn't care less haha, for a lot of people charismatic I suppose (hence the reason I got a lot of my games gifted in my library), a dog and wolf \"fanatic\" and I love to be in charge if I can handle the situation. I'm straight forward (heart on tongue kinda guy) so I usally tell whatever I think, being too honest. My humor is something most people don't get, and that's fine, we all different hoomans. I don't have a \"heavy\" german accent as most germans have. Just sometimes.\n\nSo now that I look super incredible and awesome (jokes on me), lets get to some negatives.  \nSince ADHD has been and still is a huge part of my life, I tend to forget A LOOOOOT of things. Don't be upset if you tell me your whole life story and in 2 weeks I remember nothing until I got like 1 or 2 keywords that reactivate my grey cells. I am super terrible with dates so I usally don't bother with birthdays. I tilt very fast, and much so. Sometimes my humor is VERY INAPPROPRIATE. I struggle from time to time to understand when specific comments are okay and when not (if you get what I mean). Sometimes I can't handle multi-tasking since my brain just says \"No fam, not now\", so sometimes i doze off, and then be like \"Sorry what?, I wasn't paying attention\". I do have anxieties that we could talk about when we click, since hard past and terrible childhood. I tend to overthink a lot, so sometimes I understand things wrong and then be like \"Did he/she/them meant it this or that way, what is X suppose to mean\" and so on. Also I'm a stubborn fellow. the last thing, I love to be the center of attention.\n\nI try to be as active as I possibly can, even with people living in different time zones. It is always very interesting to talk about things you like, for me it may be Star Wars, Movies &amp; Series and for you it might be foreign politics, Disney or the universe. I \"suffer\" from ADHD, which sometimes leads to problems and for some people it's just an stupid excuse for not paying attention or being to hyperactive but everyone affected by this knows, it is real. To this day, I notice how much of a bummer it can be. Basically for me one of the big things is that I really struggle to finish what I start, especially when I'm not enjoying it, and holding back emotions. I am extremely emotional from time to time.\n\nOther than that, I really love to connect to others, get to know em, play games with em or whatever happens. Discord is a huge thing for me since I can call people all over the world and talk about all kinds of nonsense. I don't really have a specific clue what I'm searching for. So Yeah, sorry for all that text.\n\nTL;DR  \nMarc, 21, German, having ADHD and all I wanna do is sociallize with all sorts of people.\n\nIf you want to get to know me more than here already, or ask me more things, I am very happy to do so :) Just Dm me or comment, I don't know haha", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

{"post_id": "djs6kj", "created_utc": 1571425560, "title": "The final embers of a special friendship", "author": "NoExpectations10", "self_text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI need some advice to get out of feeling miserable everyday. I had an argument with a new good friend of mine for 6 months, and I really don't think I was at fault (I know everyone says this, but I think it's true in my case).  If it helps, I'm a male and the friend is a female. So I'm friends with her (A) and her roommate (B). I was a bit annoyed at A because she didn't show up on my birthday (she had some issues, but she apparently had the time to go to some other friend's place. Normally I don't mind this, but I just thought that she would want to hang out on my birthday. Maybe this is over-demanding of me, but I guess that's another storyline altogether). Anyways, I was pissed at A because of that, took it out a bit on B, told the reason to B, apologized to B and B and I are fine now. However, B blabbed to A (inspite of me telling not to) and A went all Dog Day Afternoon on me. I think this was a bit too much, because I didn't badmouth A at all. I just told B that I took out a bit of anger from A on you, and I'm really sorry. But A started flinging accusations at me. And this was one day before a very important exam of mine. \n\nSo that week we did nothing, no talking, no seeing each other. The end of the week, we met up to talk. Now when friends sort stuff out, usually there's an urge to make up from both sides right? She did say she was sorry, but she was more insistent on pointing out where *I* went wrong. But we were at least back on speaking terms I guess. Anyways, I was just happy to be on talking terms and everything was fine for a day. \n\nNow it was B's birthday in a few days. So there's a decent sized friend group, but A and B are not directly part of that group. So the group asked me to ask A what the plans were. I asked A, was met with a bit of a cold shoulder, then A said that they have plans. I conveyed the same to the group. I was not crystal clear (because I didn't want to sound rude) , but someone from the group asked B what the plans were. Apparently this ruined up A's plans, and she again went all out on me. I never expected this from a friend who I considered close. She's angry texting all sorts of stuff at me, and then she's saying she's tired of all this shit? How does that work out?\n\nSo there were these 2 arguments, none of them direct, in a span of a week and our friendship has collapsed. Now suddenly we've gone from hanging out almost everyday to not talking properly for almost a month now. Even though I feel I have been wronged, I still try to revive the friendship because A means a lot to me. However, I'm always met with sentences like \"I'm not in a good space right now\", or monosyllabic replies to my texts, or being busy to meet up and no plans to reschedule. What confuses me is that how come this friendship, which meant a lot to me, now means nothing to her? Not talking is killing me, and it seems to have no effect on her. I really don't know what I've done that's so wrong to warrant this sort of behavior. I know I may seem defensive in this post, but I really feel this way. We went from really good friends to a complete embargo in 1 week.\n\nAny ideas on how to deal with this? I just expect that if this friendship meant this much to both of us (which I think it did), I would hope that she would at least be willing to talk it out and reach equal grounds. She always keeps asking for space, and I've given it all the time. Now I just feel that it's too drawn out to ever go back to what it was.\n\nThere was a bit of sunshine where she was texting OK for one day, but then it's back to monosyllabic replies now. I finally said that I really miss you and miss what we had and if she would like to meet up sometime. I've been responded with nothing.\n\nI'd be happy to give more details if anyone would be willing to help me get out of this. I know the mess is convoluted, and I really appreciate all the people who read it till the end.\n\nThank you so much,", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We had the most amazing relationship, we would tell each other everything, and anything. I really felt like she was my best friend. We would go out every single weekend and have fun, only us. We have the memorable memories. She stood up for me whenever I needed it and gave me advice all the time, and I would do the same thing for her too.\n\nThe thing is, something broke. I went to a party once and I was so drunk that I kissed a girl (it was only once, last year, I was so done with boys - a guy had just ghosted me, and I had multiple bad experiences with men in general) (I'm not gay nor bi, I was just having fun, I never slept with any woman and I don't want to) and I told my bff about it. She laughed, but started acting all weird ever since then. I remember coming to her house and her mentioning a friend of mine - that used to go to my uni, this guy was SO MUCH FUN - and when she talked about him she said \"Oh, he was \\*cough cough\\* gay\" she just said it in such a weird way it made me uncomfortable.\n\nAnd a couple weeks ago (I'm talking this year, SEPTEMBER 2019 - I kissed the girl back in august 2018!!, let that go girl!!)  we went with my bff and another friend to the park to chat.\n\nAnd I remember we started talking about the best sex ever had, and I started mentioning the guys I had sex with (let me repeat - SEX) and then my bff says, in front of my other friend, \"and a WOMAN\" and I was like wtf girl. First of all why would you say something so stupid? I never had sex with another woman but she was saying that I did.\n\nAnd all our conversations just would go to the gay side, like, she would start talking to me about the bi culture in Hollywood (which I think rocks) but Idk, it's like she's weird about it.\n\nAnd then... this one crushed me. We have elections this year, and we have this kind of preliminar elections where we vote for president; but not acually, it's like a poll to know which president will win. And then we have the actual elections this month. Well, me and my bff we have different political views - and she liked a tweet that said \"the people who move out of this country are the ones with money and capitalists who know no better\" and other hate stuff. The thing is... I might leave... and I feel weird about leaving my country,  but the thing is we have no choice... and I got so mad when I read that. Because I told her about it, and all she could say is \"how much she is going to miss me if I go\". Like... that's so fake. Stop. Being. So. Fake.\n\nWhat hurt me the most was that, she has that view about me - and also she's a politics fanatic, like, she's a FANATIC. I have to admit that I have liked a couple of tweets about politics too, but it really did hurt me that she thinks that way about people leaving the country - that they are capitalists with money and another dumb stuff. And that I might leave it, and all she could do was being fake to me. I was so so so mad that day, it lasted to this day, Because it hurts leaving here. You leave your family behind. It's so sad for me, but I have to pursue a better future for myself and future family.\n\nAlso, when we text, she takes 9 hours or so to reply to me, but uses other social media accounts, when at the same time, when a dude would do the same thing to me, all she would say to me - as advice - is that the dude was ignoring me. So she is my bff and ignores me, the same way fuckboys did. Smh.\n\nNow I don't feel like texting her any more, besides, if I never tell her about going out to a club or something, she never does, it's like I have to do that all the time. And I'm staying away from alcohol and weed, which she may think it's stupid, so maybe that's why she's not inviting me out. She doesn't even invite me to her house, or to do ANYTHING, it's all via text. Which I thought was good, and cool, but when she told me that \"text messages are the dumbest thing to mantain a relationship\" I went like whoa. So our entire relationship is fake? I don't know...\n\nWhat do you guys think? And, like, we have groups in common that invite us to do things together but she always says that she can't - they're all excuses because she doesn't want to see me.

It took no time at all for him to respond with 'thats good, did you like the D pick I sent you?' (His exact words.) After questioning her about this she confessed that she had been meeting up with him to chat about an assignment. (I wasn't convinced) after sending another message to him on her phone stating it was me using her phone I mysteriously got a call from him. I couldn't say a single word before he shouted 'F*CK YOU, she's mine and why dont you die as nobody will give a sh*t about you!' As stunned as I was at this point I didn't know what to say. My GF who is now me ex said that it was all just a misunderstanding. But she couldn't make a good excuse about all the nudes she had sent to him.

Earlier this year, I saw Rene constantly posting things about her boyfriend (like tagging him in posts and taking lots of pictures with him). So I decided to go on his Facebook and see who he was. I was looking through his photos and saw all of this stuff supporting white supremacy. Not only that, every photo she took of him he was doing a hand sign associated with the aryan brotherhood of Texas. (I had to consult Google on the hand sign) Being black, I was highly uncomfortable and offended by what I saw. How can someone have friends who are minorities and date someone who believes minorities are inferior?? Make it make sense please!!!!!\n\nFor a few weeks I started to mentally battle with myself over Rene, her boyfriend, and our friendship. First I tried to make excuses for myself to preserve our friendship: thinking I was being too sensitive because none of her other minority friends seem to have a problem. Then I thought about speaking with Rene about it. I definitely didn\u2019t want to discuss this online, but I was also afraid of the possibility of her boyfriend being around during this conversation. I didn\u2019t wanna be anywhere near him, and I didn\u2019t wanna hear what he had to say about me not being fond of him.\n\nIt\u2019s not in my nature to tell people who they should and shouldn\u2019t date. We\u2019re both adults in our twenties, and Rene can do what she wants. But I\u2019m not going to associate myself with that. Who you date is typically a reflection of your own morals and values. With that in mind, I started to think very differently about Rene, and I thought to myself \u201cWhat went wrong?!\u201d \u201cWere there any signs?!?\u201d Then I thought about our time during high school and remembered some things:\n\n-She tried to convince me that it was okay for anyone, including her, to say the n-word. I told her nobody should be saying that word, and she goes and calls refers to me as that to one of her friends. (Not with the hard \u201cr\u201d, but it makes no difference to me)\n-She\u2019s patronized me before over using public transportation. I told her once that if I couldn\u2019t immediately get a car out of high school (which I still don\u2019t have at 24), I wouldn\u2019t have a problem using our town\u2019s bus system. She replied that she was definitely gonna get a car because she doesn\u2019t want to be dependent on anyone. (I know we want cars to be more independent, but the way she said it made me feel ashamed to use the bus)\n-She\u2019s told me that black people are lazy and don\u2019t work for anything.\n-She\u2019s called me and \u201cOreo\u201d, and has told me that I\u2019m \u201cwhite,\u201d not black plenty of times.\n-Made stereotypical remarks to me. (Ex. \u201cBut you\u2019re black.\u201d \u201cWhy do black people....?\u201d \u201cWhy are black people...?\u201d)\n-When she was around her friends, she would sometimes ignore me and talk to them. We would be talking, and when I\u2019m responding to her, she\u2019ll turn around and go off talking to one of her friends.\n-We don\u2019t even have the same interests.\n-Towards 11th grade, I stopped eating lunch with her, because I dreaded being around her. I dreaded the classes I had with her too.\n-She once got mad that a classmate wasn\u2019t doing work in our group. But Rene was doing everything on her own, and didn\u2019t give the other girl a chance or opportunity to contribute. The same thing happened when one of my friends did group work with us.\n\nMind you, I was bullied throughout middle school, and it made me become very \u201cclosed off\u201d to people. I was insecure and I didn\u2019t like myself AT ALL, so much that I hated being black and wish I wasn\u2019t my race. It got so bad I considered bleaching my skin. I know I should\u2019ve said something about those remarks, I really wanted to. But my self esteem was so low I was too afraid to stand up for myself, and I felt it was useless. So I just became a doormat. When I think about it now, I feel that she knew I was insecure about myself and had a feeling I wasn\u2019t going to respond to her remarks.\n\nNow that I\u2019m in college and gaining more self esteem and confidence, I realized that\u2019s not what friends do. All my other non-black friends never said anything like that to me, or would tolerate that themselves. They would actually build me up and ask about me, and I did the same to them. I can\u2019t remember Rene ever doing that. After reflecting, I decided to un-friend her. No discussion, no explanation why. Part of me feels bad for not talking to her, but the other part of me is telling myself the flags were there a long time ago. Now she works at the same place I work at, but in a different department. It\u2019s been about a couple of months since I unfriended her and she hasn\u2019t sent me a friend request. Maybe she didn\u2019t even notice, or maybe she doesn\u2019t care. But if she wants to know why I unfriended her, I\u2019ll just have to put on my adult pants and throw it all on the table. The thought of having that conversation worries me, but I know I need to assert myself if I don\u2019t wanna be a \u201cdoormat\u201d anymore. No matter how Rene feels, I don\u2019t want to be friends with her any longer. After her recent boyfriend and reflecting on our friendship, I see her differently. I have too much self respect now to let someone like that back in my friend circle.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

{"post_id": "djwja7", "created_utc": 1571445385, "title": "Protect your energy. Cut the toxic out.", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "This is a long one (sorry, not sorry).\n\nLast weekend I cut out a toxic friend for good, turned off and I've never felt better.\n\nLet's call her Amy.\n\nAmy and I met in grade 9 but didn't get close till grade 11/12. We both had friends in multiple groups in school and would mix our friends with other groups when we hung out. Amy and I came from totally different lives. I consider my family and I as middle class, average and hers was upper class, not that it mattered to me. But by grade 12, Amy lost many friendships because of her blunt comments to people and their ways/ choices of living. If people weren't living the way she was, it was the wrong way. She could never bite her tongue and blamed others for not wanting to be her friend. I always stood up for Amy because she was a good person in small doses and I hoped she would wake up on day and for once, think about what she says before she says it. Boy, was I wrong.\n\nFast forward 6 years, she became worse and worse by the year. She's had so many failed friendships and relationships and continued to blame everyone else but herself. Amy was an excellent debater, as if she were waiting to be triggered just to unleash her talent at arguing. Amy loves to complain, that's basically her hobby and it drove me up the wall. Below are a few things that she did to make me slowly dim her out of my life:\n\n1. It was a special day for me. My boyfriend was graduating from firefighting recruit class and being vowed into a municipality, starting his new career that he worked incredibly hard for. It was a day for celebration. Amy decided it was a day to rant and bitch about her ex boyfriend of 3 years and his career choices. She messaged me that morning and said how its a waste when people don't have jobs that tie into their education. To which, I briefly responded to by saying that many people do that, its a norm. She then started blowing up my phone saying that I wasn't being a supportive friend. I was so annoyed and told to bite her tongue, to which she told me to shut up. I ignored her for the rest of the day because a) It's an ex boyfriend, b) who cares? c) who cares?\n2. Amy and I have completely different career paths. She went to school for biochemisty/ something else related to that and then enrolled into a naturopath med school. I am in marketing/ advertising. While I was in school, I would send her snaps of when I was ace an exam, test, essay or whatever and she would do the same. One day, I guess she was having a rough day (I didn't know) and I sent her snap of me acing a really hard exam. She then told me that me getting good grades was putting her down because she was never an A student, that she barely got into med school. I found that so rude and disrespectful. I mean, pardon? You can't be happy for my success? Need to drag me down with you?\n3. Last year my 8 year old Weimaraner/ Lab mix dog passed away within a span of 3 days. It was really hard for my whole family and I. Still hurts me because my buddy, Gus was so young. The night he passed, I was a total wreck. Amy texted me saying she's sorry but that she couldn't come by because she was going to paint night with a friend. Amy always called me her best friend, I could never bring myself to call her that back, because my actual best friend is a total saint of a person and I've never had a problem with her, let's call her Heather. Heather and I don't see each other often because our schedules are always opposite, but that doesn't change our friendship. Heather dropped all her plans that night, picked me up from the animal hospital, made sure my car was going to be driven home by someone else, drove me to my sister's and stayed with me till I fell asleep around 3am. She was incredible and I am forever grateful. Amy, didn't check in with me till a couple days later because she was \"busy\". I strongly stand by the saying \"it's not about having time, it's about making time\".\n4. Amy and her boyfriend James, broke up before her trip. They went out for 8 months and were such a bad pair. She was very high maintenance and he wasn't. They had totally different interests and didn't really care that much about each other. They both just cared about the sex. Amy kept trying to mould him into her ideal boyfriend which caused endless arguments. All of her friends told her to break up because they just weren't compatible and there was no point to force a relationship. She ignored everyone. The hour they broke up, Amy demanded that I came over regardless of me telling her that I had an exam the next morning. She kept whining, so I went over and watched her cry for 2 hours.\n5. Two summers ago, Amy did an au pairing gig in Italy for 2 months- that's where you are a nanny/ teaching English to people's kids and living with the family. Amy landed a sweet gig with a family that was incredibly generous. She went on their boat and sailed to Croatia to spend the day jumping off the boat into the Adriatic. They event spent a couple of weeks in the mountainside of Italy, just because. They also gave her a car to drive while she was there, but since it was manual, she couldn't. Last summer, that same family called her up and asked her if she wanted to come back, she said yes, obviously. They paid for her flight, accommodation, food, drinks, trips around Europe, bought her gifts, everything. Yet, she still had something to complain about. She complained that the grandfather whistled every morning and that it annoyed her to her core, then she would judge the mother's spending habits. Mind you, this family was very well off and they had money to spend, but also, who cares. Before she went on this trip, she and I had plans to meet up and exchange birthday gifts as she would be away for both. I suggested we go out and treat each other before she goes away. She told me she wanted $40 bucks so she can go out with friends when she's back at school. That ticked me off a bit because am I not a friend she can do that with? Anyway, we made plans to go for brunch on the Saturday before she left. We both went out the night before (not together). I made sure to be home at a decent hour, so I could get up in time to meet with her. The morning of, we planned that I picked her up at 11am. It was 1045am and she messages me telling me that she was too sick and that she's not going to hang out and doesn't have time later because her mom was hosting an early bday party for her. We picked that day because I couldnt any other day and then she bails because she decided to get wasted the night before and kick me to the curb. The next couple of days, she kept sending me snaps of her friend Ashley and how Ashley was making time to see her, blah, blah, blah. The day she was leaving, Amy sent me a snap of Ashley and wrote \"Ashley came to wish me a safe trip and even brought me my bday gift\". I felt like she was rubbing it in my face but I didn't reply.\n\nDuring the month she was away, I had peace from her and it was amazing. I loved being 6 hours apart from her. That's when I realized that life is so much better without her, she was dramatic af and caused drama out of nothing.\n\n6. When she got back from her trip, it took a month for us to get together because our schedules never aligned. We got together one night and there was so much tension from what happened before she left- but since nobody addressed it, it was just shoved under the rug. It was an awkward hang out and there were many awkward silences, I was excited when the night ended.\n\n7. Her grandmother lives about an hour away and Amy is so busy that she \"doesn't have time to go see her\". Until one day, her grandmother told her grandkids that she will give them money to come to her birthday. Her grandma gave $5,000 bucks to each kid that came, including Amy. She cashed it right away because she was afraid her grandmother would cancel it. It was so pathetic to me that she had to get paid to go visit family. All of my relatives are in Europe and I don't get to see them often. I would'nt take money just to go see them. They are family, I make time for them.\n\nI still had her recent ex on Instagram because why not. One day, he posted a sick pic of himself on a jet ski in the air, so I liked it. Hours later, I got a text from Amy bitching at me for liking the picture and being told to stop liking his pictures. That was my final straw. I ignored her and that was it. I couldn't handle her rude comments, she could never talk anything out calmly without giving attitude and assuming the worst of people. She doesn't understand how to treat her friends. She acted as if everyone was always against her and I couldn't handle it anymore. I understand that most people wouldn't want their friends being in contact with their exes but the way she handled it was enough for me. I've tried to talk things out with her before but that didn't work, arguing didn't work. What did work? Cutting her out of my life.\n\n3 weeks later, during the Thanksgiving weekend (always picks the best times to bitch) she texted me long text messages bitching about why I didn't reply to her about her ex's pic. She said really mean things, calling me a joke, a bitch, stupid, a child, a liar, etc, etc. I didn't give her the reaction she wanted. I kept it short and told her that I'm not her doormat. I cannot be friends with someone that bitches at people non stop and expects to constantly apologize for their behaviour, to walk on egg shells around her. She continued to bitch me out and was dumb enough to think this whole thing was because I liked her ex's picture. Her head was so far up her ass that she can't understand why I would cut her out, obviously it wouldn't be for liking a fucking picture. It's her as a whole, her personality. She's controlling, manipulative and a narcissist. I blocked her off all social media. The next day, she decided to bitch to one of my friends that I introduced to Amy and tried to turn that friend against me. That friend left Amy on read because what the fuck, were not in high school anymore, my friend couldn't be bothered. Amy left her alone after that- she lost.\n\nOther things she did:\n\n\\- Send pics of people we know in DMs and make negative comments about their bodies and life choices.\n\n\\- Talk really poorly of her family and say really mean things about them. Her family does SO much for her and she's too blind to realize how fortunate she actually is.\n\n\\- Judge me, my family, my friends, everyone on the planet.\n\n\\- Spent $400 bucks on a perm on her parent's credit card, the perm didn't work, instead of telling the salon, she complained to me. She spent boat loads of money on her parent's credit cards for shopping whenever she pleased, then would complain about the cost of living.\n\n\\- Complained about her summer job changing some parts of her job but offering her $2 bucks more.\n\n\\- Fished for compliments, then rejected them.\n\n\\- Her parents gave her an older but functional car to drive, she complained and said it was embarrassing.\n\n\\- She could never stand up for herself when someone older said something blunt to her, instead she would go complain to me.\n\nI had ENOUGH. Amy was a brat and I needed to start protecting my energy. I cut her cold turkey and life has been great. Peaceful.\n\nIf I can do it, you can too. If you're not happy, cut out whatever is in the way of that. Be selfish.\n\nTL;DR I had an insanely toxic friend that did nothing but wear me down. I cut her out cold turkey and I feel amazing.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

It\u2019s my first year of college and one of the major things that has been on my mind since last year is how to make friends. In high school, I had a couple of people who I talked to and was close with, but it wasn\u2019t a close relationship where I told them every single detail of my life. I do notice that I have trust issues when it comes to other people and I keep my boundary because I don\u2019t want to be hurt in the long run. I don\u2019t like to open up to people that much because I don\u2019t know who will stay and who will be there later on. I rather avoid the mess and not say too much.\n\nAn example that proves my point is the relationship I had with a friend coming into college. We were friends, one of my closest friends, with since my first year of high school and when we came to college and everything changed. We aren\u2019t friends anymore and when we see each other it feels very hostile. \n\nI made new friends here and it is a big group of us, about 8 people. Everyone seems to be building close relationships with each other and I feel left out. I feel as if they have their relationship with one another and I\u2019m the one standing on the outside looking in. Usually I just stay to myself and stay out the way because why would I want to be around people who I don\u2019t feel comfortable around. One of the girls told me that the others were saying that I\u2019m a very confidential person and that I need to open up more. I understand what they are saying, but I can\u2019t open up to a big group of people like that. I can barely open up to one person so how can I open up to eight? This makes me want to hide and not interact with them as much, but I know it isn\u2019t the right thing to do? What should I do? I can\u2019t just open up to people out of nowhere and I feel as if they all have this \u201chate\u201d or \u201cnegative idea\u201d about me now. What should I do?", "subreddit": "friendship"}

With that out of the way,here's a bit about me:\n\n\u2022 I speak Serbian,English,German and a tad bit of French.\n\n\u2022 I love drawing,traditional and digital. I also love animation,one of my hobbies includes making animated pixel-art, I'm looking to expand upon it further.\n\n\u2022 I love a good book,no matter the genre,although I'm keen on fantasy/sci-fi,mystery and thriller. As for my fave book,I don't have one,can't really decide. :D \n\n\u2022 I really like reading comic books,because of their art-style,narrative and presentation. Whether it's Marvel or DC or some lesser-known stuff like Dylan Dog (hit me up Italian peeps!),if it's good on any of those 3 aspects I'm gonna read it.\n\n\u2022 I play video games a lot (Minecraft,Warframe,Borderlands 2 etc.),I like learning more about computers in general,be it about software or hardware.\n\n\u2022 I enjoy chilling and binge watching TV shows or movies.\n\n\u2022 My music taste is pretty broad. The genre doesn't matter,as long as it's good,but my favourite genres are rock,pop,electronic and so much more. As for my favourite bands/singers,I'd say Arctic Monkeys,Jimi Hendrix,Daft Punk,David Bowie and so on and so forth.\n\n\u2022 I adore electric guitars,looking forward to buying one and playing it.\n\nI enjoy casual walks,hikes,jogging,basketball and light workouts.\n\n\u2022 I'm light-hearted and witty,~~my jokes are also shitty~~,sarcastic and ocassionally awkward. I'm a good listener and I've been through some stuff myself,so if anyone needs a friendly voice,feel free to talk to me.\n\nAnd,that would be it! I'd say that I'm a pretty mixed bag and that there's something for everyone,so,if I piqued your interest even a bit,feel free to PM me.\n\nCheers!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

We were good friends and everything was great. She recently moved to a different state to pursue her goals and dreams, and out of 80% of her other friends saying that it's a terrible idea, I was very supportive. In fact, I helped her submit the paperwork for admission into the college for her Master's Degree.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEver since she moved, she became the type of person that would do everything that she would shame other girls for doing. Some of the examples would be, hooking up with random dudes just for as simple as they smile at her, compete with other girls on how many of them can get the most guys and go with them. Never interfered as that was none of my business, but when she'd call me and tell me about them and ask me, I'd tell her to be careful because these don't usually end up well (Emotionally and in other ways). Lots of times she'd tell me she's thankful that I'm a genuine friend to her who keeps her from doing crazy things (even tho she does regardless, but sometimes she does listen).\n\nNow that she is dating around, all her \"potential Boyfriends\" were wondering about the reason why she still talks to her Ex, which is me. She always told me that if someone questions that, that they do NOT respect her or her choices. In someway I do agree. I mean when we were dating, she was talking to her ex and I never thought that would be an issue, after all, she chooses to be with me. I was not her first and that's ok.\n\nShe is now pursuing a long-distance relationship with someone who hasn't talked to her since early college days, and once he had a breakup with his girlfriend, he started reaching out to her on social media and even flew to see her, all in less than 4 days. She told me she's ready to pursue a relationship with this person, and that she'd be putting much time into him, and won't be able to call and check up on me anything more than once every 2 weeks. I was like really? but then stayed silent as I tried to understand She goes ahead and tells me how he's the best person she's ever met (She seriously dated 5 guys after me, all of which were the best ever. Like he took her to a restaurant and paid for it and literally said no one has ever done that for her, even tho in these 7 months all our lunch and dinner was on me, but again stayed silent). Today, she tells me that he and his friends and questioning if he should be pursuing her, given that she's far away from him and she's not willing to relocate to live with him. She got hurt, then he goes and tells her that she's the type of person who talks to her Ex's and more. I learned from her, and that kind of hit me in the head, that she told him about my medical condition, which can be fatal and that it is the only thing that is keeping her talking to me. She told me if I can't accept this, she doesn't care what I think and I can go ahead and not talk to her because she can totally live without needing me. I told her we all can but why is this going this far? She just tells me she doesn't care.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI confront her as to how does she have the audacity to share my medical condition with him? I mean I reserve the right to that at least. After all, we were friends because we've been there for each other, have friends in common, up to the point that I know her family very well and very close to them. She always told me she believes in me, and always will have my back...etc. I feel hurt because not for a single second I thought she'd see me like this. She's claiming that my sickness is part of her story, and she won't hide the \"truth\" to anybody or cover my ass about anything. Not sure how my own medical condition is the truth, nor covering up MY ASS. It's not like I'm dating.\n\nI don't have many friends, and to be honest I'm an introvert who doesn't open up to people, and especially after this incident, I'm not very sure how I can trust people altogether. Am I in the wrong here? did I do anything wrong? I'm telling myself I rather know I'm wrong at least I can fix something but to see this, is truly breaking my heart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm very sorry for this long message and probably bad English.

I am so lucky. \n\nI know you\u2019ll still be around, but it don\u2019t think it will be the same. I was damn miserable when you were gone. I\u2019m not saying I was unhappy with you at all. You needed to be where you were. And I\u2019m so glad you could do that for your girls and for yourself. I really am! That\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying.

I love how close we are. I really can\u2019t describe it to be honest. \n\nI know it\u2019s not a for sure if you\u2019re even going to like it. But you are going to be successful at it. I hate to even say it, but selfishly, I hope you don\u2019t like it. And things will be normal again. But that\u2019s not fair to you. I only want you to be happy and really enjoy life and your job.

She always does it with other people around, oftentimes people I don\u2019t know well and while I\u2019m enjoying myself and it\u2019s the furthest thing from my mind. I haven\u2019t asked her about it, but she did it again for maybe the 3rd time last weekend. I lied and said \u201cI burned myself\u201d and she goes \u201cwhy cuz you were sad?\u201d And had a smirk on her face. \n\nWhy would anyone be that way? It\u2019s just fucking beyond me. \n\nLater that same night her and her boyfriend got all coked out and tried pressuring me into having a threesome with them and i was just disgusted. I got the vibe like they had been plotting it for a long time and once I left their house I decided I\u2019m done talking to either one of them.\n\nOk rant done, but I\u2019m just a loss as to how I can find truly solid people. These two I just spoke of have a gigantic group of friends at their disposal and I have nobody and I just don\u2019t get it.\n\nHow can I be better at deciphering true loyalty from this bullshit?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

She seems very bubbly and friendly towards everyone. I like working with her as she doesn't just treat me as a colleague, but also someone that matters. \n\nBut the thing is that, she just seems too friendly, to the point that you're not sure if she actually considers you as a genuine friend. \n\nI got attached to her store a few weeks ago and we had been working together again ever since.\n\nHowever, the strange thing is that she told me very openly that she was hanging out with some other guy from my store, whom I'm not really friends with. \n\nMy response to her was-\n\n\"And you're telling me this because....??\"\n\nI mean really, telling me this is not just irrelevant, but its also telling me that they met up without bothering to invite me. \n\nShe didn't respond to my question after that. \n\nIts not like I have any beef with the guy, but its just that like most of the people from my store, he treats me mostly as a colleague than a friend. So this made it a shock to me when I learned that they were hanging out haha. \n\nAnd then a few days ago, she told me that the guy dropped by her store, when I wasn't on shift and sarcastically told me that shes telling me this because hes from my store. She then invited me to have supper with her and some other people but I turned her down not just because that I really did not have time, but also because that she may had only asked me out of sympathy.\n\nFurthurmore, during the first few days of being attached to her store, she once asked me via whatsapp to accompany her to a tattoo studio to consult with a tattoo artist I recommended her to. But when I agreed and asked her when she wanted to visit the artist, she suddenly cut me off, telling me that she still needed to think over her tattoo design as well as saying that she still did not have enough money to get a new tattoo at the moment. \n\nOk, I wouldn'tly say that she cut me off, but she could have at least told me that she can think it over. I mean, she was the one who asked me to accompany her after all. \n\nEver since these episodes, I'm now doing my best to only be friends with her at work, which means that I don't bother to keep in touch or meet up with her anywhere else. Recently, she answered to an insta story of mine, which featured an awesome Ramen I had, asking me where I had it. I just gave her the name of the place and told her to try it, without recommending myself to show her the place in case if she cut me off again. \n\nI just don't know if I should just mantain this shallow level of friendship with her since shes already going overseas to study anyway.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

In public I sadly don't have many friends and most of my friends are on here from Reddit. They have been so awesome and nice and I can't thank them enough.  I was hoping I can make friends with more people like that. Don't worry about those I'm already talking with I will still talk with you. Just trying to expand my friends list. \n\nI graduated from college with a degree in film mostly focusing on editing. I suffer from both anxiety and depression. It effects me a lot on day to day basis mostly depression. Some days I'm fine Some I'm not. So if I complain about being depressed please understand I can't control it and at least be sympathetic towards it. \n\nI'm somewhere on the autism spectrum probably closer associated with aspergers. Its not as severe as other people probably. Like you wouldn't think i have It because I'm on the high functioning side of the spectrum. However my social skills are really bad which makes it difficult to make friends in real life. \n\nIn terms of Hobbies. My favorite stuff to do is watch movies or tv shows. Some of my favorite movies are The Dark Knight, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, and Apocalypse Now. Some of my favorite tv shows currently are Big Little Lies, The Handmaid's Tale, Black Mirror, Stranger Things, Westworld, Rick and Morty, American Horror Story, Barry and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. However I watch a lot of other movies and shows as well. I'm also big Fan of Star Wars, Game of Thrones, and Marvel. So feel free to give me suggestions on movies or shows to watch\n\nI love animals particularly Dogs and hamsters. Huskies are my favorite breed but I also love bulldogs. Sadly I don't have a dog or any pet but, would love one in the future. \n\nI'm a big WWE fan or at least try to watch what I can. Been watching since 2006. So if you like WWE that would be awesome. \n\nI love rock music from the 70s-90. My favorite bands are (AC/DC, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Guns N Roses, Kiss, Metallica, and Queen). \n\nOther things I like are to learn about history, conspiracy theories/mysteries even though I don't believe most of them, Memes, and Sports (particular baseball/American football) \n\nSo yeah feel free to message me if any of these things interest you \ud83d\ude03. If you going to message me I recommend you being around my age at least 19-27. I can make some exceptions though. \n\nImportant, don't bother sending me a message if your just going to ghost. It really hurts and I don't like doing that either to others unless we don't connect or something. Also I  don't like when a conversation fizzles out and I don't ever hear from you again. It's fine if your forgot to respond but, I usually think if it fizzles out and you never get back to me. That you don't care to talk again. \n\nDon't care what gender just want friends who share interests to talk. I have Whatsapp, kik, Snapchat and, Discord but I want to keep the conversation on Reddit for now. Until we get to know each other more. I prefer the pm message box and not the chat but whatever works for you.

Should I still be friends with her ?", "author": "Ssagani", "self_text": "!! - Long Post Ahead -!!\n\nMe and my friend (let's call her Freya) became best friends pretty quickly because I was one of the rare persons she could talk to about her family problems ( She lives with her sisters that are kind of emotionally abusive towards her) and I have no problem listening to her stories and complaints in her life. Fast foward 3 years later, we went to university, different universities, and our timetable doesn't really line up and, since she's still living with her sister, she can't go out often so we rarely see or call each other anymore so we distanced ourselves a bit.\nOne time, she had the opportunity to call me and I expressed my wish to learn how to drive, then she started asking me this question : \"How are you going to afford a car ?\" (My family is a bit financially not well off but not struggling) and I replied to her that I don't have to worry about that, since my parents would support me. They were the ones who wanted me to get my drivers license. After that Freya, went of to a tangent (she wants to be a lawyer or study political science) of how the climate change *yadda yadda yadda*, I was starting to eat food directed towards vegan consumers and me getting a car doesn't line up with my agenda, so I was bullshitting.\n\nFirst of all, I never stated that I was a vegan or a environmental activist. I wasn't spreading that agenda at all. So I got upset, I wasn't lying to anybody and I felt that she doesn't have that right to call me out because even she wasn't a 100% environmentally friendly, just like me. So I tried to refute her arguments but she claimed that it was not the same : \"I did not bought new clothes for about 8 months now\" ; \"I'm trying to limit my meat consumption.\" in a 'I'm holier than thou tone'.\n\nI got even more mad and I called her out : \"You made that narrative up in your head, I never once proclaimed I was vegan or an environmental activist ! I wasn't \"bullshitting\" anyone.\"\n\nCue the excuse, \"Oh but the french \"bullshit\" (sometimes english words in France has a slightly diffrent meaning) doesn't really mean the same bullshit you use in english... \"\n\nIt wasn't until I broke down and clearly stated that I was hurt that she would assume that I was a hypocrite that she said sorry\n\nShe said sorry and I forgave her.\n\nA month later (today), she calls me and I ask her about her day, a normal conversation. She then went off into this tangent :\n\n\"Hey are you in the countryside (where my parents live) or are you in the city (where I live monday-friday usually because of university) ?\"\n\nI answered, \"No, I'm in the city.\"\n\n\"Oh okay, do you have a monthly subscription for your week-end trips to the countryside ?\" Freya asked.\n\nMe happy to explain : \" I didn't get the monthly subscription because I already paid for my subway+bus annual subscription. I calculated the total cost and it isn't worth the about + 800\u20ac/year but I think I would make a discount card !\"\n\n\"Oh...\" Freya said, then went off and stated : \"I think you're wasting your money spending seeing your family every weekend.\"\n\n\"I don't think that it's a waste.\"\n\n\"Oh but it is, think about how much you lose each week.\"\n\nMind you, I already expressed my separation anxiety to my family and my sadness in regards of living alone to her.\n\nI then said, \"Well, I don't think it is. I like seeing my family at least two times a month. I feel fresh everytime I come back from the countryside.\"\n\n\"Yeah but you should at least minimized in to once a month.\"\n\nThis irked me, I got mad and blurted out : \"I love my family, why shouldn't I see them ? I think it's worth spending a couple of euros.\"\n\nShe then repeated about the money *blah blah blah*.\n\n\"I think it's worth it because I will be feeling down all the time and it would affect my studies. Even if I'm struggling my mother supports me or I can just get a short part time job.\" I explained to her\n\n\"So you're not a strong person then,\" she said, cutting me.\n\nThat's where I became silent \u2013 so that I won't say mean things to her \u2013 and waited for her to ask to hang up.\n\n[TL;DR - My bestfriends seems like she doesn't understand me... Or am I just jumping into conclusions ?]\n\nWhy is she like this ? Does she realize that I am not her  and how I experience this are different ? I've been understanding in her situation can't se be understanding to mine ? Or I'm just being a bitch ?\n\nThank you for responding and for reading it.

I've been friends with my neighbor for almost 7 years. We are very close, our kids are BFF's etc... husbands get along... weekends we typically all hang out , its all good.  We are both on both Ends of the spectrum personality wise. She is very opinionated, difficult, headstrong etc, whereas I am just go with the flow, I don't really state my opinion, I like to keep the peace. Things were this way until hurricane Harvey. I saw a side to my friend that I did not care for. I made a comment about things I wasn't appreciating during our situations, and things completely went to hell. I learned after that situation that I can't speak my mind to her, she cannot take criticism. Lesson learned right? ok, so moving forward.. we have obviously come back to where we were before Harvey. I was hesitant to have a relationship with her again after seeing such a dark side of her, but I am a very forgiving person, and with time.. things got back to where they were. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPresent day: She takes kids to school plus mine, I pick everybody up. We help each other out when we can with the kids, why not? Why both do car rider twice a day when we can split it up?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStatement: Her kids basically live at my house. They are here ALL THE TIME. I'm fine with it. Sometimes it drives me crazy, but our kids are all besties and it is what it is. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is what I'm building at...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have asked twice in the past 3 months  for help with my boys. The last time she said ok, and then last minute ( like the day of ) said they were going to a movie and she couldn't watch them anymore. I found that shady and annoying, but luckily another friend of mine was able to help out..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked her a week ago if she could watch my boys for 2 hours for todays date bc I had a work meeting. She said ok... but then earlier today called me and said they were going to see a movie. The movie wasn't going to be over with until 15 minutes before I was supposed to be at my meeting. I told her I would find another friend to help. None of my friends could help, so I text her again to tell her I was ok with the plan of just being late to my meeting, that I would wait until they got home to leave. She then texts me AT THE TIME I was supposed to be at my meeting to let me know that the movie had just then ended. I knew and assumed it would be at least 20-30 min until they got home. I texted her not to worry about rushing home, and that I would just have to miss the meeting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSERIOUSLY WTF.... I was livid. I was also really hurt. This is someone who is supposed to be a good friend of mine. Yes we had our past conflicts, and I had my reservations, but seriously WTH? And as a mother to mother.. when you ask someone to watch your kids and you say yes... you don't flake?????? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't heard anything after the text I sent her. Not an I'm sorry, etc .. nothing...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYa'll I am so frustrated and I even cried bc I am so hurt at her actions and lack of respect/caring ( I never cry FYI ) to my husband. He says to just not help her out anymore but it also pissed at how shitty she was being. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe asked me to watch her kids twice this week after school . I told my husband I wanted to screw her over like she did me so she would get it, but I am not going to. It was just a thought, but I'm not going to do it.  I'm going to watch her kids bc I TOLD HER I WOULD, and I would never put her in a situation otherwise... but moving forward, I am not going to watch her kids anymore bc of the past 2 events when I asked her to watch mine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy whole point in this post is... what would you do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBc after the whole Harvey shitshow .. I know I can't just tell her how I fell about stuff, but that ended in completely turmoil.... yet I also don't want to keep helping her out w her kids when she screws me over royally the few times I ask her! ALSO I don't want to make things weird bc we are neighbors and God that is awkward to have issues with someone living so closely to you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nya'll.... what would you do? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nONE EXTRA thing.. to add to my frustrations..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night I told her I would make egg rolls but only if she helped me roll them. She never came over to help me roll them. When she did come over, she said that she didn't come help because I started after the Astro's game started, and Lord knows she can't miss that. So I basically fed her entire family dinner without her help.. yes that pissed me off too, and then add to todays events.. I'm pissed ya'll...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# UNDERAPPRECIATEDAF", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Also a photography and travels lover!\n\nI think I\u2019d love to meet new people that have to deal daily with any mental disorder, so we can both have an emotional support without any judgment. \n\nOr, if you play Minecraft (I\u2019m currently playing on a pixelmon server and I love it), League of legends, Overwatch or even ETS2/ATS, I\u2019d love to have someone to play with me, because I usually play alone and I\u2019m starting to find it boring a bit...\n\nOr also, if you\u2019re a Quebecer or a French speaker, feel free to message me :) \n\nBtw, I\u2019m not a good English speaker XD so if you message me, you\u2019ll need to accept that my sentences may be weird and I may do a lot of mistakes in my words lol. Also, I\u2019m mainly looking for people around my age (18-30), but I don\u2019t really care, as long as you\u2019re mature enough that works for me :) \n\nTL;DR message me if your mind is fucked like mine or if you want to play minecraft or other games with me &gt;:)", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Alt-Rock, Folk-ish, and Chill stuff is my favorite.\n\nI suppose that\u2019s all? I\u2019m pretty boring I\u2019ve realized.

She knows everything about me and I her. I love her to pieces, but I feel like this friendship has become one sided. We are both single moms. I have 1 kid and she has 2. I find myself always reaching out first to see how she's doing and to make plans to hangout. She never has time for herself because the father of her kids isn't in the picture so needless to say we don't get the chance to hangout without children (which I will admit is a bit annoying. I love her kids, but they are such a handful it's hard to not feel annoyed at times). If I don't reach out to her she doesn't reach out to me. If I call her to share something with her she is constantly talking to her kids or parents in the background while I'm trying to have a conversation with her. She does this ALL THE TIME so I don't bother calling her anymore. This weekend I purposely didn't text her to see if she'd reach out to me and of course she did not. Whenever I go to her house it's because her brother invites me over to hangout or when she invites me she ends up ignoring me the entire time or falls asleep while I'm there. I'm feeling frustrated and kind of want to end the friendship. Any suggestions? Am I being irrational?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I like to ramble on about things and my brain is so unorganized you'll probably get annoyed from me asking the same question over and over again. I know I can be cold some times when my stupid avoidant personality kicks in but if you decide to interact with me for whatever reason please do NOT take it personally!! I try my best but sometimes my best isnt good enough. I've tried making friends on discord similar to this subreddit but it never stuck cause I would get spooked and stop replying. So yeah all cards on the table there. I just dont wanna hurt anybody.\n\nInterests! Not a large anime fan but One Piece is a large exception. Hoo boy I could talk about this show for hours. When not obsessing over anime pirates, you'll usually find me watching The Office over and over again and then occasionally tuning in to Parks and Rec as well. Other shows I like are Beastars (ok well i just watched the first two episodes today but its amazing), Good Omens, House m.d. and that's all off the top of my head.\n\nI like VIDEO GAMES like Dont starve together (I have noone to starve with :,) ), Zelda, Minecraft, Hollow Knight (just got past greenpath no spoilers!!!), stardew valley, pokemon and pokemon go, the witcher 3 and again, just off the top of my head.\n\n I like cute things, especially birds.

Because of that and my anxious resting-state, I grew up avoiding social situations. I read books, drew, explored the nearby woods, gathered material for my spells, etc. Hopefully, that provides a little context.\n\nI'm overly kind, and I'll sacrifice my well-being even if it means I end up drained, hurt, unwell, whatever. All for my desire to experience belonging. If someone seems sad, I'll assume it's my fault. Annoyed? I must be annoying. I turn into a people-pleasing mess. I'll get home from work and my identity will crumble amidst the raging hurricane of insecurity and confusion.\n\nLike, even writing this out I'm fighting off thoughts that anyone who even reads this will not really care. I know that everyone suffers, that each person's situation is different, but, still, why should I get any attention at all? \n\nUnsurprisingly, I struggle with grandiose thoughts as well. I'd like to be recognized for being pretty, smart, athletic, funny, etc. When I'm stocking at work I'll quietly dance and sing to my music, hoping that someone will notice and compliment me. I feel so ridiculous even while I'm doing it. I figure I'm conflating the normal behavior of dancing to music with my anxiety about feeling awkward, which causes me to seek a fix in being praised (it would alleviate my anxiety and validate my actions).\n\nRecently, I've been having intrusive thoughts about if anyone really cares about me, even if they say to my face how much I mean to them. I spend hours dealing with these thoughts, sometimes. As a child, I'd often be able to go outside and feel immersed in nature, and I'd feel serene. Now, I don't live in that kind of area. I feel so disconnected from everything.\n\nI see a wonderful therapist and have made a lot of progress. We both have decided I need to get out more, but I feel so vulnerable. What if I get taken advantage of? How do I know people aren't just using me? How do I meet people?\n\nIt's all so exhausting. I wrote a lot, so thanks to anyone who read it.

I had spoken to other people about it to get their input and something that came up quite often was that they were maybe jealous that I was in a happy committed relationship which in part made sense as they were always critical of my relationships but whenever they spoke to my girlfriend they were always really polite and things and I didn't think that reason alone would make them drop me for one incident.\n\nSummary: Friend blocked me on everything for asking to postpone our catch up drink by an hour and I'm confused by why?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Really a roller coaster three women who came into my life like a whirlwind and just completely left me stunned. Was really kissed for the first time in my life (besides one awful incident that happened when I was 20 which I'll write about later on). But the lady who kissed me was evil, vile, horrible, disgusting just absolutely disgusting. She was even wanting to sleep with me and that's not like me at all. She made me feel like I could trust her and I did...against my better judgment. Too much to talk about really. Still shaken up by all of this. \u200b\n\n\nAnd it\u2019s like the thing is I've struggled when I was younger with pretty severe social anxiety and agoraphobia. Always more used to be by myself. I\u2019ve gone back in isolation the past few months. I really wish I wasn't like this. But it's absolutely impossible for me to trust anyone anymore. I'm 28 going to be 29 soon. I had been overweight my whole life until I was 27. 27 was when I got down to a healthy weight for the first time I lost 100 lbs since high school I'm now currently 170 lbs and I'm 6'1. But it was my whole life even when I was a kid - I don't ever remember being thin - I was always overweight. I was embarrassed by the way I looked. I knew how I looked. I knew I was repulsive. It was like having to go out in public with the most embarrassing horrible shirt on imaginable...and it's worse because it takes a year at least to get that shirt off. As a kid, I was bullied heavily heavily like you have no idea. Always ridiculed about my weight. And my dad would make me take my shirt off in front of the mirror and start to yell at me: \"You're fat you're fucking fat!\" He was an MP in the army before I was born. And that's the other thing I didn't have many friends in school and then at home I had to endure my dad and his anger issues. Very big anger issues. He was court ordered to take anger management classes. One of my first memories he put me on an ironing board and started to spank me I was in a crib, I was a baby, I couldn't even talk. I don't know he didn't hit me though but he did spank and it did hurt I was quite frightened of him and he could yell like you have no idea. And he was himself 300 lbs and 6'1 very intimidating for a kid. And it was always over something arbitrary. Years later I realize he was taking his frustrations out on me. \u200b\nSo I always just kept to myself. Never said much to anyone. I knew they wouldn't want to talk to me. That was ingrained in me since I was a kid. In high school, because I was taller and bigger, no one messed with me, they were quite intimidated by me. Everyone just left me alone. I made people uncomfortable. I felt like a monster. Kids would run away from me. I developed agoraphobia. My dad kicked me out. I was getting over my agoraphobia I was working but he still kicked me out. I had no place else to go besides this boarding house. I had a room to myself shared bathroom and kitchen with 13 drug addicts. A guy from the Aryan brotherhood used to knock on my door a lot wanting to recruit me. He scared the living shit out of me. I've been shot at. Had knives pulled on me. A 50 year old woman got me drunk for the first time when I was 20 and she took my virginity without me being aware of it. She started kissing me and it was so gross I told her to stop she gave me more beer and I realized eventually I was naked she was naked she was on top of me...she was a widow. I thought she was just really sad and I was naive when she invited me to her room. Terrible. Terrible. Anyways and the people I used to hang out with the first friends I made in years smoking weed and drinking and doing lsd the first friends I made since I was 13 - they were all drug addicts and low lifes. After one stole $600 from me, I stopped hanging out with them. I was humiliating myself for their amusement. Just because at the time I really wanted friends. I wanted to go to parties. Talk to people. People call my phone. I remember in high school always wanting to go places go to concerts but there'd be no one to go with. I was desperate at the time. Now I know better. I mean I saw a therapist for the first time when I was 22. She was the one who made me realize they were laughing at me, not with me. That I didn't deserve to be treated that way. It didn't even occur to me. I stopped talking to everyone again. I secluded myself for 3-4 years, doing nothing but drinking. Going weeks without speaking to a single person. Was becoming less desperate - I didn't want to be in a relationship after what happened with that 50 year old woman and I didn't want friends after I'd been betrayed like that. But I quit drinking. I lost the weight. Finished my degree. Moved states. Thought I'd make a new start. And I put myself out there again. And got myself even more hurt this time, more burned alive I am still shaken by what's happened to me out here. I want to leave. I'm so tired. I'm again going weeks without speaking to anyone. I haven't been drinking. I have been smoking weed since it's legal here. But I just want to disappear. Go away. Be far away from everyone else. I'm so disgusted by this species. I want to become nothing. I resent my parents sometimes for giving birth to me if I had a say in the matter I would not have been born. All I ever wanted was like a friend you know and like more supportive people but I have always been the only one there for me to push me through the difficult times, to push me through losing weight and getting sober and studying hard to get my degree. I was the only one there for me. I don't know. I'm so overwhelmed. This is what my life turned out to be. I am looking back on it, how little friends I had in school, no friends in high school middle school and then how I lived my 20s, I have gone most days without talking to a single person. I mean I'm still reticent especially meeting people in real life. I have such horrible suspicions, I can't trust anyone really. At that boarding house I've met murderers, rapists, pedophiles, you name it. And then out here where I am currently it's all awful the people are terrible. It's very difficult for me to trust because people have been quite awful to me there hasn't been much in terms of kindness. \u200b\n\n\nI substitute real human interaction with books and movies and music and feel closer to the artists I admire than I do to anyone I have ever met in real life. Kafka, Robert Walser, Anna Kavan, Clarice Lispector, Alejandra Pizarnik, Antonio Porchia, Kobo Abe, Yasunari Kawabata, Osamu Dazai, Yukio Mishima, Comte de Lautreamont, Alberto Moravia, Rene Daumal, Roger Gilbert Lecomte, Dostoevsky, Andrei Platonov, Knut Hamsun, Giacomo Leopardi, Cesare Pavese, Georg Trakl, Thomas Bernhard, Raymond Roussel, Proust, Alfred Jarry, Henri Michaux, Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Victor Hugo, Edgar Allen Poe, Mallarme, Paul Valery, Albert Camus, Luigi Nono, Pierre Schaeffer, Pierre Henry, Stockhausen, Eliane Radigue, Bernard Parmegiani, Giacinto Scelsi, Sofia Gubaidulina, Penderecki, Nick Drake, Syd Barrett, David Lynch,Kenneth Anger, Maya Deren, Jean Cocteau, Tarkovsky, Ingmar Bergman.\n\n\nI don't know what to do anymore. I'm done trying. I can't climb this mountain anymore. It is too steep. I can't get a grip on anything. I'm always falling. Every time I try to get up people always push me back down.

I started intermittent fasting about 6 months ago and it\u2019s been a game changer for the most part-I love traveling \n\nI do have a busy work schedule but would like to be able to periodically hold a convo with someone who\u2019s patient and understanding.

The first is physically demanding, because I work outside with heavy machinery in potentially dangerous situations. It is also mentally demanding because I work an overnight shift twice a week -- on the weekends -- which requires me to fix my sleep schedule every week to work the three remaining day shifts and spend eight hours alone from 10pm to 6am. With that being said, it's a great job and its exciting. It just doesn't allow for much social stimulation, especially during my work week. On the weekends, I'm usually recovering by sleeping for most of the day.\n\nThe second job is one that I do in any free time that I have. I'm an aspiring music producer, and I'd love to make that my full-time job. The problem with having a creativity-based career is that I always have to be in a creative mood, or I am at least able to get into one as a moments notice. When I spend all this time alone, though, I start to become depressed, unmotivated, and heavily-lacking inspiration.\n\nI really enjoy talking to people and I, often, find that people are my main source of inspiration. Not only would friends help with my musical ambitions, but it would also substantially improve my quality of life.\n\nI play the piano and the guitar. I loving driving and riding motorcycles. I love composing music. I can rap but producing is my passion. I like trying new things, especially if its art-related or involves going fast. I really like airplanes.

I sent her a happy birthday message a week ago and she said thank you but there was no other conversation. And it's not like we got into a fight, we just haven't spoken or seen each other in a month.\n\nA year nd a half ago I moved out of state for school, and I recently moved back home. While I was gone she started a relationship with her new boyfriend. When I got back her and I sat down and had a conversation about how we need to work to find a new dynamic for our friendship. I was still single and she was in a relationship but we wanted to make sure that our friendship was still as strong as possible. She made all these promises about how she would make sure that she made time for our friendship every once in awhile and we would hang out as a group sometimes but she never actually followed through on her end of it. She also has some deep-rooted jealousy issues because of things that have happened with past friends and relationships; and so she gets really weird any time I'm around him even in a group setting. But it seems that her solution to this problem is just choosing him over me. We've never actually explicitly talked about it but she just moved in with him and like I said we haven't spoken in a month and when we hung out before that things were just kind of weird and off. It's seems pretty obvious to me that she chose him over me so I don't know if I should make an effort to talk to her or just let it go. But part of me doesn't want to just let our friendship fall away like that, her friendship meant the world to me.

We crave the support and attention of others. But I'm starting to  believe that in some situations, that might actually be hurtful to some  of us. Those of us that need it most actually.\n\nEvery  one of us either is or knows that person that needs some help. That  individual that just can't seem to get a break. 'Poor them', we say, 'if  only this or that were to go this way or that'. if, only if.\n\nIt  isn't to say that we don't 'love' or appreciate them, rather for most,  it is confirmation of just that fact. We wish them best and hope for  their general quality of existence to improve, and in its own way, that  is laudable. But what if it turns out that this act is actually harming  them.\n\nFor most people I know, they  wear themselves comfortable. They are well socialized, responsible an  generally good to themselves. By good I mean that they tend to act in  such a way that moving forward, the decisions they have made and  subsequent actions they've taken are generally conducive to more of the  same. This seems to be the role they play. We all know that person that  is eloquent, or funny or fashionable, hell we all likely know a person  that is all that and more.\n\nWe know  this, because we remember this person as such. It isn't simply that we  have observed it in passing once or twice, rather in knowing it is  implied that we have formulated this recurrent image reinforced through  many interactions with that said person.\n\nThe  trick here is in that memory we have of that person. The memory that  generally sets the role that this person fills in our lives. The memory  that sets the expectation of what we are about to experience in our  upcoming interactions. Arguably, that is what forms familiarity and why  it is unlikely for us to be generally surprised, rather comfortably  familiar. That is the premium mediocrity of our relationships.\n\nIn a way, the memory we have of said person is the foundation of the expectation of interaction in a relationship.\n\nRosy so far, no?\n\nYou  can easily imagine how this snowballs into an aggregate effect when you  consider the cumulative memory of a group of people toward that person.  I'm sure you have all sat in groups and recalled the virtues of  another. I'm sure that statement holds for vice as well, and this is  where the tyranny begins.\n\nLet's go  back to that unfortunate friend we mentioned above. The unlucky bastard  of consequence, society, themselves or whatever the fuck. Let us  remember every interaction we have had. Every moment we have spent  listening, consoling or giving advice. Every hug, every touch or tear.  Every moment we spent capable of nothing but sitting there helpless to  their suffering, only aware that at this moment in the here and now, all  we can offer is this simple support. Let us remember when we at times  lost our patience with their misery, yet bit our tongues to hold back  saying it. Let us remember the frustration of the now normalized pain of  this individual. Let us remember them, as we have know them to be, or  believe them to have always been.\n\nAnd here is the tyranny.\n\nRemembering them.\n\nSingularly &amp; aggregately.\n\nRemembering them for whom they have been forced to be, rather than whom they can be.\n\nWe cannot remember what has not happened, and they have been everything other than what we (and they) wish they could be.\n\nThere  is no difference between this memory and that of our super-fantatstic  friend contrasted before. In the end, these are memories, rooted in  emotions expressed through interaction and reinforced through  expectation. flawed and biased to their core by virtue of the emotions  we invoked to actually remember the experience.\n\nBut the outcome is different.\n\nVery different.\n\nFor  one friend, the reinforcement is of how great they are. How  intrinsically immaculate they are. And they know it too. They know it  because they live it. And they know very well that once they express it,  it will be accepted, embraced, enjoyed and celebrated. We afford them  the possibility of forgetting that one time they were not what we recall them to be, because it is simply that, and exception.\n\nFor  the other, the same process reinforces their misery. To themselves they  must say 'woe is me, poor poor me who needs this help. Me whom they  expect to help. Me whom they expect to be miserable, even though they  wish and intend well towards me. Me who is never remembered to have been well. Me for whom the exception is to be .... well'\n\nIn  my mind, it seems that we embody the memory that those who love us most  have of us. These are the roles we accept within our closest groups,  simply to belong. One one hand, some memories raise us when we are down,  but on the other they drown us when we are about rise. What I mean to say  here is this, the interaction is far from symmetrical.\n\nIt is by this that I mean the tyranny of memory.\n\nIf  you are one of said miserable fools, then ask yourself this. Have those  around you had the privilege to remember you in any other way than how  you are right now? if they have, then you have a chance, a chance to  reformulate their memories moving forward, hard as it may be, but none  the less, hope is there.\n\nThat hope  diminishes however, if they have never seen you but as such. And while  that may seem like a death sentence, friend, I promise you it is rather  the opposite. It is actually empowering. It is now upon you to ask  yourself if the guilt of how you feel and have felt is truly and solely  the product of your singular thoughts, decisions &amp; actions.\n\nThe answer here is 'no'. A very-fucking-hard 'no' dear friend.\n\nThis  isn't a call to lay blame or fault on those around you. Rather the  opposite. they do not do this on purpose, if anything, every action they  have done towards you was likely in pure and genuine compassion.\n\nThis is the true tyranny.\n\nIt  is their good intent that has metastasized through an unsymmetrical  aggregate natural phenomena that has aided in keeping you down. If  anything, the key to improvement, minor as it may be, still lay in their  help.\n\nIt is in those around you  understanding that your path to healing involves them knowing that you  largely play a role they project on you through only what they know to  be familiar to them, the sullied memory of you enacted through you  because of every role every other person has pushed you into: The 'you'  that you are trying so very hard to not be. The potential of you that  they have yet to see. The glimmer past the dark.\n\nSo  in short, make them aware, and be aware that what needs to be done here  is an active process of reconciliation. Of memories to be overwritten,  and new stories to be told. new roles to be played, and old ones to be  forgotten.\n\nIf you have a friend or  loved one out there that is in pain, please do try to remember them as  how they'd like to be. As subjects experiencing the world in pain,  rather than objects of your compassion which inevitably oppresses them.\n\n\\-- END --", "subreddit": "friendship"}

As he is very lonely and has problems trusting others as well as feeling comfortable around others, he thought very highly of that statement. At that time I didn't know, so I just thought of that as a casual friend-making action. \n\nHe trusted me after that and he started sharing a lot about his past. For me, it is impossible to trust or feel comfortable around him immediately, because we have been knowing each other for 5 days at that time, so I didn't share much. From that onwards it has been a slightly toxic(?) friendship, with him trusting me a lot, maybe even depending on me a bit. I feel pressured because of his situation (he is lonely and doesn't have many friends), so I try my best to trust him and maybe depend on him back, but I cannot because I'm naturally an independent person and I don't really need support during this time. He also shows that he really treasure me (in a friendly way) and cares deeply about me, and I feel like an asshole for not being able to feel the same because we have been friends for such a short time how can I? Right now he is on vacation and I feel like having a break, but receiving text messages from him is another kind of pressure: he texts me saying how he miss me and how he wish I was there with him instead of his family. I tried my best to reply like I do with others, but the further he shows his feeling the less I feel anything for him. \n\nRecently I avoided him for a week, and I felt very guilty, so I said sorry to him and want to be friends again, but casual friend, but he took it the wrong way. So now even more pressure.\n\nI am stuck in this position. I want to tell him, hey, our friendship is not that deep yet for me and I wish you just care less about me and be more casual, but it sounds like a dick move. I also tried to show I care, so saying that is like a slap to him. He was very sad when I avoided him and recently one of his friend has to distance herself from him for safeguarding reasons (it was toxic), so he is even more sad now. \n\nI feel like an asshole in this whole situation. We will not see each other for 6 more days, so that is a small break for me, but I hope I could solve this before that. I cannot handle it on top of school work. I also don't want to stop being friends with him. Is there anyway this can be solved?\n\nThank you for any advice.

Because of the history I followed up a few days beforehand to see if we were still on. Big shocker; she said now she' not sure because she has something else she needs to do.

She then doubles down and tells me of another obligation she did not realize she had on this day (the day she chose). She Is the most meticulously organized type A person imaginable so there's no way she forgot or made a mistake. Literally scientifically impossible. So then she suggests another date the following week. I said I could not (but the truth is I no longer wanted to, at all). Then she asked if we should look for another date or just play thing by ear. This was via text. I don't think I responded to this. It seemed clear she sensed the rebuff and tried to scramble to save face.

We fell hard for each other pretty quickly, had a rocky first couple of months, but then everything fell into place. He and I can both confidently say that we are each other\u2019s best friends. He and I are extremely open with each other and talk about lots of things, including our relationship.\nWe moved in together in April, and have been pretty happy in our new place. We have the occasional argument but work hard to work on ourselves and support each other to follow our dreams.\nHe has said things that mean a lot to me such as, \u201cHey, when you graduate college and want to go off somewhere to play music, it would make me so so happy to see you blossom like that. And if I ever get in your way, don\u2019t let me.\u201d\nWe\u2019ve talked about moving somewhere together when I finish up school.\nWe bought a pet hamster two weeks ago.\nThree days ago we spoke about fostering a dog.\nHe is coming to meet my entire family in California for the holidays this year.\n\nTwo days ago he said to me he\u2019s not sure if this relationship; this love, is \u201cit\u201d and that he\u2019s been having this feeling of intense love for me but that he just can\u2019t see us in a future together. He also said he can\u2019t see himself too far in the future either which I suppose should have made me feel better.\nHe said he worries that he never got the experience with relationships that other people were able to have and because of that he\u2019s just not sure.\nHe has said in recent months that his sexual attraction has gone down, and I notice us hanging out more as best friends who sleep in the same bed than anything else.\n\nI basically feel like he broke up with me a couple days ago, but I tried not to let it faze me because he said he\u2019s extremely happy right now with us and wants to just keep on going and that we\u2019d keep an open dialogue.\nSo, yesterday we went to the movies, went out to dinner, and had a really great time. But this morning I was just filled with dread.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m just waiting for him to decide that he doesn\u2019t want this because there\u2019s something else out for him. Him feeling that way isn\u2019t bad by any means and I completely understand it because we\u2019re both pretty young, but is it selfish of him to have put that on me? He noticed this morning I wasn\u2019t very happy and I told him that I feel like I just need to act ignorantly happy until the day he decides he wants someone else. \nI do feel that way.\n\nI could see myself marrying this man and being with him for a long long time.\nWhat the hell do I do. I\u2019m so lost. I know he wants us both to be happy but how can I be happy when he just told me he doesn\u2019t see us in the future. That we shouldn\u2019t make any big commitments (I.e. a dog, which we had seriously been talking about a couple days ago), and I should probably keep fantasizing about the future to a minimum.\n\nAm I being unreasonable? What do I do? I need to protect my heart. There\u2019s always the chance that he does decide to stay with me forever but he is just so unsure and I feel really lost and confused.

Naturally, she was upset about it. After the horse had been up for sale for a while, a girl (M) came to try him out. They decided they were going to part loan D's horse, sharing the time with X. I thought this would make D happier because she'd be able to spend more time with X and wouldn't lose him.\n\nI thought this would make her happier, but it did not. You see,  M went to a riding stables that D didn't like. After M fell off the horse one day after riding him, D said that she wasn't surprised that she'd fallen off because of the riding stables M went to.\n\nThis was quite upsetting to me because M goes to the same riding stables as I do, so it was like she was putting me down for riding there. (I have ridden for 7 years which is longer than she has -- the only difference is that I can't afford to loan a horse like D can).\n\nShe continued to talk about the riding stables being awful and that no good riders came from there. At this point, I brought up that the riding stables was where I rode. She backtracked but after a few days, she carried on talking like this. I don't think she understands how she's upsetting me and how she's insulting me. She is determined to believe that her horse is too good for anyone else to ride apart from her.\n\nHow can I fix this? Apart from this issue with horses, D is a best friend to me and I love her. She gets moody a lot and I understand she is upset about losing her horse but I don't feel it is necessary to demean or insult a riding stables and a rider's ability. She has upset me but aside from that she is amazing and I don't want to lose her.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Even though we no longer live near each other, we still communicate quite often and I love having \"Aaron\" in my life. But I'm wondering if I should end the relationship.\n\nAaron is very generous and patient with me. if I ask a favor of him, he'll usually comply. We're quite similar--not that that's a requirement, but it definitely means we can understand each other. First few months after we became friends I confessed to having feelings for him (that was nearly 1.5 years ago) and I still do to a degree but for all we know he thinks I've moved on...I have no idea if he's aware I still like him or not. He did and undoubtedly does not feel the same about me but still wanted us to be friends back then. Time jump to this summer. After I left my shitty apartment, he let me stay with him while I finished out my job and before I moved out of my college town.\n\nHere's the problem: he can be very emotionally detached, at least where it pertains to me (our relationship is pretty 1:1 so I don't have a great understanding of how he interacts with other people). He has known time and time again I'm in a bad place and not doing very well, and he has never reached out...and while some people don't like others to get real with them, he was got real with me about shit in his own life, and has also told me a few times (though only told me recently) that I can talk to him about anything.\n\nBut when I do, he becomes distant and uncommunicative. To his credit he listens, but he truly seems unconcerned, or at the least hesitant. Again, I know some people don't deal with emotions well, but when someone is providing pretty much 0 emotional support, especially about serious things, it's hard.\n\n(examples: we were in the same college course this spring. during that time I was inebriating myself quite often which he was aware of. it wasn't until a month ago when i brought that up he said he was 'worried about me'...but then if he was why didn't he say anything before? that same night I also confessed -content warning- to having tried to kill myself at the beginning of the year...I was high on ecstasy so I was feeling pretty open when I told him this. He barely acknowledged/has acknowledged the suicide attempts, if at all. Clearly he was the wrong person to tell, and if I was in my head I wouldn't have said anything to him, but the secret had been building up. A few days before that night I tried to tell him something, began to cry, and excused myself outside where I cried alone, got high :p, and then left his apartment for hours. shortly before I finally returned he texted to ask if I was okay, to which I basically said 'I'm having a hard time. I'll be back soon'. When I retuned he barely spoke to me. These are all recent, but there are tons of examples stretching back).\n\nLike I said, he's very patient. I have an up-and-down mood/volatile and can even be abrasive and short at times, which can be difficult for others to deal with--but still he's stuck by me. He's still stuck by me even though I can be intense/sensitive/overly-apologetic/etc. Yet, I feel that I only fulfill a purpose for him. and yes, all friendships fulfill a purpose. But I feel like I could be *anyone*...I as myself don't seem important to him. It seems to me anyone could take my place.\n\nI'm not doing real well right now (obviously, haha) and deal with mental health issues and addiction, both of which he is aware of. I really try to be emotionally supportive for other people...but I don't have the energy for that to be unreciprocated. And he's not reciprocating. I've let this irritation build up for so long and I feel that it's a disservice to myself to bury it.\n\nThe reason I feel I should end the friendship is because I hate the idea of asking someone to modify their behavior. Sometimes it's necessary to tell people about the certain things they do and ask them to work on these things, and while telling my friend about why I feel hurt is probably the right thing to do, I feel it would be weird to stay his friend because then I'd want him to 'change' for my sake.\n\nSo, should I:\n\n1. I ignore my frustrations\n2. tell him and just ask that he be aware of them\n3. tell him and then inform him I don't want to be a friend anymore\n\nOr am I being too sensitive? Perhaps I'm focusing on insignificant things? I really don't think I am...If he wasn't someone I feel close to, his lack of care wouldn't bother me. But since we are close, his unconcern can upset me. I haven't clearly told him this.\n\nThank you :)", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I'm more comfortable around them than friends I make in person. This is also taking place over social media, a public space where everyone can see each other's posts.\n\nI made a close friend online in August. We didn't frequently talk because we're both in school and have opposite time zones (they're halfway across the world). We made an effort to when we could and were very comfortable with each other, play-flirting in posts and talking about our lives in dms.\n\nNote: I don't normally play-flirt unless the other party makes it clear that they are comfortable with it by initiating.\n\nI also befriended a group of people online, who are all very open and unafraid to do anything. My friend is very aware of their existence but doesn't seem to have any desire to talk to them. They play-flirt all the time in many posts and talk about anything in our group chat. I've become more comfortable with them and wish to join in.\n\nIn the past, I hinted at my friend that I might play-flirt with others in posts. They responded lowkey negative, saying that I could but they wouldn't be very comfortable doing so with me if I did. I ended up not doing so and the topic was dropped and changed there.\n\nRecently, I brought it up again because they go offline for periods of time and I wanted to connect with people my friend group knew, which involved play-flirting because why not? I directly asked if they'd be comfortable with me flirting with people in posts during their offline periods. They responded that I was free to do as I pleased, but then proceeded to say that they were no longer comfortable talking to me much and told me to take care since \"this may be the last time we talk\". I started regretting asking because they had just finished exams at school and seemed to be in a very good mood. After that they posted on their account that they were very sad, nothing else.\n\nIt was sudden, shocking and painful, so I ended up posting that I'd be taking a break from social media for the sake of mental and physical health (physical health because I've been having stomach problems recently).\n\nQuestion: Did I ask something offensive? \nAm I just being sensitive and/or rude, or are they? \nIs there any way I can restore this friendship?\n\nNote: I vented to a friend and their thoughts were that either they were really stressed out from school and used their account to cope with the stress or were just feeling jealous, but they couldn't say for sure. They also said that they probably cut me off without thinking and that if they were a true friend, they would allow proper communication.\n\nTL;DR I asked a close online friend if they were comfortable with me play-flirting in posts on social with others. They responded they wouldn't be comfortable talking to me anymore and wanted to cut ties.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

She can be a good friend (when it suits her) and we've had some great times together, but I find that now she only wants to hang out or see me when she wants something from me, whether it's free childcare, meals or other things. She's the type of person who only associates with someone when she feels there is some benefit from it.   \n\n\nLately, she's been in a 'bad patch' and I've done everything I can to support her because she's a fellow human being and I care about her. At the end of the day, I care. I've been texting her constantly to check in, staying up until the wee hours of the morning to talk her through some stuff, I've cooked for her I don't know how many times, made her hundreds of cups of tea, just anything I can to support her and show I care.   \n\n\nYet I find her very draining to be around, not because of her mental health, but because of her bitterness towards my partner and my other friends. She can get crazy jealous and 'protective' over me. She hates the idea of me having time away from her or having a relationship or other friends. She likes to laud it over me that she 'created' me. (She got me into the vintage and pinup scene) or on the odd occasion that she does help me or do things for me, she uses it against me and makes me feel like I owe.   \n\n\nI mean no disrespect to people who have depression or other mental health issues, but I feel like sometimes she lays it on to either get out of things. \"Sorry I can't help you, my depression is bad. Sorry, I didn't text or check-in I wasn't feeling it today,\" which I totally understand because we're all human and we all have human-days but some of things she says, I feel like it's degrading to people who suffer from depression or have it 'worse' than her.  (I am in no way trying to illegitimate her problems). She can also do this though when she wants something from me. Asking if I can cook or bake for her because her depression is bad and she can't cook, etc. Things like that.   \n\n\nThe bad times are starting to outweigh the good, and my own mental health is starting to suffer, as well as my relationship and other friendships. I know she is going through a rough patch and I want to be there for her, but I feel like I've done everything I can, and she doesn't appreciate it. I feel like she is abusing my kindness and charity, hence why I'm contemplating walking away. Does anyone have any advice or maybe has been in a similar situation? How did you cope with the feelings of guilt for not doing something on their terms or for taking a step back?   \n\n\nThanks in advance.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

This post is more to hear what other people think for how things are. So I met her in highschool, I was the loner most of time sitting there and just drawing when i didn't know anybody in that class, she talked to me first. She enthusiastically asked me if i liked anime, which i was drawing. Now, i didn't know that many people, I usually was just quiet and kept to myself because i was shy. I first liked the fact she even spoke to me, she was definitely my type, and she seemed really really sweet. So i left my comfort zone of keeping to myself to try to talk to this random girl who happened to be in my class. Toward the end of sophomore year i asked her out. Wasn't very smart to do it towards summer break. She asked if i could give the answer another time. i agreed... She forgot. Summer break passed and we started Junior year. I asked her if she had an answer and told me she forgot, from there i knew it was a No. It's a funny story now tho. Another two years of talking and hanging out with her only confirmed my feelings. I knew it was a long run for someone to be interested in me romantically. After highschool we both moved away, basically east coast and west coast with a 3 hour difference. We keep in touch via messages and video calls. it's been like that for 6 years, she knows and understands how i feel, but she isn't the person who wants to date people. So we're at a contradiction where, i want something. Even just a chance. (yes i know were both across the world from each other.) And she values are friendship deeply. She doesn't want to try dating me because she's afraid something will happen and ruin our friendship. I can't force her into anything because that wouldn't be fair. So i am stuck with feelings that don't seem to fade, i might just be obsessed or something, but my heart tells me its real. I understand where she's coming from, but one of my fears is that one day she'll be fed up with me, and my feelings. I don't know if i should bury my feelings and just be her best friend, or continue to try on the off chance, she gets fed up with me, which i don't think she would, but the doubt is still there. There are a lot of details i'm leaving out, because i'd have to write several pages to show everything. If i ever lost her friendship, i don't know what would happen to me. This isn't a pity story or anything. People tell me to look for other people, some say you've wasted your time, I don't think i have, even though everything has led to now, I cried a lot. I think i wouldn't be the person i am right now without all the times we spent together. I'd probably be dead if i didn't have her support. So, i'm content with how things are, even though i really want something. I shouldn't force my feelings on anyone.

We still talk a lot, almost every other day and have a lot of video calls. Its been nearly a year since Sarah left.\n\nSince then I've had about 3 instances where I've noticed Sarah  seems uncomfortable that a lot of the friends she left behind have reached out to me and become my friends too.\n\nThe most recent incident involved a girl (lets call her Angela) I met (along with Angela's family) at Sarah's wedding. Since then Angela and I have had dinner once (which I told my best friend about in advance) and a month later, Angela invited me to a dinner she was hosting with other friends, this I had not mentioned to Sarah - but not intentionally, it simply didn't cross my mind that I had to inform Sarah of this invitation.\n\nMy best friend saw my Instagram story updates about the dinner and then messages me during the dinner asking me if that was Angela's house. I reply that it was, and that it was such a beautiful house. My best friend replies saying, I've never been to her house.\n\nSarah and Angela have been friends for about 2 years.\n\nI try to steer the conversation elsewhere (given that I didn't know Angela had never invited Sarah over) however my best friend simply ignores my subsequent messages on Instagram and stops watching my stories. I message her later on Whatsapp and she ignores them too.\n\nA day later she messages me saying she wanted to talk about something that was irritating her and because of long working hours (and the time difference between her and I, I didn't manage to take her call).\n\nI'm dreading the fact she might tell me to keep my distance from Angela. Truth is its hard not having my best friend around so I felt so happy when I'd made another friend. We aren't going to become best friends overnight but I really don't want to have to let go of this new friendship before it even takes off.\n\nHow do I voice this to my best friend without betraying her feelings?\n\nThank you\n\nSummary: Best friend is annoyed I'm becoming friends with the friends she left behind when she left the country.  \n\n\nEdit: I've cleaned up grammatical errors.

One of my best friends (F) who is also my girlfriend's best friend is in a relationship with alsomeone (M) who I don't particularly like. For clarification I am also a guy so you'd expect us to get along. My girlfriend and I have discussed this a lot and it is raising concerns for my girlfriend to see her best friend to be treated badly. Firstly, he's a bad intluence, i'm not saying we don't all have bad traits but he seems to be making our friend worse after she had came out of a long term relationship before meeting him. He seems very controlling and he seems to draw the life out of her, she's very bubbly and is always up for a laugh however if he is aware of any situation he will instantly continue to influence her into thinking it's not a good idea i.e we arranged to go out to a horror night at a theme park and because he preferred to do other things...he convinced her it would be boring and she would not enjoy herself. He doesn't necessarily want to always be with her but just seems to enjoy it when she isnt having fun or speaking to her friends. Last minute he decides he wants to come (after they had a disagreement) and asked her to book tickets to 'make it up to her.' She has not been paid back for this. He uses her for a lot and she pays for a lot considering he earns his own wage yet continues to spend his money on useless shit. I can't really explain the situation but overall we cannot go out or get her by herself because she always invites him, or she won't come if we don't because he says she is not allowed. She's been hurt pretty bad by her ex partner and was even cheated on so we don't want to see her spiral again. We thought he would be good for her but since getting to know him he seems like a shit person. We want to spend time with her still but we can't seem to get through to her that she needs to be careful, they've even considered moving in together which wouldn't benefit anybody involved. We get she likes him and she thinks he is a good person but she states his flaws herself but doesn't understand.

He's not a bad guy... But he's got some very serious issues. To make a long story short, he's so far off the deep end with anime it's physically unhealthy for him. Now to be clear: everyone in our group likes anime. Some more than others. But we all have actual jobs, some in relationships, and have other hobbies and aspects of our lives. Everyone including this acquaintance are 24-27 years old. Now to paint this picture and why it's a problem:  \n  \n1) He works about 10 hours per week and spends every penny on figurines and other merch.  \n2) Very proudly shows off his room and often actively tries to. It is filled LITERALLY TO THE CEILING with anime porn/hentai stuff. I'm talking body pillows, figurines, spare bedsheets, posters every inch of the room. To top it off, it's literally the old boiler room of his parents basement. I can't be more serious.  \n3) While he is not morbidly obese by any means, he definitely has weight and hygeine issues. We've gently nudged him about this in the past for concern for his health.  \n4) He runs a fairly large, but widely inactive discord as though it's his job. Anyone who looks into the server of 4k+ people will see almost every channel is his posts, with some sparse responses from others every few months. But he spends hours per day updating his \"followers\" whenever his top-100-waifu list gets changed (about 4-5 times daily?) or he has some insight on an anime from 10 years ago. The weird part is, in person he's not shy or super unsociable. He just doesn't... Get it.  \n5) He's got real maturity issues. Back when his discord was a bit more active (a year ago) there was some anime trading card bot installed on the server. Some other member pulled a unique character he really wanted but the member wouldn't trade it away. He forcefully removed it as an admin, then got into a 6-way contest as to who was the most depressed and who had tried to commit suicide the most times. He made statements during this argument that I knew, for a fact, were false.  \n  \nYou may be wondering why I want to help this guy. At one point around 8-10 years ago, he was a really good friend. He helped me a lot when I had no friends in high school, and I KNOW he can be better than he is now. I'm well enough aware that not everyone's problems should be your own, but I think I can at least try something. Anyone have ideas?", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Shes friends with this guy, and he\u2019s a little bit suspicious, and she knows some of the things he\u2019s done we\u2019re a little rude, or weird. She even said she\u2019s beginning to hate him. But she brushes all of those things off because she says he\u2019s her best friend. \n\nThe first negative thing I\u2019ve heard about him is his horrible (online and ex) girlfriend. I have no idea how old his ex girlfriend was, but the way she wrote was horrible, very bad. It made me think she had to have been a couple years younger than him, or she\u2019s just horrible at writing. She\u2019d harass my friend, but the guy never said or did anything about it, he didn\u2019t really care. My friend was upset that the girl was treating her badly, and when I told her that the guy is a bad friend, for just letting his stupid girlfriend treat her like trash and not saying anything or defending her. But she brushes it off, because he\u2019s her best friend. \n\nThe game me and her play on has a lot of kids playing it, but it\u2019s not only a kids game. On his bio thing, he basically wrote a rape story. About a grown man raping a young girl. It was just disgusting. He wrote it in a text where it would be hard to read. But I saw what it said, and probably many others, including my friend. I sent a screenshot of it to her, and told her politely that this isn\u2019t normal. And she agreed it was weird, but brushed it off because of the same reason as before. In a game, a girl put a bed near his, and apparently that made him get all (flustered?). Now after like a day or two after breaking up with his ex (he said he broke up with her because she was annoying) he apparently likes this other girl. \n\nWhile dating his ex, he sent my friend a picture of an anime character blushing and captioned it \u201cme when you talk to me\u201d \n\nMy friend blames shyness for him ignoring me, stealing our stuff, and hitting us randomly. (Hitting lowers the health on the game) I\u2019d say hi in the chat, he\u2019d say nothing. The only time he said something is when I thought it was him who stole the important stuff. Because before he stole that stuff, he kept looking at our stuff, and he\u2019d take something. He said somebody else took it, but he was pretty much the only person by our stuff. \n\nI know 15 isn\u2019t much of an age difference, but it\u2019s just a little creepy to me. How he writes very descriptive rape stories in the game, let\u2019s people treat my friend badly, says flirty things to her when he\u2019s dating somebody, and stuff like that. But my friend just ignores these things, because she doesn\u2019t want to lose her best friend. I understand that because I used to have a friendship with some friends that I was friends with for years, but I eventually learned they were horrible friends and I shouldn\u2019t stay with them. \n\nAm I overreacting?  I feel like this guy is a little sketchy, and it scares me that she\u2019s friends with him even though he\u2019s done alot of suspicious things. Any advice would be great.\n\nEdit: I just realized the mistakes, sorry!", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I\u2019m sorry, if humanity finds a way to travel through Wormholes, I\u2019ll send y\u2019all some Konpeito\u2026hopefully it doesn\u2019t dematerialize too much and you guys get leftover flavor dust to make juice!\n\nAnyway. Hey! My name\u2019s Era and I\u2019ve had no friends since I was young(er?). Most times, when I\u2019m not at the **ABSOLUTE UNIT OF A SOUL VACUUM** that is my job, I\u2019m drawing, reading, listening to music/various podcasts, watching YT videos, anime, or cartoons, and/or playing video games. Although I mostly listen to Punk, Grudge, Metal and \u201cBubblegum music\u201d, the music taste is indiscriminate (In love with Starset, Rise Against, Three Days Grace (even after Adam left), and Beartooth, though). This goes the same for games. Time has been poured into the PC lately (Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey has been my favorite for the past few weeks). Huge love for games like Devil May Cry, Ninja Gaiden, Assassin\u2019s Creed, Metal Gear: Rising Revengeance, Legend of Zelda, Dead or Alive, Watch\\_Dogs. But, again, taste is universal. Same for YouTube (SuperMega is everything, though). Also, I love to laugh (no, no, no\u2026put the wall decals away). Seriously, why cry when I think about the work that\u2019s needed to amend poor life choices when r/holdmyfeedingtube is a thing.    \n\nAlso, every three months, after I\u2019ve finished destroying my organs with sugarcoated and salty-fried garbage and only walking to the bus stop for exercise, I go to the gym and the trainer gives me a look that makes me feel *more disappointed than my father ever could* (you the man, Dave! Burger King just *might* be a flavor mace that isn\u2019t worth the taste!)\n\nSo, erm\u2026wanna be friends?  \n\n*\\*\\*\\*I\u2019ve never done this before, and I don\u2019t know if this is required, but please reply if you\u2019re in or close in age (18 to 26). I apologize if it sounds choosy, I just feel more comfortable talking to those who are closer in age. Thank you.*  \n\n**TL; DR** \u2013 Had no friends growing up. No friends still. Gonna send some Konpeito through a Wormhole to some strangers in an alternate reality to make Japanese Crystal Light as an apology for them reading a book titled \u201cI\u2019m less shy now, let\u2019s be buds\u201d. I draw, not well, but I draw. Am fascinated with games like Devil May Cry, Ninja Gaiden, and Assassin\u2019s Creed (but, will play anything). I\u2019ve been listening to mostly Starset (**Dustin is the best boi!**) and the \u201cSkatepark Punks\u201d playlist on Spotify lately, usually I\u2019m listening to anything grunge or punk (will listen to anything, though). I love laughing (no wall decals, please. Thank you). The only way my family knows I\u2019m home is if they hear anime or cartoons on in the background. The trainer at the gym I go to knows without a shadow of a doubt that green beans makes for less mean poops\u2026oh yeah, and that I should *probably* lay off the whopper Jr.\u2019s and strawberry cheesecake if I want my heart to *actually work* in the next five years (you right, Dave!

The other, We'll call him Han, he talks to me sometimes but when I talk to him sometimes he just looks the other way. The biggest one is my boy bestfriend, we will call him Bad, bad never talks to me. I always have to talk to him, I try making conversation but he just goes to talk to another person. He used to sit by me on the bus but now he sits by his other girl friend. He's never online on Xbox and when he is, he never tries to invite me.\n\nThe reason I want to fix this quick is so I dont feel ignored on Halloween and if I get kicked out of the friend group while trick or treating. Also we have the Halloween dance this Friday, Re and Ev are going but Han was going to go but he's going to Idaho on friday. I just want to be friends again with them talking to me, I dont wanna feel left out while trick or treating either. Help.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

In junior high she moved to a different town. We still spent plenty of time together, though. We had sleepovers and I would stay over a few days at a time even. We liked all the same TV shows and always had fun together. When she got into high school she started getting really depressed and getting involved in all sorts of drama at school. She went through some really bad breakups and got increasingly depressed and withdrawn. By the end of high school we weren't as close. Then, I moved out of state for college. I didn't have much contact with her for the 2 years I was out of state. But when I moved back, I immediately contacted her to get together. Then after that a few times a year I'd reach out to her to get lunch etc.\n\nI started getting annoyed that it was always me reaching out. If I ever tagged her in anything online she wouldn't reply. When I'd suggest getting together she'd make excuses about how busy she is. And when I'd finally get her to meet me, she'd seem disinterested. Our lives had gone in different directions. She ended up dropping out of school and I was very successful in school. I had lots of exciting news to share and she didn't. \n\nAbout a year ago I decided I wasn't going to ask her to hang out anymore and that I'd leave it up to her. I was extremely busy working multiple jobs etc. anyways. But if she had asked I would've made time for her because I've always viewed her as my long time best friend. I would always tell her to keep in touch and message me if she ever needed anything. I'd suggest we see a movie or do something together other than just eating. But nothing.\n\nFast forward, I get engaged and have to move half way across the country. It all happened very quickly. I decided to invite her to my engagement/going away party to at least give her another chance to see me before I leave. And she did come. So I felt happy about that. But her enthusiasm was short lived as she shut down after the first 5 minutes of being there. I would try to engage in conversation with her but she would give one word answers. I apologized for having not seen her in about a year - I explained how I had been working multiple jobs and it had been a crazy year. I told her I'd try to send her a message once in awhile to check in. She shrugged and said, \"Meh. Most of the time I come home from work and don't want to talk to anyone anyways.\" I was shocked. I've been trying to be a good friend all these years, but she doesn't appreciate it at all. It was very rude to me. I know depressed people tend to isolate themselves, but it's just very sad to me to not want anyone to talk to. The way she said it was just so anti-social. And I am an extreme introvert as it is.\n\nI realize that we'll probably never be close friends again. But what should I do from here? I plan on inviting her to my wedding because she's known me so long. But after that what do I do? Just give up? It's very sad to me.

First of all the job lacks at least 5-6 employers so it could function properly but no one wants to work because the monthly paycheck is 400 euros. Shift are 7-14 and 14-21. I worked my ass off every day, got yelled at by customers daily because the line was alwaye long at the register bc the other register was always closed. I always stayed 30 minutes longer after my shift was done to mop the floors for the other shift. I was ready to suck it all up and it didn't get to me. The women working there come to work up to 90 minutes earlier to prepare for the shift and that part IS NOT payed. I came 15 minutes earlier to prepare for my shift. The manager there got very rude towards me so I started coming in 30 minutes eariler every day. Last week I talked to the boss and she was really nice so I promised her to come 45 minutes earlier every day (that's around 20 hours a month I will work for free btw) so I did. 3 days ago I filled up the shelves with products and the next day the boss shows me a pic of how the other girl did it more nicely than me, basically she just reorganized everything I put there with my hard fking work. I just kept silent. Yesterday they asked me to stay 1 hour longer, I stayed without a question (again, unpaid). I take 20 minute breaks. I never sit or look at my phone. I constantly work and try to contribute. But the manager kept abusing me and putting me down bc I wont be a slave and work up to 90 minutes every day UNPAID. It got to that point that this morning I came to work and they hid my chair at the register so I couldnt sit down while working. I come into her office and she has my register zoomed in on her screen as if Im some kind of a thief or something. I was so humiliated. Nothing good I did or mattered or the fact I came there to work for so little money while no one else did. I can stand all the pressure of this work but having abusive coworkers is the worst feeling in the world. So this morning I worked for 4 hours and I ask the manager to come swap with me so I can go eat something and go the the bathroom. She tells me to go the bathroom and come back (aka you cant eat now even tho its 11pm) I left to the changing room, took all my stuff and left. I feel awful right now. Nothing I did mattered only because of the fact that I didnt want to come extremely early to my shifts because I knew no one will pay me those hours. If they stood up for themselves on time, things would be different for them, and I am not a punching bag bc their life sucks. Did I do the right thing? Also, my boyfriend works in another country Mon-Fri 8-16 and makes 2500 euros. thats 8 times more than me. He didnt support me that I want to quit and he could see how bad it was for me.

{"post_id": "dmgqf5", "created_utc": 1571925257, "title": "Betrayed friend's trust with bizarre sexual acts", "author": "messedupblue", "self_text": "About 6 years ago I lived with a good friend of mine - perhaps my best friend - and did something really stupid. His then-girlfriend was also living there. No, I didn't cheat with her. I sniffed her panties and jacked off with them! I did not do this a lot, probably three or four times, but still disgusting. I also put my cock on her toothbrush, wtf. Even more stupidly, I once shared a few pictures of her on an anonymous online message board, and asked a few people if they could make fake nudes of her (I did similar with a handful of other girls around the same time). I would have justified this thinking it didn't hurt anybody and also that she was quite mean to my friend sometimes. I really despair at how I used to think - nothing could justify this behaviour.\n\nI don't have any excuses, but I suppose I would like to flag that I unfortunately carry quite bad depression/anxiety around with me and, perhaps most relevant, I have ADHD + some mild autistic traits, which means I have extremely pure impulse control, and tbh a hard time reading social norms sometimes.\n\nAnyway, this is obviously revolting and immoral behaviour and I do not engage in it anymore. It is extremely disrespectful and violating to the women in particular, as well as everyone else involved.\n\nAlthough I stopped this sort of behaviour some time ago, I have recently (for several months) felt a tremendous flush of guilt about the terrible things that I did (this is been part of a wider programme of recognition of my past failings and current behaviour and a commitment to try to be a better person for my friends, relatives, partner, and the world.) I feel that this incident was particular bad because, as well as violating the women involved, it was also betraying the trust of my best friend.\n\nSo part of me wants to tell my friend what I did. I think (but obviously cannot be 100% certain) our friendship would survive, partly because he is a good and forgiving person, partly because our friendship is otherwise so good, and partly because the incident occurred quite some time ago and he is no longer together (or even friends) with his then-girlfriend.\n\nPart of me thinks this would be the right thing to do, I guess in a similar way to how you should be honest with your romantic partner if you have cheated on them.\n\nAnother part of me feels it could be a selfish and raking up the past, making me feel less tense at the cost of causing hurt for my friend (both because of my grim violation, and also in just bringing up memories about his ex who I think he previously had to put a lot of work into getting over), who is otherwise a little isolated and depressed right now anyway. I obviously also worry that this could be the most uncomfortable and awful conversation to go through, with potentially horrible consequences for all involved, so I don't want to do it without a good reason.  I have confessed this to my girlfriend who thinks I should keep schtumm. I am perhaps too much of a coward to go through with it either way, I don't know.\n\nI can only reiterate how guilty and sorry I feel about this whole thing, how much i wish I hadn't done this, and how I will never do anything like this again (not to people close to my friends but not to anybody else either).\n\nAny advice on what to do would be really appreciated. Thank you.\n\nTL;DR. Sniffed my best friend's then-girlfriend's knickers and some other violating stuff years ago, feeling guilty and wondering if revealing all would be the right or wrong thing to do.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I consider some of my friends to be basically surrogate brothers, including the person in question.\n\nWe are all into the same assorted geeky interest. We have been there though valley's and peaks for one another school, shitty jobs, marriage, kids, careers even unexpected deaths.\n\nI'm married I have a child and know the toll that takes on a person. My total identity isn't absorbed  and isn't defined by rearing a child or being a husband, it's a big part of me but not all of me.\n\nFriend has been married for well over a decade to a woman who really isn't into his interest, and sees them more of a time sink or juvenile  interest. Her family is a group of realtor's and her main hobby apart from career advancement is keeping up with the Joneses and upgrading housing.\n\nWhen was I freshly married they were trying to get me to get a mortgage. This was in 06-07 I was working a dead end job making THE minimum wage...I said no. The housing crisis happened they got stuck underwater with some real estate. They had too cut losses and downgrade into a starter.\n\nFriend kinda starts fadeing more and more from everyone's life. We invite him to go see  movies.. always cancels last minute. We start playing magic the gathering with our cards we still have from the 90s.  We want to start around 6 PM. Friend says he can make it..he appears at 10:50PM can't leave house till kid's are asleep.\n\nFriend really is into D&amp;D likes to listen to podcasts about it, knows I'm working on forming a regular game and ask to be apart of it. I politely tell him sure however since other people are involved I need to get a assured he can meet twice a month on a Friday or Saturday for three hours I get the assurance.\n\nNext few weeks he is more animated than I see him in year's.  Calling me up and talking shop, invites me over to his place to roll some characters. His wife is with his sons watching a musical performance. Things are going well, we are having fun..his wife calls and his demeanor changes. \n\nHe starts moving about the place quick spot cleaning. He never says it but you can tell from body language and tone I need to leave. I know his wife..why would my presence be a issue. The only way to describe it is..\"I was the other woman\"  and I needed to leave now that she was enroute.\n\nThis made me feel like shit, the weekend of game everyone is at my place and we wait...and wait. He goes on black out and won't answer text or phone calls. Everyone leaves, next day he calls and says he can't do Friday/ Saturday as that's when he spends time with his kids and wife. Says late Sunday 10pm is okay, school age person is in the group and that isn't going to work.\n\nFriend hears me and buddies are playing all kinds of video games. He only has his cellphone and wife's laptop. Buddies and me band together and give him a 3DS and some games. He gives it back a few weeks later, says cellphone gaming is better for him as it's drop and go and work's better with kids.\n\nOther friends counter's that you can do the same thing on a handheld. It's speculated his wife didn't approve.  I get a call from friend month or so later..\" want to hang out?\"  Sure....I wait and wait and he calls me. I have to meet him at a 24 laundry mat it's midnight. He's washing their quilt's...we play WOW on the free Wi-Fi I had to provide both laptops. It felt...just sad.\n\n\nHe vanishes for long stretches of time.. the only time you can get ahold of him is the 15- minute drive from his work to daycare. Magically show's up for a mutual friends birthday. Buddy only wants me to have a few beers and geek out. Friend keeps turning the conversation too his career and kids. Buddy awkwardly  humor's then switched back , this switching went on for hour's.\n\n\nHe's confided in me that \"Almost all of his friends have left him\"  I feel like he wants to talk about his interest or the good ol days, gets his nostalgia and has no plans on hanging out with me or anyone. I feel used ...I'm only around when it's convenient for himself.  I would be lying if I said it doesn't hurt, the guy is like a older brother to me.\n\nOnline I see post of \"in your 30s your priorities change, especially after kids\" well..no shit but how am I able to both and have a social life as well? I've been debating in my head I'm immature, Peter pan I never fully grew up he did ?  I've looked at myself critically perhaps I'm a asshole for feeling this way. Work and home take a lot of anyone. \n\nI haven't found a good answer online this subject isnt brought up a lot with men I've seen a few thread's with ladies in kinda similar situations.

Then I move to secondary school but my school was split into 2 halves and all my friends were on the other half except John and Jake. I then found a new circle of friends so me, Jake and john all hung out with them. Only problem was, suddenly jake was a huge nerd and was really weird, like to be funny he would randomly say \u201cavocados\u201d or something. This made nobody like him that much so every day he would come over to me and chat. He always talks about history now and it\u2019s really boring, also hanging out with him makes everyone think I\u2019m weird.

Not because it was ordained by any external creed, internal insecurity, or lack of option, but because it was their informed-choice to do so; their way of demonstrating that future devotion. I still believe in such a person. \n\nHowever, it seems the only other people who follow a similar-model to myself are those who do so due to religious-practice (I'm agnostic), those who have issues with intimacy (been to therapists; they say that isn't the case) or those simply haven't had the opportunity to get intimate with another (I've had offers). \n\nI'm here to see if there is some sort of community for people like me, or others who might feel the same way I do (i.e. reserving physical intimacy due to non-religious values). \n\nNot really here to get into a debate; just trying to find other people like myself.

I've been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts for about 4 years now, recently its started getting much worse and I've been trying to push it back with thoughts of \"just bold out\" \"it'll get better\" \"think of your future\" but I've just started realizing things. Like currently I'm bombing school. In my 12th year, with less than half of my required credits for graduation, absolutely no motivation to fix that, fucked up sleep schedule so I wake up halfway through the school day either way, I have no plans for anything after HS like college or uni, and no interests other than self indulgence. About this time last year my ex who I think I can safely say is the one and only person I've loved broke up with me. After her I've never been able to feel any emotional attachment to people, at first I didnt realise it until earlier this year. Since her I've done nothing but hurt and lead people on. It makes me feel like shit but there's nothing I can do about it. I want nothing more than to have somebody but I cant brig myself to feel anything for anybody. I can see a great person or a gorgeous person etc but I just dont feel anything. On top of all that there was always this feeling in my life of \"the end\". I never noticed it too much but as i got older i started noticing it more. Everyone has a sense of their future but for me it doesnt go that far. It's just been getting closer and closer and now i feel like I'm brushing it. I have no idea what will happen when i hit it, but it terrifies me. I dont want to be a failure, I dont want to be a fuck up, but I see mo other options. All I can think about lately is killing myself to escape it but I constantly think about what it would do my family if I were to do that. I dont want to leave that kind of burden behind. I very rarely cry and tonight is the first time I cried in months, as I'm writing this lol. I feel like an absolute monster unable to care for people who I should care about and constantly hurting them. I've truly begun embracing my sins lately and I hate it but its who I am and it's what keeps me going. I constantly feel like I'm trapped and I have this weight onto of me and I feel so fucking alone. All I want sometimes is a fucking hug. I know it's not much but at this point that would mean the world to me, yet if someone were to offer me one in person I'd turn it down cus I'm a stuck up asshole. I'm sorry if this makes no sense and I know it's very patchy and mixed up but I just typed everything as it came to my head.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I have a friend who messages me CONSTANTLY, who I have told on multiple occasions I may not be able to answer right away. I try to answer at least 3-4 times a day. I try to be better about it genuinely but (1) I\u2019m in law school. I\u2019m in class/clinic from 7am -7pm , I come home make myself dinner, shower, and do homework until I fall asleep. I am planning my wedding, and I work two jobs on top of it all. I have an exam once every other week , and I\u2019m writing my law school thesis this semester. I hate when people say they\u2019re \u201ctoo busy\u201d but I genuinely am and I often see a message, tell myself \u201cI\u2019ll answer once I get out of class, finish this reading, writing this page, etc.\u201d and just plainly forget because there\u2019s just so much my mind is trying to keep track of at this point. (2) it\u2019s really hard to keep up a conversation. Anything I write, the response is \u201cok\u201d. My friends often gets mad at me for taking too long  to respond, and for letting \u201cconversations and our friendship die\u201d but I genuinely have in the past been trying to foster conversations but how do you continue conversations with anything you say being responded with \u201cok\u201d. My friend has a crush on me and all my friend is interested in talking about is how in love they are with me and how much they want to have sex with me (despite that I\u2019m engaged to someone I\u2019ve dated for a decade and I\u2019ve known this friend since right before law school). \n\nEvery few weeks we get into arguments about how I\u2019m a shitty friend that has no interest in continuing the friendship, who is abandoning and doesn\u2019t care just like everyone in their life, and who that in a liar when I say I genuinely do care but I\u2019m just struggling to keep up with my life right now. I mean I hardly even talk to the friends that will be in my wedding party at this point and my maid of honor is in law school with me and the only contact we have at this point is a wave upon passing each other on the way to classes. So it\u2019s also not like I\u2019m going out of my way to ignore my friend either. \n\nI genuinely don\u2019t know what to do at this point but I\u2019m sick of dealing with the hostileness and passive aggressive behavior at least once a month at this point and being told I\u2019m shit even though I\u2019ve been trying my best to make a point to answer at least a handful of times every day . \n\nI mean am I in the wrong here? I genuinely regard this person as a close friend who has always been here for me and when he is having problems I make it a point to respond almost immediately. I just don\u2019t know what to do with this person anymore", "subreddit": "friendship"}

We've been friends for 4 years, and in the past year and a half I've found it harder and harder to tolerate her. She's an extremely superficial person, extremely fake and obsessed with appearance. For years, she's made fun of me or made negative comments about my weight, my clothes, what i eat, anything related to my appearance, and I'm starting to get sick of this behaviour and I want out.\n\nPart of the problem, though, is that Ariana has suffered from anorexia in the past so I do have a small amount of empathy in that regard, but I just can't go on like this because in the 4 years we've been friends she's damaged my self esteem severely.\n\nAnother problem is that my group at school consists of around 18 girls, and although almost no one likes her for aforementioned reasons (she's made similar comments to others, but I'm her main target) I don't want to disturb the peace in the group. One of my friends tried to end the friendship since she was moving schools and this resulted in Ariana having a huge breakdown, calling my friend 'fake' for trying to be civil with her for the sake of the group.\n\nThird problem is that she's gotten better at hiding her borderline bullying over the years, so while taken absolutely literally her comments might sound harmless, but it's obvious to everyone around her that they're meant to be jabs at my body image. So in that respect I can't end the friendship based on one of her comments, because she'd say I'm overreacting.\n\nFourth problem is that I still have to interact with her semi-regularly. She joined my maths tutoring group recently and we obviously sit in the same group at school, so that's going to be a tad awkward if I suddenly say that I don't want to speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyways thanks in advance for your advice \\^v\\^\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \nI forgot to mention the ABSOLUTE WORST thing she ever did: when I was 14, I had a crush on the above friend who tried to end the friendship with Ariana. I told Ariana in confidence. Additionally, said friend started dating another one of my friends, and they wanted to keep it secret. So of course what Ariana did was tell EVERYONE what happened, outing me WAY before I was ready (I'm nearly 17 and still not ready) and exposing my first, unrequited crush to the entire world, while causing said friend and her girlfriend extreme anxiety which ended their relationship. I confronted her about this but she denied having said anything (not true - I asked people how they knew and, of course, they said Ariana had told them). I don't mean to dramatise it but seeing as I was already heartbroken over the girl I was borderline in love with happily enter a relationship right after she found out my feelings, having everyone know about something that should have been private forever absolutely broke me. I fell into a 1.5 year depression after these events and while I can't solely blame it on Ariana she played a big part in ruining that time of my life. Once again I know this is dramatic but it almost drove me to suicide, and honestly while I'm mostly better due to a lot of mental strength the insecurity she's left me with due to what she did, along with her comments about my appearance, still haunt me today, which is why I feel I need to cut her out of my life.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I'm not looking for someone to vent to, I'm simply looking for a friend that  is supportive in terms of motivation, I can also do the same back. I've always been the motivator in my friendships but never had the same for myself and I'm in a place where I could kind of use it right now.\n\nFor a little context, I have been raised in a toxic environment but I don't wish to go into details about that. A few years ago I did move out but certain events happened and my mental health took a tumble. I'm currently in a position where I'm going back to full time work which means I will be saving to move out again in 4-5 months. I could really do with a healthy friendship to keep my motivation going high on the low days as this place can be pretty draining on the best of days.\n\nAs for my personality I'm quite a simple person, I prefer to focus on the small things in life as I don't have much care for anything bigger. I believe life is so fleeting in the grand scheme of things and I really don't want to miss all the small details this universe has to offer us if we just sit back and allow ourselves to take it in. Ironically I also play a lot of video games, gotta have balance right? I listen to all genres of music, although I mostly listen to reggae, gotta keep them positive vibes going. I don't mind speaking about topics such as politics etc but I would rather not, it all seems pretty childish to me (politicians that is). I'm a big food lover, although I don't each much variety, just quantity. I love PC related technology and actually built my first ever PC a few months ago, that was pretty stressful but I did it!\n\nAs for you, as long as you also want a healthy and supportive friendship then I say we should try talking. Having hobbies etc that line up aren't a necessity for me as learning new things and gaining new experiences is what make friendships valuable.

I moved to Chicagoland around a month ago from Iowa. I\u2019ve bounced around the US the past 10 years; lived in San Diego, Indianapolis, Fort Worth, Annapolis, Iowa, and Chicago. However, I\u2019m originally from Chicago/Illinois, and I am settling down here again. I\u2019ve lost contact with most of the people I used to talk to and chill with; marrying, moving and raising kids was priority. I\u2019m hoping to find some form of that again, even if it\u2019s virtual, in an effort to regain some personal connection with the world outside my home/work (I work alone in a clinic, so no help there).\n\nSome facts about me that I consider important:\n\nI am an avid gamer in my free time, but my game preference is eclectic and not necessarily all mainstream. My main source of gaming entertainment the past 3-4 years and going back to my high school days is/was classic World of Warcraft. I currently play with one of my partners/mother of my daughter, but it\u2019s more of a casual thing for us; I play more seriously solo. Hoping to find more people to play with.\n\nSpeaking of partners, I (was/am/it\u2019s confusing) polyamorous/non-monogamous. I live with my wife and two boys, but I also am coupled with another partner whom we previously lived with and now is living with family in Maryland. I have a daughter with her whom I love/support/visit a lot. I\u2019m not looking for more relationship partners, and I\u2019ve drifted away/grown past the non-monogamous lifestyle that I subjected myself to. But I still love my little family a lot and I try to be there for the people I love. Hopefully, there\u2019s somebody out there willing to understand that aspect of my life.\n\nI have/do collect arcade gaming memorabilia. My family had an arcade/pool hall growing up and there is an emotional connection to that hobby. I just had to offload all my collection in the past 2 years between moving cross-country twice and downsizing, but I still consider myself an avid collector. Pool tables, pinball machines, SEGA NAOMI satellite systems, cabinet games etc. I actually went back to school for computer programming and mathematics because I wanted to set myself up for a career programming gaming machines in casinos and arcades. I finished up the math minor, but I learned the programming was above my mental capacity at 29 with other responsibilities.\n\nLeading to my last fact, I\u2019m a sound technician/engineer by trade. I work mainly with hearing devices, but I have experience with live sound and recording in the music sector. I am hard of hearing and do wear hearing aids, but I don\u2019t let that define me. I just say \u201cWhat?\u201d a lot :)\n\nAnyways, I\u2019m hoping there\u2019s someone/few that take the time to read this and say \u201chey, that guy is pretty neat\u201d and feel compelled to respond. I don\u2019t really care if we share a ton of the same background/interest, as there are a ton of interests and history that I didn\u2019t get into in the few paragraphs posted. I just ask that you are interested in carrying a conversation on and like to talk.\n\nThanks everyone!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

So there's almost always someone to talk to.\n\nAnd like I said there are a ton of features built into the server you can chose to you or not at your own pace.\n\n-----------------------\n\nLike: \n\n- Discord Games like; Blackjack / Roulette / Slot Machines\n\n- Our own server economy that we use for various things including giveaways.\n\n- Pet Pics and Photo Gallery's from all over the world\n\n- Pokemon to catch and play with in their own channel.\n\n- Various game sections that we are always adding to like Destiny 2 and Warframe and a few others.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd soon I will be starting my own personal giveaways through the channel and I'm currently looking into what I need to have setup so we can have server wide movie nights as well &lt;3\n\nNeedless to say there are a ton of things in this server. Not all of which you have to participate in. But at the core of that server is an amazing and supportive group of people from all walks of life helping and building one another up &lt;3 It's really turned into an awesome place.\n\nSo if you are looking for somewhere to play games while you're bored, people to talk to, or just want to post the dankest of memes. We take all kinds &lt;3 So swing by and see what we have to offer &lt;3", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

It doesn't matter what it is, be it love, friendship, or a discord community .\"Sic Parvis Magna\" - Greatness from small beginnings. This discord intends to stay smaller (think: 30-40 people) with an emphasis on building long lasting relationships with people who are not only like-minded, but share an interest in genuinely connecting over time. If you're just passing through, this discord won't be ideal for you. We cannot promise you will meet girls/guys here who you will click with if that's also what you're looking for. Hopefully you're somebody who wants to make real friends, eventually meet up, talk everyday, etc. all that stuff.\n\nThe current members of the discord are from another discord, we know each other very well. What does this mean for you? Well, it means not only do we have this type of experience, but we will also do our best to connect with you. This means if you're a shy type, we don't care. Extrovert? Great, you'll fit right in. Some of us play games, some do not, this is definitely not that type of discord. Since we're talking about creating connections with people, we do expect you to be not only real, honest, but we hope that you are willing to voice as well. Why? Real connections occur when real effort is put out. Text is great, and often times we can only text, but we want to get to know you. Talking over voice is a good way to do this, and I believe that it's the only way to get really close to somebody.\n\nThis discord is very small currently, you will be here at the beginning (and hopefully) for a long time. If you're looking for a very active discord, this is not that currently, though eventually it will be. If you're looking for good friends, chattin shit, banter and finding people long term to talk to, meet, etc, this is for you. Some things about the people in here: We banter, a lot. We make dark jokes, we typically don't view things as sacred bar certain topics, we definitely expect you not to bully people, and we expect you to put actual effort in to creating connections as it's the whole point of this discord. Ideally you are: Genuine, can banter, will not disappear (if we see a lack of effort we will simply remove you.), would like to voice, not an internet personality, etc.\n\nplease PM me if you're interested, thanks.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Unfortunately it didn\u2019t stop me from becoming an alcoholic, and I finally hit bottom earlier this year and went to treatment. My alcoholism is apparently unforgivable to my wife, who left me and is completely unwilling to reconcile. I\u2019m hurting worse than I ever thought I could. The more I reach out to her the more hostility she responds to me. I lost my license, my job, and through the divorce I\u2019ll lose the love of my life and my home. Recovery and treatment taught me that alcoholism is a disease, and that I didn\u2019t choose to behave badly when it was at its worst, but my wife and other friends and family don\u2019t look at it as a disease but as a moral failing, and that I choose to drink. I\u2019m mixed up and torn up and am genuinely kind hearted. The worst I did was argue with my wife. I don\u2019t believe I would have stopped supporting her had she gone through what I have. I\u2019m scared and could really use a friend. Thank you for reading.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I had actually been okay (with minor sad feelings about it through the 6 months )with it until I recently saw on Snapchat that they all gathered for one of the group members birthday. It hurt my feelings a lot because I thought back on how much I cared for all of them. I knew they treated me different from the beginning because I wasn\u2019t as wild or as into the night life as they were. I was a timid voice but I still contributed. I knew they had a separate group chat where they excluded me  during our friendship time but I still was optimistic and believed they had their reasons. Im currently trying to figure out if maybe I was boring to them and maybe how much I cared was too much because it hurts a lot right now.

At first I was reluctant to ask people to hang out because I was really nervous to be rejected, the person I\u2019m with (who\u2019s really far away) said that it\u2019s cus of my ego and I should get over that and put myself out there. Fine. That made sense. Thing is, I did put myself out there, again and again, I ask people to hang out and they always make some sort of excuse. The very few times I have gotten anyone to hang out is cus I\u2019m face to face and they ask if I want to tag along. It\u2019s just so fucking defeating and honestly, embarrassing. The college I wanted to go to didn\u2019t work out and I went through a rough time dealing with that and I thought at the very least if I came here I\u2019d have a fun time, and that doesn\u2019t seem to be happening either. I don\u2019t know it just feels so defeating honestly, I know this sounds like I\u2019m just complaining and I\u2019m lucky to even have been able to go to college but it\u2019s really been bumming me out and needed to let it out if I\u2019m honest.

Absolutely my favourite hobby.\n\nFitness - massively into gym, have done martial arts too\n\nTV - my fav TV shows are Breaking Bad and Death Note. I enjoy anime, not my fav thing, but it's good. Black Mirror, Titans, B99, all excellent TV shows\n\nCulture- actually went to Hyper Japan for example, really was nice to appreciate another culture and history.

I myself isn't Nazi and I never support both of Nazism and Antifa because I detest those herd instinct. The ideology of Nazism fascinates me only because it tells me the deepest abyss of mankind.

It may not sound like a long time, but we've been through a lot together and share similar interests to the point that it seems like we're the same person. At the same time, however, we're also very different in certain ways, which leads us to clash sometimes...and our arguments are usually about stupid things. (I think it's important to note that our arguments only occur over text, so there may be a miscommunication issue.) Like today, for example, I jokingly remarked on how I found Prince Eric from The Little Mermaid attractive and also told her that Ariel was my favorite Disney princess growing up. She agreed...and then proceeded to say that Prince Eric was sexist and that Ariel was a horrible role model for girls. She is a lot more political than I am and explained that she can be argumentative sometimes because she doesn't have many outlets for her competitive nature (which sounds like an excuse to me). While I understand her perspective, I highly disliked how a lighthearted conversation had to turn into a debate that she had to win. My mistake was probably when I tried to defend the movie and its characters on the basis of nostalgia, but I was riled even further when she dismissed me and listed various Disney princesses that she thought were \"better\" and \"superior\".\n\nRidiculous, right? Another time, we argued over some random guy who was posting troll comments on her Instagram account. I thought it was cringey of her to write out long-winded and aggressive responses to him, but she implied that I was too passive and that she roasted the guy successfully. Another time, she wanted to watch 16 Candles with me for her birthday (which I consider to be problematic because of their depiction of Asian stereotypes), but she refused to watch Kiki's Delivery Service with me because it was anime (I'm not sure if Studio Ghibli counts as part of that genre) and assumed that it would be Japanese porn/hentai. The list goes on and on. These kinds of arguments drain me to the point of exhaustion and I don't know what it is that I do to cause them. My friend has PTSD and explained to me that certain words trigger her, so when I say certain words to her, she gets very emotional and that's what causes her to lash out at me. I'm not a trauma expert, so while I do want to be considerate of her, it feels as if I have to walk on eggshells around her while she can just take out her \"excess aggression\" on me. I also have an issue with certain things she does. She promotes herself as a strong feminist and that she doesn't need a man to sweep her off her feet, yet she constantly finds new boys to crush on and often talks about how attractive they are, how she wants to flirt with them, etc.\n\nThis is getting way too long...Anyways, besides these petty fights that we have, we have so much fun together when we hang out in person and we're always sad to leave each other. I've thought about whether she could be a toxic friend. I've done so much for her and she's grateful for it, but she seems quick to forget all of it when we fight and accuses me of being a bad friend when she gets really emotional. I'd avoid communicating with her technologically if I could, but we live far from each other and I'm one of her closest friends. Whenever I feel like holding what I've done for her over her head, I try to remind myself that that is extremely selfish and manipulative, especially since she's experienced a lot more adversity than me. Still, it does feel like a burden to text her sometimes because I have this fear ingrained in me that anything we talk about could turn into a fight.\n\nHas anyone had a similar experience to mine? If so, do you have any advice for someone like me who is really bad at handling conflict to the point of physical and mental exhaustion? Is it worth it to stay friends with someone who I'm fighting with at least twice a month? Any and all responses are much appreciated. :)", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I enjoy cooking and baking and trying out new recipes. The outdoors is one of my favorite places. I like hiking or walking near the lake on cool fall afternoons. I like travelling and lived aboard for a while. I like learning new languages, I have basic-intermediate knowledge in one or two.\n\nThat's all I can think of for right now but it's a good starting point. I'm 26(female/mixed-race if it matters)and I work as a receptionist at a clinic, so I have a reasonable amount of down time. I like people with a sense of humor because I know I can be childish sometimes. Can't be a serious adult all the time. Everyone is welcomed, genders or orientations don't matter. I'm just looking for a friend or two, nothing creepy or romantic. If you think we'll get along or have something in common then message me! Please be 20+", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I\u2019m extroverted and a definite social butterfly. In parties or general gatherings I go around talking to just about anybody animatedly with no hesitance.

I suspect those issues are because I have ADHD. Otherwise I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m a good friend? Yet none of my friendships have ever lasted for very long. For some reason the longest friendships I\u2019m able to maintain are a year or two at most. After that, if by some miracle I keep contact with the other person, the relationship is devastatingly hollow and flimsy and just wrong? Afterwards any interactions with the other party are mostly out of obligation than anything else. \n\nNot many people really understand why this is bad. Hell if somebody asked me to rattle off how many friends I had just a few years ago I could name almost a hundred people. But if you asked me how many of those \u201cfriends\u201d would still be around the next year I couldn\u2019t answer with even one of them. It\u2019s honestly exhausting constantly trying to find new friends to replace the old ones so I don\u2019t mentally sink.\n\nNot only that but, even if I have friends, it really does hurt because I need a real friend. A genuine connection with just one person\u2014 that\u2019s all I ask, one person who doesn\u2019t abandon me. \nI want someone who\u2019s shoulder I can cry on, not someone who always crying on my shoulder and using me as a vent bucket and then never returning the favour. \nI want someone who I can lean on when I\u2019m in a time of need, not just some lazy half hearted texts wishing me to get better soon from some fair weather-friends while I\u2019m in the hospital.\nI want someone who actually wants to be in my life, through the thick and thin, not someone who stays by my side merely because they know they can use and abuse me.\n\nJust because I\u2019ve given up on having a ridiculous amount of friends now doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ve given up on having friends in general. I won\u2019t stop trying. Although I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t hesitant about reaching out to new people. These last few months my personality has really changed. I\u2019ve become quiet and introverted and just isolated\u2014 which is the total opposite of who I\u2019ve almost always been (I\u2019m known for being: loud, eccentric, and happy). My experiences with friendships have been bad, most of them traumatizing, and I\u2019m not sure if I can take much more with the rate my mental health is deteriorating. The only comfort I\u2019ve had is the reoccurring thought of: \u201cwell, I can\u2019t get worse emotionally.\u201d I know that thought alone is a form of denial (yes, I know it can get worse emotionally, but please let me claim otherwise) but it helps me so I let myself think it during stressful situations. Recently I told my parents I\u2019m depressed. There\u2019s more to it than this but my lack of friends is the largest contributing factor. My mom thinks if she just hangs out with me every Sunday it\u2019ll start getting better\u2014 unsurprisingly it hasn\u2019t. My dad believes that if he drowns me in work I won\u2019t be able to think about my depression (at least that\u2019s the impression I get from him, so these are my words, not his). The only reason he got me to go along with any of it was with the promise that these opportunities would allow me to meet new people, which means new friends. \n\nI know I\u2019m doing something wrong. I struggle to honestly believe that I\u2019m not doing something that pushes people away but I can\u2019t figure out what that is. So, I\u2019m here. Please if anybody can tell me what I\u2019m doing wrong I want to improve. I just really want some real friends and I\u2019m willing to go through a lot for that. Besides that if there\u2019s just any advice anybody could offer on my situation then my god would it be appreciated.

Our interactions with each other has been dull and repetitive. Whenever we hang out together, it is usually at a place she wants to go to eat/drink, and the topics we discuss about is usually her guy drama with the guy friends and interests that she sees or have seen, and about people in general, or her obsessing over her dog. I also feel kind of disrespected for whenever she reacts to certain things she disagrees with on my hobbies and interests lately, when I have never really done anything to shame hers. I've begun to realize that there has been little opportunity for when there is any interest of where I wish to go to; and whenever I get a chance to speak about whatever is on my mind, she has been cutting me off or not really listening/not interested in what I have to say. I'm also getting tired of the typical stories and drama she talks about with the guys she dates or sees as friends, as if there is nothing else better to talk about. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDue to the repetition of things and the way she has been making me feel, I've with-drawn from saying much more often now, and just listen as I usually do.

However I actually don't have much to say since I rarely know the guys/people that she talks about majority of the time, but will do so if absolutely necessary. I'd rather just hear her out and let her talk since she apparently needs the outlet. Only based on the reactions I get for whenever I attempt to talk about other topics and making other suggestions, it has made me hesitant and suppress the confrontation of my feelings about this.

I was homeschooled all my life and my parents jobs had us moving every few years, so I never had really good friends or anything. My parents also are the awkward, shy, but not that emotional type. Now I am a 26 year old female with a career and husband. I have a few people I kinda talk to at work, and I joined a adult soccer league and made some friends. But I'm still super awkward, have social anxiety, and I dont get invited to a lot of things. I know in odd, and not great at small talk, but I try and try and try again. I would love if someone could be my mentor or something. My husband is also not great with friends and things, and well my family was raised the same as me. \n\nI want to ask about a few things, for example:\n1. When they are making plans in front of me and everyone is already invited other than me, but otherwise conversation is fine, should I ask to go or just stay silent and hope for an invitation in the future? (This happens a lot. The ladies have been friends mostly for a really long time, and then me. Things they've planned while I was right there:beach trip, lunch, girls night, Halloween party, etc) I never say anything about it. Sometimes I do get invited, but I know I'm awkward and weird. \n\n2. They all seem to like me, they say they like me. But my husband tries to be supportive by coming to most of my soccer games (my family wont come, and a lot of the other ladies have family and stuff that come.) and sometimes comes to other events like a concert we went to. It seems like he is there a lot, and their guys arnt? Does that possibly effect whether I am invited? \n\n3. Sometimes it seems like they are kinda avoiding the truth or speaking around a subject instead of just telling me what they are planning. If they dont want to invite me it is ok, especially when I know two of them were invited to a third friend's (who I dont know well at all) party and stuff. Is it acceptable to ever just ask if they like me (which they do, occasionally they text me first etc!) but dont always want to hang with me or something? Is it ok if I ask if their is anything I can work on to be a better friend? \n\n4. This one lady is like me, though has been friends with them for years now. She does randomly text me and things, and invites me to a lot of things. We are both the awkward, quiet, not many \"great\" friends type. How do I hold onto that? Should I get her something for Christmas? Can I ask her questions without her feeling like I'm a burden? \n\n\nClearly I need help. Finally, at age 25, I found some friends.

And the entire time I thought it was because I was the freak show of the grade. He told me to talk to him anytime I\u2019m bored since he grew up lonely and isolated from racism, so he likes having someone to talk to. I don\u2019t know how it happened but I\u2019ve been messaging him everyday since early this year now. He wanted to be more than just texting buddies and actually hang out as friends. I never wanted to actually hang out in person, but sometimes all the cute talk and flirty messages makes me actually considers it. My childhood let\u2019s say social anxiety makes me scared to otherwise. \n\nUpdate: He's not exactly a looker that cute/hot ... so alot of girls dont actually consider dating him. And from the sounds of it he's become head over heels for me. I've been pushed into sexual things which ended up in lets say kinky messages, and now im not even shy about it anymore. idk how it happened. At one point he sent me a pic on lady in a G string asked if this is the kind id wear. the first thing I asked was WHY DO U FOLLOW THESE ACCOUNTS, and he goes to help make me feel sexy Update 2: he sent me some bikini model twerking at one point, twice.   At one point some chick sitting at a table\nCovering her boobs. And excitedly sent to me Booobssss.   Then I told him don\u2019t ever send me these disgusting things ever again. His response was that the booby lady was famous.    Seems to have been a youtube person.  She not famous to me she\u2019s just YouTube popular. I told him I didn\u2019t care and the chick looks like she wouldn\u2019t get along with me, and he said to me \u201cokay okay\u201d all apologetically. Then for some reason I blocked the YouTuber after her page popped up from someone else\u2019s activity. I don\u2019t know why she made me mad. Like she had this bitch face I didn\u2019t want to see again.     A lot of the time the things this guy does just irritates me for no reason even though he\u2019s super nice. He admitted he annoys a lot of people and its fine.   alot of the time we act like a pretend couple when we message. Update 3: im not even actuallyy his girlfriend, but I get very angry over knowing he follows so many inappropriate accounts. I dont know why. and even when he ignores me, all because he was in the bathroom or out with his cousins. Why do I keep feeling like this. \n\nI know he isn\u2019t a red flag that just wants sex. He\u2019s a virgin that doesn\u2019t want intercourse until marriage because of his fear of catching any STDs. Same to be honest.   He\u2019s just sexually open with friends.  But he\u2019s dirty af. I don\u2019t like the accounts he follows. He\u2019s been educating me about being careful with guys, and all these wild people he\u2019s known and talks to (the sexually active freaks - all these girls that have open conversations with him about their sex lives. Wtf). \n\n\nnonetheless im too scared to actually hang out with him. Yet I like talking to him and all the attention he gives me. Should I at least hang out with him once to see if I like him? Why do you think I keep getting angry with him over text??? Update 4: I've never been in a relationship, or knew people actually found me pretty.

Nonetheless he's a nice guy that wants me to study, and even learn how to cook, and not sleep all day. we act like a pretend bf and gf. how did this even happen? why do I enjoy the cute messaging?? do I like his personality? should I actually give him a chance to actually hang out in person? why am I like this", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

This isn\u2019t because I\u2019m disliked, neither is it anything to do with my personality, it\u2019s just how history has written itself.\n\nI have many friends online who live not too far away and have been to see them but it\u2019s not very practical.\n\nIt obviously isn\u2019t very attractive to have a guy who doesn\u2019t go out with a group of lads now and then so a girlfriend is off the cards until the \u201cone\u201d comes along\n\nHas anyone else experienced a total lack of friends? How to do you deal with the loneliness? \n\nSo much for keeping it short! Sorry!", "subreddit": "friendship"}

On Friday we and a lot of our friends attended a halloween party, basically an excuse for a bunch of teenagers to get super, SUPER drunk. I suffer from a anxiety disorder so it was no surprise that i wasn\u2019t having the best time, my remedy for this; to get drunk. i had never been drunk prior to this night but everything seemed to be fine. Cue my best friend pulling me and my other friend to one side. drunkenly explaining to me and her that she wanted to tell us a big secret; that she was in fact bisexual. We were both thrilled for her telling us and she already knew i was also bi (had been out for 3 years) so she trusted us with this secret. She also revealed that last party she went to, she tried making out with one of my other close friends who is straight, obviously getting denied musn\u2019t have been the best experience for her but she didn\u2019t seem sad about it at all, she found it quite funny. So the party goes on, more shots and getting more drunk. I find myself going outside for a bit of fresh air, finding my friend out there as well, laughing away at herself as drunk people do. Now i hadn\u2019t really been in any relationship for ages and neither has she, so i go up to her and get pulled into a hug. She tells me that she wants to make out but she had never done it with a girl before, so i ask if she wants to kiss me (we were both drunk so it probably wasn\u2019t exactly those words) so she agrees and we both go in. So we stop and she keeps mentioning that she had never done this before and that she didn\u2019t want to pressure me into doing anything, i say that i want to and she isn\u2019t forcing me to do anything i didn\u2019t want to. so this happens a couple of times in the night, moving around and about the same things happen, i stop when she tells me stop and it seems like she really enjoyed it, after me asking her if she liked it and us laughing about it together. So i thought everything was hunky dory. Until my other friend who she came out to starts to interfere, she separates us and tells me that my best friend told her to stop her from kissing anyone and causing herself embarrassment. I thought she was enjoying herself but maybe i was just imagining that, but she did let me kiss her multiple times willingly throughout the night with no sign of discomfort, she was laughing and smiling and so was i. So obviously i start to panic, i think that she hates me and was just kissing me because she felt like she had to and that i messed it all up. We end up walking her home because she asks us to after a couple of hours after the whole interference. I feel super awkward but i dont want to bring it up with her because im scared that she won\u2019t want to be my friend anymore. I just can\u2019t stop thinking about how i might have messed everything up and i feel so guilty for feeling like i forced myself upon her when she hadn\u2019t had a kiss from a girl before. I\u2019ve tried subtly reaching out and trying to maintain the banter that we normally have at work, but i feel like she might be avoiding me and only talking to me to make me feel better, i\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the anxiety speaking or if what i\u2019m feeling is legitimate.\nI hope i can go back to how it was before this because i feel so guilty and awful because i love her as a friend and don\u2019t have any romantic feelings for her at all. i thought maybe it was okay because we were both drunk but i can\u2019t be sure the more i think about it \nsorry it\u2019s so long i thought people might need specifics to make a judgement", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Lately my ONLY best friend of 8-9 years has been changing. I had my first child 7 months ago. Even though being pregnant and having a baby has been very physically and emotionally draining for me ( I had preeclampsia ) I\u2019ve tried so hard to maintain my friendship with her. I have been feeling this distance from said friend for a while ( basically ever since I met my child\u2019s father + getting pregnant a year afterwards ) so yesterday I messaged her wondering what\u2019s been going on between us. She ignores me the whole day. She  finally tells me a day later that we are in \u201c different places in our lives\u201d ( and I totally understand and get that ) and that \u201c we are fine\u201d however , she then messaged me a big paragraph about how I drain her of her energy and my situation is, in her words , \u201cbeyond her\u201d. She has never spoken to me like this which left me very confused and upset. Lately , I\u2019ve  been trying to confide in her about my struggles but never once did I ever expect her to relate/fix/ or even give me advice about these things. I just needed a friend to vent too a little. Before I got pregnant I did everything for her. I drove her places , I third wheeled COUNTLESS times , I\u2019ve listened + given advice, been there for her through every heartbreak, etc. In that text message she was VERY condescending and almost had this holier than thou attitude. It made me sick. I even called her up and tried talking it out and she was scoffing and laughing at me. She told me that she only wants me to be \u201chappy and positive\u201d.

They later broke up too. \n\nA month later Kristen tells me out of no where that Sam has been texting her. i asked her to block him, and she told me she did. i believed her. \n\nwhile changing music on her phone i saw him snapchat her, and i asked her why she hasn\u2019t blocked him yet. she told me she forgot and that she would block him then. i believed her. \n\ntwo days later she told me that she thinks i should talk to sam and figure things out. i said no i don\u2019t want to talk to him about anything. i did nothing wrong it was all him. she essentially forced me to hang with him. she picked him up in his car and i didn\u2019t say shit to him. \n\nwe were together for 30 minutes maybe and then she dropped him home. i tell her i was so uncomfortable and that i h\u00e2te him, and that i never want to hang with him again. she agreed and then said she would block him. i believed her. \n\nthat night, she texted me. long story short, she has been hanging with Sam behind my back, going to his house late at night, meeting his family. she even told me how nice his dad was, when i couldn\u2019t meet him because he claimed he wouldn\u2019t like me since i was 16. she as well turned off her Find My Friends, which we keep on for each other in case of an emergency. that summer we had been going out late at night with different guys, so we wanted to be safe. i noticed it was off one time but i didn\u2019t think much of it. \n\nshe said they hung out and he bought her nic and they would talk. her excuse: \u201che has depression and so do i. we can relate on things you can\u2019t\u201d \n\ni was extremely caught off guard. i had no idea this was even happening. she would also use the excuse of her being desperate. \n\nwhat i didn\u2019t understand was. a lot of people have depression. a lot of people can buy you nic. we had so many people to chose from, but she chose Sam. \n\ni was heartbroken. but i forgave her. i felt bad; her mother passed a year back. i didn\u2019t want her being alone. \n\nafter that she promised that she blocked him. and i believed her. again.\n\nfrom that june to october, she eventually unblocked him, without my knowledge, and had been talking to him. again. and hanging out with him. again. \n\ni only found out because today, he messaged me on facebook, and i texted her right away. i sa\u00efd, \u201cguess who texted me\u201d and i told her sam. she immediately goes. what did he say. i sa\u00efd. \u201ci don\u2019t know yet i didn\u2019t answer or look\u201d \u201cwhat did he say\u201d \u201ci just said i don\u2019t know.\u201d then she started to get weird. so i flat out asked her. \u201chave you been talking to him again?\u201d \u201cno why\u201d \u201cjust wondering\u201d \u201cwhy\u201d because we were friends for so long, i knew she was lying. she was acting sus. so i said i believed her. and she said \u201ci might as well tell you...\u201d and then basically told me she\u2019s been hanging with him again. \n\ni was heartbroken. even more than the first time. i trusted her again that she blocked him. she blamed it again that he\u2019s depressed and that she felt bad.\n\ni don\u2019t know what to do. she\u2019s my best friend and i love her so much. i do so much for her. but i have never done anything this horrible to her. \n\nshould i give her another chance or should i cut her off? \n\ni\u2019m done letting people push me around.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

My best friend from uni (who I had only met in my last year) and I both moved to the same city, but I started working and she studied for another year. I loved her to pieces but I really don\u2019t feel close to her at all now and I haven\u2019t for a while. We\u2019ve both changed a lot since uni, and she got really obsessed with dating apps to the point where she would just ignore me when we were together, constantly swiping and texting guys - she even once kicked me out so that she could meet a guy who randomly asked her out on a whim. She\u2019s also super sensitive about relationship stuff - which I get, everyone has their issues. But it got to the point when she was being kind of a bitch to guys who had done literally nothing - she even sent hate to one guy for not texting her enough when it was the week of his granddad\u2019s funeral!\n\nI was sick of it and all the \u2018boy drama\u2019, I called her out and tried to help her get her shit together but we ended up drifting apart early this year and tbh I was totally fine with that - shit happens and people grow up. But few months ago (looooong since we were friends) she just sort of seemed to realise that I wasn\u2019t around anymore and started sending me really soppy-kind-of-guilt-trippy messages out of the blue and I really don\u2019t know how to respond to it - she\u2019s talking to me like I\u2019m one of her shitty exes from tinder. \n\nI might have seen a way for us to get close again if it wasn\u2019t for this, but now I don\u2019t want to be friends with her at all - I don\u2019t want to be a part of her life but I still want her to be happy. the issue is that she\u2019s really not the sort of person I can sit down and have an adult conversation with, shes very sensitive and takes everything extremely personally and I know that I would just end up hurting her - I don\u2019t mind her hating me but I don\u2019t want to give her cause to hate in herself you know? \n\nI\u2019ve been trying to gently hint for her to leave me alone, leaving messages for a while before replying, swerving as politely as I can, keeping my responses short and engaging as little as possible. But the message that\u2019s brought me here for help is her saying that she though our friendship meant more to me than this - it seem like she\u2019s angry and hurt, which I can understand. She meant a lot to me and I really don\u2019t want to hurt her even though it seems like I already have, but from my point of view we haven\u2019t been friends for nearly a year and this is a really random message to get.\n\nHow do I get her to realise that people just grow apart sometimes and stop messaging me without hurting her? Do I ghost her? Is there something I can say to inadvertently get her to move on without causing pain? Has anyone had this issue before?\n\nAny advice is much appreciated, thank you &lt;3 x", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

{"post_id": "do4oxd", "created_utc": 1572241386, "title": "I'm scared that our friendship is deteriorating (long post)", "author": "LyonsLogic123", "self_text": "I have been best friends with Kourt for almost 7 years now, living together as roommates for the past 2 years. We actually do really well as roommates, despite having to share a single bathroom last year, my only annoyance was her propensity for daily hour-long baths that seemed to coincide with my bladder, but I digress. I hope this doesn't sound like I'm completely shit-talking her, but I've had all this building up for the past few years, so its a lot.\n\nI suppose its best to start with the communication issue, as its easiest to explain. We recently discovered that a good amount of our arguments or disputes occur because Kourt doesn't always get rhetorical questions, so when I'm complaining about an inconvenience and say something like \"Why do they do this stupid thing?\" She'll start explaining to me why it is the way it is, which leads to me feeling invalidated and dismissed. I don't know if our discovery of this is actually going to fix things, because I know it'll most likely be one-sided, where I'll have to be the one to recognize that she's not getting it.  It's also frustrating because she'll rant to me about the same kind of problems but when I do it, it goes completely over her head and I have to be the one to say \"I'm not looking for answers, I'm just venting.\" She'll go on about \"What do you expect me to do when you come in asking questions?\"\n\nAnother issue is her defensiveness, and it comes in many forms. One thing is she always interprets things as a challenge, for example, she was contemplating attending a concert but was unsure because of the cost, I asked her how much and she said $100 (keep in mind we're broke college kids)  and I responded with \"Ugh.\" She looks at me and says \"Well now I feel like I have to go just to spite you.\" What the actual fuck? I said \"Ugh\" and she interprets that as \"Kourt that is a horrible idea and you would be wasting your money and time attending that concert.\" \n\nAnother, more problematic example came with our other roommate who expressed discomfort with Kourt's lack of modesty. I would like to emphasis here that ***she was not shaming her,*** in fact, she was going out of her way to make it clear that she wasn't trying to be offensive or slut-shame. For context, our roommates Amanda and Hope would frequently wear large shirts with just underwear, the shirts were large enough to cover their asses; Kourt, on the other hand, wore her underwear and a tank top with open sides and no bra, a nip-slip waiting to happen, covering only half of her ass. I knew Kourt wasn't offended, more amused than anything, but mentioned: \"I feel like I would be giving in if I were to change clothes now.\" Now, I'll give credit where credit is due she did start wearing t-shirts after an hour of screwing with our roommate \"Is it because you think I'm ugly Amanda?\" \n\nLook, I get the whole \"When people tell me to do something, I automatically don't want to do it.\" But these weren't situations of people telling her what to do, I made a *noise* with no context as to what it was directed towards, and our roommate was expressing her discomfort. I actually had to act as a moderator between Amanda and Kourt if only because I knew how to better convey things to Kourt as her typical go-to response is \"I am dressed decently, you can't see my nips, and it covers the top half of my ass so my whole ass is covered. Why can't you just let me be comfortable?\"\n\nShe also only wants to complain about things, and I mean this in the sense of my mom asked us \"How are you liking your new roommates?\" And I was telling her how I loved them and we got along great and they were a huge step up from our roommate from last year who left Moe's on the counter, *for over a month*, and had a friend of theirs who was kicked out of his place stay over *for two months*; but Kourt only talked about how annoying it was that they left dishes in the sink. That's all she talked about, despite the fact that I know that she likes our roommates a lot, she just doesn't know how to not complain about things.\n\nI also call her a vegan sometimes, not because she's actually a vegan but because she has the same superiority with certain topics. I once told how I dropped a contact on the floor back when I wore contacts and she was gobsmacked, \"How do you even drop a contact? It's in your eye 95% of the time. I've never had that happen to me.\" Insinuating that because it never happened to her, it can never happen to anyone else or you're a massive idiot if it did happen. She does this a lot. Apparently she's also never broken glass before and it's not that hard to not drop something on accident, and she doesn't understand how people fall into the toilet, \"Do they just not look down before they sit?\"\n\nThe thing that makes me the most upset though, is just how dismissive she is. This is especially hard for me because I am the one who constantly gets talked over, interrupted, or ignored in my family, and in my friend group. Whenever I have an injury or am in pain, she just groans or scoffs and calls me overdramatic, which, I'll complain a lot when I'm in pain, but I don't exaggerate my injuries. I hurt my knee exercising, and after expressing concern over the swelling, she brushed me off telling me \"It's just a muscle ache.\" Turns out I had some form of tendinitis from attempting the move multiple times without allowing my tendon time to heal. One time we were having a dumb argument, about worldbuilding and she thought I was making it harder for myself because I was worldbuilding before the plot instead of after when I can just bend the world to my will. I was near tears at this point in the argument, I was just so frustrated and she kept interrupting or cutting me off and I told her \"Can I please, for the love of God, get through the next sentence without you interrupting?\" She said fine, but halfway through my sentence she *fucking* interrupts me and at that point, I just burst into tears and stopped the conversation. \n\nAnytime I express any kind of concern towards her or tell her about some of the problems I have listed here, she completely dismisses me. \"You're so mean to me.\" Being mean is not the same as pointing out a problem. \"I know that I'm defensive, it's just the way I am, and I like it like that anyway.\" I don't even know how I can respond to these kinds of things. She always makes it out to be my problem, \"That sounds like a you problem.\" Or, \"Go cry in the corner about it.\"\n\nI get that it's a family thing with her, she told me how her family's motto is \"Never living it down,\" because whatever mistake you make will be held against you forever, and she said this fondly. I told it sounds horrible and might explain her need to justify herself at every turn, and she told me no, I was wrong, and that she did it to her family too. Her family life is exhausting and as an outsider, even I felt constantly belittled by the comments some of her family members would make. I also acknowledge that I might not be handling these things in the best way, I'm a very emotional person with anxiety and Kourt is basically my only friend and I'm terrified of being abandoned by her so I tend to put up with it and ignore the problem afterwards. I know I have a tendency to project sometimes when I'm frustrated and I'm trying to stop but it's hard when she doesn't even seem to care that I'm frustrated in the first place. I know that she's nicer to me and less physical (she used to hit our friend Wyatt playfully but not me) but I feel like thats the only thing she does, everything else is just me, struggling to appease her.\n\n I'm sorry this is so long, it's just been a lot of small things building up over years of friendship. I love Kourt, I really do, which is why I want to work on these things instead of letting them fester. But it's hard to fix something that the other person doesn't see as a problem in the first place. \n\nHonestly, any advice is appreciated at this point. Thank you.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

At this point, I'm desperate for every form of advice. So don't be surprised if you see this on other subreddits too.\n\nDamn ok here we go.\n\nBefore the second grade, I switched schools from an all private school, to a private (and catholic) elementary school. It took a while for me to fit in. But at around grade 5 or 6, (I believe that there were no catholic middle schools in British Columbia. So catholic elementary schools went up to grade 7) I decided on my role and how I wanted to be seen. I had decided to be the squad hopper of my grade. During my elementary years, there were 2 main groups. The popular kids, and the rest. It was a class of between 28-30, as people came and gone overtime. Though, the popular groups sometimes split into sub-groups depending on the sport being played during recess. Around that time, (I was born 2004, so around 2015-16 and such) I had grown accustomed to like this girl I'll refer to as !Z. She was the tall girl in our class growing up. (don't get any bright ideas, I heard Tall Girl was basura) !Z was in the already mentioned popular group. I never really started to have feelings for her until like grade 3 or 4.  And because of me squad hopping, we were cool with each other and were (at the time) friends. Though, I made one mistake that I regret to this day. \n\nBeing the tuff guy I was, I told basically most of the people in class. I told them to keep it secret, but it really wasn't a secret anymore. Soon enough, I'm sure around 90% of people in my class knew (not sure of !Z ) knew of my little thing towards !Z. I remember after lunch recess while walking back to our classrooms, I was talking about crushes with !Z and if we had any. Basically, I confessed there and then. Her reaction was a simple \"Really?\". I'm not sure if it was meant she was surprised or disgusted. Though, she said she understood. From there, I just assumed she was thinking about her answer. Looking back now I'm 99% sure that it was a no. \n\nAround 2 months within my 7th grade, I found out about a dance for grade 6/7 kids happening once a month until April/May (can't remember) @ a rec center near by. I brought up the news to the class. All the popular kids were all hype about it and planned ahead. !Z never went to it though. Until the very last dance of that school year. When it was held at a high rise conference room beside the local sports stadium/center. When I found out she was going, I knew I had to ask her for a dance. All of my friends were dancing with each other. And @ the time, whoever you danced with was made a ship. Lucky for me, when I asked !Z to slow dance, she said \"sure\" with the happiest smile I've seen her been. \n\nI brought up the same question during my first high school winter dance (8th grade). Most of the class went to the same catholic high school 1 or 2 cities down. Again, she said yes. And we it was a grand time. Although, I also planned something else to ask her. \n\nBeing the awkward 8th grader I was, I had asked her to speak privately after the dance. I had popped the question to ask her out. Mind be you, a short, and fat asian boy was asking her out. She stated that she wasn't ready for a relationship. Obviously, I was hurt, but I understood. Though I really fucked up when I just left her with a simple \"ok\" in after she replied.  Slowly until the beginning of 9th grade, we slowly started to talk less. It didn't help that I never had any classes with her. Combining that and my lack of experience with romance only going as far as having one crush. The last conversation I remember having with her is me saying my spring break sucked (9th grade @ the time). She replied with \"why?\",  and I never responded. \n\nCurrently, I'm in the 10th grade. And i'm not sure if I still like her or not. Like, I still think she's lowkey hot, but I still have no classes with her this year (the high school I go to runs on a system of 2 semesters.) I haven't talked to her (or in this case, dm her) since the end of spring break of this year. Since then, I've been focusing more on the fashion and how to display myself on social media (still a WIP). My problem here is that I don't think she sees me in a good light. I think this is due to how I'm never stuck into one personality. One day I focus on one thing, next day I want to beat it up. One similarity though is that I'm loud and try to make witty remarks during class if it's wide open. Though, I can give an opinion if asked seriously and if I have one (50/50 chance here). Because of my fickle mindedness however, I fear that she sees me as some kind of attention whore (which I agree I kind of am). Plus now, I fear talking to girls. Especially !Z, which I see in the hallway time to time, but we never make eye contact. \n\nI don't think she really likes me at all anymore. \n\nThe advice I'm looking for is how I should approach or talk to her. As I'm definitely not hot, and I suck at using snapchat/instagram dms. I've tried to sb once or twice with no response/left unread (I keep streaks with her tho if that counts for anything) I just want to rekindle a friendship. I don't want to come across as a nice guy and try to force her to date me, as I'm trying to move past that. And if it isn't successful, how do I move on? As I've already tried to push away all romantic feelings I had for her aside since the beginning of 2018 (second semester of 8th grade). I just want closure, but I don't want to come across as an asshole. Any advice would be of value to me.\n\nP.S. - Sorry for paragraphs of just context, I just wanted to get a backstory in.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Even though she was a year ahead of me, we always talked to each other because I always see her. We were in band, we went to the same church and school, and we even ended up in some college classes. There was something about Jackie that I just couldn\u2019t avoid, and I didn\u2019t know if that was cuz I was Filipino and she was like the only Filipino in band and I had that mentality that Filipinos should stick together cuz we\u2019re in America and Filipino pride or if I just really wanted a friend that I thought would understand me. Anyway, she quit band in high school and I continued and mostly hung out with band people, but Jackie and I still remained friends that would talk a lot if we meet up in the hallways. That was when she got into her \u201cvery blunt\u201d phase where she would say stuff like \u201cI hate how the saxophone sounds. People that play the saxophone should die.\u201d Even though I played saxophone. I brushed it off and didn\u2019t think anything about that. I thought she was just trying to be edgy. Life went on. She started dating someone and we hadn\u2019t talk for a couple of years until I had ENG 102 with her in college. At that point she left her asshole of a boyfriend and her parents have basically monitor everything she does 24/7. I felt bad cuz I understand how that feels, so I became her support system for a good 2 years. We would talk a lot about how our parents should ease up on us cuz we\u2019re in our 20s, some cute guys in tv, and dating advice cuz I\u2019m in a relationship and she wanted to know \u201cmy ways\u201d cuz I\u2019m happy with him. When her parents finally gave her freedom to work, I got her to start working where I work, and it was fun. We were basically inseparable at that point. It was around this time that she felt she was ready to be in a relationship. So my bf and I set her up with one of our friends. Since we were all adults, we just exchanged their numbers and let them handle it from there. Of course, I would check up on her to see how things were going and she would always ask advice cuz texting is stressful. It seemed fine, but she would always have doubts about things and read into every little detail. I kept reassuring her that things are fine and she shouldn\u2019t sweat it cuz we knew the guy. He is nothing like her ex and is genuinely sweet. It was already at the point where she wanted to dtr that shit hit the fan. I told her to just ask a simple \u201care we bf gf?\u201d And she wrote him a whole story about how her life was shit, that she was damaged goods, that she used to be suicidal, that he deserves so much better, and that she doesn\u2019t know if she had anything to offer. I understood where she was going with it, but this is too much to handle in the courting/getting to know each other stage. He told my bf and I that he was going to cut it cuz he doesn\u2019t wanna go through the same stuff that he went through from a previous relationship. I warned her about it cuz I couldn\u2019t stand seeing her crushed cuz she wanted it to work out. She not only shut down the guy, but also threw us under the bus and told him that I told her. I got upset, but forgave her for it. She responded it by \u201csaying goodbye forever\u201d and blocking me for a week. She then unblocked me again and sent a long apology about how she was wrong for throwing me under the bus and all that. I was angry about it cuz I honesty was worried about her and what she was going to do to herself. I let it slide cuz, she needs someone to get through this with. The talks then got really annoying about how guys suck and that she using this dude to get fit, but she doesn\u2019t like the fact that he\u2019s still trying to court her and stuff. She then asked how my bf feels about the fact that he lost his \u201closer of a friend\u201d and it was just the last straw. I went off on her and I told her that her \u201cglow up\u201d is never going to help her find anyone that will actually take her seriously and that she was acting immature. She then went off on how the whole set up with the guy was my fault and how I should\u2019ve been holding her hand the whole time. She then told me that I was a hypocrite because I kept telling her to work on herself. I said I was sorry for lashing out and she told me that she wasn\u2019t mad at me and that she was mad at the guy. I thought it was going to be fine until she pulled another \u201cgoodbye forever\u201d. At that point I was furious because we still work together. So i went to work the next day, and lo and behold, she would not talk to me. Not even as coworkers that need to get stuff done. She would avoid me even when we were pair up to do something. I can\u2019t handle it because I still care for her, but I also can\u2019t properly grieve the friendship because I still have to see her all the time at work. This has been going on since August.

I'm either regarded invisible, or as a burden -- never as a human, or an equal.\n\nNow, to put myself to bed, I listen to ASMR where the person roleplays as a father, saying \"I love you\", and reading bedtime stories. It's only after crying my frustrations out that I'm able to finally fall asleep -- by lying to myself, pretending that someone loves me.\n\nI know that people in my house can hear me when I do this. They just really don't care.\n\nI've been way past the verge of giving up for almost as long as I can remember.\n\nIf someone out there could give me a reason to keep on living, that would be all I'd need to get through another day.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

He struggles to make friends, online and off, and I want to be able to help him find someone. With his permission, he is allowing me to make a post on this subreddit in the hopes that he can find a new friend, one that he can trust and bond with for years to come. Fun facts about him:\n\nHe is a 17 year old male from Canada.\n\nHe is a mega nerd! He loves Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Star Trek: The Next Generation, and is a big movie fan (he likes depressing movies for some reason-he claims that it's because they can cheer you up when you're already down).\n\nHe is a fan of music, particularly Childish Gambino (\"because he's hot and beautiful and talented\") and Frank Ocean (\"because he has the voice of an angel\"). He listens to almost anything though.\n\nHe enjoys videogames! His favorites include Witcher and Red Dead Redemption. He actually bought me Monster Prom and Dream Daddy for my birthday, which he's played with me as well.\n\nOnce he broke his knuckles punching a door. If you want to why, please message him cause I still have no idea why.\n\nHe has a cute dog and an adorable cat! If you want pic, feel free to message him in exchange for friendship.\n\nPlease do not bother him if your intentions are to ghost him after a day. I wouldn't be making this post if that were the goal. I care about this tall idiot very much, so it hurts me when I see him struggle to make friends. So if you are interested in making a new friend for life, please message u/holdithorizontalman on reddit, and hopefully you guys can hit it off! Thank you!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Evelyn has been my friend for about 3 years. We became friends when she helped me out during a bad phase of my life, where I got bullied and was trying to find myself amidst all the bullsh*t in my life. \n\nWe get along super well, she has a lot of drama with her usual clique so when she\u2019s with me, her exact words are \u2018when I\u2019m with you, I don\u2019t have to worry about any drama because you make me feel so carefree\u2019. I\u2019m not much of a drama-lover, sh*t like that makes me run from the sight of it which is why I don\u2019t really approve/like her clique because it\u2019s filled with troublemakers but I can\u2019t and won\u2019t tell her sh*t like to stop hanging out with them. I don\u2019t have the right to and they\u2019re her most precious friends so okay, fine. \n\nAmongst her friends, she\u2019s always the mediator because she\u2019s always on the neutral side and almost never takes a side (just wants the best for both parties, I suppose). She\u2019s really sweet and tries to figure out solutions for both parties because she just can\u2019t leave them alone and wants them to all be happy... which I think is sort of silly and not always the best attitude to have because drama breaks out very frequently in their group to the point where I would deem it as almost toxic and all these problems that she has to mediate builds up stress and it took a toll on her not long ago. It\u2019s self-destructive in her case, and while I adore her for being such a caring and loving individual she just doesn\u2019t know when to stop and care for herself. \n\nRecently, a problem broke out between a couple in her clique. Girl broke up with guy heartlessly and didn\u2019t bother to get closure when she broke up and only asked for closure AFTER guy moved on. TL;DR the most stupid problem I\u2019ve ever heard\n\nShe played mediator as always, got really fed up with everything, but can\u2019t bring herself to stop meddling because it involved two of her dearest friends. I told her to stop, and that it was their problem, not hers. She refused and continued to try to \u2018help\u2019. Problem got solved eventually because the couple decided to use common sense and talk things out. I\u2019m still mad at her for flooding my DMs with vulgarities and asking for help when I\u2019m done with giving her advice that she won\u2019t take. It ruined my mood for the entire week. \n\nNow what am I supposed to think? I really don\u2019t know, I love the girl to the moon and back but I\u2019m so done with her attitude. It\u2019s not her job to settle other people\u2019s problems and I\u2019m honestly tired of telling her that she should stop making other peoples\u2019 problems her own because she\u2019s doing it so frequently to the point where it worries me especially when she has family issues to worry about and these family issues take a huge toll on her mental well-being. \n\nTL;DR I\u2019m lowkey done with my friend\u2019s self-destructive attitude but want to keep the friendship.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I\u2019m just looking for a few people to talk to every once in a while. I\u2019ve had to move around the states several times in my life, so it\u2019s become progressively more difficult to make friends as I get older. I was in Illinois for half my childhood, then Florida for college, back to Chicago for med school, and now Pennsylvania for residency. Through all that, I\u2019ve made friends, then slowly drift apart as I move. I\u2019m still in touch with my med school friends, and I have new friends now. However, in about a year I\u2019ll be alone again, and that realization is giving me anxiety. If anyone else is in that perpetual state of loneliness, let\u2019s be lonely together. \n\nAbout me:\nI hate this part. At every interview where they say \u201ctell me about yourself,\u201d I have no idea what to say, because I have no idea who I am. Looking back at life, my values, my goals, and my dreams have all changed. Physically, skin sheds every day, blood changes every 3 month, bones change every decade, and even nerves change. So I have no clue who I am.\n\nI\u2019m 27 years old, single with no kids and no pets. Hobbies at this point primarily just consist of video games, reading, and board games, and cooking. I used to be into paintball, and I was a ref for about a year in college. I\u2019d say volunteering too, but sadly I don\u2019t have time to anymore. I\u2019ve volunteered at soup kitchens, food pantries, nursing homes, hospitals, temple, and so many more. As far as reading, I love fantasy and have recently started exploring Asian novels (light novels and wuxia novels). I only play on the Xbox so if you\u2019re only looking for someone to play with, I\u2019ll add you. I\u2019m not sure how to continue, so I\u2019m summation, send me a message and we\u2019ll talk.

{"post_id": "doko0j", "created_utc": 1572321687, "title": "She's doing it again, really need advice!", "author": "Mannggo", "self_text": "Alright, lets start from the beginning. I've known this girl, lets call her, Stephanie, since 2015, when we first met we became best friends fast. We did everything together, we were always hanging out and living life. I considered her my sister, we were that close. But in October of 2015, she confessed to me that she doesn't believe in best friends anymore, and things just got weird after that. By the end of October, she had stopped coming to school due to mental health issues; at this time I didn't really understand mental health. \n\nAfter she left school, she really stopped being my friend I would try and reach out to her and help but she pushed me away and that hurt me, as it would hurt anyone. I'll admit, I talked shit on her after and since then I've taken full responsibility for it. She made me the bad guy, and we didn't speak for almost three years after we stopped being friends. \n\nNow that you have that backstory, let me tell you about whats going on now. \n\nIn October of 2018, I was sexually assaulted, I left public school and at this time I reached out to her to apologies for talking shit and whatever else and we became friends again really quick. Things were really good, there was no problems or anything but I was struggling a lot with my relationship falling apart and just being traumatized. Around Feb. of this year, she started acting in her old ways. She has two other friends, lets call them Ethan and Jaclyn. I was friends with Jaclyn for a little bit in the middle of 2016 but Jaclyn had some trouble with me and our friendship ended. Now Stephanie, and the two of them have been friends for the time that me and her were not talking. \n\nAs stated before, I was sexually assaulted and the ended me up doing online school. Since I started doing school online, I lost all my friends from public school, that meant I was not getting out of my house at all. The only time I was getting out was when I was hanging out with Stephanie, but we also only hung out once or twice a month. She often made plans with Ethan and Jaclyn and would then hide it from me. She said it was because she didn't want to upset me at first but when I finally confronted her about it, she told me it was because it wasn't her responsibility to give me opportunities to get out and meet new people. Which, she is correct about, it's not her responsibility, but I never once told her or implied that it was her responsibility. She also told me that she didn't think I was capable of conversing with her friends because how quiet I am when I met knew people and that she didn't want her friends to be uncomfortable because of me.\n\nThat hurt me, but I let it go because I assumed she was coming from a place of love. In Aug of this year, I was finally introduced to Ethan and me and Jaclyn finally saw each other. Ethan and I became fast friends within the hour, and from then on I had gained two new friends, and for the first time in years, I was going out every weekend with people my age. Now put up until this point, everything was fine, the four of us were a power team, the best of friends. I've never felt more cared for by friends then I have with them. \n\nNow, before I get into this week, let me tell you the other things Stephanie does. She is the girl who makes herself into the victim in every situation, no matter what it is she will find a way to make herself the victim. If you try to be honest with her, you are the one attacking her and you're the one in the wrong. If something bad happens in her life, it is everyone else's fault but hers. (Side note: Stephanie has depression and anxiety.) She smokes weed to help with her mental illness but she's never once treated it like it was something to help her, she uses it as a way to look cool. She has be prescribed Anti-Depressants, now if you know anything about that, then you know that anti-depressants don't work unless you are also doing other things in your life to improve. Which, is something Stephanie won't do, there is an excuse for why she can't do something. She also won't take her anti-depressants because they \"don't work.\" We've given her so many healthy coping mechanisms and she refuses to do them because there is always something stopping her. She won't try painting to cope because her hands shake, she won't write how she feels because she's not a good writer. None of that matters, the whole point is to just try. She complains about her body often, but won't make any effort to change things. It's proven that faking confidence builds confidence, she won't even try that. Your thoughts influence your emotions and your emotions influence your actions If you are always going to think about how hard life is and how sad you are, then that's going to become negative emotions and actions. You have to want to be better, to get better. She just doesn't want to be better, she doesn't want it bad enough so she just doesn't try and expects everyone else to fix her life for her. \n\nI've thought this for a while, but I always felt really bad about thinking about her that way because she was there when no one else wasn't. \n\nSo, that brings me to this week. On Wednesday, she posted on her Snapchat that she was going on a social media break and that if we needed her to text her number. I texted her a paragraph expressing how much I cared about her ect. and then texted Jaclyn to know if she had heard anything. Jaclyn told me no and from then on me and her started talk about how worried we were, and then we both realized that we had been feeling the same way about what Stephanie had been doing. We called and I found out that Stephanie didn't even want me to join her friend group, that she was weirdly hesitant about letting me in. Jaclyn also informed me that Stephanie had implied that Jaclyn needed to dress down her appearance because it makes her really upset that Jaclyn is confident in her body. After that, we noticed that Stephanie's complements always came with a a shot to herself. \"Your makeup looks so good, I'm really ugly I couldn't ever do that.\" or \"You're so good at art, I suck so bad I could never.\"\n\nWe also realized that she has never gone out of her way to tell her that she appreciate us, and that she would only express that after one of us had told her that we really love and appreciate her. I'm one for sending random paragraphs to my friends to make their day, when ever I send Stephanie one its only ever followed by, \"You're so good a writing, I can't do that. Ily\" We then noticed that Stephaine never actually listens to how her friends are feeling, she will ask how you are and then always respond with, \"I'm so sorry, wish I could take away your pain.\" which is always followed by her talking about herself again. \n\nAfter realizing how toxic she is, we decided that we should probably try to distance ourselves because it's not good our us to be friends with someone who won't ever try or take responsibility. After a few days though, we started to feel guilty again because Stephanie is going through a tough time. During this time though, I invited Jaclyn to come see a movie with Ethan and I on the 27th. Ethan and I had made this plan weeks ago, but we weren't able to see the movie we wanted to see because he had to work during the day. We then decided to go see Joker, and I invited Jaclyn. During this time, Stephanie was barely texting any of us back, we also knew that Joker is a movie with hard subject matter and how it would be triggering to Stephanie, which we had told her before.\n\nRemember now I said that Stephanie never invited me to things and hid stuff from me when she did go out? Well, on Sunday, she asked Jaclyn what she was doing, Jaclyn said she was going to see and movie with Ethan, me and her two other friends. Stephanie then told Jaclyn that she should have been invited, and it's really unfair that she wasn't invited and that its really mean that we were hiding it from her. We were not hiding it from her at all. She then texted me out of know where to complain about being hurt about not being invited, and I told her the truth, how she did the same thing to me for months and how she hid it from me. I also told her that we were thinking about her well-being because we all knew how triggered she would get if she watched Joker. Hell, that movie was even hard for me to watch and that's coming from someone who watches horrors movies and is into true-crime and researching how the mind works. So I told her that we had made the plans weeks ago and how we invited Jaclyn last minute. She threw a fit about it and then left me on read. \n\nFast forward to today, I texted her to make sure she was okay and she told me how she's still upset about not being invited and how her not inviting me to things isn't the same as us not inviting her because, \"I introduced you to them and i always make sure you get invited after you became friends with them. \" Which is what I said the night before, that I only started getting invited to things AFTER I became apart of the group. She then tried to say that she could have been mad at me for not inviting her to hang with me and my two other friends, whom I don't see or speak to very often. Which, if she would have asked to come I would have brought her along I have nothing wrong with that. So she explained she was still hurt and upset. \n\nThat's fine, she had every right to that but she again wasn't looking at the bigger picture. I expressed that I was worried about this happening when I became part of the group because I didn't want her to think I was stealing her friends, and often times I always invited her to hang out when I made plans with them. I put my friendship with her over my two other friends because I didn't want drama. I expressed again that she did the same thing to me and that she's said worse to me and how I let it go because I thought she was just looking out for me. I also explained how hard Joker was for me to watch and how much she would have struggled if she watched it. \n\nAt this point in the conversation, I got fed up and I told her what we've all been thinking, that she needs to try and want to be better, that her friends cannot fix her life for her and that she needs to be proactive with her life or things aren't going to get any easier. I also told her many healthy ways to cope and explained before she even responded that I wasn't in any form trying to attack her. Albe it, I was being harsh with her and I understand how that could have come off and I took responsibility for it. Yet, she still turned me into the horrible friend, and now she has to, \"Rethink parts of our friendship.\" I told her like it is, because I was so sick and tired of always beating around the bush because I didn't want to get turned into the bad guy again. She basically told me she was gonna continue the conversation when she had her thoughts in order and then said she loved me and goodnight. \n\nI know first hand how hard it is to have depression, my dad is dead, we're struggling financially, I was sexually assaulted. I have diagnosed depression, severe anxiety, and ptsd. I also don't have the same support that she has, she has a family that loves her and makes sure she is able to do anything that she wants. I don't have that, I can't be on anti-depressants, I can't smoke weed, I can't afford to go and do things all the time, and I can't drive anywhere to do anything either. I've never been one to say that I have it worse, because all pain and struggling is valid, but I've never seen someone with so much do so little to help themselves. If she's uncomfortable somewhere, or something doesn't go her way while she's out, she gonna throw a fit and make us take her home on the spot, or complain to her mom to come get her. She drags me to her family events because she doesn't want to be uncomfortable and if I don't agree to do, she'll make me feel bad about it and talk about how she's not going now. I shouldn't be at her family events, because it's even more uncomfortable for me to be around complete strangers and have to awkwardly stand behind her while she talks to her family. \n\nI know what it's like to not have any motivation to do anything, to hate yourself and your life. But, I also know that i don't want to spend the rest of my life being sad and complaining. I still have bad days, I still struggle to look at myself in the mirror and love myself. I still struggle to figure out who I am after having my whole identity being stripped by my sexual assault. I know how hard it is to force yourself, but in the last three months I've been pushing myself to go out of my comfort zone, to do things I used to love. To let people in and not push them away, and she refuses to grow and that's so fucking sad. \n\nMy point is, she's doing exactly what she did to me in 2015, the only difference is I understand mental health now and that I know I'm not the one doing something wrong. At least, I don't think that I am but please tell me if I'm wrong. I just don't want to go through this again with her, because really hurt me all those years ago and her other friends during that time would make me the bad guy too. I don't want the friendship end because I do care for her deeply, but at this point I don't know if it's worth it or not. I don't know what to do anymore, please help me!!", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

She also happens to go with a kid she was friends with for a short time in middle school.\n\nShe told me a while ago that she stop talking to him because he was an asshole. I never thought much of it because I didn\u2019t ever interact with him. Then sophomore year I get sat next to him in a class. He was friends with some of my other friends so I tried to talk to him. For about a year straight he would respond to everything I said sarcastically and would frequently imply that I was stupid. He continued to do this to me in Junior year when I got sat next to him again. He also helped some kids who didn\u2019t like me spread rumors about me that strained a lot of my friendships and ruined one.\n\nSenior year comes along and my closest friend doesn\u2019t have an easy way to get to college because she can\u2019t drive and it\u2019s far from her house.

I actually was close with everyone before we all started hanging out together as a group. I introduced Gwen to my other two friends, Timmy and Kelly, who were already friends(fake names btw). I consider Gwen my best friend. Our friendship as a group really kicked off during our senior year of high school. Oh boy good times. Then we graduated and Timmy, went away to college which is sad but we all still keep in touch with him and visit. As for the rest of us, we are going to a community college together. Gwen and I have always been closer than with Kelly and she was closer with Timmy. But Gwen and I made an effort together to get closer with Kelly and we accomplished that. It would always be the three of us when we hung out, Gwen and Kelly never hung out alone. I've known Kelly for a long time but we just never hung out as often in high school as me and Gwen. Gwen and Kelly didn't know each other till I introduced them so it made sense why we always would hang out as a group. It's now our second year of college and recently things have seemed different. Gwen and Kelly seemed to have randomly clicked which of course is great but they are starting to leave me out. I feel like such a child for being upset over this. I should be ok for them to hang out alone, I don't own them. But I still can't help but feel so sad. Yesterday, Gwen wanted to go out to lunch with me but I declined because I explained I need to start saving money. Later that night, they sent a picture of themselves wearing face masks to our group chat (which includes Timmy btw). So I said \"oh you guys are hanging out?\" Kelly said \"yeah me and gwen got lunch and just kept hanging out\" so I said \"that's nice, glad you're having fun\" It was pretty late so they had been hanging out all evening and nighy together. I told Gwen I wasn't working that day which is why she invited me to lunch. Since I declined it is reasonable to turn to Kelly to go to lunch. What upsets me is that she didn't invite me after lunch since I wouldn't be working. God I do should like a child but I can't shake this feeling of hurt. It wasn't just this time either. What kills me is that I've been going through a really rough time in life and they know this. They should know that I could use some fun and at least invite me out. I'm always there for them but guess that isn't enough. I don't think they were intentionally trying to hurt me. I think they simply just forget about me. So idk which is worse?

I broke up with my ex at the beginning of the year for whom I had been dating for almost 4 years. Then a few months later, my best friend started becoming very mentally unstable and then broke our friendship. I was asking for advice from my other 2 friends on how I could be better and fix the friendship, and they gave me good advice about how he wasn\u2019t mentally fit to be friends and that we need space. A few weeks later, without any warning, those 2 friends that I asked advice from said that they needed space from me because I was asking too much advice from them and they weren\u2019t getting enough from the friendship (there were no warnings and I asked how come they didn\u2019t show any warning that would have hinted my wrongdoings but they couldn\u2019t give me a good explanation). Also, right after the breakup I was slammed with a huge existential crisis that ultimately led to me developing a horrible case of death anxiety.\n\nI simply go to class (it\u2019s my last quarter), do my homework on campus, then go to sleep and rinse and repeat. The friends that I lost were my core friend group, so the amount of depression has been accelerating on me. I see people on Instagram having the time of their lives. I see people with good friend groups having a good time. My parents are divorced so I just live with my dad, and we don\u2019t have the best relationship. I visit my mom from time to time since our relationship is pretty good.\n\nIt almost feels like I lost a part of my life from my breakup, and another big chunk from my core friend group. I compare myself to others sometimes and I see people my age moving to cool places (and I love where I live, but I\u2019ve never had the out of state experience). Or right now I see people going to Halloween parties and I\u2019ve never been invited to one.  \n\nIt just feels like life won\u2019t get better. I consider myself a nice guy who actually cares about his friends, and asks deep questions. I would do anything for friends like get them gifts, compliment them, take them to cool places around the city I live (a lot of my friends have been people from out of state). I see people who are rude have a lot of friends. \n\n2019 has been the hardest year of my life. It has really flipped my life 360 degrees. I would gave never expected to be here a year ago.

I guess the good thing recently is that I finally found a therapist so I hope to work things out. I want happiness. I want to have a core friend group. \n\nI don\u2019t really know what I am going to achieve by writing this, but having you guys listening to my story just really helps.

I mean he gave his reasoning, and I understood why he did what he did, and it's over, and done with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe lie was about his identity. I met him while he was doing a persona, and after some time he broke down, said he was sorry for it, and gave some pretty strong reasons, for why he RP'd as a crafted persona, rather than himself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think on some level he wanted me to be angry. I think it's almost like he wanted me to be pissed off, but forgive him, and since my reaction was more like; \"Oh? Okay, yeah it's cool man.\" He seems to think I'm lying to him. He'll sometimes just randomly ask me if I hate him, or if I'm upset at him. I keep assuring him that I'm not, and he's like; \"but I lied to you.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's a lot of worrying, and projection he's started doing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome days we're fine, and then it's like he'll just randomly start bringing things up like; \"I don't think we should be friends anymore, because I lied to you.\" At this point I've learned he doesn't mean that, and what he's actually saying is more akin to; \"I think you don't want to be my friend, because I fibbed one time, years ago.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were set to RP, and every time we almost get an RP up he suddenly drops it, because he hates roleplaying as himself. As his persona he feels more confident, but since he came clean to me about who he really is, it's like he feels ashamed, and embarrassed to RP any of his ideas.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich in turn makes me feel bad, because I feel like all I'm doing is just stressing him out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just don't know what to do. Was I supposed to lie? Was I supposed to say; \"Okay yeah...I was really pissed off that you lied to me, but I think our friendship is stronger than that.\" ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease help.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

In public I sadly don't have many friends in person and most of my friends are on here from Reddit. They have been so awesome and nice and I can't thank them enough.  I was hoping I can make friends with more people like that. Don't worry about those I'm already talking with I will still talk with you. Just trying to expand my friends list. \n\nI graduated from college with a degree in film mostly focusing on editing. I suffer from both anxiety and depression. It effects me a lot on day to day basis mostly depression. Some days I'm fine Some I'm not. So if I complain about being depressed please understand I can't control it and at least be sympathetic towards it. \n\nI'm somewhere on the autism spectrum probably closer associated with aspergers. Its not as severe as other people probably. Like you wouldn't think i have It because I'm on the high functioning side of the spectrum. However my social skills are really bad which makes it difficult to make friends in real life. \n\nIn terms of Hobbies. My favorite stuff to do is watch movies or tv shows. Some of my favorite movies are The Dark Knight, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, and Apocalypse Now. Some of my favorite tv shows currently are Big Little Lies, The Handmaid's Tale, Black Mirror, Stranger Things, Westworld, Rick and Morty, American Horror Story, Barry and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. However I watch a lot of other movies and shows as well. I'm also big Fan of Star Wars, Game of Thrones, and Marvel. So feel free to give me suggestions on movies or shows to watch\n\nI love animals particularly Dogs and hamsters. Huskies are my favorite breed but I also love bulldogs. Sadly I don't have a dog or any pet but, would love one in the future. \n\nI'm a big WWE fan or at least try to watch what I can. Been watching since 2006. So if you like WWE that would be awesome. \n\nI love rock music from the 70s-90. My favorite bands are (AC/DC, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Guns N Roses, Kiss, Metallica, and Queen). \n\nOther things I like are to learn about history, conspiracy theories/mysteries even though I don't believe most of them, Memes, and Sports (particular baseball/American football) \n\nSo yeah feel free to message me if any of these things interest you \ud83d\ude03. If you going to message me I recommend you being around my age at least 19-27. I can make some exceptions though. \n\nImportant, don't bother sending me a message if your just going to ghost. It really hurts and I don't like doing that either to others unless we don't connect or something. Also I  don't like when a conversation fizzles out and I don't ever hear from you again. It's fine if your forgot to respond but, I usually think if it fizzles out and you never get back to me. That you don't care to talk again. \n\nDon't care what gender just want friends who share interests to talk. I have Whatsapp, kik, Snapchat and, Discord but I want to keep the conversation on Reddit for now. Until we get to know each other more. I prefer the pm message box and not the chat but whatever works for you. So yeah just msg me your age, gender, and a little bit about yourself so I know you read all this lol.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

The problem is, she hardly ever reaches out to me and it\u2018s difficult to arrange a meetup with her. At this point I should mention that we live 2 hours apart, so meeting would only make sense, if we both take a day off and do something together. Once, there was a situation where she was afraid that I\u2018d cancel our friendship and was glad when I didn\u2018t want to this. In the last year we met up three times and everytime it was a wonderful time for both of us.\n\nWe are not texting regulary as other friends might do this, so a month or two can past before we text and then most of the time it is me who initiates contact. Sometimes she takes a few days to reply, as she mentioned she wants to take her time for my message and craft a thoughtful and long reply instead a short one. That\u2018s true - our messages are always insanely long and contentrich!\n\nThe last time we wanted to do something together she cancled it days before, after she already said she had time on the given date. This was the moment, when I told her that it shouldn\u2018t be that hard in a friendship to meetup like it is in this one and that during the last year, I whished myself she would reach out more and initiate a meetup. She was thankful for my honesty and wants to take my critic to her heart. She wants to try to be more active in our friendship and hopes that I don\u2018t want to end this altogether.\n\nRight now, nothing has really changed. I mean, all of this only happened a few weeks ago and time will show if she wants to play a more active part in our friendship. Another point is that I don't really ever had a friendship with anyone which is super close, so I don't know how a standard friendship should look like. But what is your oppinion in this situation? I told her what I\u2018d like to have in this friendship. Is she too nice to tell me she doesn\u2018t want this friendship?

Some of my favorite series are HxH,Jojo,yuyu hakusho,one piece(new to it,no spoilers!) and soul eater,tho there's a lot more anime I've seen.\n* I play games a lot too! Pokemon,Terraria,Darkest Dungeon,Overwatch rarely,TFT,League(mainly EUNE,but NA too) and again,a ton of games but I can't think of them right now,feel free to ask me!\n\nIf this weird ass list din't scare you off,I would really enjoy it if you contacted me via normal messages,and not the weird chat thing that's just incredibly annoying,as I do not even bother with it.Also,if all you send is something like \"Hi,how are you?\" and something just as short,i will probably give answers just as short,so don't get mad at me!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

She was very mean to me often for no reason whatsoever. She would put me down and call me stupid, she has lashed out on me for no reason at all, saying I\u2019m a dick even if I haven\u2019t done anything wrong, often jealous of other girls that were my friends and would tell me about how they don\u2019t like them.

A bit of background - I'm starting to feel like being a loner isn't nearly as fun as I imagined it, at least not anymore. I've been a shut-in NEET for a few years now and never really had irl friends, but I haven't been very successful at online friendships either. It's gotten to the point where I have literally a single acquaintance that I play a bit of videogames once every few months with, and that's literally it. All of this didn't bother me for a long time, but the loneliness has started making me consistently miserable for a couple months now. I've never been very good at socializing to be honest, but after so long I think I've completely forgotten how to even attempt to make friends? Hence me posting here.  \nI've been struggling with depression and other mental issues for a while, so if that's something you're dealing with I can probably relate and maybe try to help out a bit. I'm from Europe, but since I'm a NEET I'm available whenever and can adapt to whatever timezone. I'm a leftist if that's of any importance. Don't really mind whether you're male, female or non-binary. Open to both text and voice chats.  \nMy hobbies are mostly the average young adult stuff - videogames (don't own any consoles though), anime (although I barely have motivation to watch nowadays), movies (mostly horror), and bits of other stuff here and there like wrestling, specific periods in history (three kingdoms and sengoku jidai mostly) and other stuff. I don't really watch any TV shows other than Always Sunny which I consider to be one of the funniest things ever made, probably says a lot about my sense of humor. I mostly listen to Power Metal and similar genres, although not exclusively. I also spend way too much time on youtube watching ASMR videos.  \nCan't think of much else to write.

I\u2019ll start with the basics. My town feeds into another towns high school which is much larger then our town (50,000 vs our 11,000) so most of the kids at my high school grew up together without me knowing any of them as our elementary school district is separate. So this alone puts me in a harder position from everyone else. I had a group of friends going into high school but as we grew older our differences became more noticeable and I was clearly not in the same thinking as them. They are kinda a strange group of people who had different humor for the most part then I did. They also had a kid in their group who they only use to make fun of and I personally find very annoying. So when they found out I didn\u2019t like him and didn\u2019t talk nice about, they kicked me out of the group due to \u201cnegative energy.\u201d Which is insane cause those who know me know I am like one of the nicest people. Either way it was bound to split as I was not alike with them. Im now in a weird place where I only really have two friends who I feel comfortable asking to hang whenever.  It just feels horrible and it sucks cause I\u2019ve never had problems making friends. But at this point in high school the \u201ccake is baked\u201d and everyone has their friend group already.

Going on 5 months.  It\u2019s been about a year since we saw our casual friend group. We used to be close to a couple in that group (we met because the wife was our realtor), and we\u2019d go out and party together. They got pregnant, we were the first to know. We had lots of fun together and toned it down a bit, but the boys would still tie one on occasionally. I noticed we seemed to not be invited to BBQs and get-togethers every time anymore, and then kinda....never to anything anymore. So I\u2019d make plans privately with this pregnant couple. I love to host dinner parties. So I\u2019d have them over. Our last one was a year ago. She was 8 months pregnant and he got hammered and passed out on our couch during the Seahawks game. We haven\u2019t seen them since. \n\nI know it\u2019s on me to \u201cgo see the baby,\u201d who was born in mid December. It just didn\u2019t happen the first few months after he was born. We travelled the last two weeks of December for Christmas (my family and my in laws are in many different states), then I quit smoking on Jan 1st and subsequently was ill until mid February. Unsure if it was bronchial infection or just side effects from smoking cessation, I stayed away from them and their newborn.  Then once the baby got old enough for them to resume their constant adventure travels again, it just hadn\u2019t worked out for months and now here we are.

It never worked out.  I started to feel the divide more and more.  So I backed off- kinda just told myself that they didn\u2019t want to be friends anymore and they\u2019ve moved on past us. They\u2019re parents now and don\u2019t want us around their kid. Okay, ouch, but okay. I get it. So I stopped reaching out. \n\nThen, a few weeks ago, I commented on a post of the baby, saying how cute he is or whatever. She replied with \u201cif he doesn\u2019t meet his Aunt FuschiaBerry before his birthday, I think he will disown her!\u201d Is this just a rude clap back or an olive branch? I tried to set up plans in my reply, she said something about maybe next month they\u2019ll be available. What the fuck? Okay man. I know I\u2019m in my 30\u2019s but I\u2019m newly sober and everything is fucking with my head nowadays. Can someone please help me wrap my brain around this please? How do I reestablish my friendship with this couple after a year of super low contact? I feel terrible that I haven\u2019t rushed over to meet the baby. Did that seal the end of our friendship?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Anyways one of my friends has strict parents and wants to move out so that she can get away from them and be independent and that is okay if that\u2019s what she wants. My problem is that she\u2019s saying that if we both get into the same university or  university near each other WE can both move in to a flat (apartment) together. Now she wants us to move out even if the university is near by home. That\u2019s where I\u2019m annoyed, if the university is not far from home what\u2019s the point in me moving out and getting a job to pay for rent when my family is happy for me to stay home. I understand that she wants to get away from her over protective dad and I kind of feel sorry for her but she doesn\u2019t need to drag me into that. She never even considered moving until she started arguing with her dad. She does this all the time, for example I want to get a tongue piercing now this month but she\u2019s saying I should wait until she\u2019s able to get it too then we can get it together. As I already said, I feel bad that her parents are strict but that doesn\u2019t give her the right to stop me from doing what I want just because can\u2019t.

I'd say my roommate and I are friends, but it's not really the connection I'm looking for. After I left my last friend group when it became toxic, I've been mostly alone. My school is very cliquey, and I'm in Sophmore year so it's kind of too late.

Should I seek friendships anyways, although I don't think anyone is looking anymore, and I won't have as much time as I'd like to bond with them (I also thought I should mention my school is notoriously known for having a bad social life! A lot of people have told me they've had similar experiences). Should I hope when I move to a new city someday I could meet people through that meetup website? I'm totally lost.

I noticed after I posted a photo with my husband that this friend unfollowed me. I have an app that shows me mutuals for a fairly popular account I run, but use it on my personal occasionally out of curiosity, which is how I noticed. We\u2019ve been friends for 15+ years. We also share plenty of mutual friends as we went to the same elementary, middle, and high school. We went to the same college and lived in the same building freshman year, as well. The point here being, we\u2019ve been good friends for a very long time. We chat on occasion now via a group chat with our other close friends, but rarely interact otherwise. For his birthday this year I posted on his Facebook and his response was along the lines of \u201cI miss you, thanks for taking care of me all these years\u201d which was quite unexpected, but sweet. Since then we\u2019ve had our normal/causal interactions. Nothing in our usual relationship is amiss, aside from the fact that he unfollowed my account. It seems silly, but it was a bit hurtful. I consider the app a nice way to keep up with friends, especially because I don\u2019t live near any of them. I also dug a little deeper to see if maybe he was purging who he follows as a whole. Nope. He only unfollowed me out of every mutual person I could think of. I\u2019m too embarrassed to ask any of our friends because he only unfollowed me. The reason I\u2019ve decided to post this is because he\u2019s been in a few of my dreams lately and the whole situation is kind of weighing me down. I hate the thought of someone being upset with me or hating me without knowing.  I consider him a life long friend, but it seems like there\u2019s an underlying reason he unfollowed my account that I\u2019m just not aware of. Any insight from an outsider is much appreciated! Just having someone to talk to about it might ease my mind.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I've found myself in a bit of an odd situation friendship wise and don\u2019t really know what to make of it or how to proceed.\n\nI live in a small village, about 2000 people, and have lost touch with my school friends, I never had a great deal of friends at school and was never the most popular, in fact I would probably say I was kind of bullied and my confidence has been rock bottom for years. After high school ended I completely lost touch with the people I went to school with and now don\u2019t really talk to any of them, apart from the odd \"Hi\" in the street. At university I never really became friends with any of my class mates and mostly kept myself to myself. Since graduating if kind of felt like a loner with no one to talk to or hang out with, I feel as though I have wasted my youth.\n\nOne person I have always kept in contact with throughout the years in my cousin who lives about 40 miles away, about an hour away. We mostly talk online almost every day or via text message etc and have played videogames online for years. This is where I got most of my social interaction, it sad but true. He obviously has his own friends from school etc whom he is quite close to and has since introduced me to some of them. Over the past couple of years via messaging groups etc and online chat and games I have got to know some of them and consider them friends as well. I've slowly been building my confidence back up and have met up with them a few times to go the cinema or out drinking etc.\n\nHowever recently I don\u2019t really know if I should be part of this friendship group or if they even consider me a friend or just an \"online friend\". They are obviously part of other friendship groups with their own school friends and talk to them, which of course they are fully entitled to, but I just can\u2019t help but feel left out sometimes. I feel as though they are not interested in talking to me about normal things e.g. Work, jobs, relationships etc and only consider me someone to play games with during the week. At weekends and stuff, they go out with their other friends and don\u2019t really invite me along, (I'm not expecting to be invited to everything, but maybe even one or two). I know the distance thing is a potential barrier but getting up and down to the city is no problem for me via train, in fact if I organise a night out then they are happy to come, but only when I invite them.\n\nI don\u2019t want to come across as selfish, I really like these guys and they have helped me become a more confidant and outgoing person, something which I can\u2019t thank them enough for. I just don\u2019t know what to make of the situation or how to proceed. Should I look for work in the city so I can be closer and hang out more or should I take some time to think about the situation?\n\nPlease help any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Now that I\u2019ve made it out, I\u2019d like to make more friends! After everything tough that basic training threw my way, I\u2019ve come to learn not to take kind people and things for granted, because there wasn\u2019t much of either at basic... To say the least. It\u2019s been almost a month since then, so I\u2019d say I\u2019m well adjusted to being more relaxed now.\n\nBut anyway, I figure why not introduce myself? I\u2019m 21, and I\u2019m an optimist so I try to laugh and smile a lot.

Memes, my guys, is something I bond with people over. Don\u2019t be afraid to show me offensive ones, but also don\u2019t be afraid of showing me even mild ones.

Because I hardly ever shut up when I feel connected to someone, when I feel that click, I just open right up!\n\nLet me know if something is bothering you though. I will become serious very quickly, and will hear out what\u2019s troubling you. I always take the struggles of my friends seriously. I can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll always be able to help, but I can promise I\u2019ll always listen and, to the best of my ability, be a kind voice to reassure you.\n\nI apologize if I\u2019m ever unable to respond or message back.

I am drawn to things that keep me intellectually engaged and I like thinking deeply about almost anything. My native language is sarcasm. I play video games occasionally, but mostly more retro stuff. I enjoy sports and certain parts of nerd culture. I love learning things so if you have an expertise you want to teach me, please do so. \n\nAnyways, hit me up, drop me a line, whatever you prefer.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

My mother would keep me up at night telling me how she \"wished that I was an orphan.\" and that she \"fucking hated me\".

I wanted to make a post asking for help witha situation me and my gf have.\nSome backstory information you might need to fully understand the situation is that my gf has been struggling with depression and don't have a lot of friends where we live now. I recently started at a new school (been here like 3 months), and our current friend group consists of 4 main people, us included. \n\nI usually go to school every day, and sit next to my two friends. My gf also joins even though she doesn't go to that school, but it's just lectures in front of a big class (like a cinema, with 1 tutor and like 200 students), so no one will know if she goes there or not. We also have a group project, and my gf joins in there too because she doesn't want to feel left out, and everyone thinks it's just fun to have her there, so it works out.\n\nBut, we have 1 class where she can't join, because only like 40 students attend and people know eachother. So she either has to wait at home, or outside the classroom while we are inside. Sometimes i go to this class 5 minutes early, but I and our friends always go out to talk with her during the 15 minutes break we get. Sometimes we might also go a little early back to class.\n\nHer perspective of this is that she is being left out, and it's unfair that we (or actually more me), go back to class even though we have like 5 more minutes of our break.\n\nMy perspective is that this is unfair. I do everything I can to make her feel included, but I don't want to feel rushed when this one class starts. I have to find a seat, preferably 3 open seats so me and my 2 other friends can sit next to eachother. I have to unpack my backpack, put my charger in a wall connect it to my PC. I don't want to do this while my teacher is already talking / has started his lecture. But anyways, the 15 minute break we sometimes also go back a little before the break is over. Not much, only a few minutes. But she thinks this is really unfair of me, and it can ruin the whole day for her. \n\nSo yeah, that's our situation and idk what to do about it.

I plan on going to a state school an hour away for a specialized program they have. \n\nThese girls I have known since 8th grade, so we are close. I have planned years of birthday parties that everyone dropped out of the day of. No one even bothered to tell me that they weren't coming to my 16th, so I stopped planning anything.

They will interrupt me, make it obvious they weren't listening, and start new conversations over me talking. \n\nI feel like I can't be myself around them, and like they only keep me around for some ulterior purpose (I've yet to find out what though).

She does not have a good relationship with her parents and will just not talk to them for months on end while living in their basement. She wants to move out and get a new job so I\u2019ve been trying to help her with her resume. I spent 4 hours laying out exactly what needed to be done with her and making her a step by step plan broken town into tiny chunks on how to achieve it. It\u2019s now been over 3 weeks and despite my check ins she has done nothing just because she\u2019s been tired (She finishes work at 3:30 and does nothing from then until she goes to sleep at midnight). She lacks basic life skills and when I make an effort to teach her or provide resources she doesn\u2019t want to learn or says she\u2019s already tried. This includes things like making change with money, basic addition and subtraction, telling time with an analogue clock, basic computer skills (managing an email account, excel, anything formatting related in word, powerpoint, driving any cooking). She won\u2019t clean at all and I honestly worry that she has a hoarding problem. \n\nThe cleaning issue is one of the reasons that she has a bad relationship with her parents. They want her to keep her space reasonably tidy and she won\u2019t. She leaves clothes everywhere, she leaves dirty plates and containers of rotting food everywhere. When her mom got sick of it and came down and cleaned when she was at work, the girl got so angry at her for disrupting her space. \n\nI\u2019m at the end of my rope.

It was made up of G\u2019s friends all of them went to the same elementary school, while J spent her Kindergarten year there, and then came to my school.  I didn\u2019t really talk to any of the other people at the table except a gay FTM trans kid that will call K. He was in my gym and I did not know a lot of people in our gym because I wasn\u2019t that social in our JR high until 8th and even then I had almost the same exact people in all my classes, so I talked to K. Now a few weeks forward a girl will call H came to our table. She had been in a class of mine last year but we didn\u2019t talk, and now is in 3 of my classes this year. H is a vegetarian and is very rude but will not say anything face. Ever since H had come over K was getting ruder, for instance, I\u2019m in MCJROTC along with G and J and K kept saying that they have orgies in the program. I finally got fed up with him and got into an argument with him. I\u2019ve had 2 brothers in the program simultaneously and I was the last one to be in it. I know my older brothers wouldn\u2019t have let me join if that were it. I asked him where he got this info and he said from a friend who heard from a friend from someone who is known to lie in the program. I said so it isn\u2019t true, and then he responded with no. Every time I brought something valid he would ignore me and tell me to shut up.  The next thing is I\u2019m the only person in our friend group that is not in LGBTQ+. I\u2019m straight. I went from being BI to Asexual to Straight. K likes to tell me though that I\u2019m a lesbian and I just won\u2019t say it. I have repeatedly told him to stop saying that. Another thing is my parents are not rich but Aren\u2019t poor. K always talks about how he doesn\u2019t have enough money to get groceries, so I gave him some money because I knew how it felt to be in a situation where you were struggling to pay for things. He said I was Sugar Daddy I went along with it, thinking it was a joke, now I get him asking me for money, and when I say no he says I\u2019m a bad sugar daddy and that I owe him that money or the thing he wants because I have money. The thing causes me to not even want to eat at lunch is H. I eat whatever the school has because it\u2019s free. She eats pizza every day and glares at J and me when we eat. I thought it was just me and I was crazy because I kept feeling uncomfortable when eating and she sits right beside me.  I was texting yesterday and she said she could feel her glaring too. The only reason I could think of she is vegetarian and school lunches have meat. She herself brought a friend to our table and I had seen orange cream milk and was interested and got it. I sat down at our table and took a sip; J and G asked how it tasted, and I didn\u2019t know to describe so I let G have a taste. H then put her hand to her mouth and plainly whispered about G and me in front of our faces. Lastly, K has a crush on a boy who will call C. Instead of talking to C like a normal person, K stalks him and takes pictures of him while he isn\u2019t looking. His therapist told him to delete the photos and thankfully he did. I had found C Instagram and told K. K proceeded to yell at me to give them my phone. I said no. So H looked over my shoulder to get the username, and I had told him it which I knew wasn\u2019t a good idea. K still wanted my phone. I have an iPhone XR and I know they're expensive, so I only let people I trust touch it. K\u2019s and I\u2019s friendship was going through the window by now, so I wasn\u2019t letting him touch it. K then took my phone and got Instagram. I was talking to J last night and we both don\u2019t want them sitting at the table because of all of this.

We have fun deep convos sometimes about this and that. \n\nThe issue is recently (last month or two) he\u2019s been acting really different but Idk if that\u2019s just who he really is or not. He quit his job at subway very suddenly and didn\u2019t get a new job but went on unemployment. He\u2019s been acting like he can\u2019t just go get another job, so he\u2019s on unemployment and wanting to go back into the software field he was in years before. I admire his desire to get into a career he cares about. I don\u2019t even want to criticize this choices here because if he does get a job in that field I\u2019ll be really proud of him. \n\nThing is he\u2019s just been acting very disconnected and I feel offended a lot of the time we hang out now because I don\u2019t feel like he cares that I\u2019m there at all. He just wants someone to express all his little things to but cuts me off when I try getting into more detail about anything I want to talk about so I only pick topics that I can get a conversation or a reaction from the surface level of that topic. \n\nHe\u2019s was kinda doing this with playing guitar for a while, right after he quit subway he started talking about music and all the stuff involved with it non-stop to the point where I verbally told him please change the topic. Any topic gets super old and annoying to hear about when it\u2019s all someone talks about and then overrides what you want to talk about with what you were obviously trying to change the topic on. Now to be fair I\u2019m horrible at any instrument I don\u2019t play any music. I\u2019m actually not interested in it very much at all yet I do love music I love sharing music and talking about music. But after so many days in and out of this it starts to feel very abrasive because he knows him bad at music but he\u2019s always bragging on about how good he sounds to himself. I just want to tell him to shut the fuck up sometimes but I don\u2019t feel like I have any right to. So I\u2019ve just been going to see him less and less.\n\nHe\u2019s had some drug use problems and I think he\u2019s on meth. I don\u2019t just think that I know that it\u2019s just I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s on it when we hang out or not. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be someone to be using everyday and it seems like he\u2019s acting like this every day.\n\nLast time I was over he snapped at his dad in front of me over minute stuff. He\u2019s gotten really into trying to optimize his phone, and his laptop, then his dads computer and his dad got annoyed because he\u2019s really doing nothing to it besides finding a hundred reasons to improve on something that works 100% fine and his dad wanted his computer back. Anyways that made me comfortable and it kinda reflected how he\u2019s been annoying me too. Just getting obsessed with really meaningless piddling tasks and acting like he\u2019s doing everyone such a huge favor when really he\u2019s just doing nothing with his life and he\u2019s filling his time with productivity porn. \n\nAny advice? He\u2019s a great guy, I\u2019m just worried the drugs are making him get into super one track mind states for days at a time and his obsessive nature is causing him to become really short and uninterested with other people so he comes off super abrasive. \n\nThanks", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We've been best friends since middle school. We helped each other through so much and I don't think I would've been able to get through so much if it wasn't for her. She's a year older so she started college a year before me and ever since I feel like she's completely changed. She's not the same loving, compassionate person that I once knew. The way she texts me is condescending- like I'm a child- and she's always judging me for not drinking alcohol now that I'm in college (personal choice and it isn't legal here anyway). She never wants to talk on the phone either and always has an excuse for why (most of these excuses aren't reasonable). She was such a big part of me growing up- we made the best memories and have told each other so much. I would hate for us to continue to fade apart. She takes so much time to text me back and when she does, it's just a few words. I feel like she just doesn't care anymore. Any advice?", "subreddit": "friendship"}

There's always an infinite amount of possibilities to how you can decide to phrase something. Those little details are what keeps me going. I'm a pretty emotional person so sometimes I get stuck on some of them. It makes saying Goodbye especially hard and can lead me to be someone I don't like or plainly a bad person. I don't quite get how you're supposed to move on when you know it's all your fault. In a world where I would've stayed myself, I'd still be talking with her. It's weird to me. Like I can't get over some of the things I saw. It's so weird to know what is the right thing to do and still feeling like the right choice is wrong.

We were always there for each other, we always hung out, and we were really close. I could talk to him about anything. One day, he just left me because he didn\u2019t want to talk anymore. He blocked me on everything, including my number. I cried and tried to get other people to talk to him for me. He told me I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but he didn\u2019t want to talk to me. One of my friends showed me the conversation they had and he said that he had nothing against me, but he said that we grew apart and he didn\u2019t want to be my friend. We did have a conversation together (me and the friend that cut me off) only because I wanted answers. He told me that he didn\u2019t enjoy talking to me. After that, we wished each other well, but I texted him again asking how long he wanted to stop being friends with me. He told me awhile and then told me to leave him alone or he would block me. Eventually he did block my number again because I asked one of his friends something and she asked him what was going on. I felt quite ashamed of myself later on because I was basically using my friends as comforters and I didn\u2019t realize I wasn\u2019t considering anyone\u2019s feelings until one of my good friends left me because she had enough. My brother talked to the friend that cut me off and he told him that he already told me why he didn\u2019t want to talk to me anymore, but I didn\u2019t listen. He told my brother that I\u2019m a good kid and he didn\u2019t hate me. He has a girlfriend now and he\u2019s happy without me. I want to hope that we will be friends again one day, but I also just want to fix things right away. I don\u2019t want to think that all of the love is lost, but I don\u2019t really know what to think anymore. I made a lot of promises with him and I thought we would be best friends forever.
