Sometimes to the point where I think I must be a sociopath or something, because nothing invokes real emotion from me if it doesn\u2019t effect me directly. I feel like when I react to things, I\u2019m preforming how I think other people would react. Like when something sad happens, I cry because other people are crying, not because I\u2019m sad. I\u2019m not happy, but I just feel indifferent towards the situation. Same thing with happy things. I\u2019m have bipolar disorder, and I originally thought the diagnosis would help. But after a year of knowing and trying out different meds that promise to fix me but only seem to make me worse- I don\u2019t feel that way anymore. I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m trying to say but I just wanted to get this off my chest.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

We'd meet every single day and it'd be weird if we didn't. We used to meet for most the evening, split for a couple hrs, spend hours of the night together. Nothing weird or gay, we were just best-friends. \n\nThe last month has been totally different. Without an argument or anything, we have met probably only once a week this month. He seems to have flaked on me a couple times, like today for example he came to my house \"trick-or-treating\" with his GF's daughter and it was a bit awkward considering we hardly spoke at all this week. Infact, we did not speak at all this week, no text, FB or meeting. He said he would hit me up later and we'd have a mad night. Guess what? No contact, at all. I don't want to contact his as I don't want to be the \"needy\" one. He'sletme down, not the other way round.\n\nIt drives me so crazy. We've been through so much together, more than most I'd say. Yes, he has a GF but even in the last year since he's been with her we still met soooo often. I'd rather not be friends at all in this situation than be called upon only when he wants to use me. Like when he needs a favour, which is what happened when we last met.\n\nHe has over $400 of my money and a lot of my stuff totalling another couple of hundred. I'd rather say screw you, keep the money and the stuff. My problem is that he's my only friend. Cutting contact might be hard on me. I do work a lot though and live with family so wouldn't call myself lonely. Do I need to get myself a GF?!?!\n\nSeriously, how would you go about it? I really want to end the friendship but don't even know how. There's so much more I want to say, maybe I need a therapist instead of boring all you redditors :(", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I don't blame them, I know it was too much for what was originally a more light hearted conversation partner, but it hurt.\n\nI wanted to scream, I had a tightness in my chest that made me want to give up. It's a hard feeling to deal with, as I can't talk to the person, ask for forgiveness or try to explain myself. I wasn't able to talk to anyone else about it either. When my brother noticed that I looked down I lied and said I was tired.\n\nLuckily, this isn't the first time I have had this feeling and I knew how to make it better, in a way. I went on a long (almost 2 hour) bike ride despite the cold. I just kept peddling, actually going at the highest consistent speed of my rides so far, and forced myself not to keep checking my phone. (only mild success)\n\nAt times like this there's nothing to make it better. I can't change what happened, I can't try again, I have to deal with the reality and that is that. Accept it, learn, and move on. It sucks, I messed up, and it hurts. Now I have to keep going.\n\nThe good news is that I was able to identify what has been stressing me out in the rant I made, so I now have a list of things I need to work on. Bright side. :)\n\nIf you are open to hearing some of my problems, I'd appreciate it, though to be honest I might have a hard time sharing.

Made a lot of bad decisions, tried to get with the wrong people. I have always felt lonely, I sometimes cry because I'm so lonely, I never knew what it was like to have a real friend, you know? \n\nAnyways, I am a little opinionated, Im not very smart but I have a few topics I love to the extreme. I love researching and educating more and more about those few topics. I absolutely love dogs and other pets. I'm such a huge advocate for the proper care and handling of them. I'm pretty adventurous, I love hiking and exploring, I just really like nature. I also really love games like Undertale and Zelda that have a lot of immersion and lore, ever since I picked up Twilight Princess in 2010 I've been a huge fan. I also love Pokemon, my favorite is Kecleon. I used to play Black Desert and I loved it but my laptop couldn't handle it and would crash all the time. I can't afford a better computer but I love pc gaming :( \n\nI used to collect all kinds of gaming and anime stuff, but I had to sell it all to move and haven't been able to start a collection again. I play magic but don't have anyone to play against though, Im to anxious to go to the local game shop haha. I'm also a furry, if that's cool. I have a fursona and I love her so much, she looks like a big huggable stuffed toy. I'm not sure why I'm posting, I can't hold a conversation but I'm happy to talk.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

We\u2019re all of similar ages so that\u2019s great too. After working there for a while, I got given the opportunity to work my dream job (being a filmmaker working abroad) this meant me having to travel and be out of my home country for at least 6 months out of the year. To my surprise, my work at home decided they didn\u2019t want me to go and asked me if I\u2019d still stay and work over the winter when I came back home. I didn\u2019t want to pass this as if already made so many great friends with all the staff including the managers, so I didn\u2019t want to let them down. \n\nFlash forward to the first month away, everything\u2019s going well I\u2019m still talking to the guys back home we\u2019re just chatting general shit about Netflix, work back home, work gossip you name it we have a group chat so it\u2019s easy to keep in touch. I still keep in touch with the odd person that I\u2019d chat to in our own chat, I\u2019d give them advice, they\u2019d give me advice, we\u2019d just talk crap you know, the normal friend stuff.\n\nBut then a few months go by and the messages became either here not there. I\u2019m still trying to keep in touch because I feel these are some of the first people I\u2019d consider as friends, even outside of work we would hang out. Now, I don\u2019t hound them with messages, I know they\u2019re busy.. they\u2019re still talking to each other on the group chat no problem. Yet I\u2019m getting ignored on it.. they all know I\u2019m coming back and every message I send just gets read and ignored.. it kinda hurts. So I message one of my friends outside the group.. and the same happens :/ I used to tag her in memes on Facebook and she\u2019d ALWAYS comment back, not anymore I don\u2019t even get a like (but she\u2019s seen it because I\u2019ve seen her share it after I tag her), I\u2019ll comment a relevant comment on her post and it won\u2019t even get a response. Even when asking important questions in the group chat such as asking when they want me to come back, I still get ignored.\n\nI\u2019m a little worried because the end of the season is coming and I\u2019m due to go back home in a couple of days but that means a week after I get home I have to go back to work there (the new manager called me and informed me of this) and I\u2019m really nervous. I\u2019m quite an introverted person so I just can\u2019t help feeling I\u2019m going to get there and everyone will ignore me but this time in person\n\nI just can\u2019t understand why she would ignore me, or why they are doing.

Trying to provide some detail and context without providing too much. Names changed.\n\nSo I became friends with Amy who I met while traveling. By coincidence, I ended up moving to where Amy was living and I knew very few people besides Amy. We hung out a bunch and got closer and closer over time. I felt like we became very good friends and got to know each other very well very quickly. Eventually, I decided to open up to Amy about some very personal issues which they initially seemed responsive and supportive to, though the topic never really popped up since. Time went on and the friendship seemed just fine. Later, I met Amy\u2019s friend Betty at a party, who became a mutual friend. I ended up hanging out with Betty without Amy on occasion. Time went on and all was just fine! Later (and randomly), Amy stopped responding to me and eventually said they needed some space. At first I wasn\u2019t sure if it was related to me or something had happened to them, but eventually confirmed it was me, and they basically (suddenly) didn\u2019t want to be friends anymore. At my request we eventually got together to \u201ctalk\u201d, though it seems like they just wanted me to do most of the talking when I was the one seeking answers. I feel like I got very little details apart from generalities and just feeling like our personalities didn\u2019t align. I feel there\u2019s more to it, and maybe it\u2019s related to some of the issues I opened up to them about, but they said it wasn\u2019t. It ended with virtually zero closure for me. I find it very odd that two people would be friends and then seemingly overnight one person just decides they don\u2019t want to be friends anymore. If there WAS an issue, I would expect a more reasonable approach to be along the lines of \u201cI really hate when you do X\u201d or similar. Never experienced something quite like this...\n\nP.S. When I think about this, it feels like awkward school-age drama, but sadly we\u2019re all adults\n\nAt this point, so much time has passed that I don\u2019t hold out any hope for any repair to the friendship with Amy\u2026 but more importantly I\u2019m not sure how to handle/approach the friendship with Betty\u2026 It feels in a very weird state of limbo to me.\n\n* I feel hurt and a massive lack of closure with Amy. Given how I opened up to them about some personal issues, I feel very betrayed and it\u2019s given me some fresh trust issues and I feel very much on guard these days.\n* Being new-ish to the city I virtually have nobody to confide in about my issues... ironically, Betty would normally be one of those people\n* My gut tells me that Amy has spoken to Betty to some degree about our falling out, and I sense that Amy has shared more than she should have, but I can\u2019t be sure. I have tried to specifically not ask Betty, but it she has indicated that Amy didn\u2019t really say anything to her but knows that Betty and I still hang out.\n* I get angry and sad when I know that Amy and Betty still hang out. I know they were friends first, but given how hurt and betrayed I feel by Amy\u2026 it hurts even more that Betty chooses to hang out with them. At the same time it feels unreasonable to expect Betty to stop being friends with Amy...\n* When I do hang out with Betty, sometimes just through casual conversation Amy comes up and it\u2019s really annoying because of the same reasons above. I\u2019d rather be able to forget about Amy - \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d which is far easier with any of my other friends\u2026 but not with Betty.\n\nSo\u2026 yeah. Help!

It felt like we had a connection immediately. We talked back-and-forth and she complimented my rhetorical skills and vocabulary; I expressed similar high regard in return. We started messaging back-and-forth over Instagram DMs. Earlier this week we had another encounter at a club meeting, and we really connected this time around. We spent hours on Tuesday and Wednesday nights chatting. We heaped praise on each other and expressed mutual enjoyment of each other\u2019s (virtual) presence. We made preliminary plans to hang out in real life outside of the club meetings. Thursday arrives. I had sent her a message the previous night and received no reply. I checked my phone at school and saw a message from around 8 o\u2019clock in reply. Ok. All good. I then messaged her back and waited. She was embarking on a 9-hour car ride to the northern part of the state we live in. Perfect time to have a conversation, surely! I get out of school at 3:30. No reply. I start to get a sick feeling in my stomach. This friend was normally a fairly speedy replier. Hours pass. No reply. I go to bed at 9 PM feeling like shit. I woke up today expecting something, anything. An explanation, an apology, perhaps. So far today I have continued to receive radio silence. They have posted on their Instagram story and viewed my Instagram story. Still nothing. This is incredibly painful considering the closeness that we developed in such a small time frame.

Around September. He broke up with me. Due to his problems and depression. I was okay after a week and sometimes i tear up here and there. I txted him last night and said \u201chappy Halloween \ud83c\udf83love you\u201d and he txted me back \u201c happy Halloween I love you two\u201d it made me feel a bit better but nothing crazy. So long story short. I\u2019m a small town girl that moved in a big city with no friends. I have a big pet peeve of work and friends. But i made friends and work. My two best friend / coworkers  Julie and Diana and I went to Hawaii where my sister lives and the group trips didn\u2019t work out as we thought. Diana and I don\u2019t talk no more we try to work it out but it\u2019s never the same. Work is awkward at times. But I don\u2019t make it awkward. I\u2019m seriously the person to forgive and move on. But you just know there is tension. I miss how things were but how can I work with coworker that doesn\u2019t want to  talk to me or want to resolve this?  she was my best friend and the person to relate. Julie was a different race that couldn\u2019t relate at all unless it was girl stuff you know? Diana and I were super close to the point I went on family trips with her family and I stopped by to say hi to her kid and husband. I\u2019m sad that we are not talk but it is how it is. I\u2019m just more upset of Julie that i helped her fix her friendship with her childhood best friend amber . But when we needed her to help us she didn\u2019t even bother. I still talk to her but it the same but eh a tad bit different.  \n\nOh I forgot to say . I moved in the big city with my best friend Julissa from middle school .It was awesome she was like my sister and never had so much fun in my life. Long story short . During Christmas and New Years of last year we had a miscommunication and disagreement.  It was about my best friend Emilio. He was coming from the Army and he needed a place to crash and I offered my house. I picked him up and the airport and I felt like high school again. Well just like old time sakes. I was the person to check on him and I was there from the beginning from his deployment and almost to the end. Julissa was head over heels of him and i understood there chemistry. I was bothered to be honest because he was my best friend since high school and I\u2019m the one that was always checking on him and helping him with his depression when things went south up in Afganist\u00e1n. Julissa just meet him once and doesn\u2019t know nothing about him. So I was more bothered that she was all I\u2019ve him and I just wanted quality time with him. ( no I didn\u2019t like him like a boyfriend) so once he was going to go back up to Alaska (where he is stationed)  I was suppose to take him. Julissa took him. I was upset because when he was here Julissa and Emilio were together all the time. I barley had anytime with him.  I was super upset because I\u2019ve known this kid forever and Julissa barley knows him. Couple months later like around March. Out lease was going to end. I was out of town and the land lord . Came to pick up the lease . She signed the lease to renew and it beg to differ she signed it under her name and  eventually kicked me out. My middle school best friend and I were no long friends .\n\nJulissa And Emilio are now married and have a baby on the way. I couldn\u2019t be any happier. \n\n\nSo long story short. \nI am alone in a big city with no friends . I\u2019m acting up and doing this that I don\u2019t do  normally, I try by best to make friends but .... it just doesn\u2019t work.  I\u2019m sad and I cry at work sometimes  and I stay in my unit. I lost \n\nMy boyfriend . Diana . Julissa . Emilio . \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do . I just wish things were different so I don\u2019t feel so alone. \n\n\nSorry for the long vent but i felt at ease writing it . Thanks for reading.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I have quite a large friend group and we all get along very well, but recently tensions have been brewing. A couple months ago a few of my friends thought it would be fun to try MD, so they did. I didn't think much of it as it's quite common for people my age where I live. But when they got high they all got really rude, shutting themselves away in a room and not letting anyone speak to them. Thought it was quite deep but just moved on. \n\nSoon they progressed to doing it with more frequency and started going to these drug-fuelled raves at the weekend. Sounded fun so I said I wanted to go but they told me not to: \"It's not somewhere you go when you're drunk\". I thought okay, quite rude, but just moved on. Not long after, whenever we met up as a group the 'Ket gang', as we now called them, started leaving to go do ket by themselves or go off to a rave. Effectively just isolating themselves from everyone else, people they were meant to be close friends with. \n\nThe most vexing part of this for me is that now (in my opinion) they see themselves as super prestige, looking down on people who only drink. Acting as if they're better than everyone else. This change has happened so fast and I don't like the people they've become. I can see us drifting apart. I still want to be friends with them but this whole situation has made me start to hate them. \n\nI realised I probably explained the whole situation badly but I hope you can still get the gist of it.\n\nTL;DR\nFriends started doing MD, now they think they're too cool for the rest of us.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I\u2019m Vince, today is my 19th birthday and I was hoping by chance that would somehow make me feel better but I guess not. I tried to remain as upbeat as possible to help as many people struggling as I can hoping it would give me purpose but it\u2019s clawed away at my own self worth. From witnessing domestic abuse at age 7, learning of my girlfriend cheating on me with my best friend at age 16, then right after losing my home and my family turning their back on me, getting scammed at an old apartment where mold destroyed every last piece of my furniture, my belongings, instruments, I tried to kill myself, it didn\u2019t work, I was hospitalized for 8 days as a result, sleeping in a car as winter edged near in New York City, staying with my extended family who have ties with the mafia, the abuse, but I had no other choice, I had nowhere else to go, an instant aunt, drugs had a hold on her and she attacked me too, I had nowhere to turn, every day gets harder and harder, people who know me can claim I\u2019m strong, but after so much fighting I can\u2019t fight anymore. Getting cheated on twice, beatings, losing all of my belongings, my family turning on me, hospitalization, scraping together money to get into a small apartment but losing all of my friends after my own best friend turned them on me. I have nothing left. I stumbled upon this sub reddit and saw some success stories, and I\u2019m thankful to all of those men and women who truly care about making new friends, I tried it out but it seems I didn\u2019t have any luck with that either, I don\u2019t think I can push anymore. When you see somebody looking for a friend, I encourage you to reach out to them and hopefully you both improve each other in the process. I\u2019m using this throwaway because I\u2019m too afraid of any of them learning I\u2019ve talked about this. Anyway, if you\u2019ve taken the time to read this thank you. The pain has just been too much to bear over the course of these years and I\u2019ve never talked about it, the men from my family taught me not to do that, because people would only be friends with me out of pity that way.

I've never had any kind of online relationship before. I always found it easier to talk to people irl than online even though you mostly hear about the opposite case. I'm a habitual lurker, preferring to hang around and simply watch online communities rather than engage with them. My life is in a bit of a rough patch at the moment. Most people I talked to regularly before have sort of drifted away. I know this kind of thing happens, but I feel it's partially my fault as I failed to consistently reach out. That's the real hard part of friendships. Making them is easy, but keeping them going is more difficult. So I'm reaching out here in the hopes of gaining a new friend and getting over my strange and irrational fear of pure online communication. Taking a shot in the dark as some might say.\n\nI'm a male, 23, hail from the west coast USA, and  am currently unemployed so I have too much time on my hands. I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Bioengineering, but finding employment in that field has been... difficult. My hobbies mostly include video games and music. I enjoy a large variety of games, but I suppose RPGs are my favorite genre (as vague as that term means nowadays). I don't play multiplayer games often as my computer is a POS and my internet isn't the greatest either so my options are limited there. As for music I listen to quite a bit of Alternative Rock, Vaporwave, and Video Game OSTs. I listen to a variety of other stuff in smaller amounts as well though. Some prog rock, some city pop, some downtempo, etc. I'm always looking for new stuff to listen to, so if you have suggestions, I'd love to hear them. I don't watch a lot of movies or TV, but I do watch the occasional anime. I tend to read the mangas more often though. \n\nI also suffer from Crohn's disease, so prepare to hear some griping about that. I feel I can handle any kind of difficult subject matter but we'll see. Anyone of any background is welcome to message me if any of the above interests.

I'm a medical doctor. Although I'm just a humble GP. Don't expect much from me. \ud83d\ude05\n\n-- I play the piano and the guitar. Mostly anime / game / movie theme songs on the piano, then alternative songs I want to sing along to on the guitar.\n\n-- Yep, I watch anime and I read manga. For anime, currently watching Boku No Hero and Cells at Work. For manga, currently reader Black Clover and The Gamer.\n\n-- I like playing video games. Like a lot. Mostly what consumes my gaming time as of late is Dota 2. But I'm really a single player RPG kind of guy: Fallout, Witcher, Metal Gear, Borderlands, Bioshock, things like that. I am also into RTS, Starcraft and Crusader Kings, mainly.\n\n-- Yeah, I'm big into music. At least once a week, I make it a point to be alone while listening to music and just spacing out. Usually I listen to classical while I do this: Beethoven's Symphony no. 7 is a favourite, although I won't refuse some Wagner, Holtz, or Bach. For more modern choices, I tend to go the alternative route: Twentyone Pilots, Muse, Owl City, The Postal Service, Bastille. I also listen to older stuff: Elton John, Billy Joel, James Taylor, John Denver. I also listen to non-English ones. A bit of Kraftklub and OK Kid (German), Hedgehog (Chinese), and for my music quirk, Psy. \ud83d\ude05\n\n-- Yep, I speak other languages, too, should you prefer. I speak Mandarin Chinese, Min Nan Chinese, Filipino, and a bit of German.\n\n-- I like stories. They allow me to be in places I couldn't afford to be. Fiction, whether in film or print, is awesome. Favourite director has to be Nolan. Favourite Author, Grisham.\n\n-- I like talking about many different things, except two topics: Religion and Politics. We can talk about political philosophy, or belief philosophy (existentialism, theodicy, take your pick), just not religion and current politics. Those conversations get weird eventually.\n\nThat's about it.

We might be able to voice chat, who knows? And no, I will probably not be showing you my face. Even on the internet, I'd like a bit of privacy.\n\nI'm waiting on my pre-uni intake atm (it's all the way in February, smh). Can't wait to do another whole 9-month gap before starting uni proper. In other words, I've got quite some time before I have to make friends irl. I might not be much of an extrovert, but cooping yourself up in your bedroom for nearly half a year really does things to you.\n\nEnough of the nitty-gritty though. If you wanna strike up a convo, I really like reading (novels in random time spikes). I read manga and webtoons more so than novels since they're sort of a chapter-by-week thing. My favourite novel is *Lolita,* no question, and I think *A Cruel God Reigns* and *Wolf Children* are probably some of my favourite manga. *Aku no Hana* started off reaaally strong, but I disliked the resolution. I don't like most webtoons, but if I had to choose one it'd probably be *Melvina's Therapy*... I really do sound like I'm out of some edgy starter pack.\n\nI have a Switch! The AAA games I own are *BotW, Splatoon 2, Mario Odyssey,* aaand *Three Houses.* I think that's it? The rest of my library is a bunch of indie games I bought for maybe a dollar to fifteen.\n\nI fricking (trying not to swear, ok) love YouTube drama. My mom says it's not good to absorb bad energy or whatever, but I can do what I want, mom. Plus, I don't think it's inherently bad to follow people like Dani Cohn or Onision (one is muuuch worse than the other). I think it's bad if you go out of your way to harrass them, but I don't do that.\n\nOh, and I love hate-watching films like *Tall Girl* and *The Kissing Booth.* If ever you wanna hate-watch a film with someone, hmu. I need more people to laugh at dumb shit like this with. You know how lonely it's been the past 4 months, to laugh alone? Hate-watching isn't the same without someone else there.\n\nI also like listening to music (who doesn't), though it's mostly classical (idc if you think it's boring, Khachaturian put out fucking *bops*), Japanese alt-rock/pop/electronic, and video game soundtracks. Speaking of video game soundtracks, I've been listening to the *Persona 4* and *Celeste* soundtracks a lot lately. My favourite composer's Koji Kondo, but you don't have a lot to work with after *Ocarina*. I feel like he mostly supervises now.\n\nAnyway, this post is actually obnoxiously long now.

As I got out of the supermarket, this bend little lady that was probably in her 30s but looked like she was approaching 50 came on to me. Her eyes wide open as she asked me whether I have a wallet. I don't know where she is from but with a peal of subtle laughter, I reply &gt;&gt;Yes&lt;&lt; (since I don't know a single person that doesn't have a wallet and I already know where this conversation is heading). She then proceeds to ask me whether I can look into it, to see if there is something I can give her; as I just came out of the supermarket I spend all my cash and only had 2\u20ac left, so I tell her &gt;&gt;no&lt;&lt;; but I didn't just tell her no because I only had 2\u20ac, I could have given it to her without backlash or financial crisis. However, I thought about begging and at that moment I felt like begging is miserable, the worst form of acquiring money. I rather have her knocking me out with a baseball bat or threaten me with money or my life than to beg for money. She proceeded to ask a few more times saying  &gt;&gt;please, I am already dancing&lt;&lt;; it wasn't really a dance she just humped up and down as if she was freezing. I told her that the dance wasn't good enough and that I have no money and we parted.

{"post_id": "dqlx79", "created_utc": 1572709537, "title": "15M Starting an intellectual community!", "author": "blacklight913", "self_text": " Hey, I\u2019m a 15 (almost 16) year old male and I\u2019m looking for people (preferably in Europe, or around GMT +1) that are interested in joining an intellectual community. The optimum age range is between 14 and 22 years.\n\nMy goal is to make a small group for (highly) intelligent, driven, disciplined, motivated and ambitious people. A group for brainstorming, sharing art, music, holding deep conversations, ect.\n\nI was thinking about why so many people today are depressive and are so negative, and are just strolling through life without a purpose. Since I feel completely the opposite way, it made me wonder: \u2018Why?\u2019. It made me think of my habits, lifestyle and through which kind of 'lens' I'm seeing the world. This led me to the fields of Biology, Neuroscience, Philosophy, Psychology, Religion.\n\nAnd over time that idea has evolved into making a philosophy that not only helps those with high intelligence and talent, but everyone that wants to improve him/herself and people that are lost in life, depressive, weak, ect.\n\nTogether in our community we will build a philosophy that I\u2019ll explain down below:\n\nThe main philosophy:  \nWe believe that everything inside our bodies is intertwined. Our physical health influences our mental health and vice versa. We want to merge sciences in to one great and universal philosophy and we want to make a 'new way of life' that not improves our mental and physical health, but also improves our cognitive abilities, happiness, productiveness, and gives techniques on how to apply that philosophy. The philosophy is to some extent materialistic and promotes the amassing of wealth.\n\nRather than do what most philosophies today preach (avoid suffering, \u2018negative emotions\u2019 and whatnot), we should use and manipulate our emotions to improve ourselves. Using everything in our arsenal instead of a small and limited part in order to achieve what we want.\n\nWe should use our internal biological systems like our internal reward system, the changing energy levels throughout the day, the type of food you eat, your sleep(schedule), your emotions, ... and manipulate them to optimize the process and the speed with which we achieve our goals.\n\nOur environment influences our thoughts. The people with which you surround yourself, the music you listen to, the air quality, hormones in foods, physical exercise, diet and much more.\n\nThis philosophy will guide people and give them techniques on how we can use our primitive biological instincts and how work with our nature instead of against it.\n\nWe will also discuss techniques on how one should learn him/herself self-discipline and other things to achieve their goals. Controlling your emotions and not letting the emotions control you, and how to manipulate and use certain emotions for your own benefit.\n\nFor example if you want to stop eating sweets, think of all the bad chemicals, and the crap they put inside it and think of the negative effects will have on your body and health, you should develop a strong feeling of disgust (and fear) for it, and it's not bad if you exaggerate a bit (but make sure to use your common sense), every time you think of sweets you should associate it with things that you absolutely don\u2019t want and things you fear, for example the image of rotting corpses and flies eating away the rotting flesh, its disgusting smell, and the buzzing noises the flies make, also visualize all kinds of diseases, darkness, epidemics, death, recall disgusting smells like sewer odor, think of vomiting and other bad things. You should if you combine this with some other techniques, and when you do all this, it's very easy to stop eating sweets, even without doing much effort. This was just an extremely simple example, just imagine what you are capable of if you want to achieve something that\u2019s more complex and difficult.\n\nThe philosophy consists of two main things: self-improvement and perfecting yourself on the inside by using your primitive instincts to optimize this process, and perfecting the world around you.\n\nWe can cure depression, and other types of mental illnesses, and prevent certain diseases naturally like cancer to some extent. All information already out there on the internet, but you have to know where to look... it also takes quite a lot of time to filter all the information and often you find conflicting or just wrong information.\n\nThe latter is also another reason why I want to start this 'movement', to gather all the useful information that's out there, in one place so we can share it with one another.\n\nWe\u2019ll also have several sub-categories related to like art and music which I will go over very briefly in this post, but we\u2019ll also have other sub-categories related to health and longevity, improving the cognitive abilities, a list of quotes, books that are worth reading, applying psychology in your daily life, and many more\u2026 and maybe later we\u2019ll add finance and business as well.\n\nA new art style as a sub-category of movement:  \nWe\u2019ll also try to develop a new art style, composed of forms with strong angled and hexagonal lines, such as diamond and honeycomb shapes, and other geometrical forms. Powerful and abstract shapes, with a combination of static forms and symmetry, while still having strong dynamic lines. It gives the viewer feeling of power, strength, amazement, innovation and order, while still giving a feeling of harmony. It looks simple on first glance but is fascinatingly complex if you look a little deeper.\n\nSome of the art styles we\u2019ll borrow from are: Ancient Japanese and Chinese lattice patterns, decorations, and architecture, (Neo-)classicism, classical eclecticism, 'Mandalorian' design style, Jedi temples (both from Star Wars) those styles are similar to what I\u2019m aiming for.\n\nWe\u2019ll also create our own insignia, symbols, and banners in the process. (I\u2019ve also made some rough sketches for logo/symbol of our movement, and I\u2019ve also gathered several things related to that new kind of art.)\n\nMusic will be another subcategory as well:  \nWe\u2019ll share epic orchestral and choral triumph and (battle) music, similar to Two Steps From Hell, Audiomachine and music from YouTube channels like: MrEpicOSTs, Epic Music World, Pandora Journey, HDSoundDI, ThePrimeCronus, ect. (Also mainly upbeat music.)\n\n(And maybe later on members can compose their own music as well)\n\nLater we also want to include:\n\nProgrammers to automate some things, and to make a special kind of platform where we can gather all the information in one place so it's easy to access, and easy to add new things to the already existing content. I\u2019m also interested in game development, machine learning and much more, and we have loads of idea\u2019s for potential apps and useful programs we can work on, but that will come later.\n\nWe will borrow some aspects of Eastern philosophies/religions like: Shintoism, Japanese philosophy, Taoism, Confucianism.

And from other philosophies like: Militarism, Prussianism, Perfectionism and Optimism, and from other kinds of mentalities and mindsets.

But if you are not sure that you will be able to do something that provides value to the movement or you want to provide value but don\u2019t know how, then you can DM me. (I won't reply in the comments)\n\nI want the movement to grow gradually and slowly so the first weeks only 1-5 people can join, and when everyone has the same vision and is on the same wavelength, and when the core is ready we can start to expand the movement.\n\nYou're one of the few that made it to the end, congratulations. So if you're interested feel free to DM me and I\u2019ll give you my discord. (If you send me a message, don\u2019t forget to include your age, gender, your interests, why you would like to join, or anything else that would be useful.

I am tired of not being myself, of always having to hide my real personality and interests. So, umm, I am looking for someone who would accept me as I am.\n\nWe could talk about things that have happened in our lives, I don't care if they are mundane, funny or sad. We could talk about mental health problems and life in general (trust me, I have quite an experience regarding this).\n\nMaybe we could talk about our common interests, although they were the thing that failed my last online friendships. I had too much faith in them. F\\* common interests, ours probably won't overlap significantly in order to be the main thing to base our friendship on. But anyways, I am looking for someone who wouldn't judge me when I show them that my favorite song is some old electronic track or that I spent whole Friday evening reading a book that no one reads anymore. In return I promise not to judge your taste, be it rap music or musicals, tv shows or black and white films.\n\nAlso I am looking for someone who would be ok with the fact that I would like talk about 1-3 times a week and possibly schedule those times, because my life is quite busy and I am very introverted. I prefer voice chats over text, they just feel more 'real' than text messages. Also I am an 18 year old girl (and pls be ok with my ugly appearance).

We used to get into fights sometimes, and I would apologize on my side. But she never did on her side with the excuse that she was having a hard time. Then, we started to talk less. After a while of not talking, she said that she needed me to visit her because she was suffering from depression. I agreed (intercontinental flight situation). But in our convos, she was always stressed, complaining and being too aggresive (for me at least). To add up, yesterday, she canceled our meeting. Today I told her that we had an ugly conversation, that she was always interrupting me, she sounded annoyed and wanted to end the convo (besides cancelling our trip). She said \"I thought it would be nice talking to you, but I guess its not\". I said: \"this has always been happening. I want to help you but you need to realize how you are behaving. And also I'm not accepting your comment cause it only makes someone feel bad and you just achieved that\". She said \"I dont want to be your friend anymore, I didnt say anything wrong, and I cant take this\" (blocks me after 3 years of friendship) \n\nPersonal note: No I am the one that cannot take this anymore. I am always apologizing whenever there is an argument. I am the one that says I love you (as a friend) all the time and that I worry and think about you. I am the one that gets depressed at night for things that you told me. I am the one that feels guilty for saying something stupid and lets you say anything cause you are always sad. The night before you ended our friendship I was crying and couldnt sleep till 4 am. You have said hurtful things before and most of the time I let it pass cause you have depression. And storing all that inside me made depressed as well. I cant, anymore, let you behave like whatever you like just cause you are depressed. I have feelings too, I get hurt as well. And now you are ending our friendship cause I call you on it?\n\nI feel terrible and guilty, but honestly, I felt abused. I had to say how I felt because my life was becoming a mess out of guilt and being depressed for this. Now im going to feel worse cause she is no longer in my life. No I dont want to have new friends. And I will feel like everything comes crashing down. She is suffering from depression and I didnt know how to tell her to behave or be nice or even help her. Now I have someone that hates me in life, and no one that is happy to hang out with me like we used to.\n\nFriendship sucks, it just hurts and I no longer see the point on having friends.\n\nI honestly feel that I failed every friend that I ever met. I still feel that I am the problem. And probably no one will read this cause its too long. I had plans this weekend, now I just want to die in a hole.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I was hoping I can make friends with more people like that. Don't worry about those I'm already talking with I will still talk with you. Just trying to expand my friends list. \n\nI graduated from college with a degree in film mostly focusing on editing. I suffer from both anxiety and depression. It effects me a lot on day to day basis mostly depression. Some days I'm fine Some I'm not. So if I complain about being depressed please understand I can't control it and at least be sympathetic towards it. \n\nI'm somewhere on the autism spectrum probably closer associated with aspergers. Its not as severe as other people probably. Like you wouldn't think i have It because I'm on the high functioning side of the spectrum. However my social skills are really bad which makes it difficult to make friends in real life. \n\nIn terms of Hobbies. My favorite stuff to do is watch movies or tv shows. Some of my favorite movies are The Dark Knight, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, and Apocalypse Now. Some of my favorite tv shows currently are Big Little Lies, The Handmaid's Tale, Black Mirror, Stranger Things, Westworld, Rick and Morty, American Horror Story, Barry and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. However I watch a lot of other movies and shows as well. I'm also big Fan of Star Wars, Game of Thrones, and Marvel. So feel free to give me suggestions on movies or shows to watch\n\nI love animals particularly Dogs and hamsters. Huskies are my favorite breed but I also love bulldogs. Sadly I don't have a dog or any pet but, would love one in the future. \n\nI'm a big WWE fan or at least try to watch what I can. Been watching since 2006. So if you like WWE that would be awesome. \n\nI love rock music from the 70s-90. My favorite bands are (AC/DC, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Guns N Roses, Kiss, Metallica, and Queen). \n\nOther things I like are to learn about history, conspiracy theories/mysteries even though I don't believe most of them, Memes, and Sports. \n\nSo yeah feel free to message me if any of these things interest you \ud83d\ude03. If you going to message me I recommend you being around my age at least 19-27. I can make some exceptions though. \n\nImportant, don't bother sending me a message if your just going to ghost.

It's fine if your forgot to respond but, I usually think if it fizzles out and you never get back to me. That you don't care to talk again. \n\nDon't care what gender just want friends who share interests to talk. I have Whatsapp, kik, Snapchat and, Discord but I want to keep the conversation on Reddit for now. Until we get to know each other more.

I am a loner. I am weird. If anything I said offended you, I apologise. Be kind to each other.\n\nHi, I am a 20 year old \"female\" with the soul of a 40 year old man. Yes. I know. Don't ask.\n\nJk. Ask anything. I'm an open book.\n\nI've been looking to make friends online but it seems I am not capable of that anymore. Probably because of my interests? I have extreme mood swings. Either I am thinking about suicide, death, right to die, masochism, self destruction, ways for me to get cancer, OR I am thinking about  getting a job, moving out, starting my own business, going to college, moving to a different country, getting married, having kids, adopting kids, adopting cats, adopting a dog or the extreme of the extreme when I get delusional about starting my own religion and making a free kitchen so homeless people can eat.\n\nIt feels like there are a few people living in my head and most of the time it's the suicidal one talking. It seems like I am only looking for people to use them to see if they can give me any information on how I can get cancer. OR I end up looking for love despite being in a relationship. I'm a mess. I don't know what I'm doing.\n\nSome fun facts to brighten this post:\n\nI like farting and smelling my armpits. They always smell like food and it makes me feel good when we have no money for food(other than bread, stupid bread). No, I don't eat poop. I am actually a germaphobe. Not scared of Germans, \"scared\" of germs. Wash hands 30 times a day yet shower once a week. Oh the irony.\n\nI like eating unripe green bananas and eating the salty powder in dehydrated soup packets.\n\nEnough fun facts!\n\nI message back instantly unless I am busy. I like getting lots of messages and long messages about the persons thoughts and feelings.\n\nI think the most important and (possibly) only necessary rule in life is to respect each other and never do harm unless out of protection.\n\n Also compassion. Very important. If you don't have it please don't message me.\n\nIf you are 18-80 and you are not scared of me feel free to message me. I am cold and distant at first but get attached quickly. Unless we don't click in which case please don't hate me.\n\nRandom fact time again!\n\nI love food. I love tea. I love incense(the burning stick with a cheap ocean smell).\n\nIf I ever go to college I want to be a psychotherapist or something similar. Main interests would be trauma, abuse, addiction and grief.\n\nI like winter and snow so thought about moving to the great sunny city that is Canada. But that is still thinking to far ahead. And yes, I love thinking very far ahead. I mostly focus on death so I kind of plan backwards. Like I am figuring out how I will die, then my retirement, what I will leave to my kids to make their life easier, how I will raise them, how I will figure my life out before everything else, and then we reach this point of me sitting here typing on a phone wondering if anyone will ever read this. Or. If it will just get deleted and/or banned. Well. Don't know what else to say.\n\nI fall in love with people who are nice to me but don't worry about it, it goes away very fast and even if it didn't, I got a boyfriend I'm stuck with till one of us dies(haha sorry if you read this my love, don't get all mad, I'm just writing what comes to mind, and I am with you by choice and you know that).\n\nI have a friend who died who I believe I will meet again when I die. Hence my obsession with death grew stronger.\n\nI don't support organised religion but as long as you are compassionate and respectful I don't mind what you believe in. I am very spiritual and my only hope is death and the afterlife.\n\nI am against sexism(both towards men and women), racism, homophobia, transphobia.\nI am very against institutions, groups and individuals who are after money, power and controlling people. That includes certain religions(and inside every religion there are exceptions of course), certain public school systems, the government in general and similar.\n\nDon't believe everything you hear on the news. Don't believe everything you read.\n\nEverything is commercialised and it pisses me off. Just another way of certain people manipulating the public to get more money out of them. If I could I would live in the woods away from society. But too scared of bugs at the moment. And wild animals.\n\nI used to like music. Still sing sometimes. Not very well but I enjoy it. Sometimes.\n\nI'm on meds since my hospitalised suicide attempt last year so I can be pretty numb sometimes.\n\nGot some physical pain and (I guess?) chronic issues.\n\nI like sleeping a lot. Need at least 12 hours. Spend time in bed most of the time because I am too fatigued to get up. It makes me nauseous and sometimes I throw up.\n\nI am very irresponsible and impatient for someone who feels old. I can go from acting like a 5 year old to acting like a 40 year old but it seems I never act my age.\n\nIt feels like I wrote everything about my current situation. I guess leaving no mysteries there. Message me if you think I'm not too crazy to have a conversation with or be friends with. Or if you just want to comment I like comments too. :)\n\nEdit: I mean no disrespect for people with cancer. My best friend died of it and since that my guilt and grief have made me want it too so I can go and be with him. It is by no means trying to say that cancer is not serious. It is very serious and soul destroying. Both for the person itself and loved ones. I apologise if I have hurt anyone.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

And I just feel like my friends simply don't realize/ understand what it's like to have so many stressful and scary things to face. I guess they just think it's a few simple problems that I deal with easily and then they just expect me to sort of fit in and do the fun things with them without relaising that I don't have as much free time as they do. And so, that puts even more pressure on me because I don't want to let them down.\n\nI guess their lives are just very different from mine. So, I guess it is difficult for them to relate to me.\n\nThis is all especially true for my closest friend who just keeps on making jokes when I'm feeling down. This would be a good thing if his jokes were uplifting, but he has a dark sense of humor and just keeps on accidentally making me feel bad by mocking my situation. i told him a few times but he didn't seem to realize the impact he has on me when I'm sad.

So I've had this friend for a long time. Since we were 5. \n\nWe've had some really good times, but about a year ago, I told her I can't be friends anymore. Some background:\n\nShe has struggled with very serious depression and anxiety for a long time. She has called me and said \"I'm going to kill myself\" at which point I talked her down. \n\nI was basically her therapist. She would text me all day when I was at work (she doesn't work) and tell me she was so bored or depressed or whatever and would get angry when I didn't answer immediately because \"I needed you!!!\". \n\nI came over to her house ALL THE TIME. Like almost daily after work because she was lonely because her husband worked long hours. When I was there, we would watch television, generally. She would sometimes even play on the computer while I was there. \n\nAfter she had children (2 boys) I was the one who looked after them when I was over. She'd beg me to change their diapers or feed them or whatever because she was too depressed. She is, to be honest, a bad mom. She never played with her kids. Ever. I did or her dad did, as he lived with them for a period of time. She just let them watch tv all day long. \n\nI also drove her everywhere because she didn't have a license for a long time. I bought her meals, I brought food over often, I bought stuff for her kids. \n\nShe also wasn't interested in my problems. I'd try to say \"hey, I'm having a shit day, can I talk about it?\" and she'd make it about herself. \"You think YOUR day was shitty, well blah blah blah\" or she'd  just dismiss me. \n\nA couple years ago, her husband asked for a divorce. Who was there while she cried? Me. I can't stand her husband because he's a tool but I cannot blame him for getting angry for her refusal to work or take care of their kids properly or do housework. He did everything and worked 60 hours a week. \n\nI forget exactly what the last straw was, but I'd had enough and I sort of ghosted her. She asked me what was up and then I told her that I was burned the fuck out and that we couldn't be friends anymore because we had different lives. \n\nI don't expect my friends to pay me back when I buy dinner as a treat. I don't expect to be compensated for playing with their kids or changing diapers. But the fact that she never even offered or attempted to provide support for me drove me up the wall. If I couldn't come over, I was being selfish and \"not making time\" for her but she never offered to come to my place instead, even after she had her license and didn't have kids yet. \n\nI still have her on Facebook and we check in occasionally but I haven't seen her in person in months and I talk to her briefly maybe once every few weeks. \n\nI feel a lot of guilt about this. I know cutting her off really hurt her and I know that much of her  behaviour was a result of very severe depression (including post-partum) and (previously undiagnosed) borderline personality disorder. \n\nBut I just can't go back.

Smart, funny, but ever since he failed out of law school, he's just been in limbo. He failed out 3 years ago. He doesn't want to go back because he's 96k in debt. He works 2nd shift at some shit factory job and works as a material handler. I've told him time and again that he should go back but he refuses and just shuts down. He's basically shut off from the outside world. Doesn't have a boyfriend (he's gay), doesn't go to the bars, doesn't seem to want to do anything anymore besides skate. I love him like a brother but he gets up at noon, pisses his day away and then goes to work. He has a paralegal certificate but law firms want experience. We're both 28 and working in the same factory. He's too comfortable and has been doing the same thing for too long. Someone who was smart enough to get into law school should not be such a fucking idiot. I just feel bad for him. All the light has gone out of his eyes and it just feels like he's waiting for all this misery to end. I can't watch him crash and burn anymore, it just hurts too much. I'm leaving the factory next year to go get my college degree in chemistry. Funny enough it was him that encouraged me to go to uni in the first place. I feel terrible for him. But life knocked him on his ass and he refuses to get back up.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I feel if I lived down there it would be so easy to divorce and live with my family but I cant do that here because there would be nowhere for me to go. \n\nI feel like a coward since I still live with him and despite the asshole that he is I still act the motions of a relationship so my day-to-day life isnt as vengeful or difficult. I do this even when every other thing stabs me in the heart with memories of his infidelity and my own stupidity for getting in this situation.\n\nI know it's bad, but I've stopped reaching out to non-school people here because if they still see me hanging around him, I dont want to disappoint them with the fact that despite their advise I haven't grown the spine to file for divorce, nor figured out how to live isolated in a different state, nor asked my parents to help me find a place for myself. I know these are things I should do, but with the stress of nursing school I have chosen not to do them right now.\n\nI fear that I'm not going to find someone again. I spilled my heart. I got married. I will most likely get divorced in my 20s.  I feel most guys won't be looking for that or that they'd think I'm either a stupid person for rushing into a relationship or  damaged goods because the stigma about divorcees. I feel that the majority of guys who have professions have already found someone they cherish even in my nursing program. I see these couples talk about their relationships and I feel so devastated about my own relationship and how aparent it is that my husband never looked at me like that.\n\nOn top of all this, I feel like I'm floating socially in my nursing program. Everyone is nice to each other, but I haven't found a solid friend in my 6 weeks in the program while everyone else seems to have found their groups. I can't tell if I'm socially awkward or if I am stand-offish or if it's because I'm new to Washington or if it's something I dont realize I'm doing. \n\nI feel alone while putting on a mask to the world that I'm okay, that everything is working out, that I have a plan for a future, that I'm confident in my abilities, that my relationships haven't fallen apart.

One of my friends (let\u2019s call her Hannah) has a friend who is very demanding, dominating etc. They were nearly inseparable for a while when they lived in the same town, and her friend (let\u2019s call her Tina) would always come along when Hannah was invited. Several of our friends from junior high really hated Tina and did not want her to come, but it is like Hannah could not say no to her. \n\nNow, I thought those friends overreacted. I\u2019ve really liked Tina. Sure, she is a bit \u201cmuch\u201d and very loud, but I am outgoing too so we got along well. Last night I really saw her ugly side and realized how toxic she is. \n\nWe had been at a party and were in a bar. Hannah was sitting next to a guy who seemed to show her some interest, and Hannah was interested too. Tina was at the end of the table and got really mad. She sent Hannah a text saying \u201cNO\u201d and stuff like that. Later she dragged Hannah off and when they came back, SHE sat down next to that guy and basically threw herself on him while Hannah sat further away. This annoyed me, so when passing Tina I tried to tell her that Hannah was interested and she should respect that. She got really mad and told me to butt out of her business. \n\nI talked to Hannah and asked why she let Tina walk all over her. Why she just accepted that Tina was the one who should sit next to and talk to that guy, especially when he was clearly more interested in Hannah and tried making contact with her. She said that was not a battle she was willing to fight. I told her it was unfair and that Tina could be very selfish sometimes. She said yes, she knows. Whenever they go out, if someone hits on Hannah and not her she gets mad and demand they leave. Whenever Hannah shows interest in someone she instantly tries to hit on him. If Hannah - or anyone else - dances with the person Tina is interested in she gets furious. Hannah\u2019s cousin was at the party too and told me Tina had said, randomly, to Hannah\u2019s face that \u201cyour cousin is so much prettier than you\u201d, which Hannah\u2019s cousin felt was both very rude and unnecessary. We all know Hannah has had some self-esteem issues and when she has finally begun getting over it, her friend tries to pull her back down into low self-esteem. \n\nIn short, her friend acts like a mix between a psycho and a jealous boyfriend. She monopolizes Hannah\u2019s attention and is mad when someone shows her interest. She told Hannah I had been trying to drive a wedge between them because I had told her she was not being a very good friend to Hannah. Being a wingwoman is apparently unheard of. It has reached the point where Hannah doesn\u2019t dare to tell her if she is dating someone or interested in someone because she knows Tina will either get mad or try hitting on them instead. It is like she can\u2019t accept that Hannah gets something she doesn\u2019t and has to try to \u201coutdo\u201d her. \n\nAfter last night I am both mad and very worried. Tina ended up going home with that guy, and even though it all worked out great and the rest of us danced all night and had good fun (after Hannah\u2019s self esteem bettered she doesn\u2019t really care all that much about men when we go out, just to have fun with friends - which might be something Tina has caught up on and the reason she acted so irrationally) I can\u2019t help but be worried about their friendship. \n\nHannah admits it is very difficult being friends with Tina and she is too dominating. But she doesn\u2019t want any drama so she lets her act as she does. I am much more confrontational than Hannah and thus thinks she should tell Tina to stop being a b!7(&amp;amp;amp;amp; or stop being her friend, but Hannah is afraid to lose her. They have become very close and Tina is apparently great when it does NOT come to these things (men, etc). But I am worried, what happens if Hannah gets a boyfriend? Tina will lose it. She says she has tried talking to Tina about how she acts especially when drunk, but to no avail. \u201cSisters over misters, chicks over dicks\u201d apparently means nothing to Tina either. \n\nI am very loyal to my friends and this might be why I got so angry with Tina. She always expects Hannah to back off if she is interested in someone but does the opposite when it\u2019s the other way around. \n\nAny advice? I can\u2019t go in and ruin their friendship by doing what Hannah should have done long ago (last night I was so mad I almost wanted to challenge her to a fight), but I am very worried about Hannah. She walks on eggshells around one of her best friends and doesn\u2019t dare tell her things in case she gets mad. It\u2019s not supposed to be like this. \n\nTl;dr I have a friend whose friend basically wants Hannah to herself and gets irrationally mad whenever for example a man shows interest in Hannah. She actively hits on the men who do and demands they leave if someone hits on Hannah and not her. If someone confronts her with her actions she claims they are trying to come between her and Hannah. Basically she walks all over her and I need advice on what to do.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I don\u2019t wanna exist anymore\n\nEdit:\n\nThank you all for the kind words. I\u2019ve only had enough breakdowns today that I can count on two hands... so I\u2019m doing pretty okay.\n\nWe talked. I confronted her about all of it. \n\nTurns out she isn\u2019t happy in this relationship, and hasn\u2019t been a while. She swears she hasn\u2019t physically cheated, but admits to emotionally cheating for a bit now. I know it\u2019s my fault, I have too many shortcomings and that\u2019s the damn truth. I haven\u2019t been making her happy. \nInitially I figured the main problem is that right now I have no money and no stable job/income to pay my part of the rent, to which I have developed a debt to her (she has been paying my half of the rent).\nBut,\nShe says we\u2019re incompatible.\nAnd as of today she doesn\u2019t want to date.\n\n\nWe live together, so tonight after her work she\u2019s gonna come home and we\u2019re gonna talk about it. As far as she knows, she doesn\u2019t see any reason to keep trying. As for me, I just wanna know what are the reasons why she says we\u2019re incompatible. I have an idea of some. But I wanna know everything she has to say, every feeling she feels. If I feel like I can overcome these shortcomings of mine that make her feel like we\u2019re incompatible, then I\u2019ll want to make an effort to do so with her. \n\nBut the ultimate decision is hers. I\u2019m not gonna force her to do anything more for me and us. \n\nIf there\u2019s any hope of redemption, I\u2019m gonna get off my ass and fucking push myself for excellence for myself, and for us. If it ends tonight, I\u2019ll have to go back home (across the country) and start there.\n\nEdit2:\n\nI forgot to mention that I am a selfish asshole. There are many times where I let my own insecurity destroy both of our trusts. I hurt her many times too. I realize that now.\n\nEdit3:\n\nWe\u2019ve talked, laid our problems out on the table, figured out why and how we got to this point of incompatibility. We weighed our options on whether or not we could move forward, and most importantly we talked about what happened last night. \n\nWe both aren\u2019t too sure what happened, she knows she got drunk but it her intention was never to get black out wasted, which is what happened. She wanted to go home as soon as the drinking stopped, and her coworker (the bartender who poured her the drinks) offered her a ride home. After the point where she got into her car, she says she blacked out and doesn\u2019t remember a single thing. She says she was probably drugged and taken advantage of, I somewhat believe this explanation. She was absolutely incoherent when I found her last morning half naked in his car. Her eyes were glazed over and she looked absolutely dead. Things happened, she apologized, I don\u2019t know if I forgive her but the both of us have come to terms that her mistake was an extremely fucked up one. \n\nAfter we got that discussion out of the way we thought very long and hard about it. She says she doesn\u2019t want to break up, but doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth it in the long run to keep trying if she doesn\u2019t know for sure if we will get better, or if it\u2019s worth it to be unhappy for however long it takes for me to heal and get my shit together. Because the main issue is that we are both on different levels of maturity. She\u2019s much more fiscally responsible, and just more mature in terms of other responsibilities and education and work. \n\nNothing is set in stone as to our future. Part of me doesn\u2019t want to forgive her, and I feel sick to my stomach looking at her knowing she (most likely) did have sex with her coworker yesterday or he touched her or anything in between. Part of me still loves her and wants to make things work. \n\nPart of her still loves me and wants me to be happy, but part of her wants to make herself happy and not deal with the stress and baggage that I carry. \n\nThis will be the last update", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I guess eventually chatting just dies out, so here I am again. So, long story short:\n\nI am 22 years old girl from Russia, a year ago I moved to the Netherlands to study. Now I am living with my boyfriend in Tilburg and studying. I am into geek and weird stuff, I like cosplay festivals, anime, gaming, nerdy stuff and laughing out anxiety with good old fucked up memes. I noticed people here in the Netherlands have that \u201cdoe normaal\u201d mentality mostly, where everything weird is bad and everything \u201cnormal\u201d is good. Well, this is the post for those who think that they don\u2019t fit in that doe normal profile and have hobbies outside of \u201cdrinking beer with friends\u201d and \u201cclothes shopping\u201d. No offence to people who doe normaal, I just mention it because I get a lot of messages from people who have absolutely nothing with me in common and nothing related to them in my friend-seeking posts and just message me since I am a fEmAlE. Please, don\u2019t. But if you\u2019re a loner who just wants to have a friend to talk to and maybe even go to places, here I am. I can help with anything, from talking about things and support to ordering a coffee in caf\u00e9 if you\u2019re too anxious.\n\nAnyway, my \u201chashtags\u201d for people I would really wanna be friends with: depression, social anxiety, mental problems, lgbt-friendly, anime, gaming, cosplay, crossdressing, forever alone, deep talks, weird, open-minded, IT, programming, nerdy, boardgames, geek, fandoms, memes, cosplay festivals.\n\nIt is fine if you\u2019re not fitting under this profile, but at least write why you want to be friends with me.

In other words, it's harder to find reasons to convince everyone to hang out.\n\nOur most recent meetups usually consist in eating together or playing videogames, which is fine to me but I can see why someone else might grow stale of it.

I don't expect anyone to read it. I just need to write this out and maybe talk to someone. I just don't know what to do my life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years back I moved to a new state and felt pretty depressed. It was just far enough away from family and a few old friends that I felt like I couldn\u2019t easily go see them. Slowly, I made some friends here but I still felt deeply depressed. I had a low wage and a poor social life. I was filled with regret and uncertainty. I honestly wasn't sure about living anymore it wrecked me quite a few weekend nights. I never went to a doctor about depression but whatever I had really started to impact my life. Eventually, I picked up a new hobby. I forced myself to talk to people and I started to make a couple friends then and generally be more open. The social life was still pretty poor and I felt worthless. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the new hobby I met a girl. I tried to talk to her more and I made it a goal to ask her out. I used this as a way to prove I had value as a person and I was worth something. We started to date. I never really thought I was in love but I was happy to feel like I mattered at least a little bit. Flash forward a year or so and my social life is much better. She moved (not terribly far away) but we still dated. She demanded more of my time and my social life began to take hits. Fair enough. We did things near where she lived and some near my place. I also came to terms with the fact she had bad anxiety and was prone to breaking down into massive crying fits often, couldn't handle watching movies, playing games, or anything that wasn\u2019t already one of her like 3 hobbies. I did complain about my job a lot but I felt like I could never be truly negative or have an actual bad day around her unless I wanted to spend the night trying to help her get it back together. I tried to accommodate her because I know that shit is tough. But it began to grate on me and was becoming harder to deal with each week. She was trying new medications so it wasn\u2019t like she wasn\u2019t putting in effort either. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack in my social life, a new girl joined the social circle and all she wanted was to make friends. I remember feeling that exact same way to the point where I thought dying might not be the worst thing anymore. So I tried to be nice and she became a good friend. We had a smaller group that did a few things together here and there. Since my girlfriend wasn\u2019t around often people often thought we were dating. But, she was bouncing between dating random people. We just got along well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the meantime, the job I had was crushing my soul. Going to work was a chore. It paid shit and came with nothing but tremendous amounts of work and no recognition but the occasional \"People should want to work more\" type attitude from my boss. One of my best days ever was when I got a new job. It was closer to my girlfriend and it paid a lot more. I finally felt like life was looking better and that saving money/doing things was actually possible. The only negative was that we did way more things towards her place and my job. I stopped getting invited to things and fell into a bit of a funk. I still hung out with those friends but it was nowhere near as often. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFlash forward another year and she wants to move in together. After a lot of debate, I know the right move was to break up. It's serious to move in with someone. I never really felt anymore in love than on the first date and I did not feel in love then. I moved in with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJump another half a year and we're barely coming up on the halfway mark of our lease. We don\u2019t really argue but small things pop up. It really fells like smaller things are becoming bigger issues to me. The most obvious case of this is that I can\u2019t stand the sound of chewing and I constantly have to ask her to chew with her mouth closed. She \u201cjust likes the sound so much\u201d that she will basically never start eating that way until I mention it. It drives me fucking wild. This has gone this way for like 2 years but it fells like it\u2019s getting so much worse to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn\u2019t break down in crying fits much anymore but I still know I can\u2019t even get angry around her or else she will. She still can\u2019t watch anything with the smallest amount of violence so now most things I enjoy I completely keep to myself. It almost feels like I\u2019m living with a roommate I talk to. But I don\u2019t think she listens very well either. That kind of drives our smaller arguments with her not telling me about events often and then ignoring other things. I do it too, but it just feels like she does it so much more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe complained I don\u2019t pay enough for things when I refused to buy gas on a trip. I was incredibly angry and then had to spend the day trying to make her feel better because I was angry. We downloaded Splitwise to track who pays for what and to make sure one person doesn\u2019t pay for way more stuff. The downside is I don\u2019t enter everything into it but she does. She has now paid all our bills for the last few months since now she constantly owes me a lot of money. I know she\u2019s bad with money but it feels like it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t pay attention to things I do or to us as a whole. It feels selfish. But she is nice and she tries so I don\u2019t think she really is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe\u2019s brought up getting married before. But now she\u2019s saying how her coworkers talk about it all the time. She says she isn\u2019t hinting at it but she definitely is given the rate these coworker comments have increased. I just don\u2019t think I can marry her. I don\u2019t think I should have moved in with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings have really come crashing down lately as my friends said I really need to make moves and propose. Another friend just did and now more people have made comments to me. It's really picking up pace and pressure from places I never received it. I guess this is also what she is feeling. the part I have a hard time with is that I honestly believe the other girl in our social group and I get along much better. It\u2019s like every time we hang out it feels more natural. She just went through a big breakup with someone she was serious with and has reached out for help. I\u2019ve been trying to help and stay distant. I\u2019m not worried about cheating but it feels wrong. It's also because it's already been much easier to help her than my current girlfriend. I used to cancel plans and stay up for hours to help her through her panic attacks and I'm pretty worn down from it all. It was almost surprising how much less effort it took. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the end of the day, I feel like a terrible person. I think I\u2019m getting closer to the other girl. But I moved with my current girlfriend already. I know I shouldn't be like this. But I'm really being eaten up about all of this and trying to look at it any way I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. Because coupled with all that, my company has told me that we are closing down this month. Everyone has pushed for new jobs. The process is going ok but I don\u2019t have anything lined up just yet. I don\u2019t have a lot of money in savings. So if the answer is break up and move out, I really don\u2019t think I can right now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like a shitty person but this relationship had always been taxing to me emotionally. Anything would help. Advice. Words. Whatever. I\u2019ve been lingering on this for a long time but have really kicked it into gear the last few weeks.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Very interested in mathematics and computer science (because how could you not be?).\n* Really like some kinds of metal (think Bring Me the Horizon or Asking Alexandria), rock (GnR, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Franz Ferdinand, etc.), and indie bands (Royal Blood, Gang of Youths, Car Seat Headrest, etc.) . I\u2019m open to new stuff so hit me up with your recommendations.\n* I like mafia movies like The GodFather and Goodfellas because I find the characters extremely interesting. A lot of movies by Quentin Tarantino also make my top 10 list.\n\nThe reason I\u2019m writing this is because I have real trouble relating to other people. My interests do not line up with theirs and I am not willing to make compromises or pretending I like something only to further my relationships. You can see how this leads to some shallow friendships; we get together and have a good laugh but there\u2019s no real substance behind it.\n\nIt\u2019s been that way for as long as I can remember. The only place I feel like I belong is on the internet, among millions of other strangers who all share (roughly) the same view of the world, humor, and ideas that I do.

Is it wrong of me to feel hurt and betrayed?", "author": "throwaway9436721", "self_text": "This is going to be a rather long story for full context, so bear with me. I'll try to remember to add a TLDR at the end.\n\nI first met one of my friends (Lets call them Riley) online through similar interests, and that's what got us talking. Turned out both of us had been bullied a lot while growing up, dealt with a lot of social anxiety and found it difficult to trust and open up to people, etc. Riley had also been on anti-depressants for several years because of a long struggle with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter 2-3 years of being friends with Riley, we started hanging out in person - going to coffee shops, hanging out at the park, etc. It wasn't, as far as I knew, intended to be any form of dating - just us hanging out. I was often told that I was comfortable to be around, one of the few friends they felt like they could talk to, and it eventually turned into us cuddling with each other. I had come to love Riley by this point, and found it really nice to have someone to cuddle up next to. Riley never indicated that they were opposed to it either, even though I consistently asked them to let  me know if I was making them uncomfortable. If anything, there were even things that Riley said/did that gave me the impression that there was interest in things getting sexual. Things didn't go much further than that, though - There was some touching and kissing a few times, but that was it.\n\nI've never been particularly comfortable with sex, innuendo, overly crude jokes, and so on. Riley, on the other hand, was much more open with sexual discussion and their sense of humour was more heavily aligned that way. I was comfortable enough with Riley that it didn't bother me much generally, and was even comfortable enough to make the odd double entendre here and there (though the focus was meant to be the word play rather than the innuendo).\n\nThen Riley effectively disappeared for a period of 4 months. They could still be seen being actilve online from time to time. I found myself worried that I had done something wrong to push them away, as I saw mention of their depression kicking back up just a few days after I last saw them, and it really just left me uncertain of many things. I'd message them, but conversation didn't really happen much, amd it was usually short when it did. They didn't really talk to me about anything anymore, or initiate conversation.\n\nWe did meet up again a few more times after that 4 month period, though things felt awkward. I had inquired somewhere along the way whether I had made them uncomfortable or done anything wrong, to which they had said I hadn't. My anxiety had gotten the better of me in a lot of ways during those 4 months. I found myself feeling disconnected or otherwise uncomfortable in some of the online communities I was part, and ended up leaving some of them. One of of them in particular, which Riley was part of, I left because the amount of sexual innuendo and crude jokes that had been happening was getting more frequent, and the jokes were getting more and more crude as time went on. I told Riley that I had left, and why I had left (figuring that it would be better to hear it from me than just find out from someone else), but I got the impression that they didn't take the news too well even if they understood the reasoning and tried to sound supportive of the decision.\n\nWe stayed in contact, but things still felt weird to me. We didn't see each other often, and I got the impression they were uncomfortable when we did. If I asked if they were okay, they'd say they were fine. \n\nEventually, Riley messaged me and said they were making plans to meet up with a few of the other people in the online community that I had left, and invited me to join them.  I agreed to go, despite being worried that the other community members were a) going to grill me on why I had left or b) make me uncomfortable in the same ways that had made me leave the community in the first place.\n\nThe day of the Meetup came around, and the anxiety was there - as you might expect. Riley recognized I was uncomfortable and asked me if I was okay. I said I wasn't but I'd deal with it, to which Riley said that I could talk to them about whatever was bothering me. I avoided it at first because I was worried they wouldn't take it well.\n\nAnd so then the Meetup began. The subject of why I had left the community never came up, but the innuendo and crude jokes were out in full force. I tried to interact a bit here and there, but mostly just sat around anxiously and wanted it to be over. Riley continued to give me concerned glances as the meetup progressed,and I eventually felt like I needed to say something. I messaged Riley to say that I was uncomfortable because of all the Innuendo and Jokes. They responded to say that I didn't have a right to feel that way, because I'd made jokes like that in the past. I responded by saying \"Yes, I know it's hypocritical, but that doesn't stop it from bothering me\". Riley effectively responded by slamming their phone down and proceeding to ignore me. \n\nI messaged Riley again several hours later, and asked them if they had an email address. They responded with their email address, but asked why I was asking. I said it was because I wanted to send them something but didn't want to have to worry about character limits (probably not the best wording in retrospect). Riley's response was something along the lines of \"If you want to tell me that our friendship is over, you've basically done that\". I tried to clarify that wasn't it, and instead wanted to try and explain things better. They responded with something along the lines of \"I don't have time to read them now, but I'll read and respond when I get a chance\".\n\nThere was a confirmation that they received them, but no response ever came. A couple of days later, I was sitting around a table with Riley and some mutual friends, so I messaged to see if I could talk to them in private for a bit. Riley's initial response was to look at one of their close friends and roll their eyes. It looked like something was said, but I was unable to hear what. We did end up going to talk in private for a bit, though.\n\nI was visibly uncomfortable (to the point that I was asked why I was shaking) but expressed that I was unsure of where things stood between us because of the silence and lack of response over the last few days. Riley responded with something along the lines of \"Just put it out of your mind. I don't want to deal with this now, and want to go back inside and focus on my friends. We'll talk about that later.\"\n\nIt has been several months since then. I made a couple of attempts to talk to them since then, and even went out to dinner with them once, but things are still awkward and unresolved. I haven't brought any of it up, because they got mad at me the last time I tried to talk about things, but they haven't made any attempts to talk to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR: Told someone close to me that crude sexual humour was making me uncomfortable in a social situation, when I have been known to make such jokes on occasion, because they wanted to know what was wrong, only to have them get mad at me for telling them and it feels like they've been ignoring me ever since.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We started talking because we worked in the same office and used to share part of the commute back to our places. So we started talking, hit it off, started sharing stuff, hanging out, knowing each other's families. You get the point. We've been together through some sad shit in our lives and always had each other's back, always supportive, always loving and caring. Now for the past year, I just feel like she has the same problems she brings upon herself over and over again and does nothing to change her situation other than complain about them. I also noticed during that time, she's been making some negative remarks about things I've said to her but I just realized a couple months ago talking to another friend that knows her but is not friends with her.\nShe has always had a hard time with men, mostly because she's super insecure (her words and her therapist's) and she tends to push guys away or choose guys only because of their appearance in spite of them treating her like shit. She's been with some creepy manipulative men in her life. Now, she always keeps coming back to them. Or she breaks it off and then misses them and wants to go back with them. Or she starts discussing marriage and kids with guys whom she's just met (even though she doesn't want kids) or after dating someone two times. Most of the times, the guys initiate these conversations at the very start and she brushes them off as crazy, but then when the guys feel like she's not interested she feels hurt that they don't wanna marry her and have kids with her because they said so. Even after knowing her for two weeks. Now this has been going on forever, since I've known her. And she's gotten a lot better. At the beginning of our friendship she used to call me crying because she had turned his boyfriend's apartment upside down at the time, only to find out he wasn't hiding anything. Or after going through the guy's phone and finding no messages to other women. After therapy, medication, she got a lot better. She doesn't do that anymore but she still does other things. She refuses to go back to taking medication to help with her overall anxiety and in therapy she doesn't discuss these things, but she does others that are inconsequential IMO. For the past two years or so, she's been on and off with different guys (mostly from Tinder), gets mad at them for still being active on the app despite the fact she is on the app. I've never been the \"enabling friend\". I always tell her what I think even is she doesn't like it (I do this with all my friends, after asking \"do you need me to just listen and support you or do you want the blunt truth?\"). Now, in the last year, she doesn't like me telling her what I think, even though she demands my most honest and brutal opinion. When I tell her what I think she always accuses me of not understanding what she meant. This has strained our relationship and we don't talk as often, the times I've wanted to get together she always had something planned with another friend and every time I told her something about myself she made negative comments. Examples: There's this guy I like and we've been friends for over 20 years and he's made some very subtle moves and I'm not sure what to do and the times I told her she was like \"he's obviously not interested, otherwise he would've done something by now\". Or the times I travelled abroad to visit friends, she said \"You're gonna go to the same place for the third time? Why don't you visit other places, you're wasting your money\". This has happened to numerous things I've shared with her on different topics (family, business, men, etc). She wasn't like this before. She used to be supportive and encouraging and always had nice words for me when I needed them and she used to scold me when I screwed up. Now it's always the glass half empty, if you know what I mean. \nThe other thing she always complains about is money. She has a decent salary, to carry out a \"normal\" life, yet she insists on having a lifestyle she can't afford (gym, dance lessons, private college, dining out, brand clothes, designer make up) and when she can't make ends meet she cries and gets furious and gets super frustrated that she can't live like this because she needs these things. \nShe always calls me when she's having a break down. But the truth is now every time the phone rings and it's her I don't wanna take the call. Because I know what she's gonna say, and no matter what I tell her, and how much she pleads for my advice she's gonna get upset that I don't understand her and she's not gonna take any of it. She's gonna go back to doing the same thing, having the same results, and then calling me to complain all over again. I love her dearly, I really do. And I feel guilty for even thinking about it but the thing is I can't stand her any longer and don't know what to do.\nOur communication has been less frequent in the past few months, but when we talk it's always about the same things. \n\nTL/DR A friend of 14 years has entered a vicious circle of behavior and is frustrated I don't understand her and makes negative comments about the things I share with her and I don't wanna end our friendship but I can't take it anymore.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We were in the same friend group in which there was a bit of dating around (there are both girls and guys in our friend group, all are straight), so our group has gone through our fair share of falling-outs, beef, hatred, tensions, you name it. Don't get me wrong though, we all share lots of love too, but anyways me and my best friend have always been pretty solid and we've only gotten closer and closer throughout the years.\n\nBefore anyone comes to say, \"People of opposite genders can't be 'just friends',\" I assure you we definitely are. We've always agreed never to date for the fear of losing our friendship, since our respective dating pasts haven't been the greatest. (not that we'd ever end up dating anyways, i'm pretty sure we don't have feelings [oh and he also has a gf atm who is super sweet and is okay with how close me and him are which is great]) But anyways, what I'm trying to get at is that he is one of the closest friends I've ever had. I consider him to be one of my soulmates, my other close friends (who are girls if that's important to know) joke that we're platonically married. (i believe in multiple kinds of soulmates btw) He just gets me. He's with me through thick and thin, through every bad relationship, sad days, and happy days. I know I can open up to him about anything with no judgment and he will give me advice that is truly what he believes is best for me, even if i don't want to hear it. He knows when it's a good idea to approach me about an issue and for me to open up and when he should back off. I consider him to be closer than family and I can confidently say he knows me better than I know myself. It's like he can read into my thoughts that I didn't know I had and can feel every emotion I feel and have an explanation for why I feel that way. There's a lot of love in our friendship even though we might not show it all that often. He is my perfect best friend.\n\nSo I've been rambling for a while so I'll get to the problem. So we will be moving on with our lives and heading to college eventually. I recently asked him where he thinks he will go and he said he doesn't know yet, which is completely fine, but also that he will probably stay within our state. I, on the other hand, know what I want to major in already and what path I want my life to go in and my dream area for college is on the complete opposite side of the country. Honestly, I'd be okay with staying in our state and apply to the same schools so we can stay as close as we are right now. We've even previously discussed moving in together if we're in the same area since it'd be so convenient. The schools in our state are perfectly good, some of the best in the country, but I also love the idea of east coast schools. \n\nIs it worth it to stay here in order to stay close to him? On one hand, its my future and the universities there are great (but its also a very real possibility i wont get accepted) and on the other hand its one of my soulmates. It won't be the same not seeing him, and I've moved around before and I know how hard it is for me emotionally and mentally to lose someone and how hard it is to keep a long distance friendship. I'm super conflicted because I know I won't ever meet someone like him again. Please help.\n\ntl;dr i'm really worried thinking about the idea of me and my best friend seperating for college, but my education would still be good if i just stay in our state to be close to him. all advice accepted thank u", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I just called her to tell her something, and she just seemed so disinterested and cold. She asked me how my exam went and seemed pissed that I didn't answer which was my fault honestly I'm so shit at answering her with text messages. The whole conversation was so stiff and forced, I felt like running away from my laptop and crying because she knows it too. I've been putting it off for so long, I just didn't wanna admit that we aren't the same people anymore. We don't try hard enough, we only hang out when we need to use each other (like, let's go out I wanna buy books, or let's go out I need new jeans). And the thing is that we don't have anybody else but each other. I have other friends and they aren't as good as her, they're even assholes sometimes but I prefer their company more and I don't know why. I feel like I can be more real with them, I don't know though I don't really have a lot of really good and close friends. With my bf it feels like I'm the only one speaking and that all the jokes fall flat and that I can't even listen to her speak and everything she does irritates me. She genuinely makes me aggravated sometimes, it's just little things like she'll make a comment like 'oh, I eat so shit at your house', or 'i come to your house clean and leave dirty.' And I wouldn't care, but we have been friends for about three years and I have literally been to her house twice and it upsets me, makes me feel unwanted and like why does it always have to be my house. It hurts me when she says that, it hurts me when my mum asks me why I don't go to her house. It's because she never invites me. She has a fear of rejection but I never turn her down when she initiates a hang out session unless I can't because I'm busy or working etc. I was feeling really depressed for half a year, I had the worst year this year, I felt pathetic I felt so pathetic and I wanted to tell someone how I felt and I felt that I could never tell her. But one day I just spilt out my guts to her, everything I said was so personal. It was my 19th birthday and nobody did anything for me it was the breaking point and I wished I never existed because I genuinely felt worthless. I told her everything and she responded once and said she didn't know how to help me and then when I texted her back she ghosted me for a week. It was the worst week of my life, I had just told her something so personal and she couldn't even reply back to me, I am horrible at texting but when something bad happens to a friend I'll always text back, or I used to. Now I can't bring my self to care anymore, I try to tell myself that she's going through stuff too. But it all just feels so one-sided. On her birthday the year before I organised a group gift for her as well as a really large private gift. I spent so much time, money and energy and love on it. But this year no one asked me to do anything for my birthday despite the fact that I got everyone birthday gifts and organised group events with my friends for my birthday no one did anything for me. A week after my birthday she asked me what I wanted. That's when I cracked because even though I tried to convince myself that I didn't care I did. And I know how ungrateful I sound, but I never get anything that I give in return. I cried my entire birthday, I had to beg my mother to go out with me, I didn't even get a birthday cake. I didn't even make a wish, because I didn't have one. I wanted to go ice skating with my friends but I guessed that they would probably organise something for me anyways as I did for them. But they didn't, half didn't even manage a simple happy birthday. My best friend ignored me for a week, and when she finally texted me back it was because she needed me. Because a guy texted her asking her out, so she gave me the half-assed apology and excuse that she didn't know how to answer. And I forgave her but I also never did. But it haunts me till this day because she broke me. Something died between us that day permanently. We hung out a couple of weeks later, and we were on a train and I was talking to her like friends do and she was so embarrassed by me that she didn't respond. It was like talking to a wall in a cramped train where everyone could hear and feel and see the rejection. I was humiliated. I felt like the people around me thought, why is this girl, friends with *her* she's so embarrassing. I decided to never speak on a train with her again. Other friends are loud and goofy. They're comfortable with each other, can be goofy. They can sleepover in the same bed and not be disgusted by their friend. They go to each other's houses. They're there for each other. Friends aren't friends by default, because there was nobody else.\n\nAnd this is just my side, this is a mutual thing this is just my side, I cannot speak for her but I just know that we are drifting. We are so far that we can't hear each other. Passive-aggressive, irritated, un-empathetic. I never wanna talk to her first, I never text her first. She's not the first person for anything anymore. And I want to fix it but the more I write about it the lesser and lesser I want to. I feel like the only thing holding us together is how long we have been a friend and the fact that we don't want to lose another friend. Because we don't have anyone but each other.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

It doesn't matter what it is, be it love, friendship, or a discord community .\"Sic Parvis Magna\" - Greatness from small beginnings. This discord intends to stay smaller (think: 30-40 people) with an emphasis on building long lasting relationships with people who are not only like-minded, but share an interest in genuinely connecting over time. If you're just passing through, this discord won't be ideal for you. We cannot promise you will meet girls/guys here who you will click with if that's also what you're looking for. Hopefully you're somebody who wants to make real friends, eventually meet up, talk everyday, etc. all that stuff.\n\nThe current members of the discord are from another discord, we know each other very well. What does this mean for you? Well, it means not only do we have this type of experience, but we will also do our best to connect with you. This means if you're a shy type, we don't care. Extrovert? Great, you'll fit right in. Some of us play games, some do not, this is definitely not that type of discord. Since we're talking about creating connections with people, we do expect you to be not only real, honest, but we hope that you are willing to voice as well. Why? Real connections occur when real effort is put out. Text is great, and often times we can only text, but we want to get to know you. Talking over voice is a good way to do this, and I believe that it's the only way to get really close to somebody.\n\nThis discord is very small currently, you will be here at the beginning (and hopefully) for a long time. If you're looking for a very active discord, this is not that currently, though eventually it will be. If you're looking for good friends, chattin shit, banter and finding people long term to talk to, meet, etc, this is for you. Some things about the people in here: We banter, a lot. We make dark jokes, we typically don't view things as sacred bar certain topics, we definitely expect you not to bully people, and we expect you to put actual effort in to creating connections as it's the whole point of this discord. Ideally you are: Genuine, can banter, will not disappear (if we see a lack of effort we will simply remove you.), would like to voice, not an internet personality, etc.\n\nplease PM me if you're interested, thanks.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

He and I got along so well, or so I thought, that we never needed any explanation for our deeds or even have any misunderstanding in all the years, (except the later 2). He was literally by my side always, from Childhood till the 10th grade, then things changed a little for he changed schools and I remained in place.\nMy school is considered a very prestigious one, if not the most, in the city and is usually the at the top in every competition, be it academic, sporty or even co curricular. It is elitist to be honest, but not without good reason. The problem is that it also means the students often demean other students from lower ranking schools and one particular school is widely frowned upon by the people unanimously. The school in which this friend of mine went because of some academic reasons.\nWe had excellent communication even during 11th and even though he was teased for \"being with the lowly\" we only did it as a joke and he expressed the same sentiment. Remember I said he was my best friend since childhood? Well, then a best friend should at least know about another best friend's life, right? WRONG.\nI found out in 11th that he, sometime in 9th and again in 10th had two relationships with some random girls that I had never even heard of. I was quite shocked because I was informed about this not by him, but by a new random girl that I found out he was into and so I sometimes casually chatted with her.\nWith my newly found knowledge I confronted my \"best friend\" and he was at a loss for words. It was a little saddening but things went on, he explained the whole story and was ultimately 'forgiven'. But I was broken, dude.\n12th came upon us and our lives changed drastically. I was usually a silent and quite lame student but in my last year, I turned things around. I became the swimming team's captain and won accolades, got interschool recognition in dramatics and even scored a hot girlfriend. Basically I was on an all time high and it might've showed in my attitude as well for I started treating my \"best friend\" a little lowly. That's arrogant, yes I know. He wasn't riding the high train that year and didn't do so well at school either. I never liked his girl as well and I told him that constantly.\nWe grew apart a little and I realized it but the thing is, I was pissed at him because I constantly kept getting new information about his life from other sources and this super secrecy from your \"best friend\" was something which saddened me, and it came out in the form of insults.\nWhen we graduated we eventually reconciled and even went for night parties together but the spark seemed missing. Now every time we talk, it's always me trying to ask about his life and he being mostly, \"hmm, yeah, that's right, what can be done?\" Etc. There's little back and forth, we both drooled over some fandoms but that excitement in him seems dead.\nYesterday was his birthday, I called at midnight, probably his first birthday wish and we just talked like it was a formality. I constantly kept trying to lengthen the conversation by asking about him and joking about things and stuff but there was so little reciprocation of my excitement that I actually felt sad. \nSo here we are now.\nWe talk 2-3 times a month, always because I initiate the conversation and keep it up till I can, sometimes it's just me blabbering. I don't try to demean him anymore, it was just a phase thing, and instead even show interest in his life, even though I still despise his girlfriend.\nI'm the one who's actually trying to hold the knots and don't care about the past but it's like he's not interested in amends because his interest always seems divided.\nHelp me please because I really want to make things normal again.\n\nTL;DR- Best friends since childhood, had some fallouts in 11th and 12th grade, made amends, still talk, but it's always me trying to uphold the convo. Please provide any advice on what I can do to make things normal.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I have bipolar and sometimes I don't Express myself correctly. This is why I'm asking for advice and asking if I'm the toxic one in our friendship. After going through a lot of sucky circumstances like foster care and a shelter I finally had my own place a decent job. While going through the sucky stuff I started to noticing things I didn't like that my friend would do. Like back handed complements or being overly sexual in public while we were together. Sometimes she would complain to me about very small things and I would get angry at it. Example I'm about to miss curfew at the shelter(which leads to getting kicked out) due to train traffic after getting out of class and she's complaining about not having hot water to shower with. I definitely lost it on that occasion. She has a tendency to blame everytime I have a problem with her on my bipolar. Even if she clearly does something wrong. One Christmas I invited her to my ex boyfriend's mother's house since she didn't want to be with her family. At one point I noticed she was flirting with him. Me and him were not together but we were trying to fix things between us. She did not know that. His mom noticed it to and immediately tried to change subjects and the atmosphere. I confronted her and she got mad and again said I was crazy and my bipolar is acting up. But this time I had a witness which was my ex's mother. She then starts to say she just doesn't realize when she's flirting. Another occasion a few years later I start a casual relationship with her cousin that I've had a crush on since high school. She got extremely mad but I didn't care and still did what I wanted (yes that in itself was very bad) she told me then that as long as it's just sexual and not a real relationship she doesn't care and if it crossed that line she would stop talking to me. Her cousin ended up getting a girlfriend  which hurt me cuz I was really into him at that point. Around my birthday we were all hanging out. Me her and her cousin and she asked him when was the family going to meet his girlfriend and asked to see a picture of her and tried to show me. I didnt look at it and just passed him the phone. We started drinking and I ended up telling her I fell for him. 4 hours later while I'm sleeping she had sex  with him on my bed right next to me. After I start screaming and telling both of them to leave she refuses to leave I'm hungover so I let her stay. She tried to say she thinks he roofied our drinks which I immediately tell her to stop cuz we both knew we were just fine and it was just a regular hangover. She was pretty sober after he left ... no drugging was involved. She than started to claim I set her up because before us hanging out he texted me if he could come knowing she was going to be with me and I told him to ask her if he could come cuz if I did she would say no. Did I set her up cuz I did that? Why would I think two cousins would have sex?  The reason she knows about the conversation was cuz she had my Facebook password without me knowing. And months before the incident she had been going through all of my messages with all my friends. When I confronted her she proceeded to say her famous lines. My bipolar is acting up and I need to go on my meds. Later on she admitted to it. She keeps telling me her friends keep telling her that we are both toxic to eachother because when she has shitty circumstances with guys I end up trying to give her advice and she thinks I attack her. Saying I'm calling her stupid which I never do. I always tell her she knows all that I've been thru so I have no right to judge anything she does with guys I say things cuz I'm worried she'll get hurt and nothing more.

But I\u2019ve been very limited by parents by not being given a car, and my past friends from elementary school are all party people. I never got around to having a lot of friends. Anyways I met another homeschool girl when I started homeschool, but until last year, we became best friends, grew really close, shared our most deepest secrets, went out to parties, tried weed, gave each other relationship advice, etc. Everything you could imagine. But she went on a whole family trip to Texas for a month last December, and got pretty disconnected, I didn\u2019t mind but I did miss her presence. She took her time to speak to me again after her trip. Started going out as usual for 3 months, then she went on a trip to Mexico. And from there we lost touch basically, I reached out several times but she only put up excuses, that was back in MAY, then we lost touch again, didn\u2019t really care. And then until august she invited me to a Christian retreat (???) she was only looking for someone decently fun to go with her. Big mistake saying yes. That\u2019s when I decided I\u2019ll never put up again with her Christian events, ever. Anyways there she told me her parents kinda force her to text me, that they tell her she can\u2019t lose me as a friend and such. I felt that her parents like me more than she does. We don\u2019t even text anymore, im living my own life, I have a new friend who has the same name as her (a fun coincidence, I knew my new friend a long time before her).

I\u2019m happy for her. Truly, me seeing her happy, makes me beyond ecstatic. she\u2019s been depressed for such a long time, and since I first met her, she\u2019s made some hugeee progress. I\u2019m soooooo proud of her, y\u2019all don\u2019t even understand. she\u2019s been hanging out/talking with ONLY them. listen man, I get it. new guy and new friends, that\u2019s something to be excited about. I\u2019d totally be fine if she hung out with them 75% but still made some time for me. however, she NEVER talks to me anymore. I\u2019m the only one making an effort in this friendship. i was here before everyone else, I was here through EVERYTHING. all those late night mental breakdowns, all those times she thought she was worthless, e v e r y t h i n g. and then I get replaced like I didn\u2019t even matter in the first place \n\n2) her birthday was a few days ago. she was planning a separate bday party. my friend talked with her today, asked her about it, she said she might not have one this year. that\u2019s cool, I asked her about it because I needed to know whether or not I would have to plan around it. she said, and I quote, \u201c oh yeah, I might just invite a few friends instead\u201d.  so after everything we\u2019ve been through, I\u2019m not even invited to her birthday?! \n\n3) everytime I confront her about it, she blames it on something. one example is saying she doesn\u2019t have enough time. there\u2019s ALWAYS enough time to give a simple \u201chey\u201d or \u201chello\u201d. \n\ni love her so much. drifting apart from my past best friends has been so easy. but her. i don\u2019t want to give her up. she\u2019s the only person who\u2019s ever gotten me completely. she\u2019s my soul sister. she\u2019s supposed to be my maid of honor at my wedding, my kids favorite auntie, we\u2019re supposed to haunt all of our grade school bullies from beyond the grave together. im hurt. and i don\u2019t know how to tell her. can someone please help? \n\npeople keep telling me that I need to accept that I\u2019m losing her. but that\u2019s just not the truth. i lost her a long time ago.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

But recently she asked me to show her my conversation with him, I didn't want to because I know she doesn't like that we talk, they had already fought that day. To add to it, the last time I mentioned that he had messaged me, she got mad, and asked him about it, and he then got mad at me because I told her, when I already knew she doesn't like us talking, but it was by accident,  I wasn't thinking. So because of that, the choice I had was show her the message,  and make them fight, or not show it to her, and end up making her think I was hiding something. I chose to wait, because my friend had already left, I couldn't ask him if it was okay, and if I showed it to her, and she got mad, he'd be angry with me, because I know what happened before, but I did it anyways. And because I only trust him, between the two, if someone had to be angry at me, I'd rather it was her, because she already is pretty fake, I'm used to it. But because I didn't want to show her, she got suspicious, and he got mad at me, and she's ignoring me, but I know someone would be mad whatever I did. And their relationship has been quite shaky for a while now, so there's added stress for everybody. So the question is: what do I do to at least make him forgive me?\nNote: we all know each other only online, I can't do anything in person", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Fair enough, I feel Fred went to some trouble to get my info but never messaged me or anything so I left it.\nNo big deal, it's been the best part of 6 years. \n\nBut FB got too much for me last week.

He didn't even do that when we were friends. He sees the stories immediately too.  And I'm freaking out, I thought I was past this, past him, past this petty social media BS. But apparently not. I want to message him but I can't bring myself to go down that road again. I feel he should message first and apologise. But on the other hand is he waiting for me because I'm the one who cut him out? \n\nI'm a firm believer in fate and all that 'if it's meant to be' BS sadly. It seems too coincidental that Fred has suddenly reared his head. \n Fred was literally my rock and I've been feeling a little isolated and missing friends who never bother to message to see how I'm doing lately. I don't want romantic involvement from him. But to just feel like I have a friend who really knows me would make a difference in my mental state. But I dunno If he'll just ignore the message, leaving me feeling even more lonlier in the world. I couldn't take that again. I just don't know what to do.\n\nYes im pathetic I know. But I have no one else I can discuss this with. If you can even just talk it out with me, I'd appreciate it...TIA for anyone who bothers to reply", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We don't always have similar interests, but we've always loved each other and communicated really well, so we are super close.  However, lately it seems like she is totally avoiding me and I have no clue why.\n\nFor the last three years, I've been attending college in a town a couple hours away from where we grew up, while she still lives at home.  Naturally, this means that we don't get to physically spend much time together, but we've always been good about staying in touch, even when we're both super busy.  Additionally, we are sure to hang out at some point every time that I have the chance to come back home.  I get to live at home over the summer also, so we hang out all the time then.  We've also always talked about moving in together after I graduate college, which will be this May.  Basically, we've made the best of our long-distance friendship up to this point.  \n\nStarting a couple of months ago, though, she kind of stopped replying to my messages, or would send one-word lazy responses.  So I start texting her less often.  A few weeks ago, I was going to be back in my home town for a few days, so I let her know in case she wanted to see me.  She said that she did, and we even made plans to meet at a semi-specific time, but then she \"fell asleep\" and we didn't get the chance to see each other at all.  She apologized, and I told her it was alright, but it kind of hurt my feelings.  \n\nLast week, I got some really good news and texted her about it.  She left me on read.  That really hurt.  \n\nYesterday was my birthday.  She didn't text me at all.  \n\nI have no idea if I did something wrong or what.  We've never really fought about anything.  If there's something major going on in her life, she knows she can talk to me about it.  We both have struggles with depression, so I'm very understanding if she's just not feeling up to talking, but I can't really do much to check up on her since I live so far away.

We started talking at the end of 7th grade and we became best friends in the middle of eighth grade. We told each other just about everything and outside of school we'd do other things for fun. She introduced me to tons of new things that I enjoyed as well. She was also very open to me about her depression and even told me I helped talk her out of suicide once. During the summer, we mainly stayed in touch through text and our connection didn't start to wane or anything. However, all of a sudden, near the end of August, she blocked me on Snapchat where we usually text. I thought maybe she logged out and forgot her password again, so I waited. A few days later, I texted her on my phone's SMS. No response. Then at the beginning of September, I tried again. This time, she asked me to \"please stop talking to her.\" I was beyond confused. I just replied that I was hurt by what she said. Then, she says that she needs space. So, I gave her space. I didn't know how much she needed thought, but almost a month later she still hasn't tried talking to me. I went to Google Hangouts since she most likely blocked me on the SMS, too. I asked her if we were still friends. She read the message and then blocked me again. At this point, I'm super desperate for an answer. I went to my other friend for help who goes to the same high school as her. However, he didn't seem to care much. He only cared about his relationship with her and he was so quick to change the subject whenever I talked about her. He did tell me, however, that it was something I said. I couldn't think of anything I said to her that made her react like this. In fact, our last conversation we had was about when she was on a cruise with her other friends. Also, I would never say anything that would jeopardize our relationship like this. Anyway, fast forward to the end of October where I decided to email her through the email that our schools provided for us since we're in the same district. I sent her a message explaining my concerns, begging for an answer about why she did all of this. And what I got back was \"Can you just leave me alone\". I was baffled. I got angry, trying so hard not to victimize myself in this situation and replied explaining that I'm just trying to find closure. Then she goes, \"Block exists.\" I'm just so confused as to why she's being so rude. I replied asking that question and how I'm just nicely explaining how I feel. Then she goes on to tell me how our friendship was basically a lie and that I wasn't good for her mental health. I couldn't even make sense out of this. Our relationship was definitely not one-sided. We were both happy. I tried to act like I understood and she still tried to push me away. I refused to stop talking to her because I still don't know what I did wrong. Then, in a very snarky way, she says \"Well I'm done talking about this soooo\". I just gave up at that point. I know how stubborn she is, but I didn't think she'd be THIS stubborn. It's like there's not even a reason and she's just suddenly had a change of heart. Once again, I turn to my other friend for help. He says that she was talking about how much she \"hates me\" in school and then he said \"ha\". Like what the hell? That was so rude and out of pocket. I'm going to try to summarize this situation because I don't want to get too into it, but basically he's obviously on her side but won't admit it. He told me he got a \"sneak peek,\" as he called it, as to why she did all of this, so I refused to talk to him until he told me what she said, but it ended up being useless information about something I did that was annoying but not the reason as to why she ended our friendship. He got mad because I \"used our friendship\" to get this information and so I tried, once again, explaining how I felt and how I deserve an explanation. He said that he understood and blah blah blah and we're friends again or whatever. We still talk to each other regularly.\n\nNow it's November, and she and I still aren't friends. Since August, I've been so bored since I don't have anyone to talk to about with the things we talked about.

Hi! I've been battling mental health issues since I was in middle school, and I'll be graduating high school soon, and it isn't looking good. I was active in therapy before I moved across the country this summer, and I feel so alone now. It's hard having to start all over when everyone has already made these friends since elementary school, and I come in right before we all leave for college. I feel like I'm coasting by, alone, and I can barely get out of bed as a result. The work has become increasingly harder, I've already had to change two classes to a lower level, and today I've been informed I need to drop from Honors once again. I feel like such a failure. I've always had issues with pleasing people, needing to feel like I've been a good noodle ya know, and watching my mother sigh in disappointment makes me want to rip my heart out. I've been told I have such sad features, a boys face,  a \"different\" look for a girl in this town and I feel disgusted with myself. My family and I moved to this little rich town in the northeast, so my step-dad can be close to work in the city, and the way girls act here is very different from my old southern home and they're not very quiet about it. I just feel so lonely. My grades are suffering. My parents won't book me an appointment with a professional since they say my mom's battle with alcoholism comes first, which I agree with! She needs help and I want her to get better, but I can't keep bottling everything up. Hence, why I'm here. I don't want to hurt myself. I want to be better. But, I can't keep doing this every day. It hurts. I don't want to make people feel worried about some teenage stranger, not my intentions at all, but I need some sort of outlet. I'm such a fuck-up and can't keep letting down the people I love. I just want to feel better when I look in the mirror and not cry and call myself a pussy when I can't find it in myself to give up. \n\nThank you if you even read this, you help me feel not as alone :)", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Not because it was ordained by any external creed, internal insecurity, or lack of option, but because it was their informed-choice to do so; their way of demonstrating that future devotion. I still believe in such a person. \n\nHowever, it seems the only other people who follow a similar-model to myself are those who do so due to religious-practice (I'm agnostic), those who have issues with intimacy (been to therapists; they say that isn't the case) or those simply haven't had the opportunity to get intimate with another (I've had offers). \n\nI'm here to see if there is some sort of community for people like me, or others who might feel the same way I do (i.e. reserving physical intimacy due to non-religious values). \n\nNot really here to get into a debate; just trying to find other people like myself.

Fast forward a couple weeks, the ensemble is now formed and is due for a rehearsal in the next week or so, and already has a few Christmas gigs lined up. All of a sudden, she starts dropping hints that she doesn't want me in the band.

At this point it's clear to me that she wants someone else for her project and I sigh and tell her that I'm no longer interested in playing for her, and she quickly responds \"ok but please come out to our gigs for support\". Here's the thing: I know music is competitive and I know she knows a few piano players who are better than me, which is totally fine, I just wish she respected me enough to tell me that I'm not right for the band and she's choosing to go with someone else as opposed to manipulating me into taking myself out. I'm just kicking myself because I've done so much for this person. When she was in the hospital, I skipped class to buy her food and take care of her, when she was feeling depressed I'd go pick her up and take her out to dinner. I've given her countless rides and endless emotional support through thick and thin, and was starting to consider her to be one of my closest friends, and it sucks that she (intentionally or unintentionally) hurt me.

How do you y'all do it? Especially when voice chatting with a stranger for the first time and for the more introverted people, how do you do it? Like do you just talk, get to know one another until either one gets bored? Do you always know what to say instantly the moment the other asks a question? Is it often a constant back-and-forth conversation between the two of you? Does it ever get awkward at one point that you'd end up finishing the call quickly?  And what happens then? Would you stop talking to them because you didn't have an interesting enough conversation with them while voice chatting?\n\nI feel like I'm literally the one and only person here that doesn't feel comfortable with voice chatting. This has been bothering me for a while and it's hindering me from making potential friends since I always think the other person would ask to try voice chat/call at some point and I feel like I'd be unfair since I most likely wouldn't able to do it. Then there's also the matter of me having to converse in English when I've never done so at all outside of school so my family would probably be suspicious when they find/hear me suddenly talking to someone while speaking English rather than my native language. I know I shouldn't care what my family would think but I do and it's complicated, lol.\n\nI've always felt anxious even with phone calls because often I wouldn't immediately know what to say or that I'd have a hard time understanding what the other person said bc of my hearing issues and I'd have to ask them to repeat themselves and embarrass myself all the more. Which is why I prefer just having a normal chat since I'd have time to think of my response and not have to worry about giving someone a half-assed reply because of my uncooperative brain. Honestly in general, I'd much rather talk to someone in person rather than through phone calls... unless I'm already friends/family with that person, then I'd be more willing to do calls with them.\n\nThis is a legitimate question so please no harsh judgments.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

People try to tell me that my voice matters, but considering how much I'm ignored on a daily basis, I doubt so. Anyway, Jon texts me this morning, says he longer wants to be friends. I tried to console him the other day when he was feeling down on himself, so that's the most I can figure out. He says it's him, that he's a sh***y person, but I don't know what to believe anymore. This is coming off of a summer where two people who initially treated me as a friend became suddenly distant, one of them even blocking me on social media, without saying a word to me about it. Silence speaks louder than words, and in my case, gunshots and trains. The worst thing about silence is that I can't decipher it. I feel deaf to it, like it's a noise everyone gets but me. I'm supposed to be apathetic towards it by this point, but apathetic people have a large circle of friends that they can be apathetic with. *I don't.* What I essentially have are a handful of people I bump into every now and then and say \"hi\" to. I don't really hang out, often. Everytime I've tried to ask someone to hang out, they're either busy or forget about it on the day we're supposed to hang out. The worst part about living with my parents is that I have to live with *him*. I once considered *him* a best friend, but *he's* supposed to be my brother, by this point. I don't like being home while *he's* around because I really don't like having to be around that. He talks on the phone with friends constantly, on occasion gets a girlfriend, leaves to hang out frequently, is living a life I would have killed to have parts of. I've been told not to compare myself to others, but I can't help it sometimes. I don't really have anyone else to compare myself to at this point, so I've been more insecure about myself as of late. \n\nI really, really don't have many friends. It's a miracle I'm holding myself together, at this point. I'm aware that I'm clingy and it scares the ever loving hell out of me. That's what got my girlfriend to break up with me last winter. My therapist says it's part of the autism, but I feel conflicted on that. I've been told that I don't make enough attempts to reach out to the people I know, and that's partially true. On the other hand, not enough people make an effort to reach out to me. It sounds picky, yes, but these are supposed to be my friends. I have at least one person I can consider a friend right now, but god knows where that's headed. One day she might decide I'm not that interesting anymore and I'll be back to square one.  I know because it's happened before. I know because I'm autistic and having people outright reject me when I need a friend has just kind of been a motif in my life.\n\nI'm here because I just really need a friend, somebody to talk to, anyone. I feel like I've lost it by this point.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Disclaimer: all that lurking was done on other accounts, this is just a new one, specifically for this post !!!*\n\nI may say that I have experienced all these friend making subreddits and I am here to help you find friends!\n\nHere are some tips and tricks that can help you in hunting a friend, especially when you are kinda awkward (like me):\n\n1. Your post\n\nI am not an expert on this ,but it is crucial for you to specify any special request (age, timezones and all that stuff).\n\nYou have to seem as you would want other people to perceive you, without changing your personality (lying isnt good y'know, even tho you want to be the most outgoing person in the world,when in reality you are shy. Love yourself my guys).\n\nMaybe try to put as many interests of yours as possible, so you can have a conversation on those things and hit it off.\n\n2. First messages\n\nAll friendships that I've started on reddit started with us just basically quoting memes. Literally. And I didn't have that much in common with those people ,we were just having fun.\n\nBut there were people that I had almost everything in common and we didn't end up friends. Not even acquaintances. Nothing. Ended up not talking,tho I found their post very intersting or they liked mine.\n\nLemme tell you why. The conversation with my friends went smooth because we started to right.\n\nRemember when I said \"hello there\"? Friend responded with \"general kenobi\" and then we just continued with memes until we got tired and went on other topics. We liked each other and continued talking and now I have friend. (Yay!!)\n\nBut most conversations with people that I had stuff in common were like:\n\n\"Hi\n\nHey!\n\nHow are you?\n\nGood, wby \n\nI'm good too\n\nSoo, tell me something about yourself?\n\n*awkward silence*\n\nI like x,y,z.\n\nCool, I like x too. Heard of (insert something related to x).\n\nNope.\"\n\nAnd that was all most cases. Maybe it was me, I never knew how to describe myself. My advice is just to be interested and try to spice it up.\n\nIn my experience saying something that may be a conversation starter is better. And. Not. Responding. Good. When. You. Dont. Necessarily. Feel. Good. Is. Way. Better.\n\nYou can say something along the lines \"I'm good, a little sad, I just finished this book and it was so sad\". Or whatever you feel at the moment. It may start a conversation about books or something. \n\nBeing involved is the key.\n\n3. This should be platonic\n\nThis is for friends, so it is better to keep it that way. At least at first. \n\n4. More messages\n\nNow you have someone that might be your friend. You don't know if they feel the same and you dont know what to do. \n\nMy wonderful advice: ask them. Sounds like kindergarten, but communication is hella cool my guys.\n\n5. Take care of your friend\n\nSend them cute cat videos when they sad. Remind them how much you like them, and how wonderful they are\n\n**** Not related\n\nI just made this new account for anonymity and for the sake of no one knowing my age and my gender.\n\nBut the actual reason is that I will probably be embarrassed by this in few days.\n\nAnd btw, as all foreigners say, sorry for my english.\n\nAnd it took me an hour to make that I care about you making friends.\n\n****\n\nAnd finally:\n\n6. Epstein didn't kill himself \n\nNow is time for you to quote memes and for us to be friends. \n\n\nXoxo\n\nMe.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

We have a lot of friends in common, but the opportunity never rose for us to talk to each other, untill I was close to graduating and he talked to me twice : once to say a few a words about my end of studies project, and once to joke with me ( which was awkward because I didn't think it was a joke at first, and took offense, untill he explained to me that he was just joking ). In both cases he approached me out of nowhere. By this time I had doubts that he may like me, but I didn't think much of it, and I forgot about him.\n\nA few days later he added me on Facebook, (probably found it through our common friends), and by then I started really thinking that he may like me, but I didn't really care, I just spoke to him as a friend.\n\nAfter a few messages he tells me I'm cute, says he wants to meet me, and asks for my number, which I refused to give, because I don't give out my number that fast. By this point it was clear that he wanted to go out with me. Anyway, he says I can get your number even if you don't give it to me, I say that he's acting creepy and we start fighting, he gets really rude and I block him.\n\nHe then messages me and calls me on my phone using my number (which I don't know how he got, our common friends said they didn't give it to him and I believe them) which I don't respond to and block his number.\n\nAfter talking about it with one of his close friends, which is also close to me, he tells me that he's not a bad guy and convinces me to unblock him, saying that he just doesn't know how to talk to girls, and that it wouldn't hurt to be distant friends with him.\n\nAfter I do this, he apologizes to me about the names he called me, and says he would be nice to me from then on. But then, out of nowhere, he starts fighting with me and calling me names again. Literally, out of nowhere. I was really confused at this point. I ended up blocking him again. But I can't stop thinking about him and trying to understand him.\n\nMaybe he was just lashing out because he was frustrated with the fact that I kept insisting that the only relationship we can have is friendship, or maybe he was just bored.. ? My friend told me that he's desperate to be liked back by a girl he likes, and that it never happened to him before.. Maybe he was taking out his anger and frustration on me ?\n\nI can't ignore his existence because I really love the friend we have in common, I can't be comfortable ignoring his closest friend. I keep wanting to either be friends with both of them or getting way from both of them. It's very hard for me. But I guess I can manage to remain friends with my close friend and ignore this guy. It's just that I can't get over unexplained rude and mean behavior from people.\n\nIt's been making me feel really bad the last couple of weeks and I really can't get over it.

THEY ARE DRIVING ME INSANE! PLEASE HELP! I stayed silent for too long and now u don't in w what to do... Aaaah\n\nContext: we bought our house about a year ago and are still busy with substantial renovations. I split my time between freelance work, volunteering, and doing most of the renovation work while my husband is doing 60+ hours a week in a physically demanding job to pay the bills.\n\nMy friends are staying here for the last month of their studies before one of them (they are a couple) is taking up a job in Germany in January.\n\nNow... We have had houseguests before. It's normally a delight. My husband and I both enjoy hosting guests normally. However...\n\n- ALL THE STUFF. EVERYWHERE. They brought with them literally everything they owned. A whole apartment worth of stuff. Stuff is everywhere. Random bags blocking my workshop, tons of boxes in my office, random stuff in cupboards. (Even though I made the entire conservatory available for their stuff) This doesn't only mess with my Feng Shui it also feels really disrespectful towards to fact that my life's purpose is currently to make this house liveable and they are hindering that substsbtially...\n\n- EATING EVERYTHING. they eat our food and partake in the meals we cook, as well as drinking our wine, beers, etc. I would not mind this if there was some reciprocation. We don't have a lot of money. Paying 10-20 \u00a3 extra per night on most nights adds up.\n\n- PISSING HEATING UP THE WALL. Windows are left wide open as a means of temperature regulation (even though they barely heated their own house because of the costs which they have mentioned several times since staying here). Nuff said. And yes, I did explain the heating to them...\n\n- VERY LITTLE CONTRIBUTION TO CHORES. they clean up after themselves if they use the kitchen to make something for themselves, but that's it. No help with cleaning up after my husband and I make dinner, or contributing to general household chores.\n\n- PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE NOTES. To be fair, it's only been a couple and I know that Germans have a different relationship to note writing than the British... But it's still rude and it's also not my responsibility to act as a social translator for people who have lived in the UK for years at this point\n\n\nHELP. I could go on.

Also keep in mind we are all adults. I am 24f. Kyle is 23 and Laura is 23 so this behavior is absolutely immature especially in the workplace. Basically Laura  from work came out to talk to me and told me that one of my friends (Kyle) is saying I said all she does is \u201crun her mouth and talks trash about everyone\u201d.  I confronted Kyle and he started crying and told me that what she was saying was true and he made it up. At this point I am extremely confused and I asked him why he would say that I said that stuff about her. Then he goes to tell me that she and him were hanging out  and she cornered him and asked him who at work talks trash about her and in his head he knew it was himself but he didn\u2019t wanna admit it to her so he thought of the next person that he trusted at work and it was me so he threw my name out there to protect himself. Pretty immature if you ask me.  Just another reason to distance myself from work people and keep them as strictly work people. You just never know if your so called friend is lying and making up things about you I guess. Thanks for anyone who listens to this.

There have been many times, over the course of our friendship, that made me sort of scratch my head. When she had finally met her future husband and she was planning the wedding, I was somehow so sure that she would ask me to be one of her bridesmaids. She never did ask. I was very surprised, as we were a regular part of each other's lives and I was very involved in her process in determining whether or not she should marry him. I'm not really a huge fan of being anyone's bridesmaid, I'll be honest about that, but it just surprised me and I was a little bit hurt because I thought she considered me one of her dearest friends. After she moved away, I had sent her a card just letting her know that her friendship meant a lot to me and stated things I appreciated about her. I was a little surprised when I never received any kind of acknowledgement of receiving the card. Is it possible she didn't receive the card? Maybe, but I doubt it. During the time that she was living here, I had gone through a horrible breakup and the guy that I was dating had really broken my heart. He never really acknowledged what he had done. Just a few weeks ago, I ran into him and he apologized to me for everything. I later texted her telling her I wanted to share with her what had happened. She sent me some text saying she was so happy to hear that and couldn't wait to hear what happened. What I tried to call her to share, she never answered, neither did she call me back. I never received any texts from her after that. I don't even know why I'm sharing all of this. I guess I'm just trying to understand it all and more than a little hurt that I feel I may be wasted a bunch of time on a friendship that maybe wasn't really anything.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Currently I'm studying my MA degree after having done a BA degree in English. So I am a bit busy most of the time because of homework and exams, but for the love of all the greatness in this world, don't feel discourage by that. Don't be deterred by it. \n\nIf this might encourage you, then I'm currently trying to learn Russian and French. I'm fairly interested in history; medieval, Ancient Egypt, Rome, WW2, British History (Scottish, Irish and Welsh as well) and the USA's history (from colonial to 1950). Do not expect me to be able to have a standing conversation in Russian. I can literal only say: \"Hello, my brother, how are you -- I have a cat and a table.\" In French I can only say; \"Hello, good bye - excuse me, I walk in the garden. And how are you?\" It's my hope to improve my English as well, especially so I can get rid of my accent and speak more British like.\n\nFurthermore, I inform you of that I'm also very interested in psychology, science, astronomy. \n\nWith that out of the way, mayhap, you can teach me something intriguing in regards to your own interest and maybe even some history knowledge you may have?

We are super close and I love her dearly but the past few years have been a struggle. She overshares everything....if she gets anything new - clothes, house stuff, makeup etc she calls me about it or text me pictures of it. She just got a new vehicle so I get the big text about it and a bunch of pictures, she\u2019s getting a new dog so everyday I get pictures of this dog (that she doesn\u2019t have yet) sent to me.

I am usually very supportive and give all the exciting feedback but I\u2019m getting to a point where I wanna throw my phone when I see her name pop up. I\u2019m very different from her when it comes to sharing, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to share every detail of your life with someone. I keep most things to myself. Usually with time people will see/hear about exciting things organically. Some things are exciting to share and I\u2019m not trying to shit on her excitement but it comes off incredibly brag-y. And the hard truth is I DONT CARE and pretending to care about all these details gets exhausting. I\u2019ve been her cheerleader for so long it\u2019s starting to feel like a job. To top it off she\u2019s incredibly sensitive so when I\u2019ve tried to address anything to her in the past she becomes this sad, crying victim who acts as if i just shot her dog in front of her. All she hears is negative mumbles and doesn\u2019t listen to the words.

It feels like she is my little child because she always follows me around, does meowing battles with me and always has an eye on me.

Sign up, if you want to get 10 cat pics per day. This subscription can only be cancelled after 30 days. Every attempt to cancel this subscription before 30 days will be punished by one additional cat pic per day.\n\nGreat introduction, right? No? Fine, I'll try again but this time with something more generic:\n\nIm 24 and from Germany. I'm an introvert and I enjoy being alone(well, with my cat of course). Small groups are fine too, but I can't handle stuff like parties because it's quite exhausting. Im currently studying some stuff, but I can't tell you what it is (I dont know the english word whoops)\n\n**Animes/Mangas:** I like watching animes and reading mangas so I'm always open for new stuff.  Animes I enjoyed the most: Death Note, HxH, Full Metal Alchemist, Bleach, Naruto, Boku no Hero Academia etc. I've been reading One piece for 7 years now, but haven't watched the anime for quite some time. Stopped in the middle of the WCI arc. Currently I'm more focused on normal series/streams.\n\n**Movies/Series/Streams:** I'm watching Dr. House and Supernatural atm, so we can talk about those, if you like them. Also I'm really looking forward to The Witcher since I like dark horror/thriller stuff, but have no friends that enjoy horror stuff. So I'd love to find someone to watch some horror stuff with. I love movies and series that focus on the human psychology like \"Lie to me\" or \"Criminal Minds\". It's just fascinating to me how humans work. Because it fascinates me so much, I read literature about behaviour, feelings etc from time to time. But around 80% of my media consumption is Twitch. I watch Sodapoppin, Lirik, Moonmoon and DansGaming. Its a huge plus for me if you like any of those guys.\n\n\"So, a strange introvert that likes being alone. He surely loves playing video games, right?\"\n\n\\*Ding ding ding\\* You are correct\n\n**Gaming:** I've got a Switch and a Pc with tons of games that you can play in multiplayer. So just write me your favourite multiplayer game and there will be a pretty high chance that we can play together. Its easier for me to get to know people by playing with them, so feel free to join me on my journey to *please enter your favourite universe here, I don't have a favourite one.* In terms of mobile games I've been playing Bleach Brave Souls for 2 1/2 years now.\n\n**Fitness:** I go the gym, just like everybody nowadays. I Had a bad injury that took 6 months to heal properly, so I basically lost years of progress. I'm starting at zero now, which is quite depressing. Bodyweight fitness and calisthenics is quite fun, but nbbody in my friend/gym circle shares that opinion. I also enjoy stuff like volleyball, badminton, climbing(haven't done that in years) and just doing sports in general.\n\nIt took me a lot of time and effort to write this down, since my english isn't that great, so I hope you enjoyed that small trip through my mind.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I\u2019ve been a relatively good student but i noticed i started catching some of her habits. So when it comes to homework assignments she will procrastinate everything to the last minute and end up pulling all nighters.

In the beginning of our friendship I don\u2019t really notice it until I was talking about my chest pains and she just said \u201cyou\u2019re fine i get them all the time too\u201d. I was shocked because she didn\u2019t even ask if i was okay (i might be over thinking this)\n\n3rd-Lastly she\u2019s very ignorant to issues POC face and as a POC i find it very offensive. Although she\u2019s a POC as well she easily passes as white. Anyway one time we were in a group and i was talking with another POC about the \u201cwhere are you from\u201d question and she just kept saying how it\u2019s not wrong to ask where someone is from, they just want to know.

Take what I say with a grain of salt, as this is my impression of how events have gone, but I am obviously a bit biased towards the situtaion. That being said, lets start.\n\nI am not a very extroverted person, so I only spend time with a small group of people and only really interact with them. My role in the group has become the 'carer' as time has gone on. I always seem to be taking care of one or all of them in some way, and I don't mind that. I make sure each person I doing okay, I actively listen to their interests and go out of my way to engage in those interests with them. This behavior of going out of my way to be interested in their hobbies is only one way though. Whenever I am invited to join one of them to do something, it is always something they want to do. They never express an interest in what I enjoy, or would like to do. Not a single one of them has ever taken an interest in what I was doing, unless it somehow benefits themselves.\n\nI also will often do something for one or more of them, just because I happen to think they might like it. I often bring back food to the room, or take them out to eat. (Nothing fancy as I am fairly poor, but despite this I still want to trat them now and then) I have never had one of them do something for me, just out of the blue, because they though I might like it, or becuase they just 'thought of me'.\n\nSome time ago last year one of them was having some difficulties due to stress, so despite my very busy schedule I took time to go on an outing with them. Myself, the person having the stress and another friend at my behest, took a day to remove the person from the stressful situation and help them recover. Whenever any of my friends has a stressful time, or needs a bit of attention, I am always there to help them with it. However, lately I have been struggling with stress and some slight depression, and not one of them has been engaged enough to notice and ask how I am really doing, let alone take time to help me out, like I have done for each of them repeatedly.\n\nI just don't know if I'm overthinking this, or if I am being selfish.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated, so please send people you know here if you see this, if you think they might have some advice.\n\nThanks :)", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I have tried studying alone, and I\u2019ve gotten a little bit down, but it\u2019s really difficult to learn a new language when I have nobody around me that speaks the language fluently. I\u2019ll give you a little description of myself and what I\u2019m looking for, and let\u2019s see what Reddit can do!\n\nFirst things first, I\u2019m a 20 year old guy from Louisiana, US. Since I was about 13 I\u2019ve had a deep intrigue about language and how it evolved over time. Well after doing a little research on the topic, I decided to try my hand at learning German. It was difficult, because I was young and naive. I didn\u2019t want to stick to it, and I was learning French in school already. Looking back, I regret not forcing myself to keep at it, because I believe that being bilingual is incredible. Recently, I\u2019ve got my mind set on where I want to be in life and what I want to do, and my chances of getting the career I\u2019d love are like 75% greater if I learn a second language.\n\nI\u2019m looking for someone who speaks German fluently. Male or female, preferably between the ages of 18 and 25. Mainly so there\u2019s a better chance we can get along and not just have a student/teacher relationship. I would absolutely love to grow a genuine friendship through this as well, and think it could help bolster my interest and capability of learning German.\n\nMy interests include, but are not limited to:\n\n1. Gaming\n2. History\n3. Existentialism\n4. Nature\n5. Travel\n6. Music\n7. Cooking\n\nI play PC a good bit and wouldn\u2019t mind also playing some video games with you as well. We could have study sessions like this if you\u2019re willing. I\u2019m more than willing to talk about history and have civil discussions about politics as well! I love talking about questions that people would rather avoid in conversation but end up thinking about while you\u2019re alone and looking up at the sky. Nature is incredible. The beauty of our planet is immeasurable and just gives me the greatest smile. Traveling is something I could do every day of my life. I love going to new places and exploring new cultures and will do so at any chance I get. I love all kinds of music, though I don\u2019t really have a preference. My playlist is filled with many random genres from rock to country to pop and soul. I love cooking. Creating things from scratch just makes me feel so accomplished and then eating it just makes me even happier!\n\nIf you think you fit anywhere in this criteria, please hit me up! I would love to try this out and see if it could go somewhere. Thank you for reading this far!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I suffer from depression and anxiety, both diagnosed, and sometimes I find quite challenging going to sleep. I turn, and turn, and turn in my bed, unable to sleep because my dear brain decided to remember me past things that ocurred or future events and other things. Then I feel stressed and I start thinking more and more about those things and the day arrives and I haven't slept a bit. Well, fantastic. \nIt doesn't always happen, but sometimes I have like periods when it is more frequently than others.\n\nThis said, there's the thing. Sometimes I make plans with my friends. Like going to places and other stuff. But if the night before I haven't slept a bit I feel quite challenging having to do anything with my confused brain, my exhaustion and a pair of gigantic bags under my eyes due to the lack of sleep. So I text the friend/s I had plans with and tell them I won't go due to this. Of course, if they have arranged schedules, I understand they could be a bit upset. And I apologize for that. But they already know my situation and still make plans with me. \nAnd then, there's THAT FRIEND. That friend that when cancelling themselves the appointment makes me guilty anyways because if they had go I would probably tell I couldn't due to lack of sleep. They always tell me things like \"I don't even know why I invite you anymore...\". I am always guilty. I feel that I always have to bring a damn camera like a documentary and record myself 24h a day so people can see that I'm not lying. Same goes if I had a last minute problem. Sometimes I have some really big last minute problem that literally seems like bullshit but that makes me arrive late and then, when I arrive at the appointment I am not believed and it's my fault (like a f**king movie, unvelievable but true). \n\nSo, I don't know what to do anymore, what to say anymore. This problem has taken so much signifiance in my life that is also another cause of my insomnia. This is a neverending story...\n\nWhat do you think? What should I do?

I'd love to have a few more close friends with folks who love the things I love!\n\nI'm an empath and I feel deeply - it makes me an attentive listener, and exceptionally appreciative of people who take the time to check in on me. So if you're looking for a friend who loves anime, manga, video games and various crafty things - someone who values checking in on their friends and appreciates it when my friends do the same, please, read on!\n\nMy name's K, and writing is my greatest passion! I love writing fantasy most of all - I'm currently writing up a gothic horror novel about a vampire who becomes subjugated by a witch after a failed attempt to kill her. During her stay in the witch's manor, she starts to question where her own loyalties lie... It's a suspenseful, spooky, sexy F/F tale - yes, everything I write it always very queer. &lt;3 I also love poetry! So if you do too, let's talk about our favs. &lt;3\n\nSo while I'm very much a writer and a poet at heart, there's other things I absolutely love too! I'm a big fan of anime and manga - some of my favorites are Revolutionary Girl Utena, Madoka, Rose of Versailles and Shirokuma Cafe. I'd love to hear what some of your favs are! As for manga, I'm trying to read all of the Sailor Moon manga - I loved the show as a kid, but I don't know the full story, you know? So I'm trying to get through all of the manga, so I can finally say, \"I've finally done it!! I finished Sailor Moon!\"\n\nI'm a big fan of video games as well - I'm currently playing Stardew Valley on Switch and starting anew! Would love to find someone who also plays on Switch so we can be Switch buds. &lt;3\n\nLastly, I used to be pretty crafty - I used to love knitting and crocheting, but after a hand injury, I really have to chill out with stuff like that while I recover. But, I absolutely love seeing crocheted lil amigurumis and plushies, and there's nothing more comfy than a hand-knitted scarf!\n\nThere's more to me than this, of course - I love tarot, I love collecting gems and crystals and rocks, and I consider myself a green witch of sorts! But we can talk about all of that fun stuff later! I mainly talk over Discord - so send me a message with some stuff we have in common &amp; your Discord name, and I'll add ya as soon as I can. &lt;3 I hope to talk with ya soon!\n\nEDIT: Please tell me a little bit about yourself in your response! I spent a lot of time writing this up, so if you can tell me about yourself so we can have a proper convo, that'd be splendid! I only say this because I've gotten a lot of messages saying \"inbox me\" or \"let's talk\" and I don't really know what to say to that. :/", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

After some months he told me that he was in love with me and that he saw me around the city when we were in high school and since that moment he was in love with me.  \n\nI was shocked but i told him that i appreciated his honesty with me for telling me that and the trust he had in me but I only saw gim as friend and i was\u00b4nt attracted to him, and that now that we trusted each othe I hoped that our friendship could continue and grow.\n\nThen the time passed and we kept became closer friends, he was always giving me presents or paying the dinner or drinks and I thought that was normal, he used to do that with his other friends, he was very kind. But sometimes when we were partying and drunk he used to hold my hand and get physical. At that point in my life I was very shy and didnt knew what to do or how to behave, so I chose to stay \"respectul\" and dont say anything about it, eventhough i was feeling unconfortable. I never really cared that people thought that i was gay or anything.\n\nMoments like that happened a lot, and then he started telling me more often that he loved me and i always thought that he meant thas as friends. After some time he got in a relationship and I thought that he accepted the fact that i only saw him as a friend, but there were times that he kept trying to hold my hand and tell him that I love him too. At that point i talked to him to make things clear and he said that he only loved me as friend and everything was ok.\n\nI tried to be for him in everything he needed but he became very clingy and at first I had a hard time saying no but then I started denying his invitations. And our friendship began feeling weird as everyone thought we were on a relationship and tried to take some distance. We stopped talking for some months and after that we started going out again with our group of friends. \n\nEverything was fine, he always invited me everywere and insited to pay for everything, he introduced me to some of his friends and was hooking up with a lot of guys, once again i thought \"ok its fine he doesnt want me to be his boyfriend anymore\". Then we started pretending to be boyfriends at parties because people thought we were cute and buy us drinks, but he took it more serioursly and kept on holding hand with me and trying to kiss him, but I stoped him because I wasn't feeling comfortable with the situation. \n\nAfter all of that I cared less and less about being nice to him and i ran out of patience, telling him no to everything or if we went out letting him pay for drinks, food or even trips, after all i thought he didnt respected me. After that we tried to work things out after all we were \"best friends\". For some time everything was normal we had fun and it felt like we could be friends.\n\nBut whenever a guy talked to me or I was with someone else, he was very jelous and mad, whenever we talked about it he denied it. Then I finally talked to him telling him everything I felt, the things I wasnt comfortable with and that i needed to be sure that he only saw me as a friend because i didn\u00b4t wanted to give him false expectations or hurt his feelings. He told me that he was still wanting me to love him as boyfriends and not friends, that I was the best person he ever met and the best thing to happen to him would be in a relationship with me. But he wanted accept that I only say him as a friend and we could move on.\n\nI thought everything was fine but he is still clingy and always  wants me to tell him that i love him, give him hugs or even kiss him and makes jokes about us being boyfriends or getting married and things like that. Everytime I see him I get anxious and I get defensive. I dont know if I should continue this friendship or leave it.

Asking for a friend who\u2019s not on Reddit.", "author": "cactusplanti", "self_text": "Hi all. I\u2019m asking this for a friend who\u2019s not on Reddit. It\u2019s an issue that has affected me in the past too, but since I moved, she\u2019s now dealing with it firsthand. \n\nWe have a mutual friend whom we\u2019re both very close to. We are all females in our mid-20s and have known each other since middle school. Our mutual friend still lives at home and doesn\u2019t have a license or car. I don\u2019t know the details for her financial decisions, but she works full-time, and still constantly depends on other people to give her rides to work, friend\u2019s houses, and outings. She will use ride share services sometimes but only as a last resort since they\u2019re too expensive for her. \n\nThe problem is that she constantly asks for rides from her friends. I used to pick her up and take her to work every day. When we\u2019d go out to the bar, I\u2019d have to pick her up and drop her back home. If she couldn\u2019t get a ride, she couldn\u2019t go anywhere because Uber/Lyft was too expensive and out of the question. \n\nSince I moved, my friend is now her go-to. Few examples: My friend just celebrated her birthday and our mutual friend still requested a ride to and from her birthday event. Last week, our mutual friend was out of work for the flu and asked my friend to take her to pick up her medication from the pharmacy. Our mutual friend often asks my friend to pick her up from work and take her to the store so she can go grocery shopping. Our friend pays back, whether it\u2019s some cash for gas or coffee on the way to work, but it\u2019s not really worth it. My friends are both invited to another friend\u2019s party this weekend, and our friend is still unable to find a way there so now my friend is responsible for picking her up and dropping her off, otherwise she can\u2019t go at all. \n\nShe\u2019s proven to be incredibly dependent and has no desire to save up money for a license or car. When asked about it, she says it\u2019s just unrealistic right now and she hasn\u2019t driven in several years anyway. And yet, this burden falls on the shoulders of her friends and family. \n\nWe have been driving our friend around for several years now, but always \u201csplitting the responsibility.\u201d Since I moved, my friend is at her wit\u2019s end being our friend\u2019s chauffeur. My friend loves her so much and doesn\u2019t want to be rude or leave her out to dry. She wants to help when she can but she feels tired and taken advantage of. \n\nWhat\u2019s the best way for her to approach setting boundaries without hurting our friend\u2019s feelings?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

In between, sometimes she'd get better (never fully recovered though). I've been there for the good and worse. So well that I've noticed patterns. I also work in the mental health care. I've noticed patterns about the type of poeple she liked to frequent (related to drugs -she has done hard drugs- and alcohol) and her unability to overcome her fears regarding her future (career paths that would make her happy and suit her totally but that require facing frequent rebuttals and management of expectations, I mean, like a lot of career paths really....).\n\nWhen she is not feeling well, I usually shut up and listen to her. Even if it's for an hour without interruption. But when she feels better (or I believe she does since she appears to be) and that she asks for my opinion, I give it. For example, career path : She says that she wants to have x goal but she talks about xxxxxx things that supposedly prevent her to do that, and I tell her \"Have you thought about making a concrete plan to reach that goal? Have you even tried? Look into it, calculate the money and see. Yes it will have you sacrifice a bit to reach it, but you don't know yet if you don't even try. Poeple do it all the time, I did it and sometimes I have to do it all over again. Why don't you try?\"\n\nThen I feel like her heart is sinking when I tell her that. On one hand I feel I might have gone too far and not have the best of approaches. One the other hand, she's been stuck in the same situation for years. When am I supposed to tell her anything?? How am I supposed to tell her??\n\nOur last convo was about a guy she is starting to see in the middle of her hospital visit period. First of all, I know her, the timing is off, not the right time to meet anyone remotely good for her. Second, she meets him on a website for guys looking to have an affair. And lastly, he works in the beer industry. She met him one time, dug into her past and told him intimate things. I listened to her religiously. We are changing the subject and stuff. Then she comes back to it and asks \"What do you think about my guy situation??\" and I tell her right away \"Look. I don't think it's a good idea. He's in the beer industry, he makes his own beer and probably drinks a lot. Do you think it'd be the right moment to have anything going on with a guy with that background? Plus, you met him on a scketchy site. Your last experience with that site were barely fulfilling, almost disturbing. Why don't you try tinder, or something that doesn't start on the basis of a lie someone tells their SO??\"\n\nShe told me that she doesn't think we can be friend anymore. She's my closest friend and it hurt me that she said this. I think she needs space , I'm willing to give her and I told her so. I also told her that she asked for my opinion, and I didn't feel like lying because I know her. And if she doesn't want to follow my opinion, she doesn't have to, I'll still support her. But I told her that I am not her therapist nor her mom and that I can be wrong too. I just wish her the best. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrankly I am also tired of walking on eggshells.

Not sure how to get it.\n\r\nI had a friendship fall apart about half a year ago. Backstory: I (26f) had a friend, let's call her Claire(26f) We met through a friend and Claire hooked me up with my current job where she worked. Over the next couple years we became best friends, attached at the hip. One of those friendships where you could tell each other everything, she quickly became like the sister I never had. Blah blah and all that mushy stuff. I have had some unpleasant friendships in the past as I can be taken advantage of quite easily (a flaw I am working on). I also suffer from a pretty severe chronic depression which has been tough for some people to handle so I had trust issues opening up to people about it.  Claire knew both of these things and was very supportive, saying she was different. Or so I thought. \r\nSome red flags I ignored: \r\nClaire and our mutual friend stopped hanging out, our mutual  friend told me she just didn\u2019t feel good about herself after hanging out with her. I justified it in my head that Claire had some mental health issues herself and was recovering from a very severe eating disorder. And we were both helping each other with our struggles. \r\nWhenever Claire would get into a relationship she would pretty much vanish from my life. Then when it went down in flames like it did within a month or two she would start spending a ton of time with me again, saying I was the only person she loved, or could love her. I dismissed this by justifying the fact she was an introvert and only had so much \u2018social energy' and she should spend that fostering a new relationship that made her happy. I also just told myself I was being clingy and shouldn\u2019t be hurt by a  natural part of a friendship. \r\nUsually after increasing my antidepressants, socializing with friends and other self care I can pull myself out of a really bad low. This time I kept getting worse. \r\nAnyways, back to the story. I started to get into a really dark place and became suicidal. After a long time of struggling with it I confided in Claire. She was helpful and I would do okay for a while. Then I'd fall back into a low again and the suicidality would get unbearable again. So I would tell Claire. Throughout our friendship she relied on me heavily with her ED recovery, confide in me whenever she\u2019d relapse(binge and purge), I would talk her through times where she was really low etc. \r\nFinally a couple days after I had been really bad. I stopped replying, totally isolated etc. Claire came over and grilled me about what was going on. I broke down and told her I had decided to kill myself. I couldn\u2019t see an end to this depression and I was tired of fighting it. She convinced me to at least hold on for a little longer. \r\nA few days later Claire texted me saying we needed to take a break on our friendship and if I got into a better place we could try again. She said that every time I got really low and confided in her about it that it caused her to relapse. She told me she couldn\u2019t continue to be my friend if it jeopardized her recovery. I was devastated . On one hand, I couldn\u2019t bear to think me opening up was causing her so much distress.  On the other hand, I was so so hurt that I've lost my best friend because of my stupid actions. \r\nI gave her the space she asked for, and we didn\u2019t talk for several months. When we did it was friendly but superficial. I checked in on her once in a while, saying I wished she was doing well and that I was always available to talk if she was struggling, despite our falling out. \r\nMeanwhile, I pulled out of my depression really quickly after, started feeling good about life. Despite still hurting about the Claire situation. During this time I had some other friends and coworkers who learned about the falling out tell me they didn\u2019t think it was a healthy friendship. Some shared their own experiences of Claire and being hurt by her. Some also told me some she shared some incredibly personal info that I had told her in confidence. I also had coworkers who I trust tell me that after our fall out and prior to her leaving the company she said some very hurtful and untrue things about me that I am still struggling to deal with the fall out of. \r\nCurrently Claire and I haven\u2019t talked in a couple months. We never talked about the things she said. I wrote her a letter saying how hurt I was that she broke my trust but burnt it instead of sending it to try and get closure. I really want to sit down and talk with her but I'm afraid it will start more drama and I don\u2019t think I can handle that. \r\nSorry for the giant wall of text. Maybe I just needed to get that off my chest.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Secondly, I'd love to start a friendship with a Muslim person, as a recent convert and living in a country with one of the lowest amount of followers of Islam in the world - I'm struggling to practise my religion in a proper way and I believe that having someone to talk about faith with, would be very much beneficial.

If the second person is willing to, we could even send each other some packages with traditional snacks/postcards or hand-made things, that sounds exciting.

It doesn't matter what it is, be it love, friendship, or a discord community .\"Sic Parvis Magna\" - Greatness from small beginnings. This discord intends to stay smaller (think: 30-40 people) with an emphasis on building long lasting relationships with people who are not only like-minded, but share an interest in genuinely connecting over time. If you're just passing through, this discord won't be ideal for you. We cannot promise you will meet girls/guys here who you will click with if that's also what you're looking for. Hopefully you're somebody who wants to make real friends, eventually meet up, talk everyday, etc. all that stuff.\n\nThe current members of the discord are from another discord, we know each other very well. What does this mean for you? Well, it means not only do we have this type of experience, but we will also do our best to connect with you. This means if you're a shy type, we don't care. Extrovert? Great, you'll fit right in. Some of us play games, some do not, this is definitely not that type of discord. Since we're talking about creating connections with people, we do expect you to be not only real, honest, but we hope that you are willing to voice as well. Why? Real connections occur when real effort is put out. Text is great, and often times we can only text, but we want to get to know you. Talking over voice is a good way to do this, and I believe that it's the only way to get really close to somebody.\n\nThis discord is very small currently, you will be here at the beginning (and hopefully) for a long time. If you're looking for a very active discord, this is not that currently, though eventually it will be. If you're looking for good friends, chattin shit, banter and finding people long term to talk to, meet, etc, this is for you. Some things about the people in here: We banter, a lot. We make dark jokes, we typically don't view things as sacred bar certain topics, we definitely expect you not to bully people, and we expect you to put actual effort in to creating connections as it's the whole point of this discord. Ideally you are: Genuine, can banter, will not disappear (if we see a lack of effort we will simply remove you.), would like to voice, not an internet personality, etc.\n\nplease PM me if you're interested, thanks.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Honestly i don't know what to write about myself, but please don't think that i'm boring and will be one of those people that responds with a single sentence, i hate that stuff.\n\nSO more about me! I like helping people and i'm fairly emotional but also try to be polite even if i'm bad at it. I am a bit insecure about myself so don't expect me to just jump into voice/video chat right away or anything like that. In fact i kinda prefer being muted in voice chats which means people don't pay attention to me and ignore me so that's nice :') \n\nI play a lot of video games or at least used to, not so much anymore. Recently i've been playing a lot of isaac and CTRNF. i also really like don't starve and tf2. \n\nAs for movies, a few of my favorites are interstellar, grand budapest hotel, shawshank redemption, hmm honestly there's too many to list. I liked the recent breaking bad movie, even tho it was kinda like two more episodes rather than a movie. I like westworld and black mirror. \n\nMy fav anime is BNHA but ik that's kind of a normie choice so don't blast me lmao. I also like welcome to the nhk cuz it's a bit relatable since i don't really go outside much lol. \n\nSo we could watch anything together or play games together if you want! I actually really wanna try the recent thing valve added to steam that lets you play local co-op games online with other people. MAybe we can try that out with games like isaac or gungeon. \n\nI'm from Europe but it doesn't matter if you aren't since my sleep schedule is all kinds of messed up. Rn it's almost midnight and i barely woke up like 3-4 hours ago. Idk something about night-time is peaceful i guess, no need to interact with people and it's way quieter. I also really like when it rains, it's so cozy and comfy. \n\nI can talk about basically anything, you won't weird me out unless you straight up stalk me or something and that actually happened once so i can tell you that story lmao. \n\nI love watching youtube a lot, or twitch streamers. Recently i've been watching vinny play luigi's mansion 3 because i don't own any nintendo consoles . I also really like watching educational videos on youtube like kurzgesagt. I feel like everything i'm listing is super normie and people are silently judging me rn lmao. \n\nMy life is pretty shitty honestly so i understand people who struggle, you can rant to me if you want! I'd love to try to help. I'm very understanding.\n\ni hav  ea dog\n\nI prefer to have like two or three close friends rather than 15 distant friends, so i probably won't physically be able to respond to everyone, but i'll read everybody's messages for sure. So i apologize if i accidentally ghost you, i promise there was no malice behind it.  And to make things easier, please actually know how to talk, don't be dry. It's really annoying when i have to be the one carrying the conversation because the other person doesn't even ask anything or bring up any topics and instead just waits for me to start every conversation. And while i understand that starting convos is hard bc you feel like a burden (trust me i feel the same way) it still feels kinda eh when i'm always the only one starting every conversation.\n\nPlease tell me something about yourself! :) Just say some basic info so that i know more about you, you can write a lot if you want btw, i really like reading walls of texts and i'm not trying to sound sarcastic. \n\nBe around my age please! Other than that, it doesn't matter who you are. So like be in the 17-21 age range.  Hope to hear from you!

It's a super weird story that I barely understand/remember but we met in a south park oc roleplaying (group but not like modern facebook, more like a bunch of fake accounts that are all facebook friends). Anyways we've know each other for ~11 years, been friends for ~9, and I've visited him 3 times (they live about 4 hours away). What I'm worried about is that either they're avoiding having me visit or they're just super unlucky. 2 years ago we had planned a visit that got cancelled because the place they worked closed down, 1 year ago they got fired, and both times I couldn't visit because of financial instability which I totally get, neither of us are rich. I'm trying to make plans to visit them this January between college semesters and I'm worried that they're either gonna get fired for real or that they're just trying to avoid me visiting. Also a thought that just popped into my head is that his girlfriend doesnt like me or thinks I'm a threat??? Which probably isnt true but even if they do think that 1. I'm asexual 2. I'm gay as fuck? Sorry for the rambling but tl:dr: I'm afraid that I wont get to visit them, which sucks bc I always look forward to it as a break from my mostly happily lonely life. And I do feel a little guilty because I've stopped smoking weed and look at the visit as a rare time where I can get super high but mostly I'm afraid they're just not interested in me visiting but cant work up the guts to say it.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

They beg not to tell, of course you don't, and then everything goes right. Even with no classes together, between classes, we exchanged glances and talked. Outside, we would talk and laugh. Nothing could of made me happier than being her friend. We even hung out and watched shows together. She got me into shows, I got her into music. Then after one sleepover, it all changed. Maybe I did something or said something, but it stopped. The texting stopped, there was no laughing, no more late night talks. Then in school, no more talks, or glances, quiet even in a crowd. The worst feeling is when you have to sit back and let your life collapse right in front of you, and watch someone steal them away. Since second grade, she has been taking advantage of her. No one said anything, they let it happen. I couldn't let anything happen, but I was afraid to tell. So, I said to her we needed a break. I thought I did the right thing, but one glance and sad rant had made me realised how much of a jerk I was. I'm ashamed of what I have done, these are the consequences.

Or investing too much?", "author": "OpticNeuron", "self_text": "My best friend from medical school and I have been buddies since 5 years now. I have never thought  twice before dropping my work and going out my way to help him when he needed it. Not because I have to, but because I want to. I can bank on him to do the same.\n\nWe were meeting after 1.5 years. He was a bit stressed as he had some important exams  and was struggling with the prep. I did everything to keep his spirits up and help him out. I had told him before that I was lonely most of our friends had left. When he came back, I occasionally wanted to go out and chill. But never asked him as his studying was more important. It's been 1.5 months since he's back. He has gone out with a bunch of other people and some Tinder dates. But never asked me even once to hangout. I got exasperated one day and stopped talking to him. 2-3 days later I explained to him why was I disappointed. He said I was wrong and childish in expecting this, and being dramatic. He said I could have asked as well. I agree I could have, but felt it was best he focussed on his studying and not distractions like going out and chilling. Meanwhile, I had numerous other problems which I decided to deal with alone, as again, I didn't want to disturb him. \n\nIt hurts me that he didn't even think about calling me to hangout even ONCE in the past month and a half. Like didn't it ever cross his mind that he has a friend here who helped him find a place to stay, get things on track, lent my apartment when he wanted to hookup (lol.)?  After all these years of unconditioned friendship, I feel it was normal of me to expect this basic courtesy from a friend, especially since he was hanging out with other random folks. \n\nEven if I have to move on, I'm so dejected by his behaviour. I would take a bullet for him to even this day. Which makes this harder. Am I expecting to much? Or did I make a mistake somehwhere?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Freshman year I cut off a really toxic friendship I had with L (let\u2019s call her that). Me and L were friends with another girl called K and ever since that it had just been me and K. But then K started hanging out with L, even though she would be really verbally abusive to her and just manipulative. Sophomore year I stopped all contact with K and spent the next 5 months by myself and felt very miserable. It was the first time I ever felt so alone and started getting major anxiety attacks all the time. Somewhere around December is when K reached out to me and explain that she didn\u2019t mean to take L\u2019s side and leave me out - keep in mind that L is the type to forgive people easily - I forgave her because I felt like we could actually try to be friends again.  It was nice to finally have someone to talk to, and I really didn\u2019t want be by myself again. Things between L &amp; K were off and on and I just did not want to be apart of it. Now, junior year, they are still friends. L hangs out with another girl, V, more so often now - she always had a group of people she hung out with while I kind of just sticked with her - and now I feel like the friendship has died out even more now. I\u2019m not what I used to be, I talk less about myself and I\u2019m not very good at expressing my emotions. I used to wait by a hallway for her at lunch but now she just doesn\u2019t show up. Sometimes I feel like maybe I should be more open and tel her how I feel but then I feel like I\u2019m expecting too much out of something that has already died. I don\u2019t know how it even came to this, how does L maintain the friendship with K when she has those tendencies?

She is so brainwashed by him and does everything he says, that if we even dare to confront her about him she snaps back.\n\n\nThis all came to a head about a month ago at our wedding when he got in her face and was screaming at her in the parking lot. This caused a scene and many of the guests witnessed him get very aggressive towards her. Her mom who was also at the wedding, even chased after him with her heel. This was all over her not paying enough attention to him that day. She was my maid of honor.\n\n\n\u00a0After this I couldn't stand it anymore.\u00a0\n\n\nI wrote a message to her saying how hurt I was and how we never received an apology. I also wrote about how my husband and I are sick over how worried we are for her and we have witnessed enough. I let her know that if she ever needs help to contact me but until then we need to end this relationship. She never responded, but instead took to Facebook to post passive aggressive messages about how I am \" jealous\" because she is reaching her \"life goals\" before me (they are both employed part time, make less that $20,000 a year and just bought a house, which she believes I am jealous about somehow).\u00a0\n\n\nThis just completely hurt me to do but I am very worried about her and felt it was my only option, not only for maybe a bit of a wake up call for her, but for my own mental health, as I have been trying to help her for the past 3 year and it has taken a toll.\u00a0\n\n\nI just wonder if what I did was the right thing.\u00a0\n\n\nTL;DWR had to end a 16 year friendship over an abusive boyfriend, wrote a message cutting ties.

I\u2019ve taken this interest into my professional life by becoming a graphic designer, which was all well and good but while I\u2019ve done a lot, the job market has made things difficult.\n\nI also enjoy gaming. Subnautica has got to be one of my favourite games. My gaming interests vary from Skyrim to GTA to Stardew Valley to The Turing Test to Dragon Age to Spyro and plenty more. \n\nOne of the things I want most right now is a house. I\u2019ve always wanted a house and to decorate, care for and love it. Right from a child I would move furniture about my room, carefully choose how to display ornaments and toys and try to improve upon things. I adore shopping and browsing through homeware (homesense is possibly my favourite shop).\n\nWhile I do love cats, I am a dog person. But more importantly, I adore birds and alpacas. I used to own a cockatiel and I currently have two alpacas! I also really like flamingos and highland cows but sadly I don\u2019t own either of those.\n\nThere\u2019s more to me than just this but it\u2019s hard to think of everything in one go. I like mostly rock music. My favourite genre of tv is probably comedy. I am a Christian. I try to improve upon myself as an individual. When I find a close friend I believe myself to be very devoted  to them. I am happily engaged to a wonderful person. And I\u2019m fairly sure ducks are plotting to overthrow humanity.\n\nWe don\u2019t have to share interests to be friends. If you feel like I\u2019m the kind of person you\u2019d like to have as a friend then message me! Maybe tell me some general things about yourself like basic interests and other basics about yourself. Or be wildly specific(!) like any great stories you have about yourself,\n\nAnd lastly- please no flirting/creepiness as I\u2019m not interested. And if I have to keep carrying conversation then I don\u2019t think it will work out between us. But thanks for reading if you got this far!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I have a couple friends that I talk to pretty often which is better then I was where I had nobody for a few years and I'm out looking for people rather then doing nothing. But for some reason that isn't enough for me and I want more attention at all times of the day. I think this is childish and immature to expect that if people and that I just need to let it go and be happy for what I have but this urge is just not going away and I'm not sure how much more tossing it around in my head will do.\n\nNow I think this is somewhat contributed to the fact that I have never been in a relationship with anyone and have been looking a lot more lately but have been unsuccessful. It's not the problem that I'm being rejected though it's just that every girl I ask out is already taken in one way or another. This in itself isn't a problem and I've made a couple of them my friends afterwards but I think it is getting to me after the tenth girl in a row. \n\nWhat do you tnhink of the situation?

We were really happy with each other the first few months but I think the distance got to us somewhere around August. We originally planned on meeting up irl in November, but plans changed and we got to finally meet in August for 5 days. Those days were the happiest days of my life, no contest. We hung out pretty much the entire time. I had my first kiss, and I ended up losing my virginity to him. I felt like those days we spent together made our relationship stronger but it ended up making it worse. We broke up because I didn't want to use a webcam to talk to him when I made it very clear to him how insecure I was about my looks. It was already hard enough showing him everything about me in real life. So he cut it off. This was in the middle of October. Near the end we weren't really perfect. He felt like I didn't give him enough attention (I needed a lot of alone time because I suffered, and still suffer, from depression.) and we were both hot headed. When arguments happened, they were really bad.\n\nWhen we broke up, he said he didn't want to be friends with me. He came back a few days later saying he changed his mind because he said he really cared about me but couldn't sustain a relationship with me, which I get, I guess. I had originally asked to stay friends when we broke up but he said no. I was heartbroken and obviously very upset for a few days. The day he came back I realized I couldn't see his name without bursting into tears, and I said no, not right now. I ended up removing him as a contact from everything I had, for my sanity. I couldn't even handle seeing his name come online on a mutual game we played.\n\nHe got a girlfriend within 3 weeks. This obviously hurt me deeply. It's his right and he can do what he wants, but it very much cut deep into me. I messaged him saying I knew from a mutual friend seeing him talk about it in a discord server that we once shared, but I left because I couldn't stand seeing his messages constantly, since he was really active. I said it was scummy, and asked him how dare he said he cared about me and missed me when he goes around and does that. He didn't take it very well. He said that he was meeting new people as a means to cope. I don't know how valid that is, because that is not at all how I feel about coping when you lose a relationship, and I haven't really put much more thought about it since then.  (To be clear, I know this wasn't entirely within my rights to do, but I did it anyway.) I said I would stop talking to him again, and didn't hold it up very well.\n\nI messaged him a few nights ago, about something important I needed to ask him, unrelated to our relationship. He was extremely drunk at the time. It just spiraled back into us talking about our relationship. I said I didn't leave my bed for days. I said I lost weight and didn't eat for 2 days because I was so depressed. (It was mildly guilt trippy of me to admit these things to him, I admit, but he said he cared about me and wanted to help me in any way he could.) I just felt empty. I needed to talk to somebody about it and I thought he was the one who could help me. I think this caused us both to relapse momentarily. He said he felt horrible about everything he had done. He couldn't stop crying. He eventually got off because he was really intoxicated and said he wasn't in a proper state of mind to talk to me. I immediately felt guilty for even messaging him, and said goodnight.\n\nHe messaged me the next morning with a clear mind and said that I got to him while he was drunk and missed taking care of me. He said that seeing me in so much pain made him hurt and made him feel responsible of taking care of me again. And said we should stop talking for real until we both could do so without getting emotional. That was the last time I talked to him.\n\nI've been in my bed for the majority of the past month. I've probably had Mr. Brightside on loop on maximum volume in my room for 80% of the past week. I feel replaced instantly, when he said he wanted to marry me one day. It hurts so much that he wants to stay my friend, and it hurts so much I can't be with him anymore. It's just a contradictory hell, and no matter what I do everything hurts. My self esteem has gone into the ground, because I felt like if I had confidence in myself and agreed to video call I wouldn't be here.\n\nIt takes all of my willpower to not message him every day, asking for a second chance, when I know he would never agree. Distance got the best of us in the end. It hurts knowing he still cares for me, and I wish he wouldn't so I could hate him and get over it. I hate that he replaced me in a few weeks, and talks about it all the time in a discord server I called my home, but I can't stomach seeing him talk about it. I physically puked upon seeing it for the first time. I blocked him a few times, but I don't have enough control to NOT click the button to show the messages I'm missing. I feel like many people don't have that control either.\n\nI've already been depressed. I don't think I have a future, I take online school so my social interaction in real life is minimal, I hate myself. I don't know how to make friends. I don't know where to go to find another relationship, even though I don't want to. This, on top of everything, has made me borderline suicidal. My life feels so empty without him. He was my best friend alongside being the person I loved the most, and I don't have him anymore. I'm so conflicted.\n\nI just want some wisdom or kind words to help me get over him. I've been miserable for the past few weeks and it's gotten to the point where I lay in bed all day, entering a never ending cycle of numbness and sobbing my eyes out. My passion for everything has just gone away. :(", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I've known her for a very long time and when we were younger (12-14) she used to get offended about literally everything. It was kind of toxic. But then she grew up (we're 19) and it almost completely stopped. But still not completely, sometimes she gets offended by some random shit. She says it's because little things that bother her build up and she lets them all out at once. We went to high school together and started university this year, but different ones, so this is our first year of not spending basically every day together. At high school, she used to not talk to me for a while, then just start acting normal again. I'm terrified of conflict, so I once tried to ask her what was wrong, she didn't text back, and then I just left her alone, assuming she needed space, and afraid of the conflict. Otherwise she's a lovely wonderful adorable girl, and I 99% trust her (99% because I don't trust anyone 100% but I think that's normal) and tell her about almost everything, so does she to me, we still spend a lot of time together and the friendship stopped being toxic a long time ago. But I still have no idea what to do when she gets offended like this. \nSorry for the long back story, so the current situation. We met last Friday, then texted each other only like 3 sentences on Saturday, but that seemed fine. Then I texted her on Sunday and asked something. She replied \"Yeah.\" which sounded offended (I know it sounds weird but believe me, it did sound weird in that situation, it's unnecessary to explain), so I asked if everything was okay. She didn't reply. This was on Sunday, it's now Tuesday. During high school when something like this happened, I at least had an idea of what could be wrong. Now I literally can't think of anything, like I've played through everything I said to her in my mind and I have absolutely no idea. I thought I'd give her space, she might calm down. But I'm not sure what to do now. I was thinking, I could text her tomorrow, only something like \"what's wrong\" if she doesn't text until then. My problem is that not texting her sends her two different messages. One is that she can't play this game with me. That I'm not like her fucked up family, where this is all a game of power dynamics, and she won't make me text her something like \"idk what I did to you but I'm sorry\". She can't do this to me. This is setting boundaries, and it's great. But on the other hand, the other message of me not texting her is that I don't care about her, that I'm fine without her. Which is obviously not true, I miss her. I don't want her to think so. What do you think? What should I do?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

The day before I asked a girl in the other dorm of my complex on campus if she wanted to golf with me. She said she wanted to buy could only do practice session with me. \n\nWe had a great time practicing together and getting to know each other a bit more before my round. We spent a lot of time at the chipping green. I paid for her token at the range and she really appreciated and it was great getting to see where we both were at with our swings. She hadn't played in 4 months and I just started playing golf again in July. \n\nShe was quite impressed with my swing sand I was honestly quite the same with her considering how long it's been for her. I have the Taylormade M4 Driver and Fairway Wood, which have a really nice carbon sound (carbon Composite clubheads). She noticed and said she really liked the sound. She's more into Ping and Callaway, I'm a Taylormade golfer. I'm going to be upgrading my entire set to Taylormade M6. \n\nAfter the practice session, we exchanged numbers and I headed off to my first tee. The guy behind my group recognized us and asked if she was my wife \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. She and I only really formally met like a month ago and this was our first time hanging out together. She stays in the same complex but I'm the adjacent building, and only came to my dorm building once. \n\nI think she and I do have a high potential for a strong close friendship together because we seen to get along very well. We do plan on actually playing a round together next week or so. She's very nice and sweet and I really look forward to creating some kind of strong friendship also outside of just golfing. \n\nMy round of the day though, I absolutely crushed my record, it's insane. After the front 9, which I got par on 4 of the holes, the back 9 I got a 4-streak of consecutive pars from 10-13. My longest recorded drive was around 300-310 yards (my average driving distance is 280 yards; for most weekend golfers, it's typically between 200-250; PGA Tour lower average is from around 280 yards).", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I understand that in today's world it can be hard to put energy in to develop a tight relationship with someone, especially if you don't know them in real life. Most of my true irl friends have moved on from putting in effort into our friendship at this point. I cannot say I blame them as most of them are new parents, have heavy workloads, are newly married, or have moved far away. It probably also doesn't help that I hate texting and prefer an actual voice conversation. I am finding that I am bored and have a lot of free time to develop a good friendship with someone. \n\nSo,  about me... Let's see,  I am from California but,  no longer live there and have bought a home in another state.  I miss my home state but, I do get to visit. I have 3 Boxer dogs who I spend most of my time with,  so expect to get bombarded with cute photos of them from time to time. I smoke marijuana and have for about 8 years. I have medical issues that it really,  really helps with. I'd like a friend who understands that, even if they choose not to medicate with it (most of my irl friends do not smoke but, are non-judgmental). I am extremely into art.  I paint, draw, and have even tattooed. I also really like music, I love all genres.  I listen to a lot of psychedelic rock and reggae as of late. I love going to concerts. I also like gaming in my free time and have MANY different systems. My favorite game that I have platinumed is Bloodborne.  I also really love make-up,  fashion,  reading,  watching movies. I have a huge interest in marine biology,  ethnobotany, and archeology. \nThere's so much I could go into but,  I am really not very self gloryfing and would like someone who is equally interested in sharing their self passions,  even if they are totally different from mine. \n\nMy preferred way to communicate is through discord, so if you are willing to become friends please hit me up and ask for my contact information. \n\nHope you have a good day!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Sadly I don't have a dog or any pet but, would love one in the future. \n\nI'm a big WWE fan or at least try to watch what I can. Been watching since 2006.

It could be from a bad tooth I have, the fact that I have been putting q tips and my fingers in my ears to clean out wax, or my sinuses being terrible like they have been for the last year.\n\nWhen this pressure started about 3 weeks ago, it just started with some intense nausea and vertigo. It went away after a few days, then turned into the pressure in my head. I am thinking that this is most likely a sinus or ear thing, but I am honestly unsure. I just finished a round of antibiotics that tortured my stomach for literally 5 days straight, but they did not seem to solve the problem. I had one very good morning a couple days into the course of them, but then I got worse again. I am scared that it is going to kill me, but I am probably just being irrational.\n\nThe other thing that I am terrified about is sleep. I have been having serious sleep anxiety because I went through cold turkey ativan about 15ish months ago. It was seriously the worst thing that I have ever done. I got about 1-2 hours of sleep per night every night, then stayed awake for 5 days straight and had a seizure at the end of it. The same or next day (I honestly cannot remember), I ended up sleeping just fine. Cut to 6 months ago when my parents get a new puppy that barks endlessly and wakes me up during the day because my sleep schedule is shit. My parents just tell me to go to sleep when they do, but I have anxiety that I will not be able to get to sleep in time, so I end up not sleeping.\n\nWhat I need very badly is to talk to someone, either over discord or the phone. I very badly need someone here who will talk me through these panic attacks and maybe chill with me while I try to sleep. Someone around my age would be best (I just turned 32). I understand that this is a big ask, and I apologize for asking for something so big, but I really need someone badly.

I guess I'm looking for internet friends. I sometimes have a hard time keeping conversations going, especially if I'm feeling particularly sad or tired, but I enjoy making new friends. I'm not looking for any particular age group, although I tend to find myself relating more to people with mature, yet highly sarcastic, personalities. (If you\u2019re 20+ no WEIRD SHIT, I\u2019m tired of grown men making sexual innuendos)\n\nHere's some things about myself:- I love fashion, especially streetwear. I think it's the best way to express myself to people and I really enjoy piecing together outfits. I'm adopted from Korea, I now reside in the US. I enjoy reading YA books, most recently I read \"The Hate U Give\" by Angie Thomas. I typically side with more liberal politics and ideas. I'm very much into social justice and activism, and I love to learn more about these topics. I'm always open to learning new things and listening. I love video games, although I mainly play Dead by Daylight on PS4. I love horror movies and the thrill of being scared. I love being active, especially going to the gym and doing dance. I partake in hip hop, lyrical, pointe, and jazz dance. I love music, especially lofi, rap, indie and some pop. But don't think I won't thrash around to some punk music. Kacey Musgraves is the only country artist I enjoy, so don't even bring it up lmao.\n\nI'm a bit emotional and I keep to myself a lot, but I've recently been feeling lonely after moving and my friends getting daily jobs. I use Discord, but you can always PM me on Reddit. I also use other forms of social media, so just ask if you want it.\n\nIf you think you're interested, just send me a message, I swear I don't bite lol.\n\nEDIT: I'm sorry for the typos, my mind went faster than my fingers.

I'm 21 and from the UK. To be honest, over the years most of my friends have moved on with their lives, met new people, that sort of stuff. Unfortunately, for various reasons, the same hasn't happened with me. At this point in my life I'm really keen to try and reach out and make some friends of my own - people who I can have a great time talking to.\n\nI'm really into gaming on the PC - I own a few multiplayer games, like Gmod, Terraria, Minecraft, Pit People. I'm a fan of a lot of lesser known games, but I'll play anything as long as its good fun. I don't play anything competitively, because I'm a scrub, and I'm not really bothered by competition.\n\nI'm into super ironic memes (yikes), I'd say my sense of humour comprises of irony, satire, abstract stuff. My favourite shows are The Eric Andre Show and probably something like Avatar. Not really into anime, although JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is an exception to this. I watch a lot, read a lot, am into politics and history, as well as religion, and enjoy talking about those topics, but I'm not toxic. I don't force my opinion down people's throats, I'm just interested in what other people believe in. I like having long talks about nearly anything under the sun.\n\nWhat am I looking for? If you want to play games together, share weird and obscure (and truly weird) memes, or just to chat - that's pretty much what I'd be looking for. I'm from the UK so obviously be practical about time differences. If you do decide you want to talk, just drop me a message. Please don't take it personally if my replies come across as short, uninterested or boring - I really struggle with getting to know new people. Once we become comfortable, I'll be fine. Please don't take it to mean I don't want to talk.\n\nNow that's out of the way, if you're still here and interested, drop me a message! I look forward to saying hi to anyone that pops up.

Whether that is depression, social anxiety, insecurities, or just loneliness. Whatever the reason, as much as we really want a friend, we may fear that change. That feeling of requirement and effort needed for a friendship. More accurately, in real life we can\u2019t choose those who surround us. We all have or know that story of someone we initially didn\u2019t like, but through learning why they act a certain way or just being around them they chip away. Suddenly some random day you find yourself liking them, or at the least admiring them.\n\nThis is the internet and we have the wonderful privilege of being extremely picky, picky enough that this subreddit is filled with posts and yet many come back. Whether through ghosting or lack of response finding someone seems exceedingly rare. Honestly that\u2019s completely understandable, who would logically continue a conversation with some stranger you\u2019ve never met, who you most likely will never meet. Especially if you don\u2019t like them and don\u2019t feel like investing.\n\nI\u2019ve done this to my own admittance. I\u2019m sure there are some lovely people out there that didn\u2019t get a response. I\u2019ve been on both sides of that. It is what it is.\n\nThe game is simple, you dm me what you want. I promise to be as open minded as possible.\n\nWe can rant to each other about our problems and give some hypocritical advice neither of us want to hear.\n\nCommunicate through emoji\u2019s and reddit links \n\nShare an endless supply of pet pictures\n\nPromise to motivate each other daily, whether for work or going to the gym. \n\n\nWhatever you want, I rather be straight forward in each other\u2019s expectations than act as if there are none. You are looking for something specific otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be scrolling so much. \n\nFriendships are a wonderful privilege, not an entitlement. If you feel at any point you don\u2019t want to talk, or continue to talk I have no problem with that. You and your happiness are far more important than a desire for a friend. \n\nThank you so much for reading.

Since then and even before then our communication has been far less than it was and they don't seem all that interested when we do talk.\n\nI know it's common in new relationships to have an obsession phase, but it just sucks that my friend is entering this new phase of their life and doesn't seem at all interested in telling me about this new person.

She went out of her way to ruin my reputation (long story but basically she made up rumours and it ended everything and I didn\u2019t find any interest in wanting to rekindle the friendship). Basically the remaining friends that are in the group are kind of stuck in the cross fire of the fight between her and I. The group hangs out with her a lot (22F) and I kind of never show up when I know she\u2019s around. We never shared the fight that happened between us because it was just too much. She still runs her mouth about me when I\u2019m not in the group. The group would tell me that she\u2019s doing so. This girl would also go out of her way to make a fake Instagram account to send me hate which is very strange, maybe she\u2019s just got a lot of time on her hands. I\u2019ve never addressed her personally because I don\u2019t find the need to and she\u2019s the type of person who avoid confrontation because she will literally say it\u2019s a hate crime (she\u2019s a women of colour, honestly fighting words in my opinion). \n\nI\u2019ve slowly drifted away from the group, but what motivated me to write this post was because one of the friends recently messaged me asking to chill. I kind of read it and didn\u2019t respond, I know, childish sorry.

How do I know if they\u2019re a group talking about me when I\u2019m not around because my opinion is that if there\u2019s shit talking, people will eventually join... and I don\u2019t know if the speak up to correct her or tell her to stop (because they\u2019re all scared of her or feel hostile around her, the main reason why I was even in the group was because I kind of stood up to her because she was a bully and plus she made things super hostile but these friends don\u2019t really see the hostility or drama that\u2019s created).

Everytime we hang out as three, we have fun , I have good connection with the others in the group too,I hang out with them, I am funny and they laugh at my jokes   well. I like this group. soo I wanted to be with them more and more but the problem was that  I was never invited I would always stand at the hallway to ask them where they are going and then they ask me to come along. Went up to their classrooms, always nice and smiley, asking the one I am close with they are going to finish school. I am the one asking, she never asks me. I like her a lot and I am clingy to her and she is taking advantage of it because she changes mood. I always write to her when she feels sad. But over the summer, they hang a lot and I was never invited to anything and always found out things through another freind that was invited by her freind in the group. \nlately I stopped trying soo hard and nope I was not invited to anything for three months. Then second thing is that 2 weeks ago it was one the girl I was almost close with birthday and I didn't bought her present because I was busy and forget but I have never  got any presents from any of them although I bought them when we go out on their birthdays. Now I also feel bad about the gift thing. I just feel horrible because last year was great and I had fun but this year back to old me again. But luckily I have another group I hang out with, but I can't do much with them since they don't have money all the time. they treat me better.

I always wait till midnight to congrats them. \nSo I decided to talk with the one I was close with but her excuse is that, if she is not organazing things she can't invite me. But she never organaze stffs in the group so I will wait for the invite then.

My younger friend is 16, and my older one is 20, so please let\u2019s not go too much under/over that. I\u2019m set on the GMT+0 as for time zones.\nHope someone who likes said things find this, otherwise I guess I\u2019ll repost it later. Ciao my dudes !", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Ive never been invited to a birthday party, an out-of-school or in school event, and have never had a confidant. I\u2019m not the typical loner type and am not particularly socially awkward or inhibited. I guess the essence of it boils down to always feeling out of place amongst my peers. To provide contextual setting, I live in SoCal.\n\nIt\u2019s not for lack of opportunities or effort on my part either. I\u2019ve played competitive football and hockey my entire life and was constantly exposed to the large crowds and everything that accompanied that kind of life. I\u2019ve been describe as handsome and have been pretty muscular my entire life. Ever since elementary, I\u2019ve been hit on by both girls and guys. I wouldn\u2019t describe myself as particularly shy either but perhaps a little reserved. I make a conscious effort to care for my physical appearance as well as attempt to appear confident in other areas of my life. \n\nBut for some reason, I never quite found my niche. I never got along with any of my teammates, I\u2019d always feel out of place whenever I was placed into higher level classes, and would never quite be able to successfully maintain a \u201cfriendship\u201d for more than a week. Even as a kid, I would never get along with my parents either. I\u2019m pretty certain I\u2019m not on the autistic spectrum either as I\u2019m not oblivious to social cues, am especially rigid, or have trouble maintain banter. But people have just never wanted to be around me.\n\nI\u2019ve attempted to compromise on certain aspects of myself in an attempt to fit in. I\u2019ve tried integrating into various social groups like the athletes, the intellectuals, the nerdy and geeky kids, etc. . But every time, I would feel like I\u2019m betraying myself and immediately withdraw myself from that scene. \n\nAnd even though I\u2019ve found myself in these circumstances, I\u2019ve managed to become a stronger person overall. In certain respects, it\u2019s great being your own best friend as you are your own authority. You answer only to yourself and do whatever you want without taking someone else\u2019s existence into account. You become self-sufficient and evidently, incredibly independent. However, there are occasional instances of profound loneliness and solitude. You become sensitive in the sense of observation in regard to identifying in others what you do not have. Everyday, I see people in both strong platonic and romantic relationships, and you think to yourself why not me? Why can\u2019t I laugh and confide my deepest thoughts in another without fear of word spreading. Why can\u2019t I be embraced, loved, and accepted by another? Why not me I think?\n\nBut these thoughts are but brief and far inbetween. Truth is, I\u2019ve been mostly desensitized to it. When being on your own has been all that you know for all your life, it becomes the norm. For most of my life, I\u2019ve accepted these circumstances and am grateful for how they\u2019ve made me become a stronger person. But truthfully at the present moment, I don\u2019t like who\u2019ve I\u2019ve become because of it. I lack serious empathy and view those who require the companionship of someone else weak and childish. I see what everyone else has to offer me in regards to friendship or romantic relationships as inferior to my own self-companionship.

The friends I did have from high school are now doing their own thing so I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve just drifted apart.

Basically, I had two friends in my life: a childhood best friend (let's call her Jane), and best friend which Jade introduced me to (\"Leah\"). Leah gave me a bad first impression, because she was very pessimistic, got all huffy pretty easily (she mostly argues with Jade), etc. But she showed her good side when she started to be more comfortable around me. I found out that Leah is generous, genuine girl, that has a tough life, depression, friends that silently ghosted her and several attemts to commit suicide in the past. I still was aware of her negativity, but tried to make her smile (e.g. I traveled to her hometown to celebrate her bday when she couldn't celebrate it in city where we and Jade live). Jade liked her as well, and together we formed trio, where I was sorta playing role of pacifier between two hot-tempered girls. And at first we had a great time.\n\nBut then Jade showed dark side of her personality - basically she was acting cold and bitchy to me and Lesh for no reason for one day. We started to distrust Jade. We decided that we will give her second chance, and I just made Jade just an acqauintance in my mind, and Leah tried to make their friendship work out, while arguing with her all the time (mostly about trivial things, that don't even matter and rather not conflicting if you let other person have their opinion about this or that).\n\nAnd then their friendship fell apart. Jade said that she can't be her punching bag anymore. Leah said she can't trust her. So our trio fell apart and there is just the two of us now. And it's quite...nerve-wracking. I never felt that when we were a trio, but I always feel myself guilty loser, and this feeling connected mostly with Leah. I am scatterbrained and I tend to confuse streets, forget to call someone, stand like an idiot when I have task I don't understand instead of just asking what should I do, etc. So I pretty often see 15 missed calls from Leah when I'm not answer her because I'm in gym, or think \"Omg, Leah is going to be so angry at me\" and spoil my own mood...even if she's not angry at me at the end of a day. Yesterday I cried like a little girl because I couldn't print Hogwart's artworks I made for her project in uni. She told me to calm down but it didn't help. Every time I meet her I think that I will make something dumb and disappoint her, and I can't take it. I know that she has a tough life,\u00a0 can be quite emotional and still remembers times when friends left her., and I don't want to ghost her like that .But I also remember times when I was trying to hide my clumsy nature from father because he would make fun of me, so this is kinda sensitive topic to me. Leah and father are the only two people that ever made me think about this that much, and I don't know if they point out thing that needs ti be adressed and I just jump into negative self-talk which makes me feel nervous around them or they talk about my scatterbrain in negative and hurtful way which makes me so stressed?\n\nAm I a sensitive asshole that can't take criticism about my character traits? Is Leah has negative impact on me or shows me way to improve myself? And the main question is: how to resolve my inner conflict until I break down and argue with Leah? \nP.S.: grammar. English is not my native language and I'm trying my best so please be understanding", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

She told me he was texting her and asked me if he had a girlfriend, I said \u201cyes, I even know both of them in person\u201d. At the beginning her reaction seemed to me like she was not feeling comfortable with his behavior. She even told me \u201cwhat he is doing is not nice I would not like it if I was her girlfriend. A month later, she told me that (this same guy) of all men she was talking to was the nicest and told me he was going to invite her to a date. I was a bit shocked. I said \u201cbut he has a girlfriend\u201d, of course in a sad mood; she replied \u201cbut what if they are having problems, there is nothing bad about this\u201d... I was a bit interested in her then but this... it started a chain of thoughts about her that something was not right. This happened during a concert and after my response to her comment she didn\u2019t talk to me the rest of the night she even asked me out loud if I wanted her to return me the money of the invitation. Of course I never, ever invited her anywhere again.\n\nShe still kept texting and calling me but then she was only talking to me to complain about everything. Against her parents, friends, work, well... everything. A few months after what happened in the concert I noticed her photos being liked and loved by this same guy and she doing the same to him. I was almost sure they were having an affair (at least theough chat), but she kept texting me almost everyday. While she talked to me only to complain on her parents and friends her Facebook page was something completely different. She seemed to adore her parents, saying her mother was the best, the same with her father, sister, cousins, etc it was getting really annoying to me and it soon made me wonder if she was a fake, bad woman. She also boasted everytime of her career as an attorney. When talking to me about her interests she said she despised this certain music genre, but then I saw some Instagram images and photos of her even singing in a concert of a singer of that genre she \u201chated\u201d. \n\nIf I answered something she would take hours to reply and, for some strange reason she seldom liked or loved any of my photos. The time came that she finally stopped texting me everyday and right now, our communication is approaching a its end as now it can take weeks or months to know about each other. And it is 100% time she starting the communication. I haven\u2019t said anything to her (starting a conversation on my part) since summer.\n\nI don\u2019t want to talk to her anymore, she is not a sincere person, looks like someone who likes to use people, and I even feel nauseated having been attracted to her. She is very good looking but it seems in everything else she is a disaster.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Also this is going to be pretty long, but any advice is appreciated :)\n\nSo I decided to go study abroad last year and it was the scariest thing I\u2019ve ever done. I was moving to a different country with a different language, so naturally one of my fears was: will I be able to make friends? It usually takes me a while to find friends because I\u2019m kind of socially anxious but nevertheless I always find at least one person I click with. Anyway to make a long story short, currently I have two friends I see regularly in classes and this other group of \u201cfriends\u201d that was put together by this one girl that was my friend but decided to leave the university. She was really social and would meet people from our program and other programs and add them to this group, but it was kind of awkward because those people would already have their own friends they hang out with so it felt more like a group of classmates than friends if you know what I mean. So from the two people I see more often, I am closer to one. Let\u2019s call her Sarah. So Sarah and I met maybe one month after university started and we actually had a lot in common and hit it off. We gradually became a lot closer and shared deeper conversations. So recently I feel like she\u2019s been more distant and when I\u2019m with her I feel like I\u2019m boring her? \nSo here are some of the things I noticed: \n1. I\u2019m always the one to text first or suggested we go out somewhere. She would accept the invites but at some point I just stopped asking because I figured I was just bothering her, I guess, if it\u2019s always me who\u2019s asking. It\u2019s been a month since we came back from school break and we only hung out once outside of class, when I had to remind her it was my birthday. \n2. When we are together she\u2019s glued to her phone. Sometimes I would be talking and she wouldn\u2019t be listening or even hear me so basically I\u2019m talking to a wall.\n3. About the birthday thing, usually the group I mentioned earlier would prepare a card and everyone would write something nice in it. I have always participated in that. I received nothing. Sarah got me a gift like three days after my birthday (which I still appreciate) but I feel like she didn\u2019t put any effort into it because she just gave to me and it wasn\u2019t wrapped or anything. When it was her birthday I gave her my own personal card and wrapped her gift really nice to show her I how much I care. It\u2019s a small issue but it still stung.\n \nOn weekends I\u2019m really lonely because I wish I had someone to hang out with but everyone has their own life and I feel like Sarah is just bored with me and missing her friends back home. I\u2019ve even resorted to online friend apps like Bumble BFF but nothing came out of it. So I guess I\u2019m just stuck and I don\u2019t really know what to do. Any advice is appreciated, or even share if you feel the same - it would be nice to know I\u2019m not alone.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Gonna give you guys a neat and hopefully satisfying description to read :) lol have fun (probably I\u2019ll have to make a TLDR in the end bc this post is going to be a whole essay. Appreciate it if your read it all to the end though)\n\n**Basics**\nI\u2019m Rose, 15 years old, 16 in January. Born and raised in the Netherlands. Now in my 2 last years on high school, and already preparing to go to art school after I get my diploma.\nFor the people who care: I am INTJ, Aquarius, left handed, 1,68m (5\u20196\u201d), I have blue eyes and currently dyed brown hair but that\u2019s gonna change soon. Hopefully gonna get pastel pink. I would be bi bc I I believe I fall in love with a person bc of their character and partly looks lol. Not necessarily with a gender. Though I seem to get along better with guys. Don\u2019t know yet, never been in love. \n\n**Interests**\nArts is my thing, my passion, my everything. I know it sounds cheesy but idk I just love it. I enjoy going to modern art museums, taking long walks through the city, going to concerts (doing that rarely but still love it), making art myself, travel, photography, watching movies and series (I\u2019ll come back to that cuz I\u2019m such a movie fanatic), listening to music, and more but I don\u2019t remember atm. \n\n**fav movies + music**\nOh I love movies. I\u2019m keeping a watchlist since 2016 and it\u2019s growing and growing. Tell me if you know a cool movie I should see. I\u2019d love to hear it! My taste is wide I guess. I love Quentin Tarantino, Steven Spielberg, Christopher Nolan, Stanley Kubrick, and more. But recently I have been watching individual indie movies like Lady Bird and Call Me By Your Name (Loved both movies so much). \n\nI would say I have a varied music taste. But I\u2019m mostly into 70s/80s/90s. To name some artists: Radiohead, Joy Division, The Cure, Bjork, Nirvana, Jeff Buckley, The Beatles, Beastie Boys, The Doors, Miles Davis, Nothing But Thieves, Oasis, Palace, The Smiths, Thom Yorke, Tash Sultana, The Velvet Underground, etc. (I also listen to classical piano music mostly from movies or just pianists but those are playlists with random famous classical piano songs). Again I\u2019m recently mostly listening to indie songs of more unknown artists bc I\u2019m in the mood for it. \n\n**Okay enough about me, let\u2019s talk about you**\nI hope you\u2019re more of an extrovert who always has something to say to keep our conversation going. Always be honest with me bc I will be too :\u2019)\nMost of you guys like anime, memes, games, pets, etc. I\u2019m that unpopular weirdo who doesn\u2019t. But I\u2019m okay with it if you like it. That\u2019s no problem. I would appreciate it if you are open minded and also into having a long term friendship. I think that\u2019s all.\n\n**THANK YOU** if you read everything until here. You\u2019re an amazing human and I would love to get you know you. Shoot me a message if you\u2019re interested. I have Discord, Instagram, ofc Reddit, email if you wanna penpal, maybe ever exchanging phone numbers but likely not lol\n\n**TLDR**\nHi I\u2019m Rose, 15years old, almost 16. From the Netherlands. Into arts, movies and music. Down for a long term friendship and fun conversations.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I ended up going to the concert but she quite obviously saw me but she didn't even say hello to me and left me sat there awkwardly. she didn't even thank me for going to see her. and she hasn't spoken to me for the rest of the day either. she does this kind of thing quite often which is kinda annoying.\nthis has happened loads over the past year and its really getting on my nerves. when I am friends with her she's a great person but she can be really difficult to be friends with sometimes. it can feel like she's just taking and I never really get anything back. as it is I wonder If I am being too nice by consistently being there for whenever she wants to come back. I feel like I tolerate a lot from her whereas she has very little patience for me.\ntbh I just want to understand what's going on with her and I wanna know what I can do to solve it. is this just a girl thing that I don't understand? or do you think that egnoring people is her way of dealing with problems?

I\u2019ll leave out some minor details to try and shorten it down. \n\nI\u2019ve always been kind of shy when first meeting people because I\u2019m not sure what kind of person they are (I sometimes change my way of talking or speak more causal depending on the person) and that\u2019s never really stopped me from making friends. I\u2019ve never been super popular but I\u2019ve been able to find a group of people to hang out with while growing up. \n\nOne of these friends from high school, I\u2019ll call her Erin, ended up going to the same college as me and we just did our own thing for a semester but hung out more once second semester started. During first semester, I became friends with my roommate, let\u2019s call her Tiffany, and a boy who lived In our same building, we\u2019ll call him jin. By the time second semester came around, Erin was becoming friends with my roommate and Jin which I was really happy about because we all got along and had a good time. \n\nHowever, this is my third semester and somehow all my friends (Jin and Tiffany added a lot of friends to our group) have come to detest me. Erin and Tiffany started studying together and at first they invited me but I sometimes declined if I was being lazy or felt like studying alone. Eventually they stopped inviting me and became close with each other. From there, since we weren\u2019t hanging out we just stoped talking (if I walked through the room they would ignore me and they would whisper about plans so I wouldn\u2019t hear.) I was super confused because all I did was say I didn\u2019t want to study together a few times. \n\nTurns out, as soon as we stopped talking Erin started gossiping about me behind my back (calling me lazy, ignorant, racist, sensitive, etc...) so I haven\u2019t really felt like mending our relationship. The thing is, she has taken all of my friends from me and kind of turned everyone against me. I know that if I bring my feelings and side of the story up to everyone they will just make me out to be the bad guy and gang up against me. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how to go about this situation. I don\u2019t trust Erin anymore but I\u2019m roommates with Tiffany and I have no other friends outside of our main group (like 10 people) there\u2019s a lot more I could say about my situation but I\u2019ll leave it at that and hope someone has advice for me.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I do not recall how we started talking to each other, everything came naturally and spontaneously despite the Difference in cultures and environment.  \n I called it a healthy friendship because first there wasn't any hard efforts applied from any sides, when I text her for example, I do not expect her to respond today or tomorrow or the next week. I knew that when she has free time, she will reply to my messages.\nThe other reason was about the conversation, we talked about everything from cooking to cultures to hobbies, but most of the time we talked about self growth, business, personal development. For me this is the most valuable and exciting part of this friendship, beside having fun we also learned from each other.\nNow that we don't talk to each other anymore, I'm really looking for a similar experience, so if you wanna have a friend for the long run.

Coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray. \n\nWhisk 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Using a pastry blender or your fingertips, cut or rub butter into the dry ingredients. Stir in salmon.\n\nWhisk milk (or buttermilk) and banana in a medium bowl; stir into the dry ingredients until just combined.\n\nSprinkle a work surface with 1 tablespoon flour. Turn the dough out and sprinkle the top with the remaining 1 tablespoon flour. Knead three to five times, or until the dough just comes together. Divide in half and pat each piece into a 5-inch circle. Cut each circle into 6 wedges and transfer to the prepared baking sheet.\n\nBake the scones until firm to the touch, 18 to 24 minutes.\n\nServe warm with ranch dressing for dipping.

There were many expectations of each other and our views continued to diverse. I was constantly left out on group chats, real-life hangouts or events, and wasn't treated how I was treating them. I would constantly be ignored during our chats and most times in real life. I felt used to buy things here and there for them. They would post on social media hanging together with a few afters I told them I was depressed. I admit I was jealous of seeing them with new friends because whenever I asked to hang out they would continue to ignore. I needed help and hoped they were there for me as they've mentioned before. I never related to anyone because all they spoke about were kpop. I didn't fit it. It might have not seemed like a big deal but I felt good not associating with these people, but I also don't want to see them or any reminiscences from them. I've wanted to block these people and don't want to hear from them ever again. \n\nI've tried to pick up other hobbies in order to move on, but constantly have dreams of them treating me this way. Every time I think about it, it makes me cry. I've recently had surgery and have been restricted to go anywhere, but my thoughts have skyrocketed. I need help and advice on how to deal, get over, and move on. I've tried to unfollow and not associate with them but their posts still pop up through mutual related friends. Should I block them?  Should I delete all social media? Sigh...\n\nThank you for reading this dreadful and full of grammatical errors post. Thank you.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

My interests are pretty standard - videogames, anime (though I rarely watch any nowadays), movies (mostly horror but not exclusively), and I've been getting back into wrestling recently thanks to AEW. Some other minor stuff as well, but those are the primary ones. As far as music goes I mostly listen to power metal and adjacent genres, though I do enjoy some other things at least from time to time. Mental health is something I've had problems with for a long time, so if you have any issues of that nature I can probably relate and maybe help a bit as well. Probably worth mentioning I'm pretty far left ideologically. Gender and age aren't a concern to me, though obviously a big age gap might be a bit uncomfortable.

It's 5PM, I have nothing to do, no one to talk to, can't go outside cause it's storming and I'm not ready to die yet, and I'm just so absolutely bored that I started packing for the trip I'm going on in 3 weeks. Like, I'm pretty sure that's just a tiny bit too early to do that. but I am. so bored.\n\nSo here I am, once again. Not that posting on this sub has worked the other times but don't stop believing I guess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo,about me. Let's see.\n\nI'm 22 years old, currently not studying nor working, but I'm planning to start attending university next year. The idea would be to study English (cause I already kind of know it anyway) and Japanese (cause I'm a big weeb) but also cause apparently learning languages is the one thing I'm the good at.\n\nI'd say that the things I'm the most passionate about are anime and videogames (like pretty much everyone else on this website) but I like other things, like photography and musical theater and singing. I'm not an expert at any of them but I still enjoy them nonetheless.\n\nMusic-wise I tend to listen mostly to old school rock, but I'd sing along to literally anything given the chance. My favourite type of songs at the moment are those cheesy rock ballad from the '80s about believing in yourself and live your life to the fullest- both things I'm not good at, but I try, I swear. That said, if you catch me on Spotify these days, I'm most definitely listening to Queen's whole discography on repeat.\n\nI'm currently going through my yearly obsession with Thomas Sanders- great guy, if you don't know him then you should check him out.\n\nI like birds, a lot. I don't have one, but I wish I did. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that's about it. Please refrain from sending me one-liners cause I'm not going to answer them. I'm really not up for the \"hey\" \"hi\" \"how r u doin\" \"good u\" \"me 2\" kind of conversation. I'm good with lighter and deeper conversations, and usually switch between the two if I have something on my mind or just happen to wonder what the meaning of life is or something. I'd prefer to talk to people around my age simply cause I find it easier to talk to them then way older or younger people. Nothing more to add really.

I have bad social skills but I'm trying to improve.\n\nI'm Asian, just turned 14. I can speak and write English pretty well.\n\nI don't really have a hobby but I do enjoy listening to music, watching movies, and reading novels (My laptop is too weak for video games :(  ). What music I listen to really depends on my mood but some songs I like are Smile (Jimmy Durante), Hurt (Johny Cash), That's Life (Frank Sinatra), Different World (Alan Walker), and Wake me Up (Avicii). Again, the movies I watch also depends on my mood. If I'm feeling down or bored, I'd enjoy the simple, dumb fun blockbusters like Godzilla: KOTM, Transformers, Avengers, Harry Potter... though most of the time, I like movies with underlying messages, meanings or just a complex plot that I could think about like The Dark Knight, Joker, Shin Godzilla, Get Out,... I generally don't like horror movies especially supernatural ones but I do like Alien. TV shows I like are GoT (s1-4)  and Lucifer. As for Novels, I've read half of the Harry Potter books (and then decided to watch the movies), I've read all of the published main series ASOIAF books (Yeah, I'm probably not old enough but the books are just so good), and I'm a third of the way through The Fellowship of the Ring. \n\nI don't have any particular favorite YouTuber but I do enjoy film critic and analysis channel, animal and nature related channels and medical channels, especially Doctor Mike. I occasionally watch gaming channels focusing on Monster Hunter.\n\nIn my free time, I like to think about life, mumble to myself in order to practice English, listen to music, sing (badly), play the guitar, eat snacks, nap, think about things I should be doing instead, draw (badly).\n\nThings I'd like to take up or do: Walking outside, learning philosophy, donate to environmental and/or animal protection charity, reading Fire &amp; Blood and TWOIAF (the bookstores in my area don't seem to have them though :( ), reading TWOW and ADOS (Come on, George! Release the books...)\n\nBad habits: Procrastinating, biting the skin on my fingers (the skin, not fingernails), occasional melancholy, anxiety, difficulty with starting a conversation, avoiding communication, trying too hard to not offend people. \n\nMy current state: At home, preparing to study abroad in Australia next year.\n\nMisc. : I'm interested in animals and the protection and preservation of the environment and endangered species though I can't really do much about that right now aside from raising awareness. I like to watch nature documentaries on Discovery and Animal Planet (Not as much as I used to since Discovery and Animal Planet had declined greatly in quality IMO). My favorite animals are dolphins because of how intelligent and generally interesting they are.\n\nI just want open-minded people around my age (\\~12-16) to chat with. I just want a friend who I could chat with, discuss interests, bitch about things, be blunt, exchange advice (whether good or bad), and share interesting things. Just generally get things off your chest.\n\nIf you want to talk, DM me :)", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I play: Overwatch, Paladins, Minecraft, Skyrim, Fortnite, Alicia Online, The Isle, Kurtzpel, Wolf Quest 2, and Ark Survival. I love all these games and I really hope that some of you play them as well so maybe we can hang out and play together! \n\nOn Overwatch I main Mercy, Dva, Sombra, and Widowmaker\n\nPaladins I main Ying, Seris, and Lian\n\nThe Isle I usually play as a Carno or Rex..

Honestly it\u2019s not something I\u2019m used to, so I\u2019m a bit nervous.", "author": "Harribyte", "self_text": "Hey guys, I just made this Reddit account. My name is Harris, and to be frank, I\u2019m really not used to making friends online. I\u2019ve always been more of an \u201cin-person\u201d kind of guy, but honestly, I\u2019d like to make friends online! I hear from many others that they met their best friends online, and I guess I\u2019d be hoping for something similar. \n\nFor starters, I\u2019m someone that\u2019s come to learn not to take kind people and things for granted, because there wasn\u2019t much of either where I\u2019ve been for the past few months, to say the least. It\u2019s been almost a month since then, so I\u2019d say I\u2019m well adjusted to being more relaxed now.\n\nBut anyway, I figure why not introduce myself more in depth? I\u2019m 21, and I\u2019m an optimist so I try to laugh and smile a lot. I\u2019m a self proclaimed idiot, but in all honesty I\u2019m just a guy that wants to try and be a positive experience for others, even if it entails acting like a fool to brighten someone\u2019s day.\n\nMemes. Memes, my guys, is something I bond with people over. Don\u2019t be afraid to show me offensive ones, but also don\u2019t be afraid of showing me even mild ones. The fact that you have any saved at all is enough for me \ud83e\udd23\n\nI\u2019m about 5\u201910\u201d, slim/athletic build, I work out regularly (best shape of my life from basic training, and I\u2019m trying to maintain that. Not gonna lie, it\u2019s incredibly hard!) and I\u2019m pretty nerdy despite not really appearing to be. So if you\u2019re nerdy, we\u2019ll get along great!! I\u2019d say I\u2019m a fan of Nintendo mostly, for games like Pok\u00e9mon and Animal Crossing. I\u2019m a bold and open person, so don\u2019t be shy.\n\nHonestly, so far, the few conversations I\u2019ve had on here have fallen flat, with the other person not responding often. I\u2019m honestly not sure why, maybe my messages aren\u2019t sending? But anyways, I do my best to be good company, so feel free to talk to me, I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m pretty harmless. I\u2019m very mild mannered in nature, but my sense of humor is pretty bold. \n\nThough I will say, I don\u2019t really like using Discord to talk to others. So that option isn\u2019t good for me!\n\nI have photos of my two kittens that still live at my family home, but if you\u2019re a sucker for either memes or cute cat photos, I\u2019ve got you.\n\nI like being social and I love comedy, basically anything funny, so don\u2019t worry about making things awkward. Because I hardly ever shut up when I feel connected to someone, when I feel that click, I just open right up!\n\nLet me know if something is bothering you though. I will become serious very quickly, and will hear out what\u2019s troubling you. I always take the struggles of my friends seriously. I can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll always be able to help, but I can promise I\u2019ll always listen and, to the best of my ability, be a kind voice to reassure you.\n\nI apologize if I\u2019m ever unable to respond or message back. My military duties always keep me so busy, so I truly do apologize in advance. If things don\u2019t get away from me, I always try to respond ASAP. Don\u2019t be afraid to remind me though. \n\nIf you want to see what I look like, I don\u2019t mind sending a photo. Just don\u2019t be strange!\n\nI\u2019m open to anyone that would like to talk.

This has been constant in my life with several people that I meet and I\u2019ve been struggling with it for the past 4 years. I love them but sometimes I feel like it gets out of hand.

My favourite tv show is gravity falls, closely followed my supernatural. Recently got into wood carving but I'm no good yet. Spend most of my days watching YouTube and playing games on my laptop. Pathetic i know. Can't wonder why my parents are concerned. On YouTube, i enjoy watching markiplier, smosh (as dumb as i know they are), the game/film theorists, thomas sanders, boyinaband, a couple different animators, and a shit ton more. Obviously. Because it's basically all i do with my time. Also i would enjoy talking about some philosophical topics if that tickles your fancy.\n\nOk if i still have your attention after all that, fantastic. Last couple things. Preferred age is 15-17. Definitely also prefer another girl. Sorry, it's just all I'd be comfortable with. I don't otherwise care about your religion, sexual orientation, race, or anything like that. However, if you try to force your beliefs (as far as religion goes) onto me, we won't get along. So there's that. I'm a picky bastard i know. Also. I don't mind if you can't message back immediately. I do have anxiety and of course that might cause mild discomfort in my head. But. I can't expect to be your first priority of course. So that's fine. As long as you're ok with me also occasionally not messaging back very fast. Kinda got depression too and i might not feel like talking. But i don't let these define me and i hope you don't define me by these things either. \n\nFantastic, you made it to the end. You have more patience than i do. Not hard to do but congrats regardless. Soooo if you feel like we may get along, let me know some things about yourself and maybe I'll shoot you a dm. I'm a paranoid person, i have to know stuff about you too before i decide to commit to trying to be your friend lol.\n\nOk uhhhh. Let's see how this goes.

Most of them are quite misanthropic and depressive.\n2. I'm crazy about metal, I mean I'm a metal head. But there are many kinds of metalheads out there, well, I'm black metalhead. I love brutal death metal as well, but black metal songs speak to me the most.\n3. I'm kinda multi instrumentalist dude. I play guitar, drums, keyboard, and a little base. Not so good at but I really like playing them.\n4. I'm trying to compose my own black metal songs, but it's really tough process to do it. I have many ideas in my head but I have to record them and sing actually. Anyway, I'm trying my best.\n5. I'm very good at computer programming as well, I can code C/C++, C#, Java, and currently learning Python. I was creating my computer game and game engine with C++ and DirectX 11.\n6. I had been awfully depressed when I was a teenager, and I was alcohol and drug addict. At that time I was always listening emo/screamo songs. I'm metal head now but I love listening to screamo bands like Silverstein.\n7. My all-time favourite novel is \"Demian\" of Hermann Hesse. It made me astonished so much because I felt it familiar as if it was written about me. With the same reason, I love \"Piano Concerto No.2\" of Rachmaninoff.\n8. I don't have a college degree because it's worthless and I can learn everything for myself. Besides, I hated school so much. School was like a prison to me, everyone did the same things and people were so dumb there. Just awful.\n9. I'm non-politic and I really hate politics. I used to be into politics seriously and I thought about so many things. But after I found they are worthless because people are just dumb, I'm totally out of it.\n10. I'm bisexual and demisexual, so I really don't care about other person's gender or sexuality. I'm not looking for a relationship now, but I'm always ready to have it if I found the person who's really deserve to give my shit.\n\nWell, it became longer than I expected.

The meningitis had the best of me, and basically murdered my cochlear\u2019s and left me profoundly deaf! Which means I can hear 0% of all the sound except the sound of \u2018deafness\u2019.\n\nBut thanks to today\u2019s generation, I was able to undergo a surgery to get an implant into my cochlear to basically resurrect my hearing by again. They successfully put in the implant on my left ear but not my right as it was too fucked up at the time (had the choice to get a second implant now but said no). So now I basically walk around with a bionic ear which is basically a microphone that picks up the sound, processes it into electronic magnet wavelengths into my cochlear implant inside my skull and magically my brain translates the energy into whatever is going on, like words, music, noise etc.\n\nSo I\u2019m basically 100% profoundly deaf, always on mute mode and when I put my bionic ear on, I unmute the world :) so safe to say I have great nights sleep!\n\nIn my title I refer you guys as the singers of the universe because that\u2019s exactly who we are, we all create the sounds and I would love to hear your instruments! :)\n\nMy interests are, writing, books, video games, entertainment, art, and most importantly, MUSIC!\n\nI\u2019m really rocking Tame Impala at the moment, probably my favourite artists this year for sure!\n\nAnyway, sorry for the long post, here\u2019s some pictures of me below!

I have recently been through a few tragic events and I do not know why but my life has begun to change. Some bad and some good. The bad has been separating with my fianc\u00e9 of 12 years and the mother of my son. I then fell sad and got in trouble with the law\u2026 Twice.. I am trying to learn from my mistakes and trying to figure out what changed in me. I feel distant and alone, but when people try to be around me or cheer me up I feel irritated. I have a good job, but for some reason I cannot be happy with it. I feel like I am not doing enough or that I am wasting my time. I have Facebook but when I try to reach out to family or real life so called friends and tell them how I feel for real they just unfriend me or tell me to be thankful for what I have. I love my son with all of my heart and wish I could see him more. Most everything is grey unless he is around. Then my attention is focused on him and his happiness. I have done and said bad things, not like murder or bank robbery but just things that I cannot take back and regret every day for doing or saying. Because of my two run-ins with the law, I cannot drive and because Facebook is full of people who ignore me, I am here. I just want a friend. Someone to talk to or be excited that they want to talk to me. I have been single for two years and am alone quite often. I do not mind my own company but I get in my own head if I have too much of only me time. I guess I am confused and looking for advice on what to do when you feel like you do not have a friend in the world. I have also been told to try to make friends at work. Trust me; I do not want to tell my horror stories and tales of loneliness to anyone that I work with. In addition, I honestly feel like none of them are genuine human beings. I work in IT and no, I am not a hacker. I am an average 35-year-old man who is average in intelligence and looks. Nothing special. However, sometimes I dream of moving around and seeing the country or other countries. That thought makes me smile. Then reality hits and I cannot do that. If I move then I loose time with my son and people say that I am chewing myself over him. My parents are also getting older and they beg me not to move because they do not know how much time they have left. I am stuck. I am alone and I just need a friend.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I'm a 27M from vegas and been off work due to an accident for about a month now and starting to go crazy, may not be for the reason you initially expect. So I got into a motorcycle accident in mid october and injured my back and had to get a surgery, and during my time in the hospital which was about a week my girlfriend of 8 years decided that was the time to break up with me. Me and her are still friends and you may have your own opinion about that, and that's totally fine. But I've seen it coming for a little while now, I feel like me and her basically became friends with benefits awhile ago but was still trying to have the facade of a \"relationship.\"  \nBuuuut, regardless of that she has been my best friend and the only person I can still talk to about certain things over the last 8 years of our relationship and is still one of my best friends even after her horrible timing lol. But she moved out, and my dad was initially visiting me for the first 3-4 weeks to make sure I was okay and could function on my own, and didn't even really want to leave when he had his flight last week, but he has a gf back home and I get why he wanted to go and didn't at the same time, and had I asked him to stay longer I know he would've. (Just adding for clarification.)

I understand the anxiety depression struggle so I don\u2019t hold it against her much, but she recently got upset with me for canceling on her and a different friend as we were supposed to hang out and they\u2019d meet my boyfriend, as something came up with his brother and I didn\u2019t find it a good time to introduce everyone. I tell them, she says \u201cok\u201d and that\u2019s all I hear.\nI find out a week later that she\u2019s mad at me, but instead of talking to me about it, she\u2019ll rant to our mutual friend or a friend of mine, which frustrates me because I let it slide when she cancels plans on me (which she does constantly) but when I cancel on her I feel she can\u2019t give me the same respect. \nShe sent me a text after a different fight we got into which I won\u2019t relay here as it\u2019s long (unless asked for), that she\u2019s upset I won\u2019t talk to her about how she feels and that she feels like a last option friend. Now I\u2019m upset again, because constantly when she asks me to hang out the says \u2018I\u2019m feeling edgy let\u2019s go on a drive\u2019, which I don\u2019t like to do because she drives scarily and I don\u2019t like drives to begin with. Sometimes though, she\u2019ll get me in the car with her saying we\u2019ll go somewhere else then when I sit down she says \u201cI know you hate drives but we\u2019re going on one\u201d. She\u2019ll tell me that she asked a mutual friend of ours to hang out, but she was busy, but if I have plans with friends before she asks me to hang out she acts like I\u2019m pushing her aside. The reason we don\u2019t hang out as often anymore is that yes, I am busy, and I have more than one group of friends and I like to spend time with all of them when I can, and when I make plans with her she cancels on me. \nShe invited our mutual friend on vacation with her, she didn\u2019t invite me, and then she talked for months about it leading up to and after the vacation, telling me flat out that she could only invite one friend so I know for a fact that I\u2019m her last resort and usually only when she\u2019s bored or she needs to let of steam.\nSo now I\u2019m just here asking, what do I do? Am I in the wrong for not wanting to be her friend anymore since she struggles with depression and anxiety? Because while I understand how hard it is, I still feel exhausted being her friend sometimes and feel like I\u2019m only around for her when it\u2019s convenient, and if I don\u2019t want to be her friend anymore that she\u2019ll stir up drama with our mutual friend about how I left her like everyone else because I don\u2019t understand or care about her mental issues.

{"post_id": "dyvtbc", "created_utc": 1574219491, "title": "Am I wrong?", "author": "DanarysStormborn", "self_text": "Finding new friends as an adult is hard. I've moved around quite a bit and it's been difficult meeting peers outside of my husband's group. When I started a new job, I became friends with Girl A. We immediately hit it off. We went to happy hour together, had double dates, the works. Enter Girl B and I also befriend her. I was sort of trying to create a squad so I was just making as much friends as I can. Girl B is different. She would constantly complain about her body, saying she is fat, etc. when it's the total opposite and just makes me feel uncomfortable about my own body (she is legit skinny and I'm this blob). She would also make up these weird stories about her crush being hot and cold with her (and cried about it), told me about this guy she was seeing that she didn't like but only seeing because she was bored (she made this entire show about dumping him) and outed a secret that I never should have told her (totally my fault for telling her). I would invite her to go to movies, have dinner with me and Girl A but she would always flake. Eventually, I decided to throw this party (which I have been planning for months) and Girl B was totally hyping it up, keeping tabs on people I invited and encouraging them to go. The day before the party, I sensed that both Girl A and Girl B weren't going. Girl B asked Girl A in front of me if she was going to the party, and Girl A did this sort of guilty sideways glance at me and said yeah I'm super excited. Girl B said she was ready to get drunk, yadda yadda. Come the day of the party, Girl A said she couldn't come because she was out with her family and had to buy gifts, etc. and it would be too far. Girl B was just silent. Didn't even say nothing. So I was pissed. When we saw each other a few days later, I couldn't help but give Girl B the cold shoulder, even though Girl A's lame excuse also annoyed me. Then I found out, Girl B went to a different party which was a surprise party for someone else that was only planned that week, and she also lied about dumping the dude. So I didn't know if I could trust her or not, so I kept my distance. She apologized for not making it (but she didn't provide any excuse, not that she was obligated to) and I forgave her cause it shouldn't be a big deal. Fast forward to a few months, Girl B has been acting like I do not exist. She would talk to Girl A in hushed tones while I'm around and even bought her a drink when she went on a Starbucks run (when she used to ask both of us if we wanted anything). Today, they were extra nice to me, only to find out that they went out to happy hour together without inviting me. I know it's not a big deal to some but I'm just annoyed at this HS bullshit.

Also on a mobile device so formatting is wonky. Thanks for reading.\r\n\r\nFirst, I'm not a very trusting person. I was bullied in middle school and ever since I found it hard to get close to people. I'm 30 and I've never had a long term relationship, if that tells you anything. Anyway, I got a really nice job about 5 years ago and bonded with a co-worker. We'll call her Emily. \r\n\r\nEmily and I hit it off well. She was older than me, but married and had 2 kids. We were both overweight, but not excessively. And we were both in a rough spot in life. She with her marriage and me just trying to figure out what to do with my life. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I opened up to her. Shared my secrets. I thought we were going to be long time friends. I've honestly never had one before because I tend to get rid of people if they get too close, but it was easy with her. We both got on a diet and lost weight, motivated each other. Things got really difficult at work. Corporate office problems. So she left and went to work at a bank. We hung out together outside of work all the time and I was happy for her, I knew we\u2019d maintain our friendship. Boy, was I wrong.\n\r\nAfter working at the bank for a few weeks I suspected she might have accessed my account (I banked at that branch). And we were good friends, but I felt like that was crossing the line. My suspicions came about because my dad went to the bank and she was the greeter that day. She signed him in, talked to him (she\u2019d met him before). Later that day I talked to her as usual and I ended up sharing some personal information about my brother. It\u2019s very important to note here, this was AFTER my dad visited the branch. A couple of days later, she brought the information up about my brother again and proceeded to explain that \u201cshe wasn\u2019t snooping, but she noticed some important information on my brothers account pertaining to secret I shared with her\u201d I was furious to say the least so I asked \u201cwhat were you doing in my brothers account?\u201d Mind you, he lives in another state and has only met her once. So I know he wasn\u2019t at the branch. She tells me that when my dad came in, she used my brothers account to access my dad\u2019s because it was 'easier'. My brother and my dad have different last names and their accounts aren\u2019t joint accounts. Also, she said she did this after hearing the secret. But how if my dad was there before? It didn\u2019t seem right, but I let it go because I wanted to make sure I didn\u2019t overreact.\n\r\nSeveral days passed and it was bothering me like you wouldn\u2019t believe. It\u2019s my bank account. It\u2019s private regardless of our friendship. If she accessed my brother\u2019s, what was stopping her from opening mine? So I called the bank. I tried to do this anonymously. My intention was not aimed at getting her in trouble. I wanted the bank to tell me no one accessed my account and to stop being paranoid. I refused to provide her name or anything, but after speaking with a call center agent, a supervisor and then being called back by someone in security I was told the only way they could tell me was if I told them who I was concerned about. Seemed odd to me because I think they can see whose accessed my account at a particular branch, but I had to know so I gave them her name. They told me she hadn\u2019t accessed my account and not to worry. I explained how my suspicions were born, but did not tell them that she gave me information off my brothers account, just that she mentioned she opened it to get to my dad\u2019s. I didn\u2019t want her to get fired over any of this and I know leaking someone else\u2019s information is a huge violation. I didn\u2019t know where accessing an account without permission fell, but I stopped caring because she\u2019s a grown woman and should know better.\n\r\nTwo or three days later Emily messages me to say \u201cim sorry if I offended you by telling you about your brothers account. My supervisor had a chat with me today. I didn\u2019t access your account and never would I explained why I accessed your brothers I didn\u2019t know it would bother you so much\u201d we talked about it for a while and said our I love you\u2019s and I\u2019m sorry that this escalated like this. I thought we were over it, but she never spoke to me again. \n\r\nShe no longer works at the bank, but I don\u2019t think she got fired. I knew she wasn\u2019t happy there in the short few weeks and she had another opportunity in the works. She may have gotten fired and didn\u2019t want to tell me. I have no way of knowing. I'm also not going to beg someone so after a few weeks of no communication I moved on from the whole situation. \n\r\nIt still bothers me though. I know I was being paranoid, but I feel like it was warranted. Was she wrong or was I supposed to have handled it differently? I miss her so much and it eats me up to think I ruined it all over a stupid bank account. What could I have done differently? Is it worth it to try and reach out to her again after 2-3 months of no communication?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I had 1-2 who were even more social than me so they had other friends too. In the end of primary school, it was decided that we would go different high schools each other, so I was sure that I would never have friends again.Although,the first days in high school I find new friends, 3 or 4 guys, we started going out together, we played football together,we discussed any problem we had, etc. We ended up spending all day together and we soon became best friends. This was happening from our 12s until our 15s.Then,one summer I went to my village on vacation, as I always used to do, and they stopped talking to me.At first I thought it was because I was in my village, but everyone of them, since the school season was over went on their village, and we were talking after 2 months (we didn't have Facebook, etc and we rarely talked on the phone,usually we were talking around 15-20 July, in the mid of the summer because it was my birthday, but we didn't talk that summer). So, I said to myself, don't worry, when I return to my home, I will call them to go out. I returned in the end of the summer, 2-3 weeks before the new school season. I called them 5-10 times but they did not answer.It was kinda usual not to answer to the calls, so I said I would go out to find them in our places. I went and still didn't find them. Finally, I found them after almost a week trying , 3 of the guys were in our city, avoiding me, and the other guy was still in his village but he was talking with them. So, that season we stopped talking, I started talking to 2 new people, a boy and a girl. After almost 7 years we are still not the best friends, but at least we have somene to talk to. My ex-friends continued hanging out,I think until 3 years ago because 2 of them went to another city, and the other 2 left each other. I would like to ask you, what could have been wrong and they left me? I mean we were all like the same person, always together and we had fun. Am I bad that I am happy that they left each other, is this like a kind of revenge? And what can I do to start trusting people again? I never had a serious relationship, not even a relationship, only kissed a girl once, she liked me but that time I was not able to do something.It was some weeks after the incident with my friends, so I was hurt and worried and I didn't know if I could.\n\nPS,\nAfter the high school was over (before 6 years,2 years after they left me), I had an idea of messaging one of them, maybe if we can go out for a beer or something, but then I remembered how idiot I would be to do this, and I immediately rejected this idea.\n\nSorry for my English", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Problem solved.\u201d \n\nBut I can\u2019t tell you how much it hurts to be constantly reminded about that fact. I think anyone would start to take it to heart after being told so many times. It\u2019s especially a sensitive subject for me since I\u2019ve been rejected by two potential romantic partners under the same circumstances: I love you like a sister. \n\nMy bestie always talks about how she\u2019s had a crush on pretty much every friend she\u2019s ever had\u2014always apologizing sheepishly that I was not one of them.

I know my personality isn\u2019t going to jive with everyone and that platonic love and romantic love are different. I\u2019m perfectly content just being friends with her for our entire lives, but these comments that she makes really hurt because it feels like I\u2019m the only friend she has that she holds to this weird \u201cundateable\u201d standard. It makes me feel very unlovable, but perhaps that\u2019s just on me. I have low self esteem and have been perpetually single for years now. Maybe I\u2019m projecting or making problems that aren\u2019t there. \n\nDo I confront her about this? Do I just leave it alone and suck it up and get over it? I wish I didn\u2019t feel like this. We\u2019re very good friends but when she says things like this, it\u2019s a bit condescending and makes me feel that I value the friendship we have a lot more than she does. For once, it would be nice to feel like someone was as invested in me as I am in them. I\u2019m not asking her to say she\u2019d date me. I\u2019m asking her to stop saying she never would. Is that asking for something unreasonable? \n\nThanks for listening.

No one cares to listen to me though. Just get a lot of abuse sent my way instead. Sick of it. I've been shot at, had knives pulled on me, got sexually assaulted when I was 20. I've been through Hell no one cares. I find it difficult to leave the house these days. Increasingly increasingly difficult to go places do things. Like I talk to people online mosty, it's like getting rocks thrown at me, that's what it feels like stone. Few have been nice. Maybe I'm a bit sensitive. But the few people I did let into my life over the years shook me up a lot. Quite fragile because of them. I break easily. Have to be handled delicately especially since I just went to a mental hospital last month but instead people are tossing me around like I'm nothing and like it doesn't matter. They were nice in there, but outside it's a completely different story.\n\n\nThis was what I  posted to kindvoice last week I think I'll post it again here summarizes things fairly well: \n\n\nPeople in my life have been horrible. Have been dealing with social anxiety since I was a kid. Had a dad with bad anger issues and was bullied constantly because of the way I looked. Was agoraphobic and isolated myself for large parts of my life. But I was doing so well building up my confidence self esteem doing things for myself - lost weight got in shape got my degree saved up money moved out of state quit drinking when I was 27 but then got shakened up by awful people and came plummeting right back into all of my old social anxiety and agoraphobia and isolating myself. I go so long without speaking to anyone. Have had very few friends in my life and the few that I've had all of them without exception turned on me betrayed me in a huge way. Haven't been in a relationship after a 50 year old woman got me drunk and took my virginity without my consent when I was 20. Was kicked out by my dad and living in a boarding house with a lot of drug addicts and criminals at the time. Sound of gunshots going off keeping me up at night. I've been shot at. Had knives pulled on me. Guy from the Aryan Brotherhood was trying to groom me and recruit me while I was living there. Never ever wanted to be around such things. Was always trying to keep to myself. I used to get straight A's in school was considered nerdy when I was a kid.\n\n\nI just want someone to talk to. Someone really kind and who will be patient. Could someone write even if I don't respond? At least I might not respond immediately. I have a lot of obscure interests that no one else has so it's useless to bring up but I don't care about having the same interests. Just a ridiculously friendly and happy person. Because I am not at all happy. My outlook on things is fairly bleak. It's just everything and everyone feels harsh like concrete would so appreciate a kind voice. Afraid it's futile though and doesn't exist.\n\n\nAlso I am a bit drug and alcohol damaged. I have severe depression. Of course who'd want to talk with someone like me. Worst thing craziest thing about me is that when I was 24 I tried to cut my finger off while in public. Wasn't on drugs or drunk at the time. Was my Van Gogh moment. People are usually put off the few times I mentioned it. I feel like I frighten people off. But I'm really harmless. I feel like a monster people always encounter me like I'm a monster but I wouldn't hurt anyone I'm actually really timid and shy. Don't know if anyone would want to talk to someone like me though. Everything is really cold and unforgiving in that way. I'm one of those people stranded like on a desert island even in the middle of a city.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I feel really bad since shes genuinely a good person and actually good at art. I had just said an offhanded comment   because i was offended which ended up seeming like an insult to her. I really hate the negative feelings between us and have already apologised many times but it seems like she will be self concious about it. Idk what to do because she was genuinely hurt by what i said.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

{"post_id": "dza74e", "created_utc": 1574292400, "title": "Pleasee help", "author": "Nolikeshit1", "self_text": "I have this bff who I'll call \"Alex\" she's 20yrs old and shes pretty and average size then me who is 2yrs and a bit bigger than her and have been friends for 13 years. Our friendship hasnt always been the best and lately its been worse because I feel like ive always let her boss me around and treat me differently than her other friends and just overall try to control me. Okay so here's the backstory we meet in 2nd grade shes the first person who came up and talked to me and were cool but then at recess she'd throw basketballs at my head, we'd play barbies at her house and shed always give me the ugly dolls and ugly clothes. Around middle school is when she started acting like a real bitch she would always pick at my insecurties or say thing's about how I looked. Then highschool time I was 15 &amp; I lived about 2 hours away from her and had no car and wasnt even living with my parents because I was put out and she would get mad that I wouldn't come see her and called me fake because of it. Another example is this time she asked me to come over and I walked about 3 hrs from where I was and my feet were hurting so bad and she wanted to go walk somewhere else so she took my cellphone and started walking in that direction forcing me to follow then she wouldn't give it back until it died, I was mad asf at her but she didnt see the problem. She hates all my friends and doesnt want to hang out with them but will bug me and call me fake because I dont want to hang out with a girl that shes friends with who she knows Ive disliked for a long time but I still went over there with her a few times. She even had this other friend who told her she didnt like me but continued to be friends with these people.\nAnyways back to around highschool when she graduated I missed her graduation because of personal reasons and she was upset over it and I get it it was a big deal but I couldnt make it and had no way there ontop of my reason. But she says thats something she'll never forgive me for. Also I feel like im im debt with her because she always tells me that I owe her wich Is why I now hate when she offers to buy me something because when ever she wants something of mine im supposed to just give it to her because I owe her... for ex. We were in a store  one day and I saw this yellow purse and she said it was ugly but I loved it because I love yellow and so I.got it, once we left the store and I was wearing the purse she told me to let her have it and I said no and she said that I owed her for all shes done for me so.I.should give it to her. So I cut her off for a few days. Anyways back to 3 years ago she starts dating her manager whos and adult while shes in school she was 17 he was 26 and she lost her virginity to him and stuff their still together but he lives about 1 hr and 30mins away and they see each other on weekends or sometimes he'll come for a few days but whenever he does come she would leave me and I was okay with that or cancel our plans because he suddenly was coming over and now im currently dating somebody who we'll call \"chad\" so anyways chad would come over and alex would say tell him to go home so we can hang out but I wouldnt because I knew she wouldnt do that with her boyfriend and now me and chad are living together but alex wont come over if hes here because she claims she gets bad vibes from him but they were cool when they worked together and never had a problem. Shes never liked any of my boyfriends tho and its annoying how she expects me to drop everything for her like if her and her current boyfriend breaks up (they do sometimes) she wants me to come over and be with her but when me and chad broke up she wouldnt come see me cause she was with her boyfriend. And recently I had a birthday and it was my 21st all my friends and my boyfriend were working. I was upset the most because  alex and I were supposed to.hang out but then she said she had work and couldnt call out because she had too many points and could get fired. I was upset but I understood...until the next day when she called out of work because she was too tired to go so that made me mad and I confronted her and she said shed rather call out for her reason than a birthday because I wanted her to shift her schedule around but didnt want to shift mine. I feel like were still friends just because weve been friends so long. She can be so judgemental. Like she says im a slut when ive had sex with 2 people and shes only been with one. Then she tells other people how all of her friends are hoes and shes just innocent lmao like those are her exact words she always talks about being innocent and shit but she lies so much like her boyfriend can never know who she hangs out with or what she does or how she really acts because he doesnt like her music or who shes around. She still hangs out with her ex boyfriend  who keeps asking her for sex but she says no but has him smoke weed with her then theres her boy bestfriend who is trying to get with her and she has him smoke with her too. On one of her brief break ups to her current boyfriend she went to a exs house and kissed him and was playing with his dick then got back with her boyfriend the next day.. Anyways back to today she messages me and tells me how she feels like.things are different between us and Idk why shes acting confused because I tell her to come over all the time but she wont because chads here and I text her and check up on her and she barely responds or responds with one word. Basically my only options are to go to her house and do what she wants or come to my house when hes gone which is annoying because I feel like she tries to control my house like she tries to tell me which side of MY BED is mine and wont let me sit in my spots lmao I know that sounds childish but I like sitting on my side of my bed im grown \ud83d\ude02. But yea im done ranting now I just want somw advice on what to do because clearly im a bitter bitch atp \u2639 and I don't really want to be.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

There were 7 of us that were really close, the next year of being friends things started going downhill. \n\nSo one of the people, (let's call him Andrew), started a fight with another, (let's call her Rachel), despite being the closest in the group. I feel like Andrew only talks to me because of Rachel or for my weed. Anyway, somehow I got involved and sided with Rachel, so Andrew decided to blow up at me, telling me to \"grow the fuck up\", \"he's done with my shit\" \"I need to stop acting high and mighty\", and \"everything that's happening right now is on you\", and essentially ignored me for weeks. \n\nThen one day, Andrew makes amends with Rachel and they're best buds again, except Andrew still ignores me. So I know I was in the wrong for getting involved, so I talked to him and apologized. But he refuses to acknowledge that he did anything wrong to me, and it makes me feel like he doesn't value my friendship or feelings as much, even after I told him. \n\nSo now I just feel like I'm getting cut out by Andrew and Rachel. Rachel barely talks to me anymore, but is close with everyone else, especially Andrew. I even got cut out of her living plans for next year. I have some mental health issues, but so do they. They make me feel super self-conscious about it though. I feel like they all talk about me behind my back, and whisper to each other when I'm around and I say something.  It's emotionally exhausting even being around them, and I feel judged all the time to where I don't even want to talk. I feel like the only person who I am still close with in the group talks to me because we're fuck buddies, and not because of my friendship.\n\nI've thought that they just don't like me as a person, but if that is the case, I've asked them to tell me if they have a problem with me, and they said they didn't. I know by their actions that I'm not a priority or mean much to them, so I have been hanging out with them less and spending more time with my other friends, but it still hurts because I live with three of them. \n\nI've been gaslighted before, so before I jump to conclusions I want to know if I'm overrreacting.

I have horrible grammar, sometimes people say I dont make sense, and also I am always joking around and I guess people take offense to that sometimes. I dont mean anything negative by it I laugh at myself more then anyone. I also have no hobbies and am not good at anything..... no you dont understand i am good at nothing at all. Plus on top of that I'm so busy between keeping my house upkept, working my job, and church stuff sometimes people wont get but maybe 5 messages from me a night and get mad at me.

Usually I get along with females more then males. But that's just usually and not all the time.

And just because I mentioned my religion doesnt mean I will judge people with other beliefs nor with I force my religion down your throat. If we want to have a peaceful conversation about it some time I am more then happy to have a civilized conversation. I guess the one and only thing I am is kind. I guess that's good.

So far, all of us had gotten along fairly well. As expected, there have been little conflicts here and there, all of which had been solved and put behind us. But as of late, four out of six (the six includes me) of my closest school friends have been absolutely toxic to each other. My friends, who I'll refer to by the first letter of their first names, have split into two groups of two while me and my best friend, who also is neutral, have been encouraged to choose a side. I attempted to be diplomatic and fair, so I discussed the situation with my best friend (neutral) who I'll call V and we decided that we'll both individually talk to both groups and base our decisions about who is in the wrong based on that. Once we did so, we both agreed that the second group, O and S, are in the wrong for talking behind my other friends, M and B's, backs. They even lied directly to my face even though I have evidence that clearly proves them wrong. Even worse, they have talked badly about V as soon as she left their table (V overheard them and a different friend, not part of the six, told V) and denied that when V confronted O and S. When I talked to M and B, they explained that S is distancing O from everyone else and that S is jealous of M for her looks and her popularity. M and B also said that S and O We're planning to go to the mall with V (I wasn't able to attend due to strict parents),  but cancelled once they found out  M and B were going as well. Together, V and I were able to comfirm M and B's claims and decided to do something. Tomorrow, I'm planning to confront O and S by myself about all of this. Is that a good idea?

And by friend, i mean long term friendship.\n\nMaybe, i should give my TED talk first. I've been trying to find friend here on reddit for a month now. Posted a few times here, some were really trying to hold conversation others not so much, but i know they wanted to, cause why would they bother to send me a message if they don't read my long ass post. So, i thought, you should just tell me what's been bothering your mind now. Anything. Honesty is the best thing to start a friendship. I can't guarantee you i could give you good advice, but we'll work it out later. Friendship is a long process, especially with finding one via online. Nothing instant there. So let's not try to hard to meet expectations of other. Just be yourself.\n\nFor anyone who also been having difficulty finding friend here, don't lose hope yet, many kind people here, well, creeps too, but that's not the point here, there's always negative side of positive one.

I guess you could say that I'm going through a depressive period in my life right now. Depression (and anxiety) is something that I have struggled with quite a bit through my life, but it usually don't get as bad as it currently is. I have been trying to figure out how to fix it and I have talked to my therapist about it too. Together we managed to conclude what the reason behind my increased depression might be, and I'll spare you the details; in short, I think I'm just very lonely. People generally don't have the time to do things with each other anymore, not even friends, it's kinda sad, but that's just how life is I guess. But yeah, sorry if I'm going on for too long, but I felt it was important to tell you the \"why\" before I tell you the \"what\". The figurative \"what\" being that I think I need friends, or someone to talk to or play games together with, perhaps just a few nice words would cheer me up. I don't know.\n\nAnyway, I'll proceed to talk a little bit about me as a person and my interests, so you can decide if you'd like to send me a message/become my friend or not. So yeah, other than being 20 years old, I also live in Sweden (so you can talk to me in swedish if you also happen to be swedish), I'm male (I don't know if that's even important to mention, but perhaps some people might think it is) and I see myself as an ambivert (or perhaps a shy extrovert), but some people keep telling me that I'm \"such an introvert\", I'm also mostly calm, friendly, open and honest but also quite scatter-brained. I also have ADHD and ASD, which sometimes makes social situations and such a challenge, I also feel like I have a hard time getting along as friends, or \"clicking\", with most people because of it, not necessarily because I or them are inherently unlikable or impolite, but rather because I don't easily relate or talk to people that I don't share any interest or hobby in common with. So I might accidentally make things awkward by talking about stuff that interests me but they don't care at all about. Speaking of which, you might wonder what my interests and hobbies are, so I'll list them (or at least the ones that comes to my mind):\n\n* I'm very interested by personality typology; MBTI, the enneagram, the big 5, etc. It's interesting to read up about, and also to theorize about how it might relate to other things, like taste in music or what type of video games certain personality types might prefer over all, etc.\n* I'm interested by politics, but I don't have a lot of strong opinions on actual policies and such though, I'm more interested in understanding the philosophical and historical part of it.\n* Philosophy in general is pretty interesting.\n* I play theater and I draw stuff sometimes (mostly pixel art as of late).\n* I like to listen to music and to find new stuff that I haven't heard before. When it comes to genres, I like a lot, everything from black metal and post-rock to j-pop and lo-fi indie.\n* I play video games, both on Switch and PC. Game's that I own include (but are not at all limited to): Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Splatoon 2, Astroneer, Overwatch and Minecraft.\n* I like to learn random facts about pretty much everything (space, animals, paleontology, etc), I can spend hours watching youtube videos or watching documentaries.\n* I do watch some series/cartoons/animes, but not a lot of them. Idk why, it's something about that kind of media format that fails to keep me interested for long. I prefer video games to watching series, I guess mainly because video games are more interactive.\n* Memes are also neat.\n\nThat feels like enough I think, sorry if I went on for too long. Anyway, feel free to send me a DM if you think we will get along, or just add me on Discord: borkendork#2255 I'm the most active on there anyway. Oh and idk how many responses I'll get, but imma say this just in case, if I get a lot of them/more than I can handle, then I might not answer to each and every one of them.

All im tryi to do is find a friend whos mostly interested in what i like to do. But i guess i cant share my opinion on reddit cause i guess they are so self centered and fucking lazy that they send out bots to do their job for them. Some of these post the bots shouldnt remove but they do remove them cause reddit doesnt care about others all they care about how they want to govern reddit. But isnt reddit suppose to be the social media for the world with no discrimination. Idk but reddit has changed from what i use to see it as. Now they just dont care which is sad. The reason why im preaching to the quire is to give reddit and the rude people on here to accept people for who they are and dont force them to be someone else. Also for the reddit mods i know you guys are probably going to remove this thread and put it in your discard folder and forget about it till it gets too full then you guys will realise what you are doing to these innocent people who are just trying to look for their match. I am not happy with you reddit not at all and if you are confused on why i am not happy why dont you look in your stupid bots archive folder and read my other dam threads you all archived. If you cant even do that then i guess your guyses brains are the size of a pea or even smaller cause you guys just dont care anymore about others. Alsow whe. Reddit gets officialy shut down in the future dont come crying to me cause all i will say is i already gave you a warning this will happen. Lastly for everyone else who doesnt give a shit about other people trying to find their mate then grow up cause if you dont you will be lonely for the rest of your lives so be nice to people and respect that they are actually trying unlike you guys. Also reddit be nice to these people too cause you guys arent letting them vent at all. These people put time into trying to find their happiness and all you do is crush their hopes and dreams. I hope you other bullies and reddit will actually read this instead of making your bot do it for you. When you guys arent so dam lazy and inmature then come talk to me. \n\nNow for what i was meant to put in this thread is i really need someone who would accept me ive been bullied all my life and i just want to feel safe with friends i can trust but the problem is i dont have anyone to trust cause i have no friends. If you care and want to be my friend please read my  intro bellow and send mea private message i would really appreciate it. \n\n\n\nName: Brian\nAge: 20\nGender: Male\nMood: Random\nSexuality: Straight\nStatus: Single\nCountry: USA\nState: KY\nCity: Fort Wright\n\n\nOnline activity: On and off (mainly because my parents dont give me my personal space that i deserve)\n\nMy Personality: People describe me as nice, kind, considerate, helpful, and funny, I am also a bit of an introvert\n\nThings I Dislike: Rudeness, Chores, Loneliness, and my parents.\n\nSome of my hobbies include: PC Gaming, building computers and DIY Projects.\n\nWhy I\u2019m here: I\u2019m looking for friends who will accept me for who I am, and would like to hang out with me or play video games. It would be ideal if you live near me and would be open to meeting in person if we become friends. Not looking to date unless we really click that way.\n\nPS: I can be a bit shy at times when we first meet people. Also there is one thing i dont like telling people cause they judge me about why i want this. Also they get really nervious around me when i talk about it i just want someone i can hang out with and get to know. The thing that i want is a girl that would let me touch her hair but when i ask and if its ok with them ill do it but thats what im super nervious about is people thinking im a creap when i touch girls hair.\n\nI also have an essay about my past life experience: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CcrirdQtQHW23ZTlQ8N9YOt7A97h8au_wQVPSTAd0Tg/edit?usp=sharing.\u00a0\n\nIf you think we could be friends please ping or DM me.\n\n\nDear Reddit: Just letting you guys know it took me an hour to make this thread so please dont bullshit it k.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I've been to france and germany and i think both countries are amazing. I am moving to germany to study computer science.\n\n**What am i like as a person?** chatty , genuine , nice , respectful , cheerful.\n\nI try to make the best out of any situation. I try and smile everyday but some days its too hard to smile. Everyone has those days. You can only appreciate the good ones if you have those bad ones here and there haha. I will try and get to know you but I don't really like too much framing around the conversation. I kind of just want to let our minds spill and our tongues roll. That's the best way to know someone imo. Doesn't need to be question / answer format.\n\n**My interests ?** To be honest with you i'm open to and interested in a lot of stuff even though i may not be spending time doing them but one day when i have the time i look forward to it. I recently joined a **gym** to lift weights. It helps keep my mind off things and makes me feel better to have body goals etc. I have a punching bag at home. It helps relieve stress. I am interested in **martial arts** because of it and i've been watching videos and learning combos and how to punch/shadow **box** and all that. I plan to join an **mma** gym next year. I love **reading** , however i don't read as much since it's really hard to find english books here. My fav book is the fault in our stars. I love **pc video games** both singleplayer and multiplayer. My favourite are probably the witcher 3 , skyrim and assassin creeds. I also play a bunch of popular multiplayer ones like overwatch, csgo , lol, rainbow six siege, apex, pubg , and other games. I assure you we probably have some games in common if you wanna play. I am a fan of **cinema** and **anime** .\n\nI love **tv shows** like game of thrones, vikings, breaking bad, lucifer , this is us. **Movies** like interstellar , shutter island , the dark knight and **anime** like tokyo ghoul , hunter x hunter and full metal alchemist.\n\nOther than that i love **travelling** , maybe one day we can travel together!! I want to **backpack** one day across europe and asia. I feel like it would be a great experience to meet new people , make new memories and to learn more about myself. I'm a fan of **motorcycles** and plan to get my license and buy one in the next few years. I will prob be content with a 650cc for years to come though!\n\nI love **swimming**. My country is a half island and has beautiful beaches. I've never been **scuba diving** but that's on my bucket list. I also **fish** from time to time with a rod and i love to **cook** . I also recently bought an acoustic **guitar** so i'm learning that.\n\nI know this is long and hopefully that will filter out people who are just looking for a one time chat cause that's definitely not what what i had in mind. I'm looking for long term friendships. Genuine care and interest in one another. People i can have a laugh with and talk to at the end of a long day, people i can trust and meet up and travel with one day or do other fun/crazy activies. People i can bond with. I am okay with texting at first but i definitely prefer voicechats as our main communication method. So please do message me , let's get to know each other , we can game , watch random vids together , talk about life , bingewatch a show or some anime , enjoy a horror movie.\n\nHave a good day.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Secondly, I'd love to start a friendship with a Muslim person, as a recent convert and living in a country with one of the lowest amount of followers of Islam in the world - I'm struggling to practise my religion in a proper way and I believe that having someone to talk about faith with, would be very much beneficial. I like to mix both long and deep discussions about certain topics with rather casual, daily talk. I'm up to messaging apps, Reddit DMs, e-mails and even traditional letters - whatever suits you best. If the second person is willing to, we could even send each other some packages with traditional snacks/postcards or hand-made things, that sounds exciting. From my personal experience I tend to have better connections with women as they mostly are more patient and up for longer and more engaging talks, but I accept everyone no matter the gender/age or ethnicity.\n\nFew more things about me:\n\n\\- I'm a rather calm person that doesn't like to party and is free of alcohol or any drugs\n\n\\- I love nature, going for a walk in a forest, walk by a lake or visiting parks\n\n\\- Riding a bike alongside with listed above long walks are my favourite forms of spending time outside\n\n\\- For a good year I've been massively struggling health-wise, but now getting better\n\n\\- I'm free from prejudices and stay off from politics\n\n\\- I don't like memes much and not find most of them particularly funny\n\n\\- I used to listen to metal music, but lately I almost completely switched to Psybient/Psychill/Chillstep/Spacebient and Nasheeds\n\n\\- I follow football a lot, but mainly fixtures of my national league\n\n\\- I'm very interested into games and I'd be willing to play some online ones with you\n\n\\- I like to make some photos and videos of my daily life and would like to share it with you\n\n\\- I try to eat healthy\n\n\\- I stay away from the NSFW content\n\n\\- Recently I've started to learn Arabic\n\n\\- I don't have any pet, but I love watching various videos about them and play with ones that belong to my family\n\n\\- I'm a person that is willing to listen, support and give honest opinions on different matters", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

She\u2019s been giving us looks and hints to try to make us feel jealous of her but if I\u2019m honest I have nothing to be jealous about, me and her are quite similar in fact the only differences are she has a boyfriend and a controlling personality .

She was the one who was there every time I\u2019d had a problem , she defended me every time people made fun of me for my TS . And I was there for her , throughout everything from her grandads passing to her self harm . And now she\u2019s ditched me at the height of my self harm and depression , my grandma found out two weeks ago that I\u2019ve been self harming more and more recently and I\u2019m really trying to get better but I need to do more than just on my own . \n\nMe Caitlin and her boyfriend were best friends over the summer , we spent almost every day together without fail and became so close we openly spoke about how if we didn\u2019t have each other we wouldn\u2019t be able to go on . \n\nHow can I try to get back on my feet ? And how can I get over this issue ? If she\u2019s going to ditch me like that I don\u2019t want to give her another chance when she\u2019ll just knock me down again . \nHow can I not mourn the friendship ?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Help!", "author": "Parkie89", "self_text": "Long story.\n\nI\u2019ve had a friend since we were in middle school. We\u2019ve been there for each other for everything life had thrown at us for almost 20 years. We know each other\u2019s families and share our closest friends. We even have matching tattoos! \n\nShe began dating a man who lives 4 hours away (we live in a very rural area) two years ago. Last December she mentioned myself and another friend meeting him for the first time. He ranches, so he\u2019s extremely busy a lot of the time. She tentatively set up a dinner on New Years Eve, but continuously reinforced that he might not make it. In the mean time I began dating a man, who invited me to go skiing with his closest friends and his brother over NYE. I put off replying to his invite, hoping to have a concrete answer from my friend before I committed to either plan. \n\nWhen I didn\u2019t hear from her by Christmas, I pulled the trigger and told the man I was dating I\u2019d go skiing. When I told my friend that was my plan the next day, she exploded and was extremely upset. I apologized profusely and offered to cancel on my (now) boyfriend. She told me to forget it. I went skiing, had a blast, and have now happily been with this guy for over a year. \n\nMy friend\u2019s boyfriend did end up coming up that weekend and met her parents for the first time. I knew she was still upset, so I apologized to her several more times and told her how truly horrible I felt, both on text and in person, and that I regretted it and if I had known it was such a big deal, I would have never even considered the ski trip. I figured since they were so serious, there would be plenty of opportunity in the future to meet up. Finally in May she told me she was \u201cover it\u201d.  In the meantime I kept asking when a good time to meet up was, and invited them both to several events. She told me he was just too busy every time.\n\nFast forward through a summer of awkward passive aggression.\n\nThis October, TEN MONTHS after I bailed on her, we were planning my 30th birthday festivities and I told her the only thing I really wanted was to meet her boyfriend. \u201cHow could he refuse coming to my milestone birthday party?!\u201d I asked her, jokingly.  She told me, \u201cI don\u2019t think guilt will work on him, especially after last time\u201d... when I joked about \u2018forgiveness\u2019 (they are both pretty devout Christians) she told me \u201cHe just saw me really hurt, for a really long time\u201d, and that she hasn\u2019t felt \u201cready to allow\u201d me to meet him because I \u201chadn\u2019t been acting sorry enough\u201d (?!). \n\nI am extremely hurt. They are now planning their wedding and I haven\u2019t even met the guy. Every time she brings him up it upsets me more. I don\u2019t know how to \u201cact more sorry\u201d... I\u2019ve apologized sincerely, and profusely, in person and on text. It\u2019s to the point that I feel dread every time I think about meeting him, and every time she brings him up (which is all the time) it makes me feel worse.\n\nI know I screwed up- ditching your friend for a guy is a cardinal sin.\n\nAm I in the wrong here? Is it normal to be upset for almost a year for missing one get together? How can I make a better impression on this man? Am I being immature being upset about this? How can I fix this?

Hotels in places like vegas have resort charges that are not due when you initially book the hotel but when you check in. My friend booked the hotel, paying ~$850 on his card and the resort charges of ~$150 to be paid at check in. Being the good friends that we are, we pay our shares to him quickly so he isn\u2019t out of pocket for a long time. The resort charges were split between the 4 of us that were going and paid to this friend because we figure it would be easier for him to just pay the hotel at check in. \n\nFast forward to the day before we leave and this friend decides to back out last minute. There was no emergency, just that he didn\u2019t realise that our trip was 6 days long. He didn\u2019t think he could miss school for that much. He didn\u2019t find someone to replace him on the trip, only saying that he wasn\u2019t going anymore. At check in, i ended up paying the resort charges on my card because they were due then. \n\nWhen we come back, i explain the situation to my friend and how i needed him to refund me the $150 that was given to him before. He said he understood but the next time i brought it up, he said \u201cit\u2019s wrong for me to pay anything. i didn\u2019t even go\u201d. I tried explaining again to him that the money wasn\u2019t his to begin with since he was meant to use it to pay the hotel but he refuses refund me saying that it is completely wrong for him to return the money to me. In reality, i\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s taking my $150 to try offset his loss of his share of the hotel costs. His last message to me was - \u201cif you don\u2019t have anything new to say, stop messaging me. i\u2019m not paying anything\u201d.

Let's name the other 2 friends A and B. rewind to around this time of last year me and friend A had a bit of a fallout no fight she just needed space from me(no there was no romance involved). no big deal because I knew friend B was in her life, and I knew all was well. Besides A and B were practically like sisters well while me and Friend A didn't talk, we still very much considered each other friends. As the year passed, me and friend B became close. So close that people practically assumed we were dating, perhaps we both wanted it, but I was not ready because I was not in a good place.\n\ni knew if i ever wanted to get serious about B i needed to get it together. so i took time away from B to focus on me and become a better version of me that could make her happy. 5 months went by since me and B had talked, and 6 months since i had talked to A. when i finally returned to B I found out she was dating some so that friendship became awkward. as a good friend, I ended up asking about A.  she told me she had stopped being friends with A because she felt friend A was being mentally abusive to her which to me was complete bs because neither one of them is capable of abusing a person. Friend B told friend A she needed space and ended their friendship. I reconnected with friend A and got her side of the story which to me sounds like the correct version. which is nothing more than a disagreement.  but friend A is completely destroyed because her best friend abandoned her.\n\nIm left to pick up the pieces of friend A whos holding on to hope that friend B will come back. i see friend B all the time since we share pretty much the same group of friends. Not only does she seem happy with her bf i don't think she thinks or is ever going to reach out to friend B ever again. In the meantime friend B has been left with no closure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to do should i ask B to talk to A and risk whatever little awkward friendship we have left? or let it work it self out?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

My other friend, let\u2019s call her Jennie painted her crush\u2019s name on her arm. Jennie told me to take a photo of it, and I did and showed her crush the photo. Then, Alice desperately tried to take the paint off (it was acrylic, so all she had to do was rub it off) she went to the teacher and told her, and a bunch of the teacher\u2019s pet who constantly bullied Alice for her weird looks and behaviors, started asking what was wrong with us and why would we do that. We felt incredibly bad, so after that class she briefly walked out of class. Jennie and I went to Alice and apologized to her and we asked if she was mad at us many times, all of the times she said no. We tried to make it up to her by buying her candy which she loved like heck. She took them and went to wait for the next class. Jennie and I talked about how we shouldn\u2019t have done it and that we missed her already. We went up to her and say next to her and she stood up and went to another spot, so we decided to give her space. Fast track to a few hours later, we\u2019re at break, since we were giving Alice some space we decided to play around with the boys and we started a water fight (keep this in mind.) We had the next period free because our teacher didn\u2019t show up, so we decided to go. After a few minutes, Jennie\u2019s friend with Alice comes up to us, she starts asking us why we didn\u2019t defend Alice when she was being made fun of, I hope you kept in mind that we were running from the boys because we were having a water fight with them. We explained it to Jennie\u2019s friend and Alice and she said it was no excuse to leave her like that. She gets angry and storms off with Alice. Now we were in the last class of the day, I went over to Alice and explained to her that I can\u2019t always be there when she\u2019s getting bullied, and that I\u2019m sorry and still wanted to be her friend. She ignored me the whole time while Jennie\u2019s friend watched me. She then later, texted me after school that she only wanted to be friends with Jennie\u2019s friend. No matter how many times I apologized she still wasn\u2019t taking our apology. It\u2019s been almost a month since that has happened, I have still been nice to her the whole time. Yesterday she was talking to me like I was her friend again and it\u2019s like she remembered she\u2019s supposed to ignore me and got back to ignoring me. I try to make small talk but all she does is nod her head, no single word. I asked to have lunch with her today and she shrugged, I followed her and was quiet the whole time. She then went with her other friends from another grade and left me and sat at their table.

Here are a few suggestions:  \n\\-Share with me your most controversial opinion.  \n\\-Tell me about the time you felt most alive.  \n\\-Or just ask me any sort of question, you'll find I have an open personality.\n\nPlease PM me if you are willing to:  \n\\-share a bit about yourself  \n\\-write longer messages too since I won't always be able to chat in real-time\n\nI'll do my best to respond to you as sincerely as possible and with the best intentions.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I really picked the wrong time to do it because it was during lunch and she was hungry. Also, half an hour is definitely not enough time to sort out an issue in any relationship (which I realize now). Since last year, I've had an issue with her lack of emotion. I feel like whenever I talk to her, she doesn't care at all. We never really hang out that much because we're both busy and she's not the kind of person to reach out and ask. Whenever I ask her if she wants to do something with me, she gives a neutral answer (\"I don't know, whatever you want to do\"). It doesn't help that we have no classes with each other at all this year and the only time we get to talk is during lunch (which I try to avoid because I don't like how hectic the environment is and I also have issues with eating).\n\nShe explained that she can't help the way she is and is more of a listener, hence why she often doesn't respond or gives passive responses (\"I don't what to say/I don't know how to help you with that\") after I talk to her. She told me that the only kinds of things that I talk to her about are school-related, stressful topics and that she can't really relate to me about them because we take different classes. I'm scared that when we head off to college, we'll grow apart and I want to reevaluate any friendships that I've made to determine if they're truly worth staying in so that I won't have to deal with the awkward process of cutting off/leaving high school friendships behind. She was very flustered that I kept asking her if she thought we would remain friends throughout college as well as other questions about whether she actually cared about me, if she wanted to continue our friendship, etc. \n\nI feel so awful and ashamed. She was planning on bringing her boyfriend to our school's football game today and subtly invited me to come and meet him (\"You're welcome to come if you want, it's up to you\"), but I decided not to since, again, I'm not a fan of being in loud, crowded spaces. I just realized that may have potentially hurt her feelings, even if she didn't express it. I feel like I really showed how needy and insecure I am as a person and that both me and my friend want more from each other in different ways. I thought I was doing the right thing by communicating how I felt, but I probably should've approached her more gently instead of going straight into the issue. \n\nI have no idea what to do from here on out. I don't know if I should give her space or if I should immediately apologize. Is our friendship ruined because of me? What's even more awkward is that other friends of mine are also going to the football game and I want to go see it with them, but that really desperate part of me wants to go meet my friend and her boyfriend so that I can show her that I still support her and to also briefly apologize before going further into detail afterwards.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I almost never ever felt 'left out' of anything when I was growing up, because honestly people would ask me to hang out with them but I'd turn it down due to being introverted and wanting to be alone because I'm happy that way. I try to be logical about most everything, so the fact that I'm feeling so insanely hurt by my friends right now is really frustrating to me because I know deep down it's just irrational...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n So...I have a best friend who I've hung out with for going on 3 years or so and I love her dearly. She has a boyfriend who I sort of helped her to get together with a couple of years ago when they first became interested in each other, and I like him a lot, but I don't have much in common with him so we don't talk often. Still, the three of us would hang out together occasionally, but mostly she and I hang out all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's where it gets complicated. My friend, her boyfriend, and I all work at the same place, and we have this co-worker who they (my friend and her boyfriend) became super close to maybe half a year ago or so. So my best friend and her boyfriend started hanging out a lot with this co-worker of ours very consistently, but this didn't bug me at all because I'd just never spoke to this particular coworker before and I knew they all seemed to get along well, so it just never really even crossed my mind at all as an issue. Then, randomly, this co-worker and I started talking more and more, both got crushes on each other, and went out like 5 times. We never officially dated, but we definitely tested the waters of dating. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring the time he and I started going out, my best friend got a little weird at one point, and when I tried to ask her what was going on, she explained that she was afraid that because I was going out with our co-worker he and I would stop hanging out with her and start only hanging out with each other, which is absolutely crazy, and I told her that would never happen, and after a few days she chilled out and we never really spoke about it again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUltimately this co-worker dude and I had a conversation about the fact that we have different religious viewpoints and we decided that was just too big of an issue to overlook, so we chose to just be friends, which sucks because we both like each other a lot still, but it just wouldn't be a good idea for us to date right now, so we stopped going out. He and I are still on very pleasant terms, though, and still talk whenever we see each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow here's the thing. My best friend, her boyfriend, and our co-worker who I semi-dated are all still really good friends, and they all work the same shifts together, they all hang out almost every single day of the week...and this never bothered me until now. We all work at the local movie theatres, and 2 weeks in a row now the three of them have come in while I'm working and they're not and have gotten tickets to go see a movie. The first time they did it they all saw me behind the counter and said 'Hi' before walking in to their movie, and that's when it struck me the most...they were all hanging out without me, and I felt really, really excluded and sad. Their movie even got out around the time I was finished with work and about to get off, so I was kind of excited and thought maybe we 4 could chat and hang out a bit, but they all just waved goodbye and then left together without chatting at all. Then they did it again exactly 1 week later, and it hurt me just as much as it did the first time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ended up going to lunch with the 4 of them this afternoon (they were going to go to lunch together and I just happened to bump in to them so I got invited to join) and I honestly felt like the awkward 4th wheel the entire time. They were all nice and sweet and stuff, but they kept talking about things that they all did together in the past and how they were planning to spend their time together over the break, but I realized they were just talking about them hanging out and not me, and at one point they even mentioned a mutual friend of all of ours and my coworker dude just said 'Hey, ya know, the 4 of us should all hang out some time.' and I realized he was talking about himself, my best friend and her boyfriend, and our mutual friend, and not me....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI dunno...I now just can't stop thinking about the fact that they're constantly spending time together, working together, going to the gym together, watching movies together, and I'm not included in it....it never bothered me until I went out with our co-worker and then we decided not to date. That's definitely the major reason I'm feeling this way, but I don't know what to do and I feel guilty for how much this is hurting me right now and how lonely it makes me feel...does anyone have any thoughts about this?

{"post_id": "e0f1ox", "created_utc": 1574496490, "title": "My best friend", "author": "cortneycloudz", "self_text": "In May of this year one of my cousins committed suicide, me being the person I am I quickly befriended the girl he was dating at his T.O.D. We were super super close, we didn't really hang out often at first but after a month or 2 our friendship really bloomed. About 2 months ago I set her up with a job at the facility I was caregiving at, shortly after she finished her training for the job her car broke down. She called me and asked if I could help her in any way, I told her I would be there soon. For the next month I continued taking her anywhere she needed to go (even after I lost my job for my disability) She put gas in my tank here and there, so I didn't really complain. Then it progressed to her asking to take my car places every. single. day. At like weird ass times... Like 2-4am. Always same thing \"oh I needa go to walmart\" or \"oh the bank for my loan\" ladeeda. So for a while I just let her, one day, before a very important appointment in a different city, my car started overheating. I hadn't driven it even 5 miles in the last week, she had it like most of the time. So I told her \"I've gotta get my car looked at, its overheating. I can't take you to work today.\" She asked me if I could find her a ride to her job... Well long story short I got the problem solved before her shift and picked her up for work and ran her wherever she wanted to go before she went in.  A couple days pass, she uses my car some more, but we had planned for her to accompany me to my important appointment reguarding my disability. The day before the appointment she texts me and tells me shes not gonna come with anymore because she needs to make appointments that day...? So I found someone else to drive with me. I was diagnosed with CVS (cyclic vomiting syndrome) if you don't know what that is, just google it or take it from me, it's fucking hell. Everyone around me is well aware of my symptoms. So flash forward a couple days,she loses her job, her loan gets approved, she gets a new car. Surprise! Today! I get a text from her asking if I can go with her to the autoshop because something in her new car is broken, I say sure and we plan to hang out all day over coffee with my grandma and each head to the auto place. We run a couple MORE tedious tasks for her, then head back to my place to chill for a bit before I have a physical at 1:30... She told me she was coming with, she left my house with another one of my family members she finds attractive at about 12:30pm. So I get home after my appointment and know she came bacl because her basket she left wasn't there anymore, I hadn't missed any texts or calls from her. I waited around for her to message me because I was honestly at a breaking point. And finally at like 8pm after I text my family member she was with earlier asking if he'd heard from her, my phone pops up with a message from her, asking if I was busy and if she can come grab something she'd left in my car. I told her I wasn't home and that I'd let her know because I'm honestly just so frustrated and feel so used. She continued to message me a half hour later saying \"when are you gonna be home\" so I texted her something that she herself had said earlier today along the lines of \"I'm done going by everyone elses schedule I'm doing whats best for me\" and she proceeded to cuss me out and yell at me for \"ghosting\" her (in quotes because my disability puts me in a state of comatose) I put my whole heart into this young woman, even helped her apply for another new job today.  But I don't think I can handle this anymore.... Am I wrong to be upset? Opinions?", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I just moved into a city that has better then satellite internet so I haven't watched anime in a while but have read a bunch of manga. Currently theory building a new pc for xmas next year. My oven just got replaced and I got to make cheesecake cupcakes but I may make some brownies later.\n\n I can talk a lot so you might need to shut me up every now and then!

{"post_id": "e0lte8", "created_utc": 1574533619, "title": "Feel like my best friend feels obligated to hang out with me rather than genuinely wanting to see me (UK)", "author": "throwaway82563880", "self_text": "Bit of a long one, sorry. Also she doesn't use Reddit but throwaway account anyway just in case. TLDR at the end!\n\nMy (25F) best friend Laura (25F, not her real name) and I have been friends since Year 3 (idk, 4th grade? We were 7). When we were kids we had things in common, we liked art, we liked the same music, we liked horsing around in the playground and we quickly became inseparable. Apart from the odd fall out at school we've been best friends ever since.\n\nHowever our friendship started to strain when I moved school for A-levels (age 16-18). She is very heterosexual, I am not. She likes popular music and going out drinking and dancing, she likes make up and fashion and prosecco. In no way am I a 'not like other girls' girl, it's just that I've never really been into that stuff and it showed at school. I've always been a tomboy, and so when I moved school we just...drifted.\n\nEventually I moved away from my hometown to Wales and we talked even less. But we were still 'best friends' and would confide in the other when we needed it. She stayed in our hometown for higher education and then got a job there, whereas I moved abroad for a year after uni. After my year abroad, I moved back to my hometown, hoping that she and I (and a couple of other friends too) could reconnect.\n\nI tried my absolute hardest. It was her birthday shortly after I moved back and even though I asked her what she was doing she avoided the question. I then saw an Instagram story where she had had a house party. I felt really hurt and decided to confront her about it. I invited her and two other friends over for dinner which I cooked myself and at some point slipped in a 'so your birthday pictures looked great! It's a shame I didn't tell you I was here' and she replied with 'yeah I didnt know you were here, sorry'. I felt even more hurt and ushered them all out of my flat quite swiftly after.\n\nSince then, in the space of a year, I can probably count on one hand the number of times I've seen her. Not only do we have different interests but we also have wildly different political views (she's a staunch Tory, I'm left-wing). At this point the feeling I get is that she only hangs out with me because she feels obligated, because we've been friends for so long. I'm not a big drinker, I don't really go out, but I said to her that I would like the odd night out just for fun. We've just...turned into the black-and-white opposite of each other and I feel like I'm trying really really hard for someone who thinks I'm cute, but not much fun.\n\nAfter a year, her birthday rolled around again. I didn't get an invite to anything, and then saw another Instagram story about her birthday celebrations. Turns out it was a housewarming party for one of her friends which doubled as her birthday party, but I thought 'it would have been nice if she'd asked her host if I could be there'. We went out for Nandos the week after, but I still felt left out.\n\nMy partner lives in the north, so I eventually got sick of my hometown in the south and moved up north to be closer to her. I told Laura I was leaving and we went for a coffee, which was nice, but the other two friends (who incidentally are getting married next year) I didn't bother to tell because despite me trying to reconnect with them all year too I didnt feel particularly valued. I don't expect to be invited to the wedding, and I'm dreading seeing the pictures of them there because I know I'm going to feel shit. But that's just something I'm going to have to get over.\n\nI guess this was more of a rant than anything else. I'm just not sure what to do from here. I get the impression that I'm the 'annoying' friend and to be honest, I'm glad I'm out of my hometown so that I don't have to try so hard.\n\nAnyway if you've read all this far then you're a star, thank you. And if you have any insight that might help me, it would be very much appreciated. Also if you think I'm being a super jerk please tell me so I can stop\n\nTLDR: Best friend of nearly 20 years and I have drifted apart, and now I feel like a spare friend who she hangs out with out of obligation", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We built a friendship that I thought was going to be long lasting. We even threw the label of \"best friends\" on ourselves. At this point, I'm pretty sure this friendship has run it's course. I really just need some clarity that letting go of this friendship is best for me. So, on with it.\n\nShe has been in a relationship with another friend for 4 years next month and a few months ago, she took a test, found out she was pregnant. In the 2 years we have been friends she talked often of how my kid would be a great role model for her kid one day, and how the guy she's with is the only one she ever saw herself procreating with. She told me she was pregnant with the knowledge that I would be excited for them, but also the knowledge that she was going to kill that excitement in a matter a minutes. \nFast forward, she tells me they aren't keeping it and it was solely her decision, because her fiance was excited as well. I didn't agree with her decision, but I had no real issue with her decision. I simply told her, \"if that's what you feel best, do what you have to do. I loved you before your offspring, anyway.\" However, she quit her job last year, due to mental health, which I fully supported. Though, I was also under the impression getting away from what she claimed to be a huge source of her depression, would allow and encourage her to persue things she loved. I was wrong. Her days consisted mostly of sleeping or just ataying couped up in the house. After telling me her decision, I did tell her that if being a mother wasn't something she wanted, she needed to discuss that with her partner and do something other than play computer games and sleep all day. It sounds bad, but really, facts dont care about feelings. It was a hard truth and I tried for over a year to help her out of her funk. Me telling her that was the last conversation we had as \"best friends.\" Since, there was a Halloween get together, which was lackluster af(no other way to put it). And my husband even said she acted different. We haven't hung out in over 2 months, and when I ask what shes been up to, she'll say she's been going to her mom's or grandma's. Both who live right down the road from me; and she was prone to stopping by. I asked about the change and she always says nothing's changed on her end, but her actions say otherwise. I know this is a lot to read, but my qualm comes from her being engaged to my husband's best friend. She will be a constant as long as they're together, and I can be civil but I have no clue what to think of our friendship. If there even is one. \n\nIf anyone took the time to read this, I'd be glad to fill in details, if anyone has any advice. \n\nThanks", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I'm trying therapy and I'm doing my best, but it all still feels really hollow. I feel immense pain in my heart knowing I'll never escape my past and the hurt that was inflicted on my body will always be there, looking right back at me. My mind will never steer clear of the horrifying things it had to witness and feel, no matter how deep I repress things or how many goals I put for myself. I've watched my body being abused so many times, yet I'm just like all of them. I abuse my body as well and let others do whatever. I hate my reflection and even today, a day of celebration and joy, I still managed to ruin it by binge eating and making myself throw up. I just wish I didn't hate myself and my body this much. I have so many emotions and I don't know where to put them. \n\nI just wish I could find a release from all this pain and hurt. First I thought escaping would make me happy, but it didn't. then it was hearing again, but it didn't. I just don't know anymore, and I'm alone in this as no one really relates to a victim of kidnapping which happens to keep messing up and disappointing everyone around him.  \n\nAnyways, God bless Kate bush and Lana Del Rey music, Am I RIGHT? \n\nP.S: I'm sorry for a depressing, unclear and confusing rant. I hope I'm doing this post thing correctly.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

It was worth the hassle though, it adds so much to the    taste!*\n\n*I\u2019m    spending the weekend in a province of The Netherlands that physically    didn\u2019t exist during WWII. It was reclaimed during the 60\u2019s, and used  to   be the South Sea (cf. North Sea, which still exists to this day)*\n\n*I    bought an e-reader not too long ago, and connected it to my library    account today. I can now loan library books, which automatically become    unreadable once the loan period has passed. Pretty neat, never really    knew that was possible.*\n\nI    would love to find a friend (or some friends) to talk about random  stuff   like what I described above. Stuff I notice, stuff you notice,  stuff   that happens to either of us. I take a lot of photos of the  world around   me, so be prepared to be inundated with those. Of course  I\u2019d also love   to talk about bigger things. About what bugs us, what we  love, what   we\u2019re afraid of and what we\u2019re looking forward to. A  friend to share my   life with and who wants to share their life with  me.\n\nSo   who am I? I\u2019m 26 years  old and I\u2019m from The Netherlands. I\u2019m in the   final stages of uni, so I  spend my days studying and drinking copious   amounts of coffee. I  spend my evenings reading, driving a simulated race   car in my humble  but oh-so-fun racing simulator set-up.

I\u2019m in  therapy to deal with depression and anxiety, which is going  quite   well, bit I think it\u2019s good to be honest about that from the  start.

The story was, I go to school with her everyday and dedicated every moment with her, I comply with almost all of her wishes if it\u2019s within my capability. I even let her disturb my study because I was afraid that if I don\u2019t give her attention she\u2019d get mad. She told me before she felt left out when I hung out with other friends but don\u2019t include her, I understand that that\u2019s the root of why she feels insecure and I have to take responsibility for that. But the problem is that I periodically fail her because I don\u2019t know exactly what she wants and how \u201cmuch\u201d attention she needs, and since she is a very hot-tempered friend and she would make sure her anger shows. Every time I fail her she\u2019d accuse me of being neglecting and heartless and that she is the only one contributes to our friendship while I never did anything and being self-centered. I tried to ask her twice about how she wants to be given attention but she avoided it and told me to \u201cfigure\u201d it out. I just failed her again (sadly) because, from my perspective, is that I didn\u2019t reply her \u201cproperly\u201d. That was about a joke she always make, about how ugly and bad I am, I\u2019d normally laugh it off and jokingly redefine myself that I\u2019m actually not that bad. But I was busy with housework so all I replied was \u201coh.. D:\u201d then said I\u2019d do something else. \n\nShe also likes to play me by pretending she\u2019s angry and make me feel bad, she told me that it makes her feel \u201ccool\u201d and that\u2019s the type of model she aims to be. I feel bad for failing her so often and I wonder if I\u2019m only playing the victim because I was so tired of this and wanted to run away. I don\u2019t feel the same with her anymore now that a part of me is afraid of her. We still have a lot of good time together and overall she treats her friend pretty nicely. But to be honest I\u2019d rather spend more time with my other friends than with her. I feel irresponsible and maybe she was right, I\u2019m being neglecting. I\u2019m tired of always being wrong and I despise myself for being unaware of the needs of my friend. Sorry for the long vent.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

My name is Lezabeilles (I'll give you my real name when we start chatting), and I'm writing from the Great White North (I'm sure that every Canadian says this, so I apologize for being clich\u00e9). I'm new to the interesting, yet scary, world of Reddit; I actually joined on specifically for groups like this one. I've not had much luck finding friends in Canada's capital since I moved here (last thing I tried was Bumble BFF - liked the name - ofc, not the experience), so I thought I'd look for friends from near and far. For full disclosure, I'm gay and in a long-term relationship; hopefully, this doesn't diminish my stock too much as it seems to in other corners of the internet, but I'm a big believer in quality over quantity. If you'd prefer not to talk to me for either of those reasons, any correspondence between us probably wouldn't have been very enjoyable anyways #sorrynotsorry. De rien!\n\nSo why should you talk to me? Hmm, that's actually a really good question. I can't guarantee that having me as a friend will make you a better person or help you to discover any great mysteries of the universe, but you can bet your bottom dollar that I like to write; you'll never get cheated on messages (if you view that as an entirely good thing, please accept a Fast Pass to the beginning of the line). As a person, an INFJ person (*a real INFJ - I took the test in an internship prep class for the first time when I didn't even know what the hell all those letters meant*), I am pretty hopelessly introverted (and it's a fate that I'm resigned to and have made peace with), but if you put a pen in my hand or sit me behind a keyboard, I'll \"talk\" forever. While I'm open to voice or in-person too, I'm like a car heater: takes me a little while to warm up. I also have a wide variety of interests, such as writing, travelling, history, Disney-related stuff (saw Frozen II yesterday), reading, baseball (how 'bout them Astros?), linguistics, and taking long walks along the river. I'm hoping to get a Switch Lite in the next month, so what I plan to play with it will be TBD (any suggestions are welcome!), but I am for a fact going to get me some Pok\u00e9mon (it's the driving force behind why I want the Switch Lite in the first place). My partner and I have a regular ole Switch too, but he hogs it with his Paladin addiction, and it just won't be a good situation having only one switch when I have to spend limitless hours hatching eggs. Mais, je digress. Je peux write en mauvais fran\u00e7ais si tu would aimes \u00e7a. Fair warning though, I will be starting with a French tutor next week, so if you want to experience the extent of my cruddy French, it's a limited time offer (hopefully).\n\nI guess I'll leave it off there for now. I kind of hate writing and talking about myself, especially in the context of having to \"sell myself\" (if you were a fly on the wall during one of my job interviews, you'd probably question whether or not I'm fluent in English). I'm not very picky when it comes to people as long as you're kindly, have a personality, and preferably don't have Bubonic plague. I'll even wave the need for a CV and referees! Call it a Black Friday deal. I figured I'd just make this initial post so that it'll forever exist in this group's annals, but I'll also look through other posts on here too. I'm okay with most forms of communication. I just have to cross the line at carrier pigeons; I just don't think it's sensible. Also, my grandfather had a pigeon coop and raced them (actually) when I was little, and they always kinda freaked me out a bit. The smell was pretty awful too. Maybe that's when I first starting developing my sensitive nose. Okay, I feel like I'm rambling out this point, so I'll leave you off with a choice of questions to answer in your first DM to me:\n\n(1) What was your most convincing paranormal experience?; (2) What's your secret super power?; (3) Of ones that you own or otherwise, what's your favourite undergarment design?; (4) Which city should I visit next? Really... Convince me... I'm trying to figure it out myself xD", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

It was fun, although a girl said she thought of us as \"psychopats\". I thought: if I'm able to tell this many people about me having bipolar, then I should be able to open my heart to someone far away (or not so far away). So here I am: more open and more anxious, ready to open my heart and ready to listen.\n\nSo who am I? I'm a seventeen year old guy from Brazil. I like many things such as social sciences, history, arts, politics, literature, philosophy, cinema. I've often wanted to be many things; nowadays, I am convinced I should study Anthropology or History and should be a diplomat. Tomorrow, I might change my mind -- although I should say that while I've wanted to study Law or Political Science in the past, I've always wanted to be a diplomat.\n\nI also dabble in writing and arts; I've written some silly poems, which should remain unread, and I've helped to produce and direct some short films, which should remain unseen. I often think of following professional career in writing and cinema despite my lack of talent for both. I'm right now trying to get into Studio Ghibli movies (and I have to say I've liked the few ones I've seen so far) and trying to talk my best friend into going to watch Parasite with me.\n\nI've recently become even more fascinated by the Middle East. I plan to learn Persian, Turkish and Arabic some day and I'd love to visit all of Middle East; in fact, I've long dreamed of living in Tehran, and I've sometimes planned to go there to study Persian for a year. I wish to live in Istanbul as well -- I've been thinking of spending some time there and in Beirut in 2020 or 2021. Besides loving the Middle East, I'm also in love with many other countries, such as Argentina. Since Bolsonaro won the Presidential Election, I'm considering moving to Buenos Aires.\n\nI speak English and Portuguese and I can read Spanish fairly well. I'm learning Spanish and French, both needed for my foreign service exams, but I'm very far from being fluent at any of them -- in fact, I'm still A1 at French.\n\nI'm open to anyone, of any age, from anywhere.\n\nI'll leave you [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOVT74qDQIc) as a gift for reading everything. I love Astor Piazzolla, he's one my favourite composers.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

That post was about the group that left and I guess this one is about the people in the group that were left behind.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/bn44w5/sometimes\\_i\\_think\\_other\\_moms\\_are\\_harder\\_to\\_deal/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/bn44w5/sometimes_i_think_other_moms_are_harder_to_deal/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt took 2 months for the people in charge to notice when they asked a mutual friend where I'd been and they were surprised that I had left the group. Said friend, let's call her A, suggested they, let's call them B and C, talk to me about it.\n\nA few years ago, I met B and C in a different group that they were running. 2 or so months later they decided to dissolved the group and then created a smaller group of 6 or so people that included me. That group slowly fizzled out. They then joined another group I was part of and then gained leadership of it.\n\nMembership dropped and a lot of people felt alienated by them. They dissolved this group and created a 4th group that my very close friend kept trying to add me to on FB so I ended up joining it even though I have been keeping my distance from some of them.\n\nSometime in the middle of all of this they created their own tiny subgroup of 5 people that do things together like outings and traveling together and nobody else gets invited. So it wasn't a shock that so many people left the group. They would often talk about the fun things they did together that nobody else was invited to and not realize how off-putting it was.\n\nPeople started complaining about how B and C did things to me and I tried to brush it off for a while because at the time I considered them to be friends.\n\nIn the past 6 months, C reached out to me twice which I appreciated. I basically told her that I felt left out and like I didn't belong anymore and she apologized that I felt that way and said that both she and B cared about me. But since May B never actually reached out to me and we were at a mutual friends party. I said hi. She said bye. That was it.\n\nThe straw that broke the camels back was that at the end of the school year I was at a playdate with B and C at someone's house where there was drinking. And maybe the alcohol is why B and C were acting insensitively. B spent a lot of time talking about her daughter's party and how rude it was that people don't rsvp either yes or no and that she was chasing people down.\n\nThe prior year I was at a table with them and she started bringing up her daughter's upcoming party then looked at me and said of course you're invited too. But I never had received an invite before then or after so I never knew if I really was invited.\n\nBack to this year's party. She talked about it a lot and I tried to ignore it because I was not invited and knew I was not invited. Then C told a 4th person at the table about her daughter's upcoming party and said when and where it was and B looks at her phone and said \"how come it's not in my calendar,\" then jokingly said, \"I guess I'm not invited.\"\n\nI was sitting right between B and C and was dumbfounded. I understand that they could not invite everyone but to talk about it in front of me like that felt so rude.\n\nThen after that they started talking about their sex lives then asking me about mine. I don't mind talking about my sex life but to people who are rude and for it to be at a play date was a bit weird. It was all so bizarre to me. I left the group a week later.\n\nThe thing is that I have mutual friends with B and C that I swear have not seen this side to them. They will point out little things they do that are hypocritical or clique-y but I feel like a lot of the things they have said are just in front of me so I feel crazy.\n\nI started to go back in my mind and see a lot of moments with them in a different light. Like how 2 years ago we went on a mom's weekend trip and their sub group left the next morning without saying anything. The moms in my room asked them if they wanted to go get breakfast and it had turned out that they already went home. The whole trip it felt like B and C were trying to dodge our group, even thought C was the one who organized the trip.\n\nB and C used to make snide comments making fun of the person who created the group. They would kind of sneer at people who seemed to try too hard like moms who are very crafty or pay a lot of attention to their kids. To the point where I couldn't tell if their compliments to me were sincere or backhanded. I wondered if maybe they were making fun of me behind my back too because I can be an overeager person.\n\nOne time C said how they wish they could just have family get togethers but only with certain families and not invite the rest. And of course I never made the cut. Over a year later, why should I call them my friends?\n\nI didn't invite C to my baby's birthday and she asked one of our mutual friends why I didn't invite her and I was so surprised by that. Why do you even care? She didn't invite us to either of her kids birthdays this past year which is fine. But what are you expecting? At mutual friends birthdays B and C would manage to just say hi to me and then spend the rest of the parties talking to each other in a corner. I didn't notice until H pointed out how hard it is was to talk to them.\n\nAnyway, one of our mutual friends is trying to set up a mom's night and I think I don't want to go. Even if one of my best friends is going, I will probably have a bad time if B and C are both there.\n\nLast mom's night last year, B was complaining about her neighbor's husband and it just feels like she always talks about people like she's better than them in an \"oh isn't it said that so and so's husband is like that\" sort of way. And when it's not that, she's joking about how much of an alcoholic she is like that's a funny thing.\n\nThe mom's night before that, B and C got a little too drunk and B accidentally broke a wine glass while C referred to one of the moms that wasn't there as a \"big bitch\" loudly in front of the rest of the table. I was embarrassed to be associated with her after that.\n\nThey both basically blamed how badly the group was going on the group that left even though they had given up long before then. Then C joked about punching me if I said anything about it to the lady she was talking about.\n\nThis past summer for me was so hard. I didn't sign up for summer school because I wanted to avoid the moms in the previous post as well as B and C. I didn't know if I would lose friends over this but everything ended up okay. At the same time I don't want to seem like an asshole for not going to these things when it means missing out on seeing some other friends that I do like.\n\nI have 2 friends in that group that I do see regularly but the rest of them I will probably never really see again except for the times we run into each other around our small town. They are nice people but they are much closer to B and C. And I can't and I guess I shouldn't try, to convince any of our mutual friends that deep down I do not think B and C are nice people (even though there were good times and times that I leaned on them and that they were good to me in the past.)\n\nETA: I did tell C that I do not want there to be any bad feelings between us, but at the same time I did not say that I might not want to actually be friends with them. I guess I just want to be civil and if we run into each other at the library or a mutual friend's party, we can say hi and chat for a minute and that's it. But my interest to be friends with her or B is long gone.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

In public I sadly don't have many friends in person and most of my friends are on here from Reddit. They have been so awesome and nice and I can't thank them enough.  I was hoping I can make friends with more people like that. Don't worry about those I'm already talking with I will still talk with you. Just trying to expand my friends list. \n\nIn terms of Hobbies. My favorite stuff to do is watch movies or tv shows. Some of my favorite movies are The Dark Knight, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, and Apocalypse Now. Some of my favorite tv shows currently are Big Little Lies, The Handmaid's Tale, Black Mirror, Stranger Things, Westworld, Rick and Morty, American Horror Story, Barry and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. However I watch a lot of other movies and shows as well. I'm also big Fan of Star Wars, Game of Thrones, and Marvel. So feel free to give me suggestions on movies or shows to watch\n\nI love animals particularly Dogs and hamsters. Huskies are my favorite breed but I also love bulldogs. Sadly I don't have a dog or any pet but, would love one in the future. \n\nI'm a big WWE fan or at least try to watch what I can. Been watching since 2006. So if you like WWE that would be awesome. \n\nI love rock music from the 70s-90. My favorite bands are (AC/DC, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Guns N Roses, Kiss, Metallica, and Queen). \n\nOther things I like are to learn about history, conspiracy theories/mysteries even though I don't believe most of them, Memes, and Sports. \n\nSo yeah feel free to message me if any of these things interest you \ud83d\ude03. If you going to message me I recommend you being around my age at least 19-27. I can make some exceptions though. \n\nImportant, don't bother sending me a message if your just going to ghost. It really hurts and I don't like doing that either to others unless we don't connect or something. Also I  don't like when a conversation fizzles out and I don't ever hear from you again. It's fine if your forgot to respond but, I usually think if it fizzles out and you never get back to me. That you don't care to talk again. \n\nDon't care what gender just want friends who share interests to talk. I have Whatsapp, kik, Snapchat and, Discord but I want to keep the conversation on Reddit for now. Until we get to know each other more. I prefer the pm message box and not the chat but whatever works for you. So yeah just msg me your age, gender, and a little bit about yourself so I know you read all this lol.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I still believe in such a person. \n\nHowever, it seems the only other people who follow a similar-model to myself are those who do so due to religious-practice (I'm agnostic), those who have issues with intimacy (been to therapists; they say that isn't the case) or those simply haven't had the opportunity to get intimate with another (I've had offers). \n\nI'm here to see if there is some sort of community for people like me, or others who might feel the same way I do (i.e. reserving physical intimacy due to non-religious values). \n\nNot really here to get into a debate; just trying to find other people like myself.

{"post_id": "e17i6v", "created_utc": 1574640961, "title": "An unplanned passing-by wander of the murky bay.", "author": "WanderingBeachcomber", "self_text": "**And here it goes\u2026**\n\nShort story long. A day ago I surfed across the internet as I used to do when I need some resources for my writings or just thinkings. Very spontaneously I wanted to refresh my knowledge in Epicurus teachings about friendship, and why he insisted that it leads to true happiness. I remember very well his funny and peculiar idea of a small house with few people where they live commune life and the heart-warming example that \u201cif someone feels sad or gloomy, they can go to the kitchen, where there will always be some chap up-to-the-talk\u201d. No surprise that this concept was popular in the days and even realized across the Mediterranean sea for a brief amount of time. Yes, so, with this concept in mind I searched in Google the phrase \u201dEpicurus on the neediness (or the need of) friendship\u201d or something like that.\n\nPage by page I contented my interest in everything that Google could offer me in the first two or three search-pages; also recalled his another teaching of the barrel of the vine, but that is another story. One by one I pressed Google results when I stumbled upon on what I was thinking a forum with a discussion about that house topic.\n\nAnd I was wrong, instead of old, low-key HTML4 forum, I bumped into this place. Yeah, the Reddit or the place where I come no more 2 times a year to get a quick solution of some trivial matter. I never went further than the post of solution or advice, and I do not know why I hold such disinterest in forum participation - probably because I see it as too time-consuming to chat-up, to debate with a faceless mass of people and read or view their momentary sparkly stream of a public voice.\n\nI stumbled upon this (now I know what it is called) the \u201csubreddit\u201d. Must admit - the unfamiliarity of Reddit almost dispelled me away, but yet I spend a 3-4 second for a good scroll-down and cached up following three titles what my eyes spotlighted for me: \u201cDepressed and lonely\u201d, \u201cNeed to talk\u201d, \u201cLife is cold and dark\u201d...\n\n\u2026that was clear I have journeyed to the wrong, wrong place and here is nothing for me to catch and gain - especially for my searching topic. What happened later was rather very unlike me if I see it in a retrospective. Some strange will kept me hooked on and inspect these...these pessimistic titled posts.\n\nBut yes, there is a dread human interest for other misery and woe. Hell, I know my country\u2019s most-watched TV program is news broadcasting, where they televise the misfortunes that happened last days in the country. Who has his house burned down, who has stabbed, robed, furiously defiled - that is prime time for grandpa\u2019s and grandma\u2019s - to see human suffering and satisfy the interest of other hardship, adversity, and grief.\n\nYea, bad people, and after this spontaneous reflection\u2026I am not excluded. O'crap, I have noticed that you people like the term - platonic - then know this. The man whose name is used as a prefix for that term has illustrated, in his ancient time, people's ill interest (the same one which nastily hooked me to examine further these posts for which I am very ashamed):\n\n\"Once upon a time, I was told, and I believe that Leontius, the son of Aglaion when he was driving from Peirai to Athens, saw the dead bodies of the hangman outside the North Wall. He had both a desire to see them and, angry with himself, was about to leave. For some time he struggled, covering his face until lust finally conquered. Wide-eyed, running to the corpses, he exclaimed, \"Cursed, rejoice at how much you love this beautiful sight!\"\n\nDear reader, now you see how wretched people of my kind can be if they honestly introspect themselves. Sometimes I am suffering from this because I can track down these nasty things of a whim. Better is to not know these sources. And by the way, that fragment is from a book called \"The Republic\" and the author is discussing the principle of \"ID\" and \"Super-ego\", but let's not delve any deeper. But I can bet that some individuals are lurking here daily because they cannot satisfy this strange interest.\n\nVast billboard of posts was before me - full of words like depression, anxiety, loneliness, sadness, introversion, and whatnot, that I was under the impression, that this, yeah, for sure, this could be a real-like limbo or a sad, grey place - the murky bay.\n\nThen things started to turn very gloomy when I encountered stories of horrific personal life-disasters. I do not know how those posts are ordering themselves, but what started with rough, unpleasant weekday office frustration ended with shocking catastrophes. But as the hardness and dismal was growing - the shame of such noxious interest did not lag behind.\n\nAfter 3 hours of meticulous cruising trough what I could reach - I finally got back a sense of self-control and turned me away with a blank stare. Okay, I said, that was one hell an internet session. As an individual who never spends his time in internet public places, prefer to communicate in real life and comes to the web only for streaming-services, online-dictionaries, archives - all this, the concept of this subreddit, the people's candor of telling their setbacks was something for me to experience. Yes, I am most casual internet surfer and how could I know that below my surfing waves exist such vivid worlds.\n\nEducation did not seize there - a whole new unheard terminology unraveled. Like the \"small-talk\", \"ghosting\" and \"creeping\u201d (the last one I initially was interpreting in a traditional way, not in\u2026). It is good that there is an urban-dictionary for left-behinds like me.\n\nIt should be very amusing or almost unbelievable to see such a newbie telling his first impressions, but that is the bane of one who is estranged from this vast world of internet. One could think - \u201cO\u2019God, such dumb exploration and childish amazement of soil, which is nor unavailable, nor secretive, but open for everyone. If this dummy is impressed by this basic and peaceful subreddit, what he will do if one day he will accidentally click on 4Ch\u2026.(I do not know if I can mention it here) or go even deeper? \u201c Yes, one day, solely for educational purposes, I should travel there and write a long post of my impress - just to bother-up people.\n\nSo, finally, I cannot just go away that simply. \u201dOh, such hardship and gloominess, I should be on my\u201c. Why shouldn't I give my penny in the name of the common good and not give a talk for someone who is up for one?\n\nBut I must presume, that after my water-full and yada yada yada long post, there is no one left. They all have left after that Epicurus paragraph and it will be bliss for me if one will bother to write \u201cFuck you, man, and your long-ass essay. Just fuck it! Didn't you know that long texts are making people nervous?\u201d.\n\nKnowing that there is no one left I can write here just the same as writing my local word file. No one will read it, no one will bustle for that, and I can just go one and write it like some personal diary. Hell, why shouldn't I put \u201cLorem Ipsum\u201d as a sign of my confidence that no one is here - in this very sentence.\n\n\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.\"\n\nBut there is one entity left with me and I think that is that filtering bot, which is checking posts for malicious content and him I am offering my friendship. Following this subreddits tradition here are my quick facts and my interpretation of myself.\n\n**About me:** I think I am dumb, but that could be seen for my writing. I have less and less sense of what I sense. Back in my 16th, everything was so simple. Who is right, who is wrong, what is the truth, what is lies. Such clearance I have lost and still losing it. I did know that I was right and you were not. But now I struggle to answer what is a \u201c**right**\u201d. Obviously, it is just a \u201cturn\u201d, like to the right or to the left - what else it could be?\n\n**Interests:** I am dedicating myself to two things; without contributing daily in them I feel that a day has been wasted and spent worthlessly. That is book reading and writing. The last books that I have read were Albert Camus \u201cThe Stranger\u201d and \u201cThe Plague\u201d, Fyodor Dostoyevsky \u201cNotes from Underground\u201d and now I am finishing his \u201cNotes from the House of Dead\u201d. The next book what I will read is Kazuo Ishiguro \u201cRemains of the Day\u201d. Besides that, I force myself to write very heavy tractates in the field of gnoseology and after 4 years I decided to leave it for cool down for a couple of years and now I am working on fictitious and easer projects. I should probably not mention that like most I tend to listen to music and watch, for example, Netflix. But I am more fan of films and favorite ones are \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\u201d, \u201dAmerican Beauty\u201c, \u201cA Clockwork Orange\u201c, \u201dPain and Glory\u201c, \u201cCall Me by Your Name\u201d and \u201cEnglish Patient\u201d.\n\n**(Those flashbacks of writing CV's interest section are real)**\n\n**Gaming:** Before my dedication, I was an addict of PC master race gaming. Oh, Christ, empty soul, red eyes, sweaty t-shirt, and overheated PC - those were good days. I have sacrificed all that for the greater good because I feel I could spend all my life and I still would not reach satiety. CS-GO, HOTS Civ5-6, Skyrim - all of them 1500+, without other countless SP games. My thirst was abnormal and only with the time I felt hurtful emptiness after 15 long gaming sessions that led me to discard this hobby. Nowadays I tend to play some single-player games (The Long Dark, Danganronpa, The Banner Saga), but in very small portions and occasionally jump into EU:4, HOF:4, I:R - in those niche studio paradox grand strategy games. So, no Apex Legends, no Fortnite, no Overwatch, no PUBG, no LoL - also I think I am too old for gaming and if I could I would exchange all my wasted hours to learn a language, like Spanish, which I freely study. Days Gone.\n\n**What else?:** Hmm, books, writing, and language studying with recreation in between are my triangle. Everything else is secondary and it means a little, e.g., that every 2 or 3 months when my need of sense and reason is exceeding the norms I watch one season of anime, read a cheap Polish or Belarusian fiction novel or go to the ranch to stare on farms livestock life and contemplate - how good it would be if my awareness would be equal to this sheep ones.\n\n**Essential:** I am \\[21M\\] (oh yeah, the 21M and not 21-year-old male) yes, unfortunately, not \\[F\\], even my couple hours gave me notice that one \\[F\\] in this subreddit pawnshop is worth 7 \\[M\\]'s. From Europa. English is my third language and that could be seen. \\[I edited this \"Essential\" part because said that I love to eat licorice and also that I am furious Calvinism adherent - that was too personal, so it is better to not say such sensitive things.\\]\n\nI would write what interests me (like only metalheads), but that would be a violation of my confidence that no one is reading this.\n\nI think that even that filtering bot will not tolerate how long I have made this post. My spontaneous visit to this bay has educated me some terminology, showed some unseen clingings to values like social closure, friendship, and need for such simple but important thing like - the talk. Even remember some wicked parts of the mine. And finally, I have made a Reddit profile. I am sure that this subreddit has answered my initial question better that Epicurus could answer - such bizarre and unexpected mouse click.\n\nAll this is a good example of how to write \u201cup for a talk and to be a friend\u201d and turn away people; this extensiveness, this estrangement and pesky tone of mine\u2026\n\nBut I think people in these subreddits should practice writing fluffy texts to immune themselves from those \u201cghosters\u201d because one who permits to throw up a friendship with the ease of vanishing would never bother to read such lengthy scribing. That is too hard for them.\n\nAnd here I will stop, I have passed my little story, impression, and reflection. Also, I offered a talk and I hope that bot will not refuse because I think I always got along with those primitive web chatbots back in 2010 in my primary school. The last thing - I must apologize \"to myself for myself\" for being somewhat judgmental and offensive, but the first job that I got was the earth salting.\n\nGood night.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

This study will investigate what kind of person Benjamin is and why he is a good candidate to be your friend. The paper will detail the history of Benjamin, including by not limited to, where he was born, his childhood, his life before college. This study will also explore all the things that make Benjamin the person he is, including, personality, interests and hobbies. The study will also outline the people that Benjamin is looking for. At the end, all this information will be brought together in a short summary in the conclusion.\n\n# Introduction\n\nHello. As you may have already deduced from reading or skimming over the abstract, I am in fact Benjamin, but you can call me Ben. Why am I doing this in this format? Well, one, it\u2019s to be unique and stand out. Second, I enjoy writing. My full name is Benjamin Fei, I am a 21 year old Asian male who is currently residing in Colorado. I go to university in Colorado and study Applied Computing Technology. I am 6\u2019 0\u201d, I have black hair, I wear Harry Potter looking glasses.\n\n# The History of Ben\n\nI was born in Kunming, China. My parents and I moved to Colorado when I was around age 4-5, my grandparents had already set up their lives in America prior, as that was the reason for our move. For my elementary years, I only had a handful of friends as I was a weird and nerdy foreigner. I met my best friend around this time as well, he was my next door neighbor and went to the same elementary school as me. Him and I had tons of fun together and he really helped me settle into America.\n\nFast forward to middle school and high school, this is around the time where I finally found my group of friends that I am still friends with to this day! Middle school and high school was still a weird time for me as I was maturing and trying to fit in with the masses. However, towards the latter half of high school I was able to identify the person that I want to be.\n\nSkip to my college career. I entered into my current university as an Electrical Engineer but after the first year, I realized that this was not the path I wanted to go down. Much to my parent\u2019s disappoint I decided to change my major in my second year. I am currently in my first semester of my third year.\n\n# Personality Traits and Overview\n\nMy personality traits include but not limited to:\n\n\\- Honest\n\n\\- Direct\n\n\\- Responsible\n\n\\- Funny\n\n\\- Calm\n\n\\- Imaginative\n\n\\- Social\n\n\\- Stubborn\n\n\\- Insensitive\n\n\\- Judgmental (mainly towards myself)\n\nAlthough these are just some of the traits that I present, the ones that most present are honesty and judgmental.\n\n# Interests/Hobbies\n\nRather than this be a very convoluted series of paragraphs, I will use bullet points.\n\n* **Basketball**\n   * Playing and watching.\n   * Favorite NBA team: L.A. Lakers.\n* **Soccer**\n* **Skateboarding**\n   * Just the activity, not super into skater culture.\n* **Video games**\n   * PC gaming mostly.\n   * Mainly multiplayer games.\n   * Favorite game: League of Legends.\n* **Biking**\n* **Listening to music**\n   * Mainly Hip-Hop but still love other genres.\n   * Favorite artists: Kid Cudi and Frank Ocean.\n* **Drawing**\n   * Mainly cartoons.\n* **Writing**\n* **Reading**\n   * Favorite book: A Song of Ice and Fire.\n   * Read mangas as well.\n* **Anime**\n   * I\u2019m a big weeb.\n   * Favorite Anime: Naruto.\n* **Watching YouTube**\n* **Cooking**\n   * I\u2019m not Gordon Ramsay by any standard but I be whipping in the kitchen.\n* **Talking to new people**.\n   * I find it interesting learning about new people.\n* **Science**\n   * Specifically, anything about revolving around biology.\n   * Still enjoy other fields of science.\n* **Technology**\n* **Computers**\n   * Hardware and software.\n* **World news**\n   * I like to know what\u2019s going on, on the planet I live on.\n* **Sneakers**\n   * I may or may not be addicted to sneakers.\n* **Fashion**\n* **Movies**\n   * My favorite genre is horror or thriller.\n* **DC and Marvel Universe**\n   * DC &gt; Marvel though.\n* **Photography**\n* **Memes**\n* **Card Tricks**\n* **Streaming on Twitch**\n\nAs to not bog down this section, I\u2019ll leave it at this.\n\n# People Perspective\n\nI\u2019m looking to converse with everyone! Gender doesn\u2019t matter, I love hearing about the different thoughts and stories of people of all genders or gender-less. I also enjoy chatting with people of different ages and cultures. It helps me experience things that I haven\u2019t experienced before and I find all that information absolutely fascinating.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nFirst, I\u2019d like to offer a thank you to all the took the time to look at my post, even the people that skimmed over it. I appreciate you taking your time to take a look at my post. As detailed in the post, I\u2019m Ben. I\u2019m from China, I\u2019m 21 and a pretty fun guy to talk to (I think). I have many hobbies and interests and even more that I didn\u2019t list, so we\u2019re bound to have something in common! I\u2019m open to meeting people of all kinds, regardless of gender, location, age, etc. I hope I have peaked some of your interests, if I did, don\u2019t be shy and shoot me a message! I promise I don\u2019t bite.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit 1: Grammar.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

You should always be trying to give more than you take.\n\nRight now I'm just a stranger to you and I can give you all the advice in the world but you probably won't listen to it because you don't know me.

She's been there for me through some of the worst times as I've been there for her. It's hard bc I'm so afraid of conditional love. Due to my parents. Questioning people's intentions and at the same time feeling like I dont deserve to be loved at times. Bc I can be selfish in the midst of being in pain. Struggling to just simply ask for physical affection and reassurance. It's hard to see through a cloud of negative thoughts and being able to recover and regain your self worth. \n\nBut recently and this has happened before, I've become familiar with being jealous. My best friend has another bestfriend (let's just call her Jess). And Jess is very extroverted, talks to almost everyone, funny and I just feel like I cant compete. Not that I feel the need to. I am who I am. Like my bestfriend could really live without me if she wanted to. I'm so afraid of losing her and not being important. As stupid and selfish as that sounds. Being like a backup bestfriend. I think they hangout more often but I cant really drive yet. Like it's not that I wonder why I'm not invited when they hangout, it's why dosnt she want to hangout with me? Maybe it's my own expectations bc my first thought when I see theres something fun to do is to ask her. We still hangout and stuff but like.. I dont know.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Should I be offended?\n\nMy friend and I planned a trip to meet up together on New York and I was really excited because we are very similar and get along really well. Plus before that, I had been feeling kinda lonely and unappreciated because alot of my friends never respond to my texts but when I\u2019m hanging out with them they\u2019re ALWAYS on their phones either texting someone or browsing Instagram. And this girl I met up with has the same value as me that nobody really lives in the moment and everyone\u2019s so attached to their cellphone. It was a shared pet peeve we had. Expect this whole weekend she\u2019s been on her phone! We went to two concerts together and she was on her phone the whole time at both shows. Even during the day. She\u2019ll be on her phone texting someone. We also decided to trip acid together and she called her friend while we were in the middle of trying to find the directions to the place. She was stressed about getting to the concert on time but when I tried to ask her to help me with directions she\u2019d be like \u201cwait! You\u2019re distracting me from talking on the phone!\u201d And then two minutes later she\u2019d be like omg how do we get to the venue do you know where to go?\u201d And it was like that the whole weekend. She\u2019d be on her phone, I tried to converse with her or ask her questions and she would be on her phone but then all of the sudden she\u2019d be like \u201cwhere are we?\u201d \u201cHow do we get to this place?\u201d And rely on me for directions or something. Should I be taking this personally? I can\u2019t tell if this is actually a problem or I\u2019m overreacting. But it pissed me off. Also she was on her phone for the last few hours we had together and wouldn\u2019t talk to me. If I asked her a question she\u2019d give me short answers like \u201cyeah\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. Is this something I should talk to her about? Or just let it go? I mean it\u2019s not unreasonably to want to have a detailed conversation with a friend while you\u2019re hanging out with them right? Even if it\u2019s small talk?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

At the start of 2018, my best friend and I were alone with no friendship group at school. My BFF was friends with a person who invited us to join her group. Skip to August 2019, my best friend dumps me for a crowd I didn't like (I posted about this before and got a lot of help from here &lt;3), leaving me hurt but I've gotten over it now.\n\nWhen my former BFF was in the group, we always had  separate conversations from the group, I felt a little bad for not involving myself within my group. I later learned that my best friend didn\u2019t really like my group.\n\n**Info about my group**: They're nice/inclusive/welcoming (I'm very thankful that they included me and my BFF a year ago). Also, they're loud at times (not the scene for me, an introvert), big (around 12) and childish at times (it\u2019s a harsh word, but what I mean to say is they can be really noisy at times and more \u2018playful\u2019 than \u2018chatty\u2019, opposite to me).\n\n**My position in the group**:\n\n* I\u2019m not particularly close with any of the girls in my group, they all keep in contact online, but not me -  I haven\u2019t become close to any of them really. The only person I'm close in the group is a new girl (I'll call her Betty). I'm in the peripheral of my group, as well as Betty since she's newer. It also doesn't help that I don't have that many common interests with the people in my group. *I know that if I was sick one day for example, I wouldn't be sorely missed on that sick day - everyone already has their company.*\n* In class, I don't really talk with the girls in my group - it's a bit of an awkward silence as we're not close and don't really have anything to chat about. *However*, in my classes without the people in my group, I find myself talking with others people and enjoying their company.\n\n**Current situation**: I\u2019ve recently felt out of place in my group. At recess/lunch, I don\u2019t find myself talking very much - it's noisy in the cafeteria so I don\u2019t talk much in conversations (which are usually short anyway), and so I sit in silence trying to find my way into a conversation unless I'm talking with Betty - but even then, we don't know each other extremely well so there can be pauses in our chats.\n\nIn the cafeteria I see all other groups enjoying each other\u2019s company, and I think I envy it.\n\nI\u2019m introverted, not a very confrontational person and I don\u2019t want to hurt my friends (although I think my absence wouldn't really be devastating for my group). Two people I liked in the group left a few months ago, making me feel less positive about my situation. The only person I think I would miss is Betty, and I really still want to be friends with her. She's the closest friend I have.\n\nAs previously mentioned, I enjoy spending time with girls in class who aren't part of my group, and as of late I\u2019m begging to think I envy their social groups.\n\n**My question**: I have one year left of school - should I switch groups or stick it out for one more year?\n\n**TL;DR**: I'm on the peripheral of my high school friendship group and don't feel like I really fit in. I enjoy the company of other people in class and feel more compatible with them. I'm asking for your advice on whether I should stick with my group or search for a new group to join.\n\n*I\u2019m sorry this is so long, but I would really appreciate your thoughts on my situation.

I'm a gamer and a voiceover artist, although I haven't made it big yet, but that is the goal. I have GAD and I'm pretty open about it. I love classic Simpsons, South Park, Futurama, Always Sunny, lots of stuff. Generally nerdy. Irish. \n\nI have the most incredible husband who is my best friend. He works in tech and loves to dress like a pirate occasionally. He is my everything and the kindest person I know. We are both sort of aching for good, trustworthy friends who wouldn't mind hanging out with us on a Friday or Saturday night playing games and having drinks. We're good people. Oh, and we have one cat. Big animal lovers.\n\nAnywho, if any of this sounds appealing, feel free to give me a shout here. We are based in Hayward. Thanks guys n' dolls \u2764", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I do what my husband suggests and try to have my hair done well, eyebrows, nails, dress nice so that I fit in more with other women but I never feel a connection. I got married at 24 which I think makes some people my age see me differently (I do not regret this and I love my husband) In the past people the same race as me have called me stuck up.

My friend, lets call them Michelle had recently started a long distance open relationship with her boyfriend and whined about how she wanted a girlfriend and my other friend, Lyn had started to do the same. The both of them seemed perfect for each other and well, they are. Lyn would get excited learning about Michelles slight jealousy, little things like that, but, Michelle being in an open relationship took it upon herself to be seeing several people at once. She planned a trip out to America then cancelled it, tossed between lying to her boyfriend about it, and then wanting to break up with him, started another relationship with a close friend of theirs. Lyn confieded in me saying how she liked one person and Michelle would always kiss her infront of this person, all within the process of Michelle seeing all these other people, she understood its an open relationship, but, lyn didn't feel comfortable or see the point in why she had to assert they were seeing eachother infront of a person that Lyn liked.  Michelle hasn't stopped doing this. Within all of this ive been a confident for Lyn, not really talking to Michelle about her bs. Last Thursday, Lyn was driving me to my partners house from work, and I questioned about how things were going with Michelle, and she mentioned about how she was considering ending it with them and going their separate ways, I understood this finding out how Michelle had been talking behind lyns back and calling her degrading titles. This pissed me off. Over dinner with me, my partner, and Lyn I also learned that Michelle was talking to lyn and said something along the lines of \"wishing she met Lyn before me, so she didnt have to deal with my attachment issues.\" Ive known Michelle for 4 years and Lyn for 3 learning Michelle would degrade something so damn personal was honestly heart breking to learn, and mentioned how it wasnt okay to put down that, considering its something she knows I feel really bad about. Coming monday I refused to talk to Michelle and still do right now, but I am getting a bit fustrated that, Lyn continues to feed into the relationship that she isn't happy with. \n\nI don't see Lyn as any better then Michelle since she's continuing to put up with cruel behavior from her. It's kinda pissing me off, because not only has Michelle talked badly about me, shes talked badly about Lyn too! I dont know if I should distance myself from Lyn or not, shes always around Michelle which is something im not putting up with anymore, ill be friendly etc, but I really can't find it in me to want to deal with her anymore.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I love to talk about why a game makes us feel in a certain way, what good techniques for implementing inventories are, about experimental games (Extra Credits' \"Games you might not have tried\" are a great source for that!), about how games affect culture and society etc.  \nGame design in general.  \nYou see, I am invested in games as a whole - a means for pleasure, a means for work, a means to learn, a means to grow and hope to meet someone who is a little like this too!  \nI also own an Oculus Quest.\n\nFurthermore, I love anime and will potentially continue to do so until I die, it only increased over the years. I watch seasonal stuff and old stuff and a lot and I would love to rave with you about e.g. Vinland Saga, Banana Fish, Kaguya-Sama, Beastars etc. From shows I liked I sometimes continue to read the manga or light novel, currently e.g. Demon Slayer.  \nI do enjoy non-animated serials too, though not as much.\n\nI cannot draw, though I try to learn. I cannot play a musical instrument, though I try to learn (currently the harmonica, I do have a guitar too...).\nBoth of these things I try to learn for _years_ so there's that.\n\nA great way to get to know each other would be to play a co-op game together! Or at least, I think it would be x).  \nI thought maybe about \"Divinity: Orignal Sin\", \"Tales of Berseria\" (should be possible with Steam Remote Play Together), \"Star Wars: The Old Republic\", \"Final Fantasy XIV\", \"Dark Souls III\", \"Moon Hunters\" or anything you can suggest.\n\nMy time zone is CET/GMT+1/UTC+1.\n\nWith 27 I feel quite old so I would prefer to get to know someone who is not just starting out with university or living alone for the first time.  \nThat being said, not age is the most important part, but maturity: I look for someone who has already some life experience and who understands that even though games and anime are the main hobbies, there is a RL too which sometimes needs more attention and needs to be talked about.  \nI am also looking specifically for someone to chat/converse to on a regular basis - although I am not the best at instant replying. However, I try to better myself.\n\nI am looking forward to getting a PM from you if you think we could have fun together =)!\n\nLast but not least, here are some favourites games (and animes and manga) of mine, to give ya a better picture (not sorted):\n\n- Legend of Heroes Franchise &lt;3&lt;3\n- YS\n- Persona 5 / 4 / 3 &lt;3\n- Mahou Shoujo Madoka &lt;3 &lt;3\n- Durarara\n- Utawarerumono\n- Mass Effect &lt;3\n- Dragon Age: Origins\n- Tales of Berseria/Xillia\n- Final Fantasy VII/X/X-2\n- Life is Strange\n- ShieldBro\n- Tales from the Borderlands\n- The Witcher\n- Baldurs Gate 1 + 2\n- Divinity II\n- Erased\n- Dragon's Dogma\n- Fate\n- Rascal does not dream of Bunny-Girl senpai\n- Steins;Gate\n- ReLife\n- Overlord\n- KOTOR 1 + 2\n- Vampires: The Masquerade: Bloodlines\n- Enderal\n- Phoenix Wright\n- Danganronpa (all, not gonna _lie_...)\n- Zero Escape Franchise\n- Pokemon X/Y (currently playing Sword)\n- Xenoblade Chronicles 1 + 2 (had to skip X because of no WiiU) &lt;3 &lt;3\n- Dark Souls\n- Bloodborne &lt;3 &lt;3\n- Sekiro &lt;3\n- Horizon: Zero Dawn\n....and much more.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Here's this:\n\n\nSo basically there's this girl that has joined my class about 4 months ago and we have been inseparable since the day that she has come to my school. I invited her to sit at my table for the day as she seemed kinda lonely having no friends and being in a new environment. We clicked really fast and discovered we have A LOT in common. We never stopped talking and hanging out and we even got to the point where she would invite me to hang at her home almost every day.\u00a0\n\n\nBut recently things have been changing. I feel like I'm just a side hobby and she talks to me whenever she's just bored and wants to have some fun. I'm heartbroken as I thought that we were gonna be like those close best friends that people wish to have.\n\n\nA month ago things suddenly changed between us and she keeps switching people that she talks to. By that, I mean having someone that she talks to non-stop for a day and she moves on the next day completely ignoring the person she talked to the day before. And I don't think I am the only person sad about this, but I am most definitely the saddest about it. She has had lots of people she talks to over the past month. I mean I understand that she is new and she wants to make friends but completely ignoring someone is just plain rude. By ignoring I mean not exchanging even a single word with the other person and if the person she talked to the day before tells her something she's just like \"oh yeah, cool\" and continues to talk to the person she chooses to talk to the s day.\n\n\nI have tried ignoring her about twice (both lasted for a day or two) but I don't think she even noticed. I have also tried to talk to her about it but I just can't find the perfect time and the courage to come up to her and do it.\n\n\nYesterday she started talking to me again and I thought that this would be the end of her 'phase' and she would talk to me normally again. But no today was the exact same as the past month, she ignores me and doesn't even look at me for the whole day.\u00a0\n\n\nHelp me please, I have no idea how to approach her with this and I'm sure she would think I'm desperate to be her friend", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Same personality, same interests .. everything was fine.\n\nA few months later I introduced him to other co workers. He started becoming friends with this girl (who was working at our company), but he was not really super close with her. Then I built a real friendship with him, we would hang out after work. He would even text me at night because he was suffering from insomnia just like I did.  We would talk about politics, personal stuff etc..I realized he truly liked me as  a friend, which I really appreciated. The first guy who didn\u2019t have romantic feelings for me. \n\nWell things changed, this girl at work proposed to hang out after work .. I am not a big drinker and they started talking about sex and drinking, which is fine but it was the only topic they were talking about. \n\nI started to get bored and I ignored how empty and awful I felt when I was hanging out with them. She proposed going for drinks \u2026 and he always looked at me and convinced me to go with them. \n\nHe later confessed me that she is only a good buddy to drink with but not really a friend. I believed him.\n\nSuddenly he started treating me differently. Not in a good or bad way , just completely different from what I am used to.\n\nHe started teasing me a lot. I mean everything I said was a joke, he even noticed changes in my appearance and made annoying comments. One day I was at the drugstore and he looked at my face and whipped off my highlighter on my nose.  He started touching me and crossed boundaries. These weren\u2019t sexual touches, but they somehow lingered and I felt kinda weird. At first I thought he developed feelings for me, but HE ALWAYS mentions how much he appreciates our friendship.\n\nI started to feel extremely empty when I was hanging out with him. He was soo kind to everyone but treated me differently. The teasing got too extreme, he made fun of everything  I said and I felt like he is disrespecting me. \n\nOne day he told me the girl at work, who only likes to talk about sex and drinking is just like rice. I was very confused about that statement. It didn\u2019t make sense to me. He argued .. how boring rice is and that there are only a few times where rice tastes good. He tried to explain that she is a nice person but that\u2019s  pretty much it. He even said that he has a hard time talking to her, because he has not idea what he should talk with her. I agreed and said that\u2019s how I feel about her too. Us three would sit together at work and I would feel so lonely and empty. He laughed , he joked with her.. and I was sitting at work wondering why I am so bored and lonely when I hang out with them.\n\nA few weeks later he noticed how quiet and sad I looked and I said I am not happy when I am hangig out with them.\n\nSo we hung out together in private and he started teasing me again to another extreme. He again, pointed out my looks and it started  to annoy me. \n\nI wanna understand why he behaves this way ?  he says there is nothing more than friendship. ( I don\u2019t  have romantic feelings at all I JUST WANNA UNDERSTAND HIS BEHAVIOR).I  tried to talk with him about his weird behavior but he always talks me over.\n\nHe is a honest guy, but I have this weird feeling that he is lying to me.\n\nAm I overreacting?\n\nOh btw sorry for my bad English.

They give me a excitement when I watch videos of her, her songs are catchy as well.\n\n\u2022I love plushies, I have a couple of plushies with me still. I don't went I will give them away or something like that but I'll when the right time comes for me.\n\n\u2022Lastly, I love spring, it's just great to see all the flowers blooming in the sunshine. I'm a Spring child after all, Go Aries!\n\nIf you would like to talk to me, then you can pm if you want to. Bye, stay Determined!(P.s. I also love to roleplay which I would glad to rp with you if you like rp too.)", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

The supervisor there was like the male version of me. We hit it off, became close friends. He has issues which were clear, but the majority of the time was a good time and I really enjoyed his company.\n\nI moved home in May after I graduated. Had some goodbye drinks with our close friendship group because most of us were moving back home. I had enough money to pop back to the city to see him, to hang out. We decided on Frozen 2 and the pub. \n\nBut when I arrived- he was different. All his old quality's like manipulating younger teenagers into doing stuff (like he did at work) were back. He had been used to asking for something and them handing it over. I used to work with him, so would challenge him and tell them not to hand over there Netflix account! He backed down on that sorta crap for a while.\n\n\"Can you clean the dishes in the sink as I'm giving you a free room for the night?\"\n\n\"Can you empty the bin?\"\n\n\"Can you lend me 10 quid for the petrol?\"\n\nWhat?! Do I look like your maid to you? You invited me round as a guest. Very simply no. I haven't even had a cup of tea yet. We are driving 3 minutes into town for a movie- you can monies for the parking but that it!\n\n\\^ All of those were within a few hours of arriving at his house.\n\n\"Oh I'm so used to asking \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ and \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, you see they just do it in return for coming round!\"\n\nThen he had a rant about how lonely his been since the group disbanded and how he needs social interaction. He one of those that needs to be liked and needs people to laugh at his jokes. Because none of our old group come to see him anymore after coming down to visit a few weeks ago.\n\nI told him I don't \"owe\" him for just enjoying his company. That he knows that I can't be peer pressured or manipulated into anything. And he went off into a huff.\n\nThen the next day he spontaneously booked ice skating! I'm still recovering from a broken foot, which he was aware about and hate ice skating which he knew. In our three year friendship I never said yes to going skating. But because he wanted to do it because last year he went skating with his ex and he wanted to go to \"get over her\".\n\nI was frustrated the whole time, he did what he wanted and ignored all my opinions and advice. \n\nThere's too many issues there, too much rude behavior for me to consider saving this relationship. I have plenty of friends to spend my spare time with, that live closer, even further but worth more to me now. When communicating with my old group, they all agreed on the same issues when they went down to see him. He even tried to get one of the girls to sleep in the same bed as him! So they all individually cut him off.\n\nIt's a shame because last year I was saying I wish I met him in college because I considered him my first best friend.\n\nI'm just sad about it.

{"post_id": "e2gh7i", "created_utc": 1574863660, "title": "Slowly removing myself from my high school friends", "author": "a_jordan59", "self_text": "  \n\nA little about me. 28y F, accountant, married with one dog. My two best friends and I have been friends for 13 years. We had a lot of laughs and was there for each other mentally. We will call them Abby(30) and Candise(28). I would say for the past 4 years I have been getting frustrated with both of them. For one we no longer have anything in common. Abby never changed in a bad way. She always wanted to fight in high school if someone looked at her sideways and still does \u201cEven though she never did and I think she was and still is all talk\u201d. Right now she is in a dead in relationship with a guy who has no job, no license, no car and no ambition. He sent cash app to a random girl to get nude photos and she called crying to both me and Candise about it. We gave her advice on how she needs to leave him. They're not married, they don\u2019t have kids and he brings nothing to the table. She says that we were right but then still ended up staying with him. She is constantly struggling and asking me for money. I think in total I have lent her over $1200 over the past 4 years and I have yet to see any of it back. She will say \u201cCan I have $80 till the 3rd.\u201d I always said yes because my family always struggled and it was hard so I knew what it felt like. But after a while I noticed she wasn\u2019t doing anything to better her situation. She always talked about these plans on what she wanted to do and that she wanted to open up a bakery. She wanted me to help her come up with a budget. \n\nNow I enjoy creating budgets and giving people financial advice. It\u2019s something I\u2019m very passionate about. I want to help people find multiple ways out of debt and holes and start over. So I didn\u2019t hesitate. I spent weeks butting together a plan, researching the market, prices and what she needed to do to get started. I presented this to her and she was happy. I asked her when did she want to get started. She said \u201cnow\u201d I gave her a timeline on what to do. I even gave her a budget on her personal expenses so that she could afford to get things going. She did nothing. This was 3 years ago and she hasn\u2019t mentioned it since. Then she talked about going back to school for nursing. Candise and I both encouraged her sent her different programs. Nothing. Yet she complains everyday about struggling and paying bills and asking me for money. I stopped giving her money and as soon as I did that she stopped calling me and texting \u201cJust to check on me\u201d she only responds in the group chat which I will get to later.\n\nCandise is a med student. She lives in a bad situation with her dad. He\u2019s constantly shaming her for everything she does and doesn\u2019t support her for going to medical school. Candise has a bachelors and masters degree. Technically she can get a decent full time job and live on her own to get out of her toxic situation but she doesn\u2019t want to because she said she needs more time to study for clinicals so she decided to stay with her dad. Which I get. But here is where it gets annoying. She needs medical insurance because she has a medical condition that requires her to get medications every month which are not cheap. Her part time jobs does not offer it. She is also in mounds of student loan debt so she has to pay those off. She also has maxed out her credit cards which she has to pay that. So all these bills and she only has a part time job that does not pay that much. She has the potential to get a job that pays way more and live comfortably. Now I get that she needs time to study I totally understand. But her dad is the definition of a dick. He is verbally abusive, toxic, narcissist the list goes on. He also has the money to help her and refuses to. She asked for money to get her meds and he refused he told her to get a job. She could literally die without this medication. She also does not have a car which makes things difficult for her to get around.\n\nI sat her down and had a conversation with her and said \u201cI think you should consider moving out your dads house. I think you should find a full time job and take your time getting into clinicals. The only reason you are rushing is because you want to leave your dad. Once you get in a better environment, you will feel 10 times better. I\u2019m not saying give up on clinicals, I\u2019m saying put your mental health first. The first thing you should do when you get the full time job is save money for a car. It doesn\u2019t have to be expensive just something to get you around in.\u201d She tells me moving out will cost money and she might not be able to live on her own and she doesn\u2019t want to live with a roommate because she wants to be by herself. She said she won\u2019t need a car because when she goes up north to clinicals she won\u2019t have a place to park it. The issue with this statement is that she won\u2019t ever have the money to move up north because literally every cent she makes goes into paying her student loans with that part time job. So she isn\u2019t saving money at all. It\u2019s been a year and she\u2019s not even close.\n\nMeanwhile in our group chat they both talk about wanting to travel the world, start their own business and be financially free. They both say when we all get established with good jobs and money we going on a girls trip. The thing is I\u2019m already traveling the world with my husband, I\u2019m not struggling like I was in college anymore, I don\u2019t complain about bills because I still have enough for savings and to do things. I held on to the idea of all 3 of us having fun having a girls trip eating out together just living life but I can\u2019t do any of those things with them because they don\u2019t have money and every time I\u2019m with Abby I have to pay for her.\n\nThe nail in the coffin for this friendship was within the past 4 months. Abby told us she had a \u201cSugar daddy\u201d who\u2019s 67 and buys her things and they fool around and he makes her feel good. Candise cosigned and was happy for her and was saying she\u2019s been trying to find one herself. They had this long conversation about. I asked Abby \u201cdid you end things with your boyfriend?\u201d She said no she trying to figure out if she still wants to be with him and that she was thinking that this thing she has going with the sugar daddy will spice up the relationship. At this point I was done. I don\u2019t care about her sugar daddy it\u2019s whatever. It\u2019s the fact that she thinks sneaking around and cheating is spicing up the relationship when just 3 months ago she was crying over some cash app nudes her boyfriend received. I told her if she has to look outside the relationship there\u2019s no point. Unless they agree to an open relationship they both are just being with each other just to have the company and not be alone. She said she understood my point but I feel like she doesn\u2019t care. Candise kinda irritated me with her responses because she wants a man who treats her right, doesn't cheat, buys her things, rich, who doesn\u2019t want kids, that\u2019s good looking but doesn\u2019t want anything serious or get married. Marriage isn\u2019t for everyone I get that, but what she is asking for is a lot and she wants every single requirement I\u2019m not kidding.\n\nThey both have also forgotten my birthday completely. This is the 2nd year. It\u2019s only because I took my birthday off facebook because I felt there was no point in having it on there and that my real friends and family will know when it was. I was wrong. I don\u2019t even need facebook to tell me when theirs is. They don\u2019t even remember the month. I\u2019m not asking for a present I\u2019m just asking to be remembered. I go out of my to help them and do what I can and if they need my help I stop what I\u2019m doing to be there. When I need help or if I just need a friend, crickets. I recently started to become friends with my husbands friends wife Sarah. I only hung out with Sarah for 5 months. Not only did she remember my birthday, she threw me a surprise birthday party with all my husband\u2019s friends and their waives. I cried because I never had friends like that who cared and went out of their way. Sarah and I also went to a festival together. I picked her up from her house and she told me \u201cYou know I could have just met you at the festival you didn\u2019t have to go through the trouble to pick me up.\u201d I didn\u2019t realize it but she was right. She had a car a career and money to do things. I was so used to picking up Candise all the time it was just automatic. And for the first time I had a friend pay for me when we ate lunch. I was so used to always paying the bill because my old friends could not afford to or wouldn\u2019t come unless I would pay.\n\nTo this day I've been responding to the group chat less and less because literally all the messages are negative and depressing. I recently overcame depression and suicidal thoughts due to my stressful job, lack of friends and other issues I just don\u2019t want to get into. Every time I read the chat my anxiety spikes so I just stopped reading them. I know others may judge me but I feel like my old friends and I are on 2 different levels and want different things in life. I do wish them the best and I want them to do better.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

That's not really important to this particular story but that's how we met. We're really tight now and I'm glad we're friends again because we fell out over stupid stuff that didn't matter. \n\nSo anyways Sam's boyfriend, let's call him John, and I are really tight too. We like a lot of the same things and we're  close friends at this point.\n\nSo with that out of the way, my only two best friends are Sam and her boyfriend John, and I feel really lonely sometimes because I know they would do anything for each other but they would never do the same for me. I don't really feel like a third wheel persay, but I just know my place and I know that I'm less important. Recently whenever I try talking to one of them I get \"oh sorry I'm in a call with Sam/John I'll get back to you when I'm off\" and I just feel pushed aside. Everytime we do something and it's a compromise between us three, they always get their way. \n\nThe three of us are in a group chat and often they gush about each other in the chat like \"that's my baby I love you!\" And idk if I'm being dumb but it just kind of hurts seeing them gush about each other all the time and I'm just kind of sitting there like haha yeah. I guess I just feel lonely because I don't have any other friend's and I've never had someone genuinely love me before so it just hurts seeing two people who love each other so much but I'll never have anyone feel the same way about me. I hate that I feel jealous because I don't want to be bitter over other people's happiness because I don't want to be that kind of person but no matter how many times I've told myself to not feel that way I can't stop. I feel stupid and unreasonable because their significant others of course they're gonna care about each other more than me. \n\nI've started keeping things to myself because Sam tells John EVERYTHING, so if there's something I don't want John to know I know it's impossible because Sam will tell him anyways. Sometimes I'll be texting Sam and she'll take a screenshot of our conversation, send it to John, and then screenshot his reaction to it and send it back to me. I just feel exposed because I thought the conversations we had were private but I know that all my dirty secrets are out there somewhere because Sam tells John and her mom about everything. Like one time I was telling Sam about my family problems, and I thought this was hush hush between us but this one time her mom was driving us to Denver and I was talking about my sister and her mom went \"oh is that the one with all the problems?\" so I know she told her everything. \n\nI guess what really tipped me over the edge was my birthday. I feel like they kind of stepped all over me and were inconsiderate but I can't tell if I'm just being a baby and I need to get over it or if legit there was a problem. I don't have any other friend's to vent to really so I can't get any other outside opinions but anyways this is how my birthday went \n\nSo my birthday was the 1st and we all agreed that we'd spend Halloween together and I'd open my presents at midnight. That all went fine I felt really good and I got some thoughtful presents, but it all kind of went to shit the next day. \n\nSo Shane Dawson and Jeffree Star dropped some makeup pallette the morning of my birthday, and my friends wanted to get it really badly. She promised it wouldn't take long or whatever and I was like ok that's fine but inside I was a little peeved not gonna lie because we've been making birthday plans for a month but they dropped their pallettes only like two weeks before. But anyways she did her thing but something went wrong and the website crashed, so it took like four fucking hours for her to get her makeup. She kept apologizing about it taking too long and I was like it's fine it's fine whatever but inside I was upset because we were cutting into Birthday time. I wanted to go to this antique shop and they closed at 6:00, but by the time she bought the makeup it was 4:00 and none of us were ready so I was like there's no way we're gonna make it in time and we had to cancel our plans and do something else. When I texted her she told me she had been crying because the payment didn't go through and she had to wait longer to make sure the payment processed. \n\nSo we waited for everything to go through and we decided on going to the mall to make build a bears. I turned 19 and I made build a bears for my birthday and if you judge me for it I don't blame you lol. But anyways  we were making food plans before we went and I said I really wanted panda express. Now both John and Sam have diet restrictions, Sam has acid reflux and John is vegan/diabetic, so usually when we go somewhere they get to pick where we eat, and I was glad that for once I could finally choose where we eat. Well that's what I thought but they both said that they didn't like panda express but there was a Chinese food place in the mall that they liked better. So I was like whatever I don't care I'm getting my panda express and you guys can have your mall Chinese. So I sat there in the mall and watched them eat before we went to build a bear. \n\nBuild a bear was . . . Eh but it wasn't their fault I just didn't see a bear I liked but I made one anyways because I didn't want it to be awkward. I'm gonna return him but that's unrelated. Anyways we left the mall but by the time we left panda was closing in like 30 minutes, and by the time we got there they were out of the shrimp I wanted so I had to get something else. I was the one driving and we went to Target afterwards so by the time we got home it was cold and sad and I lost my appetite anyways. \n\nI just felt really disapointed because my birthday last year was really shitty (family medical issues I don't wanna talk about it) and I was hoping this year would be better but I just feel sad and unloved. I thought I would get over it but it's literally been almost a month and I'm still upset. I can't tell if I'm being selfish but I don't understand why my friend needed to get some stupid fucking makeup or whatever on my birthday and why it's so important. I feel bad being upset about it because she was genuinely excited for it and everyday she's been keeping us updated on the tracking/unboxing/swatches but I just feel shitty because they constantly remind me of my birthday. \n\nAnd the whole food thing, I don't understand why they couldn't suck it up for one day and eat somewhere they didn't like because I do it for them all the time. They could have packed a lunch or something and brought it with us because we always eat in my car anyways so it wouldn't be awkward. I just feel like I always make sacrifices for them but they don't give a shit about doing it for me. My friend always gushes about how amazing I made her birthday and how much fun she had with the three of us and I just wish I felt the same. I feel like I'm always left out and being used but I need an outside opinion because I can't tell if I'm just a shitty person with too high standards or if legit my friends aren't treating me right. \n\nAnyways if anyone actually read through this mess then I applaud you lol", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I don\u2019t know how we were able to tolerate each other for\nthis long because we are all very different. For some reason, we have come this\nfar. \n\n\nIn this group, two of them are supposedly the more intelligent one as\ncompared to me and another one of us, but the dynamics has changed once we have\nprogressed on in our lives where one has her own company, another is in a\nsenior position and myself in an MNC for many years and get promoted yearly and\ndoing extremely well. Only one, who is supposedly the smarter one, is not doing\nso well and does not celebrate any of our successes. I eventually came to terms\nwith it that she is probably jealous or unable to accept the fact that she\u2019s\nway back. A lot of focus was on her initially until\u2026 \n\n\nRecently, over the last one year, the rest of us been hanging out almost\nevery week more than we ever did for the last 19 years and I am starting to\nrealise the kind of friends I have \u2013 toxic. It did not occur to me until we\nstarted having more interactions and I realised one does not care about any thing\nthat is going on in my life. She spends most of the time talking about her own\nissues that I am almost living in her life. When I share mine, it does not get\nheard. \n\n\nThe other, is very subtle and cunning. She thinks she is very smart and\nknows everything and everyone must hail to her. She feels she is the most\nmatured because she is married, has her own house, business etc when in fact,\nher comprehending life is very immature. There were little things here and\nthere which adds up to me feeling that I am small and insufficient. There was\nonce, one of my GF introduced her new boyfriend to us and he was asking me\nwhere I am working, and this girl just had to add on that I used to work as a temporary staff\n(during my lowest period of my life) which was so unnecessary to add. Another\nincident where she mentioned in a conversation that he must be smart because he\nstudied in xx school (same school as her) which implies that the rest of us are\nnot smart. So, she has this thing wrapped around her head that she\u2019s the best\nand only the best. She gives many unsolicited advice although I did not ask\nwhich makes me wonder what gives her this idea that she knows the best? \n\n\nI feel very drained whenever I meet them, not refreshed. I cannot be myself\naround them, they have wrong idea about me because they do not know me. I want\nto end this friendship eventually because it does not help me grow to become a\nbetter person. The only thing that is holding back is where I have known them\nfor 20 years and it took me this long to realise the kind of friends they are\nand now, if I do not have them, I will have no more friends.

Perhaps you can call it the last recourse of my steady decline in my social life status... I recently had a falling out with my best friend, who had been my goddamn rock and literally meant more to me than anyone in the world, she was literally a sister to me. I never thought we'd stop being friends, we had the same mentality on things and had a million things in common and promised each other that we'd always be there for each other. I guess whenever I get that close to someone I enveloppe them into my life and talk to them every day about everything, aka they become my rock and I theirs. I've been close to people before, but this was different. I thought we were soulmates, copy paste of each other with different upbringings, kind of scary in a way. Anyway, she told me one day that she didn't know who she was without me, that she had been sucked up into my world and neglected hers... rather than mediating the situation she just cut me out her life. It was worse than any bloody breakup and I can't help but feeling a huge gap in my life. I feel like I'm never going to have a friend like that again, someone that just gets me. Hell, I've just kind of isolated myself because this whole thing made me depressed and idk how to get out of this rut. I try talking to new people and make plans with them but I feel like no one wants to be friends with me. Maybe I carry a bad aura or something but I'm sick of feeling this way. I've tried to date to make up the void of her leaving but I realize it wasn't healthy so I stopped. How do I fix myself? How do I deal with this?\n\nTldr: best friend left me because she didn't know who she was without me; lost, friendless, and lonely.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

And then he made a big argument about how I was in the wrong and he got mad. He is honestly just been a real jerk lately. Also when we are on phone calls with other people. We always make fun each person on the call but he always tries to aim hard for my feelings. I talked to him about it too and he said that it was nothing and I was overreacting. Maybe I am overreacting and this just some middle school crap but I don't know. Is this a toxic friendship? Help.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Advice needed.", "author": "jesuisdonc", "self_text": "For years and years, I've been lying to myself and to others that I wasn't a complete loner. I'd talk about slight acquaintances as if we were actually friends so my boyfriend thought I had at least some people in my life and I'd always hide my social media apps (Snapchat, FB Messenger) from people because I was so embarrassed that they'd see that no one was contacting me.\n\nNow I'm in a state of crisis because I've realised the brutal truth is that I have no friends. Not one. All I have is my boyfriend (who is lovely and has many friends of his own) and my family (but we're not that close anyway). \n\nAt the same time, I'm dealing with mental health issues (depression, social anxiety and an eating disorder). This year, I lost a close family member and it felt so shit to not have a single shoulder to lean on. I was initially so mad at every single person who has left my life in the past. I felt so angry that I have to suffer through all my problems alone. Now I'm just projecting that blame onto myself. I feel so unlikeable and even worse, so so disposable. I hate myself for having no friends. It's getting so triggering to see people hanging out with their own friends. This was something that never bothered me before, even when I had only one or two friends.\n\nI've been trying to step out of my comfort zone and meet people but my social anxiety is holding me back so much. For example, I've pushed myself to attend social events at work but it's incredibly difficult. I can't help but appear nervous and unapproachable. And my severe anxiety makes me seem like I'm not interested in meeting people when really I'm just so nervous that I'll come across as desperate and clingy if I put in effort.\n\nI don't know how I'm supposed to get myself out of this mess. I feel so utterly worthless and unwanted on the daily. And the worst part is that I can't even talk to anyone about it because I have no friends. \n\nPS: I've been to several GPs, psychologists and tried various medications throughout the years. Nothing seems to be helping.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

We met at work. She was my bridesmaid. We honestly became friends when we were both single and enjoyed going out together, finding guys, gossiping, and laughing. She\u2019s very funny and witty (but in a way that\u2019s more about making fun of people). I\u2019ve since gotten married and am expecting my first baby. She quit her job, and is living in an apartment subsidized by her father and doesn\u2019t work. Here are some facts about her. I really want to cut her out entirely because I believe she has treated me so horribly, but I don\u2019t want to be a crazy person who cuts people out randomly. Tell me if I have a case\n\n1. She cheats on her boyfriend. She allows her boyfriend to buy her first class flights. \n\n2. My husband and I rented a car and the entire time she made me sit on the floor of the car (limited number of seats) and refused to let me have a seat. I asked her \u201ccan I please sit down\u201d considering I paid for the car and she would never ever let me. She would be very comfortable saying to my husband \u201cno. My back hurts.\u201d\n\n3. My husband and I rented a house in France and invited her. She came and didn\u2019t offer to pay. Fine. She showed up and demanded her own room. She said she\u2019s getting a flight out now unless my husband and I gave her our room. So my husband and I had to sleep in the living room, in the house we paid for. \n\n4. At my rehearsal dinner, she got in a screaming match with a good friend of mine. It caused a huge stir and was very dramatic. \n\n5. She uploaded a pic of me and her where she looked pretty, but my nipple was showing accidentally (I had a nip\nSlip). When I asked her to remove it she was extremely nasty and then had her boyfriend message me saying to stop being \u201cmean\u201d to her\n\n6. She got her ex boyfriend arrested by telling the cops he hit her. He didn\u2019t. She made it up. He lost his job after that. \n\n7. She asked if she could stay with my husband and I in our tiny 1 bedroom apartment. After seeing how she acted on our trip, I was like...I\u2019m sorry my\nApartment is so small! We can\u2019t really have guests because we have no space at all! She actually\nArgued with me and was extremely rude. And like made me explain myself. \n\n8. She calls me hysterically crying about her psychotic fights with her boyfriend. They get in intense text message fights and they\u2019re like over 30. It\u2019s crazy behavior. I give her advice, she doesn\u2019t take it, and she continues to call me all the time and cry to me. She gets mad when I tell her the truth and try to give her actual advice. \n\n\nThere are so many more instances. She\u2019s now asking me to see her since she\u2019s in town / but something inside me has such intense dread. I just don\u2019t want to go through some crazy drama. \nShould I suck it up and be her friend? Or\nIs she completely toxic?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I had made friends pretty easily before but I tend to do that thing where you have different personalities for different friend groups.\n\nRecently I went through an experimental treatment called gene therapy which is an alternative choice to a bone marrow transplant. I had to do gene therapy because I had no matches and sickle cell was affecting my grades with all the hospital visits to treat my pain. The entire process was just fine and it was shorter than the bone marrow transplant would have been. Except there was a point where I contracted mucositis due to my weakened immune system (I went through chemo too) and I couldn't breathe one day. Apparently I passed out in the operating room and and was unconscious for 8 days. People have gotten mucositis before that did gene therapy but the doctors that were treating me hadn't see this before (reminder that this was an experimental treatment) and in that \"mini coma\" the doctors said that anything could have changed so I've been kinda waiting that out. I've been out of school for 4 months, soon to be 5, so the entire semester and I realized that I need to get new friends. My current friends are perfect, but there are so many people I've always wanted to talk to and be friends with and i dont even know how to start a conversation with new people anymore. \n\nTLDR: Had treatment, had mini coma in the middle of treatment, don't remember how to make new friends after realizing I need some of those.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

It is what it is\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nLate teens, with the same guy(who I\u2019m currently married to), had my best friend, and a couple acquaintances.\nThroughout this whole time, the one thing in common personality wise with me is that I was just super bitchy and negative. Like I was a pessimist about EVERYTHING.\n\nSo a few years ago, I decided I was tired of being like that. I made it a goal to be kind and positive and at least TRY to be a kind person. I\u2019m not perfect and make mistakes, but I\u2019m trying. Anyways, any kind of friend I\u2019ve tried to make over the past probably 2-3 years has turned out a massive bust. I\u2019m talking a girl who cussed me out because our job used a pic I took instead of one she took on its social media page and told everyone at our job I was trying to get her to kill herself when I told her I didn\u2019t think we were good for each other at all(that was a disaster), a girl who would act like we were best friends, and talk all kinds of trash about me behind my back and when I confronted her, she just said \u201cI\u2019m fake AF, it\u2019s who I am\u201d, and a girl who everything was great until I didn\u2019t back all of her ideas.

It takes me a min to get comfy, and then we\u2019re all good, but I also hate myself and don\u2019t really wanna show that ever. I\u2019m also a strong personality, and I know that.

Anyway, eventually we started to contact eachother and became close friends. \n\nAt first they were extremely nice, and considerate, and patient. But eventually they started to become a little bit ruder and less patient. That isn't weird, we became closer friends. But now, whenever we play a video game and I win, she starts screaming and cussing me out. She then leaves, and calls me back 10 minutes later like nothing else happened. They also are really weird about when I want to leave, especially when they freak out. They start begging 'NOOOO NONO NOOO DON'T LEAVE' and they even start (probably fake) crying and begging me to stay. I'm very nonconfrontational, so I just keep playing and get my mum to save me and say I have to leave. \n\nAm I in a toxic friendship, or am I just overreacting? I haven't said anything so far, and I don't know if I should. Thanks for reading.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Do you want someone to be really intimate with, and experience the joy of peeling the layers of their personality and getting to know them really, really well? Is constant touch and a deep connection something you really crave - and is it something you are willing to work for?\n\nI just need an open minded person to become really close with and talk to throughout the day(I'm quite flexible with time zones because of my erratic sleep schedule). I don't really have close female friends IRL and I have many good male friends already, so I would prefer to have one online.\n\nI finally got out of the crazy tiring semester and have some free time on my hands. I like to learn more about people's thoughts and lives and I am a very good listener and advice giver. Let's share our different opinions, interesting observations, things we think about in the shower, our pet peeves. Let's have long deep philosophical conversations, let's roast each other ;)\n\nA bit about me:- I like discussing and learning more about science, logic, mathematics, culture, philosophy, and playing some board/strategy games. I don't really believe in MBTI but if you do, I happen to be a textbook INTP.\n\nThink you're up for it and we're a good match? Think again - I have posted this same thing before, but still got most people who initially said they want the same thing but later randomly stopped chatting after a day or two and put little effort into the conversation. I've noticed that people online tend to be very volatile, and I'm looking for the opposite of that. I dislike ghosting/being ghosted or low effort conversations, so please message me only if you're at least somewhat talkative, and actually interested to prioritize an online relationship.\n\nHere are some quick questions:\n\n\u2022 Have you had online friendships lasting years - or do you end up blocking or ghosting most people that you message after a few days?\n\n\u2022 Do you tend to initiate a conversation most of the time - or do you always have other people texting you first so you don't really need to?\n\n\u2022 Are you genuinely interested in learning about people's lives and experiences - or do you tend to feel like most people are boring and you have high standards for what makes a person interesting?\n\n\u2022 Last, but not the least - do you have enough free time? It doesn't matter if we're otherwise very compatible - if you are juggling school, have multiple jobs, have an SO, and don't have the time to talk much, this won't work.\n\nIf you tend to resonate with the latter parts of the questions, perhaps it's best for us to not talk and possibly waste time and effort.\n\nIf you're still interested, send me a message via PM(NOT the new reddit chat, please, and include \"Ciao\" in your message) saying why you think we'd get along! It would be cool if you send me your Discord, Whatsapp or Telegram right away too as I don't like chatting on reddit :) Oh, and if you decide to message me, be prepared to get spammed with cute animal pics from around me.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

One day I was on Instagram and I clicked on her story, she had wrote something about her not having to see me at a concert because she got tickets to go to the other one, and unnecessarily called me ugly I was confused because I had done absolutely nothing wrong to her so I unfollowed her and told my friend, he then messaged her telling her to stop talking sh*t about me. She was really mad and started calling me names and ranting more about me on her story, making me sound like the bad guy and playing the victim. \n\nA few days had past and I hadn\u2019t heard anything from her, when I got a message. It was from Anna. Apparently some girl she used to be friends with had a crush on me and she was trying to \u201cwarn\u201d me about her because she was \u201csuch a terrible person\u201d. I didn\u2019t care, but eventually she apologized and I accepted her apology and tried to put things in the past. But noooo that\u2019s not the way things went at all. More days had past and I thought that everything was sorted, I was going to a concert in a few days with my friend (the same one Anna was going to) and posted something on my story along the lines of \u201ccan\u2019t wait for the concert!\u201d And tagged my friend in it. She saw my story and later I found out she had screenshot it and posted it to her story captioning it \u201cpetty c*nt is there any need\u201d I was once again confused and found out that she thought I was \u201ccopying\u201d her story layout. She then of course started talking more sh*t on her story about me, I confronted her about it and told her to stop but of course she didn\u2019t and started the immature name calling again. She keeps trying to seem all innocent and trying to make other people hate me. Might I also mention she lied about some extremely sensitive subjects. I\u2019m sorry this is so long, so if you read this all, thank you and please give me some advice on what I can do to deal with this.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

(btw, i'm a big fan of bulleted lists, so i'm about to use one to describe my interests, even if it does make this seem like some sort of job application or something)\n\n* i love music. some of my favorite bands/artists are Car Seat Headrest, Modest Mouse, Weezer, Radiohead, Neutral Milk Hotel, Remo Drive, Nirvana, AJJ, Brockhampton, Denzel Curry, and Frank Ocean. i also occasionally listen to some stuff like System of a Down, Eagles, Metallica, The Strokes, Pink Floyd, Queens Of The Stone Age, Slint, Have A Nice Life, Tyler the Creator, Kanye West, and Death Grips. I also play guitar, but I'm not very good at it yet.\n* i consider myself to be a bit of a meme connoisseur, so i can definitely hit you up with some spicy memes. I like all kinds of memes. Standard, deep fried, super ironic, incredibly offensive, surreal, historical, music-related, you name it. You can send them all to me.\n* i watch a ton of youtube. the stuff i watch varies from comedy/meme channels to sports talk channels to gaming channels to music discussion/review channels to informative/video essay channels, tech review channels, etc. youtube is definitely the website i visit the most (with reddit at a somewhat close second). Some of my all time favorite channels are Jacksfilms, theneedledrop, Middle 8, LEMMiNO, VSauce, Acai, AFunkyDiabetic, TVFilthyFrank (RIP), TheReportOfTheWeek, MrHurriicane, Foolish Baseball, Brett Kollman, SB Nation, Pyrocynical, iDubbbz, Fredrik Knudsen (Down The Rabbit Hole), and NakeyJakey.\n* i enjoy playing video games. the PC games i play the most would probably have to be Civ 5, Ring of Elysium, PUBG, Minecraft, and Overwatch. I have a quite expansive steam library due to steam sale splurges, though, so if there's a popular game you have, there's a decent chance I have it too. I also have Smash Ultimate on the Switch, and i'm very trash at it, but we could play that as well. I also like Pokemon quite a bit. I just got Sword and I'm really enjoying it, but the thing that interests me the most about pokemon is the competitive battling side of it. I can waste a lot of time trying to build the perfect team on Pokemon Showdown, lol.\n* i like watching TV shows. some of my favorites are Silicon Valley, Breaking Bad, Fargo, Mindhunter, Barry, Stranger Things, and Dexter. I'm not a big movie person, however. Not that they don't interest me, I just rarely set aside time to watch any movies that I didn't catch in theaters. If I had to give my all time favorite movie, though, it would probably be Fight Club.\n* i also like anime. some of the shows i've seen and enjoyed include Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Code Geass, Death Note, Soul Eater, Blue Exorcist, and Erased. i also plan on watching Evangelion soon since it's on Netflix now.\n* i'm a big fan of stand-up comedy. some of my favorite comedians are Bill Burr, John Mulaney, Bo Burnham, Tom Segura, Louis CK, George Carlin, and Mitch Hedberg.\n* i like watching sports. specifically basketball, baseball, and American football. my favorite NFL team is either the Packers or the Saints, although I like a few other teams such as the Falcons and Titans. my favorite MLB team is the the Braves, and my favorite NBA team is probably the Nuggets. i know sports isn't a very common interest throughout this subreddit, but i guess that would probably make it even more unique if we were to share it as an interest.\n* my MBTI personality type is INTJ\n\nso yeah, that's basically it. thanks for reading this long ass post, lol. feel free to PM me if you think we'd make good friends and we can talk somewhere. i prefer discord, but we can talk on pretty much any platform if necessary", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Back a few weeks ago, I saw pretty much all of my friend group going to a party that my boyfriend and I (both of us are in the friend group) were not invited to over someone else's social media. Of course my boyfriend and I wondered why we weren't invited and decided to ask one of our closer friends what was going on. I later learned from a best friend of mine we'll call Teresa that the party was in fact Jessie's birthday party! I asked Teresa why we weren't invited and she send screenshots to Jessie who then asked me over text to talk. She said our pda had gotten to be too much and the logical thing to do was to not invite either of us since she loved us both too much to just invite one. The thing is no one had told either of us that it was too much! Anyway I told my boyfriend and Teresa that Jessie seemed fake for not telling us about and excluding just us and I think that's when she blew up. I learned from Teresa and my boyfriend that she said I played the victim all the time and that I was dumb. We talked it out a day later and I was feeling better about the situation until I heard Jessie told Teresa that, \"She thinks we're cool but we're not.\" about hanging out with me. After this I wasn't feeling comfortable around Jessie again, so I stopped talking to her unless she approached me. She told my boyfriend (who she worked it out with at this point) that she wanted this all to end and so was going to text me that she didn't want to be friends. I wasn't going to give her the satisfaction and blocked her on all social media and her phone # and she sent my boyfriend a photo of her cursing me out. A very long paragraph but the main sticking point was the line \"After all I've done and been nothing but kind? F*** THAT AND F*** YOU.\" The next day she came to talk to me and she told me I need to talk to her instead of other people when I'm upset (which she is not wrong about.) However, her words still hurt and I don't know what to do. I know a big reason she lashed out was bc of other problems (family problems, ending a 10 year friendship with another friend) but I've always believed you shouldn't curse or say things you know are going to really hurt the person you're talking to, no matter how angry you are. Her excuse was she is human and feels things too, but I don't understand how you can talk about someone you love like that bc you're angry? How do I know she won't say those things again if she gets angry? Because of all of this, I don't want to talk to my friends or boyfriend about this for fear they might allude how I'm feeling to Jessie and she gets upset I'm not talking to her. But I don't want to talk to her because I don't know if she can fix this or if I can ever fully trust her again. Also, I'm in my senior year of high school so that also kind of changes things I guess.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

To give a little back round, I\u2019m a male in my late 20\u2019s and have been sober for over 5 years now. \n\nTo bring a long story short, I had a group of friends I had grown up with and was very close to my whole life. Over the past few years I have drifted apart from them. I don\u2019t know the reason, but randomly they would stop asking me to hangout. I know we have different interests now because I don\u2019t drink, but I still enjoyed being around them. Also, maybe they all just don\u2019t want to be around someone who is sober?\n\nWhat I\u2019m wondering is, has anyone had a situation like this? On one hand I know I need to move on from these friends, but on the other hand I\u2019ve known them my whole life. I am lonely in a way, and feel like I am constantly missing out. Because I\u2019m sober, I don\u2019t go out drinking and am constantly seeing Instagram stories and posts of them, realizing I was never even asked to come. It is such a shitty feeling. How can I move passed this, how can I feel good about myself even though I\u2019m not included in these things anymore. I am so lost and have become such a loner. I haven\u2019t let myself make new close relationships because I am holding on to hope my friendships with these people is going to rekindle. I also tell myself that nothing can replace friends you\u2019ve had since you were a kid, but maybe that isn\u2019t true?

I think I\u2019ll just ask him nicely to not send anymore stuff like that. What should I do?\n\nEDIT: Good news everyone, he unsent his message. Thanks for the advice, if it happens again I\u2019ll be sure to use it", "subreddit": "friendship"}

We would text pretty much all night, so much that we didn\u2019t have anything more to talk about. \n\nSo my mom messaged her mom to invite G to go to the movies with me. And her mom asks if my parents will be there, my mom says no since it\u2019s for a movie at a mall and we were both 14 at the time which she thought was old enough to walk around a mall for a little bit before a movie. So G\u2019s mom says no which we think is because of the parent thing. \n\nThe co-op has some fun classes and some more serious. You can choose what classes you\u2019ll take.  So I went back and G says that she\u2019s not coming back. Because it doesn\u2019t have the classes she need to graduate highschool. \n\nI\u2019m taking two art classes and one writing class. One art class is Highschool and the other is middle school. The middle school one is just so I can see friends. She could\u2019ve taken either of them for fun. \n\nSo G is adopted and is the youngest of 4 or 5 children and me and my parents think that G\u2019s mom just doesn\u2019t care anymore. So G\u2019s mom invites just me over to G\u2019s house for her birthday. \n\nI go and it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s was pretty boring because we didn\u2019t know what to do tho. So a little after I go over G\u2019s mom invites me too her birthday party which in late August while G\u2019s birthday is in February. \n\nMy mom says yes and we don\u2019t hear anything until a week before her party. No invitation or anything before that so we had made Plans to go to the beach instead. \n\nSo G texts me and says \u201cI can\u2019t believe you would abandon me on my birthday\u201d and I don\u2019t remember what I said back but I probably said something like what I just said but condensed. \n\nSo I have nothing to do on my birthday so my mom messages her mom to invite her. My birthday is August 2nd and G\u2019s mom replies \u201cG has volleyball tryouts on the 5th and 8th\u201d \n\nSo I text G and tell her what her mom said and she replies \u201cwell I do have tryouts\u201d I believe I just quite after that. \n\nSo fast forward to my birthday and I text G that I\u2019m going mini golfing, and she says \u201coh man that sounds like so much fun. I\u2019m just sitting at home bored\u201d \n\nSo later I found out that she apparently went to something that had reptiles at it I don\u2019t remember what it was exactly. But I remember the lizards because she had posted a pic of her holding a bearded dragon on her instagram story. Which I asked her about and she said that she saw it on my birthday. \n\nI send G memes on Instagram pretty much everyday and sometimes like every third day she\u2019ll send me a couple. \n\nWe don\u2019t really talk anymore, except for the memes and a photo on Instagram (it\u2019s kinda like the snapchat streaks but on Instagram). So I decided to start a conversation by seeing who the people in our class would be from a show we both like. \n\nSo I start talking and saying who the people are and she sometimes adds stuff but not really. So I say who I think she is and who I think my brother is. And she\u2019s just kinda there saying if she agrees or not.  \n\nI was kinda hoping she would say who she thought I was from the show but I didn\u2019t want to say anything cuz I didn\u2019t want to seem rude or something idk.  So she doesn\u2019t do that. \n\nAnd I keep trying to add stuff but it\u2019s hard cuz last year was my first year and I didn\u2019t really know everyone. And she\u2019s just letting the conversation die. Like I said I couldn\u2019t remember someone\u2019s name. And she\u2019s just like \u201ci don\u2019t remember everyone anymore\u201d\n\nShe went there for a long time. Idk the exact amount of time but it was long. \n\nSo she just stopped replying to the conversation and changed it to us sending pictures with no text or anything. \n\nShe also \u201cpranks\u201d me a lot. The pranks are her lying like one time she said she died and another time she said she had a boyfriend. Both done by text neither on April fools. So now I feel like I can\u2019t trust anything she says. \n\nThat\u2019s all I can remember. I feel like she doesn\u2019t want to be my friend and is just staying so I don\u2019t feel bad. \n\nSorry it\u2019s long and trash. I\u2019m new to reddit and just really needed to vent. \n\nTLDR\nMy friend let our conversation die and I never get to see her.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

It\u2019s bad to say but I have a gut feeling because things don\u2019t add up... that she might be lying. I only think this because all her pregnancy test came out negative and she kept refusing to see the doctor.  She says she thinks it\u2019s her fault and if she tells her ex, that he will blame her for it. I gave her all the advice I could give her... nothing is working. Her happiness revolves around her ex. I can\u2019t do anything to make her happy and she even has mentioned that he\u2019s her best friend so not sure where that leaves me.

These past few days have been a roller coaster of emotions, some bad and some good. The bad emotions I\u2019ve tried to talk it out with a close friend and the guidance counselor. I really thought it helped but it was really a band aid for the negative feelings I\u2019m having.\n\nI was quite an unhappy person in middle school. I only had my group of friends(7 of us in total) and I was really only close with two of them. We all hung out in a group cuz we knew each other. The second half of 8th grade was so bad. I felt so lonely I cried everyday. I wished everyday to leave me alone. I felt so left out and lonely and I felt like I had no identity. I didn\u2019t know who I was at all as a person. I wasn\u2019t exactly funny, the nicest, the most interesting, etc. I had such a boring life that I felt like I contributed nothing to the friendship group. I was constantly jealous of people\u2019s relationships and I\u2019m so glad those days are over. \n\nHigh school is when everything changed for me. In 9th grade, I did community service with my middle school friends and I met some amazing people that I\u2019m friends with now. The friends I met opened me up to a lot of new things and I started developing a personality. I had problems with my middle school friends because of these newfound relationships. That\u2019s okay, I became even closer to the only friend in that ms group that was on my side. Summer was a blast. I made a group of friends in high school and once I again I was closer to just one person in the group. \n\nBut here\u2019s when everything crashes. I just felt so lonely these past few days. As a person, I dislike how much I analyze people and their behavior. I\u2019m picky enough that finding the friends I want is hard. I feel like my high school friends are a group of people that came together because she knew her and I knew her and it just came to be. Besides one or two people, they\u2019re not people I could call to hang out with, to have a serious discussion w, nopeee. I love joking around and I make people laugh but I feel like I\u2019m carrying the conversation most of the time. I wish I had people I relate to.

I myself am mentally ill &amp; have been in the mental health system since 6 so I am aware of the severity &amp; was always helping him out. John is the oldest in the trio of friends.\n\nJack is better to some extent in life than John &amp; myself job wise, however it seems he still holds on to our 20s. On top of that, he actually has been using cocaine pretty often. I don't really try to tell people what to do with their life but I myself have a strong view against cocaine for personal reasons. He gets caught up on that from some associates of his.\n\nThe main thing that they both have is they are both cynical, pessimistic &amp; highly judgemental. We do joke about some taboo stuff, as guys do sometimes but some judgments rub me the wrong way, like John &amp; constant remarks of the gender identity issues &amp; how someone looks. There's a deep bitterness &amp; sometimes it borders on a hatred it feels like.\n\nJohn doesn't seem like he wants to progress that much or hold himself accountable with his mental illness issues. I definitely understand how barring mental illness can be, I go through it myself but I believe that doesn't excuse the accountability &amp; responsibility of managing it. He blames employers constantly for not hiring him or getting an interview when he only has had one job 10 years ago &amp; nothing else. He brings down the energy a lot with self centered actions &amp; narcissism.\n\nWith Jack, the main thing is he doesn't seem to take responsibility as well but also very critical &amp; judgemental. He'll scoff in a such a diminishing way when there's a view he doesn't agree with. He'll lecture you for 10 mins about a certain point from his view. He always needs to be right, same with John but it's more intense with Jack. There's been a fee things I opened up with him about &amp; same scoff &amp; dismissal happens depending on what it is. The main thing is the cocaine though.\n\nI've been having this thought because it doesn't seem they want to progress, mostly John, &amp; I have goals that I need to work on, that it might be time to move on from the friendships but I don't know if that's fair. I'm feeling the same way when I initially stopped talking to them.

And I had never had an adult friendship this strong. Over the course of those years MANY things have happened. Well it all started about 2.5 years ago right after my child was born she had told me that my husband was in a relationship with someone else. She made me swore I would never say anything to him. But instead, she befriended this other woman, hired her to do some work for her bonded and everyday my friend would tell me how much of an amazing person the woman was and much prettier and more well taken care of and smart and perfect and wealthy this woman was. Every day. So things started to get nasty. She wanted me to suck it all up and deal with it because I had an infant.  Over a year ago she called me one morning and that me that this other woman was pregnant and she was leaving town and didn\u2019t need my husband involved because I was told they he broke up with her before she had found out. \n\nFast forward to current times: I\u2019ve had enough. Almost everyday I am reminded by her of what had happened. Or that \u201cIm ugly and my husband cheats or any man cheats because of their spouse is ugly and busted\u201d so I broke and told him everything she had told me. \n\nNow he is swearing up and down it didn\u2019t happen. And I was finally given the name of this said girl and I can\u2019t find her on anything not even truth finder. So I don\u2019t know if it was all this huge fabricated lie or what. But now I have lost my best friend who I fell like I would rather die even though she\u2019s so toxic. I feel so hurt and lost and confused. And I\u2019ve never hated myself more than I do now. \n\nSorry for the long post to whoever reads it. It\u2019s just drama  but I literally have no one to talk to now.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Basically sums up the story of a friendship from freshmen-senior year to the present (sophomore in college-if I still attended) \n\nI\u2019ve kinda been around toxic friends/people for years so I just need some perspective on this. I\u2019ve known my friend for many years. We grew close when high school started. I remember my dad would pick her up in the morning and drive us both to the bus stop. Sometimes she\u2019d be late and we\u2019d miss the bus and we\u2019d have to wait. I told her once that i didn\u2019t want to pick her up anymore (i\u2019m assuming because i was upset with her about something/her lateness etc.) and she was guilt tripping me about it. She has always been the type of person to take her time getting ready, on halloween, her sweet16, other things. She also guilt trips to this day. I still think she isn\u2019t as considerate now and we\u2019re both 19. She is also insensitive to other ppls feelings. I had a boyfriend in high school and she\u2019d make fun of him and it made him insecure. Some of her jokes just come off mean instead of funny and she blames people for being too sensitive. I told her what she did was wrong and she apologized (i guess) but even now she\u2019ll just say the wrong things. Back then, she was friends with people i knew (toxic people we realized). I had my own group of friends at the time but it still hurt me when she wouldn\u2019t bother inviting me to things when she knew i was \u2018friends\u2019 with them too. That was a whole issue with not just her but those people, i won\u2019t get into it. Anyways, there was a specific event where my fam brought her along to six flags with us. Her family brought me places too. However, it was for the day before halloween and she was on the phone in the car. She was talking to one of those friends in the group about their plans on halloween (i don\u2019t think she brought them up to me). She was going to a party and my parents asked if we were hanging out for halloween and she was like \u201cnot this year\u201d. I thought it was very selfish of her to tag along and ALSO rush my parents to go home cause she had a curfew (which she did not mention until the day of) while not even bothering to ask if i wanted to come along. Then me and this girl we knew got close to me. There was a point where it was my friends bday and the girl i got close to asked my friend if i was going to be invited (i didn\u2019t tell her to ask) and my friend said no because all we do is send memes to each other. I suppose it was true but if you had an issue why didn\u2019t you say anything ? I just felt tossed aside by her actions throughout the years. We stopped talking soon after that because i told her all of the issues above and said i didn\u2019t wanna talk anymore. Senior year was when we stopped talking. We didn\u2019t talk for a whole year or more until a couple of months ago. \n\nLet me talk about present day. I was the one who reached out to her to be friends again. I suppose i missed her company &amp; i apologized for the falling out we had. She accepted my apology for saying i didn\u2019t wanna be friends anymore but warned me if i disrespected her again or something she\u2019d block me. I told her it wasn\u2019t fair to say that since she did things that hurt me as well. It was awkward at first talking to her but then we gradually started talking again and began to hang out. In high school, i was a much happier person compared to now. Currently i\u2019m going through depression/anxiety &amp;i dropped out of college. Most of the issues i have with her are centered around this. She had her own issues as well (she dropped out of hs) but is doing better. \n\nOur friendship was doing fine when we reconciled. I didn\u2019t see any signs of her being \u2018toxic\u2019, nothing really stood out because i didn\u2019t expect past issues to come up again. She doesn\u2019t hang out with those toxic people anymore either &amp; that was half the problem. But i started noticing things. One odd thing she did was distance herself when we began talking again but acted surprised when our friend group didn\u2019t invite her to things right away. During the time we didn\u2019t talk, she didn\u2019t talk to anyone from my friend group either but expects to be involved right away. i don\u2019t mind but if it was the other way around, she\u2019d take her time getting me back involved in a friend group. She also tries to invite herself places (family dinners or family things in general) which i would never ask because i have boundaries everyone has boundaries and that\u2019s something she doesn\u2019t understand. Or she\u2019ll ask why she wasn\u2019t included if me and my friend play Minecraft or something without her. Btw she has played without me and i asked her why and she explained why which didn\u2019t really make sense but oh well it wasn\u2019t a big deal to me but i hate how she\u2019s a hypocrite about it. She always expects me to voice chat all the time because it\u2019s \u2018more fun\u2019 but i literally hate being on the phone because of anxiety and she tries to pressure me. The biggest problem is how she treats me when i\u2019m depressed. Some days are harder than others and i admit, i used to rant to her A LOT but i no longer do. If she starts ranting or talking to me i always listen, i give advice in a positive way. She gives advice harshly and she said that\u2019s how she got better (because she was depressed herself) but i feel like telling me to \u201chelp myself\u201d over and over doesn\u2019t really qualify as you being there for me. Its just strange that someone who\u2019s said she\u2019s been suicidal in the past and someone who wants to be a therapist, treats people with depression or any other mental illness as someone who needs to fix shit on their own. If you self loathe for one day she\u2019ll be like wow couldn\u2019t be me (even though she does that constantly). She tells you to be on your own until SHES the one who needs help, then it\u2019s fine for her to ask for all the help she can get as long as it\u2019s convenient for her only. \n\nFor example, one kinda big thing that happened recently was our halloween plans. Me and her wanted to go to the city for an event. I was visiting my brother the night before the event so i thought ok i can travel from his house to the city it\u2019ll be much easier than going back home and spending more money etc etc. However, she didn\u2019t want to meet me in the city. She was saying how she wanted to take her sister trick or treating beforehand and thought we were leaving together at a certain time. I told her it\u2019d be easier and better for me if she met me because i like spending time with my brother. I rarely see him so i wanted to sleepover his house and i didn\u2019t want to spend extra money going back home then back to the city. She told me she wasn\u2019t comfortable because she was afraid of getting lost (she doesn\u2019t go out much, she uses uber, doesnt really take the bus) and she was afraid of traveling alone on halloween (something i\u2019d be doing too and it\u2019d be during the day so i didn\u2019t see the problem). I told her to use google maps and i\u2019ll help her if she needs help. She told me she had anxiety about it and didn\u2019t want to learn how to take public transport right this moment. I told her i have anxiety all the time and that it\u2019s an important skill to learn. The only reason it was solved was by me going home with my mom the day of halloween then traveling with her to the city. \n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous how when it inconveniences her, she\u2019ll pull the anxiety card. She gets defensive if you point this out. But if i say how depressed or anxious i am she\u2019ll be like just push through and do it. She says i can lean on her anytime but i just feel like i can\u2019t. She\u2019s guilt tripped me about hanging out in the past too. I told her i was depressed one day and wasn\u2019t up to hanging out and she was like but i really wanted to see you and things like that. Respect my space and mental health. You know, if i was healthy and not sad, i would go out of my way to see my friends, visit them, give them advice, whatever they needed. But all she tries to do is tell me how reality is 24/7 24/7. I get it, i know what i have to do. It doesn\u2019t happen overnight which is why i also need other people\u2019s help sometimes. I\u2019m not a robot. My other friends don\u2019t really catch on to these things she does so i feel alone and crazy for thinking the way i do. Should i say anything to her like what is the right course of action right now? Am i selfish for expecting her to support me ? Currently, i haven\u2019t really spoken to her about anything. We just send memes, talk about movies, whatever. We\u2019re drifting away again and i\u2019m not sure if i should let it happen or not. I already know she wouldn\u2019t say anything because that\u2019s just how she is, if something isn\u2019t fully resolved she\u2019ll leave it at that. Shes a great person to joke around with and she tries to say/do the right thing but talking to her about life in general just makes me angry so i\u2019m not sure what to do or if i\u2019m being rational/selfish. \n\nTL;DR: on and off friendship, starting to question if i\u2019m being bitter due to depression and if i should expect her support or if this friendship is \u2018toxic\u2019", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We met at middle school youth group on Wednesday nights for our church. And we got close then. Then through high school were also in the youth group together only a part one year because she was a grade above me. Not only did we go to youth group together but we also went to school together. I was with her when she first came out is bi, then a lesbian, And then when she wanted to become trans right before she went off to school for college. I didn\u2019t see her anymore even at church on the holidays since we were Roman catholic when her mom found out originally she kicked her out of the house. Thankfully with more changes she was able to join the military shortly after and is been home now for a couple years. She recently reconnected with me over the summer when she found my Facebook page. I was so happy though I guess I shouldn\u2019t be calling her she anymore I guess I should be calling him a he. He is recently been posting a lot about him going through transition and in about two months he\u2019s going to be getting his final surgery to make him a man. I always supported Kristian who is now Landon. We both grew up in very strict Roman catholic home and church. She was the first one I told I was bi. Only 2 of my friends know it other suspect, But I deny it Especially since I am living back at home with my parents due to health. So all of Landon\u2019s post on Facebook recently or about him getting his final surgery. And I told him great I\u2019m excited for him that he\u2019s finally going to be in a body that represents him. And it\u2019s true I am happy for him. But I\u2019m also kind of sad. Right before he went off to college I think we really stop talking because I felt that, as she was transitioning to Landon my friend Kristian was disappearing, And I feel like I could not connect with Landon the same way I connected with Kristian. So even though we only talk a little now in my head I still see him as Kristian and in my mind I\u2019m still fighting mentally to switch my thought from Kristian to Landon. And I feel like I\u2019m loosing our connection as friends the closer the surgery gets. I know what I\u2019m thinking is wrong and I really do want to help support him like I did after his parents kicked him out. I just need help to truly feel happy for him like I know I should.
